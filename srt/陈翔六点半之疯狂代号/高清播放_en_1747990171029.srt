Dong Ha Hsiao

I never suspect that 하 при gleich apo Lao

will come.

28
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,360
How simultaneously

29
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:28,640
and quite

30
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:42,740
wood.

31
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:12,520
ей

32
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,560
This is the time and location of the purchase of the transaction.

33
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,560
It's noon. It's 12.

34
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,560
The platform is all over the place.

35
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
Give me your phone.

36
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,560
I got it.

37
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,560
Wait a minute.

38
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,560
What's my number this time?

39
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,560
It's a big fish.

40
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,560
It's a number for me.

41
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:23,560
The

42
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,560
They have a few different types of guns.

43
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,560
Three different kinds, five similar stocks.

44
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,560
Where are the tankers?

45
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,560
The new model needs a find to stop the new manufacturer line.

46
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,560
Where's the plane?

47
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,560
It's already been upgraded and just waiting for the fund.

48
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,560
Call the factory.

49
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,560
I'm very interested in their project.

50
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,560
Okay.

51
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
Hello.

52
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,560
You guys are playing the commercial proposal.

53
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,560
We've already seen it.

54
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,560
He thinks it's okay.

55
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,560
He's personally made your platform.

56
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,560
You expect.

57
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,560
That's great.

58
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,560
I'll arrange a car to pick up Zhang Wei.

59
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,560
No need.

60
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,560
After all, your factory is now in the difficult times.

61
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,560
Difficult times are difficult.

62
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,560
There should be respect.

63
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,560
And the road to the factory is not easy to walk.

64
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,560
The driver is more familiar with the road.

65
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,560
Okay.

66
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,560
Send the car to Tian's financial center and pick up Zhang Wei.

67
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,560
Okay.

68
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,560
Everyone, be careful.

69
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,560
The investment manager, Zhang Wei,

70
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,560
will come to our factory to check it later.

71
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,560
Get ready.

72
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,560
Get ready.

73
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,560
Come on.

74
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,560
Li Li.

75
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,560
Li Li.

76
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
I'm a useless person.

77
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,560
I've been to the company.

78
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,560
I've never helped anyone.

79
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,560
How about this?

80
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,560
Go pick up Zhang Wei's car.

81
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
You arrange it.

82
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
Don't worry.

83
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,560
I'll take care of this little thing.

84
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,560
Brother Jin will take care of the whole thing.

85
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,560
Boss Wang.

86
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
Do you want some tea?

87
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,560
Help me pick up a boss at Tian's financial center.

88
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,560
His name is Zhang Wei.

89
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,560
That's my guest.

90
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,560
Since you're a guest,

91
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,560
I'll take care of it.

92
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,560
You know, I've been to the market for four times.

93
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,560
Isn't it just about money?

94
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,560
There's only a lot.

95
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,560
I didn't mean that.

96
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,560
I'm busy.

97
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
Don't worry.

98
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,560
I'll pick him up right now.

99
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,560
Your document.

100
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,560
Thanks.

101
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,560
Mr. Zhang, there is a lecture that wants you to advance to in his center.

102
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,560
An artist?

103
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
He's a lobbyist right now,

104
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,560
and he has prepared a performance for you.

105
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
Let's go.

106
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,560
I'll check it out.

107
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,560
But he also called Zhang Wei the same name as yours.

108
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,560
Well, forget it.

109
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,560
How dare he use the same name as mine?

110
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
Okay.

111
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,560
Good.

112
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,560
Good.

113
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,560
Good.

114
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,560
Good job, brother.

115
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,560
Good job.

116
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,560
Mr. Zhang Wei.

117
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,560
Hello.

118
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,560
You can go now.

119
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,560
Let me ask you the reason.

120
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,560
Your name is given as a chance.

121
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,560
This...

122
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,560
Tong, Jerry.

123
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,560
Who is it?

124
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,560
A guest.

125
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
Yes.

126
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,560
I'm going to you.

127
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
Four times.

128
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,560
Mr. Zhang Wei,

129
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,560
Press it.

130
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,560
Mr. Jang Wei,

131
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,560
Why do you call me?

132
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,040
and your health.

133
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,920
Okay.

134
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,560
Where are you?

135
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,120
I'm at the railway station.

136
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,840
I'm at Fan City.

137
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,320
Fan City?

138
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,360
Here.

139
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,800
You take the car to the railway station.

140
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,760
Call me.

141
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,680
I'll pick you up.

142
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,040
Where are you picking me up?

143
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,960
Hello?

144
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm at the underground building of the Tianxi Golden Dragon.

145
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,240
I mean...

146
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,440
I'm picking you up.

147
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,760
You're picking me up, right?

148
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,960
Yes, I'm picking you up.

149
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,920
I'll wait for you downstairs.

150
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,720
I have a few pants here.

151
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,280
You don't have pants?

152
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,480
Beichuan, it's cold here.

153
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,680
See you later.

154
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,480
Is your car okay?

155
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,280
No, it's okay.

156
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,400
I don't have any problems.

157
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,480
I'm not here.

158
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,040
You're in trouble.

159
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,280
Shut up.

160
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,400
What's wrong?

161
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,040
I'm so tired.

162
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,120
I'll buy you a new one.

163
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,520
What's the effect of the fire?

164
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,640
The problem is the smell of the car.

165
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,320
Let me tell you.

166
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,280
This is the real smell of the car.

167
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,640
If it's smelly,

168
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,360
the engine will become bigger when it's on.

169
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,400
The output is not normal.

170
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,120
When you drive,

171
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,840
the car will be in a mess.

172
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,760
The car will be out of control.

173
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,360
Really?

174
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,560
Yes.

175
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,760
This is not a normal smell.

176
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,560
It's all the smell of the car.

177
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,960
It's all the smell of the car.

178
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,440
Run!

179
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,480
Really?

180
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,880
I'll buy you a new one.

181
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,520
I want to buy you a new one.

182
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,720
You two,

183
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,000
don't you want to play with the mountain?

184
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,480
You're not listening to me.

185
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,880
You're eating.

186
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,440
I'll start to turn.

187
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,120
What's up, boss?

188
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,640
I'm Zhang Wei.

189
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,840
Boss sent me to pick you up.

190
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,120
So soon?

191
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,800
You must be mistaken.

192
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,880
Are you a private investigator?

193
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,960
Do you speak Chinese?

194
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,480
Yes.

195
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,760
Do you know the iron ore mine?

196
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,320
Yes.

197
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,840
Then,

198
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,920
I'll show you the iron ore mine.

199
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,640
I'll show you the iron ore mine.

200
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,600
I'll show you the iron ore mine.

201
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,240
I'll show you the iron ore mine.

202
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,560
I'll show you the iron ore mine.

203
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,280
Yes.

204
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,760
Then, it's your turn.

205
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,680
Go!

206
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,440
Get in the car!

207
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:21,920
OK.

208
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,760
Come on.

209
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,120
Boss Wang.

210
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,680
OK.

211
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,120
Let's go.

212
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,520
Go!

213
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,920
Be safe.

214
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,920
Get ready to go.

215
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,960
Mr Zhang, the car has arrived.

216
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,880
All right.

217
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,240
You can leave now.

218
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,480
Are you sure you don't want me to go with you?

219
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,440
The driver's seat will take care of me.

220
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,120
OK.

221
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,920
Good luck.

222
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,680
Bye.

223
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,280
You...

224
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,200
Can you get in the iron ore mine before midnight?

225
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,440
No problem.

226
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,720
Go!

227
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,480
Get in the car!

228
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,400
Get in the car!

229
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,960
Come on.

230
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,280
Here.

231
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,520
Be careful.

232
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,180
From your condition,

233
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,900
you will be honest.

234
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,640
Then we stay in the car.

235
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,560
But...

236
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,720
Seriously.

237
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,140
You are going to farm again?

238
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,920
If we have no company,

239
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,960
then we cannot go anywhere.

240
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,040
Stop!

241
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,680
Sak이랑

242
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,040
Hang around

243
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,720
Yuo journalist

244
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,040
Yolo

245
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,640
Shape it for me

246
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,440
Yolo

247
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,640
Well you know what?

248
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:41,400
This part is quite non-f Doggers car race to excited...

249
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,240
To ride or comfort...

250
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,160
Oh...

251
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:57,200
Look.

252
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,920
Uh?

253
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:14,120
How do youAN?

254
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,120
It's okay.

255
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,120
Bro, what's wrong with you?

256
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,120
I'm so busy.

257
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,120
I'm busy.

258
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,120
It's okay.

259
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,120
I'm busy.

260
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,120
Miss Pan, you tell Tim that the driver is hard-wired and professional.

261
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,120
And is it hard to respect their inverse trust?

262
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,120
Look at the car. It's so cool.

263
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,120
It's so cool.

264
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,120
Bro, you drive slower.

265
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,120
We're leaving.

266
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,120
There's a lot of fun on the road.

267
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,120
Be careful.

268
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,120
Hey!

269
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,120
Where are you going?

270
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,120
To the park.

271
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,120
Can you be a man?

272
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,120
Can we be a man?

273
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,120
What's wrong with you?

274
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,120
What's wrong with you?

275
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,120
Nothing. I'm just holding it.

276
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,120
What's wrong with you?

277
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,120
What's wrong with you?

278
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,120
You're so angry.

279
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,120
You're so angry.

280
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,120
You're so angry.

281
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,120
What's wrong with you?

282
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,120
You're so angry.

283
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,120
Get me a glass of wine.

284
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,120
No, thanks.

285
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,120
I'm not a man.

286
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,120
Who's that?

287
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,120
Hello, Mr. Tang.

288
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,120
I'll pay you 500 yuan.

289
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,120
You must respect my customers.

290
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,120
I respect them.

291
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,120
I'm a man.

292
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,120
I'm a man.

293
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,120
I'm a man.

294
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,120
I'm a man.

295
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,120
I'm a man.

296
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,120
I'm a man.

297
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,120
Hey, Mr. Tang.

298
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,120
Put your gun up.

299
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,120
Put it on the table.

300
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,120
Don't you dare to kick my ghost.

301
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,120
Ghost.

302
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,120
Ghost.

303
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,120
I'm a man.

304
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,120
I'm a man.

305
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
I'm a man.

306
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,120
I'm a man.

307
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,120
I'm a man.

308
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,120
I'm a man.

309
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,120
I'm a man.

310
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,120
I'm a man.

311
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,120
I'm a man.

312
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,120
Thank you.

313
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,120
Be careful.

314
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,120
I'll hit your butt.

315
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,120
Don't hit me.

316
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,120
Get me a glass of wine.

317
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,120
What's wrong with you?

318
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,120
I'm a man.

319
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,120
I'm a man.

320
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,120
No.

321
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,120
I usually drink more champagne.

322
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,120
Excuse me.

323
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,120
What in the country are you?

324
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,120
You're not a man.

325
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,120
Yes, I am.

326
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,120
I'm a man.

327
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,120
I'm a man.

328
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,120
You're a man.

329
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,120
I'm a man.

330
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,120
I'm a man.

331
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,120
I'm a man.

332
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,120
I'm a man.

333
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,120
This word...

334
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
You're making people misunderstand.

335
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,120
How can you misunderstand?

336
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,120
The word,

337
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,120
in my opinion,

338
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,120
is...

339
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,120
Forget it.

340
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,120
You don't understand.

341
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,120
Actually,

342
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,120
I'm shooting a video.

343
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,120
I've been doing this for a long time.

344
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,120
This is the word.

345
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,120
My love is out of the mountain.

346
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,120
This...

347
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,120
This is the real thing.

348
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,120
This is the most important point in the car.

349
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,120
Sir.

350
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,120
You're talking about the right thing.

351
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,120
You're wrong.

352
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,120
You're not a man.

353
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,120
I'm a man.

354
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,120
Don't be so serious.

355
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,120
Are you sure?

356
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,120
You're afraid?

357
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,120
You're going to the top of the mountain.

358
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,120
¡Gin Iron lac Castle!

359
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,120
Trans ciento Goodman

360
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,120
Chelsea Lee

361
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,120
This is Hampton confluence.

362
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,120
These types of street cats

363
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,120
should be the catties in the village.

364
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,120
Until the plaza is under construction,

365
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,120
it's full of corridors.

366
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,120
There's another city in the north.

367
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,120
There was a mine in the past.

368
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,120
But then there was no more.

369
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,120
It was gone.

370
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,120
It was left behind.

371
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,120
It was gone.

372
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,120
You drive well.

373
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,120
It's dangerous.

374
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,120
It's a strange thing.

375
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,120
I'll hit you.

376
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,120
Go, go, go.

377
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,120
Sanger, the money you bought

378
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,120
is all in the bank.

379
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,120
It's all in the bank.

380
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,120
I'll keep those contracts

381
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,120
and keep them in your hands.

382
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,120
If they want to die

383
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,120
and come to the fortress,

384
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,120
I'll send them down to find you.

385
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,120
Send them down?

386
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,120
Sanger, the time is almost up.

387
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,120
Go, get the gun.

388
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,120
Move!

389
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,120
Move!

390
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,120
Go, go, go.

391
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,120
What's that?

392
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,120
It's a book.

393
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,120
The most beautiful owner of mine

394
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,120
is Wang Yingren.

395
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,120
Next, I'll give you

396
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,120
your favorite box.

397
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,120
Go, go, go.

398
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,120
Hey, friend, where are you?

399
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,120
I'm here.

400
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,120
I'm out.

401
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,120
I'll give you 300.

402
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,120
You're a good boy.

403
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,120
It's me.

404
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,120
You're Zhang Wei?

405
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,120
To be honest,

406
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,120
you should call me Mr. Zhang Wei.

407
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,120
Mr. Zhang.

408
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,120
Where are you?

409
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,120
Master,

410
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,120
how long do you still have to wait?

411
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,120
I'll be right back.

412
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,120
Let's go.

413
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,120
Mr. Zhang,

414
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,120
you must be going to your factory.

415
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,120
Is it possible for me to talk here?

416
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,120
Will you do something?

417
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,120
I've told you,

418
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,120
it's better for us to go.

419
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,120
Let's go.

420
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,120
I'm talking about money.

421
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,120
The money is in the shed.

422
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,120
I'm talking about money.

423
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,120
I'm talking about money.

424
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,120
I'm talking about money.

425
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,120
I'm talking about money.

426
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,120
I'm talking about money.

427
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,120
What are you talking about?

428
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,120
It's dangerous.

429
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,120
We're almost there.

430
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,120
Don't you want to go to the police?

431
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,120
I'm afraid.

432
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,120
I'm not afraid of the police.

433
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,120
Wei Ke,

434
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,120
if you don't want to go,

435
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,120
we'll be there.

436
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,120
I'll kill you.

437
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,120
Don't worry.

438
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,120
I won't say anything.

439
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,120
Thank you.

440
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,120
I understand.

441
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,120
You can take the money.

442
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,120
No, I can't.

443
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,120
Take it.

444
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,120
Thank you.

445
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,120
Thank you.

446
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,120
Sorry, I was wrong.

447
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,120
Wait for me.

448
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,120
Wait for me.

449
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,120
Get out.

450
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,120
Wei, I'm here.

451
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,120
I'm Zhang Wei.

452
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,120
What are you talking about?

453
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,120
Talk.

454
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,120
Wait for me.

455
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,120
What are you talking about?

456
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,120
It's okay.

457
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,120
Wei, can you hear me?

458
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,120
Can you hear me?

459
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,120
No.

460
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,120
Thank you.

461
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,120
It's okay.

462
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,120
You're funny.

463
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,120
You're so bold.

464
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,120
Find a place where you can be alone.

465
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,120
I understand.

466
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,120
Go there.

467
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,120
Follow me.

468
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,120
Here you are.

469
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,120
Welcome.

470
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,120
Mr. Tang.

471
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,120
Thank you.

472
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,120
This is the place for the guests.

473
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,120
This is our toy factory.

474
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,120
My toy factory?

475
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,120
Mr. Zhang Wei, welcome.

476
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,120
Don't go.

477
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,120
Mr. Zhang, please.

478
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,120
Thank you.

479
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,120
Mr. Zhang, can I help you?

480
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,120
No problem.

481
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,120
Mr. Zhang.

482
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,120
Mr. Zhang, please introduce yourself.

483
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,120
This is my husband.

484
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,120
Mr. Zhang.

485
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,120
You have a husband?

486
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,120
We've been married for ten years.

487
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,120
Mr. Zhang, please.

488
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,120
Welcome Mr. Zhang.

489
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
Welcome Mr. Zhang.

490
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,120
Welcome Mr. Zhang.

491
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,120
This is your factory?

492
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,120
The food?

493
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,120
It's from the old days.

494
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,120
It's a little bit lacking.

495
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,120
I'm lacking money to get my business.

496
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,120
Come on, get the stuff out.

497
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,120
No hurry.

498
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,120
Where's the meeting place?

499
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,120
It's different from yesterday.

500
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,120
Old man, come on.

501
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,120
Let's go.

502
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,120
No.

503
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,120
Didn't you hear that?

504
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,120
This is my shop.

505
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,120
This is my shop.

506
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,120
It's okay.

507
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,120
You can have your own.

508
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,120
Okay.

509
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,120
Is it safe?

510
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,120
Safe?

511
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,120
I've never had a safety problem here.

512
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,120
I'm sorry.

513
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,120
You go back to the fridge.

514
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,120
You're much younger than I thought.

515
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,120
You don't think I'm old?

516
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,120
You're still young.

517
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,120
But you can understand.

518
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,120
Who is the normal person?

519
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,120
You're not young.

520
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,120
You're not young.

521
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,120
Who is the normal person?

522
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,120
I think you're interesting.

523
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,120
I'm more satisfied with you.

524
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,120
If you're satisfied,

525
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,120
we can go to the trouble.

526
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,120
We can go straight to the topic.

527
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,120
What are you doing?

528
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,120
Young people, don't be so hasty.

529
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,120
Come on.

530
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,120
You don't know who I am.

531
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,120
You have to take responsibility for yourself.

532
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,120
Sit down.

533
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,120
Come on.

534
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,120
What do you want?

535
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,120
A cup of coffee.

536
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,120
I'll take the coffee.

537
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,120
Come on.

538
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,120
Please.

539
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,120
He's your only friend?

540
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,120
We have three partners.

541
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,120
I don't know who they are.

542
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,120
Call him over.

543
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,120
He's waiting in the hotel.

544
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,120
What's going on?

545
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,120
Please turn him over.

546
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,120
Please avoid him.

547
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,120
No, I'm sorry.

548
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,120
I want to see him.

549
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,120
What's the core of your team?

550
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,120
I think it's a bit too much for you.

551
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,120
I only asked one question.

552
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,120
We're just afraid of death.

553
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,120
That's good.

554
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,120
Doing business is the spirit of not afraid of death.

555
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,120
What's your team's wish?

556
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,120
What wish?

557
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,120
I don't know why.

558
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,120
I wish you good luck.

559
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,120
Sanger,

560
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,120
you must fulfill your wish.

561
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,120
You must be strong.

562
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,120
You must be strong.

563
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,120
You must be strong.

564
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,120
You must be strong.

565
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,120
You must be strong.

566
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,120
You must be strong.

567
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,120
Good.

568
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,120
You both are very brave and diligent.

569
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,120
You both are very brave and diligent.

570
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,120
This wish is very good.

571
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,120
But you can't use the word robber.

572
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,120
In our industry,

573
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,120
robber's behavior is called

574
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,120
robber's wine.

575
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,120
Like you said,

576
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,120
robber's wine is the best.

577
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,120
Robber's wine is the best.

578
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,120
The last one,

579
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,120
robber's wine is the best.

580
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,120
Of course.

581
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,120
Good.

582
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,120
One more question.

583
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,120
Let's talk about your project's life cycle.

584
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,120
What life cycle?

585
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,120
It's all about our reputation and reputation.

586
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,120
Why do you think we're dead?

587
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,120
I mean,

588
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,120
how long can this project last?

589
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,120
How long?

590
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,120
It's been a long time.

591
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,120
I'm sure you'll give us a lot of bullets.

592
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,120
As long as you're good at cooking,

593
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,120
I'll give you as much bullets as you want.

594
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,120
Good.

595
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,120
Good.

596
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,120
Good.

597
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,120
Good.

598
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,120
Brother Zhang,

599
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,120
we're a family.

600
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,120
We're a company.

601
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,120
From the elders,

602
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,120
we're all working on this restaurant.

603
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,120
I really want to

604
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,120
make it a success.

605
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,120
But now,

606
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,120
we're in trouble.

607
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,120
You know, this is a real market.

608
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,120
I'll break it.

609
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,120
You can do whatever you want.

610
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,120
I don't care.

611
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,120
I'm here to

612
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,120
make money

613
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,120
by trading.

614
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,120
Brother Zhang,

615
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,120
you're so nice.

616
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,120
Have you read our files?

617
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,120
I'll just read them on the computer.

618
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,120
I heard you say

619
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,120
this is also a rumor.

620
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,120
I can still bear the pain.

621
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,120
Since you've said it,

622
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,120
I'll say my opinion.

623
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,120
In my opinion,

624
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,120
shouldn't this be a resumption?

625
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,120
She...

626
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,120
She's not a good girl.

627
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,120
She's a good girl.

628
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,120
She's a good girl.

629
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,120
Brother Zhang,

630
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,120
don't worry.

631
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,120
I won't participate in this.

632
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,120
I'll just watch

633
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,120
and play.

634
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,120
What's your problem now?

635
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,120
The problem

636
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,120
is that

637
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,120
there's nothing wrong with it.

638
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,120
Okay.

639
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,120
How about

640
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,120
we

641
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,120
start?

642
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,120
Now?

643
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,120
Yes.

644
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,120
Okay.

645
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,120
Where are we going?

646
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,120
The meeting room.

647
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,120
Meeting room?

648
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,120
Shouldn't we find a private place?

649
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,120
The meeting room is spacious.

650
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,120
I and the company's shareholders

651
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,120
want to witness this moment.

652
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,120
You want to watch?

653
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,120
Yes. We've been waiting for this moment for a long time.

654
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,120
We're all close friends.

655
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,120
No outsiders.

656
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,120
I'm afraid this is really necessary.

657
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,120
Such an important thing.

658
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,120
We all want to witness it.

659
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,120
I want to witness it.

660
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,120
After all, it's a big sum of money.

661
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,120
Please.

662
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,120
Then I'll think about it.

663
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,120
How big is the sum of money?

664
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,120
Three hundred dollars.

665
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,120
Is it okay?

666
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,120
Brother Zhang.

667
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,120
Brother Zhang.

668
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,120
What's wrong with you?

669
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,120
Why did I hold this trash can?

670
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,120
You fainted when you heard it.

671
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,120
You were happy to hold this trash can.

672
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,120
What?

673
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,120
Are you okay?

674
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,120
I'm fine.

675
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,120
Brother Zhang.

676
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,120
Three hundred dollars is not appropriate.

677
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,120
How about two hundred dollars?

678
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,120
I think this is a million-dollar thing.

679
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,120
It's getting bigger.

680
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,120
It's too much of a challenge.

681
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,120
Is there a bathroom?

682
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,120
There is a bathroom upstairs.

683
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,120
I need to go to the left.

684
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,120
Brother Zhang.

685
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,120
Go slowly.

686
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,120
No hurry.

687
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,120
One hundred dollars.

688
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,120
One hundred dollars.

689
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,120
Honey.

690
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,120
No hurry.

691
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,120
There will be a way.

692
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,120
I like watching movies.

693
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,120
I like reading poems.

694
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:47,120
I hope I can find that person in a million people.

695
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,120
In the long time.

696
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,120
Just at that moment.

697
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,120
Speak gently.

698
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,120
You are here too.

699
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,120
What's all this mess?

700
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,120
How about...

701
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,120
Let's look at the gun first.

702
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,120
Why are you so stupid?

703
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,120
It's so inappropriate.

704
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,120
What's so inappropriate?

705
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,120
We are old.

706
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,120
We want to find a mutual understanding.

707
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,120
A mutual trust.

708
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,120
To build a more long-term.

709
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,120
A longer and more old relationship.

710
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,120
What do you want?

711
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,120
Trust.

712
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,120
Don't worry about trust.

713
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,120
I have a mouth to drink.

714
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,120
Let's fix it.

715
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,120
What's the hurry?

716
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,120
You are not in a hurry.

717
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,120
I'm not in a hurry.

718
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,120
Open the door.

719
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,120
Okay.

720
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,120
Come in.

721
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,120
What's wrong?

722
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,120
I'm fine.

723
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,120
Calm down.

724
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,120
You...

725
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,120
You are...

726
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,120
I just wanted to help you wipe the window.

727
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,120
If you don't have the right to stand, you can throw it out.

728
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,120
Sister Lan, this is...

729
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,120
My blind date.

730
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,120
You can have it.

731
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,120
I'm busy with you.

732
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,120
We have a mission.

733
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,120
We will not affect you.

734
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,120
It's okay. You can have it yourself.

735
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,120
I'll do it.

736
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,120
Are you okay?

737
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,120
I'm fine.

738
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,120
Are you afraid of the police?

739
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,120
Aren't you afraid?

740
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,120
I'm not afraid.

741
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,120
It's okay.

742
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,120
How many people are in your family?

743
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,120
How many people are in my family?

744
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,120
Only one person in my family.

745
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,120
Really?

746
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,120
Yes.

747
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,120
Do you men

748
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,120
like women in our age?

749
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,120
Yes.

750
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,120
How can they be limited by age?

751
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,120
Right?

752
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,120
Yes.

753
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,120
No way.

754
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,120
Really?

755
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,120
Yes.

756
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,120
I don't think so.

757
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,120
I don't have the courage.

758
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,120
Love

759
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,120
really needs courage.

760
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,120
To face those

761
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,120
rumors.

762
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,120
I will say the truth.

763
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,120
Only you

764
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,120
can see

765
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,120
my love.

766
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,120
Love

767
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,120
love

768
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,120
love

769
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,120
love

770
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,120
What do you want?

771
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,720
Is this a guitar?

772
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:38,920
No.

773
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:39,720
Open it.

774
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,120
Come on.

775
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,320
No need.

776
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,120
Comrade,

777
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,120
it's very necessary to perform the talent at this time.

778
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,120
Really?

779
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,320
So open it.

780
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,320
Come on.

781
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,120
You think it through.

782
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,720
Really open it.

783
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,520
It's okay.

784
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,320
You can't sing.

785
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,120
They won't catch you.

786
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,720
Open it.

787
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,420
Open it.

788
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,120
You can still sing.

789
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,520
Yeah, your fashion has such an advantage.

790
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,520
It'sect Jurassic doesn't make you silly.

791
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,520
You think so?

792
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,720
The fashion's balanced by this face.

793
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,920
Otherwise, it you could throw your head off.

794
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:33,720
Come on.

795
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,120
What's the matter?

796
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,120
I have a little favor to ask.

797
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,120
Help me fill up the form.

798
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:49,120
We have too many dishes in this bowl.

799
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,120
Xinming,

800
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,120
wait for the pot.

801
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,120
Which pot?

802
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,120
Bo Yan pot,

803
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,120
wait for the pot.

804
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,120
What about you?

805
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,120
I'm a good cook.

806
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,120
Bo Yan pot, right?

807
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,120
Yes.

808
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,120
Xinming,

809
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,120
what's the matter?

810
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,120
What's your job?

811
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,120
I'm a cook.

812
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:21,120
I'm a cook now.

813
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,120
You're a cook?

814
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,120
I have a lot of jobs in the restaurant.

815
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,120
I'm a cook.

816
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,120
I'm the boss, he's the boss.

817
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,120
I'm the boss.

818
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,120
You fill up the form.

819
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,120
I want to drink this wine.

820
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,120
I'll wash my hands.

821
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,120
The pot is not good.

822
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:51,120
Xinming is worse than the housekeeper.

823
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,120
Brother,

824
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,120
I have a feeling that I'm a bad cook.

825
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,120
You're really a bad cook.

826
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,120
I have never seen you before.

827
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,120
You're not a good cook.

828
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,120
I'm sorry.

829
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,120
I'm a good cook.

830
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,120
What's the matter?

831
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,120
I'm a good cook.

832
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,120
I'm a good cook.

833
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,120
I'm a good cook.

834
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,120
I'm a good cook.

835
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,120
I'm a good cook.

836
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,120
Here you are.

837
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,120
Here you are.

838
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,120
I'm here to pay for the food.

839
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,120
What's the matter?

840
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,120
You're overestimating me.

841
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,120
What's the matter?

842
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,120
Well,

843
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:49,120
I have to ask you something.

844
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,120
Are you a good cook?

845
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,120
You're a good cook.

846
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,120
If you're a bad cook,

847
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,120
you can't work with me.

848
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,120
I'm not a good cook.

849
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,120
I'm a good cook.

850
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,120
I'm a good cook.

851
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,120
What?

852
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,120
You're a bad cook.

853
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,120
I'm a bad cook.

854
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,120
I'm a good cook.

855
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,120
You're a good cook.

856
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,120
What?

857
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,120
You're a bad cook.

858
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,120
You're a bad cook.

859
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,120
I'm sorry.

860
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,120
I have a misunderstanding.

861
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:44,120
Your cooking is real.

862
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,120
I'm a good cook.

863
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,120
I'm a good cook.

864
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,120
Brother Liang,

865
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,120
I'm sorry.

866
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,120
I have to go.

867
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,120
I have to go.

868
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,120
I'm fine.

869
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,120
I'm fine.

870
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,120
I'm fine.

871
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,120
What's the matter?

872
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,120
I'm a good cook.

873
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,120
I'm a good cook.

874
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,120
I'm sorry.

875
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,120
I'm sorry.

876
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,120
Brother Liang,

878
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,120
I'll leave.

879
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,120
Brother Liang,

880
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,120
do you think it's okay?

881
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,120
He said it's okay.

882
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,120
It's good.

883
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:46,120
He said it's okay.

884
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,120
I'm done!

885
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,120
Brother Liang Ha 85

886
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,120
No, no, no...

887
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,120
Don't tell us that.

888
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,120
I just give up.

889
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,120
mercy

890
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,120
Li Blue

891
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:21,120
Boss, I'll get off work today.

892
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,120
Enjoy your time.

893
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,120
Close the door.

894
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,120
I'm not like this.

895
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,120
I'm not like this.

896
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,120
I'm not like this either.

897
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,120
I'm not like this.

898
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:49,120
You are really interesting.

899
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:54,120
You are boring.

900
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,120
What do you mean?

901
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,120
I think it's okay.

902
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,120
I'm leaving.

903
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,120
I have to do something serious.

904
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:06,120
Isn't that the same thing?

905
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,120
What do you mean?

906
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,120
I mean

907
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:17,120
we can watch a movie together.

908
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:21,120
We can sing and sing together.

909
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:24,120
We can do some interesting things.

910
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,120
You are bored.

911
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,120
Take the ball here.

912
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,120
What do you mean?

913
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,120
Changge.

914
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,120
Changge.

915
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,120
We can't do this.

916
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,120
We just want you.

917
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,120
No, no.

918
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,120
We just want you.

919
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,120
Then I'll ask you.

920
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,120
Can't you do it?

921
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,120
I can't do it.

922
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:22,120
I'm a useless person.

923
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:25,120
I've been trying to help the Zhao family for so many years.

924
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,120
I want to help the Zhao family.

925
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,120
I want to help the Zhao family.

926
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,120
I can't do it.

927
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,120
Changge, I'll do it for you.

928
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,120
No, no, no.

929
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,120
I beg you.

930
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,120
Please help us.

931
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,120
We still have 3 million.

932
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,120
Changge.

933
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,120
Changge.

934
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,120
Changge.

935
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,120
Okay.

936
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,120
3 million is good.

937
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,120
I'll take a shower first.

938
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,120
You run.

939
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,120
I'll take care of it.

940
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,120
Master Liu.

941
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,120
Did you take the wine team with me last time?

942
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,120
Okay.

943
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,120
Please contact me.

944
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,120
Okay.

945
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,120
Fang'er.

946
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,120
I'm not going to leave.

947
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,120
I asked you again.

948
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,120
What's your purpose?

949
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:15,120
I'm a temple investment investor.

950
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,120
I'm a Ihnener.

951
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:21,120

00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,120
I'm a Ihnener.

954
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,120
I'm sorry.

955
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,120
This is not right.

956
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,120
This is too little.

957
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,120
I'm a temple investment investor.

958
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,120
I'm sorry.

959
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,120
I'm a thief!

960
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,120
Ah!

961
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,120
Do you want to die?

962
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,120
You're still a thief!

963
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,120
You're still a thief!

964
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,120
Get him out of here!

965
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,120
Okay.

966
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,120
Hello, hello.

967
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,120
Hello, where's Boss Zhang Wei?

968
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,120
Boss Zhang Wei is drunk.

969
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,120
I'm his friend, Li Laowei.

970
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:06,120
I'm a car driver.

971
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:09,120
His wallet has been transferred to my car.

972
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,120
The ID card is all here.

973
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,120
I'm a thief.

974
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,120
I'm a thief.

975
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,120
I'm a thief.

976
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,120
I'm a thief.

977
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,120
I'm a thief.

978
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,120
I'm a thief.

979
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,120
I'm a thief.

980
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,120
I'm a thief.

981
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,120
Boss Zhang Wei's friend?

982
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,120
Yes, I'm Boss Zhang Wei's friend.

983
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,120
A car driver?

984
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,120
Yes, come on.

985
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,120
Sorry.

986
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,120
Boss Zhang Wei is fast.

987
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,120
I just took him out of the car.

988
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,120
I haven't seen him for a long time.

989
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,120
He's been in the car for a while.

990
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,120
He's drunk.

991
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,120
You just sent him to the police station.

992
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,120
I said he was drunk.

993
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,120
He was faster than me.

994
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,120
Did you send Boss Zhang Wei?

995
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,120
I did.

996
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,120
I didn't know where he was.

997
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,120
What does he look like?

998
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,120
He's your friend.

999
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,120
What does he look like?

1000
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,120
You don't know?

1001
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,120
I just want to ask you.

1002
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,120
I'm afraid you're wrong.

1003
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,120
He has a little hair.

1004
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:21,120
He's wearing a black suit.

1005
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:24,120
Besides, he's not your friend.

1006
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,120
You're wrong.

1007
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,120
How many people did you take in the car?

1008
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,120
You're talking about me.

1009
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,120
How much?

1010
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,120
There are two people in the car.

1011
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,120
How can you beat a Tian Lang official?

1012
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,120
You took 15.

1013
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,120
And your Zhang Wei must have been taken by my buyer.

1014
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,120
I'm afraid he's going to be killed.

1015
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,120
Tian!

1016
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,120
Where's your phone?

1017
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:55,120
Here.

1018
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,120
Where's the address?

1019
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,120
Who?

1020
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,120
Your blind date.

1021
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,120
Fan Cheng Zhang Wei.

1022
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:10,120
Where are you?

1023
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,120
What's wrong with you?

1024
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:25,120
Why are you blowing?

1025
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,120
Are you in the bathroom?

1026
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,120
No, I'm in the bathroom.

1027
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,120
Where's the bathroom?

1028
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,120
You're talking nonsense.

1029
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,120
Is it a three-story bathroom?

1030
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,120
No, I'm not.

1031
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,120
I'm just going to go to the bathroom.

1032
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,120
I'm going to the bathroom.

1033
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,120
I'm going to the bathroom.

1034
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,120
Are you in the bathroom?

1035
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,120
Yes.

1036
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,120
Are you crazy?

1037
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,120
Who else?

1038
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,120
It's your Mr. Zhao.

1039
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:15,120
It seems he's in the bathroom.

1040
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,120
What's wrong?

1041
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,120
How did you get caught?

1042
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,120
You don't know.

1043
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,120
Some people can beat themselves.

1044
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,120
You're calling the police?

1045
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,120
Don't worry.

1046
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,120
You're busy.

1047
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,120
You don't have to worry about me.

1048
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,120
From now on,

1049
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,120
you have to do it with me.

1050
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,120
I don't do anything illegal.

1051
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,120
Then I'll take your dog's life.

1052
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,120
Why do you want my dog's life?

1053
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,120
I mean your dog's life.

1054
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,120
Yes, my dog's life.

1055
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,120
What are you talking about?

1056
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,120
You don't have to tell me.

1057
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,120
I'm not going to tell you.

1058
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,120
I'm not going to tell you.

1059
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,120
I'm not going to tell you.

1060
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,120
You don't have to tell me.

1061
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,120
You don't have to tell me.

1062
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,120
I'm not going to tell you.

1063
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,120
Boss, it's clear now.

1064
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,120
Can you help me?

1065
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,120
Now we're going to the bathroom.

1066
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,120
You take that smell off and throw it out.

1067
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,120
If you can't throw it out,

1068
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,120
I'll kill you right away.

1069
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:33,120
Okay.

1070
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:35,120
Since you're a man with one dress,

1071
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:37,120
you should throw it out.

1072
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,120
Go.

1073
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,120
Go.

1074
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,120
Ready.

1075
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:45,120
Turn around.

1076
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,120
Put the brand on.

1077
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,120
Go and get it.

1078
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,120
Hurry up.

1079
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,120
You're still a fool.

1080
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,120
I've been with Boss for a long time.

1081
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,120
I'm not a fool.

1082
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:07,120
Boss, you're a fool.

1083
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,120
You're a fool.

1084
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,120
You're a fool.

1085
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,120
You're a fool.

1086
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:15,120
You're a fool.

1087
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,120
One, two, three.

1088
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,120
Go.

1089
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,120
You're a fool.

1090
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,120
Go.

1091
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,120
Go.

1092
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:27,120
Go.

1093
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:33,120
Go.

1094
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,120
Go.

1095
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,120
I'm here to return the money.

1096
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,120
Please be safe.

1097
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,240
Boss.

1098
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:38,120
I want to have a swimming pool

1099
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:41,120
I drink and drink and drink

1100
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:46,120
I'm not in the car, I'm not in the car

1101
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:52,120
I'm happy and happy, I'm happy and happy

1102
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:58,120
I'm drunk and drunk, let's drink together

1103
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:04,120
I like to drink water, I like to drink wine

1104
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:10,120
I'm happy and happy, I'm happy and happy

1105
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:17,120
I like to drink water, I like to drink wine

1106
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:23,120
I like to drink water, I like to drink wine

1107
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,120
I like to drink water

1108
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:29,120
Brother Zhang, are you satisfied?

1109
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,120
Please come in.

1110
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:07,120
Brother Zhang, I'll do it.

1111
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:10,120
Brother Zhang, I'll do it.

1112
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:35,120
I'm sorry, I'm not satisfied.

1113
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:38,120
You're welcome.

1114
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:53,120
Who else wants to see him? Come in.

1115
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:11,120
Brother Zhang, let's start.

1116
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:39,120
Brother Zhang, let's start.

1117
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,120
Brother Zhang, you think about it.

1118
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,120
I'm really working on this.

1119
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,120
You think about it.

1120
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:14,120
Brother Zhang, is it money? We can discuss it.

1121
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:17,120
This is not money.

1122
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:19,120
Brother Zhang, you still lack understanding of us.

1123
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,120
Do you have no confidence in our strength?

1124
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,120
I already know very well.

1125
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:25,120
What kind of person are you?

1126
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:28,120
Brother Zhang, you don't know.

1127
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,120
Brother Zhang, look.

1128
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:32,120
These are all the new toy guns in our company.

1129
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,120
Take them and study them.

1130
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,120
Why do I need them?

1131
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,120
Take them and take a look.

1132
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,120
I don't want them.

1133
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,120
Look, look.

1134
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:49,120
Which one?

1135
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:50,120
Look.

1136
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:55,120
The one that ran through the window came out with me.

1137
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:57,120
Is it the one that was taken away?

1138
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,120
Are you sure?

1139
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,120
I'm sure.

1140
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:02,120
If they come and push the bag,

1141
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:04,120
I'm sure they will be the ones to take it away.

1142
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,120
Look, look.

1143
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,120
Go.

1144
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,120
I'm afraid I'll hear it.

1145
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:33,120
The first thing I did after I got the money

1146
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:36,120
was to take the money and sell the gun.

1147
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:37,120
They have a lot of people.

1148
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,120
I don't dare to do it.

1149
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:39,120
I'm not going to go and get a gun.

1150
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,120
Do you have a son?

1151
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:42,120
And a fat knife.

1152
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,120
If you want to draw a picture,

1153
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,120
you can draw a picture of a horse.

1154
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,120
Son.

1155
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:56,120
Look, brother.

1156
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,120
This is your son.

1157
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,120
He is Jiang Yi Cheng.

1158
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:03,120
He is a real man.

1159
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:04,120
He doesn't need to be a man.

1160
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,120
He can be a man.

1161
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:06,120
I'm sorry.

1162
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:09,120
I'm sorry.

1163
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,120
You're helping us now.

1164
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:13,120
That's the money to keep the money.

1165
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,120
The money to keep the money?

1166
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,120
Yes, the money to keep the money.

1167
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,120
Brother Zhang.

1168
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:25,120
Brother Zhang.

1169
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:26,120
Brother Zhang.

1170
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,120
If you are willing to help us now,

1171
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:29,120
not only the company's shares,

1172
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:30,120
but also yours.

1173
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:32,120
Our son.

1174
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:35,120
He wants you to be his father.

1175
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,120
Is that okay?

1176
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:46,120
You two are really too much.

1177
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,120
Brother Zhang.

1178
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,120
Brother Zhang.

1179
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:50,120
Brother Zhang.

1180
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,120
Brother Zhang.

1181
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:57,120
Jiang Yi Cheng.

1182
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,120
You two are really too much.

1183
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,120
What did you eat?

1184
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,120
I was so noisy.

1185
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:08,120
I didn't eat for four minutes.

1186
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,120
I was so lazy.

1187
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,120
I ate a lot.

1188
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:18,120
You are so mean.

1189
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,120
You are a fool.

1190
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:20,120
You are a fool.

1191
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,120
Brother Zhang.

1192
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,120
Brother Zhang.

1193
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:33,120
Brother Zhang.

1194
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:34,120
Where did you get the money?

1195
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:36,120
I have the money.

1196
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:39,120
I got the money.

1197
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,120
I got the money.

1198
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:45,120
Are you okay?

1199
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,120
Brother Zhang.

1200
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,120
It's you.

1201
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,120
What's wrong with you?

1202
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:03,120
I...

1203
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,120
I didn't do anything to you.

1204
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,120
Did you steal it?

1205
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,120
Yes, I did.

1206
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,120
I'll give you some money.

1207
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:09,120
Wait for me.

1208
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,120
I'm sorry.

1209
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,120
Who told you to give it to me?

1210
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:16,120
Who else?

1211
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:18,120
The two of you are making fun of each other.

1212
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:22,120
You and that idiot are a team.

1213
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,120
I'm not a team.

1214
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,120
I told them to keep an eye on me.

1215
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:28,120
I'm going to break the bar.

1216
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,120
Who is that?

1217
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,120
It must be his secretary.

1218
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,120
It doesn't look like he's a good guy.

1219
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,120
I have to run.

1220
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:44,120
Go.

1221
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:47,120
Go.

1222
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:50,120
I'm going to run.

1223
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:52,120
I'm going to run.

1224
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,120
Brother Zhang, you changed your mind.

1225
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,120
Brother Zhang.

1226
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,120
Brother Zhang.

1227
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,120
I'm going to run.

1228
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,120
You're a good guy.

1229
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:15,120
Have you checked the body?

1230
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:18,120
I...

1231
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,120
I'm sorry.

1232
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:23,120
I'm sorry.

1233
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:35,120
This is...

1234
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:37,120
I won't take this money.

1235
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,120
Let's go.

1236
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:47,120
Brother Zhang, you haven't signed the contract yet.

1237
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,120
What contract?

1238
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:49,120
Don't you want the shares?

1239
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,120
I don't even believe in anything.

1240
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:53,120
Then let me do this.

1241
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:57,120
Get out.

1242
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:01,120
Brother Zhang is so kind.

1243
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:02,120
He's a good guy.

1244
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:05,120
How can he be a angel?

1245
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:06,120
He's so handsome.

1246
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,120
Hey.

1247
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,120
I'm out of money.

1248
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:13,120
Can you help me get a car?

1249
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:15,120
I'm sorry.

1250
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:16,120
I'll arrange a car for you.

1251
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:18,120
You can rest in the room.

1252
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,120
Don't worry.

1253
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,120
Let him pick me up at the bridge.

1254
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,120
It's him.

1255
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,120
He's in the same car as me.

1256
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,120
No wonder he's a liar.

1257
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:31,120
That white-colored jacket

1258
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,120
is your blind date.

1259
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,120
Zhang Wei.

1260
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,120
It's him.

1261
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,120
He's a liar.

1262
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:48,120
He's a liar.

1263
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,120
Why did you let him go?

1264
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,120
You're not a professional.

1265
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:12,120
You're always on the line.

1266
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:13,120
Remember.

1267
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,120
You're a public figure.

1268
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,120
Master.

1269
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,120
What's your name?

1270
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,120
Lili.

1271
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,120
I'm not a rich man.

1272
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,120
I'm not rich.

1273
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:39,120
But I'm rich.

1274
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:40,120
Jin.

1275
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:41,120
You're so great.

1276
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,120
Hello.

1277
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,120
I'm here to deliver the gun.

1278
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:51,120
Deliver the gun?

1279
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:55,120
It must be the top quality product

1280
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,120
I ordered before.

1281
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,120
Come on.

1282
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,120
Come on.

1283
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,120
So cheap.

1284
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,120
Yes.

1285
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,120
It was 75 yuan.

1286
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:13,120
I'm happy today.

1287
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:15,120
The 25 yuan is a lot.

1288
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,120
Go.

1289
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,120
Lili.

1290
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:29,120
I have a big discovery.

1291
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,120
I'm not a rich man.

1292
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:34,120
I'm a rich man.

1293
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:38,120
The packaging is so creative.

1294
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:40,120
We have to improve the quality.

1295
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,120
The gun is too heavy.

1296
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:48,120
What's the gun?

1297
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,120
The gun is a water gun.

1298
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,120
I know.

1299
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,120
The gun is a water gun.

1300
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:56,120
I'll go back and leave.

1301
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,120
The gun.

1302
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,120
You're a lawyer.

1303
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,120
You're a lawyer.

1304
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,120
My phone.

1305
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,120
Forget it.

1306
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:09,120
It's free.

1307
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:14,120
You're a rich man.

1308
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:15,120
If it weren't for you,

1309
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,120
I would have been in trouble.

1310
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,120
I told you.

1311
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,120
They're too many.

1312
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,120
I'm afraid it's too much.

1313
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,120
Forget it.

1314
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:25,120
Forget it.

1315
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,120
You forgot the gun.

1316
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,120
It's too much.

1317
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,120
It's too much.

1318
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:33,120
Forget it.

1319
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:38,120
Da Gu, the flyer is out.

1320
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,120
What's the matter?

1321
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,120
The gun.

1322
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:42,120
Get up.

1323
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:44,120
Da Gu, don't be so sad.

1324
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:46,120
You're a robber.

1325
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,120
I've been making flyers for you.

1326
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:50,120
I've been making you sick.

1327
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,120
Tell me.

1328
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,120
What?

1329
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,120
What?

1330
01:11:58,120 --> 01:11:59,120
What?

1331
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,120
What?

1332
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,120
He's a robber.

1333
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,120
He's a robber.

1334
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:10,120
He's a robber.

1335
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:12,120
He's a robber.

1336
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,120
What?

1337
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:20,120
What?

1338
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:25,120
Back then, we had a hundred-and-eight.

1339
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,120
We were taught to be a robber.

1340
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:29,120
We were all killed.

1341
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,120
Get that bastard out of here.

1342
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:36,120
You're not getting back.

1343
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:41,120
I'm sorry.

1344
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:44,120
We must get the gun back today.

1345
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:45,120
Yes.

1346
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,120
Come on.

1347
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:49,120
Take this woman out of here.

1348
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,120
Brothers,

1349
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:51,120
please get out of here.

1350
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,120
Please help me.

1351
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,120
Da Gu,

1352
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:58,120
please get out of here.

1353
01:12:58,120 --> 01:12:59,120
What are you doing?

1354
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:00,120
What are you doing?

1355
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,120
You're a robber.

1356
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,120
You're a robber.

1357
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,120
You're a robber.

1358
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:06,120
You're a robber.

1359
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,120
You're a robber.

1360
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:10,120
You're a robber.

1361
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,120
Get that bastard out of here.

1362
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:28,120
One hundred?

1363
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:31,120
There's twenty-five yuan left.

1364
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:37,120
They're too much.

1365
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,120
They're bullying you.

1366
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,120
They're bullying you.

1367
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,120
You're a robber.

1368
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,120
You're a robber.

1369
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,120
You're a robber.

1370
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:27,120
You're free.

1371
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:31,120
You're free.

1372
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,120
I'm free, too.

1373
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,120
Little Bu.

1374
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:57,120
Where are you?

1375
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,120
My favorite master.

1376
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:00,120
Please open the automatic driving.

1377
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:09,120
Sorry, master.

1378
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,120
The automatic driving is here.

1379
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,120
Please switch to manual driving mode.

1380
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,120
This is real leather.

1381
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,120
Get out of here!

1382
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:40,120
Who are you looking for?

1383
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,120
I'm looking for a husband.

1384
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,120
There are rules.

1385
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,120
You always make mistakes.

1386
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:49,120
What's the matter?

1387
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,120
A woman?

1388
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:53,120
Yes.

1389
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,120
He said it.

1390
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,120
Excuse me.

1391
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:01,120
Is Zhang Wei a robber?

1392
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,120
He's our shareholder.

1393
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,120
I don't care.

1394
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,120
I'm a lawyer.

1395
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:08,120
I'm a robber.

1396
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:10,120
I'm a robber.

1397
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:12,120
We're the robbers.

1398
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:14,120
We're the robbers.

1399
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:16,120
Where's the robber?

1400
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:18,120
The robber.

1401
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:22,120
The robber.

1402
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:24,120
I think it's the owner's problem.

1403
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,120
Please give them a chance.

1404
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:30,120
If you don't like this,

1405
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,120
I'll give you a new water gun.

1406
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:33,120
Is it good?

1407
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,120
You're a robber.

1408
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:38,120
You're a robber.

1409
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:40,120
We're the robbers.

1410
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:42,120
Robbers.

1411
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:54,120
This is real.

1412
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:56,120
This is real.

1413
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:10,120
You're too dangerous.

1414
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,120
You two,

1415
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:14,120
let's see this.

1416
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:16,120
Let's go.

1417
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:25,120
We are not supposed to hit you.

1418
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,120
I got a new water gun.

1419
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,120
Where is the water gun?

1420
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,120
I don't know.

1421
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:51,120
Where is the water gun?

1422
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:06,120
We're not supposed to hit you.

1423
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:12,120
One is one, two is two.

1424
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:21,120
Who is he?

1425
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,120
I don't know.

1426
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,120
This is not a hotel.

1427
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:53,120
Boss, the robber is gone.

1428
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,120
The woman is gone too.

1429
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,120
She's on the way to the capital.

1430
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:59,120
Yes.

1431
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:16,120
I'll pick you up and go back.

1432
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:19,120
I'm coming.

1433
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,120
I'll go back as soon as I get there.

1434
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:25,120
Be careful.

1435
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:29,120
Don't run away.

1436
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,120
I'm coming.

1437
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:40,120
I'll go back.

1438
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:42,120
Come on.

1439
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:45,120
You're so dangerous.

1440
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,120
Come with me.

1441
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,120
Boss,

1442
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:26,120
you're so dangerous.

1443
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:27,120
Boss,

1444
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,120
what's the water gun?

1445
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:30,120
It's...

1446
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:32,120
It's 300.

1447
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:33,120
Boss,

1448
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,120
you're so dangerous.

1449
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,120
Boss,

1450
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:00,120
are you all right?

1451
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:02,120
I'm fine.

1452
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:10,120
The rain is pouring.

1453
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:12,120
Get down.

1454
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:28,120
Where are you?

1455
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:30,120
I'm here.

1456
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:32,120
I'll go back.

1457
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:39,120
Is he here?

1458
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,120
No, he's not.

1459
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,120
Come on.

1460
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:45,120
Hurry up.

1461
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,120
The robber is back.

1462
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,120
Boss,

1463
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,120
there's a strange creature.

1464
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:55,120
It's not here.

1465
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,120
What's going on?

1466
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:02,120
It's here.

1467
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:20,120
Boss,

1468
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:22,120
do you want to go fishing?

1469
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,120
They're not here.

1470
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,120
Hey.

1471
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,120
That's a long river tunnel.

1472
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:48,120
What the hell spent here?

1473
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:51,120
A big thing is,

1474
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:54,120
it's a flat field,

1475
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:56,120
right here.

1476
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:57,320
Right,

1477
01:22:57,320 --> 01:23:00,080
Your bike, if you have any problems,

1478
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:03,060
come to our western bus station first.

1479
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:04,680
I'll spare...

1480
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:41,400
Video

1481
01:23:57,320 --> 01:24:01,940
You dare murder?

1482
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,080
Give it to me!

1483
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:20,580
Who?

1484
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:26,060
A לט &ова

1485
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:27,460
WHAT THE versucht

1486
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:40,980
penalty

1487
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:46,260
allowing an enemy to fight

1488
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:49,920
I'll kill you all!

1489
01:24:54,420 --> 01:24:56,400
Don't get in my way!

1490
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:58,380
You'll all die again!

1491
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:18,260
Oh, you...

1492
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:20,260
Oh!

1493
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:26,260
Hehehehe!

1494
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:34,260
Hey!

1495
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:36,260
Hey!

1496
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:46,260
Hey!

1497
01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:50,260
Come on!

1498
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:52,260
Come on!

1499
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:54,260
I'm not going!

1500
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:56,260
I'm not going!

1501
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:04,260
Hey!

1502
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:06,260
I'm not going!

1503
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:22,260
Here we go!

1504
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:26,260
Hey!

1505
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:28,260
Hey!

1506
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:34,260
Hey!

1507
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:36,260
Hey!

1508
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:44,260
Look at this skill!

1509
01:26:44,260 --> 01:26:46,260
Look at this skill!

1510
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:48,260
You said you don't know what to do.

1511
01:26:48,260 --> 01:26:50,260
You want to teach Zhang Wei!

1512
01:26:50,260 --> 01:26:52,260
You ruined my good business!

1513
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:54,260
Yes!

1514
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:56,260
What's wrong with my Zhang Wei?

1515
01:26:56,260 --> 01:26:58,260
What's wrong with my Zhang Wei?

1516
01:26:58,260 --> 01:27:00,260
What's the chance?

1517
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:04,260
You're still drinking?

1518
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:06,260

You said that you would not sell the gun for illegal selling.

1602
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:57,700
Please go back and investigate.

1603
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:02,700
This kind of gun is too powerful.

1604
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:04,700
It can exceed 1.8 joules.

1605
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:05,700
That's illegal.

1606
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:08,700
Do you regret it?

1607
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:10,700
I must regret it.

01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:18,700
Boss, this is the picture of the gun on the Internet.

1610
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:20,700
It looks like you.

1611
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:21,700
That's me!

1612
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:23,700
I'm home!

1613
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:24,700
So sorry.

1614
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:25,700
Sorry.

1615
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:28,700
Please come in, Ten Sir.

1616
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:29,700
I'm sorry.

1617
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:30,700
Because of you...

1618
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:31,700
I didn't mean it.

1619
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:32,700
I fell.

1620
01:32:32,700 --> 01:32:35,700
You worked for me,

1621
01:32:35,700 --> 01:32:37,700
and then I was here to see you.

1622
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:47,700
Hello, director?

1623
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:51,700
Hello, keep up the good work.

1624
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:53,700
You can't buy it from the store.

1625
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:55,700
If you want to buy it from the store, you can't buy it from the market.

1626
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:56,700
Yes, yes, yes.

1627
01:32:56,700 --> 01:32:57,700
I'm a mother.

1628
01:32:57,700 --> 01:32:58,700
I'm a father.

1629
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:03,700
I want to eat the three-pronged pork.

1630
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:06,700
What do you mean by three-pronged pork?

1631
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:08,700
I said three-pronged pork.

1632
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:12,700
I mean, you should eat the three-pronged pork.

1633
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:16,700
I told you that the three-pronged pork is a good thing.

1634
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:18,700
You should do it like this.

1635
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:20,700
Okay, I'll do it first.

1636
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:23,700
You can't do it if you can't do it.

1637
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:24,700
Do it quickly.

1638
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:25,700
Okay.

1639
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:26,700
Okay.

1640
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:50,700
I'm a mother.
