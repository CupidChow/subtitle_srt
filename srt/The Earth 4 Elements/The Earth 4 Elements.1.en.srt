5
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,100
Mr. Wasupol from Nabanan vineyard is here to see you, sir.

6
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,660
I’m here to discuss about a marriage between Rose and my son, Wasu.

7
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,700
They have been friends since little. And our farms are right next to each other.

8
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,860
It’d be perfect if we become a family.

9
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,660
About this, I’d rather have Rose decide it herself.

10
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,930
So, you’re not going to keep our parents’ promise?

11
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,200
I don’t want to use that to force our children to do something against their own wills.

12
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,100
Let’s not be on bad terms just because one can’t keep a promise.

13
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,130
You know I’m quite respectable in the society.

14
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,060
If Rose agrees to marry my son, she won’t have to worry about anything for the rest of her life.

15
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,360
I’m sorry, Wasupol.

16
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,260
But no matter how hard you try,

17
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,760
my answer is still the same.

18
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,960
Did you get any evidence?

19
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,160
Here, sir.

20
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,530
It’s a picture of Mr. Wasupol moving the girls across the river to have them delivered at the border.

21
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:44,180
Wasupol is incredibly powerful. We must be very careful.

22
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,980
We should also find the police we could trust.

23
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,400
Yes, sir.

24
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,900
Din, listen carefully. I’m investigating on something very dangerous.

25
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,160
Is it about Mr. Wasupol’s illegal business?

26
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,330
Yes, they’re trafficking human to our neighbour country.

27
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,060
He wants his son to marry Rose…

28
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,780
because he wants to use the land by the river on Chomchan farm…

29
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,020
as a route for smuggling people across the border.

30
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,060
Let me help you, Uncle.

31
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,420
Mr. Wasupol is too powerful for you to handle this alone.

32
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,200
Where are you now, Uncle?

33
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,340
I’m going to the police station.

34
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,100
This matter is too dangerous. You should stay out of it.

35
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:46,860
I don’t trust anyone but you, Din.

36
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,980
If something ever happens to me, please look after Rose for me.

37
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:56,159
And never let her marry Wasu.

38
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,460
Promise me…that you will not abandon her.

39
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,580
Yes, I will take care of her.

I made you a sandwich, darling.

63
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:58,940
Thank you very much.

64
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,660
- I love you.
- I love you too.

65
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,660
Thanks again.

00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,100
Have some sandwich, dear.

67
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,580
Thank you.

68
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,340
Will you go back to Thailand to see your father this year?

69
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:18,180
I think so. But I’m going to take you with me too, Aunt Laura.

70
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,580
In case you love it and might want to settle down there.

71
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,780
I can’t dear. My home is here.

72
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:30,100
Besides, I don’t think your father would want you to go back anytime soon.

73
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,980
It’s quite odd. You’ve graduated for a while now.

74
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,060
But your father still doesn’t want you to go back to Thailand.

75
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,560
I think there must be something going on.

76
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,160
I wonder too.

77
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,020
Oh!

78
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,100
Does it hurt?

79
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,760
Just a little.

80
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,160
It’s all right. I’ll get the first-aid kit and fix your wound.

[Daddy]

82
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,500
Hi, Dad. Why are you calling so late today?

83
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,360
What?

84
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,560
Dad is in ICU?

Moddang.

87
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,900
I miss you so much, Miss.

88
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,730
How’s Dad?

89
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:06,700
The doctor said he has a brain swelling and needs a surgery to drain the blood clot from the brain.

90
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,800
The surgery is done now.

91
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,160
But the doctor still can’t say when he will gain consciousness.

92
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,360
And even if he finally wakes up,

93
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,760
the doctor can’t say for certain if he’d be all right.

94
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,860
Also…

95
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,420
What else did the doctor say?

96
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,960
The doctor said we should also be prepared for the worst.

97
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,260
Daddy…

98
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,460
I’m here, Dad.

99
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,530
Why do you want me to live so far away, Daddy?

100
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,530
Because that place is your mother's hometown.

101
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,700
Your aunt, Laura, also lives there.

102
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,420
Your mother will also go with you. What are you so afraid of, sweetie?

103
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,660
But you won’t be there, Daddy.

104
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:15,100
I have to look after this farm for you.

105
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:22,460
When you finish studying, you can come back and help me taking care of our farm.

106
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,460
You have to go visit me every school break.

107
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:35,930
Sure. Once you graduate, the three of us will come home and live here together.

108
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,020
Yes, Daddy.

109
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:45,700
Good girl. You’re the loveliest daughter, my baby.

110
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,260
Mum already left me.

111
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,300
Please don’t leave me too, Dad.

112
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,100
You have to be all right.

113
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,330
Please go rest at the farm first, Miss Rose.

114
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,760
I’ve already prepared the room for you.

115
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,980
I want to make sure he’s okay first.

116
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,460
Please don’t be stubborn, Miss. You’ve just arrived from a long flight.

117
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,540
I’ll take care of it here.

118
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,500
If anything happens, I’ll call you right away.

119
00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:01,130
I’ll stop by at the police station then. I want to find out more about the accident.

120
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,600
I want to know what actually happened to Dad.

121
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,580
You can ask Miss Din about that. She was at the police station today.

122
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:12,930
Din?

123
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:19,660
Miss Din from Saen Rak farm. You used to play with her when you were little.

124
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,420
Rose.

125
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,260
You don’t remember me?

126
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,700
He’s Mr. Wasu, the son of Mr. Wasupol—owner of Nubanun vineyard, the one next to our farm.

127
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:46,780
It’s me, your big brother Wasu. We often played together when we were little.

128
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,730
Oh, Wasu.

129
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:00,660
It’s been a long time. How have you been, living over there?

130
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,740
I’m good.

131
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,099
Are you coming back here for good?

132
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,530
I haven’t thought about that yet.

133
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,460
I’m really sorry about your dad.

134
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,180
But please don’t worry. My dad is pulling all his strings to get the best doctor for Uncle.

135
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,960
Our families are very close.

136
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:24,940
Uncle Thip is like a relative to me. I’ll do whatever I can to help him.

137
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,980
Thank you.

138
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,060
From now on, I’ll take care of you, Rose.

139
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,900
That’s all right. I’d rather not bother you.

140
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,130
Not a bother at all. It’s not like we’re strangers.

141
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,330
Did you come here straight from the airport?

142
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,000
Yes.

143
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,930
Let me drop you home then.

144
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,020
That’s okay. I don’t want to bother.

145
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,730
Not a bother at all. I have to pass by your farm on my way home anyway.

146
00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:01,560
Besides, before the accident, Uncle Thip also told me to look after you for him.

147
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,660
He did?

148
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,260
Aren’t we there yet?

149
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,730
We’re almost there.

150
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,560
But I don’t think this is a way to my farm.

151
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,540
It’s a short cut. You can go this way too.

152
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,800
You probably don’t know because you have been away for so long.

153
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,130
Are you all right, Rose?

154
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,000
Din!

155
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,200
Open it!

156
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,760
Open it!

157
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,800
Open the door!

158
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,180
Open it!

159
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,100
Open the goddamn door!

160
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,930
Let’s get out and talk to her.

161
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,800
Come with me, Rose.

162
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,460
Where are you taking her?

163
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,860
And where you’re taking her?

164
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,130
I’m taking her home.

165
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,020
Are you sure this is a way to her home?

166
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:27,800
I just want her to take a look around. It’s been a while since she last came back here.

167
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,740
But I don’t want that.

168
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,580
Just go back to your farm. If you don’t want to get into trouble,

169
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,060
you’d better leave us alone. Let her go.

170
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,220
No.

171
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,500
Try me if you dare.

172
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,900
So what? Uncle Thip told me to look after Rose. I’m not gonna let her go.

173
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,260
Let her go!

174
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,300
No!

175
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,140
That’s enough!

176
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,660
It’s been how many years already. Why are you two still fighting like a kid?

177
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,020
Pull the trigger then. Do it!

178
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,130
Why not?

179
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,940
It’s because you’re here, Rose. I’ll let her go today.

180
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,180
Let’s get in the car. I’ll drop you off.

181
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:47,420
Thank you, but I want to go by myself.

182
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,330
Come with me, Rose.

183
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,400
Rose!

184
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,380
Get in the car.

185
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,400
Din!

186
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,380
Ouch!

187
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,540
Rose!

188
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,620
It’s okay. Please don’t cry.

189
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,130
It hurts, Din.

190
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,700
Let’s go then. I’ll fix the wound for you.

191
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,740
Move! I’ll take care of her.

192
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,500
Get on my back, Rose. I’ll carry you home.

193
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:09,930
Wasu.

194
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:15,420
I’m not going to let you get hurt like what that brat did to you.

195
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,460
Din didn’t hurt me. I just tripped and fell.

196
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,900
What’s wrong, Din?

197
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:07,560
I’m sad because I’m not strong enough to carry you.

198
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:14,780
You might not be as big as Wasu, but you’re the kindest person in the world.

199
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:21,820
One day, I’ll become strong enough to protect you. I promise.

200
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,560
You promise!

201
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,980
Why are you staring at me?

202
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,740
Well, uh…

203
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,500
Don’t I look the same as when I was a kid?

204
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,140
You still look the same. But your personality has changed a lot.

205
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,960
How?

206
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,060
You weren’t someone who would stand up against Wasu like that.

207
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,100
Well, people change especially when they grow up.

208
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:16,780
I was only 10 when I moved to America. We haven’t seen each other for…

209
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,180
14 years.

210
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,930
How did you know it was me?

211
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:29,420
Uncle Thip loves to show me pictures of you. I’ll always recognize you anywhere.

212
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,300
Rose!

213
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,180
What are you doing?

214
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,660
I’m sorry.

215
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,020
It might hurt a little.

216
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,260
Sorry.

217
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,100
It should get better soon.

218
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,330
Let me do it then.

219
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:51,500
Moddang told me you went to the police station earlier. Is there any update on the case?

220
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,930
The police concluded it as an accident.

221
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,140
They told me that according to evidence found on the scene,

222
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,260
it’s possible that the driver was reckless.

223
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,500
But I don’t believe it.

224
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:14,000
Why? Why don’t you believe it?

225
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,420
I find it really odd.

226
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:20,660
The memory card in the dash cam is missing.

227
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,000
Has someone stolen it?

228
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:29,940
I’m not sure too. When I arrived at the scene, I was too shocked to notice anything.

229
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:34,820
The card might have gone missing before…or after that.

230
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,660
So, when his car crashed, you were also there?

231
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:45,860
Yes, I was the first one to get there. I was the one who called for the ambulance,

232
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,780
reported it to the police, and went to make a statement at the station.

233
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,860
Do you find anyone suspicious in particular?

234
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:01,220
I can’t accuse anyone without evidence.

235
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:06,900
But just before the accident, Uncle Thip called me.

236
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:13,420
He told me Mr. Wasupol wanted to propose a marriage for you and Wasu.

237
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,620
But Uncle Thip turned him down.

238
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,730
I’ve never known about this before.

239
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,060
Uncle Thip was looking into something very important.

240
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:27,660
He told me that if something ever happened to him,

241
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,930
I should look after you for him.

242
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,960
What?

243
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,860
Just temporarily. Until Uncle finally gains consciousness.

244
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:43,460
I want you to give it some thought. Come and tell me when you have an answer.

245
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:49,860
Okay.

246
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:18,560
Sweetie, do you know that all of this will be yours one day?

247
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:23,620
It’s so big, I can’t look after it.

248
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,540
I’m also a girl. I won’t be able to fight with anyone.

249
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:38,060
Do you know why I’ve named you ‘Rose’?

250
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:47,300
Roses might look pretty and fragile, but they are full of thorns.

251
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:53,460
Thorns to protect themselves from those who want to hurt them.

252
00:32:53,460 --> 00:33:01,860
I also believe that my daughter will surely grow up to be the strongest rose there is.

253
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:07,100
Yes, I’ll be strong and protect myself like roses do.

254
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,260
I’ll be strong and look after this farm for you, Dad.

255
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,330
Miss Rose! Miss Rose!

256
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,340
What happened? Miss Din just called and told me to hurry back here to stay with you.

257
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,960
Hasn’t she told you what happened?

258
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,760
Miss Din and Mr. Wasu pointed a gun at each other in the middle of the road?

259
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,700
I was shocked too.

260
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:55,500
Are they still not on good terms and always fight like when they were young?

261
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:00,980
Sort of. The lands on Nubanun vineyard, Saen Rak farm, and our farm are connected somehow.

262
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,620
It’s normal if that’d cause conflicts and arguments sometimes.

263
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,200
Well, not sometimes actually. Rather quite often.

264
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:12,900
Workers on Miss Din’s farm and Mr. Wasu’s farm often fought.

265
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,100
Can you tell me more about those two? Tell me everything.

266
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,699
You mean Miss Din and Mr. Wasu?

267
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:21,500
Yes.

268
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,600
Well, they are both good-looking.

269
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:28,860
Moddang. Their personalities, not their looks.

270
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,100
Oh, they are a complete opposite.

271
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:38,900
Miss Din is very private. She prefers to live in solitude and hardly mingles with anyone.

272
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:44,820
As for Mr. Wasu, he loves attention. He’s like the boss around here.

273
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:50,739
Mainly because Mr. Wasupol is the president of Chiang Rai entrepreneurs or something like that.

274
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:55,900
So, many people here respect him. They hardly disagree with him.

275
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,660
Hello. Hello.

276
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,600
How are you doing?

277
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,740
Hello, Mr. Wasupol.

278
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,620
Are you feeling better now?

279
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,700
Yes, I’m fine now. No more fever.

280
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,130
If you need anything, please let me know.

281
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,560
Thank you so much.

282
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,960
No problem.

283
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,900
This is my granddaughter.

284
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,460
She grows up so fast.

285
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,580
Say hi to Mr. Wasupol, dear.

286
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,700
Bless you. Oh, uh…

287
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,500
Keep this to buy yourself some snacks.

288
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,500
And this is for you, just in case.

289
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,460
You can use that money when you go see the doctor. And if it’s not enough, you can always tell me.

290
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,780
Yes, thank you very much.

291
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:39,180
Study hard, girl. Okay, I have to go now.

292
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,340
Mr. Wasupol is so kind everyone loves him. But he’s also very powerful.

293
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,980
Whatever he says, you must obey. No one dares to disagree with him.

294
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,340
He’s even got the sheriff and the village chief eating out of the palm of his hands.

295
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,780
What about our farm? Our land is also connected to Saen Rak farm and Nubanun vineyard,

296
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,020
has Dad every had a conflict with those two?

297
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,460
Not with Saen Rak farm.

298
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,020
Mr. Thipakorn and Miss Din are quite close.

299
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:34,020
Since her father passed away, Mr. Thip has always looked after her and cared for her.

300
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,930
When Miss Din took her father’s place to look after the farm,

301
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:57,700
it was also Mr. Thip who gave her advice on how to take care of the farm and how to come up with the production plan.

302
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,940
[Thipakorn: This will help increase the nutrients in vegetables.]

303
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,260
[Thipakorn: Once they start to grow and sprouting new leaves,]

304
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,940
[Thipakorn: you should start planting them in rows…1 2 3 4 5, like that.]

305
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,860
[Moddang]: When Miss Din encounters any problem, she’ll always come and talk to Mr. Thipakorn.

306
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,860
Hello, Uncle.

307
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,980
Oh, hello, Din. Have a seat, dear.

308
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,540
- What is it?
- I have something to discuss with you.

309
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:28,420
[Thipakorn: Old things are good. But I also have a new way.]
Or if Mr. Thip has any problem, Miss Din will always be there to give him a helping hand.

310
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,740
[Thipakorn: How about organic?]
- Miss Din respects Mr. Thip like he was her own uncle.

311
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,580
Mr. Thip also finds her very endearing.

312
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:40,940
After the accident, it’s Miss Din who has helped looking after of our farm.

313
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:47,180
Can we really trust her though? She doesn’t seem like the Din I used to know.

314
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,260
Sure, you can.

315
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,860
What about Nubanun vineyard? Is Dad close to them?

316
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:03,300
They are on good terms. They pay each other a visit from time to time.

317
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,300
Before the accident, Mr. Wasupol also came to see Mr. Thipakorn at our farm.

318
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,330
What did he want?

319
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:15,740
From what I had eavesdropped…I mean, overheard when walking pass by,

320
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:19,540
it was about a marriage between you and Mr. Wasu.

321
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,500
Din used to tell me about that too.

322
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:30,700
But if Dad really wants me to marry Wasu, why has he never mentioned it to me?

323
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,100
I think something is fishy here.

324
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:56,180
Thank you, sir. I’ll pay you back as soon as I can.

325
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,980
If it weren’t for you, I would’ve been in so much trouble.

326
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,540
Hey, don’t do that. You don’t have to pay me back.

327
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:06,620
We’re not strangers. If you ever need anything, you can always let me know.

328
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,980
Off you go then.

329
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,900
Thank you.

330
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:27,060
Did they come to ask for your money again? You surely are generous.

331
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,300
Let them have it.

332
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,760
Just throw them some scraps of money and they’ll come crawling at your feet like a dog.

333
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,660
Then, you can use them to do anything as you like.

334
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:42,900
Yes, Dad.

335
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:48,740
That’s right, I heard you went to the hospital.

336
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,940
So? Have you met Rose?

337
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,130
Yes, Dad. She’s…

338
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,800
exactly my type.

339
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:06,860
Does she seem to like you too? Is there a chance that our plan might work?

340
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,100
She seemed worried about Uncle Thip. I didn’t dare to be so obvious and make a move on her.

341
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:20,020
We’re running out of time. You have to make her fall for you as soon as you can.

342
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,420
It’s not that easy, Dad.

343
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:27,580
At first, I planned to buy myself some time while driving so that I could talk to Rose a bit longer.

344
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:31,060
But that rascal Din just got in the way.

345
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,780
She said Uncle Thip has asked her to look after Rose.

346
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,380
I don’t know if Rose will believe her or not.

347
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:42,660
Then tell Rose that you’re her fiancé, as both our families have agreed a long time ago.

348
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,000
Will she believe me though?

349
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:58,300
If I’m the one who says it, she’ll definitely believe me.

350
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:31,660
Kaew, you can leave first. I’ll stay a bit longer to get some work done.

351
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,200
Okay.

352
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,160
Do you have a lot on your mind lately, Miss Din?

353
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,500
Yeah, so many things to take care of.

354
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,700
Is it about Mr. Thipakorn?

355
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,930
Yes, I’m quite certain it’s not an accident.

356
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,160
But we don’t have any evidence. The dash cam is also missing.

357
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,560
I must find out the truth about this.

358
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:28,460
But during this time, I’ll have to go work at Chomchan farm for Uncle Thip.

359
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,900
Please take care of our farm for me, Kaew.

360
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:37,020
Don’t worry, Miss Din. Even though Miss Rose is back, I doubt she could hardly be of any help.

361
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,300
Thanks a lot, Kaew. You’ve made my work much easier.

362
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,530
But I’m afraid you’ll have to attend the meeting in Chiang Mai yourself.

363
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,160
Okay.

364
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,900
I’m heading out then.

365
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:17,220
Hey, Lom. I need to ask you a favour.

366
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,060
Have your men destroyed all the evidence?

367
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:36,420
Get our men ready. If nothing gets in the way, we’ll have a big job soon.

368
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,900
That old man has found out about everything.

369
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:49,100
If we leave him like that, wouldn’t we be in trouble if he finally wakes up?

370
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:57,020
If we make a move now, the cops will definitely know it wasn’t an accident.

371
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,100
It’s too risky.

372
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,540
Why isn’t he dead yet? So bloody lucky!

373
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,260
The day that he wakes up is the day he’ll die.

374
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:34,860
[Phone ringing]

375
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,260
Yes, Miss Din?

376
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,530
Moddang, how’s Rose doing? Is everything okay?

377
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,300
Yes, everything is fine.

378
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:48,940
Miss Rose has eaten, taken a shower, and gone to bed early tonight.

379
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,800
Have you noticed anything unusual?

380
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:53,140
Not at all.

381
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:57,940
Before you go to bed, make sure all doors and windows are locked.

382
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:02,500
If you see anything suspicious, you can call me anytime, okay?

383
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:09,300
Yes, Miss. If you’re so worried, why don’t you just move in and live with us?

384
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:19,160
Please don’t worry, I’ll patrol the place and do the rounds every hour.

385
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:22,730
Thank you.

386
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:24,940
You’re welcome.

387
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:40,940
Geez, what a foul mouth. I’d better go check again.

388
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:11,340
[Bottles clinking]

389
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,220
Oh my goodness! Ghost! Ghost! Ghost!

390
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:35,900
I’ve never had a boyfriend yet.

391
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,580
Please don’t hurt me. I’m scared now!

392
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:39,500
It’s me, Moddang!

393
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,600
Oh, Miss Rose? You gave me a fright!

394
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:48,930
I couldn’t sleep, so I came down to find something to eat. Probably because of a jetlag.

395
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,100
Why didn’t you turn on the light? Why acting so stealthily?

396
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:57,780
Actually, you should’ve told me. I could bring it up to your room.

397
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:04,380
It’s all right. But why is the fridge full of all the things that I like to eat?

398
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,620
Hmm, I didn’t buy them though.

399
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:14,100
When Miss Din knew that you’d come back, she got everything prepared for you.

400
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:18,300
That cake you’re about to eat, Miss Din also bought it.

401
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:23,420
Why is she so nice to me? Is there a poison in here?

402
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:26,500
Of course not. Trust me.

403
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,940
Miss Din is so good-looking. She must be a good person.

404
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:36,730
Is there anything else you need, Miss Rose?

405
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:44,420
Mmm…Oh! Where’s that keepsake box I owned when I was a kid? I couldn’t find it in my room.

406
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,580
Hmm…Oh! I think it’s in the storage room.

407
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:50,140
I’ll get it for you.

408
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,360
Okay.

409
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:16,580
I haven’t been here for a long time. I just want to recall some of the old memories a bit.

410
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:22,060
But they’re so dusty. Do you want me to clean them first?

411
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,700
Never mind.

412
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:34,300
Is it still here?

413
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,500
Dad really kept everything for me.

414
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:43,140
What kind of plushie is this? Look at those stitches. So ugly.

415
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:48,060
It’s from when I was a kid. Its arm got torn off.

416
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:51,940
I even tried to fix it with a tape, but I couldn’t.

417
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:56,930
In the end, it was Din who secretly fixed it for me. That’s why it looks like this.

418
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,300
Oh, Miss Din did those stitches?

419
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:02,900
Is it too late to take back my words?

420
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,540
I fixed it.

421
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,500
You’re the best!

422
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,730
What do you want to play today, Rose?

423
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,160
I want to play Prince&Princess.

424
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:25,460
But Wasu has already gone home. There are only princesses and no prince here.

425
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,660
Then you can be the prince for me.

426
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,700
But I’m a girl. How can a girl be a prince?

427
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:36,060
Why not? A girl can be a prince too.

428
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,300
You are absolutely cool!

429
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,340
I’m dressed up as a prince now. What’s next?

430
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:06,330
A prince must marry a princess.

431
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,600
Huh?

432
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:11,100
Prince, will you marry this princess from the land of rose?

433
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,980
What kind of princess propose to a prince?

434
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:16,460
Hmph! Din!

435
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:19,260
Yes, I will.

436
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,580
On your knee! On your knee!

437
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:29,340
May this represent the Rose princess.

438
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:35,220
If you accept my love, please keep this rose with you, Prince.

439
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:31,060
I’ll take care of you, Rose.
