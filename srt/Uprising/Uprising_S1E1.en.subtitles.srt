1
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,948
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED ON HISTORICAL EVENTS

2
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,545
The Joseon Dynasty scholar Jeong Yeo-rip

3
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:48,048
asserted that all people are equal,
and should have no master.

4
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,592
In a private community he formed
called Great Unity,

5
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:54,304
noblemen and slaves shared food and drink
and practiced martial arts together.

6
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,599
Eventually accused of treason,

7
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,100
he was besieged by government forces

8
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,269
and took his own life
by putting a knife through his neck.

9
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,855
This was under the reign of King Seonjo.

10
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,167
Tie them all up!

11
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:30,340
Both a king and a slave…

12
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,219
They are equal.

13
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,017
They are "equal"?

14
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,832
Did your father write this?

15
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,293
Answer me.

16
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,588
How can he, with his tongue cut off?

17
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:11,548
Hush.

18
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,967
Your father said this as well.

19
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,636
"The world belongs to all,

20
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,141
and anyone may become king."

21
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,519
Second State Councilor!

22
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:27,689
Do you believe a king and a slave

23
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,190
are truly equal?

24
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,942
Your Majesty!

25
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:35,029
Do not repeat the words of
that traitor on your royal lips!

26
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,866
He said even a butcher, courtesan or slave

27
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,493
could occupy the throne.

28
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,835
You sit there.

29
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,797
Of course, my royal robe.

30
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,926
-I'll give you this too.
-Your Majesty!

31
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,679
I beg you, Your Majesty!

32
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:02,056
We beg you, Your Majesty!

33
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,852
How could this happen?

34
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,610
Judge, what are you waiting for?

35
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:17,197
Cut the heads off the disgusting traitors…

36
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,619
OK-NAM,
SON OF REBEL LEADER JEONG YEO-RIP

37
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:33,963
Okay.

38
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,840
Let's go one more time!

39
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,807
-What a dummy.
-That idiot.

40
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,103
Give me another chance.

41
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,286
Runaway slave! Make way.

42
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,582
Look at this fool.
He dared to run away and got caught.

43
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,566
Look at that.

44
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,736
Just like someone else,
he stepped out of line

45
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,863
and ended up like that.

46
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,373
You scoundrel!

47
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,008
-What's happening?
-Look over there.

48
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,553
Such insolence!

49
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,930
This is Inspector-General Yi Deok-hyeong.

50
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,140
Show due respect!

51
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,274
-Let go!
-Hey, keep still!

52
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,152
In such close proximity to His Majesty,

53
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,487
must you raise such a ruckus?

54
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,698
Please forgive me for my impudence,
my lord.

55
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,701
I am Gwang-yi, a slave hunter.

56
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,537
To date, I have managed to capture

57
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,456
this many slaves.

58
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,042
This one here already ran away twice.

59
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,544
He is a rotten scoundrel.

60
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,087
RUNAWAY SLAVE

61
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:42,050
On top of that, this time
he even stole from his master.

62
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,429
This is our master's sword.

63
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,437
YI JONG-RYEO
BEST IN MILITARY ARTS

64
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,150
His mother was a slave

65
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,152
of the Deputy Minister of Defense.

66
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,445
12 YEARS AGO

67
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,200
JANGYEWON: SLAVE REGISTRY OFFICE

68
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,451
The One Parent Rule.

69
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,620
Are you familiar with this?

70
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,123
It says that if either parent is a slave,

71
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,501
their child is a slave too.

72
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,044
That is national law.

73
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,420
Case closed.

74
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,173
My wife and I were both commoners.

75
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,801
My wife was sold off
as we could not pay our debt,

76
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,554
but my son was conceived
before any of that happened.

77
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,973
A mother and her fetus are one,
are they not?

78
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:35,561
When a mother becomes a slave,
so does the child in her womb.

79
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,355
That is only right.

80
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:41,317
He was raised as a commoner.
But now suddenly he is a slave?

81
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,909
Give me that.

82
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,577
You little…

83
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,416
My father made that for me!

84
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,752
That little brat.

85
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:05,716
Now I'll tell you about the family
that will own you until you die,

86
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,677
so clean out your ears and listen.

87
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,221
I'm not curious.

88
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,599
You will be working for the family

89
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,561
of the esteemed
Deputy Minister of Defense.

90
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:20,481
For generations since King Taejo's reign,
the men in his family

91
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,942
have always passed
the national military exam.

92
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:26,529
They are the most influential
military family in Joseon.

93
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,490
Their mansion has more than 60 rooms

94
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:33,119
The family owns more than 100 noh-bi

95
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:37,331
"Noh" means male slave,
"bi" means female slave

96
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:41,127
They all have different tasks

97
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,590
The letter bearer delivers mail

98
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,009
The broomboy sweeps the yard

99
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,720
Cooks prepare side dishes

100
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:54,724
While steamers make the rice

101
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,976
Laundresses wash clothes

102
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,519
While water bearers work the well

103
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,105
The stoker builds fires

104
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,524
Shovelers clean the outhouse

105
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,860
The woodcutter cuts firewood

106
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:10,531
The stablehand feeds the horses

107
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,451
Empty the chamber pots, mop the floor

108
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,286
Iron the clothes, sew the stitches

109
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:18,831
Dress the young master
Give the madam a massage

110
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,292
Fan the master and wash his feet

111
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,378
So many slaves, so many jobs

112
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,716
Among all those tasks, know what yours is?

113
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,134
Whip him!

114
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,430
I'll be whipped in his stead?

115
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,431
Why?

116
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,724
Why do you ask the obvious?

117
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:39,393
As the young master's body servant,
you get whipped in his stead.

118
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,689
He cannot be scarred
for he will become a general.

119
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,366
It doesn't make sense.

120
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,283
Why not?

121
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,661
Why should I get whipped?
I did nothing wrong.

122
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,705
Shut it, will you?
You talk too much, you brat.

123
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,208
We are back, Master.

124
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,547
Bow to him, now!

125
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,343
How dare you?

126
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:14,887
You rascal.

127
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:20,977
Why, you little…

128
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,566
You brat!

129
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,359
What are you doing?

130
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,367
Get rid of this!

131
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,418
My son! Oh no…

132
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,794
Strong bones.

133
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,589
-What do we do?
-Strong limbs.

134
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,382
And he has straight teeth.

135
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,553
Let's go.

136
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,431
Is it this boy?

137
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,143
How long will this one last?

138
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,619
That poor boy.

139
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:23,789
How can I go on like this?

140
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,793
How could this happen?

141
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:31,297
Son, it's my fault you were born a slave.

142
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,967
It's all my fault.

143
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,345
Are they so heartless?

144
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,430
How many times has it been?

145
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,391
Brother, I will cover him now.

146
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:14,924
Your name is Cheon-yeong?

147
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,761
What does your name mean?

148
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,182
I guess you do not know.

149
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,144
This "Cheon" means "to follow,"

150
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,772
and this "Yeong" means "shadow."

151
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,109
You follow me like a shadow.

152
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,361
What do you say?

153
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,370
You still have your baby teeth.

154
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,373
Your shadow?

155
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,874
Me?

156
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,464
What are you doing?

157
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,519
Father!

158
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:12,648
Father!

159
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,520
Go away! I said, go away!

160
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,275
You brat.

161
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,614
Father!

162
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,407
Quiet, you.

163
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,285
This way!

164
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,375
Isn't that Cheon-yeong?

165
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,044
How many years has it been?

166
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,728
Are you that fond of me?

167
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,148
I leave, and you drag me back

168
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,734
every single time.

169
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,362
Just be quiet, please.

170
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:45,991
Young Master.

171
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,828
After failing the exam year after year,

172
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:51,872
how on earth did you not only pass

173
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,251
but place first in the country?

174
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,170
What is he talking about?

175
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,063
Kill me.

176
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,945
The servants are watching.

177
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,489
You must not take his life.

178
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:42,298
Worthless degenerate.
Lock him in the shed!

179
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,988
Just kill me!

180
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,327
Unless you want your whole family
to die at my hands.

181
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,079
Your father,

182
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,540
your mother,

183
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,792
your wife,

184
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,838
and your spawn too.

185
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,884
I'll throw every one of them
into a raging fire

186
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,510
and burn them alive.

187
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:42,816
Hold him down.

188
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,624
I can't let this go any longer.

189
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,816
Protect your head!

190
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:28,404
Hit up high, then left, jab,
down to the right,

191
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,738
up to the left…

192
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,503
From now on,
if I get hit once during the day,

193
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,463
I'll hit you twice at night.

194
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,549
Get into position.

195
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,802
Your teacher's moves are predictable.

196
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,930
If he starts here,
he'll target your right side

197
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,432
and follow with a jab.

198
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,183
If he starts lower--

199
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,019
A jab. Then the shoulders.

200
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,396
So you know.

201
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,316
Try it, then.

202
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:27,838
Duck to dodge it.

203
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:31,550
The other foot.

204
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,971
-Like this?
-Well done.

205
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,443
That's right.

206
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:24,478
Father told me to practice with you
from tomorrow.

207
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:35,114
So I won't get whipped anymore?

208
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,241
Yes.

209
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,367
I think so.

210
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:18,699
That's it!

211
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:22,786
Go for it!

212
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,882
Will you do this at the exam too?

213
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,717
There's no anger in your sword.

214
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,345
You need not worry.

215
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,931
Once I meet my real enemy,

216
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:47,728
my sword will hold anger too.

217
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:52,608
Confectionary!

218
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,693
Buy some good-luck confectionary!

219
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:55,903
MILITARY EXAMINATION OFFICE

220
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:59,448
One to pass, two for an award!

221
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,283
-Kim Yi-nam.
-Confectionary!

222
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,451
Yi Jong-ryeo.

223
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,204
-I'll go now.
-Yi Jong-ryeo.

224
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,375
Go on.

225
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,759
How many times have you failed the exam?

226
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,678
I'm ashamed. You shame me!

227
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,725
When I die, how will I face my ancestors?

228
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,396
Hey.

229
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,524
Please allow me

230
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,236
to take the exam on Young Master's behalf.

231
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,446
Have you lost your mind?

232
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,909
Just promise to liberate me.

233
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,869
Then I will pass the exam with top marks

234
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,788
and bring you the royal flowers
from the King.

235
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,293
I am Yi Jong-ryeo.

236
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,503
Kim Min-seok.

237
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,463
-Here.
-Yi Jong-won.

238
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,006
Here.

239
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:22,990
His Majesty has bestowed a sword
and this blue robe upon him.

240
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,702
The royal flowers suit you well.

241
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,371
Not even I placed first…

242
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:32,833
Cheon-yeong.

243
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,880
My goodness.

244
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,633
You truly are the rightful owner
of that blue robe.

245
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,521
Wait here.

246
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,982
I'll get your slave papers from Father.

247
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,984
While you wait, enjoy a glass of soju.

248
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,615
I was told not to give him
even a sip of water.

249
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,410
Anyone who disobeys the order
will end up like him.

250
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,453
Get out!

251
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,039
Back to work!

252
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,316
Dad.

253
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:43,403
Can a bird float in the air
without spreading its wings?

254
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,365
What is that thing? It looks like…

255
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,418
WAR

256
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:00,545
Young Master!

257
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,797
Hey, Kim.

258
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,757
-Is Mother still awake?
-Yes.

259
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,968
You say the king will abandon the capital?

260
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,763
I, too, must leave now
to escort His Majesty.

261
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,807
I sent a messenger to my uncle in Wonsan,

262
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,684
so leave quietly with Father
as soon as he returns from work.

263
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,278
Take good care of our son.

264
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,328
My sword is missing.

265
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,872
I'll find it. Make haste and leave.

266
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,834
I will be sure to send it to you.

267
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:43,880
Give me the key.

268
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:08,738
Busan Fortress fell not long ago.
But they have already reached Yongin?

269
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,157
Nonsense.

270
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:14,327
The renowned General Shin's army
got wiped out.

271
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,455
Why else
would we be getting ready to flee?

272
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,542
Damn. This is no ordinary war.

273
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:22,878
Oh, boy.

274
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,089
I know you have a thieving hand,

275
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,258
but how dare you
touch a gift from the King?

276
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,676
No excuses. Hand it over!

277
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,761
What are you talking about?

278
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:32,971
Look at you playing dumb!

279
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,141
-Where is the sword?
-I have no idea.

280
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,517
Tell me now!

281
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,019
Why are you asking him?

282
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,159
You, that sword…

283
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:58,914
Everyone take one.
How long must we be treated like pigs?

284
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,045
What is happening here?

285
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,464
Put it down this instant!

286
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,599
Where are the slave papers?

287
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,814
Why are you home so late, my lord?

288
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,541
This means you and I

289
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,209
are now equal.

290
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,843
Young Master.

291
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,346
No! No…

292
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,387
Where is the young master?

293
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:26,645
Where is your husband?

294
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,688
Back off, you brute!

295
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,067
Your curse is working.

296
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:35,862
Come here, my lady.

297
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,656
It is dangerous there.

298
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:38,740
Come here!

299
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,955
How dare you touch me
with those filthy hands?

300
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,335
Are you insane?

301
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,420
Come out, now!

302
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,541
Even the lanterns are failing us.

303
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,461
Everyone be careful.

304
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,340
Your Highness!

305
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,468
Punish us with death!

306
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,511
Is there no one who can help me?

307
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,679
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

308
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,515
This is why
she should have ridden a horse.

309
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,225
Are you all right, Your Highness?

310
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,602
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

311
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,398
What are they looking at?

312
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,400
What? What is the matter?

313
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,743
Has the Japanese army
already reached the capital?

314
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:49,704
They can't have crossed the Han River yet.

315
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,248
What? Then who did that?

316
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,251
-That is the palace, is it not?
-Well, yes…

317
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:01,007
I am asking who dared
to set Gyeongbokgung on fire.

318
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:01,925
Your Majesty.

319
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:06,262
Shamefully, the people in the city…

320
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:08,848
The people? My people?

321
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,394
But why?

322
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:22,529
The King abandoned the palace
and ran away!

323
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,742
The hell with it.
Just turn it all upside down.

324
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,917
These damned slave papers!

325
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,128
You think you can change
the world like this?

326
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,019
TRAITOR JEONG YEO-RIP

327
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:11,536
Look at it burn, burn it all down!

328
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:16,082
-How could this happen?
-Father, no!

329
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,430
Hooray!

330
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:38,062
I thought all the military officers fled.

331
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,373
The capital, finally.

332
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,543
Forward!

333
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,045
-Forward!
-Yes, sir!

334
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:13,222
All right, everyone. Gather around.

335
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,474
WEAPONS MANUFACTURING OFFICE

336
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:15,725
Come here.

337
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,936
I hear the Japanese invaders
have crossed the river.

338
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,562
It won't be long now.

339
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,397
Even the King has fled,

340
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:24,025
so we must defend ourselves.

341
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:27,153
Any idea as to how to pull that off?

342
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,280
Look here!

343
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,240
I have brought a military officer.

344
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,579
He's really an officer?

345
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:39,248
With that sword and robe, he must be.

346
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,050
A spear, sword, or bow!

347
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,885
If you can wield these, step forward.

348
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,392
Is that all? I see so many men here.

349
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,437
Listen, people.
Contribute to your country.

350
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:04,357
Commoners will be rewarded,
and slaves freed.

351
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,109
Those are the precedents.

352
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,069
Slaves will be freed?

353
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:11,406
Do not hesitate because of
your lowly status. Step forward.

354
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:13,700
Come on. Hurry.

355
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:14,826
Sir.

356
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,536
When it comes to stone throwing,

357
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:19,122
I'm the best north of the river.

358
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,290
My goodness. Has this fool lost his mind?

359
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,291
Do you want to die?

360
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,543
Look here.

361
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:26,212
Does a butchering knife count as a sword?

362
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,008
Mr. Butcher, come join them.

363
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,343
Who knew this lowly butcher
would be addressed

364
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,804
as "mister" by a nobleman?

365
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:37,849
-I'm in too.
-You fool!

366
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,475
All right. Come on out, all of you.

367
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,978
Let us try to find weapons in the arsenal.

368
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:45,148
-Yes, let us go!
-Let us go!

369
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,167
I am famished and have no energy.

370
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,130
Bring the platter.

371
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,673
Ready the boat.

372
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,133
Stand straight.

373
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,095
-Post guards to keep watch.
-Yes, sir.

374
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,811
Kill everyone!

375
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,951
How dare you!

376
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:40,703
-Let go!
-Get out!

377
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,414
-You witch!
-Fear the wrath of heaven!

378
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,459
What?

379
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:51,923
You scoundrel. You shall breathe your last

380
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:54,509
when the sword you are holding
pierces your throat.

381
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,052
What did she say?

382
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,763
She said your sword

383
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,181
will pierce your throat.

384
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,851
I will pierce my own throat?

385
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,855
I'll remember that.

386
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,361
So…

387
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,029
Like this?

388
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,665
Is that all?

389
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,089
I have never seen this fish before.

390
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,550
-Forgive us!
-Forgive us!

391
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,677
We combed through all the homes
in the area,

392
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,595
but this fish was all we could find.

393
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,515
What happened?

394
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:43,933
I see the King!

395
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:45,184
-Over there!
-There he is.

396
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,602
Who the hell are they?

397
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,360
How dare you!

398
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,028
You bled us dry,

399
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,321
yet you are the first to run?

400
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,115
You even stole the fish

401
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:02,243
we've been saving for the memorial rites?

402
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,494
Such insolence!

403
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,913
Do you have a death wish?
How dare you block the royal path?

404
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,665
The King flees on his royal path

405
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:10,626
while his people walk a path
straight to hell?

406
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,254
-Damn you!
-Is only the king's life important?

407
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,006
We too must live!

408
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,382
Escort His Majesty to the boat!

409
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,259
Let go!

410
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,599
-Your Majesty!
-Move!

411
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:25,766
How dare you!

412
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,440
Move away! We should go with you too!

413
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,525
Yi Jong-ryeo, what are you doing?

414
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,076
Move!

415
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,247
Why are you here?

416
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:51,000
I am so sorry to tell you
this tragic news,

417
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,086
but the slaves set your house on fire

418
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:55,922
and they all ran away.

419
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,048
Slaves?

420
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:58,883
My slaves? But why?

421
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,055
What about my family?

422
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:08,559
Where is my family?

423
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,773
When I arrived,

424
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,108
the fire had already taken them.

425
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:19,445
Even…

426
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,323
Even my son?

427
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,577
You bastards!

428
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,538
One more thing.

429
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,292
I saw Cheon-yeong
fleeing on a stolen horse,

430
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,628
clad in your blue robe.

431
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,652
You should be stoned to death!

432
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,912
Drag Cheon-yeong to me.

433
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,465
Kill every last one of them!

434
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,884
Are you all right, sir?

435
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,261
Where did that come from?

436
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,388
Target hit!

437
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,475
-Just one?
-What is that clown?

438
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:35,521
You piece of…

439
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:38,274
How ridiculous.

440
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,694
-You bastard!
-You rats!

441
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,407
Shields, forward!

442
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,080
It's a trap!

443
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,708
Get them!

444
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,045
No, not yet!

445
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,880
Hold formation!

446
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,298
Fire!

447
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,552
Second line, forward!

448
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,179
How reckless.

449
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,349
Have some rice balls.

450
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,487
Second line, forward!

451
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,992
Hurry up and load your muskets.

452
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,329
Attack when they reload!

453
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,498
Get ready.

454
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,167
Yes, sir.

455
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,251
Fire!

456
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,003
Change lines!

457
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,260
Ambush!

458
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,583
Aoki.

459
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:04,420
Break through the right side
with the cavalrymen.

460
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,088
Yes, sir.

461
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:15,181
Royal Guard Commander,
protect His Majesty!

462
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:17,933
There is the boat!

463
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,162
Damn you!

464
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,430
-Honda.
-Sir!

465
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,899
Your Majesty!

466
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,651
There is no time for bowing.

467
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:12,321
Make haste. Set sail. Quick.

468
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,037
Kill them.

469
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,290
Launch the boat. Now!

470
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,753
Please let us go with--

471
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,319
Identify yourself!

472
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:57,324
Step back, all of you.

473
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:06,125
I am Genshin Kikkawa,
Konishi Battalion's frontline commander.

474
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,544
State your rank and name.

475
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:11,463
This is Genshin Kikkawa,
Konishi Battalion's frontline commander.

476
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:12,965
You are to state your rank and name.

477
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:15,342
My rank is a dog,

478
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,552
His rank is dog.

479
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:17,469
and my name…

480
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:18,679
And his name is…

481
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,097
Tell him it's Bastard.

482
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,098
It's bastard.

483
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,403
"Yi Jong-ryeo"?

484
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:09,480
You are quite skilled
for a Joseon swordsman.

485
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,149
A skilled swordsman is a rarity in Joseon.

486
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:17,071
You are not so bad yourself.

487
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,489
He says you are quite skilled.

488
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,492
Losing strength already?

489
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:22,660
Are you tired already?

490
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,953
Just starving is all.

491
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,915
Give me some leftover rice balls.

492
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,124
He says he is hungry.

493
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,876
He wants some rice balls.

494
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:32,980
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

495
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,566
Once I disembark,

496
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,944
destroy the dock.

497
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:40,112
Your Majesty.

498
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:43,449
If we do so,
the people will have no means to evacuate.

499
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:45,909
You must also sink this boat.

500
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,413
I am concerned
the enemy might build rafts.

501
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,459
Set fire to the nearby houses

502
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,253
and burn them all down.

503
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:12,936
STRUGGLE

504
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:23,614
7 YEARS LATER

505
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:37,461
-Give it!
-I want some too!

506
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:38,712
No, it's mine!

507
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,881
What is that? Is it food?

508
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,966
It's a corpse. A dead body!

509
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,177
Cut off a leg for us, please?

510
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:57,272
It is I, Gwang-yi.

511
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:05,072
I caught two this time.

512
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:10,661
What about Cheon-yeong?

513
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,914
I will keep looking.

514
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:36,854
SUNCHEON BASE CAMP
OF THE RIGHTEOUS ARMY (VOLUNTEER MILITIA)

515
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,651
It was an honor to fight alongside you.

516
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:45,279
General Kim,
I wish you good health and longevity.

517
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:48,282
-Get up, please.
-Thank you, General.

518
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:51,493
Thanks to you, General,
we can go home safely.

519
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,370
I owe it all to you, lads.

520
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,163
Hey, Beom-dong.

521
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,499
Why the long face?

522
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,796
I am not sure it's okay
to let them go home like this.

523
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:06,967
Some remnants of the Japanese army
still roam freely, disguised as locals.

524
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:10,637
Now that the war is over,
let's not think about bloodshed

525
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,056
and figure out a way to get by.

526
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:17,644
Hurrah, how exciting

527
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:21,773
Just live and let live

528
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,692
Some get to return home.

529
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:26,653
Some stay behind to tidy up, shit!

530
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,449
Mr. Tactician!

531
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:32,784
Mr. Tactician!

532
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:35,579
I hope he brought good news.

533
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:36,580
You're back!

534
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:52,262
You see, I had a dream last night.

535
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:56,391
In my dream, the pond in the garden
looked three times bigger.

536
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:59,269
It looked quite nice.

537
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,566
The brush.

538
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:12,991
I wish to build a larger pavilion here.

539
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:15,535
Son.

540
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:18,872
Would you like to name the pavilion?

541
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,082
Father.

542
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,251
I do not understand
why we are in such a rush

543
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:25,462
to rebuild the palace.

544
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,844
The character for "palace"

545
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,305
combines the characters
for "spine" and "roof".

546
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:40,102
This symbolizes that the palace
is the country's spine.

547
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:41,812
Sovereign power is merely an idea.

548
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:44,940
You cannot attain true power
through ideas alone.

549
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,530
Six hundred, you say?

550
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:52,698
Yes, Your Majesty.

551
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,908
Since we are rebuilding it anyway,

552
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:58,120
I say it should have at least 6,000 rooms.

553
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:00,622
Yes, indeed.

554
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:06,211
KING SEONJO'S TEMPORARY RESIDENCE

555
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:19,057
All of you worked hard
to keep me safe during the war.

556
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,144
It delights me
to see you all gathered here.

557
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:24,896
We are much obliged, Your Majesty.

558
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,149
-We are much obliged.
-We are much obliged.

559
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,567
You may begin the feast.

560
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:35,991
Haven't feasted like this in ages.

561
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:39,286
The crows are chubby
thanks to the corpses.

562
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,919
-It's cooked to perfection.
-Thank you.

563
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,504
I'm about to pass out.

564
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,259
Well, can't be helped…

565
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:01,558
My goodness.

566
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:03,852
Once a nobleman, always a nobleman.

567
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:07,689
You think someone will pick out
the meat and feed you?

568
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,444
Must you put me on the spot?

569
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:18,283
Happy now?

570
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:19,868
Eat up.

571
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,169
This tastes awful.

572
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:32,714
General.

573
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:35,133
How many Japanese invaders did we kill?

574
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:38,470
Did they not say
commoners would get government titles

575
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:41,306
and slaves would be freed
for their contributions?

576
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,935
Those bastards never keep their word.

577
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,187
What is their excuse this time?

578
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:50,107
"It cannot be done
without the royal court's approval."

579
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,400
"We have no proof of your victories."

580
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:54,903
They have many excuses.

581
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:57,405
I plan to visit Hanyang

582
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,407
and request an audience with His Majesty.

583
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:02,786
I understand how you all feel,

584
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:06,206
but wait just a bit longer.

585
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,207
General.

586
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:11,253
Don't waste your time and energy
going to see the King.

587
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,588
Let's just settle down here.

588
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:18,969
How about we build a village here

589
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,763
and all live together?

590
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:23,682
Wouldn't that be nice?

591
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:26,476
General, I heard you sold your mansion

592
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,937
and everything you had
to fight for your country.

593
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,815
We will build an even bigger mansion.

594
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:32,941
Sure thing.

595
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:34,401
We have a roofer here.

596
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:35,402
-Where's the carpenter?
-Here.

597
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:37,821
Here's a carpenter.
We have everything we need.

598
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:41,032
Then how many rooms
will this mansion of mine have?

599
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:45,203
Yours? Didn't you hear me?

600
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:47,539
We'll all live together.

601
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,963
It was your slave, you said?

602
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:59,134
The one who killed your family.

603
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:04,598
I treated him as an equal
and took care of him,

604
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,725
but he kept running away,

605
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:08,977
so every time
my family hired slave hunters.

606
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:12,981
He threatened to burn my family alive,

607
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:17,194
and he ended up doing just that.

608
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:18,820
That is horrible.

609
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:22,365
However,

610
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:28,914
I cannot say
you are completely free from blame.

611
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:33,084
What was the reason
you treated him as an equal?

612
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:40,217
Your story reminds me of Jeong Yeo-rip

613
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:45,513
and his "Great Unity" or whatever.

614
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:49,434
It has nothing to do with him. I was just…

615
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:53,730
I know.

616
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,024
I understand.

617
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:59,402
Even if you grow fond
of some lowborn people,

618
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,863
you must learn to hide it.

619
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:06,243
Favoritism creates arrogance
in the select few,

620
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:10,080
while benevolence
breeds chaos in the many.

621
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:15,043
Such is the harsh fate
of those who rule, is it not?

622
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,130
Drink up.

623
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:25,887
I, too, experienced
such a tragic incident during the war.

624
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,557
So how could I not sympathize?

625
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:33,103
Many people experienced horrible things
during the war,

626
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:35,105
but nothing can compare
to what you went through.

627
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,357
We must restore the palace quickly

628
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,026
to ensure Your Majesty's safety.
This is our priority now.

629
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:43,530
Your Majesty.

630
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:46,950
The seven-year war has wreaked havoc
on our country.

631
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:51,413
The people are eating the flesh
of dead bodies lying around.

632
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:53,832
Such starved, ill people

633
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:57,252
cannot handle the massive effort
of constructing such a large palace.

634
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:00,547
On top of that, many of them

635
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,717
lost their noses to the Japanese army.

636
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,512
That was because of the bounty
Hideyoshi Toyotomi offered.

637
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:09,556
But it sounds as though you blame me.

638
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:10,515
Besides,

639
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:12,809
construction is not done with one's nose.

640
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:13,810
Your Majesty.

641
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,024
First, establish
an Agency of Meritorious Service

642
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:21,985
and make records of those
who contributed to our victory.

643
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:25,530
Then raise the lowborn status
of those who fought with all their might.

644
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:29,326
This will win back
the hearts of your people.

645
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:34,080
Why do you shed tears?

646
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:42,756
The Agency of Meritorious Service?
Yes, set it up.

647
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,424
I never said you couldn't.

648
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:45,508
However,

649
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:49,179
the restoration of Gyeongbokgung
cannot be put off either,

650
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:52,265
so establish a separate agency for that.

651
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:54,934
Do you understand?

652
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:06,279
There you go.

653
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,043
Head!

654
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,010
Hey! You fool.

655
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:31,096
I knew you would pull that.

656
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:08,174
There are rules you must follow
as a nobleman.

657
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,885
Why do you treat such a lowly man
as your friend?

658
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:14,889
What?

659
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:18,893
So a man can befriend his dog,

660
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:22,313
but not his slave?

661
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,651
A dog is to be raised,
whereas a slave is to be commanded.

662
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:30,363
Goodness.

663
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:32,323
Understood.

664
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,786
Then shall I go command my slave?

665
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:06,566
Let's hurry.

666
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,280
It's hot even at dawn.

667
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:14,115
Shut up and keep walking.

668
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:17,952
General!

669
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:20,955
General! Japanese soldiers are here!

670
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,042
Beom-dong! Hey, you too.

671
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,251
Come quickly!

672
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,712
I saw Japanese invaders in disguise.

673
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:29,047
Here and here.

674
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:33,468
If we attack from both sides, they will…

675
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:42,227
The King's palace…

676
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,688
Is it in that direction?

677
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:47,982
Is it not that way?

678
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:50,985
The direction of the Rat.

679
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:57,325
Damn, must we do this
every time we head to battle?

680
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:01,287
The King should come and bow to us. Damn!

681
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:13,424
General!

682
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:14,676
I think it is here.

683
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:25,019
This is it.

684
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:27,021
It is here!

685
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:33,778
Ambush! Ambush!

686
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:42,662
Do not back down!

687
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:43,746
Fight!

688
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:47,959
Here is what I think.
Let us not kill them.

689
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:49,586
-You're dead!
-Let us capture--

690
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:54,924
My, my…

691
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,136
What are you all waiting for?

692
00:59:58,219 --> 00:59:59,178
Let's go!

693
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:11,399
The blue-robed god!

694
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,033
General!

695
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,598
Well, who do we have here?

696
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:48,311
I have been wondering
who the blue-robed god could be.

697
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:50,063
You're the blue-robed god?

698
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:52,732
That scar suits you.

699
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:56,694
Want another? One on the other side
would make you even prettier.

700
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:59,822
He says he could give you
the same pretty scar on the other side.

701
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:02,742
Sure, why not?

702
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,327
You are still such a joker.

703
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,914
Have you eaten?

704
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,248
He is asking if you've eaten.

705
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:11,042
I never

706
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,503
eat breakfast!

707
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,075
Come on, you rat!

708
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:47,078
Bastards!

709
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:51,332
You bastards!

710
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:57,547
That little rat.

711
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:05,304
Damn it.

712
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:07,056
Yikes!

713
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:40,256
Chujo-ryu?

714
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:52,727
Thanks to me,

715
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:56,063
you will be able to see your nose
without a mirror.

716
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:24,926
Cut it out!

717
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:31,891
General!

718
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:34,018
-You must get out of here now!
-General!

719
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:38,397
Step back, and do not interfere.

720
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,775
This is a duel between us.

721
01:03:40,858 --> 01:03:42,860
He wants a duel with you.

722
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:48,574
Cheon-yeong!

723
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:51,536
Why are you still fighting?

724
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:53,913
We've finished them all off already.

725
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:54,956
Why are you here?

726
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:57,208
This will be over quickly too.

727
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:59,293
It sounds like they beat our men up there.

728
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:02,129
The General said to capture them alive.
You got that?

729
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:04,757
It doesn't sound like they'll kill us.

730
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,425
-Why, all of a sudden?
-Why not?

731
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:09,887
He wants to take them to the King
and use them to negotiate.

732
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:12,223
We need them alive

733
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:15,601
whether we want to get paid or freed.

734
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:16,853
How long will it take?

735
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:18,938
I'll be quick. Stay and watch if you want.

736
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:22,400
They will use us as bait
to strike a deal with the King.

737
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:26,279
Hey. Just throw it.

738
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:34,537
Hey, don't!

739
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:37,832
What is this?

740
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:40,710
And you call yourself a warrior?

741
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:41,919
What is he saying?

742
01:04:44,505 --> 01:04:46,799
It's not the way of a true warrior.

743
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:47,884
Idiot.

744
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:49,260
Goodness, seriously.

745
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:53,306
I was just about to
pierce his throat with my sword.

746
01:04:57,852 --> 01:04:59,770
Is this the Nose Snatcher?

747
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:00,813
It's the goblin helmet!

748
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:03,524
Did we just catch the Nose Snatcher?

749
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:04,984
"Nose Snatcher?"

750
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:08,905
The devil
that cut the noses off living people?

751
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:15,202
Is this gold?
We can easily build a village with this.

752
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:18,831
I guess it's true that the Japanese
have hidden away treasure.

753
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,167
Let me see.

754
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:23,002
Oh, my.

755
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:24,712
I will take them to Hanyang.

756
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:26,797
Put them back in.

757
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:29,717
What? Seriously?

758
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:34,972
It is our duty
to take these to the royal court.

759
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:37,600
The court will return them
to their rightful owners.

760
01:05:39,977 --> 01:05:40,978
Rightful, my ass.

761
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:45,650
Beom-dong, where are you going?

762
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:48,361
-Water!
-Me first!

763
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:56,702
Are you the notorious Nose Snatcher?

764
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:01,207
Are you the Nose Snatcher?

765
01:06:06,837 --> 01:06:08,214
How could you do this?

766
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:10,341
He wants water too.

767
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:14,053
You ignored me
when I asked for rice seven years ago.

768
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:16,263
He said you didn't give him rice balls,
remember?

769
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:17,932
On about rice again?

770
01:06:18,015 --> 01:06:20,142
You were using the Chujo-ryu technique.

771
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:21,602
Who taught you?

772
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:23,562
-What is he saying?
-Pardon?

773
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,731
The short sword technique.

774
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:28,651
My lord wonders who taught you
the short sword technique.

775
01:06:29,443 --> 01:06:30,528
Was it the battle in Namwon?

776
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:33,072
A guy wearing a hare-shaped helmet.

777
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:35,700
Someone who was wearing
a hare-shaped helmet in Namwon.

778
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:36,993
Do you know him?

779
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:39,829
I noticed his unique swordsmanship
and remembered it.

780
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:42,623
-Just… remembered?
-Yes.

781
01:06:43,207 --> 01:06:44,500
He learned it while fighting.

782
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:47,837
You see,
I cut his stomach open with my sword,

783
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:51,424
and his intestines all gushed out.

784
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:55,261
He said he cut his stomach open,
and his intestines gushed out.

785
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:59,140
I would like a rematch.

786
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:00,850
He wants a rematch.

787
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:03,561
The outcome will be no different.

788
01:07:03,644 --> 01:07:04,937
He said the outcome will be the same.

789
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:08,733
Go ahead and kill me, then,
like a true warrior!

790
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:11,527
He says he would rather get killed.

791
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:17,700
I have a use for you,

792
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:20,244
so stay alive.

793
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:23,205
He said he has a use for you.

794
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:25,958
What is it you are hiding

795
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,753
underneath that red cloth?

796
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:32,965
He asks what you are hiding
in that hand of yours.

797
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:57,615
You got scarred while training, okay?

798
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:10,544
This will be

799
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:14,006
the symbol
of placing first in Military Arts.

800
01:08:29,063 --> 01:08:31,232
-Have a bite!
-What an honor!

801
01:08:32,024 --> 01:08:34,318
Immediately upon passing the exam,

802
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:36,821
you have joined the Royal Guard.

803
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:40,950
Please destroy Cheon-yeong's slave papers.

804
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:47,206
Both your grandfather and I

805
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:49,834
had to start working
at the border regions.

806
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:51,418
Compared to that, you are so lucky.

807
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:53,045
Father.

808
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:55,131
The elders are waiting. Come along.

809
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:57,675
You gave your word!

810
01:09:00,052 --> 01:09:02,263
Did that lowly brat teach you

811
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:04,181
to be this rude?

812
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:12,731
That slave brought home
the royal flowers as promised.

813
01:09:15,734 --> 01:09:17,862
How could a nobleman go back on his word?

814
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:19,029
You fool!

815
01:09:21,448 --> 01:09:23,576
The moment he opens his mouth,

816
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:27,121
we become traitors to the King,
don't you know?

817
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:32,835
Cheon-yeong

818
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:36,589
is ready to leave now.

819
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:38,465
Very well.

820
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:41,427
Gwang-yi must be ready by now too.

821
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:53,480
Damn it.

822
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:56,734
He is not here.

823
01:09:56,817 --> 01:09:58,235
Gwang-yi, you sly rat.

824
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:02,281
I was ordered to catch him,

825
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:05,117
but Lord Yi said I need not
bring him back this time.

826
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:06,911
You do that,

827
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:09,747
and I will slice this arm off.

828
01:10:17,129 --> 01:10:18,631
I will not kill him.

829
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:38,692
Cheon… Cheon-yeong.

830
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:44,114
You said you'd bring my papers.

831
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:46,492
Where are they?

832
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:49,536
I am glad you are alive.

833
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:53,916
I am relieved you are alive.

834
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:04,551
Go far away.

835
01:11:05,552 --> 01:11:07,846
Go to the northern border
and defeat the barbarians,

836
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:10,432
or go to the southern sea
and catch pirates.

837
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:13,185
I heard some slaves were freed
after doing good for the country.

838
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:16,522
Do not, under any circumstances,
get caught--

839
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:17,523
Am I…

840
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:22,695
still your friend?

841
01:11:27,324 --> 01:11:28,242
Yes.

842
01:11:54,226 --> 01:11:55,602
So?

843
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:59,523
Are you saying these are all appeals
requesting that Kim Ja-ryeong

844
01:11:59,606 --> 01:12:02,151
and his army be commended
for their achievement?

845
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:05,738
I hear everyone in the country
is praising him,

846
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:09,158
saying, "Admiral Sun-sin protects the sea,
General Ja-ryeong protects the land."

847
01:12:14,538 --> 01:12:15,456
Why is it that

848
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:19,710
Ja-ryeong is still alive
when Sun-sin is dead?

849
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:24,757
I do not see a single report
on the palace's restoration.

850
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:27,885
The Palace Construction Agency
created a budget

851
01:12:27,968 --> 01:12:30,429
to figure out how many workers we'd need,

852
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:34,433
but they have concluded
we cannot afford it at the moment.

853
01:12:58,332 --> 01:12:59,375
Oh, dear.

854
01:13:06,965 --> 01:13:08,467
Look at that perfect posture.

855
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:13,555
Nice!

856
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:17,893
Nice!

857
01:13:20,771 --> 01:13:22,272
That ugly haircut…

858
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:24,775
Is it a Japanese style?

859
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:28,070
Those greedy idiots.

860
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:34,660
People who fought off the enemy

861
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:36,745
are eating corpses to stay alive,

862
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:40,916
yet the noblemen who buttered up the enemy

863
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:44,336
are chomping on beef ribs…

864
01:13:45,712 --> 01:13:47,923
Both are the same meat, should I think?

865
01:13:48,006 --> 01:13:50,134
I will tell His Majesty all about

866
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:53,887
that traitorous Cheongju mayor
and have him dismissed.

867
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:55,305
Dismissed, you say?

868
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:59,143
Even piercing his neck now
wouldn't quell my temper.

869
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:00,727
Isn't it so, Cheon… What?

870
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:04,481
Hey, what are you doing?

871
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:05,941
We have a long way to go.

872
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:07,860
Stop fighting.

873
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:10,154
Let's get some sleep.

874
01:14:15,742 --> 01:14:17,119
We should all…

875
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:20,539
go our separate ways.

876
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:25,544
Do you call this a country?

877
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:29,965
I can't stand you singing about
"His Majesty" all the time.

878
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:33,760
And that idiot who only cares
about upping his status disgusts me.

879
01:14:33,844 --> 01:14:37,514
It is not like
we planned to stick together forever.

880
01:14:37,598 --> 01:14:39,600
We must return to our rightful places.

881
01:14:40,392 --> 01:14:42,436
Rightful places, my foot.

882
01:14:42,519 --> 01:14:45,981
Fine,
go and get your slave status cancelled.

883
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:47,774
And a government title.

884
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:49,693
I hope you live a good life.

885
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:52,529
It is true
that the court once lost its way,

886
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:55,073
but the seven-year war is now over.

887
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:57,701
With the brilliant Crown Prince,

888
01:14:57,784 --> 01:15:00,287
don't you think
the royal court will regain its dignity?

889
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:04,875
Let us trust that the government
will punish the corrupt officials.

890
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:07,544
Goodness, this is so frustrating.

891
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:10,172
I am so angry right now.

892
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:12,299
This is…

893
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:16,220
This is why

894
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:19,640
believing that
you noblemen and us lowlives

895
01:15:19,723 --> 01:15:23,101
could get along harmoniously

896
01:15:24,811 --> 01:15:26,438
was nothing but a vain dream.

897
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:33,987
Even so, General…

898
01:15:35,113 --> 01:15:38,825
I have met only one
truly noble nobleman in my life,

899
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:41,662
and that was you.

900
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:47,292
Please be well.

901
01:15:50,128 --> 01:15:51,421
We even caught the Nose Snatcher!

902
01:15:52,297 --> 01:15:54,967
This time,
the court cannot ignore our achievement.

903
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:56,760
What we wanted is right before us!

904
01:15:56,843 --> 01:15:58,262
What is with you, all of a sudden?

905
01:16:00,097 --> 01:16:01,890
-Beom-dong!
-Let's go.

906
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:03,976
Let's go. Everyone get up.

907
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:07,980
Cheon-yeong,
take good care of General Kim.

908
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,856
An internal conflict has erupted.

909
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:17,698
Mr. Tactician.

910
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:30,127
My, look at that ugly head.

911
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:32,838
A true Japanese head.

912
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:34,256
How about it?

913
01:16:34,798 --> 01:16:35,632
You saw it, huh?

914
01:16:39,553 --> 01:16:41,888
Quietly drop off a sack of rice
in front of each home.

915
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:44,558
Everyone will be so surprised
in the morning.

916
01:16:45,058 --> 01:16:47,436
-Have some food first.
-Yes, sir.

917
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,271
Oh, my. It looks delicious.

918
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:50,939
I brought some more.

919
01:16:52,065 --> 01:16:53,942
-I haven't had rice in so long.
-Same here.

920
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:55,652
Do you not know who I am?

921
01:16:56,194 --> 01:16:57,904
I am the county mayor of Cheongju,

922
01:16:57,988 --> 01:16:59,781
appointed by His Majesty.
You lowly good-for-nothings.

923
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:03,285
You beasts do not even know
basic Confucian virtues!

924
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:07,372
Virtues, you say?

925
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:09,541
All I know

926
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:12,210
is the virtues of my flail.

927
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:19,009
SODEOKMUN GATE, HANYANG

928
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:22,888
General Kim Ja-ryeong is here!

929
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:25,223
General Kim Ja-ryeong is here!

930
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:27,017
General Kim is here?

931
01:17:33,398 --> 01:17:35,734
-Nice job, everyone
-Thank you.

932
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:37,861
-Die!
-Damn, that hurts!

933
01:17:41,531 --> 01:17:44,826
The corrupt officials are even worse
than the Japanese invaders.

934
01:17:45,577 --> 01:17:48,330
The construction of Gyeongbokgung Palace
is claiming many lives.

935
01:17:48,413 --> 01:17:50,957
I will be sure to let His Majesty know,

936
01:17:51,541 --> 01:17:54,211
so please bear with it
for just a bit longer.

937
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:57,547
-Hooray!
-Hooray!

938
01:18:08,392 --> 01:18:11,144
I must say,
it almost looks like a king's parade.

939
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:13,188
Do you not agree?

940
01:18:23,865 --> 01:18:28,870
Only Ming emperors
hear such enthusiastic cheers.

941
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:33,709
What do you think
of those people's cheers?

942
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:38,630
The ignorant masses enjoy

943
01:18:39,339 --> 01:18:41,800
absurd military tales
and outlandish hero stories.

944
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:43,260
That's just how it is.

945
01:18:43,343 --> 01:18:45,679
You need not be concerned.

946
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:50,434
What is it?

947
01:18:51,017 --> 01:18:52,936
A letter from the district inspector.

948
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:54,646
It is urgent.

949
01:18:57,649 --> 01:19:00,193
The Cheongju mayor was killed
a few days ago.

950
01:19:00,277 --> 01:19:02,696
Word has it that it was done
by Kim Ja-ryeong's followers.

951
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:07,367
Did something happen?

952
01:19:12,789 --> 01:19:14,791
-Hooray!
-Hooray!

953
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:17,586
-Hooray!
-Hooray!

954
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:23,675
Fall back!

955
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:24,968
What is with all this fuss?

956
01:19:25,051 --> 01:19:26,261
Step back.

957
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:36,229
His Majesty wishes
a private audience with you, General Kim.

958
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:42,944
I would hate to reek of sweat
before His Majesty.

959
01:19:58,627 --> 01:19:59,586
Oh, right.

960
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:03,048
His Majesty will ask about your name.

961
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:06,510
What did you say your name meant?

962
01:20:08,053 --> 01:20:12,474
A lowly slave's name has no meaning.

963
01:20:12,557 --> 01:20:14,935
"Cheon" as in "sky"
and "Yeong" as in "shining."

964
01:20:16,186 --> 01:20:19,356
Those are the characters
I would have chosen if I were your father.

965
01:20:21,608 --> 01:20:23,026
I will see you in a bit.

966
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:31,201
We have prepared meat and wine.

967
01:20:31,284 --> 01:20:34,746
You must be famished
after the long journey. Follow me.

968
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:37,666
-Let's go have some meat!
-Yes!

969
01:20:37,749 --> 01:20:38,917
Come on. Let's go!

970
01:20:44,089 --> 01:20:47,467
It is not like Ja-ryeong killed
the Cheongju mayor himself.

971
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:51,555
They followed
and fought alongside him for seven years.

972
01:20:51,638 --> 01:20:52,681
That cannot be.

973
01:20:53,431 --> 01:20:56,309
Ja-ryeong is also a Confucian scholar.

974
01:20:56,393 --> 01:20:59,896
I know
he is not such an ignorant scoundrel.

975
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:05,694
Shall I call him here

976
01:21:05,777 --> 01:21:07,612
and question him myself?

977
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:19,875
On the command of the King!

978
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:22,794
Tie up Kim Ja-ryeong for plotting treason!

979
01:21:28,174 --> 01:21:30,176
They promised us drinks and meat…

980
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:32,554
-What is going on?
-What?

981
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:39,269
They are all guilty of treason.

982
01:21:39,352 --> 01:21:41,062
Do not spare any of them.

983
01:21:48,862 --> 01:21:49,863
Treason?

984
01:22:06,046 --> 01:22:09,507
I used the blunt edge of my sword
for I could not slay the King's guards.

985
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:10,967
Now, go and relay my words!

986
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:14,763
Tell His Majesty
that his loyal subject, Ja-ryeong,

987
01:22:14,846 --> 01:22:17,557
requests an audience with him
in his chamber.

988
01:22:37,243 --> 01:22:39,079
What are you waiting for? Get him!

989
01:22:52,175 --> 01:22:53,468
Get him!

990
01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:07,232
Why are you silent?

991
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:11,528
My body burns with smokeless flame,

992
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:15,448
but I do not know how to put it out.

993
01:23:16,116 --> 01:23:17,117
You are on fire?

994
01:23:18,702 --> 01:23:20,704
Did you eat chili peppers?

995
01:23:20,787 --> 01:23:22,414
Did your virtue as a monarch

996
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:26,251
burn to ashes with your palace?

997
01:23:26,751 --> 01:23:28,086
Did you hear that?

998
01:23:29,796 --> 01:23:31,506
Even this traitor says

999
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:34,009
the palace must rise from the ashes

1000
01:23:34,092 --> 01:23:36,636
to restore my virtue as monarch.

1001
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:39,597
What a true Confucian scholar he is.

1002
01:23:45,395 --> 01:23:46,521
Beom-dong.

1003
01:23:48,898 --> 01:23:51,276
You never learned to read,

1004
01:23:52,861 --> 01:23:54,571
but you read this world better than me.

1005
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:09,002
My gosh…

1006
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:12,172
How can this be?

1007
01:25:37,006 --> 01:25:39,717
Hello, Young Master. Have you been well?

1008
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:50,520
I, Cheon-yeong, am here to greet you.

1009
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:09,706
Even a dog is rewarded

1010
01:26:09,789 --> 01:26:12,625
with a bowl of food
after catching a thief.

1011
01:26:13,877 --> 01:26:16,754
Yet the King, who promised to reward us,

1012
01:26:17,922 --> 01:26:20,049
has framed and killed us.

1013
01:26:22,635 --> 01:26:24,470
Just like your father.

1014
01:26:29,267 --> 01:26:31,477
A dog that bites its master
must be put to death.

1015
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:39,319
I thought you, of all people,
would be different!

1016
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:41,154
How could you?

1017
01:26:42,447 --> 01:26:44,699
How dare you say that?

1018
01:27:19,609 --> 01:27:22,111
I was a fool
for befriending a lowly slave.

1019
01:27:24,614 --> 01:27:25,823
For that, I resent myself.

1020
01:27:27,367 --> 01:27:29,202
I never asked you to be my friend.

1021
01:27:34,749 --> 01:27:35,959
I should have…

1022
01:27:37,418 --> 01:27:38,920
just raised a dog instead.

1023
01:27:39,003 --> 01:27:39,963
Of course,

1024
01:27:41,839 --> 01:27:44,384
you and your wife
are like two peas in a pod.

1025
01:28:32,098 --> 01:28:33,433
Damn you, Cheon-yeong!

1026
01:28:52,076 --> 01:28:53,619
-Hurry up!
-Over there!

1027
01:29:02,378 --> 01:29:04,380
Since you branded me a traitor,

1028
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:08,134
that is what I will become.

1029
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:10,887
Hurry up!

1030
01:29:17,518 --> 01:29:19,896
Follow him! Over there!

1031
01:29:25,902 --> 01:29:28,404
The traitors' heads are gone!

1032
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:43,002
REVOLT

1033
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:49,258
I have executed Ja-ryeong,
following your loyal advice.

1034
01:29:52,303 --> 01:29:54,097
But appeals are pouring in,

1035
01:29:57,892 --> 01:30:00,436
demanding that I right the wrong

1036
01:30:01,312 --> 01:30:03,231
by holding you accountable.

1037
01:30:04,148 --> 01:30:06,526
I also hear riots have been taking place
all over the country.

1038
01:30:07,610 --> 01:30:09,237
What should I do?

1039
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:26,003
How exquisite.

1040
01:30:27,713 --> 01:30:29,882
I am surprised this is still in Joseon.

1041
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:33,302
The Nose Snatcher and his men
were headed back to Suncheon.

1042
01:30:33,386 --> 01:30:35,638
They were planning to retrieve
the hidden treasure chests

1043
01:30:36,514 --> 01:30:39,016
to offer them to you, Your Majesty.

1044
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:41,894
"Chests"?

1045
01:30:42,478 --> 01:30:45,231
If there is that much treasure…

1046
01:30:45,314 --> 01:30:47,233
We can sell it
to Ming's antique merchants and…

1047
01:30:47,316 --> 01:30:49,861
…raise the funds needed
to rebuild Gyeongbokgung.

1048
01:30:51,779 --> 01:30:53,030
Where?

1049
01:30:53,573 --> 01:30:55,241
Where are these treasure chests?

1050
01:30:56,576 --> 01:30:57,577
Where are they hidden?

1051
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:09,672
I am Yi Jong-ryeo
of Royal Investigation Bureau.

1052
01:31:09,755 --> 01:31:11,048
Yi Jong-ryeo?

1053
01:31:18,931 --> 01:31:20,641
What is it that you want?

1054
01:31:21,684 --> 01:31:22,852
The blue-robed god.

1055
01:31:30,026 --> 01:31:32,487
Why not have the Japanese soldiers
who voluntarily surrendered

1056
01:31:34,071 --> 01:31:36,532
join the government army
and search for the treasure in secret?

1057
01:31:41,621 --> 01:31:45,333
The ministers will flail me
with their merciless tongues.

1058
01:31:46,292 --> 01:31:49,462
If we tell them
we are doing it to quell the riots…

1059
01:31:51,464 --> 01:31:53,424
No, actually…

1060
01:31:54,634 --> 01:31:56,469
If they quell the riots as well,

1061
01:31:56,552 --> 01:31:58,763
it will be catching two birds
with one stone.

1062
01:31:58,846 --> 01:32:00,848
I will use this opportunity to wipe out

1063
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,227
what is left of Kim Ja-ryeong's followers.

1064
01:32:05,895 --> 01:32:07,230
The surrendered Japanese general

1065
01:32:08,397 --> 01:32:11,526
will lead the unit of defected soldiers,

1066
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:13,736
and his new name shall be
Kim Choong-myeon.

1067
01:32:13,819 --> 01:32:14,654
Your Majesty.

1068
01:32:14,737 --> 01:32:17,615
If anything, that Japanese general
should be beheaded at once.

1069
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:19,909
But to have him kill our own people?

1070
01:32:20,493 --> 01:32:22,161
Please reconsider!

1071
01:32:22,245 --> 01:32:24,914
-Please reconsider, Your Majesty.
-Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

1072
01:32:26,499 --> 01:32:27,667
They set my palace ablaze

1073
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:31,170
and dared to hurl stones at their King.

1074
01:32:33,214 --> 01:32:34,423
You call them my people?

1075
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:37,969
You call them humans?

1076
01:32:43,516 --> 01:32:47,019
In the past,
I set up a separate military unit

1077
01:32:47,103 --> 01:32:49,897
made up solely of
surrendered Japanese soldiers.

1078
01:32:49,981 --> 01:32:53,109
At first, people were shocked,

1079
01:32:53,192 --> 01:32:55,152
but I had my reasons.

1080
01:32:55,945 --> 01:32:58,364
Choong-myeon is now my loyal subject.

1081
01:32:59,407 --> 01:33:01,576
So do not bring up his past.

1082
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:02,535
Furthermore,

1083
01:33:03,286 --> 01:33:05,246
I appoint Yi Jong-ryeo
of the Investigation Bureau

1084
01:33:05,329 --> 01:33:06,747
as Chief of Punitive Forces.

1085
01:33:07,707 --> 01:33:10,918
He will lead the newly formed unit
to take down the traitors

1086
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:13,671
and demonstrate the severity of the law.

1087
01:33:14,463 --> 01:33:15,590
I, Jong-ryeo,

1088
01:33:16,799 --> 01:33:19,552
humbly accept Your Majesty's command
to lay the foundation

1089
01:33:20,344 --> 01:33:22,054
for rebuilding our country.

1090
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:04,889
Brother!

1091
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:08,726
What happened?

1092
01:34:09,727 --> 01:34:12,104
I thought
you'd have a government post by now.

1093
01:34:12,813 --> 01:34:14,565
What happened? You are a mess.

1094
01:34:16,525 --> 01:34:17,526
My goodness.

1095
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:48,432
Hey!

1096
01:34:49,183 --> 01:34:50,393
Hey!

1097
01:34:53,312 --> 01:34:54,522
What did I say?

1098
01:34:58,067 --> 01:34:59,235
What did I tell you?

1099
01:35:00,528 --> 01:35:02,697
I told you not to go there, did I not?

1100
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:04,198
What did I tell you?

1101
01:35:05,408 --> 01:35:06,909
-Let go!
-Stop. That is enough.

1102
01:35:06,992 --> 01:35:08,202
-I told you not to go!
-Stop.

1103
01:35:08,285 --> 01:35:10,496
Look what you did!

1104
01:35:10,579 --> 01:35:13,249
-Stop.
-You did all that to live a better life.

1105
01:35:13,332 --> 01:35:15,584
I told you not to go.

1106
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:18,921
Look what you did!

1107
01:35:20,548 --> 01:35:22,800
Look what you have done!

1108
01:35:25,177 --> 01:35:26,637
What will you do with that?

1109
01:35:27,346 --> 01:35:28,597
Hey, Cheon-yeong.

1110
01:35:29,181 --> 01:35:31,392
Let's have a proper duel today.

1111
01:35:31,976 --> 01:35:33,436
-Stop.
-Just talk it out.

1112
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:35,938
Goodness! Seriously.

1113
01:35:37,231 --> 01:35:38,315
What is that?

1114
01:35:38,399 --> 01:35:39,608
What are you doing?

1115
01:35:40,151 --> 01:35:41,819
Are you planning to bow to the King?

1116
01:35:41,902 --> 01:35:42,862
I cannot!

1117
01:35:50,119 --> 01:35:51,996
I cannot go on this way any longer.

1118
01:35:57,585 --> 01:36:00,087
RAT

1119
01:36:18,898 --> 01:36:21,692
You can survive a war,

1120
01:36:21,776 --> 01:36:23,819
but not a revolt.

1121
01:36:26,572 --> 01:36:28,282
Whether we die fighting the Japanese

1122
01:36:28,365 --> 01:36:30,075
or defying the King,

1123
01:36:31,494 --> 01:36:32,703
it's all the same.

1124
01:36:32,787 --> 01:36:34,997
There are about 30 of us.

1125
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:36,540
We simply cannot pull off a revolt.

1126
01:36:37,124 --> 01:36:39,668
We can find more people to join us.

1127
01:36:39,752 --> 01:36:41,253
Just put up a poster,

1128
01:36:42,296 --> 01:36:44,048
and they will swarm here
like a family of sardines.

1129
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:46,258
How will we feed and clothe them?

1130
01:36:46,342 --> 01:36:47,802
Sir, you told me

1131
01:36:47,885 --> 01:36:50,221
that the Japanese have hidden treasure.

1132
01:36:50,304 --> 01:36:51,514
Hold on.

1133
01:36:52,014 --> 01:36:53,516
When we caught the Nose Snatcher,

1134
01:36:53,599 --> 01:36:56,519
remember the empty wagons
those Japanese rats had?

1135
01:36:56,602 --> 01:36:58,687
I wonder why they dragged
such heavy wagons into the woods.

1136
01:36:59,313 --> 01:37:01,649
To carry the hidden treasure?

1137
01:37:02,399 --> 01:37:05,069
Come to think of it,
all the old trees were marked.

1138
01:37:05,152 --> 01:37:06,403
That's right.

1139
01:37:06,487 --> 01:37:08,239
Yes, that's it.

1140
01:37:08,322 --> 01:37:09,156
Let us go back there.

1141
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:10,991
The key to a revolt is speed.

1142
01:37:11,867 --> 01:37:12,910
Let us hurry.

1143
01:37:12,993 --> 01:37:14,787
Here, I think this was the spot.

1144
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:17,122
Yes, it is here.

1145
01:37:19,041 --> 01:37:20,793
-Let's see.
-My goodness!

1146
01:37:22,253 --> 01:37:23,337
We found it.

1147
01:37:23,921 --> 01:37:25,756
We found the treasure!

1148
01:37:30,678 --> 01:37:32,263
We need at least two more wagons.

1149
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:34,390
Where will we find wagons?

1150
01:37:35,474 --> 01:37:37,268
Let's use the horses to carry the rest.

1151
01:37:37,351 --> 01:37:38,561
Shall we do that?

1152
01:37:39,103 --> 01:37:42,231
I believe it's none of your business.

1153
01:37:43,107 --> 01:37:45,609
-What are you doing?
-Sir!

1154
01:37:45,693 --> 01:37:47,611
-Stay still!
-What's the matter with you?

1155
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:49,697
-You think we're Japanese invaders?
-What are you doing?

1156
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:51,490
-Stay still!
-Hey, stay out of it.

1157
01:37:51,574 --> 01:37:54,910
If you wish to risk your life to revolt,
stand over there.

1158
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:59,164
But if you wish to share this treasure
and live in prosperity,

1159
01:37:59,248 --> 01:38:00,291
stand behind me.

1160
01:38:00,374 --> 01:38:02,126
Damn it.

1161
01:38:04,753 --> 01:38:07,214
What is left after risking our lives
for seven years?

1162
01:38:08,507 --> 01:38:11,051
At this time, risking our lives is hard.

1163
01:38:11,886 --> 01:38:12,887
But living our lives is easy.

1164
01:38:12,970 --> 01:38:14,263
That's not true!

1165
01:38:14,346 --> 01:38:15,890
If you truly wish to live,

1166
01:38:15,973 --> 01:38:17,558
the only way is to fight and win.

1167
01:38:18,267 --> 01:38:19,560
If we stop here,

1168
01:38:19,643 --> 01:38:22,980
they'll chase us for the rest of our lives
and kill us in the end.

1169
01:38:24,565 --> 01:38:26,191
I don't want to hear your drivel.

1170
01:38:28,277 --> 01:38:31,614
Stand over there
if you want me to smash your head in.

1171
01:38:33,908 --> 01:38:35,659
Hey, what are you doing?

1172
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:39,622
Damn it. I don't care if I die tomorrow.

1173
01:38:39,705 --> 01:38:41,498
I want to enjoy that treasure just once.

1174
01:38:42,124 --> 01:38:43,500
And you fools dare to say

1175
01:38:44,293 --> 01:38:47,755
that you fought under the leadership
of General Kim Ja-ryeong?

1176
01:38:47,838 --> 01:38:50,883
What are you waiting for?
Load them onto the wagons.

1177
01:38:51,425 --> 01:38:52,509
Let's go.

1178
01:38:53,552 --> 01:38:55,220
-Beom-dong!
-Let's go.

1179
01:38:55,304 --> 01:38:58,015
Why drag him away against his will?

1180
01:39:03,646 --> 01:39:04,813
Face forward.

1181
01:39:07,650 --> 01:39:09,109
Do you want to go back?

1182
01:39:11,612 --> 01:39:13,113
You will be facing death.

1183
01:39:14,698 --> 01:39:15,658
Yes.

1184
01:39:18,494 --> 01:39:21,705
Go back,
before they get eaten by wild beasts.

1185
01:39:26,961 --> 01:39:27,920
Goodbye.

1186
01:39:30,297 --> 01:39:36,220
I want to live

1187
01:39:36,303 --> 01:39:40,224
Hurrah, how exciting

1188
01:39:40,307 --> 01:39:45,437
I want to live in a big mansion

1189
01:39:45,521 --> 01:39:48,774
Hurrah, how exciting

1190
01:39:48,857 --> 01:39:51,819
I want to eat

1191
01:39:51,902 --> 01:39:54,363
Hurrah, how exciting

1192
01:39:54,446 --> 01:39:57,116
I want to eat a royal meal

1193
01:39:57,199 --> 01:39:59,618
Hurrah, how exciting

1194
01:39:59,702 --> 01:40:01,912
Hurrah, how exciting

1195
01:40:01,996 --> 01:40:04,498
Hurrah, how exciting

1196
01:40:06,542 --> 01:40:07,418
What is it?

1197
01:40:51,628 --> 01:40:53,088
Where is your leader Cheon-yeong?

1198
01:40:57,843 --> 01:41:00,137
The Nose Snatcher? How could he…

1199
01:41:06,226 --> 01:41:09,438
Cut the heads off those rebels!

1200
01:41:23,410 --> 01:41:25,662
Hey, kiddo. What brings you here?

1201
01:41:40,761 --> 01:41:43,097
What happened here? What is all this?

1202
01:41:49,186 --> 01:41:50,395
Hey, Mr. Tactician.

1203
01:41:56,819 --> 01:41:58,278
You should have just…

1204
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:00,572
died at my hands.

1205
01:42:11,291 --> 01:42:13,710
"I will hang heads and wait."

1206
01:42:14,336 --> 01:42:15,879
"Yi Jong-ryeo."

1207
01:42:39,111 --> 01:42:40,320
Move them over here.

1208
01:42:40,404 --> 01:42:41,405
Tie them tightly.

1209
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:54,001
The boat will arrive at low tide.

1210
01:42:55,127 --> 01:42:57,421
Until then, the unit will stand guard,

1211
01:42:58,005 --> 01:42:59,756
and the palace guards
will seek the remaining rebels.

1212
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:00,674
Yes, sir.

1213
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:16,773
Those bastards.

1214
01:43:18,859 --> 01:43:20,277
I'll kill them all.

1215
01:43:22,654 --> 01:43:24,198
Wait.

1216
01:43:24,990 --> 01:43:26,408
I think something is up.

1217
01:43:26,491 --> 01:43:28,202
-Aim!
-Aim!

1218
01:43:31,330 --> 01:43:32,289
What is going on?

1219
01:43:42,424 --> 01:43:43,717
Oh, dear.

1220
01:43:47,596 --> 01:43:51,391
We, too, are a military unit
that receives His Majesty's commands.

1221
01:43:51,475 --> 01:43:54,603
Do you intend to commit treason too?

1222
01:43:55,437 --> 01:43:57,856
"We belong to the King's army too.
Are you a traitor--"

1223
01:43:57,940 --> 01:44:00,108
You are our enemy
we should forever seek revenge on.

1224
01:44:01,610 --> 01:44:03,195
You will never leave here alive.

1225
01:44:03,278 --> 01:44:05,405
He never planned to let us leave.

1226
01:44:05,989 --> 01:44:07,741
We will chew your flesh,

1227
01:44:08,742 --> 01:44:10,953
skin you, and sleep in your leather.

1228
01:44:12,246 --> 01:44:13,080
Fire!

1229
01:44:20,629 --> 01:44:24,174
You left the maintenance
of the guns to us, you idiots.

1230
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:25,801
Just what I thought they'd do.

1231
01:44:30,013 --> 01:44:33,350
If the barrel is blocked,
the firearm will explode.

1232
01:44:33,433 --> 01:44:36,186
Does it not remind you of the mess
Joseon is in now?

1233
01:44:38,063 --> 01:44:38,897
Men!

1234
01:44:50,742 --> 01:44:52,619
What on earth is happening?

1235
01:44:54,621 --> 01:44:56,665
How ludicrous.

1236
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:27,321
The fog is thickening.

1237
01:45:27,404 --> 01:45:29,656
I'm not sure we can set sail on time.

1238
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:31,658
We are in no rush.

1239
01:45:32,326 --> 01:45:34,036
-Yes, sir.
-My Lord.

1240
01:46:10,364 --> 01:46:11,948
Interesting.

1241
01:46:13,075 --> 01:46:14,785
You two are different yet similar.

1242
01:46:15,702 --> 01:46:17,704
Similar yet different.

1243
01:46:19,498 --> 01:46:21,124
You and the blue-robed god.

1244
01:46:22,167 --> 01:46:23,043
What is it?

1245
01:46:23,126 --> 01:46:24,878
What's your relationship
with the blue-robed god?

1246
01:46:24,961 --> 01:46:27,047
You are different yet similar,

1247
01:46:27,130 --> 01:46:28,298
similar but different.

1248
01:46:38,642 --> 01:46:42,229
The anger in your sword
is different from his.

1249
01:46:43,021 --> 01:46:44,064
Why does he

1250
01:46:44,147 --> 01:46:46,942
have your sword?

1251
01:46:48,235 --> 01:46:49,361
Did he steal it?

1252
01:46:49,444 --> 01:46:52,823
Did the blue-robed god steal your sword?

1253
01:46:54,199 --> 01:46:55,867
I gave it to him.

1254
01:46:55,951 --> 01:46:57,577
He says he gave it to him.

1255
01:46:58,870 --> 01:46:59,955
I will not kill you.

1256
01:47:00,914 --> 01:47:03,291
When we exchange prisoners,
you'll be worth a hundred of my soldiers.

1257
01:47:03,375 --> 01:47:06,461
By keeping you alive,
we can save a hundred of our soldiers,

1258
01:47:06,545 --> 01:47:08,463
so my lord will not kill you.

1259
01:47:27,732 --> 01:47:29,484
You're both of the same kind.

1260
01:47:29,568 --> 01:47:33,155
I will treat you equally.

1261
01:47:38,285 --> 01:47:40,203
It is the blue-robed god!

1262
01:48:01,057 --> 01:48:02,350
Don't.

1263
01:48:02,934 --> 01:48:05,145
I have a use for him,

1264
01:48:05,228 --> 01:48:06,730
so be nice and keep him alive.

1265
01:48:06,813 --> 01:48:08,482
He has a use for him,

1266
01:48:08,565 --> 01:48:11,151
so my lord wants you to keep him alive.

1267
01:48:11,234 --> 01:48:13,236
I will kill you both.

1268
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:42,349
Bring me my foot… shit!

1269
01:48:43,934 --> 01:48:45,101
Are you all right?

1270
01:49:05,247 --> 01:49:06,122
You little!

1271
01:50:02,512 --> 01:50:03,638
Got you!

1272
01:50:12,856 --> 01:50:14,316
You lowly bitch!

1273
01:50:59,444 --> 01:51:00,654
Don't be such a weakling.

1274
01:51:02,489 --> 01:51:05,283
Some died with their heads cut off.

1275
01:51:08,286 --> 01:51:10,246
What about those burned to death?

1276
01:51:11,414 --> 01:51:14,417
I will rip you to shreds

1277
01:51:15,627 --> 01:51:18,463
and throw them all into a raging fire.

1278
01:51:19,047 --> 01:51:20,215
My father!

1279
01:51:21,633 --> 01:51:22,634
My mother!

1280
01:51:23,176 --> 01:51:24,177
My son!

1281
01:51:26,346 --> 01:51:29,099
And my wife.
You will now suffer what you did to them.

1282
01:51:38,733 --> 01:51:41,444
Is that what you believed all along?

1283
01:51:43,488 --> 01:51:45,782
Or is that what you want to believe?

1284
01:51:47,367 --> 01:51:49,202
I tried to save them,

1285
01:51:49,285 --> 01:51:52,038
but your wife jumped into the flames,

1286
01:51:53,331 --> 01:51:55,250
with your son in her arms.

1287
01:51:55,333 --> 01:51:56,668
You bastard!

1288
01:51:58,378 --> 01:51:59,629
There is no way.

1289
01:52:02,215 --> 01:52:03,341
Why would she do that?

1290
01:52:05,593 --> 01:52:06,803
Why?

1291
01:52:08,388 --> 01:52:10,265
She called me a brute.

1292
01:52:19,232 --> 01:52:21,067
I am bored and can wait no longer.

1293
01:53:17,582 --> 01:53:18,541
Die!

1294
01:55:13,698 --> 01:55:14,699
Cheon-yeong.

1295
01:55:16,451 --> 01:55:17,744
Am I still…

1296
01:55:21,581 --> 01:55:22,790
your friend?

1297
01:55:44,270 --> 01:55:46,147
I am sorry.

1298
01:56:00,078 --> 01:56:01,371
Jong-ryeo.

1299
01:56:29,482 --> 01:56:33,152
It is just like I saw in my dreams.

1300
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:37,448
Minister of Finance.

1301
01:56:37,532 --> 01:56:38,700
Yes, Your Majesty.

1302
01:56:38,783 --> 01:56:42,120
When will we cut down
the pine trees in Mt. Namsan?

1303
01:56:42,203 --> 01:56:43,371
The thing is,

1304
01:56:43,454 --> 01:56:46,666
the trees hold a lot of moisture
in summer, so…

1305
01:56:50,586 --> 01:56:51,963
It is I, Eunuch Kim.

1306
01:56:52,839 --> 01:56:53,798
You may enter.

1307
01:56:57,927 --> 01:57:00,972
It is said that a cargo vessel
arrived at Hangangjin Port,

1308
01:57:01,764 --> 01:57:03,725
and it has the flag of the Royal Guard.

1309
01:57:10,732 --> 01:57:13,026
Is Jong-ryeo still nowhere to be found?

1310
01:57:13,109 --> 01:57:16,362
They searched every nook and cranny,
but there was no one.

1311
01:57:16,446 --> 01:57:18,740
Are you saying the ship
sailed here on its own?

1312
01:57:20,450 --> 01:57:24,120
All the troops have disappeared…
I can't believe it.

1313
01:57:27,665 --> 01:57:29,417
Go ahead and open them.

1314
01:57:34,422 --> 01:57:36,132
What is taking so long?

1315
01:57:36,215 --> 01:57:39,469
Over here! This lock is broken.

1316
01:57:39,552 --> 01:57:40,803
Good!

1317
01:57:40,887 --> 01:57:42,263
Keep on chopping!

1318
01:57:42,346 --> 01:57:43,306
Yes, Your Majesty!

1319
01:57:48,519 --> 01:57:49,687
Open it.

1320
01:58:06,996 --> 01:58:08,831
What's this salt?

1321
01:58:09,791 --> 01:58:11,751
-This one is open too!
-This one too.

1322
01:58:11,834 --> 01:58:13,961
-We opened ours too.
-We got it open.

1323
01:58:14,045 --> 01:58:15,588
We got it open!

1324
01:58:16,714 --> 01:58:17,882
Start digging.

1325
01:58:17,965 --> 01:58:18,925
Yes, Your Majesty.

1326
01:58:22,762 --> 01:58:24,138
You may turn it over.

1327
01:58:47,328 --> 01:58:48,704
Your Majesty.

1328
01:58:50,373 --> 01:58:51,624
Your Majesty.

1329
01:59:04,428 --> 01:59:09,350
CHAOS

1330
01:59:10,601 --> 01:59:14,397
Attention!

1331
01:59:16,107 --> 01:59:18,568
To punish those who leech off the people,

1332
01:59:18,651 --> 01:59:21,320
we must all join forces!

1333
01:59:21,404 --> 01:59:23,739
-That's right!
-That's right!

1334
01:59:23,823 --> 01:59:27,076
Just like this fearsome brute!

1335
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:28,119
Yes!

1336
01:59:29,787 --> 01:59:31,831
Here, you can eat him.

1337
01:59:37,003 --> 01:59:39,130
The word "brute"

1338
01:59:40,339 --> 01:59:42,133
originates from the word "the masses."

1339
01:59:43,509 --> 01:59:45,344
Since the masses are all beasts,

1340
01:59:45,428 --> 01:59:48,848
it is only right that they fear us!

1341
01:59:48,931 --> 01:59:51,350
-Yes!
-Yes!

1342
02:00:10,536 --> 02:00:13,247
Forming a community is the best way
to join forces.

1343
02:00:13,331 --> 02:00:16,876
Since the Great Unity failed,
we should find a new name.

1344
02:00:18,628 --> 02:00:19,754
How about Pan-Unity after Beom-dong?

1345
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:23,424
"A world where everyone is united."

1346
02:00:24,091 --> 02:00:26,052
Pan-Unity.

1347
02:00:32,183 --> 02:00:33,684
That sounds great.

1348
02:00:33,768 --> 02:00:35,519
That means I'm the boss?

1349
02:00:36,312 --> 02:00:38,731
Do we really need a boss?

1350
02:00:40,316 --> 02:00:41,776
Let's go!

1351
02:00:42,401 --> 02:00:44,779
Let's go have fun.

1352
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:50,125
