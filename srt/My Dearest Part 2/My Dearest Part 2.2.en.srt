(This drama is a work of fiction
created based on historical facts.)

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,960
(Most of the details and depictions
of the characters are fictional.)

3
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:12,980
(Episode 12)

4
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,329
Hurry up!

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,429
I know it is a common occurrence
to abduct women,

6
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:29,529
insist they are captives,
and drag them away.

7
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,670
But I am still a noblewoman.

8
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,310
The men in your family have been
military officers for generations, right?

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,880
But have you heard?

10
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:42,109
If we do not catch
all the runaway captives,

11
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:45,520
they will drag the King of Joseon
to the Qing Empire.

12
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,089
So, the Joseon Court has been
catching all captives,

13
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,460
no matter their family backgrounds
and their class.

14
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,490
I think I heard them say that anyone
who resists can be killed on the spot.

15
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:59,398
In the midst of all that,
who cares about an officer's wife?

16
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,006
What do you think you are trying to pull?

17
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,729
You better let my lady go this instant...

18
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:04,400
Keep going!

19
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,310
Madam.

20
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:33,969
Kid.

21
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,670
Have you lost your way?

22
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,269
They dragged Madam away.

23
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,180
Is there still no news?

24
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,819
Gil Chae.

25
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,219
Madam.

26
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,828
Have you perhaps...

27
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:07,730
heard anything on your own?

28
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,829
What do you mean by that?

29
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,990
It is not the first time
Lady Gil Chae has disappeared.

30
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,968
Has that man, Lee Jang Hyun, perhaps...

31
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:15,110
Oh, my goodness.

32
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,710
What are you trying to say?

33
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,009
In the past,

34
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,750
she even saw him off in person.

35
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,020
Let us talk in private.

36
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,860
Slow down.

37
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:47,110
Some guys dragged Madam away?

38
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,729
Did they seem like they were strangers?

39
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,780
And did Madam and those men...

40
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,849
seem like they did not know each other?

41
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,158
Hey, what happened?

42
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,189
We could not find her.

43
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,560
Go on and tell him for now.

44
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:22,870
Why do I care?

45
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:27,050
You do not know what she means to me.

46
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,520
What do you mean I tricked you?

47
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,949
I have been looking around for her
all night.

48
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,819
Do I seem to be lying to you?

49
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,289
I do not suspect you.

50
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:41,990
However,

51
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,209
I do wonder if your wife has deceived me
again this time...

52
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,169
and helped my wife leave.

53
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,770
That is why I say so.

54
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:52,639
Is that...

55
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:58,479
how you have been feeling until now?

56
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:03,550
You know...

57
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,449
Gil Chae.

58
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,759
She does not change her mind
once she decides something.

59
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:15,259
You are the man Gil Chae has chosen.

60
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,029
So, how could you doubt Gil Chae...

61
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,339
You.

62
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,839
Some strange men dragged her away?

63
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,610
Yes.

64
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,550
They dragged away...

65
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:43,489
Madam and Jong Jong.

66
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,490
Where to?

67
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:46,819
Where did they drag them off to?

68
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:50,389
They were speaking in the language
of foreign intruders.

69
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:55,300
I have heard that many women
have been getting abducted recently.

70
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,068
This must be...

71
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:58,139
You are...

72
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,509
Lee Jang Hyun's man, are you not?

73
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:12,519
Now, everything has become clear.

74
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:19,319
Officer Gu.

75
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,829
Officer Gu.

76
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,559
Why are you acting like this?

77
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:31,569
I am certain that man, Lee Jang Hyun,
has taken my wife.

78
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:34,469
And he must have made Ryang Eum
take care of the aftermath.

79
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,410
- Officer Gu.
- Then why else...

80
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,579
would that man be the one
to bring news of my wife?

81
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,139
Did you not hear Ryang Eum?

82
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,378
He was walking past this place
by chance when he met Da Jim...

83
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:43,610
By chance?

84
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,459
Do you believe that?

85
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:01,000
Ryang Eum.

86
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,870
I believe you.

87
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,740
And...

88
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,670
I believe this child too.

89
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:11,410
Gil Chae...

90
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,509
You must bring Gil Chae back.

91
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:24,019
Take that man and hit him
until he tells you where my wife is.

92
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,519
- Yes, sir.
- My lord.

93
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:27,629
There is no time for this.

94
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,980
I am certain she has been taken away
by the Qing.

95
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:31,458
Do not delay any longer...

96
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:33,629
and send people to find Madam
before it is too late.

97
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,899
Then,

98
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,670
please send me.

99
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,609
I will find out where she is...

100
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,339
Do you think I would believe your word?

101
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:43,879
I will...

102
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,420
go with Ryang Eum.

103
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:57,019
You do not doubt me as well, do you?

104
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:22,649
Hurry up!

105
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,419
Get up.

106
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,519
Get up now!

107
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,948
Jong Jong.

108
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:56,209
Come to your senses.

109
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,019
Madam.

110
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,079
I am thirsty.

111
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,120
My throat...

112
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:13,399
I have packed some dried meat
and ground grains.

113
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:15,069
Do not skip your meals.

114
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,269
I have also packed you plenty of socks.

115
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,139
Well,

116
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,709
the roads must be harsh.

117
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:24,879
Please take care of yourself, and...

118
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:39,620
Thank you.

119
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,990
Why do you thank me?

120
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:42,360
It is my duty.

121
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,399
If I think of what Lady Yoo did for me...

122
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,970
when I was locked up in prison,

123
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:50,529
I could do even more for her.

124
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,110
Officer Gu.

125
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,779
We are leaving now.

126
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:08,519
Jong Jong.

127
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,659
Jong Jong, come to your senses.

128
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,320
Okay? Come to your senses.

129
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:15,830
I cannot...

130
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:18,029
walk anymore.

131
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,029
They said
it would take over a month to get there.

132
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,299
I cannot do this, Madam.

133
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,870
If you collapse here, I will abandon you.

134
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,669
Then you will be eaten by crows.
Will you like that?

135
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,840
No, however...

136
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,639
I cannot go on anymore.

137
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,379
Jong Jong.

138
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:43,220
Excuse me, sir.

139
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:45,759
Hey.

140
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,259
I have an ornament in here.

141
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:53,629
If you could untie me...

142
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,429
I cannot do that.

143
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,470
Then put your hand in there
and take it out.

144
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,070
My goodness.

145
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:03,008
I cannot dare to touch a noblewoman.

146
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:04,609
It is fine. Hurry up and take it out.

147
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:05,610
Now.

148
00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:20,929
Take it, and let us ride the wagon.

149
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,299
Only one of you can ride it
if this is all you have.

150
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:26,559
I am fine.

151
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,669
Please let her ride the wagon.

152
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,870
You want your servant to ride the wagon?

153
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:33,370
How absurd.

154
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,340
Get on the wagon.

155
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:43,950
Madam.

156
00:10:43,951 --> 00:10:46,350
Hang in there. You can hold out.

157
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,750
Let us go.

158
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:09,940
It suits you.

159
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,008
Well...

160
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:14,610
I thought I should wear it today
for you got me this as a gift.

161
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:16,509
The thing is...

162
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,919
I gave it to Lady Eun Ae as a gift.

163
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,620
I will go and get changed at once.

164
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:31,559
You got this for me, did you not?

165
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:36,799
It truly suits you.

166
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,070
You look beautiful.

167
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,409
Well,
a pretty lady is wearing a pretty dress.

168
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,379
Of course, I look beautiful.

169
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,980
My lady.

170
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,620
You see, you're not bad-looking.

171
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,350
However, I have seen prettier women.

172
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,140
There are many of them, in fact.

173
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,860
Do not say what you do not even mean.

174
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,158
Then why did you not give it
to the prettier woman you have seen?

175
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,629
Why did you gift me this expensive dress?

176
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:11,569
I have never seen or heard of a man
who would do such a thing.

177
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,740
Oh, why did I gift you this silk dress?

178
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:23,080
You see, you are...
From the moment I first saw you...

179
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,690
Never mind.

180
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,230
What? What were you going to say?

181
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:37,830
To me, you are...

182
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:43,928
Never mind.

183
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,440
Just say it. What were you going to say?

184
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,570
Everyone must be waiting.
We should go inside.

185
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,808
Wait.

186
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:52,740
Finish your sentence.

187
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:54,179
What were you going to say?

188
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:55,778
The day we first met... Yes.

189
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:57,479
We met by the swing. What about it?

190
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,379
Come on. What were you going to say?

191
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:00,679
Hey!

192
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,529
I am sorry.

193
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,370
Do you live here?

194
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,690
There is something very peculiar
about the moonlight today, right?

195
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:44,129
And here is a man...

196
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:47,970
admiring the moon all alone
with a bottle of wine in his hand.

197
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,639
Are you a playboy?

198
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,300
You do not seem like a dunderhead.

199
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,279
Are you a troublemaker son
from a wealthy family?

200
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:03,950
You.

201
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,649
What are you?

202
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,950
There is something peculiar
about the moon tonight.

203
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,659
My dear, you must be
under the same moonlight too.

204
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,570
I hope you are having a good night.

205
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,120
I know which route
the Qing people take to go to Simyang.

206
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:21,929
If we are lucky,
we will be able to trace her steps.

207
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:24,299
By the way,

208
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,860
why did you not go with Lee Jang Hyun?

209
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,810
More importantly, what is the reason
you are helping Officer Gu find his wife,

210
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:33,769
knowing that he is suspicious of you?

211
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:39,110
Once, I asked a similar question
to Young Master Jang Hyun.

212
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:44,009
"Why are you risking your life
to help that person?"

213
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,919
"That person?"

214
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:47,649
Who are you talking about?

215
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,190
Young Master Jang Hyun said...

216
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,190
that someone would shed bloody tears...

217
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,929
if that person died or got hurt...

218
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,940
and that he did not want to see that.

219
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,399
My reason is the same.

220
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,409
Start a farm? All of a sudden?

221
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:18,080
Due to the drought,

222
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:21,120
we do not even have enough food
to send to Jinzhou.

223
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,710
Hence, those of you from Joseon...

224
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:25,359
should start a farm
and grow your own food.

225
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,918
It is His Imperial Majesty's order.

226
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,559
What do you mean?

227
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:32,700
You will not feed your hostages?
That is unheard of.

228
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,759
The soil and climate here are
very different from those of Joseon.

229
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:38,639
How could we grow our food here?

230
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:41,039
His Majesty has already given his order,

231
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:43,639
and it must be obeyed.

232
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,620
It does not look like...

233
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,990
they will send us back to Joseon.

234
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,090
Start a farm?

235
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,329
They wish to keep me here
until the day I die.

236
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:09,528
Who wishes to handle this?

237
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,700
I am afraid...

238
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:14,939
I know nothing about farming.

239
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:18,240
We should ask those in Joseon
to send us some farmers.

240
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:21,709
They exhausted their resources
to send the food and the soldiers.

241
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,230
How could I ask for farmers this time?

242
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,349
I know...

243
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:27,279
a little bit about farming.

244
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,650
My father worked for the government
when I was a child,

245
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,489
and I saw my mother
managing the family farm...

246
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,089
with the help of our servants.

247
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,029
It is important that we acquire good land.

248
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,629
To start,

249
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,230
they are giving us a plot of land
that could be plowed in a month.

250
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:44,598
Find someone who knows a lot about soil...

251
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:46,400
and get a fertile plot of land.

252
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:48,910
We must hurry
so we can cultivate the land.

253
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,480
Also,

254
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:55,348
we need some farmers
who can work efficiently.

255
00:17:55,349 --> 00:17:57,180
We can certainly find them.

256
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:02,319
We can find them? Where?

257
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,660
Somewhere very close.

258
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,559
The Joseon men at the slave market...

259
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,430
were all farmers back in Joseon.

260
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:17,940
Your Highness.

261
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,369
Would you like to meet them yourself?

262
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,890
Would you like to turn around and go back?

263
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,190
No.

264
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:39,019
We will keep going.

265
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,200
Spare me!

266
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:51,899
Please do not kill me!

267
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,700
Please stop.

268
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:56,170
- Please spare me.
- Stop!

269
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,640
Please spare me.

270
00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:00,980
Do not kill me!

271
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,250
- Let go!
- Please do not kill me.

272
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,479
- Help!
- Please help us!

273
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,518
- Please get us out of here.
- My lord!

274
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:09,420
- Help!
- Please!

275
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:11,219
- My lord!
- Help us!

276
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,259
My lord!

277
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,199
Please help us!

278
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,399
Look.

279
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,329
The bail amount was 30 nyang,
so I brought it,

280
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,769
but it was suddenly raised to 70 nyang,

281
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:29,910
so I went back to Joseon to get 70 nyang.

282
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,509
It took me half a year
to go back and forth.

283
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,150
And now you are asking me
to pay 100 nyang?

284
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,819
He says 100 nyang is too much.

285
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:43,220
She has been eating
and sleeping during that time!

286
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,319
If this continues,
you will have to pay 150 nyang!

287
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:49,139
He says he will take 150 nyang
if you continue to act like this.

288
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,500
I sold all of my land. I no longer...

289
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,429
have any means of acquiring more money.

290
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,929
Please.

291
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,569
Then she will not be released!

292
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,539
Please.

293
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,339
Set my daughter free.

294
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:06,078
Please set my daughter free.

295
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,209
Please.

296
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:10,109
Why are you keeping her locked up?

297
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,720
Please.

298
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,349
No.

299
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,489
Father,

300
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,160
take back that money.

301
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,359
The kids will starve to death.

302
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:27,160
No, my daughter.

303
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:28,699
No!

304
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,970
My daughter!

305
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:31,769
My daughter.

306
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:44,749
Those who were lucky returned to Joseon,

307
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,019
but those who have not been able
to acquire bail money...

308
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:49,588
and those whose families
have not come yet...

309
00:20:49,589 --> 00:20:51,990
are still waiting for their families here.

310
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:54,759
If we purchase them,

311
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,029
we will be able to use them as farmers.

312
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,999
How are you still thinking
of exploiting them...

313
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,430
after seeing what just happened?

314
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:08,309
They have constantly been here for years.

315
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:11,809
How could I suddenly feel sympathetic
toward them?

316
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,349
They are here.

317
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,950
They are in good condition.

318
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,019
Three Joseon men...

319
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:27,059
and three Joseon women.

320
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:33,959
All her teeth are intact!

321
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,999
Show us.

322
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,469
- Show us!
- Show us!

323
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,900
You want to see?

324
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,309
Show us something else too.

325
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:47,640
Strip her.

326
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,108
Yes, strip her.

327
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:51,650
The best quality.

328
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,119
- Show us.
- Show us!

329
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,088
- Let us see!
- Let us see!

330
00:21:57,089 --> 00:21:58,559
- Let us see!
- Let us see!

331
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,859
- Let us see!
- Let us see!

332
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,299
- Let us see!
- Let us see!

333
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:12,140
Your Highness.

334
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,450
Why did those women...

335
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:27,250
have to stay alive
and suffer such humiliation?

336
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,619
How could Joseon become a laughingstock?

337
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,160
Then how is the King of Joseon...

338
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:40,229
still alive after the humiliation
of bowing to the intruders nine times?

339
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,400
You must be insane!

340
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,740
Why does someone's humiliation
deserve sympathy...

341
00:22:49,609 --> 00:22:51,309
while another's humiliation...

342
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,710
deserves death?

343
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:02,088
I am going to kill you today.

344
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,150
Your Highness!

345
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,759
Your Highness,

346
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:10,490
do you really believe...

347
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:16,569
that those people should have
avoided humiliation by dying?

348
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:21,099
If that is what you really think,

349
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:27,640
you may strike me this instant.

350
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:01,809
Hyun!

351
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:26,470
Hyun!

352
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,609
My sister!

353
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:00,500
Interpreter Lee.

354
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:07,380
Follow me.

355
00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:45,519
I am going to kill you.

356
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,549
But before that,

357
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,519
I must know
why you followed me to Simyang...

358
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:54,930
when you decided
to be disloyal to His Majesty.

359
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:01,630
What is up your sleeve?

360
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,569
Long ago,

361
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:10,109
a person I know...

362
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:15,609
was so afraid of suffering humiliation...

363
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,750
that they chose death.

364
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:26,019
I could not understand their decision.

365
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,960
I was enraged.

366
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,299
You asked me why I came to Simyang.

367
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:37,369
I...

368
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,240
was curious about your fate.

369
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,079
I thought you would end up surrendering.

370
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:49,910
How impudent of you.

371
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:53,150
But you were very strong.

372
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,589
You did great, Your Highness.

373
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:57,049
What is this nonsense?

374
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,460
I...

375
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,959
was not able
to protect the King of Joseon...

376
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,400
There is no law that says
a child must protect his father.

377
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,869
It is the father...

378
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,240
who must protect.

379
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:18,710
Your Highness,

380
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,009
do not forget this.

381
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:27,819
Even if the whole world points its fingers
at you for bowing down to the intruders,

382
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,960
and even if the King of Joseon...

383
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:35,460
doubts your loyalty,

384
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,099
hold out until the end.

385
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:52,509
Once I see that,

386
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,349
it will somewhat comfort my heart
which is full of resentment...

387
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,559
toward the person who gave up on life.

388
00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:33,919
I told you to buy farmers,

389
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,789
not old people on the verge of death.

390
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:38,219
We have no silver. How are we supposed...

391
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,220
to buy young and lively captives?

392
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:42,529
But still, they are too old.

393
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,029
Excuse me,

394
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,960
if we are not good workers,

395
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,559
will you hit us?

396
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:52,339
We have only farmed our whole life.

397
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:55,169
The only thing we know how to do
is farming.

398
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,339
Is that so?

399
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,240
That is wonderful news.

400
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:01,640
Let us go.

401
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,250
How are we supposed to farm...

402
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:11,250
with these old people?

403
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:13,819
Even before I was born,

404
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:15,960
these men have been farming.

405
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:21,130
They must have solutions
to any kind of soil condition.

406
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,470
All right.

407
00:29:23,569 --> 00:29:25,339
Get the farmers into a group of six.

408
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:28,740
Then, select the most experienced farmer
as the leader.

409
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:30,170
And...

410
00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:33,539
how much fabric is left in this office?

411
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,109
We have 220 rolls of cotton and muslin.

412
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,649
Their unlined clothes are unpleasant.

413
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:41,920
Make a pair of pants and a jacket
for these farmers with those fabrics.

414
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:43,619
And...

415
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,160
give them rice for breakfast and dinner.

416
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,529
We will serve lunch for them here.

417
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:51,358
Your Highness.
I have something to inform...

418
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:52,430
How impertinent!

419
00:29:55,369 --> 00:29:57,130
If we successfully raise crops,

420
00:29:58,269 --> 00:30:00,440
will you send us back to our hometowns?

421
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,809
When I die,

422
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:08,880
I wish to die in my hometown.

423
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:23,660
I neither know
when I can return to Joseon.

424
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:26,059
But...

425
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:28,970
I shall promise you this.

426
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,569
If I can return to Joseon,

427
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,470
I promise...

428
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,309
to surely take you all with me.

429
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,740
Did you hear that?

430
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,250
Hurry up.

431
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:54,890
My lady.

432
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,359
This is purely my thought.

433
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,160
We are going to Simyang.

434
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,799
Young Master Jang Hyun could be there.

435
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,630
Do not bring him up.

436
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,440
We must not meet him.

437
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:10,210
Nor must we ask for his help.

438
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,980
We must not.

439
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:47,339
My lady.

440
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,880
(Soong)

441
00:31:55,049 --> 00:31:56,049
(Soongin)

442
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:13,500
(Soongin Valley, Officer Gu Won Moo)

443
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:21,539
(Gil Chae, Simyang)

444
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:37,730
Little boy.

445
00:32:58,650 --> 00:32:59,650
Your Majesty.

446
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:02,750
The report from the subject in Simyang
has arrived.

447
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,359
Yong Gol Dae had scolded them severely...

448
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,759
for twelve matters.

449
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:09,930
Read them to me.

450
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,140
Yong Gol Dae paid a visit...

451
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,539
and spoke of the twelve following matters.

452
00:33:22,509 --> 00:33:24,469
When requisitioning the army
the other day,

453
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,350
the plan got ruined
as the deadline was not met.

454
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,309
The soldiers...

455
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,210
deliberately returned late
on the pretext that...

456
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,779
the ship had sunk in the sea this year.

457
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:38,650
Those who fled were not immediately found
and returned.

458
00:33:39,619 --> 00:33:42,789
Crossing the borders to dig for ginseng
was not banned.

459
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:47,029
My lord, please give us some food.

460
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:49,599
We have been starving for days.

461
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,799
My lord.

462
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,839
My son froze to death
while transferring provisions.

463
00:33:59,609 --> 00:34:00,779
We have nothing.

464
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:30,840
The people...

465
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:34,309
are making rice cakes and porridge
out of soil.

466
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:36,909
It tastes like buckwheat.

467
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,880
Have you had it before?

468
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:47,219
I thought the war was over.

469
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,159
But it was not.

470
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:53,598
Because provisions and soldiers
are sent to the Qing every year,

471
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,199
our kingdom is suffering.

472
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,969
Pyeongan Island is about to be destroyed.

473
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:02,309
I feel the kingdom will go down
at this rate.

474
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:07,610
You know, I...

475
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:12,349
If the traces of foreign intruders
can be wiped from Joseon,

476
00:35:14,349 --> 00:35:15,920
I am more than willing to sell my soul.

477
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,920
How pretty.

478
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,659
Hey, now.

479
00:35:25,699 --> 00:35:27,099
What are you doing?

480
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,340
What does it say?

481
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,949
You heard, did you not?

482
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:51,309
The captives will be coming
from Joseon this time.

483
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,359
But there is a court official
who says he cannot bear to watch...

484
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,429
the captives being punished.

485
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,829
Yes, I will take his place instead.

486
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,999
Will you do that?

487
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,300
What is so hard about that?

488
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,529
It is not like the captives...

489
00:36:06,869 --> 00:36:08,698
will not be punished if I do not watch.

490
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:09,739
That is...

491
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,540
- Get on your knees!
- Get on your knees!

492
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,280
My lady.

493
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,920
You should go down on your knees.

494
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,760
Even the crown princess of Joseon...

495
00:36:25,989 --> 00:36:28,019
had to step out of her palanquin here.

496
00:37:15,269 --> 00:37:16,440
I heard of you.

497
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:18,539
Send me to Joseon too.

498
00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:22,349
All of you...

499
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,250
should be beheaded.

500
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:26,719
However, His Majesty showed mercy.

501
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:28,619
Only...

502
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,719
three will be punished.

503
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:33,920
Cut their heels.

504
00:38:16,929 --> 00:38:18,099
Let us go.

505
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,779
Get up, you punk!

506
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,949
Do not hit him.

507
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,650
Let go of me.

508
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,489
Hurry up and take him away.

509
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,250
I will...

510
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,289
buy this captive.

511
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,450
Since his ankle has been cut off,

512
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:46,698
you do not need him anymore, do you?

513
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:47,860
This punk...

514
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:50,769
is good with his hands,
so his legs do not matter.

515
00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:52,469
He will not be able to...

516
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,539
run away anymore, so that is good.

517
00:38:56,539 --> 00:38:57,710
Take him away now.

518
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,059
His Majesty might like her.

519
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:20,130
Bring her along.

520
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:30,300
Will they notice that we are not captives?

521
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,549
Those two...

522
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,389
will serve His Majesty,
so leave them behind.

523
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:53,219
Take the others back to Joseon...

524
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:55,265
and have them pay 100 nyang
to have each person back.

525
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:56,360
Yes, of course.

526
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,260
You three, get up.

527
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,699
Hurry up!

528
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:04,530
Look here.

529
00:41:04,769 --> 00:41:06,840
Does she recognize
that we are not captives?

530
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:10,369
I no longer...

531
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,239
know anything about it.

532
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:13,679
Come along.

533
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:17,309
Look here.

534
00:41:18,949 --> 00:41:20,179
I am from Joseon as well.

535
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,320
Do as you are told.

536
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:37,929
Change into these.

537
00:41:43,309 --> 00:41:44,710
We are not captives.

538
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,589
Things went wrong,
and we were dragged here.

539
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,750
You are also from Joseon,

540
00:41:49,809 --> 00:41:51,169
so please tell them on our behalf.

541
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,118
Whether someone who was brought here
is a captive or not...

542
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:55,949
is up to His Majesty to decide.

543
00:41:56,789 --> 00:41:58,518
And whether you are a captive or not,
as long as you are here,

544
00:41:58,519 --> 00:41:59,590
just do as you are told.

545
00:42:00,289 --> 00:42:02,089
If not, His Majesty's beloved concubine
with a bad temper might send you off...

546
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:03,559
to the captive market.

547
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:06,428
You do not know what kind of
brutal treatment the captives face...

548
00:42:06,429 --> 00:42:08,130
when they get sold there, do you?

549
00:42:31,489 --> 00:42:32,559
Madam.

550
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:37,129
It might be best to find out
if Interpreter Lee is in Simyang...

551
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,860
Rather than ask him for help,

552
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:40,500
it is better to just die.

553
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,000
Got it?

554
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,610
Please help me.

555
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,789
Come on. Work harder!

556
00:43:43,489 --> 00:43:44,860
- Let us go.
- Gosh.

557
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,400
Push.

558
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,300
Gosh.

559
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,199
Gosh, push.

560
00:43:52,369 --> 00:43:53,570
My goodness.

561
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,039
I said, push.

562
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:57,609
Did you use all your strength...

563
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:59,309
from breakfast on pooping?

564
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,780
Put some strength into it.

565
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:02,309
I am pushing!

566
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:03,969
You are getting on my nerves.

567
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:06,310
- My goodness.
- Out of my way!

568
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:08,380
This is so exhausting.

569
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:13,119
Darn it.

570
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:14,860
Come on!

571
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,690
There is a rock in the ground.

572
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,960
There is a rock in the ground?

573
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,530
Oh, gosh.

574
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:29,300
I think we will need a cow.

575
00:44:29,809 --> 00:44:32,940
Cows do all the fieldwork for farming.

576
00:44:33,179 --> 00:44:35,179
Where are we supposed to get
a cow right now?

577
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:37,178
We can buy Mongolian cows
with cigarettes and ginseng...

578
00:44:37,179 --> 00:44:38,880
instead of silver.

579
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:47,289
I will go.

580
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:49,260
Interpreter Lee.

581
00:44:50,429 --> 00:44:51,909
You have a lot to do here in Simyang.

582
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,599
But finding a cow is
also an important matter.

583
00:45:18,019 --> 00:45:20,059
Please let me serve His Majesty.

584
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:21,260
It is my wish.

585
00:45:22,059 --> 00:45:24,090
Please let me serve His Majesty.

586
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,360
Please let me serve His Majesty.

587
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:46,010
I said it well,
just like how you taught me, right?

588
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:50,920
Hey.

589
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,389
Madam.

590
00:45:58,860 --> 00:45:59,929
Madam.

591
00:46:00,059 --> 00:46:01,230
You dare...

592
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:02,699
to flirt with His Majesty?

593
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:03,769
Drag her in.

594
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:05,868
- Madam!
- What are you doing?

595
00:46:05,869 --> 00:46:07,199
- Madam!
- Let me go!

596
00:46:07,469 --> 00:46:08,500
Madam.

597
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,070
What are you doing?

598
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,908
- Let me go!
- Madam!

599
00:46:11,909 --> 00:46:13,409
- Jong Jong!
- Madam!

600
00:46:13,579 --> 00:46:14,610
Madam!

601
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:18,380
No!

602
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,050
No.

603
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,480
Do you not like it?

604
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:23,849
That is too bad, then.

605
00:46:24,889 --> 00:46:26,019
I will have...

606
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:27,860
your fingers cut off.

607
00:46:29,059 --> 00:46:30,130
No.

608
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:34,199
Madam!

609
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,368
His Majesty has set his sights on her,
so she cannot have any scars.

610
00:46:41,369 --> 00:46:43,840
Punishing runaway captives is up to me.

611
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,579
Was she really captured
while running away?

612
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,719
Four Joseon captives have run away,

613
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,119
and His Majesty is very angry over it.

614
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,910
If you abuse the Joseon captives again,
and they end up running away,

615
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,289
then,

616
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:06,130
His Majesty said he would find out
who is responsible.

617
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:20,280
Madam.

618
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:22,340
Madam.

619
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:25,280
Madam...

620
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:33,159
Madam...

621
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:35,219
Madam.

622
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:38,690
Madam.

623
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:43,098
Goodness.

624
00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:44,269
How foolish.

625
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:47,300
Of course Deul Bun did not teach you
the correct phrase.

626
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:51,940
What you said was,

627
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:54,510
"Please let me serve His Majesty."

628
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:56,280
That is what it meant.

629
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:02,650
Give up.

630
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:06,390
If you do not listen, they will say
they caught you running away...

631
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,989
and cut off...

632
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:11,059
your fingers or toes.

633
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,079
A while ago,

634
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,309
a few Joseon slaves escaped.

635
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,590
However,
I was too scared to leave with them.

636
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
- Excuse me. May I ask you a question?
- Sure.

637
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:55,469
Have you seen this lady by any chance?

638
00:49:06,949 --> 00:49:08,019
You darned witch.

639
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,888
You deliberately got my madam in trouble.

640
00:49:09,889 --> 00:49:11,219
How dare you...

641
00:49:11,789 --> 00:49:13,019
It is already too late.

642
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,559
His Majesty already has
his eyes on your madam.

643
00:49:17,059 --> 00:49:18,289
What do you mean?

644
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:19,699
You know what I mean.

645
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:37,409
Maybe we took a different route.

646
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,619
I was told that
the Qing people always took this route.

647
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,860
Excuse me, here.

648
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:02,670
(Simyang, Gil Chae, Officer Gu Won Moo)

649
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,050
(Simyang, Gil Chae, Officer Gu Won Moo)

650
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:24,329
(Simyang, Gil Chae, Officer Gu Won Moo)

651
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,829
My dear.

652
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:32,400
My dear!

653
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:40,780
(Simyang, Gil Chae, Officer Gu Won Moo)

654
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:42,610
What should we do?

655
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:44,849
What...

656
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:46,880
should I do now?

657
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:51,119
Then...

658
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,550
By now,

659
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:56,119
she must have arrived in Simyang.

660
00:50:58,059 --> 00:51:00,699
They must have dragged her away,
insisting that she was a prisoner.

661
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:01,900
Officer Gu.

662
00:51:03,969 --> 00:51:05,699
We must prepare money
to get her released...

663
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,340
and leave for Simyang right away.

664
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:09,570
Yes.

665
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:11,239
We should.

666
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:13,739
We must.

667
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:16,949
My dear.

668
00:51:22,449 --> 00:51:24,050
You are going to Mongolia to buy cows?

669
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:28,820
While at it, you should also have some fun
with a Mongolian girl with chubby cheeks.

670
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:34,699
"Have some fun?" What do you mean?

671
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:38,530
If you want to forget a woman,
you must meet someone new.

672
00:51:38,869 --> 00:51:40,038
So how exactly...

673
00:51:40,039 --> 00:51:42,400
All right. We should get going.

674
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:44,539
Goodness. What is with you?

675
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:56,150
Sleep, my baby

676
00:51:56,820 --> 00:52:00,960
You are fast asleep, my baby

677
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:05,659
I would not trade you for gold

678
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:10,699
I would not trade you for jade

679
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:24,210
Let us go eat something.

680
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:31,889
This is the perfect chance...

681
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,690
to sell the piles of tobacco we have.

682
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:38,750
Is that why you volunteered to go
to Mongolia without hesitation?

683
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:43,098
With the money we will earn this time,

684
00:52:43,099 --> 00:52:44,979
we can erect some pillars
for the Namwon branch.

685
00:53:50,369 --> 00:53:51,869
This is top-quality tobacco.

686
00:54:16,929 --> 00:54:18,130
Look. There is a woman.

687
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,199
This is good. Mongolian beef.

688
00:54:28,969 --> 00:54:30,139
Stay as long as you want.

689
00:54:30,369 --> 00:54:31,539
Enjoy your time here.

690
00:54:32,739 --> 00:54:33,809
This is delicious.

691
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:15,780
The truth is,

692
00:55:16,989 --> 00:55:18,019
I...

693
00:55:25,929 --> 00:55:27,300
I had a woman.

694
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,670
I hoped...

695
00:55:37,409 --> 00:55:39,670
she would feel the same way as I did.

696
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:44,210
But she said...

697
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:49,750
she had never once loved or trusted me.

698
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:01,860
So I do not like her anymore.

699
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,269
Come to think of it,
she is not even that pretty.

700
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,769
Especially those eyes.

701
00:56:08,469 --> 00:56:09,500
Her eyes are too...

702
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,019
Her eyes are too...

703
00:56:27,159 --> 00:56:28,360
They always sparkled.

704
00:56:33,329 --> 00:56:36,059
She should not have looked at me
with those eyes.

705
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:58,349
Fine.

706
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:03,690
I will do exactly what she did to me.

707
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,460
If we meet again...

708
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:10,199
I will not see her again,

709
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:14,570
but even if we were to meet again,

710
00:57:17,269 --> 00:57:18,789
I will not even look in her direction.

711
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:23,340
See if I stare at her.

712
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:29,449
I keep my word.

713
00:57:52,309 --> 00:57:53,340
All right.

714
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:57,309
Jong Jong, live a good life
for all I care.

715
00:57:58,579 --> 00:58:01,480
Do you think I asked you to come with me
because you were pretty?

716
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,320
You kept following me around,

717
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:08,190
so I said you could if you wanted to.

718
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:10,690
Hey,

719
00:58:11,059 --> 00:58:14,159
find me a pretty Mongolian woman too.

720
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,900
You want to know my type?

721
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,639
First of all, I like women
who are not too tall...

722
00:58:21,769 --> 00:58:23,739
with small and long eyes...

723
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:25,868
who look like they are expressive...

724
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:27,509
and have plump lips.

725
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:29,670
If there is a woman like that,
can you introduce her...

726
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:33,409
Gosh. I just described Jong Jong.

727
00:58:49,329 --> 00:58:50,329
What happened?

728
00:59:07,579 --> 00:59:10,519
If you do not, I am going to look for
Young Master Jang Hyun.

729
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:13,860
Jong Jong.

730
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,760
Do you know
what His Majesty's concubine said?

731
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:21,599
His Majesty has his eyes on you.

732
00:59:21,699 --> 00:59:22,960
Do you not understand...

733
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:24,699
what that means?

734
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:51,230
Strip her.

735
00:59:52,659 --> 00:59:54,059
What are you doing? Let go.

736
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:05,660
You have no scars. You are clean.

737
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:27,290
If you receive His Majesty's affection,

738
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:29,400
you must not forget
how well I treated you.

739
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:35,440
Get her ready.

740
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:43,010
Can you just tell me what she just said?

741
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:45,309
I will not ask you
to help me again. Please.

742
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:50,218
She said your body is clean with no scars,

743
01:00:50,219 --> 01:00:51,939
so you will receive
His Majesty's affection.

744
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,219
Just accept your fate.

745
01:00:55,059 --> 01:00:56,788
If you receive His Majesty's affection,

746
01:00:56,789 --> 01:00:59,489
you can live a better life
than you did in Joseon.

747
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:23,649
You have to give the soft persimmons...

748
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:24,949
and white paper to us first.

749
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,190
Of course.

750
01:01:32,929 --> 01:01:34,630
Master.

751
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,069
We are not allowed to hold
private conversations...

752
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:39,230
with maids from Joseon.

753
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:41,440
Do you happen to know Interpreter Lee?

754
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,039
Or Gu Jam?

755
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:44,369
What?

756
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:46,530
Please let him know that my madam,

757
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:48,179
no Lady Yoo,

758
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:49,980
no...

759
01:01:51,949 --> 01:01:53,880
that Lady Gil Chae is here from Joseon.

760
01:01:55,179 --> 01:01:56,480
Who?

761
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:20,409
I tripped and fell.

762
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,239
How dare you create a scar on your face?

763
01:02:34,789 --> 01:02:37,289
She hurt herself to avoid sleeping
with His Majesty.

764
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:41,129
Though I would like to...

765
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:42,500
whip her until she dies,

766
01:02:43,869 --> 01:02:44,929
I must at least...

767
01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:47,269
demand a price for her body.

768
01:02:48,769 --> 01:02:49,900
Send her...

769
01:02:50,909 --> 01:02:52,039
to Boohoochi.

770
01:03:13,059 --> 01:03:14,530
I warned you multiple times.

771
01:03:18,369 --> 01:03:20,429
You should not have helped Da Jim.

772
01:03:22,099 --> 01:03:24,039
Then you would not have been abducted.

773
01:03:25,139 --> 01:03:26,440
No, if you did not...

774
01:03:26,539 --> 01:03:28,578
let that old man work out our forge...

775
01:03:28,579 --> 01:03:30,280
What did you just say?

776
01:03:32,449 --> 01:03:33,579
Drag them away!

777
01:03:34,179 --> 01:03:35,219
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

778
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:37,619
Jong Jong.

779
01:03:37,789 --> 01:03:38,789
Jong Jong!

780
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:46,090
Where are you taking us?

781
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:49,030
Once I return to Joseon,
I will not let you live.

782
01:03:51,429 --> 01:03:52,570
Shut your mouth.

783
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,769
Do you think
you are still a noblewoman here?

784
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:58,408
Even if...

785
01:03:58,409 --> 01:04:00,408
I were to kill you
and say that I did it...

786
01:04:00,409 --> 01:04:01,679
because you tried to run away,

787
01:04:02,139 --> 01:04:04,179
no one would be able to blame me.

788
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:08,180
If you want to live,
keep your mouth shut and follow me.

789
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:10,590
How annoying.

790
01:04:15,019 --> 01:04:17,929
Father!

791
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:20,559
Father.

792
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:23,030
Father!

793
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:27,130
Father.

794
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:29,769
Please spare me!

795
01:04:36,409 --> 01:04:39,309
Why did you have to do that?

796
01:04:39,409 --> 01:04:41,380
Please.

797
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:45,119
- Father.
- Please stop hitting us.

798
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:47,889
- Yes.
- Father!

799
01:04:48,059 --> 01:04:49,260
- Boohoochi.
- Father!

800
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:52,989
Please spare us!

801
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:58,230
Please spare us!

802
01:04:58,969 --> 01:05:00,030
Father.

803
01:05:03,539 --> 01:05:04,639
You are pretty.

804
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:08,980
- Lock them up.
- Yes, sir.

805
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:15,579
What?

806
01:05:20,289 --> 01:05:21,360
Go inside!

807
01:05:25,889 --> 01:05:28,130
Please look after Father and Je Nam.

808
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:31,799
Do not worry.

809
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,400
I will look after them.

810
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:37,309
Will you be okay on your own?

811
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:40,210
You have helped me enough.

812
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:43,440
I will bring my own wife home.

813
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:46,250
I will get going.

814
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:12,070
You are next.

815
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:19,849
If you allow me
to send a letter to Joseon,

816
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:22,519
my husband will bring silver.

817
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:23,849
What?

818
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:25,650
Your husband will come and get you?

819
01:06:29,989 --> 01:06:31,829
Children have come for their parents,

820
01:06:32,389 --> 01:06:34,500
parents have come for the children,

821
01:06:36,429 --> 01:06:38,630
and even wives have come
for their husbands,

822
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:42,039
but no husband has ever come here
looking for his wife.

823
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:09,130
We have goods for you!

824
01:07:21,710 --> 01:07:23,110
They say he was an only son.

825
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:25,909
Someone from Joseon
might come to buy him at a high price.

826
01:07:29,619 --> 01:07:31,939
Even if we use her to our hearts' content
and sell her off,

827
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:36,519
it is a profitable business!

828
01:07:38,190 --> 01:07:39,630
Bidding starts at 30 nyang.

829
01:07:43,699 --> 01:07:44,699
An epidemic!

830
01:07:44,969 --> 01:07:46,070
It is smallpox!

831
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:54,239
- It is an epidemic!
- An epidemic!

832
01:07:54,579 --> 01:07:55,780
It is an epidemic!

833
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:57,750
- An epidemic!
- An epidemic!

834
01:07:58,550 --> 01:07:59,650
An epidemic!

835
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:17,399
Catch them!

836
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,640
My lady! Please run!

837
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:31,409
The cows were sent to the farmers, yes?

838
01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:33,710
Yes. Do not worry.

839
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:35,350
That aside,

840
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:38,419
how could you struggle to get along
with the daughter...

841
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:40,189
of the cow owner that much?

842
01:08:41,859 --> 01:08:44,060
Who are you saying struggled badly?

843
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:45,759
I remember you going on about...

844
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,659
remaining single and preying on ladies.

845
01:08:48,130 --> 01:08:50,829
Is it that hard to communicate
with ladies now?

846
01:08:52,229 --> 01:08:53,869
Communicate, my foot.

847
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:56,229
Is it because things did not go well
with Lady Gil Chae?

848
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,839
Is that so upsetting and heartbreaking...

849
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:00,710
that even your thing has shriveled up?

850
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,149
What has shriveled up?

851
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:07,310
No matter how much I look,
you have become strange.

852
01:09:07,779 --> 01:09:09,020
Young Rang was right.

853
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:10,419
He must be a eunuch.

854
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:12,189
Hey. Do you have a death wish?

855
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:34,640
Shall we warm up?

856
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:42,020
Those bunches are busy even today.

857
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,279
How have you been?

858
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,430
It has been a while.

859
01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:29,960
(My Dearest)

860
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:16,439
Those people have chosen to live.

861
01:12:16,699 --> 01:12:18,509
Your desperation...

862
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:20,739
makes me reluctant to make the deal.

863
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:22,840
Is there something you need?

864
01:12:23,210 --> 01:12:25,149
Give me your time.

865
01:12:25,479 --> 01:12:26,810
I came to tell you something.

866
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:28,419
Lady Gil Chae...

867
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:29,649
I mean, Lady Yoo...

868
01:12:29,979 --> 01:12:31,818
I keep seeing things.

869
01:12:31,819 --> 01:12:34,419
Your husband came to get you.

870
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:36,390
- My lady.
- My lord.

871
01:12:36,859 --> 01:12:38,488
There is nothing to worry about.

872
01:12:38,489 --> 01:12:39,529
Let us go.

873
01:12:42,729 --> 01:12:44,729
