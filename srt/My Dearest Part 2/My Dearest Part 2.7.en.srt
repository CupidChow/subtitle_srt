1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,310
(This drama is a work of fiction
created based on historical facts.)

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,980
(Most of the details and depictions
of the characters are fictional.)

3
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:07,280
(Episode 17)

4
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:19,820
Goodness.

5
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:37,579
May I take a few of these daggers,

6
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:40,750
just in case?

7
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:42,979
What...

8
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:45,149
do you mean by that?

9
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,289
Yes.

10
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:58,429
When I was in Simyang,
I was sold to a foreign intruder...

11
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,829
and had to suffer utter humiliation.

12
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:09,269
I also met Lord Lee Jang Hyun there.

13
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:12,540
I was released, thanks to his help.

14
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,819
What the intruders did to me...

15
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,250
That was not my fault.

16
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,319
Had you wanted to divorce me
because of that,

17
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:26,519
I would not have backed down,
no matter what.

18
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,260
However...

19
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:36,530
In Simyang, I gave my heart to Lord Lee.

20
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,969
For that, I am sorry.

21
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,609
That is why I am divorcing you.

22
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:04,859
Madam.

23
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,099
Thank you for everything.

24
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,129
Gil Chae.

25
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:44,300
No. You cannot go.

26
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,240
You cannot go anywhere now.

27
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:48,069
Let me go.

28
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:51,780
If I stay here,

29
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,280
I will be a blemish
when Young Chae gets married,

30
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,379
when Je Nam takes his state exams,

31
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,949
and to Officer Nam as well.

32
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,449
I will leave Father in your care
for a while.

33
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,620
In return,

34
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,490
I will take care of this child.

35
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,500
No.

36
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,000
Do not go.

37
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,830
I will live well.

38
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,669
I will live well,

39
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,009
and I will repay the kindness
of the person...

40
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:22,870
who saved me by risking his own life.

41
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,810
I will get in touch when I get settled.

42
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,120
Let us go.

43
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:36,789
Do not go, Gil Chae.

44
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,490
Gil Chae, do not go.

45
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,229
Gil Chae, do not go!

46
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,509
Is this it?

47
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,180
Why?

48
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,280
I sold every wedding gift I got
to buy this house.

49
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,819
Let us eat some food.

50
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,319
I was always worried about my later years.

51
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,590
I like this house.

52
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:15,259
Do you like it?

53
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:25,199
Now,

54
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:27,339
how will we live?

55
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:30,170
- I know, right?
- I know, right?

56
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,920
Treason?

57
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:42,920
Treason?

58
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,129
Sim Ki Won committed treason?

59
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,629
According to the records,

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,100
Sim Ki Won spent thousands of nyang...

61
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,899
to have liquor made
and cattle slaughtered.

62
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:59,040
He gathered 70 or so strong men
to the mountain behind his house...

63
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,300
and had them practice archery...

64
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,509
to plan for the future.

65
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:08,509
Do you mean Sim Ki Won has been
training a private army in secret?

66
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,819
Did he intend
to sit on this throne himself?

67
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,990
That is not true.

68
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,420
Then,

69
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,720
who did he intend to serve as his king?

70
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:21,829
At first,

71
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,569
he wanted to have the Crown Prince
from Simyang become king,

72
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:31,870
but he changed his mind
and wanted Prince Hoe Eun instead.

73
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,470
(Prince Hoe Eun:
King Seongjong's great-great-grandson)

74
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,160
We are tracking down
everyone in Sim Ki Won's family.

75
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,629
Those who have fled...

76
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:02,899
Interrogate the governor of Uiju.

77
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,939
The governor of Uiju?
He has nothing to do with this.

78
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,540
Why...

79
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,009
The governor of Uiju...

80
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,410
covered up the fact
that the Crown Prince...

81
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,009
had traveled with hundreds of captives.

82
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,350
What does His Majesty wish to do?

83
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,220
He suspects the Crown Prince.

84
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,220
Goodness.

85
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:27,389
That is a given.

86
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,800
Why does he suddenly want
to punish the governor of Uiju?

87
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,500
I believe His Majesty...

88
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,829
is afraid of the captives
who are loyal to the Crown Prince.

89
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,769
Why would he be afraid of lowly captives?

90
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:40,339
I wonder too.

91
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,649
Who ordered you to bury the cursed objects
throughout the palace?

92
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,519
Who is the person
you were trying to curse?

93
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,560
I do not know.

94
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:04,129
I know nothing about it.

95
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,949
They are looking for the person
behind the cursed objects...

96
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:27,420
buried in the palace.

97
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,319
The person behind it?

98
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,819
If you do not believe me,

99
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:33,889
the Department of Justice recently
executed a court maid by poison...

100
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,360
under the orders
of the Palace Supply Bureau,

101
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,500
so you can check.

102
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,800
The Palace Supply Bureau
ordered them to do it?

103
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:44,500
How could an order to execute an offender
by poison...

104
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,899
be issued by the Palace Supply Bureau,
not the Royal Secretariat?

105
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:50,139
I suppose there is a reason
the Department of Justice...

106
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,110
cannot officially interrogate them.

107
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,310
I have nothing more to tell you.

108
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,319
I received an anonymous tip from someone.

109
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:06,490
Many court ladies are being interrogated
at the moment,

110
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,889
and I heard a number of them died
while being tortured.

111
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,500
The King has become cruel.

112
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:21,939
A great calamity...

113
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:25,079
is bound to befall this country.

114
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,639
(Hwabyeon: A great calamity)

115
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:31,220
His Majesty is afraid.

116
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,990
Do you know this?

117
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,289
When a man is afraid,
his cruelty reveals itself.

118
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,009
So...

119
00:08:56,409 --> 00:08:57,710
once you are back in Joseon,

120
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,519
forget all your sufferings in Simyang...

121
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,120
and live a good life.

122
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:16,259
A flashy...

123
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:21,129
and glamorous one.

124
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,139
Be you, Gil Chae.

125
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:29,909
I am sorry...

126
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,840
for not being able to live such a life.

127
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:06,679
You are...

128
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,679
I suppose you are here to die too.

129
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:11,149
Hold my hand.

130
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,889
If you were going to do this anyway,

131
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,960
why did you not let me die that day?

132
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,500
I am here to get water.

133
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,330
Are you here to take your own life?

134
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,740
Yes.

135
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,039
I wish to die.

136
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,580
I barely managed to return home
in one piece,

137
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,950
but my family kicked me out
saying I humiliated them.

138
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,250
I should have just died back then.

139
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,350
Fine.

140
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,320
Do as you wish.

141
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,490
But die somewhere else.

142
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:00,799
Must you do this here, knowing
everyone in the village uses this well?

143
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:04,269
Jong Jong.

144
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:16,950
Why not have some food before you die?

145
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:24,889
The thief is here.

146
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:26,259
What?

147
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:30,429
So it was you. Finally, I caught you.

148
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:31,429
Let go.

149
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,029
- You brat.
- Darn it. Let go of me!

150
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:34,029
No.

151
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,700
How could you grab hot rice
with your bare hands?

152
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,870
If you want food,
go and gather some firewood.

153
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,980
Then I will give you a bowl of rice.

154
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,049
- You are lying.
- No, I am not.

155
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:52,019
But if you get caught
while stealing food again,

156
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:54,149
I really will scold you.

157
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:55,350
Stop lying.

158
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:06,500
What are those?

159
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,840
Oh, I made these.

160
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:13,940
I took a few with me
when I divorced my husband.

161
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:20,740
What can I do
to sell this for a high price?

162
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:23,379
How will we put food on the table
after selling all these?

163
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,750
Give me food.

164
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,360
Give me food.

165
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,519
You promised to give me food.

166
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,429
Hurry up and give me food.

167
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:40,259
If you give me a bowl of rice,

168
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,970
I will share it with my friends.

169
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,509
I am hungry.

170
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,490
Where are your parents?

171
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,850
They are all dead.

172
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,320
The foreign intruders killed my parents.

173
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:09,159
Mine too.

174
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:13,460
You? I told you that was not true.

175
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:16,129
Your mom will come back for you.
I am sure of it.

176
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:19,039
You are lying.

177
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,179
Seung A, give the kids more food.

178
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,509
What?

179
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:29,179
Okay.

180
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:30,309
Chew well.

181
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,320
You must be hungry.

182
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:35,950
I will give you more food.

183
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,820
Here, we have more rice.

184
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,789
Eat up.

185
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,909
I will never play Go with you again.

186
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:07,590
You have said that 128th times.

187
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,889
This time, I truly mean it.

188
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,919
I enjoy playing Go with Your Highness.

189
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:17,659
You enjoy playing with me?

190
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,830
Then how about...

191
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,429
you serve me in bed tonight?

192
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,070
How could I not enjoy your company
when you make me laugh like this?

193
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,419
You.

194
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,659
A while back,
you said I reminded you of someone.

195
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,159
Did you think of that woman
while looking at me just now?

196
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:57,429
Or...

197
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:03,409
Come along.

198
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,409
This time, we will play a game I can win.

199
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,110
Let us do this.

200
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:13,049
If I win, you will stay by my side
for the rest of your life.

201
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,149
As you know,
the king regent treats me very well.

202
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,990
I can help you live a comfortable life
until the day you die.

203
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:24,059
Then what will I receive as a reward
if I win?

204
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:26,460
That will not happen.

205
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:29,769
Qing will conquer the mainland soon.

206
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:33,669
Then the Joseon people must obey the Qing.

207
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,570
The same...

208
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:38,009
goes for you as well.

209
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:45,879
Did you see that?

210
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,179
What are you doing?

211
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,779
I am a merchant.

212
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,190
I return what I was given.

213
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,960
He who helps me profit...

214
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,259
gets a bigger profit.

215
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,389
He who causes me a loss...

216
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,669
suffers a greater loss
and that was my principle so far.

217
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:36,629
Naturally,

218
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,539
she who shot an arrow at me...

219
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,009
deserves to get shot back.

220
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,009
You evil,

221
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,039
selfish,

222
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:51,779
and foolish wench.

223
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,049
Because of you...

224
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,690
Lee Jang Hyun.

225
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:04,430
It is so strange.

226
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,730
Was I so angry...

227
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:15,539
that I thought too much?

228
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:35,430
What does that mean?

229
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:38,730
Are you angry with me...

230
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,470
or did you think a lot of me?

231
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:03,920
Lee Jang Hyun.

232
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,289
Stop where you are.

233
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:06,720
Stop.

234
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:17,130
She is a crazy thing.

235
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,539
How dare a broad demand
to be made a first-rank prince?

236
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,640
She still thinks her father is an emperor.

237
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:23,339
How long will Dorgon...

238
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:26,440
keep her close when her father
buried his mother alive?

239
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:30,210
If she keeps this up,
she will be sold to Mongolia soon.

240
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:32,519
Once she is married off there,

241
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:34,990
no one will care if she dies
or is kicked out.

242
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,619
Her ex-husband
slept with her just once, I heard.

243
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:46,329
I will not...

244
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,029
dirty my hands with their blood.

245
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,299
Tell the king regent
and he will kill them for me.

246
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,809
What?

247
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:03,349
Now that I have lost my royal connections,

248
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:05,549
do you think less of me too?

249
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,119
Do not look down on me.

250
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,089
The king regent still needs me,

251
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,559
and I still...

252
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,589
have enough power
to kill the likes of you.

253
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,200
Your Highness.

254
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,200
The reason I stayed by your side.

255
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:28,170
It was not out of fear.

256
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:29,369
Then what?

257
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,079
Was it out of pity or charity?

258
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:37,849
Like how you help the prisoners?

259
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:39,579
Whatever they say,

260
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,150
you are still who you are.

261
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:44,319
I am me?

262
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,660
Evil,

263
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:49,089
foolish,

264
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,700
and selfish?

265
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,059
Yes.

266
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,900
That is what you are.

267
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,269
Foolish...

268
00:20:03,339 --> 00:20:04,809
and selfish.

269
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,079
But therefore...

270
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:19,619
Therefore what?

271
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,170
Your Highness.

272
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:09,609
- I am...
- Stop.

273
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,210
I will not hear it.

274
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,690
Before, you pushed me away.

275
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,289
Today, you hesitated.

276
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:27,789
One day, you will hold me.

277
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,829
Dorgon will soon send the Crown Prince
back to Joseon for good.

278
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,269
You will remain, yes?

279
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,140
No.

280
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:44,009
You must remain.

281
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,289
Is that true?

282
00:21:58,019 --> 00:21:59,589
Yes, Your Highness.

283
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,259
I congratulate you...

284
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,660
on your return to Joseon.

285
00:22:13,069 --> 00:22:14,170
Your Highness.

286
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:24,849
Congratulations, Your Highness.

287
00:22:25,349 --> 00:22:28,950
- Congratulations, Your Highness.
- Congratulations, Your Highness.

288
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,190
- Congratulations, Your Highness.
- Congratulations, Your Highness.

289
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:36,059
- Congratulations, Your Highness.
- Congratulations, Your Highness.

290
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,900
- Congratulations, Your Highness.
- Congratulations, Your Highness.

291
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,380
Your Majesty.

292
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:07,119
Come in.

293
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:14,829
Your Majesty.

294
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:16,660
The Qing emperor will send...

295
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,329
the Crown Prince back to Joseon.

296
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,680
Farming must suit you well.

297
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:38,519
- Goodness.
- That old man.

298
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,950
He bought seven plots of farmland
with his lifetime savings.

299
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:44,960
He was taken
before he sowed his first crop.

300
00:24:45,589 --> 00:24:47,390
His wish is to farm his land...

301
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,990
for just one year before he dies.

302
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,089
It looks like...

303
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,400
he stands no chance.

304
00:24:56,069 --> 00:24:57,869
He can go back to Joseon.

305
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:00,869
Yang Chun.

306
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:05,009
The Crown Prince will return to Joseon.

307
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,339
He will...

308
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,809
take all of us with him.

309
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,079
What?

310
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,359
Everyone!

311
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,059
The Crown Prince will return to Joseon!

312
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:24,460
- What?
- You all...

313
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,660
can go home too!

314
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,200
- Really?
- Is that true?

315
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:29,329
That is great!

316
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,339
Yes! Goodness.

317
00:25:33,769 --> 00:25:35,869
- We are going home!
- Yes!

318
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,240
We are going home!

319
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,940
It is now over!

320
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,380
Goodness, this is great!

321
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,019
How amazing is this?

322
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,230
The food tastes great.

323
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,630
(Father, it will not be long
until I can see you again.)

324
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,670
Jang Hyun.

325
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,440
I hear everyone is going to Joseon.

326
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,440
Yes.

327
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,839
I feel so relieved.

328
00:26:14,109 --> 00:26:15,150
All of these people...

329
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,180
are going to Joseon, thanks to you.

330
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:21,049
No, I did not do anything.

331
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,990
It is all thanks to you.

332
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,960
Jang Hyun usually does not care
about anyone else.

333
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:28,220
You were whining so much
that he helped out all these captives.

334
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:31,589
Thanks to that, the Namwon branch
of Usimjeong has been delayed,

335
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:34,029
so if you think about it,
the fact that I am not rich yet...

336
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:36,299
is because you were so nosy.

337
00:26:37,769 --> 00:26:39,440
If I had become rich already,

338
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,170
Jong Jong would not have gone back
like that so easily.

339
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:44,210
Now, when the Namwon branch opens,

340
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,279
all of the Joseon women will...

341
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:49,680
Yes, clean all of this up.

342
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:56,220
Seriously, he does not care
about me at all.

343
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:59,420
What do you mean,
we cannot take the captives to Joseon?

344
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:01,519
Do you recall
when His Majesty in Joseon...

345
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,259
punished the governor of Uiju?

346
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,329
When you were making a journey to Joseon,

347
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,670
you brought along hundreds of captives
who had been released on national funds.

348
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,970
The governor of Uiju had not reported
this fact on time.

349
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,269
Because of the captives
that I brought along,

350
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,480
the governor was punished?

351
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,049
Yes, Your Highness.

352
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,750
So,

353
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:29,089
other than the 150 or so farmers
that have been already reported,

354
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:32,660
the other hundreds of captives
that you purchased personally...

355
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:36,990
will not be allowed back to Joseon.

356
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,660
No.

357
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:44,299
I made a promise with those people.

358
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,869
That I would take them with me
when I went to Joseon, no matter what.

359
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:50,369
Your Highness.

360
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:52,839
You must not take the captives.

361
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,450
His Majesty in Joseon does not want it.

362
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:57,579
Your Highness.

363
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,349
Leave the captives behind?

364
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:06,759
What are you talking about?

365
00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:12,029
I do not mean they will stay here forever.
I mean we will come back for them later.

366
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,569
What do you mean by later?

367
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:20,170
His Highness is going back
to Joseon for good.

368
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:22,910
Unless they follow along this time,
these captives...

369
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,140
will not have any promise...

370
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,579
of returning to Joseon.

371
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:30,880
His Majesty...

372
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,650
does not want the captives who were
kept by His Highness in Simyang...

373
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,750
to come back to Joseon.

374
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,119
He must be mistaken about something.

375
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,630
Let us trust His Highness and wait.

376
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:44,559
Once he returns to Joseon,

377
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,000
I am sure His Highness will resolve
His Majesty's misunderstanding.

378
00:28:50,869 --> 00:28:52,839
What? They will abandon us?

379
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:54,769
What do you mean by abandon?

380
00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:57,440
His Highness is not someone to do that.

381
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,480
Gosh, Lee Jang Hyun.

382
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,150
Since when did you take the side
of royalty?

383
00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:04,250
I am not taking sides.

384
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:07,750
Just sit down for now, will you?

385
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:13,690
Yang Chun.

386
00:29:15,089 --> 00:29:16,789
Without the cooperation
of the Joseon court,

387
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:18,500
even if they cross the river,

388
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:21,359
they will be dragged back to Qing.

389
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:27,369
Among those who are here with us,
some have not been officially released...

390
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,170
and others have run away.

391
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:31,980
So, Yang Chun,

392
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,779
go back to Joseon with me for now.

393
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:41,119
And when His Highness gets permission
later on,

394
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:43,450
I will take responsibility...

395
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:46,890
and bring back the other captives.

396
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:48,930
I will stay behind too.

397
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:52,059
- Yang Chun.
- Think about it.

398
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:55,930
They even take perfectly fine people
and insist they are captives.

399
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:57,730
With His Highness gone,

400
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:00,200
do you think the remaining Joseon people
in Simyang will be all right?

401
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,140
They will insist people
are runaway captives...

402
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,309
and drag them away.
How will anyone stop that?

403
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,940
If they get caught again,
have their ears...

404
00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:09,710
and heels cut off, and end up dying?

405
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:14,950
Then, I will stay behind.

406
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:18,019
- So, you should...
- That is not right.

407
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:19,759
You should go...

408
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:23,630
and make sure to get
His Highness' promise.

409
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:27,660
I will stay here and take good care
of the captives.

410
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,900
You should go to Joseon
and get His Highness' promise.

411
00:30:33,869 --> 00:30:36,769
You will not abandon me, will you?

412
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:45,779
If everyone leaves,

413
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,920
what about us?

414
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,519
They are leaving all of us behind?

415
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,220
I knew this would happen.

416
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,690
When can we go back, then?

417
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,359
Did you not say they would take all of us?

418
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:57,529
- Be quiet.
- Yes, hush.

419
00:30:57,529 --> 00:30:59,700
- Hush.
- Now is not the time to hush.

420
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,259
- What are we supposed to do?
- Quiet!

421
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:07,940
You may not trust the Crown Prince,
but you trust Lee Jang Hyun, do you not?

422
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,170
I trust Lee Jang Hyun.

423
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,880
So, I will stay behind as well.

424
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:17,750
I will stay behind
and go back with all of you.

425
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,650
I will make sure to take you,

426
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,490
your children, your brothers and sisters,

427
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:26,420
and your parents...

428
00:31:29,529 --> 00:31:32,500
back to Joseon.

429
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,769
- If you are staying behind, it is fine.
- Of course.

430
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,569
- Gosh, that is a relief.
- I thought he would leave too.

431
00:31:38,569 --> 00:31:40,099
- It is all fine now.
- It sure is.

432
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:41,569
- We will put our trust in you.
- Yes, we will.

433
00:31:41,569 --> 00:31:43,170
- What a relief, right?
- Yes.

434
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:44,869
- He will stay with us.
- Right.

435
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:47,210
- It will be fine.
- That is right.

436
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:48,339
- This is great.
- Yes, it is.

437
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:57,990
Greetings, Your Highness.

438
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:00,220
You have decided to stay behind, right?

439
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,029
You will go?

440
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,769
That woman has already gone back
to her husband.

441
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,440
Yes.

442
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:18,140
I also do not plan on loitering around
a married woman...

443
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:22,049
and becoming a hassle for her.

444
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,410
So,

445
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,579
if you like,

446
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:31,089
I will stay by your side.

447
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:33,890
However,

448
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,329
I have a request.

449
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,539
I hear you were kicked out
by your husband.

450
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:52,309
Actually, I left of my own accord.

451
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:55,710
But since no one believes me,
I just let them think so.

452
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:58,880
That is similar to me.

453
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:02,920
Whenever anything goes badly
in the palace, everyone blames me for it.

454
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,460
I cannot be bothered,
so I just leave them be.

455
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,589
Right.
How much will you sell this dagger for?

456
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:12,259
That dagger was...

457
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,000
engraved after our master blacksmith
had a dream...

458
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,369
about receiving a peach
from the three deities of childbirth.

459
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:21,200
Any woman with that dagger will give birth
to 12 healthy sons.

460
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,710
- It is a magical...
- How hard you work to make a living.

461
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:25,940
I am sure you must.

462
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,809
Who would buy a dagger sold by a woman...

463
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:31,309
who was humiliated by an intruder?

464
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,220
Fine.

465
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:37,519
I will pay a high price for it.

466
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,329
But there is something you must do for me.

467
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,059
Soon, the Crown Prince will be coming back
to Joseon for good.

468
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:50,200
That is why I say this.

469
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,640
Is the Crown Prince...

470
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:56,740
coming back to Joseon?

471
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,210
Royal Concubine Cho gave you work to do?

472
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:02,950
What kind of work?

473
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:08,150
He told me to live well
in a flashy and glamorous way.

474
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:11,550
I will never show him
that I am living like this.

475
00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:14,320
What?

476
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,389
The Crown Prince is coming.

477
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,059
Then, Interpreter Lee
and Gu Jam will also...

478
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:28,869
Make way!

479
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:30,340
Make way
for His Highness, the Crown Prince!

480
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,860
See?

481
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:55,699
He did not come.

482
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,599
Qing's princess has her eyes on him,

483
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,739
so he can live
a very comfortable life there.

484
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,940
Why would he come here?

485
00:35:04,739 --> 00:35:05,840
Wait and see.

486
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,079
Someday, Lee Jang Hyun...

487
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,579
will be mine.

488
00:35:12,949 --> 00:35:14,079
You are right.

489
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:17,489
I suppose he is not coming, at last.

490
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,989
Gu Jam.

491
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:00,360
You are here.

492
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,170
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

493
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:15,139
- Your Highness the Crown Princess.
- Your Highness the Crown Princess.

494
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,699
Mother.

495
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:34,599
Father.

496
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,539
Come to me.

497
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:57,019
His Highness is smiling.

498
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,760
Are you happy to be back in Joseon?

499
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,469
Must you ask?

500
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,969
This is where I grew up.

501
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,949
This palace is like my hometown.

502
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:48,170
Everyone gets excited
when they are visiting their hometown.

503
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,539
I do not have a hometown,

504
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,409
so I did not think
I would have a place to go.

505
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,420
But I, too, had a place I missed...

506
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:02,320
and wanted to return to.

507
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:10,989
Sweet dreams.

508
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,210
You will stay up all night,
trying to scoop out water.

509
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,010
Were you happy after you ditched me?

510
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:31,980
Gu Jam.

511
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,449
You did not return,
so I came here to see you.

512
00:38:43,289 --> 00:38:44,630
Goodness. Why are you crying?

513
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,500
Why did you leave
if you were going to cry?

514
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,230
I do not know.

515
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:50,869
You have no idea how I feel.

516
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,900
You have no clue.

517
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,500
Yes, go ahead and hit me.

518
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:57,610
Hit me all you want,
as much as you missed me.

519
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:03,210
I just saw Jong Jong.

520
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,610
She said
Lady Yoo no longer worked at the forge.

521
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:09,050
But she must go out for walks.

522
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,460
We do not have much time.
You should hurry.

523
00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:15,829
What are you talking about?
We just arrived in Joseon.

524
00:39:16,389 --> 00:39:18,460
I must return to Qing, so...

525
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:22,699
Anyway,

526
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:26,500
I have to meet her soon
to make sure she is doing well,

527
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,469
so try to arrange something
through Jong Jong.

528
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,210
That will be hard. I already told you.

529
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,309
Ever since the foreign intruders invaded,

530
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:34,579
they have been keeping a watchful eye
on all the women.

531
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,750
Especially noblewomen.

532
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,519
Then I shall take matters
into my own hands.

533
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,760
What? My goodness.

534
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:19,289
How did you find out...

535
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:21,420
that I lived here?

536
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:25,530
You must know that
Lord Lee is back in Joseon at the moment.

537
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:30,769
Would you like to meet him?

538
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,469
Do you want me...

539
00:40:35,739 --> 00:40:36,909
to meet him?

540
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:39,510
No, I do not.

541
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:41,480
However,

542
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,210
Lord Lee would like to see you.

543
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:46,320
That being said,

544
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:50,050
I suggest you go and see him first.

545
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:53,659
I will not do that.

546
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,260
You do not want him to see that...

547
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:58,659
you now live in a place like this, do you?

548
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,440
It is only a matter of time
before he finds where you live.

549
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,610
So go and meet him.

550
00:41:11,309 --> 00:41:13,380
Show him that you are doing well.

551
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:17,610
Only then will he give up and move on.

552
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:26,619
I do not see a single noblewoman anywhere.

553
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:31,690
That is Jong Jong.

554
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,000
Jong Jong.

555
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,130
Gu Jam.

556
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,639
- What are you doing?
- Here, look.

557
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,010
What are you doing here?

558
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:19,170
So?

559
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,880
Did you meet other women in Simyang?

560
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:25,010
Well, there were many women
who fancied me.

561
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:27,719
They call me the Club of Joseon, you know.

562
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:30,849
But...

563
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,389
I like to keep things simple.

564
00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:39,900
Let go!

565
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:42,530
You see, I had my fortune read.

566
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,130
They said I would go on to make big money.

567
00:42:46,969 --> 00:42:49,710
You had better not let me go.
Hold on to me tightly.

568
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:57,210
I have been stuck in my room every day,
being treated like a queen.

569
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:58,980
So I have been bored out of my mind.

570
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:02,050
Officer Gu is so overprotective of me.

571
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:04,750
He will not even let me walk or stand up
without his permission.

572
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:08,320
So I told him I had to visit my father
to leave the house.

573
00:43:10,429 --> 00:43:11,460
My dear baby.

574
00:43:11,929 --> 00:43:13,699
I had to lie today.

575
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:15,460
Pretend you heard nothing.

576
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:21,940
What about you?

577
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,309
How have you been?

578
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,340
I know
Qing's princess is obsessed with you,

579
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:29,750
so I did not think
you would return to Joseon.

580
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:34,380
I have to go back to Qing soon.

581
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:37,190
This time,

582
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:40,289
I returned for I wanted
to visit my hometown for a short while.

583
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:42,360
I did not know this,

584
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:44,230
but turns out,

585
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:45,929
I have a hometown too.

586
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:54,300
Are you all right?

587
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:58,070
This is not good.

588
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,409
I shall call some palanquin bearers...

589
00:43:59,409 --> 00:44:00,510
Gosh, no.

590
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:03,050
I told you I wanted to take a walk.

591
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:06,780
Also, I had a bad craving
for those rice cakes with beans.

592
00:44:06,849 --> 00:44:08,150
What? Rice cakes...

593
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,019
with beans?

594
00:44:11,019 --> 00:44:12,090
Yes.

595
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:14,789
When you make it at home,

596
00:44:14,789 --> 00:44:16,289
it never tastes like the ones you buy.

597
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:21,030
Jong Jong went to buy rice cakes.
What is taking her so long?

598
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:25,800
Jong Jong?

599
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,199
Where did she go?

600
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,440
Wait here.

601
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,340
I will find Gu Jam and Jong Jong.

602
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:33,539
What?

603
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:35,409
- Jong Jong.
- My lord.

604
00:44:37,179 --> 00:44:38,409
Jong Jong!

605
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,079
- Hello.
- Welcome.

606
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,849
- You made it.
- Come on over.

607
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,090
Rice cakes.

608
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:49,119
- Buy rice cakes.
- Look.

609
00:44:49,659 --> 00:44:51,630
- Goodness.
- They are good.

610
00:45:02,969 --> 00:45:06,809
Gu Jam and Jong Jong
must be getting up to no good.

611
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:08,780
I could not find them anywhere.

612
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,750
Well, this is...

613
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:15,980
On the way back I met an old lady...

614
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:20,289
selling rice cakes,
so how about you have some?

615
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:45,650
Yes.

616
00:45:46,179 --> 00:45:47,320
This is the taste I missed.

617
00:45:48,949 --> 00:45:50,190
Drink some rice punch.

618
00:45:58,429 --> 00:45:59,500
It is so refreshing.

619
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,730
You should have some too.

620
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,039
Do not mind me. It is all for you.

621
00:46:14,179 --> 00:46:16,380
Yes, put that down.

622
00:46:17,449 --> 00:46:18,980
I will eat some more, then.

623
00:46:31,059 --> 00:46:33,730
Why did you stop working at the forge?

624
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:37,429
You must know why.

625
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:40,940
Since I returned from the Qing,

626
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,340
I rarely go outside.

627
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:46,239
I have no choice.

628
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:51,210
My husband said
he would send me a palanquin.

629
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,650
There it is.

630
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,389
Yes.

631
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:06,130
You should go home.

632
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:12,030
I would love to look around some more,
but I cannot.

633
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:16,769
My husband cannot eat without me present.

634
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:20,110
Goodbye.

635
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:27,719
Do me a favor.

636
00:47:36,989 --> 00:47:38,260
In the near future,

637
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:41,130
Ryang Eum will invite some friends...

638
00:47:41,699 --> 00:47:43,699
and entertain them with his songs.

639
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,440
Could I...

640
00:47:47,539 --> 00:47:48,869
see you then?

641
00:47:51,269 --> 00:47:52,340
Please come.

642
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:57,179
It is my last request.

643
00:48:03,489 --> 00:48:04,550
Let me out.

644
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,230
My lady.

645
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:16,800
What pretty clothes.

646
00:48:17,429 --> 00:48:19,300
Gil Chae can look pretty sometimes.

647
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,940
Watch it. You should not be so rude.

648
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:24,869
Is this it? Is this the house?

649
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:26,539
I think so.

650
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:28,940
Is it her or her? Which one is it?

651
00:48:31,179 --> 00:48:32,409
It is her.

652
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:39,889
What are you doing?

653
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:42,320
Do you care for nothing
because you slept around...

654
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:43,989
with foreign intruders?

655
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:47,630
How dare you seduce my husband?

656
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:49,530
All I did...

657
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:53,500
was give him directions when he asked.

658
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,440
How dare a wench
with foreign dirt talk back at me?

659
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,440
- Is that all you can say?
- I am not done yet!

660
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,280
- You are dirty rags!
- You witches!

661
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,139
- Get out!
- Know your place!

662
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:04,010
- Get out!
- Get off me.

663
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:18,530
We should get clean.

664
00:49:20,429 --> 00:49:21,500
You are so dirty.

665
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,300
Gosh. You are so muddy.

666
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:26,699
Blow your nose.

667
00:49:27,699 --> 00:49:29,139
Harder. One, two, three.

668
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,769
Again. One, two, three. Blow.

669
00:49:32,309 --> 00:49:33,539
That is so dirty.

670
00:49:33,909 --> 00:49:35,510
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

671
00:49:37,449 --> 00:49:38,449
Wait.

672
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:44,219
No! How could you?

673
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:45,820
Come here.

674
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:47,289
Here. There you go.

675
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:51,159
Come here. You too.

676
00:49:51,159 --> 00:49:52,489
Come back here.

677
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:55,599
There. What?

678
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,599
- You cannot catch me.
- Come here.

679
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:01,570
Get back here and wash up.

680
00:50:01,869 --> 00:50:02,969
No.

681
00:50:02,969 --> 00:50:04,510
She was forced to divorce?

682
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:07,179
Yes.

683
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:13,150
Do not go to her.

684
00:50:15,619 --> 00:50:18,489
Look. She is smiling.

685
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:21,019
Gil Chae!

686
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:23,789
Come here.

687
00:50:23,789 --> 00:50:25,260
If you show up now,

688
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:28,800
she will want to cry.

689
00:50:55,119 --> 00:51:00,559
<i>I am looking from afar</i>

690
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:09,639
<i>At your endearing face</i>

691
00:51:11,309 --> 00:51:15,280
<i>The face that I missed</i>

692
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,250
<i>Was carried</i>

693
00:51:19,849 --> 00:51:24,920
<i>By the distant wind</i>

694
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,219
I came because you said
it was your last request,

695
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:30,360
- but never again...
- Thank you.

696
00:51:31,059 --> 00:51:33,260
He has started. We should go inside.

697
00:51:36,699 --> 00:51:43,809
<i>Burying your face in your hands</i>

698
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:49,239
<i>The moment</i>

699
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:53,349
<i>I was waiting for</i>

700
00:51:53,550 --> 00:52:01,489
<i>Walk on that path</i>

701
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:10,469
<i>Even when you waver</i>

702
00:52:10,469 --> 00:52:18,440
<i>In the moonlight</i>

703
00:52:19,739 --> 00:52:23,139
<i>I keep</i>

704
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,980
<i>Thinking of you</i>

705
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:35,519
<i>But you turn away</i>

706
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:41,659
<i>My lingering feelings</i>

707
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,130
You used to love...

708
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,570
Ryang Eum's singing.

709
00:52:48,539 --> 00:52:50,239
- So...
- I must go.

710
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:53,139
<i>With the passing of time</i>

711
00:52:53,139 --> 00:52:57,050
<i>This heart that loves you</i>

712
00:52:58,409 --> 00:52:59,449
What happened?

713
00:52:59,449 --> 00:53:01,219
- What is wrong?
- How strange.

714
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:03,179
Why will he not sing?

715
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:05,849
Why did he suddenly stop?

716
00:53:06,889 --> 00:53:08,659
- How odd.
- What could it be?

717
00:53:10,659 --> 00:53:11,860
I apologize.

718
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:14,199
I am still plagued with nausea.

719
00:53:19,099 --> 00:53:21,000
Could such a world exist?

720
00:53:23,309 --> 00:53:24,539
Under the moonlight,

721
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:27,940
the air filled with Ryang Eum's singing,

722
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:31,650
and the sound of
the marvel of Peru blooming.

723
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:33,750
That kind of world.

724
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:37,849
Does the marvel of Peru make a sound?

725
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:40,820
You have not heard it?

726
00:53:41,789 --> 00:53:43,219
I have.

727
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:47,960
It is a very rare sound.

728
00:53:54,039 --> 00:53:55,099
I should...

729
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:57,510
get in my palanquin.

730
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:03,349
Do you remember...

731
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:06,619
what I said before?

732
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:14,320
I said I would no longer
be a burden to you.

733
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,929
I got to keep that promise.

734
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:24,929
I am so relieved.

735
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,300
So...

736
00:54:30,539 --> 00:54:31,809
You should also...

737
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,110
be at peace as much as you can.

738
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:47,519
How long do you plan to trick me?

739
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:53,699
How long...

740
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,530
do you think you can trick me?

741
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,639
This is how foolish I am.

742
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:11,610
To think that I could trick you.

743
00:55:12,849 --> 00:55:13,949
Lady Yoo.

744
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:17,449
I am living fine on my own.

745
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:20,260
So, do not feel sorry for me...

746
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,320
or pity me.

747
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:24,659
That is...

748
00:55:25,659 --> 00:55:27,230
what I want.

749
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,099
No.

750
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,630
I cannot do that.

751
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:33,940
Please do so.

752
00:55:36,039 --> 00:55:37,369
In Simyang,

753
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:43,780
I left as you wanted me to.

754
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:47,880
Now, it is your turn.

755
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:54,219
Please pretend like you did not see me.

756
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:47,710
Things did not go well.

757
00:56:48,579 --> 00:56:50,250
But do not worry about Lord Lee.

758
00:56:50,849 --> 00:56:52,550
I explained to him so he would understand.

759
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:53,780
"Understand?"

760
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,989
How...

761
00:56:59,019 --> 00:57:00,119
amazing.

762
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,519
I mean you.

763
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:06,190
- What?
- Why?

764
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:09,030
Will you clout me for talking down to you
when you are a noblewoman?

765
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:12,469
As usual,

766
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,639
your feelings...

767
00:57:15,239 --> 00:57:17,269
and your pride were
the most important today, were they not?

768
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,039
So you did not even care to see
Lee Jang Hyun's pain, did you?

769
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:24,750
I hate that Lee Jang Hyun is sad...

770
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,409
because of a woman like you.

771
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,219
It drives me mad with pain
that Lee Jang Hyun gets hurt...

772
00:57:28,219 --> 00:57:30,219
because of a woman like you.

773
00:57:31,889 --> 00:57:32,989
If I were you...

774
00:57:36,059 --> 00:57:39,130
If I had at least a corner of
Lee Jang Hyun's heart like you do...

775
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:43,300
If that were true...

776
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,670
Why on earth are you...

777
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,239
You have no right.

778
00:57:51,309 --> 00:57:53,139
No right to be loved by Lee Jang Hyun,

779
00:57:53,139 --> 00:57:55,010
and no right to be ignored by him.

780
00:57:57,409 --> 00:57:58,510
You...

781
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:04,090
have no right to have
anything of Lee Jang Hyun.

782
00:58:29,909 --> 00:58:31,309
What do you know?

783
00:58:56,269 --> 00:58:57,369
So,

784
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:00,739
did Lady Yoo say she would come running
to you now that she is divorced?

785
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,309
She said no, did she not?

786
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:08,949
I knew it.

787
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,119
To that woman,

788
00:59:11,619 --> 00:59:13,690
she is the most important person
in the world.

789
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,190
So, your heart can always be...

790
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:17,389
Watch your mouth.

791
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:28,639
I will be going to Uiju soon.

792
00:59:30,269 --> 00:59:31,369
I will go...

793
00:59:33,639 --> 00:59:35,239
and bring back Yang Chun.

794
00:59:37,179 --> 00:59:38,809
Then, will we go back to
how it was in Uiju...

795
00:59:38,809 --> 00:59:41,550
Then, I will head over to Qing...

796
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,250
and finish up my affairs
with the princess.

797
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:49,690
What promise did you make
with the princess?

798
00:59:50,489 --> 00:59:51,760
What on earth did you say...

799
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:54,929
that she took in the captives
in Simyang...

800
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,730
and let you go so easily?

801
00:59:59,769 --> 01:00:01,969
I said I would go to the princess' side.

802
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:03,340
However,

803
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:11,909
the situation has changed now.

804
01:00:12,949 --> 01:00:14,119
Back then,

805
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,849
I did not know
that Lady Yoo had gotten divorced.

806
01:00:22,489 --> 01:00:23,659
So?

807
01:00:36,139 --> 01:00:37,170
Can we not...

808
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:42,579
go back to before we met that woman?

809
01:00:45,179 --> 01:00:46,349
You, me,

810
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,519
Gu Jam, and Yang Chun.

811
01:00:51,789 --> 01:00:52,889
We were happy.

812
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,420
Do we...

813
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:00,530
not mean anything to you?

814
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,659
As if.

815
01:01:14,139 --> 01:01:15,280
Ryang Eum.

816
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:19,179
I could...

817
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:26,320
even die for you.

818
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:29,489
But now,

819
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,670
I want to live for that woman.

820
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:42,699
And...

821
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:47,780
anyone who gets in my way of doing so,

822
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:50,110
whoever they may be...

823
01:01:57,289 --> 01:01:58,789
I will never see them again.

824
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:07,800
Then I will come with you.

825
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:11,929
Fine.

826
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:15,170
You can live for that woman.

827
01:02:17,239 --> 01:02:18,340
Your little brother...

828
01:02:20,679 --> 01:02:22,239
will follow you...

829
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:26,849
wherever you go.

830
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:15,000
I have been waiting for you.

831
01:03:37,789 --> 01:03:39,389
Do you know
what I wanted to do the most...

832
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:43,519
if I were to meet you again?

833
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,960
Serving you a fresh hot meal...

834
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,329
I prepared.

835
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:50,289
Sitting together like this,

836
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:54,659
I feel as though
we are a husband and wife.

837
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:57,599
Now,

838
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,670
let us live like this
for a thousand years to come.

839
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:06,210
My lord.

840
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:10,750
Yoo Gil Chae.

841
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,889
Now, there are...

842
01:05:25,159 --> 01:05:27,090
no obstacles between us.

843
01:05:37,309 --> 01:05:39,469
So no one can stop me now.

844
01:06:04,369 --> 01:06:05,829
I truly enjoyed the meal.

845
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,639
It was such a hearty meal.

846
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:14,909
My wish has come true.

847
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:19,809
This is enough for me.

848
01:06:21,619 --> 01:06:23,650
I want nothing more from you.

849
01:06:25,219 --> 01:06:26,219
So please...

850
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:27,820
Why did you divorce him?

851
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:43,940
You never asked me about it,

852
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,679
and I never told you.

853
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:55,050
But in Simyang, I...

854
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:56,349
What happened in Simyang?

855
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,230
If you wish to tell me,
go ahead and say it.

856
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,199
I do not care.

857
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:24,980
Do you still not know how I am?

858
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:34,659
And how I feel?

859
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:39,530
Do you truly not know?

860
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,059
You are...

861
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:49,599
all I need.

862
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,280
Gil Chae, even if you are poor,

863
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:58,550
rich,

864
01:08:01,150 --> 01:08:02,820
insolent,

865
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:05,349
or obedient...

866
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:12,130
Even if you do not love me,

867
01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:18,069
and even if you say that you love me...

868
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:24,069
Whatever you are,

869
01:08:29,810 --> 01:08:31,279
you are all I need, Gil Chae.

870
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:42,220
Fine.

871
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:44,960
Then...

872
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:59,710
What if I say a foreign intruder
took advantage of me?

873
01:09:12,949 --> 01:09:15,890
Then I should give you a hug
for it must have been painful.

874
01:09:46,289 --> 01:09:47,659
It must have been truly painful.

875
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:56,430
You must have suffered a lot.

876
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:05,409
It is all over now.

877
01:10:07,979 --> 01:10:09,739
Do not worry about a thing from now on.

878
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:20,090
From now on,

879
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:23,090
I will stay by your side.

880
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:28,399
Even if you push me away,
I will stay right here.

881
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:32,199
Even if you get sick of me,

882
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:36,899
I will stay right by your side.

883
01:10:48,819 --> 01:10:49,850
The moment...

884
01:10:52,489 --> 01:10:54,720
I first saw you, I just knew...

885
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:01,600
that I had never once...

886
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,770
wanted someone else...

887
01:11:09,539 --> 01:11:11,569
other than you.

888
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:30,420
May I...

889
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,569
hold you?

890
01:12:23,909 --> 01:12:27,510
(My Dearest)

891
01:13:11,729 --> 01:13:15,500
I will make an embroidered pillowcase
for Lord Lee.

892
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:19,000
Guarantee me that the captives
will be able to cross the river safely.

893
01:13:19,229 --> 01:13:20,930
When Interpreter Lee returns,

894
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:22,739
we can all live happily together.

895
01:13:22,739 --> 01:13:23,739
Lee Jang Hyun.

896
01:13:23,739 --> 01:13:24,970
Only think about that and nothing else.

897
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:27,210
It is urgent. Hurry.

898
01:13:27,539 --> 01:13:28,579
Lee Jang Hyun.

899
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:29,880
Where is he?

900
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,350
If he were alive,
would he not be here by now?

901
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:34,180
It has gone.

902
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:35,750
Would we fear a woman...

903
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:37,149
who lost her chastity
to foreign intruders?

904
01:13:37,149 --> 01:13:38,850
Then you and Lee the interpreter...

905
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:41,560
You should have patched things up with him
long ago, then.

906
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:42,819
You know,

907
01:13:42,819 --> 01:13:44,159
he will stay with me now.

908
01:13:44,773 --> 01:13:48,533
