00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:08,109
(Episode 15)

4
00:00:39,409 --> 00:00:40,509
Lady Yoo.

5
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:53,259
My lord.

6
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,729
I have been released.

7
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,530
This is all...

8
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,140
thanks to you.

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,760
Are you awake?

10
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:39,000
My lord.

11
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,269
My lord.

12
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:45,980
My lord.

13
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,950
My lord.

14
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:51,180
My lord.

15
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,219
My lord...

16
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,719
My lord.

17
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:01,930
Pour me another drink.

18
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:06,829
Let us drink.

19
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:07,829
Yes, let us drink.

20
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,280
- Here.
- I am okay.

21
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,150
It is fine. You can have some.

22
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:49,710
You dirty thing.

23
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,680
How dare you smile at anyone?

24
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,280
Stop it!

25
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:10,360
Should I light the fire here?

26
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,199
Please spare me!

27
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:17,969
You are mine until the day you die.

28
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,789
He will be awake soon.

29
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,560
I will have to run away.

30
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,099
Will you come with me?

31
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,979
Where will you go?

32
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,150
Do not worry.

33
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,349
There is a strong man
named Yang Chun in Uiju.

34
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,689
If we run away and join him,

35
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:13,159
even the district magistrate
cannot touch us.

36
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,259
Let us go.

37
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:10,079
I cannot believe
I am meeting the person...

38
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,379
who saved
the Crown Prince's first son in Simyang.

39
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,620
You are my benefactor.

40
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:17,089
The benefactor who saved Joseon.

41
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:19,889
Tell me anything you want.

42
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,490
You must want to return to Joseon,
am I right?

43
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,000
Actually,

44
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:29,300
I would like to remain in Simyang for now.

45
00:05:56,029 --> 00:05:57,259
I dare you to touch that lass.

46
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,300
You are ridiculous.

47
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,569
Think I do not know you?

48
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,970
The other expensive slave you bought...

49
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,040
You made her pregnant, right?

50
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:07,509
And you killed her
while removing the baby.

51
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:08,670
Know how much we lost?

52
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,939
If it happens again,

53
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:12,579
I will throw your mother out!

54
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:13,949
What are they saying?

55
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,750
Why are they always fighting?

56
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:22,420
It is pretty, right?

57
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,060
My hands are more nimble than you think.

58
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:28,529
Whenever...

59
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:33,129
I did my madam's hair,
the men in Neunggun-ri would go crazy.

60
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,540
Ma'am, I will do your hair nicely
every day.

61
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,750
How adorable.

62
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:31,819
You lass.

63
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,129
Come here.

64
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,730
Do not move!

65
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,829
Go away!

66
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,639
Got a death wish? How dare you...

67
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,810
Let us go.

68
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,720
You fools.

69
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,959
Mother, let go!

70
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:13,870
How did you get here?

71
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:15,170
What do you think?

72
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:16,670
I flew here.

73
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,500
Seems like Ryang Eum is very upset
that you are injured.

74
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,840
I have never seen...

75
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:54,039
a man cry so sorrowfully.

76
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,740
How lucky you are.

77
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:01,179
You have a Qing royal pining for you,

78
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,879
and a friend who cries his heart out
when you are injured.

79
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,690
But do you know?

80
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,860
Now that you are injured,

81
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,769
I feel like you are finally mine.

82
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,409
I am so mean, right?

83
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,610
You are in pain, after all.

84
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,059
I have always...

85
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,139
wanted hold this hand.

86
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:58,120
Goodness. Why is it raining?

87
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,990
Gosh. We were almost at the inn.

88
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:11,700
Scoot closer, will you? It is cold.

89
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:14,539
Okay.

90
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:17,269
Oh, come on.

91
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,649
See?

92
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,720
It is less cold now.

93
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,389
Yes.

94
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,429
Right? You do not feel cold, right?

95
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,990
No.

96
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:40,929
Why didn't you...

97
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,269
come that day?

98
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,769
How could I leave my madam behind?

99
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,980
Besides...

100
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,190
I waited for a really long time.

101
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,629
You...

102
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:26,500
- Gu Jam is back!
- Gu Jam is back!

103
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,240
What?

104
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:42,690
Jong Jong!

105
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:46,019
Madam.

106
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:57,129
Are you all right?

107
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,399
- You okay?
- Yes.

108
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,480
I am sorry.

109
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:12,049
I promised to protect you
and keep you safe.

110
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:14,620
But I lost you.

111
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,090
I am really sorry, Jong Jong.

112
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:19,559
Do not be, Madam.

113
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:21,889
I knew...

114
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,629
I would meet you again.

115
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:42,379
Thank you so much.

116
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:45,019
I owe you my life.

117
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,690
No, I did not do much...

118
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,799
Wake up.

119
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:05,970
Get up already.

120
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,879
We received a letter from Joseon.

121
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,639
Soon, Lady Yoo's husband will...

122
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,710
What?

123
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,149
What?

124
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:18,279
Gosh.

125
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,149
Look at you.

126
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,019
You are even faking an illness now.

127
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,690
Do not say anything.

128
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,129
What is wrong with you?
This is so pathetic.

129
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:32,230
"Pathetic?"

130
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:33,659
How is this pathetic?

131
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:36,870
Gu Jam, use your brain.

132
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,070
If I completely heal,
Lady Yoo will return to Joseon.

133
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:41,539
Then will she leave alone?

134
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:43,840
Jong Jong will follow her.

135
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:46,809
No.

136
00:16:57,889 --> 00:16:59,759
His wound seems to be really deep.

137
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:02,159
At this rate, it will take six months...

138
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,389
No, not six months.

139
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,829
He might be bedridden for his entire life.

140
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,500
Stop the nonsense.

141
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:10,000
He will regain consciousness
no matter what.

142
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,670
Jong Jong probably wants
to go to Joseon this instant,

143
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:17,670
but until Lord Lee recovers,

144
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,509
I cannot go anywhere.

145
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,329
Do not slack off!

146
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,200
Hurry up!

147
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,440
Get moving!

148
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:53,539
Work faster!

149
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:54,750
Put everything here!

150
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:57,180
Come on.

151
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,450
Get moving!

152
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,279
Faster!

153
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,490
Hurry up!

154
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:07,859
- What are you waiting for?
- Hurry up.

155
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:09,559
- Hurry up.
- Hurry and follow us.

156
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:11,259
- What are you doing?
- Hurry.

157
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,059
- What are you doing?
- Yang Chun.

158
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,160
Come on.

159
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,799
You limp too?

160
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,700
It is the right leg for me.

161
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,970
Goodness.

162
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:46,160
Thank you.

163
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,430
Please relay our thanks
to Lord Lee Jang Hyun as well.

164
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,630
Do not get captured again.

165
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:53,599
Go.

166
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,500
When...

167
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,670
will we go to Joseon?

168
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:23,599
Why are you asking me that?

169
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,599
Then who do we ask?

170
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,079
The person
who Lord Lee Jang Hyun serves...

171
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,750
is you.

172
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,160
Goodness.

173
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:54,829
I have been aching all day.

174
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:14,119
Open your eyes.

175
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:22,160
Yang Chun.

176
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,230
Did you send Han Seok off...

177
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,769
safely?

178
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:30,769
I did.

179
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,569
How does it feel to make the crippled
do all the work while you lie in bed?

180
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:36,940
I mean...

181
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:39,880
The people...

182
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,950
like you way more than they like me.

183
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:46,519
They follow your orders just by hearing
that you are Gu Yang Chun from Uiju.

184
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:49,349
I thought you wanted to earn big money.

185
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:51,759
But you spent all your money
on sending captives back to Joseon.

186
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:52,890
Good going.

187
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,329
Yet you are just being bashed.

188
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,460
What?

189
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,759
"Bashed?"

190
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:05,470
They spoke ill of me? Why?

191
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,470
They all want to know
when they can go back to Joseon.

192
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,609
This is why...

193
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:13,609
I said you should not help the captives.

194
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:17,049
They spoke ill of me because of that?

195
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,279
Then tell them to find their own way back.

196
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,950
They do not even know
that we are escorting them...

197
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,589
because the way to Joseon is dangerous.

198
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,029
Well... Gosh.

199
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,559
Whatever.

200
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:33,559
Whatever! Who cares?

201
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,500
For those who have owners
who will release them,

202
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,269
we will use promissory notes.

203
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,369
And those who have no hope...

204
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,480
will be sent to Joseon secretly.

205
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,109
There is an order to everything,
and we must follow that order.

206
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,049
Anyway, the people
who will be going this time are...

207
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,059
Neop Seok, Sam Saeng,

208
00:21:59,589 --> 00:22:01,460
- Doo Nam,
- Doo Nam.

209
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,829
- Heo Chang...
- Heo Chang.

210
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:12,940
I thought I heard talking...

211
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:17,670
Lee Jang Hyun, you have to get up.

212
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,380
It breaks my heart
to see you sick, and I feel...

213
00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:25,450
He will...

214
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:27,319
regain consciousness no matter what.

215
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,390
Right?

216
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,759
He should. Yes.

217
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,559
All right, then.

218
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,829
Why are you covered in cold sweat?

219
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,269
He needs medicine.

220
00:24:04,349 --> 00:24:05,750
Lee Jang Hyun is gravely ill.

221
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,750
So, for the time being,
I will be in charge...

222
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,920
of sending you guys back.

223
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:12,720
Just as Lee Jang Hyun has been doing,

224
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,859
those of you
who can have your owners release you,

225
00:24:14,859 --> 00:24:17,190
we will lend you money,
so you should write a promissory note.

226
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,299
Then...

227
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,930
when do we have to pay back the money?

228
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:22,269
Can we repay the money once we return
to Joseon and earn money from farming?

229
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,799
- Yes.
- Then...

230
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,569
is it okay if it takes 3, no, 5 years?

231
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:29,869
Is ten years too long?

232
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:31,710
Of course it is too long. Come on.

233
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:32,809
It is okay.

234
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:34,279
As long as you promise to pay it back,

235
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,279
- we will lend you the money.
- Are you serious?

236
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:37,710
You cannot take your words back.

237
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,849
Come on. Yang Chun says we can.

238
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,720
What is wrong with you?

239
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,589
During the time
that Jang Hyun is in bed...

240
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,819
Listen carefully.

241
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,160
Even if you are to be released,

242
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,460
you all must know how dangerous
the road back to Joseon is, right?

243
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,660
- Yes.
- Yes.

244
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,259
Some die while crossing the river,

245
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:54,869
some get caught again
after losing their release forms,

246
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,069
and some die after running into bandits.

247
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,269
So it is best to work
under the Crown Prince...

248
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:01,839
as farmers and porters,

249
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:05,380
then wait for the right timing
to follow the envoys back to Joseon.

250
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:07,710
You should understand that...

251
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:10,650
and do as you are asked. Okay?

252
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,319
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

253
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,950
I can hear the money
draining out of our pockets.

254
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,720
Hurry up and get in line.

255
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,859
Thank you.

256
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,630
Yes.

257
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,759
Write down your name and where you live.

258
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:29,769
And when you will pay it back.

259
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:31,970
What is the use of getting
a promissory note?

260
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,940
We will not get any of this back. Gosh.

261
00:25:34,269 --> 00:25:35,569
My master...

262
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,740
will never release me.

263
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,309
If I go back,

264
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,950
I will lose Byung Hee.

265
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,250
I will...

266
00:25:50,619 --> 00:25:53,089
also be separated from my brother
and sold off.

267
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:56,759
I ran away several times before.
If I get caught,

268
00:25:57,859 --> 00:25:58,859
I will die.

269
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,799
I cannot find my master,

270
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,670
so I cannot get my release note.

271
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:06,940
If I just go back to Joseon,
I will be treated like a runaway captive.

272
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:09,069
I will be dragged back here.

273
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,480
Those of you
whose masters will not release you,

274
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,579
or those of you
who have lost your masters...

275
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:20,849
and cannot get your release notes,

276
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:26,259
will have to sneak into Joseon
when the time is right.

277
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,259
But that would be hard for women
and the elderly.

278
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,029
And if you even have a child with you...

279
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:37,369
I can go. Just let us go.

280
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:40,200
If you let us go,
I will even work around the house...

281
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,170
No one told you to do that.

282
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,140
Just take care of your child.

283
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,509
What was that?

284
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:58,150
What do you want to do
by helping Master Jang?

285
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,059
I want to eradicate
all the foreign intruders from Joseon.

286
00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:04,059
If only...

287
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,059
Joseon can return to before the intrusion,
when loyalty was still alive,

288
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:11,299
I would even risk my own life.

289
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:20,380
Following several years of poor harvest,

290
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,480
the recent drought
throughout the nation...

291
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:24,779
has left the wheat and barley crops
dried and dead,

292
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:26,650
staining the fields in red.

293
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,450
This is an unprecedented calamity.

294
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,319
Since the past,
when an unexpected change occurs,

295
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:34,890
a great decree of amnesty was issued.

296
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:37,690
May Your Majesty also show mercy...

297
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:40,859
and reduce the sentences of the guilty
to bring peace to the skies...

298
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,029
The foreign intruders are wielding weapons
to violate the land of Joseon...

299
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,269
and threaten His Majesty.

300
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:50,440
Do you think you can change the world
with such weak words?

301
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:01,349
Since the past,
when an unexpected change occurs,

302
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:04,049
a great decree of amnesty was issued.

303
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,859
This is not because one does not know
there are despicable criminals among them.

304
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,329
It is in case the sorrows of the people
might reach the skies.

305
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,460
But the lowest officials and soldiers
to the magistrates...

306
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:16,730
are using the execution grounds
as a place to vent their anger.

307
00:28:17,369 --> 00:28:19,670
How will the people rest peacefully?

308
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,769
My dear.

309
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,150
I am all right.

310
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:52,400
What is going on?

311
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,339
Today is the death anniversary of
Lord Yeongmu, Master Jang's late father.

312
00:28:56,339 --> 00:28:57,539
(Seonchin: A word to
respectfully address one's late father)

313
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,039
Every year on this day,
he refuses to eat or drink.

314
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:07,650
However,

315
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,150
the death anniversary of his father...

316
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,890
and the day that Master's only son died
are one and the same.

317
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:14,920
So,

318
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:19,829
he might be grieving the loss of his son.

319
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,670
He had a son?

320
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,309
So,

321
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,880
I am to send Garin Baksi
100 rolls of silk...

322
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,009
and 200 books of white paper
to Noshi Baksi?

323
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:35,579
Yes.

324
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:37,180
Speak well.

325
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:40,650
That way, it will be advantageous for us
when splitting the profits from ginseng.

326
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,890
How on earth would I speak well?

327
00:29:43,089 --> 00:29:44,190
Are you talking back to me?

328
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:47,359
Then you can take Ryang Eum with you.

329
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:54,599
Gosh.

330
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,269
What are you doing?

331
00:29:58,799 --> 00:29:59,869
What?

332
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,539
I had an itch on my back.

333
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,410
What is this terrible behavior
when Lord Lee is ill?

334
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,710
Go and wait outside.

335
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,210
Yes, Madam.

336
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:35,369
There is a cute little mole here.

337
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,559
I hear
they are farming the fields in Simyang.

338
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:59,660
I will try to find a way
to help with the farming too.

339
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,599
I must earn my keep.

340
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,680
Stoke the fire even more.

341
00:31:17,349 --> 00:31:19,049
We still have a long way to go
before we can melt metal.

342
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,319
Yes, Madam.

343
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,859
I said I would mend the farming tools,

344
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:31,430
and the Crown Princess had
a kiln made for us.

345
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,000
I even used to make knives
back in Hanyang.

346
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:38,099
Mending some farming tools
is a piece of cake.

347
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:26,880
Why is she not coming?

348
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,059
What happened?

349
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,890
I mean...

350
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,500
Gil Chae.

351
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,670
Where have you gone?

352
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,970
Have you...

353
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,769
Why is she not coming?

354
00:33:06,089 --> 00:33:09,359
That is why I told you to cool it down
after you heated it up enough.

355
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:12,500
You cannot rush when working with metal.

356
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,759
How many times did I tell you?

357
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,730
My goodness.

358
00:33:16,769 --> 00:33:17,970
That temper of hers.

359
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,509
You are the one who is the most rushed.

360
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:26,880
All right. Let us get to work.

361
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:35,589
Good.

362
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,460
Come this way, everyone.

363
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,130
- Come on.
- What are all these?

364
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,240
- Goodness.
- This looks brand new.

365
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,809
- Gosh.
- Thank you.

366
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:25,000
Leave it.

367
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:29,170
Why would you...

368
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,039
She really does not need to.
She might hurt her hand.

369
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,880
Goodness.

370
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:44,519
By the way,

371
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,059
what is your name?

372
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,489
Me? I am Ul Soo.

373
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:52,059
My name is Jul Soo.

374
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:53,900
Ul Soo and Jul Soo.

375
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:55,429
- Ul Soo.
- And Jul Soo.

376
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:01,070
- Ul Soo and Jul Soo.
- Ul Soo and Jul Soo.

377
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,539
Come and get your refreshments!

378
00:35:25,429 --> 00:35:26,699
Please enjoy.

379
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:29,670
- Please...
- Thank you.

380
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:31,429
- Jong Jong...
- Wait.

381
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,570
likes me.

382
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,369
- Please have another.
- She likes me not.

383
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,639
She likes me. She likes me not.

384
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:38,909
Go away!

385
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,980
She likes me.

386
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,079
- Thank you.
- She likes me not.

387
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:45,179
She likes me.

388
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,019
She...

389
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,760
She likes me not.

390
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,590
She likes me.

391
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:58,860
Oh, please.

392
00:36:01,929 --> 00:36:03,199
How ridiculous.

393
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,179
Hey.

394
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,619
Please remove the beans next time.

395
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:27,289
Why? Gu Jam likes beans.

396
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:28,789
Yes, I do.

397
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,389
Remove them.

398
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,730
- What?
- What is his problem?

399
00:36:55,849 --> 00:36:57,050
I have missed...

400
00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:02,989
your smiling face.

401
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,329
Your Highness.

402
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,110
Your Highness. The fields are...

403
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:23,880
<i>Let us be merry and pray for plenty</i>

404
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:28,619
<i>- Let us be merry and pray for plenty</i>
<i>- Let us be merry and pray for plenty</i>

405
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:33,690
<i>- Merry are we</i>
<i>- Merry are we</i>

406
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:38,530
<i>- As we pray for plenty</i>
<i>- As we pray for plenty</i>

407
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,099
How did...

408
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,130
this barren land...

409
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,329
Did you not know?

410
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:46,340
Joseon people...

411
00:37:46,769 --> 00:37:48,699
have always been the best at farming.

412
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,420
This reminds me of back in Joseon.

413
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:07,420
Whenever it was weeding season,
the local farmers...

414
00:38:07,989 --> 00:38:10,059
would sing like that.

415
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:13,159
I...

416
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,130
never knew what the people sang
as they worked.

417
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,170
All I did was stay indoors to read.

418
00:38:32,849 --> 00:38:33,949
Look.

419
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,619
Are they not gorgeous?

420
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:55,940
The grains are ready for harvest.

421
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:00,840
Why are you still so unconscious?

422
00:39:04,349 --> 00:39:05,650
I am afraid.

423
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,289
What if you never wake up?

424
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:21,900
I should have died instead.

425
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:25,940
If something happens to you,

426
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,909
I will not have the right to live.

427
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,550
I will die too.

428
00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:45,119
If only...

429
00:39:45,989 --> 00:39:48,789
I could die to save you.

430
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,590
I would kill myself right away...

431
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,369
My lord.

432
00:39:59,969 --> 00:40:01,099
My lord.

433
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:05,110
Please wait. I will call...

434
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,179
Let us stay together.

435
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:23,130
I know my health the best.

436
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,329
Although I can eat and talk,

437
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:28,059
and I look fine...

438
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,769
You see, my leg...

439
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:37,039
My leg hurts.

440
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,139
My leg...

441
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,949
hurts terribly so.

442
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,610
You know.

443
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,650
I know Jang Hyun well.

444
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:49,219
He must really be hurting right now.

445
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:51,989
Does it hurt?

446
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,519
Oh, dear.

447
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:55,960
This side aches...

448
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,090
But wait.

449
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,500
You were shot in the back.

450
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,760
Why does your leg...

451
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:09,809
There is something about the human body.

452
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:11,809
You see...

453
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:14,380
Everything is connected.

454
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:16,849
Am I right?

455
00:41:17,949 --> 00:41:19,110
Of course.

456
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,679
Our body parts are all connected.

457
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,349
Right?

458
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:26,360
That is right.

459
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,860
Even I...

460
00:41:32,429 --> 00:41:34,460
I was hit on the head, but I got a limp.

461
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,969
Look. I have to limp.

462
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:44,510
- Oh, no!
- Gosh!

463
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,340
You should hold onto him. He will die.

464
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,780
- Be careful.
- Please be careful.

465
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,019
It hurts so bad.

466
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:57,219
I think we should start practicing.

467
00:41:58,519 --> 00:41:59,989
One.

468
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,760
Two.

469
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,929
One.

470
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,530
Two.

471
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,730
- Are you all right?
- It hurts a lot.

472
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:09,329
One.

473
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,829
There you go. Good job.

474
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,469
Jang Hyun really threw everything for her.

475
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,340
I told you so.

476
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:35,159
What do you do for a living?

477
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,360
I thought you were serving the country.

478
00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:40,699
When did you seduce a princess?

479
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:43,829
When did I seduce her?

480
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:45,329
She was the one who liked...

481
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:49,309
Are you jealous?

482
00:42:51,409 --> 00:42:52,639
Why would I be jealous?

483
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:55,840
She is just...

484
00:42:56,579 --> 00:42:57,809
a pale...

485
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:01,420
and ugly woman. Why would I be jealous?

486
00:43:02,889 --> 00:43:04,190
Besides, Ryang Eum...

487
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:10,460
Anyway, I still do not know what is...

488
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,829
in that head of yours.

489
00:43:12,829 --> 00:43:14,360
Are you even a noble?

490
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:15,860
Rumors say...

491
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:23,369
Did you...

492
00:43:24,139 --> 00:43:27,010
really buy yourself a title
as the rumors say?

493
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:29,949
Were you a peasant originally?

494
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:38,349
A government slave.

495
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,590
I had to empty
the magistrate's chamber pot...

496
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,300
and keep the fire alight all night.

497
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,030
That kind of slave.

498
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:59,070
My mother passed on early,
while my father...

499
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:03,909
I do not even recall him.

500
00:44:06,619 --> 00:44:07,849
Nevertheless.

501
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,349
When I paid in rice,

502
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:12,989
His Majesty stamped his seal
to make me a nobleman,

503
00:44:12,989 --> 00:44:14,619
so I am a member of the nobility now.

504
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,130
Money is nice.

505
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,869
That is why...

506
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:26,570
I work hard to earn money.

507
00:44:29,909 --> 00:44:30,940
By the way,

508
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:35,139
were you put off by the fact...

509
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,610
that I was a commoner?

510
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,159
It would have been better...

511
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,659
if you never became an aristocrat.

512
00:44:56,869 --> 00:44:57,869
Why?

513
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,300
I would have made you my servant...

514
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,639
and brought you along with me
wherever I went...

515
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,309
and done whatever I wanted.

516
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,949
Then it would have been nice.

517
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:19,349
Then I will reject my appointment
and become a commoner.

518
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:21,760
Will you buy me?

519
00:45:24,329 --> 00:45:25,530
Sure.

520
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:39,480
Why did you not come that day?

521
00:45:45,949 --> 00:45:46,949
Why...

522
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:51,250
did you abandon me?

523
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:13,440
I did not abandon you.

524
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:18,010
I just...

525
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,420
could not dare have you.

526
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:29,460
You can live without me, but...

527
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:32,329
Why do you think that?

528
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,800
Why...

529
00:46:45,409 --> 00:46:47,909
did you think I could live...

530
00:46:51,449 --> 00:46:52,650
without you?

531
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,389
Who are you?
Why were you thinking of killing me?

532
00:48:09,889 --> 00:48:10,989
You...

533
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:13,099
I remember you.

534
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,400
You used to catch captives
with Lee Jang Hyun.

535
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:19,070
Am I right?

536
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:26,639
You must have wanted to kill me
because I hurt your owner.

537
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:34,250
Go and tell Lee Jang Hyun...

538
00:48:35,449 --> 00:48:36,519
that I am going to...

539
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:38,320
call him soon.

540
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:52,530
You are here.

541
00:49:00,909 --> 00:49:02,909
You do not have to act like
you are in pain in front of me too.

542
00:49:05,079 --> 00:49:06,150
Lady Yoo...

543
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:08,980
You should send her back to Joseon now.

544
00:49:10,019 --> 00:49:12,190
What are you going to do
if Her Highness tries to hurt you again?

545
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:15,690
That will not happen.

546
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,530
What are you saying?

547
00:49:18,329 --> 00:49:20,099
She tried to kill you.

548
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:26,369
I want to rest.

549
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:27,739
You can leave now.

550
00:49:36,309 --> 00:49:37,309
Are you actually...

551
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:40,420
in pain?

552
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:46,820
It is because everything
in the body is connected.

553
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:48,789
I am okay.

554
00:49:49,829 --> 00:49:52,760
One time, you almost died
trying to save her on Ganghwa Island.

555
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:56,059
This time, you hurt your leg
trying to release her.

556
00:49:57,570 --> 00:49:58,730
What is it going to be next time?

557
00:49:59,369 --> 00:50:01,070
What are you going to give up
for that woman next time?

558
00:50:02,139 --> 00:50:03,239
"That woman?"

559
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:08,210
Watch your mouth.

560
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:09,579
You should just die now.

561
00:50:11,449 --> 00:50:12,449
I do not think...

562
00:50:13,579 --> 00:50:16,449
I can watch you
be ruined little by little,

563
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:18,550
so you should just die right now.

564
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,099
You...

565
00:50:32,469 --> 00:50:33,800
are driving me crazy.

566
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:00,329
Did you really handle that matter?

567
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:03,369
Yes, I am telling you I did.

568
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,840
Now, Ningguchin will pay Yang Chun
without any complaints.

569
00:51:09,809 --> 00:51:11,070
Just you wait.

570
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,440
I will build a nice lodging facility...

571
00:51:13,809 --> 00:51:15,739
for you to sing all you want.

572
00:51:17,409 --> 00:51:19,550
You should just get married
with that money.

573
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,150
What is the point of getting married?

574
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:26,090
Just living the rest of my life...

575
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,190
listening to you sing is enough for me.

576
00:52:27,449 --> 00:52:28,920
How handsome.

577
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:15,860
- You are here.
- Yes.

578
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:19,869
Where is the list of goods
to send to the Japanese office?

579
00:53:20,199 --> 00:53:21,269
Oh, is this it?

580
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:30,710
I am no longer that jerk's servant.

581
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:33,349
What?

582
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:43,389
Now, I am...

583
00:53:51,769 --> 00:53:54,539
- Madam, you must keep it a secret.
- Well, I will think about it.

584
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:13,559
You have been released.

585
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,119
You should now return to Joseon.

586
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,360
Lord Lee's leg is still not well.

587
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:21,530
Once he is fully recovered...

588
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:22,630
I will...

589
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:25,199
tend to his recovery.

590
00:54:35,539 --> 00:54:36,679
That time before,

591
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,409
why did you say
that Interpreter Lee was dead?

592
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,449
I do not know why you lied,

593
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,489
but Interpreter Lee would want me...

594
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:51,929
to nurse him, not you.

595
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:06,170
This is...

596
00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:10,150
You saw the wound...

597
00:55:12,349 --> 00:55:13,480
on Lord Lee's back, right?

598
00:55:15,219 --> 00:55:17,590
Do you know how he got that wound?

599
00:55:22,989 --> 00:55:24,730
The harvest turned out really well.

600
00:55:25,929 --> 00:55:27,559
Instead of letting the leftover rice...

601
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:29,199
from the Crown Prince's quarters
rot in storage...

602
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,340
Do you want to sell it?

603
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:44,679
In Simyang, everyone from
Jung Myung Soo, Yong Gol Dae,

604
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:47,679
and the emperor's family members
require a bribe...

605
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:49,349
for every little thing one tries to do.

606
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:52,150
However,

607
00:55:52,889 --> 00:55:55,119
I cannot ask Joseon to pay
for those bribes as well.

608
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,929
So, I would like to invest
with the rice we have harvested here...

609
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:03,599
I will help you make a profit
from selling the rice.

610
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,670
Then,

611
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:09,500
would you be able to manage
the money from the profits?

612
00:56:11,739 --> 00:56:13,269
I cannot do that.

613
00:56:15,809 --> 00:56:17,949
Money that is not managed
by the one who earned it...

614
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,650
becomes poison.

615
00:56:21,019 --> 00:56:22,420
If there is a profit,

616
00:56:23,789 --> 00:56:25,989
who you spend it on,
what you trade it with,

617
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:29,159
and where to keep it
should all be your decision.

618
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:33,630
I will help you in every way I can.

619
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:36,460
But...

620
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,900
I have never managed money before.

621
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:40,570
You must do it.

622
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:45,869
You managed the farming well too.

623
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,380
Today,

624
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,320
I will have to write in my journal
for the first time in a while.

625
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:00,619
I should draw all the rice and food
you have bestowed upon me...

626
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:02,960
to be passed down...

627
00:57:03,289 --> 00:57:04,960
to the descendants.

628
00:57:07,059 --> 00:57:08,699
You will write and draw in your journal?

629
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,440
Then...

630
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:22,579
The person who saved me on that island...

631
00:57:23,949 --> 00:57:25,079
was really...

632
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,389
Yes.

633
00:57:33,389 --> 00:57:35,920
Lord Lee had to fight off the intruders
while suffering from smallpox...

634
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,590
and was on the brink of death.

635
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:38,960
And here, in Simyang,

636
00:57:40,829 --> 00:57:43,000
he has developed a limp from saving you.

637
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:47,699
So, things have become certain.

638
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,539
To Lee Jang Hyun,

639
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:00,780
you are...

640
00:58:05,789 --> 00:58:06,820
a curse.

641
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:44,989
I have nothing to give
to a rock on the run.

642
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,860
How did Young Master Yeon Jun
end up getting so severely hurt?

643
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:50,929
No.

644
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:52,929
What were you doing while Young Master...

645
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:54,599
was getting himself injured?

646
00:58:54,869 --> 00:58:55,940
Lady Gil Chae.

647
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:58,639
Is it my fault...

648
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:00,309
that Young Master Yeon Jun got hurt?

649
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,579
I am fine.

650
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:07,219
Where are you going?

651
00:59:09,019 --> 00:59:11,389
Why do you think
I carried all those women across?

652
00:59:31,139 --> 00:59:32,340
Are you okay?

653
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:55,360
My lady.

654
00:59:56,199 --> 00:59:58,199
Let me tell you the truth. That day...

655
01:00:00,469 --> 01:00:02,170
The person who saved you that day...

656
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:09,039
was I, not that man.

657
01:00:14,449 --> 01:00:17,050
I will return
with the prettiest floral shoes.

658
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:29,460
No!

659
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:31,170
No! Gil Chae!

660
01:01:54,019 --> 01:01:55,119
Wait, you mean...

661
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,989
you just ate the food
that the Crown Princess prepared for you?

662
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,590
What dishes did she serve? Do they not...

663
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:04,489
sprinkle gold powder on the food
and stuff like that...

664
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:33,690
You are not dead.

665
01:02:36,289 --> 01:02:38,090
You spared my life.

666
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:40,329
That is right.

667
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,929
It would be a waste to kill you.

668
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:44,099
If you were to die,

669
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,940
I would lose a source of entertainment.

670
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:53,070
Thank you for releasing Lady Yoo.

671
01:02:54,639 --> 01:02:57,039
I said I would let that woman live.

672
01:02:57,809 --> 01:03:00,110
I did not say I would allow you
to keep her by your side.

673
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,849
Now, that girl...

674
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:04,820
must return to Joseon.

675
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,929
I am someone who keeps her promises.

676
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:17,599
I would never hurt a woman
with my own hands.

677
01:03:19,369 --> 01:03:22,639
However, bad things will happen
to the Joseon captives...

678
01:03:22,969 --> 01:03:24,670
living in Simyang.

679
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:28,510
Even if they were released,

680
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:30,710
if someone else claims ownership of them,

681
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,710
they will become slaves again.

682
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:35,150
If they lose their release papers,

683
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:38,389
they will become escapees
and have their ankles slashed.

684
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:42,119
If they hold on to fake release papers,

685
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:43,460
their ears will be pierced.

686
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:45,760
Or worse, beheaded...

687
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,000
Back off. We are sparring.

688
01:03:56,369 --> 01:03:58,239
If you lay a finger on her,

689
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:03,510
I will kill you.

690
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:08,949
I understand...

691
01:04:11,719 --> 01:04:12,750
how you feel.

692
01:04:14,659 --> 01:04:17,590
You see, even the thought of you dying...

693
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:21,559
tortures me too.

694
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,500
You want to save her?

695
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:31,440
In that case,

696
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:34,239
send her to Joseon.

697
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:53,429
(My Dearest)

698
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:39,610
She wanted to go to Joseon with you.

699
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:42,179
Your husband abandoned you,

700
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:44,849
despite knowing you were in Simyang.

701
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:47,579
If you do not come to me,

702
01:05:47,579 --> 01:05:50,519
you and all the captives you have...

703
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:52,019
will be buried.

704
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,190
I will not leave.

705
01:05:54,989 --> 01:05:56,719
If I am a curse to Interpreter Lee,

706
01:05:57,329 --> 01:05:59,329
the only one who can undo the curse is me.

707
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:01,329
Can we stay together?

708
01:06:01,659 --> 01:06:03,260
If you do not like it here,

709
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:05,800
I will go wherever you want.

710
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:12,975
