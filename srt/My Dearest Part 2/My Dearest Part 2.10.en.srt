1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,209
(This drama is a work of fiction
created based on historical facts.)

2
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:04,080
(Most of the details and depictions
of the characters are fictional.)

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,650
(Episode 20)

4
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:12,209
Did you perhaps act
upon the Crown Prince's orders?

5
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:24,920
My lord.

6
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,329
I hope...

7
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:39,000
I did not do anything too silly.

8
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,849
My lord.

9
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,930
I am sorry.

10
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:10,840
It took too long, did it not?

11
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,000
I am so sorry.

12
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,050
My lord.

13
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,180
My lord.

14
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,919
Who...

15
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:05,460
are you?

16
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,189
Do not joke around like that.

17
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,099
Why?

18
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:15,500
Are you worried
I might lose my memory again?

19
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,569
Do not worry.

20
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,939
Something like that will not happen again.

21
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,509
The physician...

22
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,439
kept scaring me that you might...

23
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,810
lose your memory forever.

24
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,449
You seem to regain your memory...

25
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:36,960
whenever you look at my face.

26
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:41,189
I should stick right by your side
wherever you go.

27
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:52,439
By the way,
what happened to the Crown Prince?

28
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,750
I think there was someone...

29
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,789
who told His Majesty everything
about the Crown Prince.

30
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:20,500
Pyo Eon Kyum...

31
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,470
wants to meet with you.

32
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:30,540
I want to stop working as a eunuch now.

33
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:41,250
Do not think of quitting.

34
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,529
Just go and get some rest
before returning to work.

35
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:52,199
Why are you giving me this?

36
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,360
Why else?

37
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,000
You deserve it.

38
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,399
Thanks to you,

39
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,410
we were able to get rid of
our greatest enemies beforehand.

40
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,379
What do you mean?

41
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,160
Good work.

42
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,610
Mother, you sent me to the palace
when I was a young boy,

43
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,709
and you enjoyed a life of comfort.

44
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:44,779
I guess it was worth
making your son a eunuch.

45
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,569
Even in the future,

46
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,170
I will not make you worry about
being able to afford a living.

47
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,439
You are here.

48
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,149
What on earth is this?

49
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:58,060
I drank the same poison...

50
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,829
that was given to the Crown Princess.

51
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,759
As this poison is mild,

52
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,600
I heard even Her Highness...

53
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:12,839
suffered for two whole days.

54
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,980
Do you think
this will wash your sins away?

55
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:33,660
I will call for a physician.

56
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:34,889
It is too late.

57
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:38,829
There is no use now.

58
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,310
Do you...

59
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,449
Do you remember the day we first met?

60
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,379
Look.

61
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,389
You should think of winning a victory.

62
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:04,660
Why is everyone so determined
to die while fighting?

63
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,430
Since we are already risking our lives,

64
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:10,759
should we not risk them for a fight
that will end up in a victory?

65
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:16,930
- What are you doing?
- I protect His Highness,

66
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,800
so protecting me is like
protecting His Highness.

67
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,410
I noticed you from the start.

68
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:31,449
If it was you,

69
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,120
I knew you would protect me.

70
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,159
Both me...

71
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,629
and His Highness.

72
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,600
If it was you...

73
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,279
So how can you betray His Highness?

74
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:00,980
I thought it was
the only way to save His Highness.

75
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,620
His Highness...

76
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:12,090
did such a great job
entertaining the Qing emperor.

77
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:18,429
He was always worried for the captives.

78
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:23,399
And I wanted to let everyone know.

79
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:30,980
But I was fooled.

80
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,110
They had fooled me.

81
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,289
They fooled me.

82
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,950
His Highness' body...

83
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,320
Every orifice of His body...

84
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,659
oozed with black liquid.

85
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,960
Please ease his grievances.

86
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:31,799
His Highness...

87
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:36,409
left a letter for you.

88
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:19,480
Your Majesty.

89
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:22,190
How is your illness these days?

90
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,620
I have recovered from the symptoms.

91
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,129
Because you lot did not believe
how wicked Thief Kang was,

92
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,700
His Majesty suffered a bout of fury.

93
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:35,129
Luckily, Jin Saeng's report...

94
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,570
exposed her atrocities to the world.

95
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,000
That was how His Majesty could recover!

96
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,549
How did the court ladies react?

97
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,149
Please do not bother about them.

98
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:57,149
They must be gossiping
about silly rumors again.

99
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,559
Like how Thief Kang stowed away a lady,

100
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,259
how she had a will,

101
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:05,259
or that His Highness left behind
a letter before he passed...

102
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,529
What letter?

103
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,139
Rumors say
that His Highness wrote a letter...

104
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:12,700
before he died.

105
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,309
But no one saw it, so it was merely...

106
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:16,409
Find the letter.

107
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:21,580
Go and find the letter right now!

108
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,149
He must have...

109
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,090
written the letter
to get the Qing involved.

110
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:35,559
What...

111
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,700
What do we do about this?

112
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:46,169
- Search the place.
- Yes, sir.

113
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,409
Do a thorough search.

114
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,799
Are you the interpreters...

115
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,340
who served the late Crown Prince closely
back in Simyang?

116
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:21,769
All right.

117
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,440
Did any of you send His Highness' letter
to the Qing?

118
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,149
I have never seen or heard of a letter.

119
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,379
Did...

120
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,690
the letter end up in Gu Yang Chun's hands?

121
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,230
He is the leader of the traitors,
Gu Yang Chun.

122
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,230
Do not say that you do not know him.

123
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,870
If you do not tell the truth,
all of you will...

124
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,899
This person...

125
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,769
is not Gu Yang Chun.

126
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,080
He is...

127
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:20,929
Be sure...

128
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,600
to keep them forever.

129
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,960
Jang Hyun, read this.

130
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:16,250
You live here?

131
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,820
You...

132
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,690
Why I am here?

133
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:25,860
I am here to take Lee Jang Hyun.

134
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:34,240
How is the gentry acting?

135
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,470
Please do not worry.

136
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:39,779
After Jin Saeng's report,
everyone has been silent.

137
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,919
Have you taken care of the traitors...

138
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,850
that were kept in the prison?

139
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

140
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:54,990
We smashed all their heads in, but...

141
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,639
Please sentence me to death!

142
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:07,840
We smashed all their heads in,

143
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:09,539
but one of the bodies disappeared.

144
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,870
What?

145
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,509
Whose body disappeared?

146
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,379
It was...

147
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,509
Gu Yang Chun's body...

148
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,649
Was he not the leader of the traitors?

149
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:24,289
No, that is not true.

150
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,289
That guy was not Gu Yang Chun.

151
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,559
The leader of the traitors
that was imprisoned...

152
00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:33,029
turned out
to be Interpreter Lee Jang Hyun.

153
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:36,299
An interpreter?

154
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,740
Why, look at that.

155
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:40,799
I told you that...

156
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,970
the interpreters would be close
to Thief Kang.

157
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,950
So? What happened to him?

158
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,350
Is he dead or alive?

159
00:16:58,659 --> 00:17:01,059
I am aware that all of the Crown Prince's
followers are being purged.

160
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,289
No matter what I tried,

161
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:07,160
I could not find
any traces of Lee Jang Hyun.

162
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,400
Please tell me...

163
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:14,369
if he is okay or not.

164
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,240
Is he alive?

165
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,049
Yes, he is.

166
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,230
I will take Lee Jang Hyun with me.

167
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:40,759
Where is he?

168
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,869
Where is he?

169
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,849
Then...

170
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:05,690
can you help him?

171
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:12,160
Please help him.

172
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:30,349
Let the King of Joseon know...

173
00:18:31,349 --> 00:18:32,650
that soon,

174
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:35,220
a royal messenger
from the Qing will be arriving.

175
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,119
Also...

176
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,529
I was told that the letter
was left with the woman...

177
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,670
who saved the life
of the Crown Prince's son.

178
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:07,680
Gu Yang Chun.

179
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,019
No.

180
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,160
Interpreter Lee Jang Hyun.

181
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,839
Let His Majesty know I am here.
It is urgent.

182
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,599
He is already hearing some urgent news.

183
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,339
But do not worry, Your Majesty.

184
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,740
The slaves of the Palace Supply Bureau
have caught Lee Jang Hyun.

185
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:37,049
I ordered them to kill him immediately
to get rid of any future problems...

186
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,079
Your Majesty!

187
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:42,549
Your Majesty,

188
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:44,690
you must not kill Lee Jang Hyun.

189
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,259
Did you kill him?

190
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:50,829
Did you kill him?

191
00:19:58,799 --> 00:19:59,839
Attack!

192
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:02,539
Stop!

193
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,210
Stop!

194
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:05,609
Stop.

195
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:10,180
Stop.

196
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,819
A royal messenger is coming from the Qing.

197
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,160
But...

198
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,859
they asked for Lee Jang Hyun
to be their interpreter.

199
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:32,940
Interpreter Lee Jang Hyun...

200
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:35,140
got the Qing involved?

201
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,680
I heard a royal messenger was coming
suddenly, so I thought it was strange.

202
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,549
But it turns out Interpreter Lee
was behind it.

203
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:46,279
Jung Myung Soo has gone back and forth...

204
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,750
between the two countries
to derive benefits,

205
00:20:47,849 --> 00:20:49,950
but he has never called in
a royal messenger.

206
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,359
Are you certain this is true?

207
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,859
Is it not just a rumor?

208
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:57,559
The royal messenger from the Qing...

209
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:00,359
insisted on having Lee Jang Hyun
as the interpreter.

210
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:03,369
Interpreter Lee
served the Crown Prince in Simyang...

211
00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:05,000
and maintained close relationships
with the foreigners.

212
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:09,039
And now he is using that power
to suck the blood of Joseon.

213
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,980
Interpreter Lee must have his reasons.

214
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,910
Reasons? What reasons?

215
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:21,650
Now I see that Lee Jang Hyun
is worse than women.

216
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,859
Even women with no power were honorable
enough to take their own lives...

217
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:27,559
after just brushing past the foreigners.

218
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:33,500
My lord,

219
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,930
do you think
women should take their own lives...

220
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,799
if the foreigners grab their wrists?

221
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,240
I am not saying that is what they must do.

222
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,940
I am saying that is how Joseon
has been protected.

223
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,549
A single drop of ink...

224
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:51,349
is enough to make clean water dirty.

225
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:00,990
But...

226
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:03,890
only their wrists would have been grabbed.

227
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,730
Nothing else could have happened.

228
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:09,970
That is not what is important.

229
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,900
Whether it was just their wrists...

230
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:16,369
or something even worse,

231
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:19,140
they have lost their chastity.

232
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,319
Then...

233
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:29,690
do you think Gil Chae's return...

234
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,690
caused the water...

235
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,289
to become dirty?

236
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,059
No, I do not.

237
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,299
I am also happy...

238
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,630
that Lady Yoo is alive and well.

239
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:48,440
I am thankful for how brave she is.

240
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,640
However,

241
00:22:51,509 --> 00:22:52,910
I also understand...

242
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,349
Officer Gu's choice.

243
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:04,019
But you always felt for the people...

244
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,819
for all the hardships
they went through, did you not?

245
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:08,960
Just because I feel pity for the people...

246
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:11,599
does not mean
that women can neglect their chastity.

247
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,430
No, especially at a time like this,

248
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,329
subjects should be loyal...

249
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,539
and women should keep their chastity.

250
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:22,670
That is the only way for there to be
discipline in this troubled country...

251
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:25,339
and for the people to live in comfort.

252
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,849
Officer Gu works for the country.

253
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,180
If he wants to govern the country,

254
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:35,950
he must first maintain discipline
in his own household.

255
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:38,460
I know that very well.

256
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:43,559
That is why I am saying that Joseon women
who are truly honorable, must...

257
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:47,430
My lady.

258
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,539
Have Interpreter Lee Jang Hyun enter.

259
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,119
Your Majesty.

260
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:14,619
Who are you?

261
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,200
Answer me.

262
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,930
Reveal your identity.

263
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:23,769
I am an interpreter.

264
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,440
You are just an interpreter,

265
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,410
but the Qing is earnestly asking for you?

266
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,880
I am not just any interpreter.

267
00:24:40,349 --> 00:24:42,890
I was the late Crown Prince's...

268
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:47,089
favorite interpreter.

269
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,569
Your Majesty, the royal messenger is here.

270
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,039
His Majesty the Emperor...

271
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:06,480
wants to know what happened
to Crown Prince So Hyun's...

272
00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:07,710
three children.

273
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:10,579
He is curious about
Crown Prince So Hyun's three children.

274
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:15,549
I wonder how the Great Qing
knew the children of traitors.

275
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:20,259
But I do not think it is a matter in which
the Great Qing should get involved.

276
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,099
The children of a traitor?

277
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,569
Did the Crown Princess...

278
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:39,539
really plot treason?

279
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,410
Do you have evidence
of the Crown Princess' plot of treason?

280
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,019
He is asking...

281
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:54,089
about the evidence...

282
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,029
that proved...

283
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,430
the Crown Princess' guilt.

284
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,549
I ran into a foreign intruder
as I was running away.

285
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:26,089
But before I was
about to be abused by him,

286
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,359
Gil Chae helped me...

287
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,299
You met...

288
00:26:36,069 --> 00:26:37,230
a foreign intruder?

289
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:51,049
Jung Myung Soo has left,
but now Lee Jang Hyun is here.

290
00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:54,519
Do you plan to sit back and watch?

291
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:58,589
We cannot do that.

292
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:03,529
We cannot let a single drop of ink
dirty the entire pool of clear water.

293
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:08,430
(Hanyang Brazier)

294
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,670
I will show you
the best-tasting meat in Hanyang.

295
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,710
Does it not gleam...

296
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,210
and look tasty?

297
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,519
Meat is...

298
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,019
the best when grilled
on a brazier, indeed.

299
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,450
It is not bad.

300
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,960
How dare you bring in a foreign intruder?

301
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,349
Do you figure you will change your fortune
like Jung Myung Soo?

302
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:06,220
Do you want to have...

303
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,450
the authority of a king
with the Qing Empire backing you?

304
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,819
If I can.

305
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,329
I have known...

306
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:23,470
that you have been looking down on me
for a long time now.

307
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:26,740
But I still did not hate you.

308
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,410
We may be on separate paths,
but I believed...

309
00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:34,210
that both of us were concerned
about the people.

310
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,710
And yet, you bring in a foreign intruder?

311
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,890
Do you know?

312
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:46,519
Some people do not live on food
but on a sense of accomplishment.

313
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:48,630
Thanks to them,

314
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,460
this world does not become
overrun with wild beasts.

315
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,599
Thanks to those who die while
maintaining their loyalty and integrity,

316
00:29:56,329 --> 00:29:57,700
it is proven...

317
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,940
that even the most powerful
cannot rule this world however they want.

318
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,180
I will dedicate my soul
to clear up this land...

319
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,539
that has been tainted
by foreign intruders.

320
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:09,579
So,

321
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:12,920
if you become like Jung Myung Soo
and oppress Joseon,

322
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:16,549
I will bury...

323
00:30:18,289 --> 00:30:19,319
the long relationship between us,

324
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:21,059
and I will...

325
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,960
rid this land of you, no matter what.

326
00:30:35,609 --> 00:30:38,470
Seriously, your love of Joseon...

327
00:30:41,309 --> 00:30:43,579
is so sincere that it is even pitiful.

328
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,259
Do you perhaps have...

329
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,890
the Crown Prince's letter?

330
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:40,539
I want to keep my promise to those
who trusted me before it is too late.

331
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,240
Bring...

332
00:31:47,309 --> 00:31:48,710
the captives back to Joseon.

333
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,049
If I am unable to keep this promise,

334
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:56,150
I cannot call myself
the Crown Prince, a man,

335
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:58,960
or a human being.

336
00:32:01,059 --> 00:32:02,059
If...

337
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,059
something happens to me...

338
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:06,500
and I cannot be the Crown Prince
or the King,

339
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,829
please help me stay a human being,

340
00:32:11,069 --> 00:32:12,069
at least.

341
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:16,140
You are the only person...

342
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,269
I can ask to do this.

343
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,829
I give you all of my wealth...

344
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:47,700
and the wealth
that the Crown Princess saved up.

345
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,380
However,

346
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,680
as promised before,

347
00:32:57,779 --> 00:32:59,150
all of the captives...

348
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,549
must be in possession...

349
00:33:03,289 --> 00:33:05,890
of release papers recognized by
the financial office of Qing.

350
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,960
Also,

351
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,599
the captives will not cross the river.

352
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,630
They will confidently...

353
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,230
enter Joseon...

354
00:33:19,069 --> 00:33:20,799
via a land route.

355
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,039
If...

356
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,539
you guarantee this,

357
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:29,309
I will hand over this silver.

358
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,730
No one in Qing can pose questions...

359
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,500
regarding the Joseon captives
being released today.

360
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:51,869
I guarantee it.

361
00:33:56,539 --> 00:33:58,210
I guarantee it.

362
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,740
Yes, Your Highness.

363
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,579
- What are they doing?
- Those intruders.

364
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,139
What are they doing over there?

365
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,469
Those darn intruders.

366
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,420
We are going to Joseon now!

367
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,659
We are free now!

368
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,460
Yes!

369
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,800
My goodness!

370
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:28,800
We are free!

371
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:30,869
We are going home!

372
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,869
Hurrah!

373
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,170
Hurrah!

374
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,280
My gosh!

375
00:35:44,949 --> 00:35:46,320
We are free!

376
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:47,679
Yes!

377
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:49,690
We can go home now!

378
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:47,710
Your Highness.

379
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,750
Come with me, Jang Hyun.

380
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:56,590
I will take you from Joseon...

381
00:36:56,619 --> 00:36:58,489
while I still have power.

382
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,869
I have to return to my hometown.

383
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,239
Are you a fickle fool...

384
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,269
who cannot keep his promises?

385
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:20,780
Yes.

386
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,849
That is just the kind of fool I am.

387
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,619
This fickle fool...

388
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,329
would like to return
to his hometown alive.

389
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,139
If you return to Joseon,

390
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,380
you will die.

391
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,219
You will face death.

392
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:07,920
Is it because of her?

393
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,510
She...

394
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,010
is my hometown.

395
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:37,820
Now...

396
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,730
I want to return home and take a rest.

397
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,199
Either you leave with me...

398
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,940
or you die here.

399
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,010
Those are your only options.

400
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,309
Either way,

401
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,079
you will die if you go to Joseon.

402
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:11,019
My lord.

403
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:13,820
I know now.

404
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:18,829
I know how you feel about me.

405
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:22,400
I also know exactly how I feel...

406
00:39:23,469 --> 00:39:25,429
about you.

407
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,769
My lord.

408
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,809
I am happy
with these earnest feelings of love...

409
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:34,380
even if we are apart.

410
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:38,949
As long as you can be safe,

411
00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:41,480
even if you are far away,

412
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,590
my heart will be filled with joy.

413
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,590
Two Joseon interpreters
have already been flogged to death.

414
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,199
So please,

415
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,230
stay in the Qing...

416
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,250
No.

417
00:40:13,949 --> 00:40:15,179
I miss you.

418
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:19,760
I miss you.

419
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,980
In that case, I shall die on the way back.

420
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,320
Please forgive me.

421
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:46,110
Go.

422
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,179
Leave before I change my mind.

423
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,969
Your Highness.

424
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:18,110
Please be safe and healthy.

425
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:45,429
Farewell.

426
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:47,940
You worthy fool.

427
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,329
Gil Chae.

428
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:14,929
Your husband is coming.

429
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,230
- At Usimjeong in Uiju?
- That is what I said.

430
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:21,000
The captives are all gathered there,
covered in dirt.

431
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,940
There are always guards
patrolling around that area.

432
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:27,510
Some of the captives vowed
to take revenge for His Highness.

433
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:31,309
Is it really true that
the Crown Prince was poisoned to death?

434
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:33,619
- Watch your mouth!
- What if...

435
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:36,190
it causes an uproar in our village?

436
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:37,920
We should hurry.

437
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:56,369
(Uiju)

438
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,949
How did you...

439
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:06,920
I thought you could not come.

440
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:10,449
I told you I would be back.

441
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,360
Yang Chun.

442
00:44:16,889 --> 00:44:18,030
Jang Hyun.

443
00:44:25,269 --> 00:44:26,340
Jang Hyun, you...

444
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:35,380
Now that he is back, all is good.

445
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,650
It is good.

446
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:39,849
Have you been well?

447
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,550
By the way,

448
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:47,219
I heard His Highness
was poisoned to death.

449
00:44:47,219 --> 00:44:48,590
Is that true?

450
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,929
Did Lady Cho give him a poisoned needle...

451
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:55,030
That was not the rumor I heard.
It was His Majesty...

452
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:56,530
Oh, please. Stop it.

453
00:44:57,099 --> 00:45:00,099
Since we owe our lives to His Highness,

454
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,909
should we not avenge him?

455
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:06,710
Now that I am old,
I have no regrets even if I die.

456
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:08,480
I will do anything you say.

457
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:11,409
Please forget about His Highness.

458
00:45:12,349 --> 00:45:13,550
But...

459
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,250
he is our savior.

460
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:17,449
No matter if His Highness
was poisoned or not,

461
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,619
please...

462
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:23,630
stop trying to find out, or avenge him.

463
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:29,869
I am asking of you.

464
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:31,900
That is...

465
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:35,639
what His Highness would have wanted.

466
00:45:40,809 --> 00:45:42,110
After word got out,

467
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:45,179
more captives were making their way here.

468
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:48,980
Thousands of them were brought
to the Qing, after all.

469
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,519
Since people are gathering here,

470
00:45:52,789 --> 00:45:54,489
the Uiju government office
keeps sending people...

471
00:45:54,489 --> 00:45:55,719
to inspect the place.

472
00:45:57,389 --> 00:45:59,289
I am worried we will run into problems...

473
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:01,199
like last time.

474
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:02,230
Problems?

475
00:46:02,929 --> 00:46:04,000
What problems?

476
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,039
We are in Uiju,
and I am Gu Yang Chun of Uiju.

477
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,440
Yang Chun.

478
00:46:10,539 --> 00:46:12,340
We must not cause any trouble.

479
00:46:14,909 --> 00:46:15,980
I will handle...

480
00:46:17,179 --> 00:46:18,809
this matter.

481
00:46:34,829 --> 00:46:36,730
- Is it good?
- Yes.

482
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,429
It tastes good.

483
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,039
Here.

484
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:52,750
Eat up.

485
00:46:58,019 --> 00:46:59,019
Jong Jong.

486
00:47:00,889 --> 00:47:01,920
Gu Jam...

487
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:05,630
Gu Jam.

488
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:23,050
Madam.

489
00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:25,409
I presume...

490
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:29,420
Lord Lee went to the Qing.

491
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:33,219
That must be why you are here alone.

492
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,590
No, he will be here soon.

493
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:38,329
He told me to come here first.

494
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,730
I brought his letter.

495
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,340
Also...

496
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,869
Come in.

497
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:30,179
I am writing this letter
because I cannot return right away.

498
00:48:32,679 --> 00:48:35,579
The captives who are staying
at Usimjeong right now...

499
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:38,849
do not have anywhere to go...

500
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:40,960
or any family members to take them in.

501
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:44,260
If I neglect them as well,

502
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:46,130
they will not have much of a future,

503
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,860
so I am trying to help them.

504
00:48:49,429 --> 00:48:50,900
Please understand.

505
00:48:54,099 --> 00:48:55,969
Whenever I managed to fall asleep
after tossing and turning,

506
00:48:57,869 --> 00:48:59,909
I think I dreamt of you.

507
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:04,980
It would be nice
if I could remember my dreams,

508
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,119
but whenever I wake up from a light sleep,

509
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,690
all I remember is...

510
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:14,260
your name, Yoo Gil Chae.

511
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:17,789
I am always lost in thought over you,

512
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:21,429
so it feels like...

513
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,630
I have never fallen asleep or woken up.
Do you know that feeling?

514
00:49:57,929 --> 00:49:59,969
Madam, more people are here!

515
00:50:06,309 --> 00:50:07,309
Come on in.

516
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,139
You can go inside.

517
00:50:09,409 --> 00:50:10,679
I cleaned everything.

518
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:16,949
You must be excited.

519
00:50:18,219 --> 00:50:20,219
I have to take good care of them...

520
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:22,519
for Lord Lee to come back quickly.

521
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:25,030
So you better be good as well.

522
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:28,230
Now, Lee Jang Hyun...

523
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,269
is completely mine.

524
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,639
Hurry inside.

525
00:50:41,809 --> 00:50:42,809
You...

526
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:48,579
Oh, my.

527
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:05,769
Just as you said,
I sought Interpreter Lee's help,

528
00:51:06,739 --> 00:51:08,369
and he helped me.

529
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:11,739
Good job.

530
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:13,909
You did a wonderful job.

531
00:51:14,909 --> 00:51:15,909
By the way,

532
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,349
do you know if Da Jim...

533
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,320
is...

534
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:23,889
A square,

535
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,690
then a crooked triangle.

536
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:33,400
Then this is a long rectangle.

537
00:51:34,059 --> 00:51:35,130
Look.

538
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:39,230
Da Jim.

539
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:43,239
My son.

540
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:46,510
You have grown so much.

541
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,380
Da Jim.

542
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:57,420
Da Jim.

543
00:51:58,090 --> 00:51:59,150
She is your mom.

544
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:00,920
I told you, did I not?

545
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:03,429
Your mom...

546
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:06,699
has not once forgotten about you.

547
00:52:08,059 --> 00:52:11,369
Mom?

548
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,539
Yes, Mom.

549
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:15,969
Mom.

550
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:18,769
- It is me.
- Mom.

551
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:22,679
- My son.
- Mom.

552
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,349
Mom.

553
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:34,219
This will not be easy.

554
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,360
Baedan-ri is probably full by now.

555
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:40,559
We can make it work.

556
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:41,829
We will find a way.

557
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,730
How long has it been?

558
00:52:46,369 --> 00:52:48,039
You, me, and Gu Jam...

559
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,469
We traveled around the whole country
and observed various people.

560
00:52:53,809 --> 00:52:56,039
We did. It has been a while.

561
00:52:57,579 --> 00:52:58,780
It has been a while,

562
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,179
and it will probably be our last.

563
00:53:03,019 --> 00:53:04,150
What do you mean?

564
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:05,849
I am sick of this now.

565
00:53:06,619 --> 00:53:08,360
How long do I have to be
attached to you at the hip?

566
00:53:10,889 --> 00:53:13,190
Anyway, the people here
are so cold-hearted.

567
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:15,530
In Neunggun-ri,

568
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:17,500
the people even celebrated...

569
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,829
Grandpa Song Chu's
60th wedding anniversary together.

570
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:22,570
Come to think of it,
the elders of Neunggun-ri...

571
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:28,909
Courtesy comes from affection.

572
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,619
You must be tired.

573
00:53:43,789 --> 00:53:44,829
Yes.

574
00:53:56,739 --> 00:53:57,809
My lord.

575
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:03,280
I ran into a foreign intruder...

576
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:06,409
and I was almost raped...

577
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:14,619
But Gil Chae stabbed him to death...

578
00:54:15,019 --> 00:54:16,489
and rescued me from disaster.

579
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:19,829
Do you still think...

580
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:24,329
I have lost my chastity...

581
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,769
since my shoulder was grabbed
by a foreign intruder?

582
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:12,949
You have never once tricked me.

583
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:17,420
But you have kept it a secret...

584
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:20,860
that you were captured by
a foreign intruder for so long.

585
00:55:23,289 --> 00:55:24,429
This is...

586
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,960
the gruesome stain that the intruders
have left on Joseon.

587
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,739
Will you deny it?

588
00:55:57,989 --> 00:55:59,789
Will he not come today either?

589
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:29,360
My dear.

590
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:41,340
Did you just call me "My dear?"

591
00:56:42,739 --> 00:56:43,809
Yes.

592
00:56:44,139 --> 00:56:45,210
My dear.

593
00:56:51,179 --> 00:56:52,280
Yes.

594
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:54,780
Let us call each other
husband and wife from now on.

595
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:07,829
- You look beautiful!
- Be happy!

596
00:57:07,829 --> 00:57:09,130
- You look great!
- You are a lucky girl!

597
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:11,630
Goodness, you look pretty!

598
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:13,940
You look beautiful!

599
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,099
- She sure is beautiful.
- Goodness.

600
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:17,469
I am sure you will have sons.

601
00:57:17,469 --> 00:57:19,969
- What a great occasion.
- My goodness.

602
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:23,550
Gu Jam, you are a lucky man!

603
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:26,110
- My gosh.
- Treat her well, Gu Jam.

604
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,420
She looks so pretty.

605
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:37,730
How nice is this?

606
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,619
They look so great together.

607
00:58:04,289 --> 00:58:05,619
They sure do.

608
00:58:07,389 --> 00:58:08,559
- Goodness.
- They will live well together.

609
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:15,159
They look so happy, do they not?

610
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,280
We should drink up on a day like this.

611
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:35,519
My gosh.

612
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,789
- Have another drink.
- All right.

613
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,730
Let us drink up on a nice day like this.

614
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:48,860
Slow down, man.

615
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:53,030
This is a great feast.

616
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:55,800
Jong Jong and Gu Jam look great together.

617
00:59:00,539 --> 00:59:02,340
They look...

618
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:05,480
so great together.

619
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,380
So, that is why I think we should also...

620
00:59:10,949 --> 00:59:12,150
I am not sure.

621
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:14,920
I have already been married once.

622
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:21,599
Did you not say so before yourself?

623
00:59:22,599 --> 00:59:26,400
Why should we have to be bound
by the formalities of marriage?

624
00:59:27,639 --> 00:59:31,039
We can just live a life of passion
with each other,

625
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:32,409
can we not?

626
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:35,610
We are already living passionately,

627
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:37,280
so I do not see why...

628
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:40,320
That is right. Sure.

629
00:59:41,849 --> 00:59:44,289
I did. Yes.

630
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:46,920
I did.

631
00:59:48,019 --> 00:59:49,659
I was flabbergasted at the time,

632
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:51,860
but you sure are right.

633
00:59:53,329 --> 00:59:54,530
I also do not like...

634
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,599
things that are too obvious.

635
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,500
I also...

636
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,670
do not like things that are obvious.

637
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:06,239
I am not such an obvious man.

638
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:07,840
Of course, I am not.

639
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:19,050
Let me see your ring.

640
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:21,289
What?

641
01:00:22,659 --> 01:00:24,030
Why do you want my ring?

642
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,090
Will you take back what you gave?

643
01:00:28,099 --> 01:00:29,230
Here you go.

644
01:00:45,349 --> 01:00:48,250
I will have to inscribe
a nice saying on these.

645
01:00:54,059 --> 01:00:55,659
So, without being too obvious,

646
01:00:57,829 --> 01:00:59,329
I will do it.

647
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:01,800
The proposal.

648
01:01:11,539 --> 01:01:13,269
Marry me.

649
01:01:16,679 --> 01:01:18,349
I will make you...

650
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:24,719
the happiest man in the world.

651
01:02:11,099 --> 01:02:12,599
Let us go to Neunggun-ri.

652
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:17,610
Let us go...

653
01:02:20,539 --> 01:02:21,909
and live like...

654
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:27,849
rocks and grass there.

655
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:32,320
Like trivial things.

656
01:02:33,989 --> 01:02:35,219
Like boring things.

657
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:38,389
Just the two of us.

658
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:01,849
(My Dearest)

659
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:52,000
Let me tell you about Lee Jang Hyun.

660
01:03:52,170 --> 01:03:53,969
Round up all the rebels.

661
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:55,840
Jang Hyun, soldiers are on their way here.

662
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:58,039
I will be sure to come and get you.
Wait for me.

663
01:03:58,239 --> 01:03:59,940
Please help Interpreter Lee.

664
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:01,480
He will die if you arrest him.

665
01:04:01,539 --> 01:04:02,710
Get them!

666
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,880
Please save me.

667
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:06,809
I will live as if I am dead.

668
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:08,980
The leaders of the rebels
have all been wiped out.

669
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:10,690
I have destroyed their traces as well.

670
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:12,019
This is it.

671
01:04:12,019 --> 01:04:13,389
This is Neunggun-ri.

672
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:15,190
What about your husband-to-be?

673
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:16,519
He will be here soon.

674
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:18,230
He promised he would come.
