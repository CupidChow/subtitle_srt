1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,410
(This drama is a work of fiction
created based on historical facts.)

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,080
(Most of the details and depictions
of the characters are fictional.)

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,349
Lady Gil Chae...

4
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:12,320
I mean, Lady Yoo...

5
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:17,660
She is in Simyang.

6
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,439
Jong Jong.

7
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,549
Jong Jong.

8
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:06,140
Right.

9
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,269
Ryang Eum must have been mistaken.

10
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:10,439
Her husband is an officer.

11
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,609
There is no way she would be
in a place like this.

12
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:15,549
How could she be here?

13
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,590
You will not get
such a fine one elsewhere.

14
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,989
She is a real Joseon noblewoman.

15
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,290
Her skin is fair.

16
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:30,329
She has a scar,
but everything else is fine.

17
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,400
The perfect rare item!

18
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,599
Her price...

19
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,700
starts at 30 nyang.

20
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:40,099
Name your price.

21
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,500
I keep seeing things.

22
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,490
What are you doing?

23
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,159
Pay up if you want the girl!

24
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,430
Why are you...

25
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,180
Why...

26
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
are you...

27
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:49,660
How?

28
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:54,170
Why?

29
00:04:58,569 --> 00:04:59,600
Why?

30
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,610
This rat!

31
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:13,790
My lord.

32
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:15,550
My lord!

33
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:17,490
My lord!

34
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,259
Lord Lee!

35
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,600
My lord.

36
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,170
My lord!

37
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,009
My lord.

38
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:43,110
Lord Lee!

39
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:49,149
My lord.

40
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:51,259
My lord!

41
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,819
My lord!

42
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,829
My lord.

43
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,360
My lord.

44
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:18,079
(My Dearest)

45
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,560
(Episode 14)

46
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,329
I knew this would happen.

47
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:39,199
You would risk everything for Lady Yoo.

48
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,709
Where is she?

49
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,079
I made sure they would not sell her.

50
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,649
Get your wound treated and go see her.

51
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,829
Madam.

52
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,699
Since when have you been here?

53
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:14,610
Who is your madam?

54
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,339
Leave at once.

55
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
Go...

56
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,649
and tell Interpreter Lee
to pretend he never saw me.

57
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,329
It has been a while since
she was brought to the slave market.

58
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,399
She was sold to someone
but was sent back to the market...

59
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,699
because she ripped her master's ear.

60
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,000
Jong Jong has been sold
to a faraway place.

61
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:58,350
I suggest you leave at dawn.

62
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:00,850
The sooner I leave,
the sooner she can return.

63
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,019
I am leaving.

64
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:07,430
Do not worry.

65
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:11,500
I will be sure
to bring Jong Jong back with me.

66
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:37,019
Come out.

67
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,750
This one is a rare item. I have never
sent her out for these things before.

68
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,990
Therefore,

69
00:09:12,289 --> 00:09:13,320
she is expensive.

70
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:16,629
Ten nyang.

71
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:21,399
Fifteen nyang
if you wish to keep her all night.

72
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:48,690
I never thought we would meet again
in a place like this.

73
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,070
What happened in Joseon?

74
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:02,710
You should have lived a good life.

75
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:06,740
The kind of life you can boast about.

76
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,090
More importantly,

77
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:18,490
how come you did not look for me?

78
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,889
You knew I was in Simyang.

79
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:27,570
Why did you choose to suffer like this
instead of coming to me?

80
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Why should I look for you?

81
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,110
I have no reason to ask you for help.

82
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:36,809
The two of us...

83
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,080
We are nothing.

84
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,289
Did you...

85
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:53,190
pay him...

86
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,889
to buy me up for the night?

87
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,600
You are no different, after all.

88
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,639
Then...

89
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,870
what shall I do for you?

90
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,409
Shall I pour you a drink?

91
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:16,149
Or shall I sing and dance for you?

92
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,350
Or...

93
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:21,490
Is it something else that you are after?

94
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,440
Even if you show me kindness,

95
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,309
I cannot repay you.

96
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:44,840
So...

97
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,850
do not do anything.

98
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:54,850
It makes me uncomfortable.

99
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,129
No.

100
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,870
This time,
I am not going to do what you want.

101
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,169
I am going to do...

102
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,649
what I want.

103
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,480
Did you have a good time?

104
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,289
But the thing is, I have changed my mind.

105
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,990
I do not think I can sell that woman.

106
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:13,000
You are not going to sell her...

107
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:15,169
all of a sudden?

108
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:18,039
Well, that is up to me.

109
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,039
If you really want to buy her,

110
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,809
give me 200 nyang.

111
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,509
In the past, she ran away...

112
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:29,679
and hurt one of my right-hand men.

113
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,919
If you think of his medical costs,

114
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,549
I should be asking for 300 nyang.

115
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:41,990
No.

116
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:43,389
No!

117
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,799
Actually, I should not sell her.
I should keep her here.

118
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,029
I am not selling her.

119
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,269
Think about it...

120
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,809
again.

121
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,889
I cannot sell her.

122
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,659
I will not.

123
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,669
Is that so?

124
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,250
I am also...

125
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,289
a merchant.

126
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,059
Since you worked hard to earn your money,

127
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,399
I will not take any of your money.

128
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,210
However,

129
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:38,679
if I give you money,

130
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:45,750
you must...

131
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,350
hand over the captive.

132
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:56,159
If you do not,

133
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,269
I will take her with me
after shoving the money into your eyes.

134
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,870
All right.

135
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,740
They will all be up for sale.

136
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,649
Take everyone with you.

137
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:38,399
You can come out.

138
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,200
Go.

139
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,340
Get out!

140
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:45,909
Get out.

141
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:48,809
This way.

142
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:49,879
Hurry up!

143
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:45,470
Let us go.

144
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,259
It is strange.

145
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,769
I am always with you...

146
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,240
when the moon is bright.

147
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:58,440
I am not sure
where it all started to go wrong.

148
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:02,910
Was it...

149
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,019
when I left you alone...

150
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:17,920
and went to Namhan Fortress?

151
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,059
Or was it...

152
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:29,400
when I left you alone...

153
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,269
and went...

154
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,569
to Simyang?

155
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,150
Or...

156
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:48,920
was it...

157
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,369
when you left me?

158
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,170
As soon as we get a certificate
from the Qing's financial office,

159
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,069
your release will be finalized.

160
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:51,619
So,

161
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:57,390
do not worry about a thing.

162
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:03,289
Do not...

163
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,960
worry about a thing.

164
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,809
Do you feel okay?

165
00:23:25,109 --> 00:23:26,480
I am fine.

166
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,180
Did I...

167
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:33,450
perhaps make a mistake?

168
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:43,160
I will get ready to go
to the financial office.

169
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,329
(Hobu: the office in charge of
the country's financial affairs)

170
00:23:44,329 --> 00:23:47,529
Oh, and I will bring you
a change of clothes.

171
00:23:47,829 --> 00:23:49,000
Wait here for a bit.

172
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,970
Thanks.

173
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:54,500
Thank you.

174
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,490
No.

175
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,589
I am grateful to you.

176
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,019
What are you doing?

177
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:45,819
Hey.

178
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:50,559
Had I known this would happen,

179
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,500
I would have brought
some silk clothes from Joseon.

180
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,740
These clothes are from Joseon.

181
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:01,000
I thought she might need them.

182
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:19,089
Thank you.

183
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,029
I feel as though you can see
right through me.

184
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,710
Lady Yoo.

185
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,920
Lady Yoo, I am coming in.

186
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,430
The woman has been sold elsewhere.

187
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,299
They took her away just now.

188
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:12,410
This is...

189
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,509
I will give this back.

190
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:26,920
What are you trying to pull?

191
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,390
I mean, a royal wanted to buy her.

192
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:31,799
How can I say no?

193
00:26:56,089 --> 00:26:57,319
She is nothing special.

194
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:02,630
Why did he want to buy you
by paying so much money?

195
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:03,990
Your Highness.

196
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,460
Interpreter Lee Jang Hyun is here.

197
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,920
Lai.

198
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,940
Your Highness.

199
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,380
Did you come to see me,

200
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,750
or...

201
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:00,079
did you come to find that woman?

202
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,220
I am sorry,

203
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,589
but I meant to release that woman
and send her back to Joseon...

204
00:28:06,589 --> 00:28:07,589
No.

205
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,190
Now,

206
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:13,059
you will not be able to do so.

207
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,069
She is already my servant.

208
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,500
Whether she lives or dies...

209
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,769
is up to me.

210
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,849
Joseon captives are so pitiful.

211
00:28:33,819 --> 00:28:37,089
From what I hear, Joseon women
who get sold to Qing households...

212
00:28:37,089 --> 00:28:38,589
are envied by the wives.

213
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:41,930
The wives pour hot water on them
and ruin their faces.

214
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:45,900
Do you want a servant
who listens to you well?

215
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:47,829
I will find one for you.

216
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:51,170
You can tell me anything you need...

217
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,369
This is not like you.

218
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,470
You were always so relaxed that
I could not tell what you were thinking.

219
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:00,309
But today, you are so anxious.

220
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,150
Since you are this desperate,

221
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,119
it makes me want to refuse
her release even more.

222
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:09,890
Oh, right.

223
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,920
What if I present that woman
to His Majesty?

224
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:18,359
It just so happens Royal Concubine Shin,
His Majesty's favorite, died recently.

225
00:29:18,829 --> 00:29:20,759
He has been ever so down since.

226
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,200
(Royal Concubine Shin:
Hong Taiji's royal concubine)

227
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,069
Your Highness.

228
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:35,150
In the old days, a great emperor had...

229
00:29:35,349 --> 00:29:37,250
a precious only daughter.

230
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:41,650
But when the princess fell in love
with a lowly warrior,

231
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,049
the emperor became angry...

232
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,019
and decided to test the princess' love.

233
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:52,700
He had the warrior choose
between two doors.

234
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,869
Behind the door on the right,
there was a beautiful woman.

235
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,970
And behind the other door,

236
00:29:59,869 --> 00:30:01,539
there was a hungry beast.

237
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,839
Then, he told the princess...

238
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:10,549
to choose which door
she would lead the warrior to.

239
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,680
In order to save the warrior,

240
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:17,950
she had to point at the door
with the beautiful woman.

241
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,390
But then, the princess...

242
00:30:21,259 --> 00:30:25,160
had to go through the pain of watching
her beloved end up with another woman.

243
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,400
If she led him to the other door,

244
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,539
the man would have been torn to shreds
and killed by the lion.

245
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,210
What would you do?

246
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,220
For me,

247
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:52,160
I would rather see him
get ripped to shreds by the lion.

248
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:55,019
I do not let other women...

249
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:57,660
steal the man I want away from me.

250
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,690
I went to the Emperor's Palace...

251
00:31:29,789 --> 00:31:32,559
and brought a maid
who is most fluent in both languages.

252
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:34,759
I am honored to meet Your Highness.

253
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:39,670
Very well.

254
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:43,170
You are to relay my words to her.

255
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,549
I heard you had been sold several times.
It must have been hard.

256
00:31:50,849 --> 00:31:53,680
She says you must have had a hard time.

257
00:31:55,819 --> 00:31:56,890
Yes.

258
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:58,490
I have been through a lot.

259
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,930
Who cares? She does not understand
what I am saying anyway.

260
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,029
Yes. She says she has been through a lot.

261
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:12,599
Chastity is very important
to Joseon women.

262
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,670
I was told they would take their own lives
when taken prisoner.

263
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:18,269
How come...

264
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,079
you are still alive?

265
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,549
Did you not have the courage
to kill yourself?

266
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:25,519
She is asking
why you did not take your own life...

267
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,750
when you were taken prisoner.

268
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,490
Whether I die or not,
it is none of your business.

269
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,599
Someone made a lot of effort
to save my life.

270
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:49,269
For that person's sake,

271
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:50,670
I will persevere and survive,
no matter what.

272
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,410
If you kill me,

273
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,650
you will pay for it too.

274
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,789
She did not have the courage to die.

275
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:11,460
She is much obliged to Your Highness
for kindly taking her in.

276
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,210
You have a foul mouth.

277
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:53,140
Do you know Da Jim?

278
00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:58,670
Do you?

279
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:17,489
I do not need it!

280
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:24,800
I put you in charge...

281
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,840
of all matters regarding Joseon.

282
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,570
How come we still have not received
the military provisions from Joseon?

283
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,039
They said the rice was ready.

284
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,809
However,

285
00:34:35,309 --> 00:34:36,550
they do not have
enough workers and wagons.

286
00:34:38,349 --> 00:34:39,980
We have not captured Songshan yet!

287
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:44,190
If the provisions do not arrive,

288
00:34:44,789 --> 00:34:46,289
we cannot finish the job.

289
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,289
Get the provisions...

290
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,860
from Joseon at once...

291
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,000
and send them to the battlefield.

292
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:09,380
His Majesty says
to send the provisions at once.

293
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,710
How come there are still no updates?

294
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,150
By any chance,

295
00:35:14,449 --> 00:35:16,349
is it because
Joseon does not want Qing to win?

296
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,860
Does Joseon still serve Ming?

297
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:25,260
We cannot transport 5,000 seok of rice
immediately.

298
00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:27,559
We need 60 rolls of cotton...

299
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,329
just to transport one seok of rice.

300
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,630
If we were to transport 5,000 seok
at once,

301
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,869
we would need hundreds of horses...

302
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,940
and hundreds of wagons.

303
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:38,909
Dozens of Joseon men froze to death...

304
00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:40,639
while transporting provisions previously,

305
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:43,280
and over a hundred horses
died from exhaustion.

306
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,619
His Majesty says,

307
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,050
if the provisions do not arrive
by the promised date,

308
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,320
Qing will not accept them...

309
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,820
even if they do arrive after that date.

310
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:56,559
Did he say there would be "consequences"
to threaten me again?

311
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:02,030
I understand I am held hostage here,
but I am still the Crown Prince of Joseon.

312
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:05,570
My fate decides when I will die,

313
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:08,340
so do not threaten me like that.

314
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:09,639
His Majesty said...

315
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:12,139
Your Highness, I have a suggestion.

316
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,679
A mere interpreter should not step in!

317
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:18,949
How about we send Yiju's rice
to Jinzhou first?

318
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,250
After that,
we can send Joseon's rice to Yiju.

319
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:23,889
If we do that,

320
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:26,789
we will need less wagons and cows,

321
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:30,130
and we will be able
to meet the deadline as well.

322
00:36:36,969 --> 00:36:39,599
If we send Yiju's rice to Jinzhou first,

323
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:43,440
we would not have to worry about wagons
and horses, which will be helpful.

324
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:46,610
However, I doubt that
Geng Zhongming would agree to do it.

325
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:49,880
I will persuade Geng Zhongming myself.

326
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,949
However,

327
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,550
I have a favor to ask of you,
Your Highness.

328
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,719
Qing's princess took in a Joseon woman
as her slave.

329
00:37:00,989 --> 00:37:02,590
Please kindly help that woman...

330
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:06,500
return to Joseon.

331
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:11,630
Qing has a custom where a subordinate
who made a significant contribution...

332
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:14,369
is given one of the master's women
as a reward.

333
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:17,039
Sending provisions...

334
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:19,309
and catching runaway slaves...

335
00:37:19,309 --> 00:37:21,940
are some of the things
that Khan greatly values,

336
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:24,309
so if the provisions arrive on time,

337
00:37:24,449 --> 00:37:26,920
Khan will be very pleased.

338
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,789
When that happens,

339
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:33,860
could Your Highness ask him to release...

340
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,489
one of the Princess' maids?

341
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:38,360
A maid?

342
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,030
What are you talking about?

343
00:37:40,829 --> 00:37:42,599
We cannot do that.

344
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,769
If His Majesty in Joseon finds out,

345
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:48,940
His Highness will be scolded
for indulging in women in Simyang.

346
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:52,139
It is simply about
releasing a mere female slave.

347
00:37:52,409 --> 00:37:55,010
If it is not recorded in the report
being sent to Joseon...

348
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:57,050
I cannot lie to His Majesty.

349
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:00,349
This is so unlike you.

350
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,420
What is with the rush?

351
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:03,889
Your Highness.

352
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:08,420
Do you know who this woman is?

353
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,860
She is the one...

354
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,760
who saved...

355
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,300
your first son in the Year of Byeongja.

356
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,639
That day,

357
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:22,670
the eunuchs
taking care of your first son all died.

358
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,809
I heard a woman risked her life
to save him...

359
00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:26,239
and took him to the boat.

360
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:27,780
And that woman...

361
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,510
got caught as a runaway slave?

362
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,719
The Princess is planning
to send her to Khan as a gift?

363
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,320
Yes, Your Highness.

364
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:42,429
I hear Qing's women
often abuse Joseon slaves...

365
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,659
out of jealousy.

366
00:38:46,059 --> 00:38:48,130
If even commoners' wives
and mistresses do that,

367
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:51,070
think about what
the Emperor's royal concubines would do.

368
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,940
If...

369
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:57,039
Khan shows any interest in her,

370
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,610
she...

371
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,909
will not survive.

372
00:39:04,449 --> 00:39:05,610
So please,

373
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,849
before Khan gets her,

374
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:10,590
we must get her released no matter what.

375
00:39:12,289 --> 00:39:16,130
Thankfully, he is staying
at the hot spring at the moment...

376
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:18,329
to recuperate from the Songshan War,

377
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:20,599
so we still have some time.

378
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,139
Your Highness.

379
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,539
I will...

380
00:39:29,969 --> 00:39:32,510
persuade Geng Zhongming at all costs.

381
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,309
Please help her...

382
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:40,050
get released.

383
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:52,389
Da Jim?

384
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,360
Grandpa Duk Chul's grandson, Da Jim?

385
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,699
Yes.

386
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,070
Where is he?

387
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:00,699
Where is Da Jim now?

388
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,809
Da Jim is staying at my house in Joseon.

389
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,079
Thank you.

390
00:40:09,579 --> 00:40:10,650
Thank you.

391
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,849
Thank you.

392
00:40:16,949 --> 00:40:18,789
What is your relationship
with Interpreter Lee?

393
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:23,889
His Majesty's favorite princess
bought you up.

394
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,199
The Princess...

395
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,659
seems to have feelings
for Interpreter Lee.

396
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,630
She said she would destroy him...

397
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,840
if he tried to protect you.

398
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:04,170
Lady Yoo.

399
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,300
My lord.

400
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:15,539
Did you wait here all night?

401
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,610
I saw your face, so I am good.

402
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,090
I will be gone for a few days
on a mission given by the Crown Prince.

403
00:41:23,389 --> 00:41:25,489
So even if you do not see me
for a few days,

404
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,820
do not worry.

405
00:41:29,059 --> 00:41:30,929
Will it be dangerous?

406
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:34,159
Not at all.

407
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:36,570
Well, then.

408
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:46,079
Her Highness is benevolent.

409
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:50,050
My life here is not even comparable
to the slave market I was at before.

410
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,250
So, my lord,

411
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:57,489
do not do anything...

412
00:41:58,519 --> 00:41:59,820
for me.

413
00:42:01,059 --> 00:42:02,159
I am begging you.

414
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:19,840
All right.

415
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,550
I will do as you wish.

416
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,750
Do not worry about anything.

417
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,590
You do not have to worry.

418
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:38,659
Goodbye.

419
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,210
Geng Zhongming has always been
closely acquainted with Joseon, right?

420
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,880
Yes, General.

421
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:01,849
The result of the war
depends on the provisions.

422
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,590
His Majesty was deeply injured...

423
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:06,059
while fighting in the war
to conquer Songshan.

424
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:08,119
His Majesty spilled blood
on that battlefield.

425
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:10,130
So...

426
00:43:10,659 --> 00:43:12,059
we must conquer Songshan.

427
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,530
If you do not accomplish this mission,

428
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:19,570
neither you...

429
00:43:19,969 --> 00:43:21,699
nor the Crown Prince of Joseon
will be safe.

430
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,829
Officer Gu.

431
00:43:46,329 --> 00:43:47,530
What brings you here?

432
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:50,599
I just had something to say
regarding Lady Yoo.

433
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,539
Since you are busy
with government affairs,

434
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:56,139
I was thinking I should go to Simyang.

435
00:43:59,809 --> 00:44:01,909
If another man goes to find my wife,

436
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:03,780
what would other people think?

437
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:06,119
Do you think that will help my wife?

438
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,019
This has to do with my family.

439
00:44:09,019 --> 00:44:10,219
It is none of your business.

440
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:17,690
I sent someone to Simyang.

441
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:21,130
We will probably hear some good news soon.

442
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:48,219
I am sorry.

443
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:51,260
I have no energy these days.

444
00:44:51,659 --> 00:44:53,329
It is because
you are not getting enough sleep.

445
00:44:53,929 --> 00:44:55,559
The living has to go on living.

446
00:44:58,769 --> 00:45:00,840
Officer Gu sent someone to Simyang.

447
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,639
So let us wait for now.

448
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,940
She has a husband,

449
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:08,940
so I cannot go and bring her back.

450
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:12,409
I know.

451
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,250
Gil Chae will be back.

452
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,320
My lord.

453
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:26,099
When we used to live in Neunggun-ri,

454
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,869
all of my friends
wanted to hang out with me.

455
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:35,170
But for me,

456
00:45:36,269 --> 00:45:38,769
I had the most fun
when I was with Gil Chae.

457
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:42,809
Gil Chae...

458
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:45,150
was easily jealous...

459
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:47,519
and greedy,

460
00:45:50,019 --> 00:45:51,349
but also warmhearted.

461
00:45:53,889 --> 00:45:55,619
She was filled with all types of emotions,

462
00:45:56,829 --> 00:45:59,130
which made her bouncy and full of life,

463
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:01,630
which I liked about her.

464
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:07,199
Also,

465
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:12,510
Gil Chae was my lifesaver.

466
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:14,809
Yes.

467
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:18,650
Thanks to Lady Yoo, we were all
able to avoid starving to death.

468
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:21,150
(Hogu: just barely having enough to eat)

469
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:22,380
That is not what I mean.

470
00:46:25,389 --> 00:46:27,760
She actually saved my life.

471
00:46:39,539 --> 00:46:41,300
If it was not for Gil Chae,

472
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,570
I would practically be dead.

473
00:46:47,309 --> 00:46:48,579
If it were Gil Chae,

474
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:54,519
she would have gone
to Simyang herself to rescue me.

475
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,389
Definitely.

476
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,989
If it were Gil Chae, she would have.

477
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,860
But...

478
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,000
there is nothing I can do.

479
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,780
Gil Chae is probably dead.

480
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,789
You are here.

481
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,829
Please accept me as your student.

482
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:20,599
Why do you want to be a student of mine?

483
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:23,110
I...

484
00:48:23,769 --> 00:48:25,570
admire your virtue and wisdom...

485
00:48:35,719 --> 00:48:36,789
Actually,

486
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,789
I admire your power.

487
00:48:41,389 --> 00:48:43,030
Thousands of bags of rice
and thousands of soldiers...

488
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:44,889
are being sent to Qing
from Joseon in a year.

489
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:47,500
Many porters freeze...

490
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,670
and starve to death on the way there.

491
00:48:52,369 --> 00:48:55,039
And hundreds of soldiers died
due to another country's war.

492
00:48:56,039 --> 00:48:58,239
No one knows when this war will end.

493
00:49:00,739 --> 00:49:02,239
I went to Pyeongan Island
a few days ago...

494
00:49:03,309 --> 00:49:05,480
and heard the screams of our people.

495
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:09,280
Even when they were deprived
of their rice...

496
00:49:10,389 --> 00:49:13,889
and the head of the household
was taken away, they did not even groan.

497
00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:18,559
But I saw them scream.

498
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:22,460
I cannot do anything
even after seeing their pain.

499
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,070
Even after seeing my lifesaver suffer,

500
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,170
I cannot do anything,

501
00:49:33,409 --> 00:49:35,909
and I feel like a good-for-nothing.
It is hard to bear.

502
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:39,820
If there is anything
that even a man like me can do,

503
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:42,980
I would like to do anything.

504
00:49:44,389 --> 00:49:45,889
For this nation and the people,

505
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:49,090
please accept me...

506
00:49:51,159 --> 00:49:52,829
and use me to become...

507
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:56,030
more than a good-for-nothing.

508
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:09,980
(Yiju, Qing)

509
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:24,159
(Geng Zhongming: a Ming general
who surrendered to Qing)

510
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:27,130
You came to discuss something
regarding the military provisions?

511
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:43,409
I heard you were of high status in Joseon.

512
00:50:44,409 --> 00:50:46,579
You must not have had to serve
someone else before.

513
00:50:50,789 --> 00:50:52,619
If I do not release you,

514
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,690
you will now...

515
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:56,860
live like this for the rest of your life.

516
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,860
In that case, how about...

517
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:07,469
becoming His Majesty's woman instead?

518
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,010
Who knows?

519
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,809
He might treasure you like he did
with Royal Concubine Shin.

520
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,980
If I were to present you to His Majesty,

521
00:51:25,019 --> 00:51:26,420
he might be willing to overlook...

522
00:51:27,059 --> 00:51:29,090
this scar you have on your body.

523
00:51:31,429 --> 00:51:32,690
His Majesty...

524
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,030
cherishes me so much.

525
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,170
If you do not want to,

526
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:41,869
you can be my servant forever...

527
00:51:41,869 --> 00:51:42,969
Yes.

528
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,369
I will serve His Majesty.

529
00:51:50,409 --> 00:51:52,010
I feel sorry...

530
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:53,550
for Lee Jang Hyun.

531
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:58,050
He worked so hard to release this woman
who is nothing special.

532
00:51:59,889 --> 00:52:01,019
A girl like you...

533
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:04,789
will be cast aside after His Majesty
has his way with you a couple of times.

534
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,030
But it will be more than enough...

535
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,800
to make Lee Jang Hyun give up.

536
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,880
You want us to take our rice
to Jinzhou first...

537
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:28,019
and receive Joseon's rice later on?

538
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,519
Yes, General.

539
00:52:30,889 --> 00:52:33,090
The thousands of seok of rice
that you have piled in your palace here...

540
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:35,090
will be eaten by moths
once the new year dawns.

541
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,860
So,

542
00:52:37,289 --> 00:52:40,000
why not send the rice to Jinzhou
before the rice goes bad...

543
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:44,570
and receive fresh rice
from Joseon later on?

544
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,099
His Majesty in Songshan...

545
00:52:47,099 --> 00:52:49,170
will be able to get his provisions
at the right time,

546
00:52:49,969 --> 00:52:52,739
and I will be able to get
fresh rice from Joseon.

547
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:56,280
It will be a win-win for everyone.

548
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:58,280
However,

549
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:00,579
I cannot do so.

550
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:06,190
If I say I will transport
the military provisions...

551
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:08,420
but fail to arrive on time,

552
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:10,130
I will be blamed for it.

553
00:53:10,829 --> 00:53:12,360
I cannot have that.

554
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:15,559
Then will you let your rice rot away?

555
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:17,570
Even if my rice rots,

556
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,139
it will be better
than displeasing His Majesty.

557
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:23,139
I came here from Ming.

558
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:28,010
I cannot make any mistakes
for the time being.

559
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:32,750
General.

560
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:38,389
Do you know why General Yong Gol Dae
came with me?

561
00:53:40,119 --> 00:53:42,289
It was because he did not trust me,
a Joseon man,

562
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:46,059
or you, a general from Ming.

563
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:52,369
Why is he acting that way?

564
00:53:52,969 --> 00:53:54,099
Why was he surprised?

565
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:55,469
I am sure...

566
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:59,340
His Majesty still does not trust you
either after you surrendered from Ming.

567
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,840
They are at war against the Ming,

568
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:05,449
so he may want to keep you by his side,
a man who surrendered from Ming,

569
00:54:05,449 --> 00:54:07,550
and show you off like a trophy.

570
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,519
But...

571
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:12,789
will he still keep you around...

572
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,630
even after the war ends?

573
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,300
Military provisions are...

574
00:54:24,099 --> 00:54:26,969
something His Majesty considers
to be of utmost importance.

575
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:30,110
This is your chance to prove your use...

576
00:54:30,469 --> 00:54:32,039
as a man who came over from Ming.

577
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,380
Will you really miss out on this chance...

578
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:39,150
just because you wanted to avoid
displeasing His Majesty?

579
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,150
Or,

580
00:54:42,349 --> 00:54:44,619
even if you have to take a risk,

581
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:48,159
will you gain His Majesty's trust?

582
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:53,530
What are you talking about?

583
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:54,900
General.

584
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:57,429
How about we do this?

585
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:02,639
Let us pretend that I never came here.

586
00:55:03,869 --> 00:55:05,139
You saw...

587
00:55:05,539 --> 00:55:07,840
His Majesty's struggles...

588
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:10,349
and suggested sending your rice first.

589
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:12,750
If His Majesty...

590
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:14,780
learns of this news,

591
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:19,690
how happy would he be?

592
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:27,159
At the end,

593
00:55:27,159 --> 00:55:28,730
you spoke in the Ming language,
did you not?

594
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:31,530
What did you say?

595
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:33,800
What did you say to him...

596
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:35,500
that he agreed
to transport the provisions...

597
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,340
and even lower the transportation costs...

598
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:38,809
from 500 to 200 nyang?

599
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:42,280
Geng Zhongming is originally from Ming,
so he would understand better...

600
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,280
if I spoke to him in his own language
about such important matters.

601
00:55:45,949 --> 00:55:47,050
Why?

602
00:55:48,619 --> 00:55:51,289
Would you like to try learning
the Ming language this time?

603
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:53,860
You are teasing me.

604
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:06,530
You offered to send Yiju's rice
to Jinzhou...

605
00:56:07,469 --> 00:56:09,900
and be repaid with Uiju's rice?

606
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:12,469
Geng Zhongming.

607
00:56:13,409 --> 00:56:16,409
I was always suspicious of you
since you come from Ming.

608
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,579
You must have finally realized
the Great Qing's power.

609
00:56:24,619 --> 00:56:26,320
Joseon took care of
the military provisions on time.

610
00:56:27,159 --> 00:56:29,619
I would like to praise you for it.

611
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:31,590
If there is anything...

612
00:56:32,329 --> 00:56:34,500
among the spoils of war
brought back from Songshan...

613
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:37,769
that you would like, do tell me.

614
00:56:39,369 --> 00:56:40,570
In that case,

615
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,599
would you be able to let me have...

616
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:43,940
one of the Joseon women
who was brought here as a captive?

617
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:48,780
I see...

618
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:51,579
that you are a man too, Crown Prince.

619
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:00,760
Fine.

620
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:04,460
Which servant girl do you want
as your prize?

621
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:11,869
It is already too late.

622
00:57:14,769 --> 00:57:15,869
What do you mean?

623
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,210
A few days ago,

624
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:20,480
His Majesty already came to meet
Lady Yoo in person.

625
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:29,079
(A few days ago)

626
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:35,519
Gak Hwa.

627
00:57:37,059 --> 00:57:38,389
You went to enjoy the hot springs.

628
00:57:38,389 --> 00:57:40,090
Why do you still look weary?

629
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,230
I cannot rest at the thought
of the military provisions.

630
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:47,400
Please forget about the battlefield
even for a moment.

631
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:49,039
I will...

632
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:51,340
present a woman to console you.

633
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,030
Your Majesty.

634
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,170
I hear you inflicted a wound
on yourself...

635
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:22,170
in order to avoid serving a man in bed.

636
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:24,440
However,

637
00:58:25,469 --> 00:58:27,739
I do not think it is bad that Joseon women
try to protect...

638
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:29,409
their chastity.

639
00:58:30,679 --> 00:58:33,349
I also like how Joseon's vassals
are loyal to their king.

640
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:36,119
I saw before...

641
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:39,789
when Joseon's vassals were hitting
themselves in the head and crying...

642
00:58:40,659 --> 00:58:42,690
because they wanted to save their king
who had lost the war.

643
00:58:44,090 --> 00:58:45,559
If we occupy the ruling position,

644
00:58:46,059 --> 00:58:48,000
my people should learn
that loyalty as well.

645
00:58:58,010 --> 00:59:00,679
It is a great honor to meet Your Majesty.

646
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:06,949
Do you speak our language?

647
00:59:07,449 --> 00:59:09,349
In order to address Your Majesty,

648
00:59:09,719 --> 00:59:11,349
I learned to speak Manchurian.

649
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:15,460
You learned to speak our language...

650
00:59:16,489 --> 00:59:18,059
because you had something to tell me?

651
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:20,599
Fine.

652
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:22,530
What is it you want to say?

653
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,030
Your Majesty.

654
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:25,929
I am not a runaway captive.

655
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:27,940
I have been abducted.

656
00:59:28,139 --> 00:59:30,070
Please help undo this injustice.

657
00:59:31,139 --> 00:59:32,840
So you were not a runaway,

658
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:34,809
but you were abducted?

659
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,250
Yes, Your Majesty.

660
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:39,550
I was never taken captive,

661
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:40,980
and I never ran away as a captive.

662
00:59:41,349 --> 00:59:43,920
I was abducted in Joseon
and was dragged here.

663
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:46,019
I am not the only one.

664
00:59:46,019 --> 00:59:49,489
Countless people were dragged here
when they were not prisoners of war.

665
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:52,929
But no one here understands our language,

666
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,630
so we could not tell anyone about
the unfair treatment we had received.

667
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,500
Also,

668
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,469
once dragged to Simyang, Joseon women...

669
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,699
are abused by the wives of their masters.

670
01:00:04,539 --> 01:00:06,409
They get their fingers severed and burned.

671
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:08,480
There is not a day
when you do not hear them wailing in pain.

672
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:11,280
Your Majesty.

673
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:13,280
You are a fair and just emperor.

674
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,949
Please do not let this injustice...

675
01:00:16,349 --> 01:00:19,219
anger the skies and taint your honor.

676
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:25,829
How brazen.

677
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:29,730
I have met many Joseon women,

678
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:33,500
but none of them learned our language...

679
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:36,639
and spoke to me like this.

680
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:49,150
I heard your wives and concubines...

681
01:00:50,019 --> 01:00:52,619
abused the women from Joseon.

682
01:00:56,389 --> 01:00:57,460
Our soldiers...

683
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:00,630
fought hard
to get those women from Joseon,

684
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,829
but our women are torturing them
by plunging them into hot water,

685
01:01:04,329 --> 01:01:06,429
chopping off their fingers and ears,

686
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,340
and scarring their faces.

687
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:10,369
How ruthless and cruel!

688
01:01:11,139 --> 01:01:12,909
(Prince Yoon)

689
01:01:12,909 --> 01:01:13,980
If...

690
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:18,150
I hear once more that our women
are torturing women from Joseon,

691
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:21,619
those women will be buried alive...

692
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:24,449
as soon as their husbands die,
so let them know.

693
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:32,190
Thanks to her, they are now banned
from abusing women from Joseon.

694
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,030
So every woman from Joseon
is deeply grateful...

695
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:35,929
to Lady Yoo even though
they do not even know what she looks like.

696
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:37,900
However...

697
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:42,969
(A few days ago)

698
01:01:43,239 --> 01:01:44,309
That girl said...

699
01:01:45,409 --> 01:01:46,969
she was never taken captive...

700
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:49,309
and that she was abducted
and dragged here.

701
01:01:49,309 --> 01:01:50,309
Your Majesty.

702
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:52,610
It is true that I sent my men to Joseon...

703
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:54,949
and ordered them to catch
and bring back all the runaways,

704
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:58,150
but I would never abduct someone
who was not our prisoner.

705
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,360
Good.

706
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,829
You never once disobeyed my orders.

707
01:02:12,699 --> 01:02:13,730
Of course,

708
01:02:14,969 --> 01:02:17,139
I would not believe the words
of a mere Joseon girl...

709
01:02:18,309 --> 01:02:20,309
over the words of my loyal subject
who had risked his life for me.

710
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:25,110
Your Majesty!

711
01:02:29,449 --> 01:02:30,650
We own...

712
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:33,650
those captives from Joseon
for our soldiers fought hard to get them.

713
01:02:35,059 --> 01:02:37,059
Whoever pays up to buy them
can become their master.

714
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:39,590
Now, about that girl...

715
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:43,030
Take care of her however you want.

716
01:02:44,570 --> 01:02:45,599
Yes, Your Majesty.

717
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:15,829
As for Lady Yoo,

718
01:03:16,429 --> 01:03:17,730
the Princess took her again,

719
01:03:17,730 --> 01:03:19,170
and I do not know whether she is alive.

720
01:03:40,489 --> 01:03:41,519
Let go of him.

721
01:04:05,309 --> 01:04:06,349
Your Highness.

722
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:13,650
Please punish me.

723
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:19,489
Punish me instead of her.

724
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:23,329
If you tell me to scrub your feet,

725
01:04:25,369 --> 01:04:26,469
I will.

726
01:04:28,469 --> 01:04:30,369
If you tell me...

727
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,110
to become your servant in her stead,

728
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:38,050
I will be your servant.

729
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:40,750
So please...

730
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:43,920
let her...

731
01:04:50,889 --> 01:04:51,960
Or, at least...

732
01:04:54,659 --> 01:04:56,099
tell me where she is.

733
01:04:58,329 --> 01:04:59,500
Is that woman...

734
01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:01,199
still alive?

735
01:05:03,670 --> 01:05:04,670
Your Highness.

736
01:05:05,269 --> 01:05:07,010
If you do me a favor,

737
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,179
I may be able to tell you where she is.

738
01:05:12,349 --> 01:05:15,750
Remember the day
when we went hunting together?

739
01:05:17,349 --> 01:05:18,389
That day,

740
01:05:20,219 --> 01:05:21,420
it was very nice.

741
01:05:25,059 --> 01:05:28,000
Would you go hunting with me again?

742
01:05:31,329 --> 01:05:32,530
Is that all?

743
01:05:34,539 --> 01:05:35,869
But this time we go hunting,

744
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:39,309
you will have to put your life
on the line.

745
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:42,110
Will you still do it?

746
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:45,179
A hunting trip, where you have to...

747
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:47,849
put your life on the line?

748
01:05:49,849 --> 01:05:51,920
There is definitely something.
I have a bad feeling about this.

749
01:05:52,519 --> 01:05:53,789
Let us not go. Please?

750
01:05:55,559 --> 01:05:57,059
Must you do this?

751
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:00,630
I was the one who told you
about Lady Yoo being dragged here.

752
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,829
Must you make me regret it
until the day I die?

753
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:12,769
Why should you regret it?

754
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:15,809
You saved me.

755
01:06:20,349 --> 01:06:21,820
If something bad happens to her...

756
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:29,989
I will die.

757
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:42,840
Please stop him.

758
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,969
He may listen to you.

759
01:06:45,309 --> 01:06:46,309
Quit trying.

760
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:50,309
It is not like
Jang Hyun will not do something...

761
01:06:50,579 --> 01:06:52,480
just because
someone says he should not do it.

762
01:06:54,150 --> 01:06:55,880
If things go wrong, he will die.

763
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:08,460
I remember the day...

764
01:07:09,699 --> 01:07:12,070
when you and Jang Hyun first came to me.

765
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,440
Jang Hyun...

766
01:07:18,039 --> 01:07:20,739
was holding your hand tightly.

767
01:07:23,179 --> 01:07:24,309
You were...

768
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,309
very fond of Jang Hyun.

769
01:07:28,849 --> 01:07:31,889
You always listened to him
and did as he said.

770
01:07:35,889 --> 01:07:38,559
And Jang Hyun truly cherished you as well.

771
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:41,329
But...

772
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:43,630
to Jang Hyun,

773
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:46,269
you are like his little brother.

774
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:50,969
Do not get greedy.

775
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:56,539
I...

776
01:08:01,449 --> 01:08:02,480
I will not dare...

777
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:08,889
to let myself get greedy.

778
01:08:12,090 --> 01:08:13,190
I am just afraid.

779
01:08:16,899 --> 01:08:19,399
I have never seen him do this
because of a woman.

780
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:20,630
Then you should have turned a blind eye.

781
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:22,670
Why did you tell him?

782
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,340
Because if something bad happens to her...

783
01:08:28,779 --> 01:08:29,810
Jang Hyun...

784
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:35,119
I was afraid something bad would happen
to Jang Hyun too.

785
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:43,420
Okay, you did the right thing.

786
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:45,630
But...

787
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:48,600
if Jang Hyun loves her that much,

788
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:50,500
there is nothing...

789
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:52,600
we can do about it.

790
01:09:10,819 --> 01:09:12,750
His Majesty heard all about your story...

791
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:14,189
and ordered you to be released.

792
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:17,659
You can return to Joseon now.

793
01:09:19,529 --> 01:09:20,930
Really?

794
01:09:21,659 --> 01:09:22,699
Yes.

795
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,170
But there is one condition.

796
01:09:35,010 --> 01:09:36,710
Leave Simyang right away.

797
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:38,680
You must not meet...

798
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:40,149
any Joseon person including Lee Jang Hyun.

799
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,649
If...

800
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:44,850
you meet Lee Jang Hyun again,

801
01:09:45,319 --> 01:09:46,949
Lee Jang Hyun will have to suffer greatly.

802
01:09:59,869 --> 01:10:02,600
The road back to Joseon will be rough.

803
01:10:03,739 --> 01:10:05,670
Since you cannot receive
any help from Interpreter Lee,

804
01:10:05,970 --> 01:10:07,109
take this.

805
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:14,279
Thank you.

806
01:10:15,649 --> 01:10:17,119
No, I should thank you.

807
01:10:17,649 --> 01:10:20,220
Thank you for taking in Da Jim.

808
01:10:27,130 --> 01:10:28,430
You have to go back safely.

809
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:30,229
Please go and tell Da Jim...

810
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:33,770
that his mom will be there to meet him.

811
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:37,340
That I have not forgotten about him...

812
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:39,470
for a single day.

813
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:51,420
Okay.

814
01:10:52,819 --> 01:10:54,250
I will make sure I tell him,

815
01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:56,420
no matter what.

816
01:10:59,430 --> 01:11:00,560
Thank you.

817
01:11:26,189 --> 01:11:27,520
Once I leave,

818
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:30,619
we probably will not ever meet again.

819
01:11:32,329 --> 01:11:33,829
But that is...

820
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,100
what will be best for you.

821
01:12:12,229 --> 01:12:13,369
So,

822
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:15,039
you sent her off along with money?

823
01:12:17,039 --> 01:12:18,109
Good job.

824
01:12:24,079 --> 01:12:25,479
How did you know...

825
01:12:26,210 --> 01:12:27,449
I gave her money?

826
01:13:07,319 --> 01:13:08,619
Greetings, Your Highness.

827
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,529
Are you ready to hunt?

828
01:13:13,829 --> 01:13:14,930
Yes, Your Highness.

829
01:13:15,529 --> 01:13:16,930
And to risk your life?

830
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:21,739
Yes, Your Highness.

831
01:13:22,539 --> 01:13:23,600
Good.

832
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:39,289
Did you not call me to hunt?

833
01:13:39,319 --> 01:13:40,420
I did.

834
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:42,420
We will be hunting down a captive.

835
01:13:44,529 --> 01:13:45,789
That woman...

836
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:48,199
over there.

837
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,649
That captive betrayed her owner...

838
01:14:04,649 --> 01:14:06,479
and ran away after stealing her riches.

839
01:14:07,949 --> 01:14:09,979
His Majesty has given us permission...

840
01:14:10,119 --> 01:14:11,920
to kill any captives who run away.

841
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:32,210
Then...

842
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:34,909
shall I inform you of the rules?

843
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:40,109
Whoever catches her first,

844
01:14:40,579 --> 01:14:41,750
wins.

845
01:14:43,579 --> 01:14:44,850
If I win,

846
01:14:45,289 --> 01:14:47,020
both you and the woman will live.

847
01:14:47,390 --> 01:14:48,489
However,

848
01:14:49,319 --> 01:14:51,430
that woman will be my slave
for the rest of her life.

849
01:14:54,359 --> 01:14:56,029
If you win,

850
01:14:59,970 --> 01:15:01,569
I will let her go.

851
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,100
But instead,

852
01:15:07,039 --> 01:15:08,210
you will die.

853
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:21,789
Will you make the choice
for both of you to live,

854
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:26,260
or will you choose to die?

855
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:28,899
Your Highness.

856
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:31,000
Do you think
I will not be able to kill you?

857
01:15:35,369 --> 01:15:36,970
There is one thing
I have not told you yet.

858
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:42,439
My husband who never came for me...

859
01:15:45,810 --> 01:15:47,050
I killed him.

860
01:16:03,029 --> 01:16:04,260
You can go first.

861
01:16:20,449 --> 01:16:21,619
Lady Yoo!

862
01:16:30,859 --> 01:16:32,130
Lady Yoo!

863
01:16:35,829 --> 01:16:36,930
Lady Yoo!

864
01:16:38,329 --> 01:16:39,399
Lady Yoo!

865
01:16:40,569 --> 01:16:41,800
Lady Yoo!

866
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,199
My lord.

867
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:48,739
If...

868
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:51,140
you meet Lee Jang Hyun again,

869
01:16:51,579 --> 01:16:53,180
Lee Jang Hyun will have to suffer greatly.

870
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:00,050
Do not come close.

871
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:03,890
Lady Yoo!

872
01:17:09,329 --> 01:17:10,399
Lady Yoo!

873
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:17,439
Lady Yoo!

874
01:17:18,810 --> 01:17:20,039
Lady Yoo!

875
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:24,850
No!

876
01:17:25,409 --> 01:17:26,649
Gil Chae!

877
01:17:34,119 --> 01:17:35,460
Gil Chae!

878
01:17:36,359 --> 01:17:37,590
Gil Chae!

879
01:17:38,930 --> 01:17:40,359
Gil Chae!

880
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:42,829
Young Master Jang Hyun.

881
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:51,670
No!

882
01:17:53,409 --> 01:17:54,779
No! Gil Chae!

883
01:17:58,149 --> 01:17:59,479
Gil Chae!

884
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:05,319
No!

885
01:18:09,659 --> 01:18:10,960
No!

886
01:18:14,130 --> 01:18:15,329
Gil Chae!

887
01:18:29,579 --> 01:18:30,710
No!

888
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:34,380
No!

889
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:11,380
My lord.

890
01:19:28,199 --> 01:19:29,439
I won.

891
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:35,279
It is all good now.

892
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:47,850
My lord.

893
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:55,159
My lord.

894
01:19:57,430 --> 01:19:58,470
My lord.

895
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,569
My lord!

896
01:20:08,409 --> 01:20:09,409
My lord...

897
01:20:11,779 --> 01:20:13,579
My lord.

898
01:20:28,729 --> 01:20:29,800
Why is it...

899
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:33,630
that you risk your life for a mere woman?

900
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,539
Are Joseon men all strange?

901
01:20:40,409 --> 01:20:41,409
Or...

902
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:44,239
is it just this man who is strange?

903
01:21:13,039 --> 01:21:14,069
I am afraid.

904
01:21:16,810 --> 01:21:18,109
I feel like...

905
01:21:22,149 --> 01:21:24,449
something might happen to you
because of that woman.

906
01:21:28,659 --> 01:21:30,619
My instincts are never wrong.

907
01:21:37,159 --> 01:21:38,699
What happened to...

908
01:21:39,829 --> 01:21:41,029
Interpreter Lee?

909
01:21:42,739 --> 01:21:44,039
Did he survive?

910
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:48,380
I had a good experience.

911
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:52,250
For the first time,

912
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:57,119
I learned there is something I cannot have
even if I want it.

913
01:22:02,489 --> 01:22:04,720
What happened to Interpreter Lee?

914
01:22:20,609 --> 01:22:21,609
If...

915
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:24,310
he is dead,

916
01:22:25,109 --> 01:22:26,550
your life will be at risk too.

917
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:32,590
In life, I will follow you wherever you go
and curse you.

918
01:22:34,819 --> 01:22:37,760
In death, I will appear in every one
of your dreams and curse you.

919
01:22:40,229 --> 01:22:42,130
So, Interpreter Lee has to be alive.

920
01:22:44,029 --> 01:22:45,069
Tell me.

921
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:48,300
Tell me where Interpreter Lee is!

922
01:23:00,510 --> 01:23:02,119
Since I have lost the bet,

923
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:05,090
I will release you.

924
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:12,060
The reason I am keeping this promise...

925
01:23:13,329 --> 01:23:15,159
is to win Lee Jang Hyun.

926
01:23:17,399 --> 01:23:18,430
Wait and see.

927
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:21,739
Someday, Lee Jang Hyun...

928
01:23:22,939 --> 01:23:24,239
will be mine.

929
01:23:39,850 --> 01:23:41,390
Are you Lady Yoo?

930
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:47,460
You know Lee Jang Hyun, do you not?

931
01:23:51,699 --> 01:23:52,729
Follow me.

932
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:10,949
Go inside.

933
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:27,250
Lady Yoo.

934
01:26:44,069 --> 01:26:45,140
My lord.

935
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:49,539
I have been released.

936
01:26:53,079 --> 01:26:54,149
This is all...

937
01:26:56,380 --> 01:26:58,020
thanks to you.

938
01:27:34,689 --> 01:27:38,390
(My Dearest)

939
01:28:22,539 --> 01:28:25,369
I have wanted to hold this hand too.

940
01:28:25,770 --> 01:28:27,439
I let you go.

941
01:28:27,439 --> 01:28:28,539
I am sorry.

942
01:28:28,979 --> 01:28:31,279
Have you decided to return to Joseon?

943
01:28:31,409 --> 01:28:33,380
No, I will not leave.

944
01:28:33,449 --> 01:28:35,109
I will stay and help him recover.

945
01:28:35,949 --> 01:28:37,579
- Lady Yoo.
- My lord.

946
01:28:38,689 --> 01:28:39,750
Oh, no.

947
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:41,750
My leg hurts so much.

948
01:28:42,220 --> 01:28:43,390
With his injured leg,

949
01:28:43,390 --> 01:28:45,289
I feel like he is all mine now.

950
01:28:45,390 --> 01:28:46,590
I missed...

951
01:28:46,729 --> 01:28:48,289
your smile.

952
