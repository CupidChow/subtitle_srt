00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,310
(This drama is a work of fiction
created based on historical facts.)

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,980
(Most of the details and depictions
of the characters are fictional.)

3
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:42,109
Did you ever hate me?

4
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:46,619
The day you left me for good,

5
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,719
I resented you so much
that I stared at you for a while.

6
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,829
However, no matter how long I looked,
I did not feel hatred toward you.

7
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,030
Instead, I hated myself.

8
00:00:58,429 --> 00:00:59,899
How cold of you.

9
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,170
Did you even imagine how I must have felt?

10
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:09,239
I could not bear to imagine it.

11
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:12,040
I just...

12
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:16,409
knew that my heart was being torn
into thousands of pieces...

13
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,780
and could only hope
that you would not feel...

14
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,689
the way that I did.

15
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,200
(Episode 18)

16
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,659
You do not seem to be feeling well.

17
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,599
The journey back must have been tiring.

18
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:05,329
No, Father.

19
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:10,300
I did have to stop to rest on the way
from feeling ill,

20
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:12,340
but I am recovering.

21
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,139
Do not worry.

22
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,569
Of course.

23
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,439
Your troubles are over,
so you should regain your health soon.

24
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,150
Your Majesty,

25
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,090
I have something to tell you.

26
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,729
There are some captives
that I released in Simyang.

27
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,599
But I could not bring them this time
because it was an inconvenience.

28
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,469
If you could allow it...

29
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,469
Do you know who the traitor, Sim Ki Won,

30
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:49,310
wanted as the new king at first?

31
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,610
It was you.

32
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,849
I know nothing about it.

33
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,159
I had no idea.

34
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:06,360
I know.

35
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:08,759
I trust you.

36
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,629
However,

37
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:15,129
I hear you gained wealth
by farming in Simyang.

38
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:17,870
Did you buy the captives with that money?

39
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,000
What were you going to use them for?

40
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,569
I used the captives...

41
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,780
for farming and other chores.

42
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:26,580
However,
rather than considering their use,

43
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,180
I just pitied them...

44
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,819
You pitied them?

45
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,349
Was that all?

46
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:41,360
The first thing that Sim Ki Won did
once he started plotting treason...

47
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,960
was to raise a private army.

48
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,530
He gathered strong men
and trained them every day.

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,039
And he spent his money to buy their favor.

50
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,469
By releasing the captives,

51
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,080
you have also bought their favor.

52
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,479
So if you do not want to be misunderstood,

53
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,650
stop bringing in the captives.

54
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:16,259
The Crown Prince is very ill.

55
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,000
He will take a trip to the hot springs.

56
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,930
Yes, Your Majesty.

57
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,949
Will you not...

58
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,089
put a floral shoe on my foot today?

59
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,529
I threw away all the floral shoes
because I was cross with you.

60
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,250
There is something...

61
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,389
I must finish up.

62
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:54,259
This is something I promised Yang Chun.

63
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:02,170
It will take a month, but I will be back.

64
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,329
I had these made at the forge back then.

65
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,800
Even though I thought you were dead,

66
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,800
I had them made...

67
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,699
and kept them with me.

68
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,310
I have...

69
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,579
placed a spell on this ring.

70
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,819
If you betray the lady
who gave you the ring,

71
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,649
you will get a stroke.

72
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
What?

73
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:08,899
So please do not worry about me.

74
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,699
I have survived those hardships
in Simyang.

75
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:15,839
If it is just a month,

76
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,040
I can wait for you with a smile.

77
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:50,769
(Onyang Temporary Palace)

78
00:08:57,009 --> 00:08:59,039
The preparations
for the captives are complete.

79
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,909
I will inform His Highness myself.

80
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,009
From now on,

81
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,750
do not ask His Highness
about the captives.

82
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:13,389
What do you mean?

83
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:18,960
His Highness said that
once he returned to Joseon...

84
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,070
I must see His Highness myself.

85
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,100
His Highness...

86
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,240
does not wish to see you.

87
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,519
Your Highness.

88
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,289
Have you forgotten your promise?

89
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:48,889
You said yourself...

90
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:54,730
that you would bring them back to Joseon.

91
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,240
They only persevered
because of your promise.

92
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,600
The promise...

93
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,509
that you have forgotten...

94
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:42,980
I still remember it.

95
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,480
Now...

96
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,960
I shall set out to uphold that promise.

97
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:56,759
I said, you may not.

98
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:09,039
If you go against me,

99
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:13,909
I will never see you again.

100
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,720
I was...

101
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:27,360
about to tell you the same.

102
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,730
From now on, I shall leave you for good.

103
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,580
Stop!

104
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:49,309
Lee Jang Hyun, stop there!

105
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:02,429
Do not rush.

106
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,230
Take it slow.

107
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,570
Watch it! Be careful.

108
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:17,980
Give me the baby.

109
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:40,730
If you wish,

110
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,399
I shall stay by your side.

111
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,539
In return,

112
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,080
guarantee me that the captives...

113
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,340
will be able to cross the river safely.

114
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,179
If you can do that,

115
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:58,980
after I finish picking up
the captives in Joseon,

116
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,419
I will come back to be by your side.

117
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:03,889
How...

118
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,860
can I trust you?

119
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:10,759
You have hundreds of captives
under your hostage.

120
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:13,259
If you break your promise,

121
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,269
I will really kill you this time.

122
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,679
I have sent the captives over.

123
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:31,379
Lee Jang Hyun.

124
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,389
It is now your turn to come.

125
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,490
They are here.

126
00:13:57,009 --> 00:13:58,580
Be careful. Hurry.

127
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,379
We have arrived.

128
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,509
Be careful.

129
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,820
Brother!

130
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,190
At last.

131
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,289
Goodness. Thank you.

132
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,500
I am here.

133
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:23,169
I am finally in my country.

134
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,570
Eol Soo.

135
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,000
Chul Soo!

136
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:30,210
We are finally here.

137
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,379
We are here.

138
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,019
Yang Chun.

139
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,320
Gosh. Jang Hyun.

140
00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:42,950
- Yang Chun.
- Yes.

141
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:47,519
Hey.

142
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:51,429
Hey, did I not tell you...

143
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:53,299
that I would...

144
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,929
bring you all back to Joseon?

145
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:59,399
- Thank you, Yang Chun!
- Thank you.

146
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,570
Thank you so much!

147
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,269
Goodness. Thank you.

148
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,539
Thank you, Yang Chun!

149
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,850
What is going on?

150
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:09,980
Oh, no!

151
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:12,379
Who are they?

152
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,389
Goodness.

153
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:23,129
Who are you?

154
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:27,700
Who are you?

155
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,169
Who are you guys?

156
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,870
Are you all bandits?

157
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,509
If riches are what you want,
we will give them to you.

158
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,179
Give me the baby.

159
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,850
Go back.

160
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,990
If you do not, you will all die.

161
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,720
- Stop with the nonsense!
- Go back!

162
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:53,259
You punks!

163
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,429
Do you know how hard it was
for us to come here?

164
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,730
Who are you to order us around?

165
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,200
Stop!

166
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,669
Kang Dal!

167
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,100
Strike them!

168
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,919
Step back.

169
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:25,259
Recross the river!

170
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:26,789
Let us go.

171
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,159
I cannot.

172
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,429
I will not go back!

173
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,299
- I cannot!
- Eol Soo.

174
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:32,830
You will die if you do not go!

175
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,870
I trusted you...

176
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,669
and His Highness.

177
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,809
But in the end, we were fooled!

178
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,639
No.

179
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,250
That is not true!

180
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,250
Let go!

181
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,820
- Let us go.
- Let go.

182
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,320
- Come on.
- I am not leaving!

183
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,419
Come on.

184
00:16:58,419 --> 00:16:59,460
We have to go.

185
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,090
- Hurry.
- Hurry.

186
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:10,230
- Hurry.
- Hurry.

187
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,950
In Ok.

188
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,019
Hurry up!

189
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:32,490
We have to go.

190
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:47,369
Baby.

191
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:48,869
Baby.

192
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,809
We have to go. Hurry.

193
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:56,049
Get up!

194
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:57,549
Get up!

195
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,990
Get up!

196
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,990
Come on.

197
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:11,960
Yang Chun!

198
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:34,519
Yang Chun!

199
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,950
Take him to safety!

200
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:38,420
At once!

201
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:13,819
Jang Hyun!

202
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,539
Yang Chun.

203
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,460
Lee Jang Hyun...

204
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,490
Where is he?

205
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:13,680
Jang Hyun.

206
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,180
Ningguchin.

207
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,490
Go in that direction.

208
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:28,130
I will prepare a horse for you.

209
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:45,839
What is wrong?

210
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:49,380
No.

211
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,279
- Deung No.
- Deung No.

212
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:52,380
- Stay with me.
- Hey!

213
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,480
Deung No.

214
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,950
No.

215
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,420
Goodness.

216
00:21:59,589 --> 00:22:01,289
If you are lying,

217
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:04,390
I will pull out your tongue.

218
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,960
Can you not believe me
after seeing all of this?

219
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
A bunch of men attacked us with spears,
telling us to leave.

220
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,069
We were able to cross the river.

221
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,109
But Jang Hyun...

222
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,009
I do not even know if he is alive or not.

223
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,119
He is dead?

224
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:29,190
If he were alive,
would he not be here by now?

225
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:32,190
I am sure...

226
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,230
No.

227
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:45,599
That cannot be true.

228
00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:05,759
Goodness.

229
00:23:06,589 --> 00:23:08,289
- I am so scared.
- Where are we going?

230
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,829
Whose orders did you follow
to commit treason?

231
00:23:44,829 --> 00:23:47,099
(Naesaok: a prison within the palace
controlled by eunuchs)

232
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:50,730
Did you perhaps act
upon the Crown Prince's orders?

233
00:23:58,109 --> 00:24:00,039
On the 25th of last month,
between the hours of 11 p.m. and 2 a.m.,

234
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,880
a scream was heard.

235
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,710
The servants of the Palace Supply Bureau
were armed...

236
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:07,180
and were seen rushing out
to the outer edges of the palace.

237
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:18,029
Master.

238
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,400
Yes.

239
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:26,400
The one who sent me an anonymous letter
has sent news again.

240
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,269
The servants
of the Palace Supply Bureau...

241
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:30,170
have dragged dozens of criminals
to their prison.

242
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,240
The servants of the Palace Supply Bureau?

243
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,180
What crimes did they commit?

244
00:24:34,609 --> 00:24:35,910
I am not sure,

245
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,279
but His Majesty suspects...

246
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,950
the captives, who have returned from
across the river, to be traitors.

247
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,660
How could His Majesty think
the captives are traitors...

248
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,710
Gather...

249
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,079
the scholars.

250
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,680
I will go to His Majesty.

251
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,920
If they are truly traitors,

252
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:20,789
they should be sent over
to the Department of Justice...

253
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:23,460
and punished under national law.

254
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,490
(Geumbu: Department of Justice,)

255
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,559
(where serious criminals were punished
under the King's orders)

256
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,359
If...

257
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:30,470
they are innocent,

258
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,140
I will be sure to get them out alive.

259
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,380
Goodness.

260
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,009
Who was it that incited you...

261
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,920
into plotting treason?

262
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,920
We do not know.

263
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,430
You say it.

264
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,200
Where are we?

265
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,380
Who is behind you?

266
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,400
Are you Gu Yang Chun?

267
00:26:35,829 --> 00:26:38,940
I know that your leader is Gu Yang Chun.

268
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,210
No, he is not.

269
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,240
This man is...

270
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,980
If you are not Gu Yang Chun,

271
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:53,450
then who is?

272
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,190
Is it you?

273
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,059
Please spare me!

274
00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:00,059
Is it you?

275
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:02,890
No, it is not me!

276
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:04,089
It is me.

277
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:08,130
What?

278
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:11,599
I am Gu Yang Chun.

279
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:16,470
So you should speak to me.

280
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:24,880
This man is the one...

281
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,180
who helped us run away...

282
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,420
and to cross the river.

283
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:40,130
He is that man.

284
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,599
Leave this man here
and drag the rest of them out.

285
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,740
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

286
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,009
Come on!

287
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,279
- Please have mercy!
- Please spare us!

288
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,410
Let us live.

289
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,470
Yang Chun.

290
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,400
Are you awake?

291
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,400
Yang Chun.

292
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:29,279
How is everyone doing?

293
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,000
You betrayed us, right?

294
00:29:33,109 --> 00:29:34,809
You sold us off, right?

295
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:38,750
To those jerks.

296
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,150
You plotted with them,

297
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,420
and sold us...

298
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,430
My Byung Hee...

299
00:29:50,829 --> 00:29:51,900
Bring her back.

300
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,210
Byung Hee...

301
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,039
Bring Byung Hee back to life!

302
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:07,609
My daughter, Byung Hee!

303
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,809
Bring her back!

304
00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:13,049
- Bring Byung Hee back to life!
- In Ok.

305
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:15,019
- Bring her back!
- In Ok.

306
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:17,150
My daughter, Byung Hee.

307
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,089
My poor Byung Hee.

308
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:22,289
Bring her back!

309
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:25,400
Your Highness.

310
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,430
Your Highness, do you remember me?

311
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:34,099
They killed the captives who had
come from the border regions,

312
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:37,509
and they took the survivors away?

313
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,480
Where to?

314
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,910
Where did they take them to?

315
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,279
I do not know.

316
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:50,250
I do not know where Lee Jang Hyun
has gone, Your Highness.

317
00:30:54,289 --> 00:30:55,359
Please save him.

318
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,960
Please save Lee Jang Hyun.

319
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:03,630
Father...

320
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:09,069
Father!

321
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:24,220
Let us go to the Palace.

322
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:27,660
Your Highness.

323
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,490
Your Highness.

324
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,529
Your Highness.

325
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,099
Those who are targeting you...

326
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:38,640
are only waiting for you
to lose your footing.

327
00:31:40,269 --> 00:31:41,369
So, Your Highness.

328
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,809
Please do not anger His Majesty.

329
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:51,750
Please save yourself...

330
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:54,950
and your firstborn son, Your Highness.

331
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,099
Let us go.

332
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,619
I will go with His Highness.

333
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:30,650
Get ready.

334
00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:32,359
Yes, Your Highness.

335
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:36,630
What was the reason
that you raised a private army?

336
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:43,069
Those men...

337
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,470
are not a private army.

338
00:32:48,339 --> 00:32:49,369
They are captives.

339
00:32:51,309 --> 00:32:52,410
I merely...

340
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,349
tried to bring the captives
back to Joseon.

341
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,380
Who put you up to it?

342
00:33:06,289 --> 00:33:07,819
No one made me.

343
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:11,390
It was...

344
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:15,430
just my own plan to bring back...

345
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,170
the released captives.

346
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,750
Jong Jong...

347
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,890
loves me.

348
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,119
She loves me not.

349
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,430
She loves me.

350
00:33:54,269 --> 00:33:56,740
Jang Hyun... This is insane.

351
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:52,699
My child...

352
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,170
Let go.

353
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,510
Let me go!

354
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,440
Let go!

355
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:10,849
Stop it.

356
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:17,789
What is this?

357
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:23,530
Did you and Interpreter Lee...

358
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:30,500
This is great.

359
00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:32,199
I am glad for you.

360
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,269
I knew this day would come.

361
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:40,579
Why are you crying, Madam Bang Doo?

362
00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:42,510
Because I am happy, of course.

363
00:35:43,179 --> 00:35:45,820
You should have patched things up with him
long ago, then.

364
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,880
All that heartache...

365
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,059
He said he had some business in Simyang.

366
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:57,260
Once he returns,

367
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,429
he wants to stay with me.

368
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:21,780
What?

369
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:24,210
The scholars are heading over here?

370
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,949
Who is it?

371
00:37:27,449 --> 00:37:28,989
Who led them here?

372
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:30,650
Is it Kim Jib?

373
00:37:30,989 --> 00:37:32,150
Or Jang Chul?

374
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,719
Or is it Kim Sang Heon?

375
00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:37,860
No.

376
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,960
Did the Crown Prince instigate them?

377
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,570
It is Jang Chul.

378
00:38:08,889 --> 00:38:10,389
You wait outside.

379
00:38:11,429 --> 00:38:12,800
Please bring me along.

380
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,170
Why is His Highness in a rush
to see His Majesty?

381
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:21,269
By any chance,

382
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,039
is His Majesty involved
in Jang Hyun's arrest?

383
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,110
I said I would find out.

384
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:32,250
Just wait outside the palace.

385
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:52,329
The scholars are being defiant...

386
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:57,110
because there is a cursed object
hidden in the palace.

387
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,639
Your Highness.

388
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,280
Your Highness!

389
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:14,019
Lady Cho, please excuse us.

390
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,219
Prince So Hyun.

391
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:17,090
You are being rude.

392
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,130
Right now!

393
00:39:56,369 --> 00:39:57,469
What...

394
00:39:59,869 --> 00:40:01,300
did you do with the captives?

395
00:40:02,369 --> 00:40:05,210
Are you showing your true colors at last?

396
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,710
Your Majesty.

397
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,639
Did you think I would not find out...

398
00:40:08,909 --> 00:40:12,179
about the soldiers you brought in
from the Qing?

399
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,380
What soldiers?

400
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,619
Then tell me.

401
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,349
What were they, if not soldiers?

402
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:21,460
There were weapons in their belongings.

403
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,159
They killed the servants
at the Palace Supply Bureau.

404
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:25,929
Your Majesty.

405
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:28,530
They are merely captives.

406
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:30,130
They are our people.

407
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:32,000
What?

408
00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:33,469
Our people?

409
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:36,440
Then...

410
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:38,940
did you rush all the way here,

411
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,710
drenched by the morning dew...

412
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:45,550
despite your frail body
just for the sake of the people?

413
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:49,820
Of course not.

414
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:55,119
Are they the ones
who will help you rise to the throne?

415
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:58,289
Is that why you are so protective of them?

416
00:41:01,929 --> 00:41:03,130
Your Majesty.

417
00:41:03,329 --> 00:41:06,539
Even if the world turns its back on me,

418
00:41:07,469 --> 00:41:10,670
I had believed
that you at least would protect me.

419
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:14,179
It turned out to be no one but my son...

420
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,010
who shall stab me in the back.

421
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,650
Are they waiting outside the gates...

422
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,960
for your orders?

423
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,489
Are they holding swords and iron clubs...

424
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:32,030
to target me?

425
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,650
Your Majesty.

426
00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:03,559
They were farmers and workers
who slogged it out in Simyang.

427
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:10,170
Singing Joseon songs on Simyang land,

428
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:14,969
they are captives who missed Joseon.

429
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:21,639
Risking their lives to escape,

430
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,780
they are Your Majesty's people.

431
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,960
How can you...

432
00:42:35,289 --> 00:42:37,690
doubt that
they have treacherous intentions?

433
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,670
Please see what I saw.

434
00:43:24,409 --> 00:43:27,579
The people of this country
shaped me into a better person.

435
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:30,980
I...

436
00:43:32,949 --> 00:43:36,019
I smelled their sweat...

437
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:40,489
and witnessed the tears
falling down their faces.

438
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,590
The scene was sweeter
than any delicacy in the world...

439
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:51,269
and more beautiful
than any silk out there.

440
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,369
You have to see it
with your own eyes as well, Your Majesty.

441
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:00,280
If you do,

442
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:03,550
you will understand me.

443
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:06,920
And you will want to save them.

444
00:44:08,349 --> 00:44:09,389
I do not want to hear it!

445
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,389
What nonsense.

446
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:21,230
I am going to handle this matter
in secret...

447
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:24,429
for I hate to be harsh,

448
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,440
so you should be grateful.

449
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:05,809
Your Highness!

450
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,380
Things are happening quickly,
so we must hurry.

451
00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:16,849
Have you not heard back from the girl
who makes knives?

452
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,960
It cannot be anyone else.

453
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:22,590
It must be her. Do you understand?

454
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:24,690
Yes, Your Majesty.

455
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:40,639
I am a sinner...

456
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,809
for I was not able to protect the people
of my country from the intruders.

457
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:50,349
So I tried not to present myself
to the world for I was ashamed.

458
00:45:51,019 --> 00:45:52,019
However,

459
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:56,019
I will no longer just sit in my room
and utter bitter criticisms.

460
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:59,090
That is not a way to protect my country.

461
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:01,500
It is not a way to protect the people.

462
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:05,070
Even if...

463
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,570
His Majesty is to rebuke me...

464
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:11,039
and the people are to resent me,

465
00:46:11,309 --> 00:46:13,809
I will continue to do...

466
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,210
what I must for this country...

467
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,519
and the people.

468
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:29,219
Will you join me?

469
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,230
Yes, Master!

470
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,400
We will follow you.

471
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:35,559
- We will join you, Master!
- We will join you, Master!

472
00:46:57,590 --> 00:46:59,119
A collective appeal?

473
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,659
What is it that they want?

474
00:47:04,889 --> 00:47:06,500
They are asking
for the criminals in prison...

475
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,730
to be handed over
to the Department of Justice.

476
00:47:10,969 --> 00:47:12,230
My gosh!

477
00:47:16,309 --> 00:47:17,309
Darn it.

478
00:47:22,809 --> 00:47:24,079
Bring Jang Chul to me.

479
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:30,619
As for the criminals in prison...

480
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,250
This man...

481
00:48:01,019 --> 00:48:02,650
Smash his head and kill him.

482
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:05,619
Yes, sir.

483
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,489
You know,

484
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:12,719
I will make...

485
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:16,289
an embroidered pillowcase for Lord Lee.

486
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,760
I thought you said you would not
have anything to do with a misogamist.

487
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:24,099
That is just the way of life.

488
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,599
You also said
you would rather be a bhikkhuni...

489
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:28,940
than marry Bak Dae.

490
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,349
It is hard taking care of my dad...

491
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,880
with the money I send you, right?

492
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,190
I am working hard to earn money,

493
00:49:45,989 --> 00:49:47,889
so sooner or later, I will take him...

494
00:49:47,889 --> 00:49:49,730
No, I will not allow that.

495
00:49:50,389 --> 00:49:53,030
He is also like a father
to me and my lord.

496
00:49:56,599 --> 00:49:58,269
When Interpreter Lee returns,

497
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,739
we can all live happily together.

498
00:50:01,869 --> 00:50:03,969
That is all we should think about, okay?

499
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,539
Is anyone home?

500
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:13,119
Her Majesty wants to see you.

501
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:16,219
Why do you keep coming back?

502
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:17,949
I cannot do what you asked.

503
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,559
She will give you three times
the original amount.

504
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:22,960
Then answer me.

505
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:26,429
Why are you privately asking me
to prepare something...

506
00:50:27,059 --> 00:50:28,730
that will be sent to the Queen's Palace?

507
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:32,300
I cannot do something you ask
when I do not know what you are plotting.

508
00:50:33,969 --> 00:50:36,610
Once Prince Sung Sun accedes
to the throne, you will...

509
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:38,710
(Prince Sung Sun:
the son of Injo and Lady Cho)

510
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:40,340
The Crown Prince has returned.

511
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,280
How will Prince Sung Sun
accede to the throne?

512
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:45,309
You do not know what is going on.

513
00:50:47,179 --> 00:50:48,679
It is over for the Crown Prince.

514
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:51,820
The Crown Prince and the people
he conspired with in Simyang...

515
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:53,260
have all been caught.

516
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:04,329
What do you mean by that?

517
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:06,699
Then...

518
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,239
are you saying the people
who were loyal to the Crown Prince...

519
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:12,369
have been caught?

520
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:20,480
My husband actually told me something.

521
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:23,079
He told me...

522
00:51:23,849 --> 00:51:26,460
that a lot of people
are being dragged to prison...

523
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,360
and tormented to death these days.

524
00:51:34,929 --> 00:51:35,960
I like this one.

525
00:51:41,269 --> 00:51:42,300
You engraved it nicely.

526
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:45,809
"Admire the queen's residence
with high praise."

527
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,440
Do you like it?

528
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,110
By the way,

529
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,780
is it certain
that the group from Simyang...

530
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:56,949
has all been captured?

531
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:00,920
I must also have someone to rely on...

532
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:04,559
I told you to watch your mouth.

533
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:10,400
I could become the future king's mother.

534
00:52:12,369 --> 00:52:13,800
So, from now on,

535
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:16,170
just do what I tell you to
without a hitch.

536
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:23,650
Hurry up.

537
00:52:24,679 --> 00:52:25,710
Okay.

538
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:36,630
Is something going on in the palace?

539
00:52:38,329 --> 00:52:40,929
You will not live long
with that curiosity of yours.

540
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:43,730
- Are you finished?
- Yes.

541
00:52:46,739 --> 00:52:47,969
I am finished.

542
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,349
Goodness, I can smell it from here.

543
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,650
I know, right?

544
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:02,250
They always seem to be
interrogating people...

545
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:03,389
at the Palace Supply Bureau.

546
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:04,920
Goodness.

547
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:08,320
You know about what is happening
at the Palace Supply Bureau?

548
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:11,590
Plenty of people know about it.

549
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:16,400
I hope this mess is over with soon.

550
00:53:18,199 --> 00:53:19,300
Then get going.

551
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:34,739
Your Majesty.

552
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:39,610
I have waited so long
to meet you in person.

553
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:41,119
I finally get to meet you.

554
00:54:41,179 --> 00:54:45,619
I, your humble servant, have finally come
to greet you, Your Majesty.

555
00:54:45,889 --> 00:54:49,659
Then why is it that you are bothering me
because of a trivial matter?

556
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:51,829
Then why do you...

557
00:54:51,829 --> 00:54:55,800
kill your people over
a trivial matter, Your Majesty?

558
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,099
Since it is a trivial matter,

559
00:54:58,099 --> 00:54:59,570
you are torturing and interrogating them
in the Palace Supply Bureau,

560
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:01,000
are you not?

561
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,809
If they were truly traitors,

562
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:08,679
please send them to the Department
of Justice and reveal their crimes.

563
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:12,010
There is a reason why I cannot send them
to the Department of Justice.

564
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,750
So you should take the scholars
and go home.

565
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:17,820
If you do not go back this instant,

566
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:20,219
I will send the palace guards
to send them away.

567
00:55:20,219 --> 00:55:21,320
(Geumgun: palace guards
in charge of guarding the king)

568
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,690
Do you wish your pupils to get hurt?

569
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,800
If my pupils get hurt,

570
00:55:28,099 --> 00:55:31,900
the scholars all across the nation
will rise up in revolt.

571
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:35,369
Have you forgotten how Gwanghae lost
the support of the scholars...

572
00:55:35,369 --> 00:55:39,139
and lost everything else afterwards?

573
00:55:40,309 --> 00:55:41,440
Your Majesty.

574
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:45,579
You kept Joseon safe
from the grasp of Gwanghae.

575
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:47,449
Joseon is a nation where the people...

576
00:55:47,449 --> 00:55:50,349
serve the king
with allegiance and fidelity...

577
00:55:50,619 --> 00:55:52,719
and a nation where the king,
who is served,

578
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:56,119
keeps his loyalty to his people.

579
00:55:56,289 --> 00:55:58,030
So, how could you...

580
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:00,300
betray that loyalty...

581
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,760
by covertly killing people?

582
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:05,900
How could you anger the skies?

583
00:56:06,469 --> 00:56:08,769
Until you move...

584
00:56:08,769 --> 00:56:10,869
those who are being kept
in the Palace Supply Bureau...

585
00:56:10,869 --> 00:56:13,010
to the Department of Justice,

586
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:15,739
I refuse...

587
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:18,909
to move an inch from this very spot.

588
00:56:19,949 --> 00:56:21,619
Have this man taken away!

589
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:22,949
Your Majesty.

590
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:25,820
Please move those who are being kept
in the Palace Supply Bureau...

591
00:56:26,019 --> 00:56:28,289
to the Department of Justice.

592
00:56:28,989 --> 00:56:30,260
Your Majesty.

593
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:33,659
Please do not betray your loyalty!

594
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:38,000
- Please do not anger the skies!
- Why, that little...

595
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,570
Your Majesty!

596
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:43,139
Please move those who are being kept
in the Palace Supply Bureau...

597
00:56:43,139 --> 00:56:45,469
- to the Department of Justice.
- What do you think you are doing?

598
00:56:45,469 --> 00:56:46,469
Let go of him!

599
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:47,909
- Let go of him!
- Let go of him!

600
00:56:47,909 --> 00:56:51,550
You must not betray your loyalty!

601
00:56:51,579 --> 00:56:52,610
Let go of him!

602
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:53,679
- Your Majesty!
- Let go of him!

603
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:57,090
Please do not anger the skies!

604
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,190
Your Majesty!

605
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:02,820
Please move those who are being kept
in the Palace Supply Bureau...

606
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:05,460
to the Department of Justice.

607
00:57:06,329 --> 00:57:10,130
Please do not betray your loyalty,
Your Majesty!

608
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,730
Your Majesty!

609
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:15,539
Please move those who are being kept
in the Palace Supply Bureau...

610
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,340
to the Department of Justice!

611
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:22,809
Please do not betray your loyalty!

612
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:40,699
Do not cry.

613
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:44,769
Your sister...

614
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:47,570
did that for you.

615
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,670
Hey, there. I am to wait here?

616
00:58:55,239 --> 00:58:56,769
We have orders to empty
the Palace Supply Bureau.

617
00:58:57,809 --> 00:58:59,139
It must be because of the scholars.

618
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:27,739
My lord.

619
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:31,940
My lord.

620
00:59:32,539 --> 00:59:33,710
My lord.

621
01:00:37,909 --> 01:00:41,579
Please do not betray your loyalty,
Your Majesty!

622
01:00:44,949 --> 01:00:47,050
Your Majesty!

623
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:52,920
Please move those who are being kept
in the Palace Supply Bureau...

624
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:56,159
to the Department of Justice!

625
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,590
- Move them to the Department of Justice!
- Move them to the Department of Justice!

626
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:02,630
Please move those who are being kept
in the Palace Supply Bureau...

627
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:05,000
to the Department of Justice!

628
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:40,599
My lord.

629
01:01:54,519 --> 01:01:55,550
My lord.

630
01:01:56,119 --> 01:01:57,690
Are you awake?

631
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:19,010
(My Dearest)

632
01:03:07,489 --> 01:03:09,460
I must bring Lord Lee elsewhere.

633
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:11,090
His corpse disappeared.

634
01:03:11,289 --> 01:03:12,289
My lord.

635
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:13,789
My lord!

636
01:03:14,429 --> 01:03:17,400
The Crown Princess is involved
in a shameful affair.

637
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,570
Treason?

638
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:19,900
That is not true.

639
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:21,440
His Highness is...

640
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,440
Your Highness.

641
01:03:22,869 --> 01:03:23,940
In Joseon,

642
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:25,869
the Crown Prince's people
are all being purged.

643
01:03:25,869 --> 01:03:27,070
Is that true?

644
01:03:28,579 --> 01:03:29,579
My lord.

645
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:33,809
This moment is my happiest one with you.

646
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:37,550
Even if I die,
I will never leave your side again.
