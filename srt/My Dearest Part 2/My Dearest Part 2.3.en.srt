1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,410
(This drama is a work of fiction
created based on historical facts.)

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,080
(Most of the details and depictions
of the characters are fictional.)

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:05,780
Ttaeng Ttaeng.

4
00:00:08,349 --> 00:00:09,650
My goodness.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,150
You sure are strong.

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,149
Why are you crying?

7
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:17,589
Why are you crying?

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,789
My goodness.

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,660
Gosh.

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,059
Are you hungry?

11
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,300
Are you full?

12
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:28,800
Are you sleepy?

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,100
My gosh.

14
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,240
Ttaeng Ttaeng, stop crying.

15
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,509
A boy should not cry so much.

16
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:39,679
The porridge is very savory.

17
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,390
There is no need.

18
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:55,729
I just had some breastmilk left.

19
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,399
Thank you
for getting the baby to stop crying,

20
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:03,000
but I cannot have him suckle
on the same breast...

21
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,069
as the child of the enemy
who killed his parents.

22
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,069
What do you mean by that?

23
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:24,319
Baby!

24
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,629
- Come on!
- My baby!

25
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,359
I mean, the foreign intruders
are Ttaeng Ttaeng's enemies.

26
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,769
Your child's father is a foreign intruder,
is he not?

27
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:40,170
Never let Ttaeng Ttaeng suckle
on your breast again.

28
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,349
My baby...

29
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:01,689
is not the child of a foreign intruder.

30
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,530
It is smallpox!

31
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,830
It is the plague!

32
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,069
The plague!

33
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:14,039
Smallpox!

34
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,409
- It is smallpox!
- Smallpox!

35
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,840
It is the plague!

36
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,180
Smallpox!

37
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,430
Get them!

38
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:41,800
Madam, come on out!

39
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:19,169
Have you been well?

40
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:27,849
It has been a while since we last met.

41
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,689
How dare you get in my way?

42
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,529
I apologize.

43
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:52,930
I am still inept with the bow.

44
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:57,300
What is your identity?

45
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:00,410
Who knows?

46
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:05,139
Why should I reveal that
to someone who hides behind a mask?

47
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:18,089
See you again.

48
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,529
I think I will be sad...

49
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,430
if I do not see you the next time.

50
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:37,810
Jong Jong!

51
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:58,129
Jong Jong, come over here!

52
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,610
Please go ahead, madam.

53
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:17,649
Come with us!

54
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,949
I will not make it far in this state.

55
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,759
Thank you so much...

56
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,990
for saving my grandson.

57
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,899
Please leave already!

58
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:01,560
Hurry up!

59
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:08,930
If we get caught,

60
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,139
our bodies will be soiled.

61
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,939
It will be better if I just...

62
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,810
Oh, no!

63
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:27,990
Please do not!

64
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:39,860
What are you doing?

65
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,939
If I return as a soiled woman,

66
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,870
it would be a sin against my parents.

67
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,610
It is our will to live.

68
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,170
Why should our parents matter?

69
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,379
Jong Jong.

70
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,439
Back at Ganghwa Island,

71
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,709
everyone jumped but we lived.

72
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,920
And I was happy to be alive.

73
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,850
But...

74
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:03,019
if the intruders catch us this time...

75
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,290
That will not happen.

76
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,060
I will protect you.

77
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:11,160
Hold my hand.

78
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,829
Come on.

79
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:25,910
Hold my hand.

80
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,830
You cannot escape now.

81
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,629
Die.

82
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,059
Die!

83
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,570
You Joseon scum.

84
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,100
Go and die. Die!

85
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,409
Die.

86
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:02,580
You filthy thing.

87
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,179
Madam!

88
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,549
Madam!

89
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,789
Drag her away!

90
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,659
- Madam!
- Jong Jong!

91
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:14,029
- Madam!
- Let her go!

92
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:15,330
Where are you taking her?

93
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,529
Jong Jong!

94
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,029
Jong Jong!

95
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,669
Not my Jong Jong!

96
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:22,669
Jong Jong!

97
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,570
My Jong Jong!

98
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,909
Anyone there?

99
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:29,240
Oh, yes.

100
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,740
Do you have any rooms?

101
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,039
Of course.

102
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,909
- Please come this way.
- All right.

103
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:36,149
(Tavern)

104
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,549
Let us go in.

105
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:55,629
Are you heading to Simyang?

106
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,000
To bail captives?

107
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,169
- How did you...
- It is obvious.

108
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,169
Everyone who heads to Simyang
to bail captives...

109
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,179
will take this road.

110
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,879
So who are you bailing?

111
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,879
Your parents? Or your children?

112
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:20,490
Give it back.

113
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:24,129
What an incredible beauty.

114
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,059
Is she your wife?

115
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,669
- Why are you laughing?
- Do I have to spell it out?

116
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:37,809
A respectable madam
was taken as a captive.

117
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,950
Did you check the list
of captives already?

118
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,179
(List of captives:
list of captives in Simyang)

119
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:43,279
I...

120
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,149
She might be okay if she was
sold to the Crown Prince's quarters.

121
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:50,350
But if she was dragged
to the slave market,

122
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,820
her body would have been soiled
by other men.

123
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,659
Do you still want her back?

124
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,590
- What did you say?
- Wait.

125
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,830
Please spare me.

126
00:10:58,129 --> 00:10:59,230
My lord!

127
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,169
Please restrain yourself.

128
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:48,779
You fools.

129
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:50,250
Please spare us!

130
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,490
I sold all my farmland to bail my son...

131
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,389
and headed to Simyang with 50 nyang.

132
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:00,990
However, they demanded
100 nyang this time.

133
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:06,100
Other captives were released
when their rich families paid 100 nyang.

134
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:10,600
So they refused to sell my son to me
for less than 100 nyang.

135
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,070
Even if I sell my soul,

136
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,110
I have no way of getting that much money.

137
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:21,710
Still, how could you steal
the money meant for my wife?

138
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:23,009
My lord.

139
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:27,080
Your wife must have
lost her chastity already.

140
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,950
Why do you still want her back?

141
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,220
You can...

142
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:32,690
always find another wife,

143
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:35,860
but how can I replace
my own flesh and blood?

144
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,360
Shut it.

145
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:39,129
Please save my son.

146
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:42,230
I will make sure to repay you
if you lend me money.

147
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,240
At this rate, my son will die of sickness.

148
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,039
Please, my lord.

149
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,750
The boat will arrive soon.

150
00:12:58,049 --> 00:12:59,379
Why is he not back yet?

151
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:05,490
My lord!

152
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,190
My lord.

153
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,029
Did you get back our belongings?

154
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:15,529
Your wife must have
lost her chastity already.

155
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,370
Why do you still want her back?

156
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,279
My lord!

157
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,009
Goodness me.

158
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,409
My lord!

159
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,149
There you are.

160
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,480
My lady!

161
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,549
Lord Yoo is here.

162
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:37,019
Father, why did you leave again?

163
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,190
Let us go.

164
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,389
Let us go.

165
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,860
Father,

166
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:49,730
did the intruders
really take away Gil Chae this time?

167
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,669
Young Master,

168
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,500
this time,

169
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:57,269
the intruders really took Madam away.

170
00:13:58,679 --> 00:13:59,710
Sorry.

171
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:03,549
The intruders took her away.

172
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:05,620
I knew something would happen.

173
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,019
She loved leaving the house.

174
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,690
Let us go.

175
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:16,159
Was she really abducted by the intruders?

176
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,659
Yes, she was.

177
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,029
Officer Gu sold his products
at a cheap price...

178
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,669
to earn enough for the ransom.

179
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,669
Goodness. Did I not tell you?

180
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:30,870
If a woman goes around
pushing herself forward,

181
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,809
she is bound to get into trouble.

182
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:34,710
Hey, watch your mouth.

183
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,980
Why do I need to watch my mouth?

184
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,019
Gosh.

185
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,990
Do not dare...

186
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,289
talk about our Madam
with your dirty mouth.

187
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,559
What?

188
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:49,559
You caused great harm...

189
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:51,100
to our forge...

190
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,200
by reporting one of the workers
as a captive!

191
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:57,470
We cannot let you get away with that!

192
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,299
What are you saying?

193
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,139
- Goodness.
- Goodness.

194
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,210
Hey! Goodness!

195
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,610
You should have been more careful.

196
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,080
Gosh!

197
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:09,580
Goodness!

198
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,620
I pray to the deities.

199
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,889
Please help Gil Chae return safely.

200
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,559
Please watch over...

201
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:20,919
Officer Gu who left
to bring Gil Chae back.

202
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,059
Gil Chae and Jong Jong.

203
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:27,200
Please watch over them
so they may return safe and sound.

204
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:30,269
I pray to the deities.

205
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:34,940
Please help Gil Chae return safely.

206
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:43,110
(Simyang, Gil Chae, Officer Gu Won Moo)

207
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,450
I have confirmed...

208
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,679
that Officer Gu's wife
has been dragged away by the Qing.

209
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:49,950
The officials need to get involved.

210
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,120
Officer Gu rushed to Simyang,

211
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,559
but it is uncertain if he will be able
to return with his wife.

212
00:15:56,259 --> 00:15:58,399
- The royal court must be informed...
- Was this really...

213
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,830
written with Lady Yoo's blood?

214
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,970
- Your Honor.
- What?

215
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,370
Inform the royal court?

216
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,870
Look.

217
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:11,110
After telling the officials
that the Qing wrongly took someone away,

218
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,110
what are you going to do
if it is revealed that she in fact...

219
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,350
was a runaway captive?

220
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:18,649
If things go sideways, the Qing will not
let me live to see another day.

221
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:21,820
If that happens,
will you be able to protect me?

222
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,490
Gosh.

223
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:43,039
You remember the man...

224
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:45,210
who helped you from being exiled, right?

225
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,080
I heard he also helped...

226
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,580
a few captives escape recently.

227
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,879
What do you think...

228
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,190
of reaching out to him for help
regarding Gil Chae?

229
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,259
I am not sure.

230
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,460
Are you aware that
during the reign of the previous king,

231
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,429
his family was acknowledged
as the greatest contributor?

232
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,799
Then you probably do not know...

233
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,829
how they accomplished that either.

234
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:12,500
On top of that, it is said...

235
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,910
that he makes a lot of meddling appeals
in regard to His Majesty's matters.

236
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,980
It is impossible to know...

237
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,740
if he is a loyal subject...

238
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,210
or a person who is thirsty for honor.

239
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,690
Where should we go to eat?

240
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,420
We can go to the place we went last time.

241
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,589
Let us do that.

242
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:35,589
- Can I join?
- Of course.

243
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:36,759
Thank you.

244
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:39,099
May I ask a question?

245
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,029
Can you inform Master Jang...

246
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:44,299
that a man named Nam Yeon Jun
whom he helped before,

247
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:45,369
is here to pay his respects?

248
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:47,910
"Nam Yeon Jun?"

249
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,339
Are you the Nam Yeon Jun
who was imprisoned...

250
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:51,980
for protecting his integrity?

251
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:58,920
I finally get to see your face.

252
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:01,589
My apologies.

253
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,819
I took too long to pay my respects
after receiving your help.

254
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:07,259
No.

255
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:10,990
It was not me who showed you mercy,
it was His Majesty.

256
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:13,099
By the way,

257
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:16,299
is there a reason you came to visit me?

258
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:19,839
To be honest,

259
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,769
the friend of my wife,
who greeted you before,

260
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:27,309
has been dragged away to the Qing
after being wrongly accused as a captive.

261
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:30,509
The papers and inkstones are...

262
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:33,519
a token of my feelings for my father.

263
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,319
Please accept them.

264
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,660
She was a bright woman.

265
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,029
How did that happen?

266
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:50,599
Our school has made appeals...

267
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:53,740
to help some people escape.

268
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,410
But they were people
who were dragged away...

269
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,740
while protecting the fortress
in Year Byungja.

270
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:01,349
In this case,

271
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:04,819
where she has been falsely accused
as a runaway captive,

272
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:09,650
as there is no way of finding evidence
to prove her innocence,

273
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,619
I also have no way to help.

274
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:14,589
But...

275
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:16,730
We cannot just help anyone...

276
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:20,960
because of personal connections.

277
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,500
I have no justification.

278
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,109
It is disconcerting
that we were not able to help.

279
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,970
That is not true.

280
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:33,009
I am grateful that you let me meet him.

281
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,410
By any chance,

282
00:19:37,579 --> 00:19:39,380
are you not interested in joining us?

283
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,750
If you, who are known for your loyalty,
are to join us,

284
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:45,319
it would be of great help.

285
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,789
I will not be of big help.

286
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:53,230
The country is coming apart.
Are you just going to watch?

287
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,970
Even if you do not
hold a position in office,

288
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:59,099
you should help the country get back up
as a scholar.

289
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:03,769
Our master has that power.

290
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,480
Our master appealed to His Majesty...

291
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,980
to send rice to Pyeongan Island.

292
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,819
His appeal of sending medical supplies...

293
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:14,079
to each province
will also take effect soon.

294
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:18,289
Here,

295
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:21,690
there are a lot of things
for a person like you to do.

296
00:20:25,329 --> 00:20:28,769
Hey, look at its teeth.

297
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:31,769
It is getting up now.

298
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:34,470
As per your request,
we tried to bring 25 cows,

299
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:37,740
but the cows that were too skinny
and sick were sent back.

300
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,809
So there are only 23 cows.

301
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,950
You brought nice and healthy cows.

302
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,779
Good work.

303
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:59,259
Thanks to you,
I was able to avoid going to Mongolia.

304
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,529
- Thank you.
- Me too.

305
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,099
If you are that grateful, can you give me
100 copies of white paper?

306
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,470
How did you know
I secretly brought in white paper?

307
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,910
You cannot pull the wool
over Interpreter Lee's eyes.

308
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,809
But we cannot give it to you right away.

309
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:17,180
They need to be used
for releasing captives.

310
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,720
Are you talking about Lady Yoo?

311
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,779
Yes.

312
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,849
I do not know when she got dragged away,

313
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:23,690
but she became a slave of Prince Yoon.

314
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:26,660
What...

315
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,859
do you mean by that?

316
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:30,859
Well...

317
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,400
was it a month ago?

318
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,369
I visited Prince Yoon's residence,

319
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:39,339
but a maidservant told me
that Lady Yoo from Joseon was there.

320
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,240
But I could not hear clearly
who she wanted me to relay the message to,

321
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,309
so I asked any of the interpreters
if they knew Lady Yoo,

322
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:49,279
and he stepped up.

323
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,849
She is the daughter of the person
who raised me like his own child.

324
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,660
I should do my best to help her.

325
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:04,259
Goodness.

326
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,730
I see.

327
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:11,200
Here comes the princess!

328
00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:17,109
Here comes the princess!

329
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,880
Here comes the princess!

330
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,589
Here comes the princess!

331
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:48,569
Lift your head up.

332
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,650
Since you have seen my face,

333
00:23:00,819 --> 00:23:02,450
can you tell me who you are now?

334
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,200
Then...

335
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:17,700
the person who has been catching captives
with her face covered...

336
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,970
Yes.

337
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,470
It is me.

338
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,069
Now tell me.

339
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,910
What did you do
after catching the captives?

340
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:31,680
General Yong Gol Dae ordered me
to catch the runaway captives.

341
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,619
I only followed the orders of the general.

342
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,819
This has become a bother.

343
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:39,960
"A bother?"

344
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,900
Should I...

345
00:23:48,569 --> 00:23:50,029
really make things bothersome for you?

346
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,410
Why? Are you surprised?

347
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:04,579
I know the Joseon language
and its people...

348
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:06,220
very well.

349
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:11,250
If you lie to me one more time,

350
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:14,930
I will cut out your tongue.

351
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,930
So, tell me.

352
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,670
What did you do after taking the captives?

353
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:24,869
Then, why not ask General Yong Gol Dae...

354
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,069
where he got the silver that
he has been pocketing in private...

355
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:31,980
in person?

356
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,420
I have heard of
a snake-like Joseon interpreter...

357
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,890
who has been helping
the imperial family gain wealth.

358
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,690
That must be you.

359
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:55,130
I hear one can acquire anything
one might need in the palace...

360
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:57,500
if one goes through you.

361
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:04,609
Do you have something you need?

362
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,309
There is one thing.

363
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:16,990
Give me...

364
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:18,960
your time.

365
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,769
Please tell me.

366
00:25:33,069 --> 00:25:35,039
Where did you take Jong Jong?

367
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:36,640
Where?

368
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:38,710
My dear Jong Jong...

369
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,279
Where did you take Jong Jong?

370
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,000
I am half of Joseon heritage as well.

371
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,940
I do not like
being cruel to Joseon people.

372
00:26:07,339 --> 00:26:08,970
But you cannot be helped, you wench.

373
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,440
Your fate depends on how you act now.

374
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,279
Lady Yoo...

375
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:25,859
(Simgwan: the Crown Prince's quarters
in Simyang Palace)

376
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,230
Lady Yoo is not on the list of captives...

377
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,230
that have been returned by the Qing.

378
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,599
I am sure she has been dragged here
by people from Qing.

379
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:35,630
It took me a whole month to get here.

380
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,869
Please check once more.

381
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:39,170
Three of the captives who were caught
while trying to run away...

382
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,440
had their heels cut off.

383
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,869
The others have
all been returned to their masters.

384
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,079
Those masters
who want their slaves returned...

385
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:50,279
submit a list
to the Crown Prince's quarters.

386
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,549
But if they do not,

387
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:55,049
they do not even leave a list.

388
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:58,460
We cannot do anything about it.

389
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,460
Try going to the slave market.

390
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,259
I heard that a Joseon woman was
recently cast out to the slave market.

391
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,369
Apparently, she was exquisitely beautiful,

392
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:13,339
but she inflicted a wound
on her own forehead.

393
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,619
She might be okay if she was
sold to the Crown Prince's quarters.

394
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:34,019
But if she was dragged
to the slave market,

395
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,259
her body would have been soiled
by other men.

396
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,779
Follow me!

397
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,309
Move it!

398
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:55,579
Get up!

399
00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:01,849
Walk faster!

400
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,490
Walk straight!

401
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,390
Move faster!

402
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,170
Go on.

403
00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:19,339
Yes, Officer Gu.

404
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,470
Excuse me.

405
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,549
I am looking for this person.
Have you seen her?

406
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:36,950
This person.

407
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:38,519
Oh, this woman.

408
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,619
- Have you seen her?
- Yes.

409
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:43,190
It is her, is she not?

410
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,259
No, she is not!

411
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,940
So, with one hand,
I grabbed him by the collar.

412
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,339
And I tripped him and made him fall.

413
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:03,079
Then, I shoved raw meat in his mouth.

414
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,390
How strange.

415
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:17,890
Do you not feel weird around me?

416
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:20,859
What?

417
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:24,500
If not, it cannot be like this.

418
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,210
Normal men
either stutter in front of me...

419
00:29:31,339 --> 00:29:33,079
or cannot look me in the eyes.

420
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:47,720
I guess the rumor is true.

421
00:29:48,859 --> 00:29:50,730
You are here alone with me.

422
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,759
And yet you are
neither flushing nor stammering.

423
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,150
I do not know how long it has been...

424
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,390
since I last laughed like this.

425
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:28,200
When did you speak the Joseon language?

426
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,730
No, actually,

427
00:30:32,069 --> 00:30:33,740
why are you, the princess,
wearing a disguise...

428
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:37,039
and spending your time
catching runaway captives?

429
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,049
I have been to Joseon several times
since I was young.

430
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:46,349
If I say that it was I who told
His Majesty about the state of Joseon,

431
00:30:47,549 --> 00:30:48,720
would you believe me?

432
00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:58,529
But now, His Majesty...

433
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,400
must not need my help anymore.

434
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,000
He dislikes women being active
in society more and more.

435
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,970
He told me to just keep
the palace women in line.

436
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:15,250
I was bored,
so I decided to hunt for captives.

437
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:20,250
You know,

438
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,890
even if my country were to
lose in the war,

439
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,789
I would rather die...

440
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:28,059
than become a captive.

441
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,490
Watching people want to live...

442
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:32,859
when they have been taken captive...

443
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:35,829
seems so pathetic in my eyes.

444
00:31:48,109 --> 00:31:49,849
You must not have had anything...

445
00:31:49,849 --> 00:31:51,880
go against your wishes ever in your life.

446
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:59,359
There are things in this world
that do not go as you wish.

447
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:05,430
You may be determined,

448
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,509
but you can never be certain.

449
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:19,509
There are such things.

450
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,549
You must have...

451
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:31,690
had such an experience.

452
00:33:09,329 --> 00:33:10,329
Move it.

453
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,230
I can walk on my own.

454
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,319
I thought Joseon people...

455
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,490
were either one of two types.

456
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:44,660
Either they were scared of us
for being intruders,

457
00:33:45,529 --> 00:33:48,799
or they looked down on us
because we were intruders.

458
00:33:51,069 --> 00:33:52,369
However...

459
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:55,940
You are peculiar.

460
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,380
You are not scared.

461
00:34:00,579 --> 00:34:01,609
But neither...

462
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,420
do you look down on us.

463
00:34:07,819 --> 00:34:10,320
How can I look down on someone...

464
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,920
as bright and beautiful as you?

465
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:31,570
We are outdoors.

466
00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:37,309
In that case,

467
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:39,179
shall we head inside?

468
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,920
You should...

469
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,860
be my bed attendant too.

470
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:55,059
Since the royalty makes Joseon maids
serve them in bed,

471
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:59,699
I should make a Joseon man
serve me in bed too.

472
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,110
First of all, I am not a captive.

473
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:08,710
Neither am I a palace servant.

474
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:14,679
If a mere Joseon interpreter like me
gets involved with royalty,

475
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,989
I might lose my life.

476
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:20,190
Please...

477
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,590
spare my humble life.

478
00:35:35,139 --> 00:35:38,269
It was bad enough
when they forced us to farm.

479
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:41,639
How can they demand
immediate military rations?

480
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,110
We should report it to Joseon.
What does Your Highness think?

481
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,369
Call for Lee Jang Hyun.

482
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:21,150
Are you giving me
the rest of my punishment?

483
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:23,820
How dare you jest?

484
00:36:29,659 --> 00:36:30,789
The Qing...

485
00:36:31,929 --> 00:36:35,599
have demanded that we send rations
to the Songshan battlefield on time.

486
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:40,070
We have already exhausted our resources
from Pyongan and Hamgyong.

487
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:44,170
How can they demand workers and horses
to ferry another 5,000 seok of goods?

488
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,150
Yong Gol Dae is trying
to intimidate me again.

489
00:36:53,449 --> 00:36:56,420
You commended me for enduring his attacks.

490
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,190
But facing such humiliation
as a crown prince is...

491
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:02,019
Your Highness.

492
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:06,400
I do not think that our captives...

493
00:37:07,429 --> 00:37:09,869
are swallowing the humiliation
at the captive market.

494
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:13,300
They are people
who chose their right to live.

495
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:16,409
They are fighting against hunger,

496
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:18,570
beatings, and the cold.

497
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,340
More than ever, they are...

498
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:23,210
aggressively wishing
for their right to live.

499
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,019
If they survive for yet another day,

500
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,420
they become brave warriors...

501
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,719
who won their battles for another day.

502
00:37:36,929 --> 00:37:39,159
Your views keep getting sillier.

503
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:40,800
Did our scholars...

504
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:45,869
wish for your utmost loyalty to the Ming?

505
00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:47,869
But you see,

506
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,639
you are the future of our country.

507
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:52,510
(Gukbon: the crown prince
who will inherit the throne)

508
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:55,440
By staying here
and humoring their demands,

509
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,210
you also are showing your loyalty.

510
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,920
Because you are here,

511
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:06,590
Joseon can prevent another war.

512
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,929
Because you work so hard
to ease the burdens of the people,

513
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,730
it is a true act...

514
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,670
of staying loyal to your people.

515
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,570
I...

516
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:27,380
will do my best
to gather more wagons and workers...

517
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,610
even if they might not be enough.

518
00:38:31,179 --> 00:38:32,309
This is...

519
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,619
my loyalty...

520
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,719
to Your Highness as your subject.

521
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,760
From me to Your Highness,

522
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,130
and Your Highness...

523
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,730
to the people of Joseon,

524
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,369
we shall keep our loyalty.

525
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:07,119
The Joseon crown prince
seems to favor and trust him.

526
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,980
He summoned him...

527
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,250
and they had a long talk.

528
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:14,659
I thought Joseon people
were strict about class.

529
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,190
But the crown prince confides
in an interpreter, I see.

530
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,559
What else?

531
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:23,530
He does not have any women
he is chummy with.

532
00:39:24,769 --> 00:39:26,969
All he does in his free time
is drink alone.

533
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:31,039
He does not have any lovers?

534
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:32,639
Sounds like the truth.

535
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,849
Yet,

536
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,849
he refuses me?

537
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:49,530
Have you seen this lady?

538
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:51,730
Have you seen her?

539
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,130
Excuse me,

540
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,659
have you seen this lady?

541
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,940
Excuse me, have you seen this lady?

542
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,619
Bak Dae.

543
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,699
Looking for a captive?

544
00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:34,469
What do you need?

545
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,210
Woman?

546
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,769
Man?

547
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,650
Do you know her?

548
00:41:26,659 --> 00:41:27,920
This country...

549
00:41:29,289 --> 00:41:32,929
faced successive wars
in the Years of Jeongmyo and Byeongja.

550
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:37,030
Our crown prince was taken away
and our people are dying.

551
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,670
His Majesty has been perplexed ever since.

552
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,170
In times like this,

553
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:48,610
we Confucian scholars have
to regain the people's displaced faith.

554
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:52,179
What do we have to do?

555
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:58,389
Remember the teachings of wise men...

556
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,719
who agonized over turbulent times.

557
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,159
(Sunghyun: saints and sages)

558
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:05,389
We have to return to those roots.

559
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:25,480
Please help Gil Chae return safely.

560
00:42:25,849 --> 00:42:29,449
Please watch over Officer Gu
who left to bring Gil Chae back.

561
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,590
Gil Chae and Jong Jong.

562
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:35,289
Please watch over them
so they may return safe and sound.

563
00:42:35,289 --> 00:42:36,429
Madam.

564
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:39,400
Madam,

565
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,929
Officer Gu has returned.

566
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:54,510
Officer Gu, where is Gil Chae?

567
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:10,429
Goodness.

568
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:12,860
You should have returned with Madam Yoo.

569
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,329
How could you come without her?

570
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,469
Officer Gu said we should just come back.

571
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:18,869
What was I supposed to do?

572
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:21,139
Goodness.

573
00:43:29,309 --> 00:43:30,380
Soo Ji...

574
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,349
Do not say my name.

575
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:35,579
Soo Ji, I missed you a lot.

576
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:36,750
Gosh, you smell.

577
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:37,789
Go away.

578
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:39,789
You should not be smiling.

579
00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:52,739
I already sold her.

580
00:43:53,739 --> 00:43:55,300
Do you want to know who I sold her to?

581
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:01,579
By now, she is probably exhausted...

582
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:05,210
after doing everything with that man.

583
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:12,289
Officer.

584
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,400
My lord,

585
00:45:02,739 --> 00:45:05,469
I will go to Simyang
and bring Gil Chae back.

586
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,780
In the meantime,

587
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:11,309
please look after Master Yoo,
Young Chae, and Je Nam.

588
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:16,719
My lady!

589
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:18,849
Madam.

590
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:19,889
Let us hurry.

591
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,030
My lady.

592
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:26,829
Why are you doing this?

593
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:29,260
I must go myself.

594
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:30,829
My lady.

595
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:33,739
Then should I just leave Gil Chae
to suffer?

596
00:45:34,539 --> 00:45:35,739
Please let me go.

597
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,909
I have to bring her back.

598
00:45:53,389 --> 00:45:55,519
You do not know what she means to me.

599
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,480
You are leaving?

600
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:16,449
So Ya.

601
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,449
No,

602
00:46:20,449 --> 00:46:21,579
you cannot leave.

603
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,630
Are you going...

604
00:46:32,929 --> 00:46:34,260
to that woman?

605
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:37,699
Yes.

606
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,400
Perhaps.

607
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:43,969
Even though...

608
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,440
we are far apart,

609
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:51,179
and even if I cannot see them
for the rest of my life,

610
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:55,320
I am tied to that person.

611
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:00,219
I am sorry.

612
00:47:09,969 --> 00:47:11,130
I know...

613
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,869
what that woman means to you.

614
00:47:13,869 --> 00:47:15,139
Just like me,

615
00:47:15,539 --> 00:47:17,469
you are tied to that woman as well.

616
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:21,380
If something bad happens to her,

617
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:25,150
you might go crazy.

618
00:47:40,099 --> 00:47:41,760
She made me like this!

619
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,070
Give me back my money.

620
00:47:44,329 --> 00:47:45,769
Give me back my money!

621
00:47:52,409 --> 00:47:54,179
She is a pain in the neck.

622
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:05,550
Where did you send Jong Jong?

623
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:11,289
Please tell me where you sent Jong Jong.

624
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:18,630
Your husband was here to find you.

625
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:37,849
Greetings, Your Highness.

626
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:41,420
How dare you make me wait?

627
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,190
You must want me out of your sight
because I have committed a sin.

628
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,059
I shall leave now.

629
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,099
Not a chance.

630
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:56,269
You are going to go hunting with me today.

631
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,320
If I make a mistake,

632
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,989
will those men kill me?

633
00:49:18,329 --> 00:49:19,389
That is right.

634
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:21,760
I am so scared.

635
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:26,170
I know you are not afraid of anything.

636
00:49:27,539 --> 00:49:29,570
But you still followed me
when I asked you to.

637
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:31,909
That must mean you do not dislike me.

638
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:40,079
At times, when I see you,

639
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:45,750
someone comes to mind.

640
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:53,630
I...

641
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:54,929
have a husband.

642
00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:00,300
My husband brought around 400 servants.

643
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:04,210
In front of the imperial garden,

644
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,039
he offered dozens of cows,

645
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:09,340
camels, and horses
with saddles to His Majesty...

646
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,679
and asked for me.

647
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,050
He was a prince of Chahar.

648
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:17,820
When His Majesty was conquering Chahar,

649
00:50:17,949 --> 00:50:20,460
he was the only one who won
against His Majesty.

650
00:50:22,489 --> 00:50:25,159
After holding a party
for seven days and nights,

651
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:28,260
he left saying he would be back
to take me with him.

652
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:31,329
I trusted him.

653
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,400
But he did not come back for years.

654
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,340
For the daughters of emperors,

655
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:41,710
it is normal
to go through arranged marriages.

656
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:46,110
I have no complaints about my fate.

657
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,150
But...

658
00:50:49,789 --> 00:50:50,949
that night,

659
00:50:52,989 --> 00:50:57,530
it looked like my husband
really wanted me.

660
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,059
I want to know if the look in his eyes...

661
00:51:02,429 --> 00:51:03,599
was fake.

662
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:17,050
I might have to get married
to a Mongolian prince...

663
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:20,219
in accordance with His Majesty's wishes.

664
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,690
But before that,

665
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,760
I am going to enjoy my life.

666
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:30,789
So, tonight,

667
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,860
you must serve me in bed.

668
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:59,789
I may be able to give you my body,

669
00:52:01,289 --> 00:52:03,019
but I cannot give you my heart.

670
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:06,630
Do you have a woman?

671
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:17,610
Yes.

672
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,880
She left me and married another man.

673
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:25,079
And yet,

674
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:28,050
you still like that woman?

675
00:52:30,619 --> 00:52:32,849
Did I not tell you?

676
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:37,429
You may be determined,

677
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:43,000
but some things...

678
00:52:44,699 --> 00:52:46,300
do not go as you wish.

679
00:52:49,869 --> 00:52:51,510
So,

680
00:52:52,039 --> 00:52:54,610
are you saying
you cannot serve me tonight?

681
00:53:01,949 --> 00:53:03,019
I am...

682
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:05,190
different from that woman.

683
00:53:07,219 --> 00:53:10,090
I will never abandon you.

684
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:18,570
Even if I marry another man in the future,

685
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,170
I will take you with me.

686
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:27,409
So, tonight, you must...

687
00:53:37,449 --> 00:53:39,420
serve me...

688
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:43,090
in bed.

689
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:16,989
Did you sleep well?

690
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:28,940
In Joseon, we drink...

691
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,170
honey water to fight hangovers.

692
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:35,409
I do not get drunk.

693
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:10,949
Last night, did we perhaps...

694
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,820
I mean, you and I...

695
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,750
Do not worry. Nothing happened.

696
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:33,300
Did you stoke the fire all night long?

697
00:55:35,639 --> 00:55:37,010
In case I get a cold?

698
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,309
It is still chilly in the early morning.

699
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:59,030
That is not true.

700
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:00,599
I am certain.

701
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:03,530
Gosh, if you did not see it,
then do not mention it.

702
00:56:03,969 --> 00:56:06,400
Jang Hyun may look clever,

703
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,969
but when it comes to Lady Gil Chae,
he becomes a total fool.

704
00:56:09,969 --> 00:56:11,610
Is the girl called Gil Chae?

705
00:56:11,909 --> 00:56:13,170
She is not just any girl.

706
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:15,139
She is a true noblewoman.

707
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:17,750
Jang Hyun is a nobleman as well,

708
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:19,309
even though he bought his title
with money.

709
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:21,750
I could tell at first glance.

710
00:56:22,349 --> 00:56:24,449
She was a fox with 99 tails.

711
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:26,889
But he did not know that
and fell head over heels for her.

712
00:56:26,889 --> 00:56:28,760
He ended up giving her everything he had.

713
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:30,460
Gosh, what is the point
of talking about this?

714
00:56:31,329 --> 00:56:33,190
No way. Lee Jang Hyun acting like a fool
because of a woman?

715
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:35,500
It is true.

716
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,869
Yang Chun,
I was not going to say this, but...

717
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:46,139
What?

718
00:56:46,139 --> 00:56:47,239
He cried?

719
00:56:47,239 --> 00:56:49,280
- Lee Jang Hyun cried?
- Yes.

720
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:51,880
That was the first time
I saw Jang Hyun cry too.

721
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:53,110
That says it all.

722
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,250
That must be why
he met with another woman.

723
00:56:59,889 --> 00:57:01,119
I swear.

724
00:57:01,889 --> 00:57:03,889
He must have spent the night
with another woman last night.

725
00:57:04,489 --> 00:57:06,460
There is no way, I tell you.

726
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,059
Do you want to bet?

727
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:12,400
You punk.
You are starting to take after Jang Hyun.

728
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:14,199
A bet? As if.

729
00:57:15,369 --> 00:57:17,239
- Are you not sure you can win?
- Fine, then.

730
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:32,650
What? What is it?

731
00:57:33,889 --> 00:57:34,989
What have you been up to?

732
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:36,760
Tell the truth.

733
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:40,929
You look as though you have been
sucked dry all night long.

734
00:57:40,929 --> 00:57:42,000
"Sucked dry?"

735
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,170
There are children present.

736
00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:46,530
You were with a woman, were you not?

737
00:57:47,699 --> 00:57:48,739
You were not, right?

738
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,099
There is no way.

739
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:52,639
Jang Hyun, you just got drunk
and fell asleep, right?

740
00:57:52,809 --> 00:57:53,809
No.

741
00:57:54,039 --> 00:57:56,309
He must have had all sorts of fun
all night...

742
00:57:56,309 --> 00:57:57,579
What are you saying?

743
00:57:58,909 --> 00:57:59,909
At night...

744
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:03,750
So, all night...

745
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:06,619
I was...

746
00:58:07,289 --> 00:58:08,320
with a woman...

747
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,659
We talked all night long...

748
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:14,400
until I came home.

749
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,659
I was right, was I not?

750
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:19,500
Gosh, Jang Hyun. Did you really
spend the night with a woman?

751
00:58:19,769 --> 00:58:20,800
So...

752
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:23,670
Well, I...

753
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:27,340
I was with her all night...

754
00:58:28,179 --> 00:58:29,539
We talked all night.

755
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:30,579
Okay?

756
00:58:30,579 --> 00:58:32,409
I came home after talking.

757
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:45,090
Your husband was here to find you.

758
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:49,329
An officer came with your portrait.

759
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:50,530
Did...

760
00:58:51,769 --> 00:58:53,070
my husband...

761
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:55,170
really come?

762
00:58:57,469 --> 00:58:58,940
But he went back.

763
00:59:00,309 --> 00:59:02,909
He heard that you had been sold
to another man...

764
00:59:02,909 --> 00:59:05,750
and gave up on you. That is what I mean.

765
00:59:08,179 --> 00:59:10,119
Things just had to go wrong. Darn it.

766
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:12,019
It is becoming so complicated.

767
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:29,920
He must still feel hotter than others.

768
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:42,170
This is weird.

769
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,940
Your husband...

770
01:01:45,409 --> 01:01:47,110
came back to get you.

771
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:51,010
I have never seen husbands like him.

772
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:15,800
What am I even thinking of?

773
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:19,900
I asked around.

774
01:03:20,469 --> 01:03:23,500
But there is no way we can get wagons
for that amount of rice.

775
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:24,869
Unless we build them.

776
01:03:28,739 --> 01:03:31,150
Jang Hyun, remember those days in Uiju?

777
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:34,079
When Jeolla rice was needed,

778
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:36,320
the Japanese office would
send silver to Jeolla Province,

779
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,090
and we would send Uiju silk to them.

780
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:40,960
With just a few words
and no wagons from us,

781
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,690
they would send over...

782
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:45,590
wagons full of rice from Jeolla Province.

783
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:55,400
What now?

784
01:03:58,610 --> 01:04:00,780
You have exceeded your master, it seems.

785
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,809
Since when was I your servant?

786
01:04:23,099 --> 01:04:24,199
Ryang Eum!

787
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:29,400
Have you been well?

788
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:35,210
No, not that.

789
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,280
Not a servant.

790
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:39,550
But they say the student surpasses...

791
01:04:39,550 --> 01:04:40,980
Stop denying!

792
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:42,550
You just said you were my master!

793
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:43,579
Yes, I did.

794
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:44,590
I said, "master."

795
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:45,789
But I meant a teacher.

796
01:04:45,789 --> 01:04:47,289
- Ryang Eum is here!
- A student...

797
01:04:49,889 --> 01:04:51,030
Goodness, it is Ryang Eum.

798
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:54,030
You did not even write.
How did you get here?

799
01:05:04,409 --> 01:05:05,809
I came to tell you something.

800
01:05:12,849 --> 01:05:13,909
You!

801
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:16,349
Yang Chun!

802
01:05:19,619 --> 01:05:20,760
Your leg...

803
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:27,699
Yang Chun.

804
01:05:28,099 --> 01:05:29,829
Why are you crying and making a fuss?

805
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,500
Stop crying.

806
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,530
Yes. Yang Chun still enjoys life...

807
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:35,239
and does everything with this leg.

808
01:05:35,239 --> 01:05:36,400
Do not worry.

809
01:05:38,409 --> 01:05:40,070
Yes, he is well and alive.

810
01:05:41,809 --> 01:05:42,880
Glad you came.

811
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:46,849
I am not here to see you.

812
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:54,719
I have something to say.

813
01:05:57,530 --> 01:05:58,590
What is it?

814
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:05,269
Lady Gil Chae...

815
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:08,239
I mean, Lady Yoo...

816
01:06:12,539 --> 01:06:13,670
She is in Simyang.

817
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:37,300
Go on.

818
01:06:53,449 --> 01:06:55,349
All right, everyone.

819
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:57,719
Keep your eyes peeled.

820
01:06:58,090 --> 01:07:00,190
This one is very rare.

821
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:02,360
A real...

822
01:07:03,289 --> 01:07:04,989
Joseon noblewoman!

823
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:09,130
A woman!

824
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:11,030
She is pretty.

825
01:07:15,469 --> 01:07:16,800
A Joseon woman.

826
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:20,070
A real Joseon noblewoman for sale!

827
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:23,679
She is a Joseon noblewoman!

828
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:28,820
You will not get
such a fine one elsewhere.

829
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,190
She is a real Joseon noblewoman.

830
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:32,389
See?

831
01:07:32,849 --> 01:07:34,559
Her skin is fair.

832
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:37,489
She has a scar,
but everything else is fine.

833
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:40,559
The perfect rare item!

834
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,860
Her price...

835
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:45,969
starts at 30 nyang.

836
01:07:46,199 --> 01:07:47,400
Name your price.

837
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,699
Thirty!

838
01:08:08,789 --> 01:08:10,619
I keep seeing things.

839
01:09:12,789 --> 01:09:13,789
What are you doing?

840
01:09:13,789 --> 01:09:15,390
Pay up if you want the girl!

841
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:21,659
Why are you...

842
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:38,439
Why...

843
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:40,770
are you...

844
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,060
How?

845
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:01,460
Why?

846
01:11:05,829 --> 01:11:07,000
Why?

847
01:11:13,609 --> 01:11:17,310
(My Dearest)

848
01:12:02,859 --> 01:12:03,890
It is strange.

849
01:12:04,659 --> 01:12:06,390
I am always with you...

850
01:12:07,329 --> 01:12:09,260
when the moon is bright.

851
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:12,899
She said she would destroy
Interpreter Lee.

852
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:14,840
My lord.

853
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:18,010
Do not do anything for me.

854
01:12:18,909 --> 01:12:19,939
No.

855
01:12:20,539 --> 01:12:22,239
I am going to do what I want.

856
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,109
You know, I do not let other women...

857
01:12:26,109 --> 01:12:27,979
steal the man I want away from me.

858
01:12:28,649 --> 01:12:30,550
Do not worry about anything.

859
01:12:30,979 --> 01:12:32,289
You do not have to worry.

860
01:12:32,289 --> 01:12:33,489
Gil Chae!

861
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:36,420
Let us go.

862
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:41,526
