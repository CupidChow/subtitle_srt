1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,310
(This drama is a work of fiction
created based on historical facts.)

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,980
(Most of the details and depictions
of the characters are fictional.)

3
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:07,509
Thank you for releasing Lady Yoo.

4
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:08,550
(Episode 16)

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:12,720
I said I would let that woman live.

6
00:00:13,449 --> 00:00:15,890
I did not say I would allow you
to keep her by your side.

7
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,420
Now, that girl...

8
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,489
must return to Joseon.

9
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:27,730
I am someone who keeps her promises.

10
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,739
I would never hurt a woman...

11
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:33,409
with my own hands.

12
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,380
However, bad things will happen
to the Joseon captives...

13
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:40,549
living in Simyang.

14
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,119
Even if they were released,

15
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:46,320
if someone else claims ownership of them,

16
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,520
they will become slaves again.

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,890
If they lose their release papers,

18
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,189
they will become escapees
and have their ankles slashed.

19
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:57,859
If they hold on to fake release papers,

20
00:00:57,859 --> 00:00:59,200
their ears will be pierced.

21
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,530
Or worse, beheaded...

22
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,640
Back off. We are sparring.

23
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,909
If you lay a finger on her,

24
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,219
I will kill you.

25
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,689
I understand...

26
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,390
how you feel.

27
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:33,299
You see, even the thought of you dying...

28
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,469
tortures me too.

29
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:42,310
You want to save her?

30
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:47,180
In that case,

31
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,849
send her to Joseon.

32
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:37,400
I am glad you came.

33
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,870
I was writing a letter to send to Joseon.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Have you decided...

35
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,009
to return to Joseon?

36
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,710
No.

37
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:53,240
I must repay the kindness
of the person who saved my life.

38
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,610
I am writing that I will not be able to
go to Joseon for the time being.

39
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,330
I will not leave.

40
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:15,030
If I am a curse to Interpreter Lee,

41
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,039
I am also the only one
who can break that curse.

42
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,169
If Lord Lee needs me,

43
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:22,770
I will stay for as long as necessary...

44
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,610
and help his recovery.

45
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:35,520
Your Majesty.

46
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,590
Congratulations on your victory in war.

47
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,689
We may have won,

48
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,659
but we have lost so many soldiers.

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,300
We have yet to conquer the Shanhai Pass.

50
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,099
(Shanhai Pass: an important region
at the eastern end of the Great Wall)

51
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:52,240
Your Majesty.

52
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,340
Enjoy the victory.

53
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,949
This moment onwards will be crucial.

54
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,060
We must prove that the Qing have been
given the right to rule from the skies.

55
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,460
To do so,

56
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:16,459
we must not lose the public's favor.

57
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:19,759
Gak Hwa.

58
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,800
It has been a long time since I have
put you in charge of the palace women.

59
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,740
I told you not to cause any problems...

60
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,310
about abusing a Joseon slave woman.

61
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,910
These days,

62
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:34,949
how are the women of the royal household?

63
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,819
How could I go against your order?

64
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,250
I have been...

65
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,350
managing them well.

66
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:44,860
I know...

67
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,620
I can trust in you.

68
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,199
Then, Your Majesty,

69
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:55,269
please put me in charge of
the Joseon captives as well.

70
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:01,370
Gak Hwa.

71
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:04,810
You are my daughter who has saved my life.

72
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,410
I could...

73
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,709
even give you the whole world.

74
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,149
I was aware...

75
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,250
that you were...

76
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:17,189
hunting for Joseon captives
while wearing a disguise.

77
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,829
However,

78
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:23,089
you must not cross the line.

79
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,160
If you treat the slaves cruelly,

80
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:28,629
we will lose the public's support.

81
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,970
So...

82
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,240
Your Majesty.

83
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,209
Call the royal physician.

84
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,269
Hurry!

85
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,879
Royal physician!

86
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,040
Where is the royal physician?

87
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,050
The news from Simyang
in recent days is quite unusual.

88
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:46,079
The Khan's illness must be severe.

89
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,250
He is severely ill?

90
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,660
The Khan would not have changed his mind
due to his illness, would he?

91
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,060
By any chance,

92
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,470
he will not blame me for the Ming ship...

93
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,430
that has appeared on Joseon shores,
will he?

94
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,870
Has Choi Myung Gil,
who has been taken to Simyang,

95
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,470
not sent any word?

96
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:17,649
At first, Choi Myung Gil said he would
take responsibility for everything.

97
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,420
how is it that he is still alive...

98
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,389
and only watching me being interrogated?

99
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:26,220
(Sim Ki Won)

100
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,459
Kim Sang Heon and Choi Myung GIl
were both taken to Qing.

101
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:33,930
The nobility will say once again...

102
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,629
that there are no worthy men
in our royal court.

103
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:41,339
Ask for Kim Jib and Jang Chul's advice...

104
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,339
and fill the royal court
with their pupils.

105
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:46,040
(Gueon: a king asking
his vassals for advice)

106
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,389
Now that Lord Choi Myung Gil is gone,

107
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,959
Kim Ja Jeom is on his high horse,

108
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,430
counting on his connections in Qing.

109
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,759
(Kim Ryu)

110
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,740
I must say,
His Majesty truly frightens me.

111
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:14,439
He used to completely rely on Lord Choi
and defend him.

112
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,079
Now, he wants him to take responsibility
for everything and pays with his life.

113
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,180
Who can we count on now?

114
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:27,949
Before I get roped into this too,

115
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:29,490
I will leave the royal court.

116
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:49,269
Master.

117
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:54,209
His Majesty is seeking your advice.

118
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,480
His Majesty ordered,
"Treasure Kim Jib and Jang Chul's advice,"

119
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,649
"no matter what they may be."

120
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:01,790
His Majesty said that?

121
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,620
His Majesty...

122
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,529
is seeking my advice,

123
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:46,360
but I am afraid my advice will
not be helpful for I lack in many ways.

124
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:51,870
However, I would like you...

125
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:55,009
to go to the royal court
and assist His Majesty.

126
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,750
But how could we go there when you decided
to decline His Majesty's request?

127
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,149
I agree.

128
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,720
Choi Myung Gil
and a few other ministers...

129
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,889
have been dragged to Qing
due to the secret interactions with Ming.

130
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,190
Once again, His Majesty handed
his loyal vassals over to the intruders.

131
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,120
Hence, we refuse to go to the royal court.

132
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,730
A wealthy family
that always whipped its servants...

133
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,559
was looking for someone
to supervise the servants.

134
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:20,830
Everyone declined the position,

135
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,429
saying they refused to work
as a supervisor under such an evil master.

136
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:25,240
But one man volunteered for the job.

137
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:28,639
He whipped the servants
in his master's stead...

138
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:31,179
but lessened the severity of the whipping.

139
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:36,850
So, the servants started cursing
the supervisor instead of their master.

140
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:40,049
Who do you think truly helped the people?

141
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,049
Those who declined the job?

142
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,720
Or the man who whipped the servants,

143
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,289
knowing they would curse him?

144
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,559
What should your choice be...

145
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:57,340
as true scholars?

146
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,870
To a king,

147
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,840
his ministers are like his hands and feet,

148
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,009
and his advisors are like
his eyes and ears.

149
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:11,919
At the moment, His Majesty's hands
and feet have been cut off,

150
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:13,779
and he has reached a dead-end.

151
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,759
What shall he do?

152
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:22,490
Go.

153
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,000
Go to the royal court...

154
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:30,070
and become His Majesty's eyes and ears.

155
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,570
Your Majesty.

156
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:14,909
Your Majesty.

157
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,299
I guess the rumor is true.

158
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:43,269
You are here alone with me.

159
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,340
And yet you are
neither flushing nor stammering.

160
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,809
The rumor goes that
you do not believe in marriage...

161
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,019
because you are
unable to function as a man.

162
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:59,789
Is it wrong?

163
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,529
There is no way.

164
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:07,570
In the past...

165
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,269
I was awfully foolish, was I not?

166
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,370
You were very...

167
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,009
beautiful.

168
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,009
I suppose...

169
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,519
the rumors I heard in Neunggun-ri
back in the day...

170
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,320
are true.

171
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:33,220
You are here alone with me.

172
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,230
And yet you are
neither flushing nor stammering.

173
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:40,659
They said
you were a white box with 99 tails.

174
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,100
It must be true.

175
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:16,200
Can we stay together?

176
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:21,740
If you do not like it here,

177
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,340
I will go...

178
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:30,210
wherever you want.

179
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:37,250
Your husband abandoned you,

180
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:42,590
despite knowing you were in Simyang.

181
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:50,870
Hence,

182
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,940
you no longer need to stay loyal to him.

183
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,179
So please...

184
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,769
First,

185
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:27,169
I must speak with Officer Gu
and hear his reason.

186
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:34,980
Right.

187
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,720
You have a husband, after all.

188
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:45,019
You have a husband, a father,

189
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,190
and a sibling too.

190
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,269
Yes.

191
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:39,340
I have a father, a husband,
and a sibling as well.

192
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,919
But there is someone who saved my life.

193
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:49,120
For you,

194
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,419
I can gladly sacrifice my life.

195
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,029
- However...
- However?

196
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,500
You cannot love me?

197
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:22,389
I never wished for you to die in my place.

198
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,159
What I want is...

199
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,059
My Lord,

200
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,630
I...

201
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,880
Hey, Interpreter Lee.

202
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:53,440
Interpreter Lee!

203
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,839
What is so urgent?

204
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,309
What is the matter?

205
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,910
Khan is dead.

206
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:34,849
Khan...

207
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:35,849
is dead?

208
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:37,720
Then...

209
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,190
who will succeed to the throne?

210
00:18:56,109 --> 00:18:58,480
(Dorgon: Hong Taiji's half-brother)

211
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:18,460
Khan's son, who has just turned six,
has acceded to the throne.

212
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:21,829
And the former king, Dorgon,
has become the king regent.

213
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:23,400
(Regent: a person who administers
a country in place of the monarch)

214
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,430
Then...

215
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:28,339
are you saying the world is now Dorgon's?

216
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:31,609
Yes.

217
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,039
The world...

218
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:36,250
is now Dorgon's.

219
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,220
However,

220
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,250
Dorgon did not have the power
to sit on the throne himself,

221
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,890
so he made a young child
accede to the throne...

222
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,059
and had to be satisfied
with being the king regent.

223
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,859
Dorgon has not taken complete control
over the Qing yet.

224
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:56,829
Just as the former emperor...

225
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,869
buried Dorgon's mother alive
as soon as he acceded to the throne,

226
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,710
Dorgon will also...

227
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,410
do whatever he can...

228
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,980
to strengthen his power.

229
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:12,880
Then...

230
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,349
what will happen to Joseon?

231
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,029
Then...

232
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:27,000
what do you think Dorgon will do
with Joseon?

233
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,099
In the Year of Byeongja,

234
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,869
there were people...

235
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:36,309
who wanted to kill me and make
one of their people the king of Joseon.

236
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,079
If those people rise to power,

237
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:40,740
what do I do?

238
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,210
In the Year of Byeongja,

239
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:45,049
there were people who proposed...

240
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:47,680
dividing up Joseon
amongst the princes of the Qing.

241
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,589
If those people stick to Dorgon...

242
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:51,859
and gain power,

243
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,890
what will happen to Joseon?

244
00:20:59,829 --> 00:21:02,430
We will soon be able to see...

245
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:05,569
who Dorgon will choose
to have by his side.

246
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,140
In the next few months,

247
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:11,109
whoever Dorgon reaches his hand out to,

248
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,339
are the people
who will work with Dorgon in the future.

249
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:16,710
That is why...

250
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,849
we must start moving too.

251
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:23,049
I...

252
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,960
will meet General Yong Gol Dae...

253
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:27,960
and study what Dorgon has planned.

254
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,650
It is a gift
from the Crown Prince's heart.

255
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,490
It is a statue of Buddha...

256
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,529
that the Crown Prince made just for you.

257
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,029
The Crown Prince...

258
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,400
made it for me?

259
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,670
In Joseon,

260
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,500
women spend money
to make statues of the Buddha,

261
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,339
wishing for peace
when their husbands go out to work.

262
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:18,440
You are also...

263
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,680
nervous, are you not?

264
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,279
You do not know anything.

265
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,269
I know you are nervous.

266
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:50,670
Since...

267
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:54,440
the former king
has become the king regent,

268
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,380
(The former king: Dorgon)

269
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,950
you...

270
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:01,319
may be purged.

271
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,319
However,

272
00:23:06,589 --> 00:23:08,329
that must not happen.

273
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,259
The Great Qing acquired Joseon...

274
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:13,829
thanks to whom?

275
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,930
The people who should be thanked...

276
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,470
for acquiring Joseon...

277
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:22,109
are you and the king regent.

278
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,210
The person who knows
about this fact the best...

279
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,309
is our Crown Prince.

280
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,750
Our Crown Prince...

281
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,950
trusts you...

282
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,380
and supports you.

283
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:36,920
In the Year of Byeongja, some princes...

284
00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:39,259
wanted to divide Joseon up...

285
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,160
amongst themselves.

286
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,329
And some people...

287
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,759
wanted to kill the king of Joseon...

288
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,170
and rule the country themselves.

289
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,900
However,

290
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,970
only the king regent and you,
General Yong Gol Dae,

291
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,970
requested for Joseon to be protected,
is that not right?

292
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,579
- That is...
- Do you...

293
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,250
remember now?

294
00:24:05,349 --> 00:24:06,549
Therefore, in return,

295
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,420
when the Crown Prince...

296
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,589
becomes the king of Joseon,

297
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:14,259
the rights and interests
of all the products of Joseon...

298
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:16,890
will only be given...

299
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,259
to you and the regent king.

300
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:22,099
Joseon...

301
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:25,000
with you,

302
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,839
you...

303
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,140
with the king regent,

304
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,309
The king regent, you,

305
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:36,809
and Joseon...

306
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,450
will move forward together.

307
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:51,089
What?

308
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:52,630
Dorgon...

309
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,799
allowed the Crown Prince to visit Joseon?

310
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,509
Congratulations.

311
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,250
Then...

312
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,680
am I also allowed to go to Joseon?

313
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,349
Can I see...

314
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:16,250
my mother?

315
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,920
It is all thanks to you.

316
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,660
That is not true, Your Highness.

317
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,690
No.

318
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:28,099
In the past, when my father passed away,

319
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,640
he did not let me go to Joseon
even when I offered all sorts of bribes.

320
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,809
But this time,
you made Dorgon change his mind...

321
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:38,609
and gave me a chance to visit my mother.

322
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,779
It has now been revealed.

323
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:47,720
Who Dorgon...

324
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,319
wants to join forces with.

325
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:09,940
Greetings, General.

326
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,910
To thank you
for allowing her to visit Joseon,

327
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:15,849
the Crown Princess...

328
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:20,450
wants to send white paper...

329
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,720
You punk.

330
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,049
Why have you gotten
on the bad side of Her Highness?

331
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,460
The king regent wants Her Highness
to be one of his people.

332
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:31,160
Her Highness has power
over the women in the royal family.

333
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:33,329
But...

334
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:35,200
when the king regent
reached out his hand to her,

335
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,869
Her Highness demanded two things.

336
00:26:37,369 --> 00:26:38,440
First,

337
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:40,170
she said she would not get married
to a Mongolian man.

338
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:41,740
Second,

339
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,480
She asked for the authority
to catch Joseon's runaway captives.

340
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:49,309
She is aware...

341
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,019
of the fact that you have been
selling captives and giving me the money.

342
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,450
If the king regent
complies with her requests,

343
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:55,920
Her Highness will search you first.

344
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,890
Then I will get caught.

345
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,190
How will you manage to handle this?

346
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:03,890
Whose orders...

347
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:05,960
are Her Highness working under?

348
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,829
Is she targeting me? Or...

349
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:12,240
does she just want a share of my wealth?

350
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,180
Why are you doing this?

351
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,250
What is it...

352
00:28:05,789 --> 00:28:06,920
that you want?

353
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:08,390
You.

354
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,799
You are what I want.

355
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:17,970
But if you do not come to me,

356
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:23,009
I will take you and the captives
you have with you...

357
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:26,980
and bury all of you.

358
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,890
If you want to bury all the captives...

359
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:41,589
just to have that woman,

360
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,890
you can go ahead.

361
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:07,650
Yong Yi, 30 nyang.

362
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:10,289
When I return to Joseon
and harvest barley and rice,

363
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:11,490
I will certainly repay my debt.

364
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,789
Chang Sam, 50 nyang.

365
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:17,690
I will repay this kindness even in death.

366
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,799
Dool Ne, 50 nyang.

367
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:21,700
My sons are waiting.

368
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,569
Sam Seok, 70 nyang.

369
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:32,140
If you only send me back to Joseon,
I will serve you as my master for life.

370
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,259
So,

371
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:48,089
do as Her Highness says.

372
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,589
General.

373
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,740
Will the king regent sit back
and watch this?

374
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,200
Do you not get it?

375
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,910
Soon, we will conquer the Shanhai Pass.

376
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,309
The Ming Empire is falling.

377
00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:08,910
Soon, the Qing army will arrive in Beijing
and the central region will belong to us.

378
00:30:09,609 --> 00:30:10,609
So,

379
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:12,279
the king regent does not care...

380
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:13,680
if Her Highness takes the captives.

381
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:17,420
I do not care...

382
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,359
if Her Highness kills the captives or not.

383
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,230
Now, Joseon's captives...

384
00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:25,599
will be forgotten.

385
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,539
I heard you asked to see me.

386
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:44,579
Are you all finished
with your urgent work?

387
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:52,089
My lord.

388
00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:55,660
About what happened before...

389
00:31:00,329 --> 00:31:01,329
So...

390
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,670
Dorgon has...

391
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:12,380
allowed the Crown Prince
to make a trip to Joseon.

392
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,609
You should also return
to Joseon with them.

393
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,019
It would be safest to return...

394
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:23,589
while the Crown Prince heads to Joseon.

395
00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:30,930
But you are still not fully recovered...

396
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,529
Do not mind my illness any longer.

397
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,000
I do not need you to nurse me.

398
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:39,900
But...

399
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:52,349
Have you forgotten?

400
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,029
We are...

401
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,960
not anything to one another.

402
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,099
So, do not...

403
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:20,039
feel indebted to me in any way.

404
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:24,549
I have...

405
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,390
clung onto you,

406
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:35,059
and I have...

407
00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:40,299
gotten over a near-death experience
thanks to you.

408
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:45,099
I have done all I have wished for.

409
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,470
So, now,

410
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,410
in my heart,

411
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:01,779
there is nothing left.

412
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:04,049
So go back.

413
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,519
My lord.

414
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,130
You have...

415
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:16,869
a lot on your mind
because the Khan is dead, right?

416
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,470
- That is why...
- Also,

417
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:28,140
I have grown tired of you
who always pushes me away.

418
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:32,650
Yes.

419
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,259
I am sick and tired now.

420
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:46,099
So,

421
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:52,339
please go back.

422
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:58,109
What if I do not want to?

423
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,680
If I...

424
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,750
say I do not want to go back...

425
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,450
You are a married woman.
Do you not have any shame?

426
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:36,469
Let us go to Joseon.

427
00:35:39,409 --> 00:35:40,409
Madam.

428
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,980
That is what he wants.

429
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,780
I want to do...

430
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,179
as he wants.

431
00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:04,400
So, just tell her
that you wish to stay here.

432
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,199
How could I stay when Lady Yoo
has made up her mind to leave?

433
00:36:09,469 --> 00:36:10,769
Make your choice.

434
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:12,710
Will you choose me or Lady Yoo?

435
00:36:13,309 --> 00:36:14,380
That is...

436
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:18,050
Lady Yoo, of course.

437
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,849
Jong Jong.

438
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,219
I hear you wish to join us
on our upcoming visit to Joseon...

439
00:36:26,989 --> 00:36:28,960
and return home.

440
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,590
Yes, Your Highness.

441
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:34,000
My family is waiting for me in Joseon.

442
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,099
Yes, you should return home.

443
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,579
I am still deeply indebted to you...

444
00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:54,250
for saving my son.

445
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,820
Once...

446
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:01,360
His Highness the Crown Prince
ascends the throne,

447
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:05,260
I will be sure to repay you.

448
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:13,539
You have already done so much for me.

449
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:20,039
The days I spent here
helping out at the farm...

450
00:37:23,949 --> 00:37:27,019
will be remembered
as the happiest time of my life.

451
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,289
My lord.

452
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,860
Are you inside?

453
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:05,150
I have let the Crown Princess know.

454
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:11,090
I will be joining the Crown Princess
on her upcoming trip...

455
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:16,030
to return to Joseon.

456
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:23,039
That is good news.

457
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,280
However, I have a lot to do,

458
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:34,250
so I do not think I can see you off.

459
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,989
You must truly be...

460
00:38:43,929 --> 00:38:45,730
sick and tired of me.

461
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,599
All I do is inconvenience you.

462
00:38:52,969 --> 00:38:54,239
I am ashamed,

463
00:38:55,369 --> 00:38:56,670
and I feel pathetic.

464
00:39:04,849 --> 00:39:06,179
Such a thought...

465
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,650
has never once occurred to me.

466
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:14,889
So...

467
00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:19,199
once you are back in Joseon,

468
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:26,170
forget all your sufferings in Simyang...

469
00:39:29,539 --> 00:39:30,769
and live a good life.

470
00:39:36,449 --> 00:39:37,750
A flashy...

471
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,690
and glamorous one.

472
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,559
Be you, Gil Chae.

473
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,550
Yes.

474
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,289
I promise you
that I will live such a life.

475
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:22,389
Now, I have a goal.

476
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:28,599
I never wish...

477
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,699
to cause you harm again.

478
00:40:36,139 --> 00:40:37,239
Yes.

479
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,610
I will return to Joseon...

480
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:43,679
and stay brave...

481
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,079
to show the world...

482
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,920
that I can live a good life.

483
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,230
Thank you.

484
00:41:09,409 --> 00:41:10,940
And I am truly...

485
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:15,409
sorry.

486
00:43:12,429 --> 00:43:13,599
Goodbye.

487
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:18,170
Return home...

488
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,269
and live like a flower.

489
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,449
That is...

490
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,789
all I want.

491
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,260
I bet you want to kill me.

492
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:35,199
Yes.

493
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,340
If you would let me.

494
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:42,679
You must resent me,

495
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,780
but the people in Joseon
have forgotten all about the captives.

496
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,789
No one is even coming to us
to ask to have them released.

497
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,789
So, even if something were
to happen to them, no one would care.

498
00:45:54,489 --> 00:45:56,260
No one cares.

499
00:45:56,829 --> 00:45:57,829
They are like...

500
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:00,030
orphans without parents.

501
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:04,630
What I am curious about...

502
00:46:05,699 --> 00:46:08,400
is why you gave up
on the woman you love...

503
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:12,940
just because
of those insignificant captives.

504
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:22,420
Why did you do that?

505
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:28,360
Because Lee Jang Hyun...

506
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:32,630
cannot ignore those
who are insignificant and pitiful.

507
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,059
How foolish.

508
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:41,039
I am certain
that your ridiculous sympathy...

509
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:44,170
will one day hold you back.

510
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:46,309
Is that what you think?

511
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,610
I do not care about others.

512
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,349
Is that so?

513
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:59,409
What are you doing?

514
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:03,190
Why...

515
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:06,789
Why did you save me?

516
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:11,059
It would have been better
for you if I died.

517
00:48:18,099 --> 00:48:19,170
Yes,

518
00:48:20,769 --> 00:48:23,070
you are a man
who saves people who are falling.

519
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:29,340
Then, Lee Jang Hyun,

520
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:33,920
will you save me as well?

521
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:46,090
I am scared.

522
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:51,829
I have never...

523
00:48:53,269 --> 00:48:55,800
lived in a world without my father.

524
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:01,110
You must hate me,

525
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,449
but for a short while,

526
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,050
allow me to stay next to you.

527
00:49:10,849 --> 00:49:11,920
Please.

528
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:26,099
Gosh.

529
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,699
Khan...

530
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:31,309
did not allow the Crown Prince...

531
00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:34,710
to return to Joseon for several years
after dragging him away.

532
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,150
How is it that Dorgon
allowed the Crown Prince...

533
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:41,619
to return to Joseon
as soon as he became the king regent?

534
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:44,019
The Crown Princess' father
had passed away,

535
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,190
so they pleaded
that they could pay their last respects...

536
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:48,260
So what I am asking is...

537
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:53,630
did Dorgon comply
with the Crown Prince's request?

538
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,500
Goodness.

539
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:58,300
Your Majesty,

540
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,840
the Crown Prince has entered the capital.

541
00:50:18,219 --> 00:50:19,219
Your Highness.

542
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,389
His Majesty cannot see you today...

543
00:50:21,389 --> 00:50:23,289
for he is ill.

544
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:25,230
If you go and wait...

545
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:27,900
Your Majesty,

546
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,329
I am here.

547
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,369
I am here to pay my respects.

548
00:50:35,239 --> 00:50:36,269
All right.

549
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,809
His Majesty did not allow
the Crown Princess...

550
00:50:42,809 --> 00:50:44,610
to visit her mother who is alone...

551
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:47,119
nor to cry in front
of her father's ancestral tablet.

552
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,449
On top of that,

553
00:50:49,889 --> 00:50:51,550
the eunuchs are torturing
the court ladies every day...

554
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:53,190
as they investigate
the curse of the palace.

555
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:55,159
"The curse of the palace?"

556
00:50:56,989 --> 00:50:58,630
Are you talking about the rumor?

557
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:02,960
The rumor has been going around
for a while.

558
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:05,570
Did you trace the root of the rumor?

559
00:51:07,369 --> 00:51:08,639
Censors...

560
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:11,809
need to inform His Majesty
of any rumors that have spread.

561
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:15,840
But if you relay groundless rumors
without even checking the facts,

562
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:18,309
how would you expect your words
to carry any weight?

563
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:21,349
Yes, Master.

564
00:51:21,349 --> 00:51:24,349
I will make sure to check and see
if the rumor is true or not.

565
00:51:31,329 --> 00:51:32,860
I am the Senior Sixth Rank officer
of the Office of Royal Decrees.

566
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:35,599
According to the rumors, court ladies
are being tortured in prison...

567
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:01,489
I am the Senior Sixth Rank officer
of the Office of Royal Decrees.

568
00:52:01,989 --> 00:52:03,889
I am investigating the rumor
that has been going around.

569
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,389
Is it...

570
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,409
Father, stay still.

571
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:20,780
Your arm. Yes.

572
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:22,840
Can you move your hand this way?

573
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:24,079
There we go.

574
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:30,449
Am I going to meet Gil Chae?

575
00:52:30,949 --> 00:52:31,989
Yes.

576
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:34,260
We need to meet Gil Chae soon.

577
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,659
Eun Ae,
do not say stuff like that anymore.

578
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:44,469
Lord Yoo!

579
00:52:46,099 --> 00:52:47,440
Madam is here.

580
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:49,239
"Madam?"

581
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:50,639
Father.

582
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:54,380
Eun Ae.

583
00:52:58,150 --> 00:52:59,179
Young Chae.

584
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:00,349
Gil Chae.

585
00:53:03,789 --> 00:53:04,849
Gil Chae.

586
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:06,289
You are here.

587
00:53:06,289 --> 00:53:08,659
What took you so long?

588
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:10,559
Goodness.

589
00:53:10,789 --> 00:53:11,829
Madam Bang Doo.

590
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,070
Eun Ae.

591
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,239
It is actually you,

592
00:53:23,469 --> 00:53:24,739
Gil Chae.

593
00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:33,250
You are Gil Chae.

594
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:52,300
Father.

595
00:53:58,170 --> 00:53:59,909
Madam is here, Lord.

596
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:13,760
Father.

597
00:54:47,789 --> 00:54:48,920
It is warm, right?

598
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:50,860
Let us sleep here tonight.

599
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,730
The sheets are freshly laundered.

600
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:58,630
Gosh, where should I sleep tonight?

601
00:55:03,869 --> 00:55:05,010
Jong Jong.

602
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:07,239
You worked hard.

603
00:55:07,239 --> 00:55:08,380
It must have been tough.

604
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:17,320
So...

605
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,349
Soo Ji...

606
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:21,920
I said I would sleep
with Jong Jong tonight.

607
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:24,960
I came to get a pillow.

608
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:26,559
Well, then...

609
00:55:26,929 --> 00:55:28,800
Jong Jong, sleep well.

610
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:29,929
I will.

611
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:33,900
Seriously.

612
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:39,539
Go away.

613
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:47,949
You must still be so lovey-dovey
every night these days.

614
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:50,989
That fool will not even get tired
in his old age.

615
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:55,090
Come on. I know you like it.

616
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,219
Who, me?

617
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:57,559
Me?

618
00:55:57,889 --> 00:55:59,030
If not, then forget it.

619
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:06,400
It is nice.

620
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:23,650
Officer Gu...

621
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:26,320
stays at his family home these days?

622
00:56:26,889 --> 00:56:27,960
Yes.

623
00:56:28,789 --> 00:56:31,090
He went all the way to Simyang
to find you,

624
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:34,659
but he ran into a thief
and had all his money stolen.

625
00:56:36,099 --> 00:56:38,900
He was just getting ready to head back.

626
00:56:42,539 --> 00:56:43,809
I see.

627
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:47,780
By the way, Gil Chae...

628
00:56:48,809 --> 00:56:49,940
Yes?

629
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:52,780
While you were in Qing,

630
00:56:54,679 --> 00:56:58,519
a foreign intruder did not
take advantage of you, did he?

631
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:01,460
Young Chae.

632
00:57:01,789 --> 00:57:03,690
What are you saying on such a happy day?

633
00:57:04,389 --> 00:57:05,960
Who do you take Gil Chae for?

634
00:57:12,969 --> 00:57:14,199
It is like a dream.

635
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:18,639
Right.

636
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,679
My sister is no ordinary woman.

637
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:52,369
Thank you...

638
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:57,150
for coming back.

639
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:02,349
Thank you so much.

640
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:20,869
Let us go.

641
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:25,070
I will be late tonight. Do not wait up.

642
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:26,239
Okay.

643
00:58:39,889 --> 00:58:40,960
Gil Chae.

644
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:55,469
Is it really you?

645
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:01,510
Who is...

646
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:03,280
that woman?

647
00:59:05,809 --> 00:59:08,119
Do not worry.
I will take care of everything.

648
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:09,820
Before that,

649
00:59:11,849 --> 00:59:12,949
while you were there,

650
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:17,489
nothing happened to you, right?

651
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,539
What will you do now?

652
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,019
She was taken captive...

653
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:52,260
- and came back after being roughed up.
- Roughed up how?

654
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:53,590
Are you asking that
because you do not know?

655
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,230
You made it back alive.

656
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:57,030
You brought shame on all Joseon women.

657
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:58,230
I know, right?

658
00:59:58,230 --> 00:59:59,670
How shameless.

659
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,639
You must have such thick skin.

660
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,840
What did you just say?

661
01:00:03,869 --> 01:00:04,869
Jong Jong.

662
01:00:04,869 --> 01:00:07,239
What did you say?
How dare you talk with that dirty mouth?

663
01:00:07,239 --> 01:00:08,840
What? You dirty wench
who has been with foreign intruders.

664
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,239
How dare you?

665
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:16,079
I told you not to respond to barking dogs.

666
01:00:16,849 --> 01:00:17,920
Let us go.

667
01:00:23,659 --> 01:00:24,690
Gil Chae.

668
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:27,900
I spoke with your husband.

669
01:00:28,929 --> 01:00:31,800
He has no intention of divorcing you.

670
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,940
But before that,

671
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:36,469
he wants to hear your answer.

672
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:40,679
If nothing happened,

673
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:42,710
you just have to say so.

674
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:46,380
Gil Chae.

675
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:50,449
Did a foreign intruder
really take advantage of you or something?

676
01:00:50,449 --> 01:00:51,519
Young Chae.

677
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:10,639
That man's daughter came back
from being taken captive in Qing,

678
01:01:11,239 --> 01:01:12,869
and when asked what happened
between her and foreign intruders,

679
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:14,010
she would not answer.

680
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:16,780
And yet she wants to take back her spot
in the bedroom?

681
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:20,110
Seeing how she could not prove
her chastity, she must have...

682
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:22,179
If she was that afraid to die,

683
01:01:22,449 --> 01:01:24,090
she should have just stayed hidden.

684
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:25,489
How shameless.

685
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:27,320
Father.

686
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:28,719
What is "chastity?"

687
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:31,929
That hurts, Father.

688
01:02:36,659 --> 01:02:38,059
Gil Chae.

689
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:43,969
When you were born,

690
01:02:43,969 --> 01:02:46,530
I felt like I had
the whole world in my hands.

691
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:53,510
I enjoyed all the joys in the world
while raising you.

692
01:02:59,949 --> 01:03:01,880
My precious daughter.

693
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:08,590
My darling girl.

694
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,159
However,

695
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:21,699
you will have to live
in a nightmare for the rest of your life.

696
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:25,969
What should we do?

697
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:33,210
There is nothing I can do for you.

698
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:37,289
What should I do?

699
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,630
No.

700
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:57,639
I will help you.

701
01:04:00,139 --> 01:04:01,739
So that you will not live...

702
01:04:03,309 --> 01:04:05,909
in a nightmare for the rest of your life,

703
01:04:07,849 --> 01:04:10,179
your father will help you.

704
01:04:30,739 --> 01:04:31,940
Gil Chae.

705
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:33,510
Hang on...

706
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:36,710
Hang on for just a little while.

707
01:04:37,909 --> 01:04:39,409
I will prove your innocence...

708
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:41,949
with my own two hands.

709
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,219
So that you will never again...

710
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:46,750
be criticized by others.

711
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:49,360
Father.

712
01:04:49,789 --> 01:04:50,960
Father.

713
01:05:02,269 --> 01:05:03,269
A foreign intruder.

714
01:05:03,769 --> 01:05:05,139
A foreign intruder is here.

715
01:05:05,469 --> 01:05:06,710
An intruder!

716
01:05:07,679 --> 01:05:09,440
- Master.
- A foreign intruder!

717
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:11,579
An intruder is here.

718
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:14,920
A foreign intruder...

719
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:17,079
Gil Chae.

720
01:05:18,349 --> 01:05:19,349
Gil Chae.

721
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:01,800
My dear.

722
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:08,099
May I take a few of these daggers,

723
01:06:08,869 --> 01:06:11,170
just in case?

724
01:06:12,409 --> 01:06:13,440
What...

725
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:15,679
do you mean by that?

726
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:24,690
Yes.

727
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,889
When I was in Simyang,
I was sold to a foreign intruder...

728
01:06:29,989 --> 01:06:32,289
and had to suffer utter humiliation.

729
01:06:37,829 --> 01:06:39,730
I also met Lord Lee Jang Hyun there.

730
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:43,039
I was released, thanks to his help.

731
01:06:47,539 --> 01:06:49,380
What the intruders did to me...

732
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:52,679
That was not my fault.

733
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:54,880
Had you wanted to divorce me
because of that,

734
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,980
I would not have backed down,
no matter what.

735
01:06:57,619 --> 01:06:58,690
However...

736
01:07:04,389 --> 01:07:06,989
In Simyang, I gave my heart to Lord Lee.

737
01:07:11,369 --> 01:07:12,400
For that, I am sorry.

738
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,010
That is why I am divorcing you.

739
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:35,190
Oh, boy.

740
01:08:01,949 --> 01:08:05,550
(My Dearest)

741
01:08:50,199 --> 01:08:52,899
Will His Highness the Crown Prince
return to Joseon?

742
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:55,340
Then Interpreter Lee
and Gu Jam will also...

743
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:56,739
Gu Jam.

744
01:08:57,140 --> 01:08:59,409
My lord, you are here.

745
01:09:00,039 --> 01:09:03,880
But I, too, had a place
I missed and wanted to return to.

746
01:09:04,149 --> 01:09:05,609
Now that Lady Yoo is divorced,

747
01:09:05,609 --> 01:09:07,050
will she come running to you?

748
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:08,119
I shall return.

749
01:09:08,119 --> 01:09:10,050
I wish to live for her from now on.

750
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:13,050
I had a bad craving
for those rice cakes with beans.

751
01:09:13,050 --> 01:09:14,619
What? Rice cakes with beans?

752
01:09:15,619 --> 01:09:18,659
Let us live like this
for a thousand years to come.

753
