1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,470
(This drama is a work of fiction
created based on historical facts.)

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:04,139
(Most of the details and depictions
of the characters are fictional.)

3
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,239
Have you lost it?

4
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:07,400
We could have taken the shortcut.

5
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,300
You know this route is full of bandits.

6
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,439
So why?

7
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,639
Jang Hyun.

8
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,639
Just forget about that Gil Chae already.

9
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,110
Look at me. I am completely fine.

10
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,050
Is Jong Jong the only one for me?

11
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,750
The world is full of girls like her.

12
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:37,729
Both...

13
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,000
my body and soul...

14
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:47,340
are yours.

15
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,639
Is there anything of yours
that belongs to me?

16
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,379
Well...

17
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:03,520
Is it this?

18
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,800
Or this?

19
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,099
Perhaps this.

20
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,969
And...

21
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,009
this.

22
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,509
(My Dearest)

23
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,810
(Episode 11)

24
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:12,860
Put it here.

25
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,229
I am starving.

26
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:15,330
My lady.

27
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,100
I mean, madam.

28
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,430
You may leave.

29
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,829
You too, Jong Jong.

30
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,370
How is she so unabashed for a new bride?

31
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:43,189
That should have been my job.

32
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,350
I shall be a good wife.

33
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,250
Please trust me.

34
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,930
My dear.

35
00:05:58,329 --> 00:05:59,959
Why do you look so perplexed?

36
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:20,120
Has Jang Hyun not returned?

37
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,790
Your Highness.

38
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,319
We have a lot to settle right now.

39
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,790
How can it be delayed?

40
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,560
Please get someone...

41
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,000
to call Lee Jang Hyun back.

42
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,230
He wants Lee Jang Hyun
to be summoned back.

43
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,269
Jang Hyun stayed in Joseon to get paper.

44
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:39,769
He has yet to write back.

45
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,439
I am waiting for him too.

46
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,519
Otter pelt, squirrel pelt,
and one sturdy horse.

47
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:54,050
Otter gallbladder, Japanese swords,
honey, red fox leather, and...

48
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:56,290
Once you leave,

49
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,360
when will I see you again?

50
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,389
I will make sure to return to Joseon...

51
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:03,899
and atone for being undutiful.

52
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:05,259
All right.

53
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,329
By the way,

54
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:11,839
I heard Yong Gol Dae suggested
that you wear a red dragon robe.

55
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,709
It is because
they are uneducated and thoughtless.

56
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,579
I told them...

57
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:20,850
that only Your Majesty can wear robes
with dragon embroidery.

58
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:24,319
And what did they say?

59
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,120
I think they understood.

60
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:28,050
Surprisingly, they seem to...

61
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,560
be pleased
when Joseon subjects show their loyalty...

62
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,819
and when women keep their chastity.

63
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,230
Even the Qing wanted
to learn from those values.

64
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,959
They were pleased?

65
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,569
When you sent in a mix of rice and millet,

66
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:44,300
they were also pleased, yes?

67
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,939
As they were pressuring us,

68
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:51,009
I told them that we could only
make the deadline with mixed grains...

69
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:52,439
and it appealed to them.

70
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:54,449
They were different...

71
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:57,779
from the rumors I heard within these walls
when I grew up here.

72
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,379
After meeting them in person,

73
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,389
they were more flexible than I thought.

74
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,189
So I...

75
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,860
Do you think that
since I sit in this palace,

76
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,259
I am blind and deaf to the outside world?

77
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,399
The Qing emperor sent me a private letter.

78
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:23,139
His ministers criticized me
for sending my adoptive son as hostage...

79
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:24,509
instead of my biological son.

80
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:28,350
Do you still think they are flexible?

81
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,720
Then tell me,
what have you accomplished...

82
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,990
in Simyang thus far?

83
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,769
Five du of yellow chestnuts,

84
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:48,970
three sheets of red cloth,

85
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,000
and brushes...

86
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,039
Your Highness.

87
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,549
Interpreter Lee Jang Hyun is back.

88
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:13,419
Your Highness,
please receive my greetings.

89
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,090
Have you been well?

90
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:19,899
Why are you so late?

91
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,470
Of course.

92
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,370
He would not just leave.

93
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,919
Did something happen in Joseon?

94
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:42,019
Why do you look like...

95
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:44,460
you just lost the woman you longed for?

96
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:47,059
This sly fellow...

97
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,259
Yes, I lost her.

98
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:55,330
This time,

99
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,139
I lost her for good.

100
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,809
So did I.

101
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:09,309
I lost my thing for good.

102
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:16,750
Even without them,

103
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:18,919
we will still live on.

104
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,990
There is nothing...

105
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,330
you cannot live without.

106
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,399
One way or another,

107
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,070
we will still live on.

108
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,529
It serves you right.

109
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,269
I knew a woman would stab you
in the heart someday.

110
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:07,509
It must have been nice when you toyed
with the ladies,

111
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:08,870
saying you were a misogamist.

112
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,940
This is why
you can never avoid retribution...

113
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:15,179
even if you try to hide...

114
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:20,350
in deep waters or high mountains.

115
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:24,360
You passed out after drinking.
Just stay in bed.

116
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:25,960
This is for the best.

117
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,690
Ryang Eum is not here either.

118
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,559
Let us stop doing that.

119
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,159
Gosh.

120
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:35,669
We need to go.

121
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,129
What?

122
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,070
Let us go.

123
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:44,610
Come on!

124
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,950
Ryang Eum is not even here.
Why are we doing this again?

125
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,889
You are talking about Ryang Eum again?

126
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,559
Do you miss him that much?

127
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:03,460
When did I ever say that?

128
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,759
Then send him a letter...

129
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,129
saying you miss him to death.

130
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,169
I said that is not it.

131
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:22,279
Do you follow me around?

132
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:25,320
She must be a woman.

133
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:28,250
As if.

134
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,190
Did you follow me here?

135
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,490
Let us see who captures more people.

136
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,629
Go away!

137
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,070
- No!
- No!

138
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,809
Come on.

139
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:13,230
Hey!

140
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,879
Catch them!

141
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,929
Get up.

142
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:44,259
Let us go.

143
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:51,970
Get close.

144
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:21,929
Yang Chun.

145
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,830
Yang Chun.

146
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,860
Are you...

147
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,360
capturing captives to sell them?

148
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:33,340
Ignore what you saw today.

149
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:37,539
Please.

150
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,429
Goodness. Yang Chun.

151
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,690
Okay. Here. Dig in.

152
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,529
Yes. Eat up.

153
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,590
Here.

154
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,960
What happened?

155
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,029
How in the world did you end up...

156
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,160
No, it is okay. Eat up.

157
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,930
You startled the kids.

158
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,140
If I were to get caught this time,

159
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,740
I knew I would die.

160
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,809
I cannot believe I ran into you guys.

161
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:26,720
In the end, I survived.

162
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:37,829
With the invasion of the intruders,

163
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,200
all the people of Uiju came to me to hide.

164
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,369
My reputation was on the line.

165
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,609
I could not ignore them.

166
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:28,849
They all died.

167
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,079
Ningguchin ran away.

168
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,089
But he probably died as well.

169
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,960
But...

170
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:44,529
how did you guys end up...

171
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,869
capturing captives to sell them?

172
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:49,970
What do you take us for?

173
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:58,740
Cut one heel each
and send it to their masters.

174
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,210
Yes, My lord.

175
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,420
Please spare us!

176
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,720
Please spare us!

177
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,190
Let me live!

178
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:15,630
Let me go!

179
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,029
Let me go!

180
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,400
Let me go!

181
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,769
If you cut off their heels,

182
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:24,869
their value will drop.

183
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,740
What a shame.

184
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,039
Let me go!

185
00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:29,569
Darn you all!

186
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,579
You could probably sell them for 30 nyang.

187
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:33,579
Those feeble people for 30 nyang?

188
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,410
I doubt it.

189
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,250
I think I would be able to.

190
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,450
Please, spare me.

191
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,650
If I cannot,

192
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,420
it will not be too late
to cut off their heels then.

193
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,950
Please, spare me.

194
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:44,960
Instead...

195
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:47,690
Spare me.

196
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,730
if I sell them for 30,

197
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,329
please give me three nyang.

198
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,799
I also need something to motivate me.

199
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:57,940
Stop.

200
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,640
If you deceive me,

201
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,950
I will cut off your heel.

202
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:34,970
Thank you for helping him.

203
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,309
I was not helping him.
I was just complying with your request.

204
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,480
But can we really sell all of them
for 30 nyang?

205
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,589
So what I am asking is,

206
00:20:49,589 --> 00:20:51,420
how are you going to sell all of them
for 30 nyang?

207
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,690
There are so many of them.

208
00:21:07,569 --> 00:21:10,369
This is just unbelievable.

209
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:14,009
We were going to pay for them?

210
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:18,579
Did you take me for a master of trading?

211
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,849
That lot...

212
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:28,829
How could we ever sell them for 30 nyang?

213
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,230
How?

214
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,470
No.

215
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,970
Once they gain some weight,

216
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,640
could we sell them for five nyang?

217
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:52,849
Hey.

218
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,630
Hey.

219
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,240
Did you really sell the fools
for 30 nyang?

220
00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:17,710
Yes.

221
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,779
I see.

222
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,710
What business acumen.

223
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,049
In that case...

224
00:22:25,349 --> 00:22:26,450
Send them in.

225
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,130
Can you sell them for me as well?

226
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,410
Come on. Run.

227
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,319
Please, spare me.

228
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:07,960
Let me live.

229
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,460
Come this way.

230
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,539
You can rest here.

231
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,900
It is safe.

232
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:25,309
That man there will protect us all.

233
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:28,650
Things are getting...

234
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,750
just worse...

235
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,079
and worse.

236
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:41,990
The children...

237
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:44,930
are worth half an adult, so 15 nyang.

238
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:49,170
There are 12,

239
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,529
so 180 nyang.

240
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:52,799
Yes.

241
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,569
That is 180 nyang.

242
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,579
It is best to let me capture you!

243
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,420
We are your best option,

244
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,480
my gosh.

245
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,460
Big sister!

246
00:24:13,589 --> 00:24:14,720
Jung In!

247
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,289
Jung In.

248
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,740
Do you not think
Ryang Eum is too emotional?

249
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:51,289
Did you not promise you would open...

250
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:52,900
another Usimjeong branch for me?

251
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,299
I promised.

252
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,230
If we keep spending at this rate, when...

253
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,369
Gu Jam.

254
00:25:02,069 --> 00:25:03,410
We have a visitor.

255
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,509
I will go and check.

256
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:15,549
I heard of you.

257
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:17,619
Send me to Joseon too.

258
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,720
I cannot if you kill me.

259
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,700
Please spare us.

260
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,569
We all die if you do not take us in.

261
00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:33,599
Please help us.

262
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:35,839
- I have three daughters.
- Help us.

263
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:37,410
Please spare us as well.

264
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:39,410
- Please.
- Help us.

265
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:41,750
- Spare us.
- Please help.

266
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:03,069
This is all Ryang Eum's fault.

267
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,039
You always give in to him.

268
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,039
But then, if he looks at you...

269
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:11,210
with eyes brimming,

270
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,980
you have no choice but to fold.

271
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,950
The darn fox.

272
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,579
Since we are together...

273
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:19,119
after a long while...

274
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:22,720
We should have some fun.

275
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:24,119
Have a drink.

276
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:27,819
We have gathered again,

277
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,529
so let us have fun like we did in Uiju.

278
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:35,670
I look like a right mess.

279
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,829
Yang Chun.

280
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:39,640
It is not like...

281
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,240
you did any physical labor.

282
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:44,740
All you have to do now...

283
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:47,579
is to tell others what to do.

284
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,650
Save up a fortune...

285
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,450
and Gu Jam, you...

286
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,049
open the Namwon branch of Usimjeong.

287
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,819
And in Uiju,

288
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:03,630
we shall build
an even bigger lodging facility.

289
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:09,269
My gosh.

290
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:11,869
Dear Jang Hyun is talking sense for once.

291
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:15,240
I thought you would die of love-sickness
after letting Lady Gil Chae go.

292
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:23,710
Hey.

293
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:26,549
I am Lee Jang Hyun.

294
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,519
Do you think...

295
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,319
I am...

296
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:31,990
a fool of a loser...

297
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:33,660
who would cry over a woman...

298
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:35,259
and lament my plight?

299
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,660
You know you are, then.

300
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,200
Very well, then. Tonight,

301
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,369
I will enjoy the company
of some Simyang women.

302
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,539
Come in.

303
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,500
The foreigner's shaved head
sparkled in the sun.

304
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,170
Come on.

305
00:28:17,369 --> 00:28:18,869
You have a long way to go...

306
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,839
with me tonight, so drink up.

307
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,539
What did she say?

308
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,579
She will show you a good time
all night long.

309
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:37,390
We shall go now.

310
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,390
What? Okay, then.

311
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:48,700
Sweet dreams.

312
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:50,299
Jong Jong.

313
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,400
Namwon's Usimjeong...

314
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,440
is mine now.

315
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,150
Shall I serve you tonight?

316
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,980
Sounds good.

317
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,589
Shall we switch rooms, then?

318
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,519
Sounds good.

319
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:19,200
Shall I just keep filling your cup?

320
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:25,900
Sounds good.

321
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,869
That would be good.

322
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:32,640
Very good.

323
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,049
Will you call me...

324
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,019
an ugly rock?

325
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:05,279
"Hey, you ugly rock."

326
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,109
Say it.

327
00:31:10,009 --> 00:31:11,039
Oh, no.

328
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:31,589
I went to Uiju.

329
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:34,930
But it was already...

330
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,569
after you had been taken away.

331
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:44,769
I was too late.

332
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:46,579
It is fine.

333
00:31:50,349 --> 00:31:51,579
Did you have a woman?

334
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,019
Is she pretty?

335
00:31:57,849 --> 00:31:59,190
Pretty? As if.

336
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:01,990
If the woman is not even pretty,

337
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:04,359
why are you making such a fuss?

338
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,400
Just because.

339
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:14,500
She is a cool person.

340
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:17,369
Like you.

341
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:24,109
Thank you...

342
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:29,319
for being alive.

343
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:37,690
You must have...

344
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,000
wronged me quite a lot in our past lives.

345
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:49,039
That must be why you are my savior
in this life.

346
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,309
Is that not right?

347
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:33,380
It looks as if flowers will bloom.

348
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,589
There is...

349
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,500
another woman you like besides me,
is there not?

350
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:48,630
I already know.

351
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,240
Still, today...

352
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:08,340
Is there something you like?

353
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:11,510
I am not sure.

354
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,320
But how did a woman of noble birth...

355
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,889
end up selling things?

356
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,239
You look happy.
You must have earned a lot of money.

357
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,539
You see, someone from the palace...

358
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:40,179
came looking for our daggers.

359
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,380
From the palace? Who?

360
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:43,880
Royal Concubine Cho.

361
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,320
She asked me
how I ended up selling things,

362
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,619
so I told her everything
that happened until now.

363
00:35:56,829 --> 00:35:57,889
It is strange.

364
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,929
In Hanyang, the place you have left,

365
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:05,469
the closest I can get to you
is that woman.

366
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,309
So if I do not see that woman
every day at least,

367
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,280
I cannot bear it. This is...

368
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,110
so strange.

369
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:25,050
You dare...

370
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:27,219
to flirt with His Majesty?

371
00:36:28,289 --> 00:36:29,289
(Wangya:
A way to address the king with respect)

372
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:30,889
Wake up.

373
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:54,519
No.

374
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,860
No!

375
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:04,389
No!

376
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,260
Please spare me!

377
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:09,900
His Majesty wants high-quality tiger skin.

378
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,500
Tiger skin is hard to come by.

379
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,500
I do not have anyone else to ask but you.

380
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,909
Please spare me!

381
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,880
No!

382
00:37:21,179 --> 00:37:22,239
Again?

383
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,650
It is awful how jealous she is.

384
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:25,679
Please!

385
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,219
What is going on?

386
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,190
Hey.

387
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:31,820
You may not look in the garden carelessly.

388
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:38,730
Please do me this favor.

389
00:38:07,489 --> 00:38:09,360
No! Please!

390
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:22,039
No!

391
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:30,980
Please!

392
00:38:35,789 --> 00:38:36,789
Please spare me!

393
00:38:45,929 --> 00:38:47,599
- Be quiet!
- Let us get some sleep.

394
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:48,599
What is all the fuss about?

395
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:53,599
I will go and get a new towel.

396
00:38:57,739 --> 00:38:59,039
Do not leave.

397
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,150
I will be back soon.

398
00:39:44,489 --> 00:39:45,860
You saw Young Rang?

399
00:39:48,989 --> 00:39:50,829
- That is why...
- What?

400
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,300
I cannot. No.

401
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:58,730
We may have saved captives
who had escaped,

402
00:39:58,969 --> 00:40:00,440
but busting people out of the palace?

403
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,469
Do not even dream of it.

404
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:05,440
Fine.

405
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,280
You can sit out if you want.

406
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,909
Gu Jam is right.

407
00:40:14,219 --> 00:40:16,849
Those women were already soiled
by the intruders.

408
00:40:17,789 --> 00:40:19,719
No one will treat them
with respect in Joseon.

409
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:21,519
Why should we risk our lives for them?

410
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:23,760
Stop this nonsense.

411
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,699
Why are you not eating?

412
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,639
Is the porridge bad?

413
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,610
Have a bite.

414
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:39,039
Just try it.

415
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:42,280
Goodness, you have a good life.

416
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,050
All you do is cry...

417
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,219
Can you...

418
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,119
pass me the baby?

419
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:55,559
No way.

420
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,429
How dare an intruder's woman...

421
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,300
Come on.

422
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,710
There, there.

423
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,380
Stop crying.

424
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:16,980
He is sleeping.

425
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:19,050
He is asleep.

426
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,380
Goodness. I hope you stay asleep.

427
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:25,389
You are here.

428
00:41:54,019 --> 00:41:55,280
Kkeut Soe and I...

429
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,690
were captured together.

430
00:41:58,619 --> 00:41:59,760
As you know,

431
00:42:00,489 --> 00:42:03,190
Kkeut Soe used to carry nets...

432
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,929
so he had a strong build.

433
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:07,360
But he was caught when he ran away,

434
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:09,670
and recaptured when he escaped again.

435
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:12,539
At first, they pierced his ears.

436
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:14,769
Then, they slashed his heel.

437
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:17,440
During his last recapture,

438
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:21,309
his former build had shrunk...

439
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,309
and he became...

440
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,079
a skeleton whose pupils quivered.

441
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:32,019
I know...

442
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,760
I did a lot of evil deeds...

443
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:40,159
and met all kinds of scoundrels.

444
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,900
But the intruders are different.

445
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,809
My jaw is shaking.

446
00:42:57,079 --> 00:42:58,150
So do not...

447
00:42:58,349 --> 00:43:00,519
try and save those women...

448
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,349
while cutting your life short in return.

449
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:05,449
You hear me?

450
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:06,559
Whatever.

451
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,889
I will get Young Rang out
if she wants to escape.

452
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:12,030
What?

453
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:18,300
It is Young Rang, after all.

454
00:43:22,909 --> 00:43:24,409
(Prince Yoon Chin)

455
00:43:24,409 --> 00:43:26,440
Thanks a lot!

456
00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:31,449
Perhaps,

457
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,079
would you consider
selling your Joseon hostages?

458
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:37,789
I will...

459
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:41,989
make sure to fetch you
a good price for them.

460
00:43:55,769 --> 00:43:57,710
All the Joseon slaves...

461
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:01,139
are women who will attend
to His Highness in bed.

462
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,610
He refuses to release them for money.

463
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:08,579
(Sokhwan: to release captives
in return for money)

464
00:44:23,429 --> 00:44:24,900
Bright and starry Young Rang.

465
00:44:27,869 --> 00:44:30,570
Jang Hyun?

466
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,710
Do you want to leave this place?

467
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,579
I will help you if you wish.

468
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:45,949
As usual, he never listens.

469
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:49,219
Slave hunters are often seen here.

470
00:44:50,329 --> 00:44:51,630
You must be careful.

471
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:53,230
Understood?

472
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:55,559
Please send me back to Joseon.

473
00:44:56,429 --> 00:44:58,170
My wife is waiting for me.

474
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:08,179
He will bring you along too.

475
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:15,739
How tiring.

476
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,909
I am exhausted.

477
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,980
Hurry up, Hang Yi.

478
00:46:48,179 --> 00:46:49,309
I do not think...

479
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:53,019
I can leave.

480
00:46:54,449 --> 00:46:55,550
They threatened...

481
00:46:56,789 --> 00:46:58,849
to chop off my hand next.

482
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:31,849
Joseon paper...

483
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,389
is very popular.

484
00:47:33,789 --> 00:47:34,860
I am counting on you.

485
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:53,409
I am on my way to sell paper from Joseon.

486
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:02,650
Halt there!

487
00:48:43,659 --> 00:48:44,829
I will lure them away.

488
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,030
A captive!

489
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:08,809
Go.

490
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:10,280
Yes, sir.

491
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:35,800
Why are you here?

492
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,530
You made it.

493
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:13,030
Goodness. Jang Hyun, you are amazing!

494
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:22,780
Gosh. What is taking them so long?

495
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:30,050
- Yang Chun.
- We better hurry.

496
00:52:41,929 --> 00:52:42,960
Jang Hyun.

497
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:48,969
If they find out you ran away,

498
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:51,869
they will do everything
in their power to find you.

499
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:56,039
That is why you must cross
this river today.

500
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,909
Brace yourself.

501
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:06,119
Jang Hyun,

502
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,559
did you fix your disease down there?

503
00:53:10,789 --> 00:53:11,789
What?

504
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,659
You do not like me anymore,

505
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:16,670
do you?

506
00:53:18,869 --> 00:53:20,869
You probably will not like a girl
whose body is trash.

507
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:24,309
What do you mean?

508
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:26,170
You already know.

509
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:28,840
An intruder took advantage of me.

510
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:31,750
Are you going to say your body is trash
if you get bitten by a dog?

511
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:36,889
If a lunatic punches you,

512
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,789
will that spot become dirty?

513
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:44,389
A man in his right mind...

514
00:53:44,389 --> 00:53:47,030
will not think such an incident
makes you trash.

515
00:53:48,429 --> 00:53:49,460
So...

516
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:51,300
when you go back to Joseon,

517
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:54,869
think of meeting a normal man like that,

518
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:58,269
not a eunuch like me.

519
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:02,039
Jang Hyun.

520
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:06,719
Yang Chun risked his life...

521
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,349
to send you to Joseon.

522
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:15,460
Remember his efforts...

523
00:54:17,429 --> 00:54:18,929
and live a good life.

524
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:23,199
I will.

525
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:37,610
We are ready.

526
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:41,449
Young Rang, go.

527
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:10,309
Please,

528
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,750
stay safe.

529
00:55:20,219 --> 00:55:21,690
The envoy that came this time...

530
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:23,320
(Envoy: a messenger who carried
royal letters from the Ming or the Qing)

531
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,289
told the eunuchs something.

532
00:55:26,829 --> 00:55:28,260
What might that be, Your Majesty?

533
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:34,139
Since our country has not been capturing
a lot of captives and sending them back,

534
00:55:34,139 --> 00:55:35,440
(Soehan: sending fugitive slaves
back to their owners)

535
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,210
he said I must go
to the emperor of Simyang myself...

536
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:40,179
to inform him of this fact.

537
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,349
They are trying to make me
go to the Qing...

538
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:46,880
for not being able...

539
00:55:47,579 --> 00:55:49,619
to capture the escapees.

540
00:55:50,019 --> 00:55:53,190
They are using that as an excuse...

541
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:55,320
to come up with a wicked plan.

542
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:58,889
They are certainly trying
to make our country fall again!

543
00:55:58,889 --> 00:56:00,429
- That is right.
- That is right.

544
00:56:00,929 --> 00:56:02,730
Do not jump to conclusions!

545
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:06,099
If any of this is leaked,
the people will be shaken,

546
00:56:06,469 --> 00:56:08,340
so we must keep our mouths shut.

547
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,139
It is quite strange.

548
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:15,179
The Crown Prince is bowing and scraping...

549
00:56:15,179 --> 00:56:17,010
to Khan by learning the Manchu alphabet.

550
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:22,250
But why is the Qing still
so caught up in capturing the escapees?

551
00:56:23,949 --> 00:56:27,090
Does the Crown Prince not know
how plagued...

552
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:29,719
I have been in regard to the escapees?

553
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:32,559
Is the Crown Prince...

554
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:35,429
just trying not to upset them...

555
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:38,429
in order to protect himself?

556
00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:43,139
Your Majesty.

557
00:56:43,969 --> 00:56:46,809
For now, you must respond
to their request...

558
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:49,039
and calm them down.

559
00:56:50,179 --> 00:56:51,210
You are right.

560
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:56,849
It is such a shame that we must...

561
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:59,449
send the escapees back,

562
00:57:00,659 --> 00:57:02,420
but it cannot be helped.

563
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:06,360
Quickly capture those
who have successfully escaped.

564
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,400
(Joohoiin: those who escaped
from being held captive)

565
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,059
Send them back along with the envoy.

566
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:14,739
(Escapees, turn yourself in.)

567
00:57:14,739 --> 00:57:16,400
Escapees, turn yourself in.

568
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:18,539
Those who do not...

569
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,440
and those who help the escapees hide...

570
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,809
will be punished equally.

571
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:26,980
Those who report these people
will be rewarded greatly.

572
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:27,980
Wait.

573
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:31,050
Will we really be rewarded...

574
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:32,489
for reporting escapees?

575
00:57:32,489 --> 00:57:34,820
Gosh. They risked their lives to run away.

576
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:36,559
Do you really want to rat on them
for a few pennies?

577
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:38,489
Who said I would?

578
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:40,360
I was just curious.

579
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:43,360
The whole nation
is trembling once again...

580
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:46,269
due to this incident.

581
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:50,570
I know my people
risked their lives to escape.

582
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:55,440
But who knew the Namhan Fortress treaty
would be this strict?

583
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,440
No!

584
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,610
Since they tie up the escapees...

585
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:00,079
and treat them like thieves,

586
00:58:00,619 --> 00:58:02,550
some have hanged themselves to death,

587
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:04,719
and others have even
cut off their hands and feet...

588
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:06,619
to hold off their farewells.

589
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:10,230
Some officials have even felt pressed...

590
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:12,030
to falsely capture their relatives.

591
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,130
- Yes!
- Yes!

592
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:15,659
But the royal court cannot judge
each and every person,

593
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:19,000
so many are being dragged away
with much resentment.

594
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,070
I did not escape!

595
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,909
Even if the people who suffer
from this matter...

596
00:58:25,369 --> 00:58:28,210
are to rebuke and resent me,

597
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:31,780
I am at fault,
so there is nothing I can do.

598
00:58:33,179 --> 00:58:34,179
But...

599
00:58:34,579 --> 00:58:36,420
please understand my intentions.

600
00:58:36,989 --> 00:58:38,989
Do not think of dispersing...

601
00:58:38,989 --> 00:58:40,389
or disobeying my orders.

602
00:58:40,989 --> 00:58:43,159
May our 200-year state...

603
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:46,460
remain in existence.

604
00:58:47,659 --> 00:58:49,530
That is my wish.

605
00:58:52,869 --> 00:58:55,400
Goodness. Do not go.

606
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,969
I might be late today...

607
00:58:58,070 --> 00:58:59,239
drinking with my superiors.

608
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,539
No.

609
00:59:01,539 --> 00:59:03,610
Shall I come home early to be with you?

610
00:59:04,809 --> 00:59:06,449
Why would you say that?

611
00:59:07,449 --> 00:59:09,579
You must appease your superiors...

612
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:11,789
so you can become even more successful.

613
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,260
What if I get promoted?

614
00:59:16,059 --> 00:59:17,389
You will become richer.

615
00:59:17,789 --> 00:59:18,960
And if I become richer?

616
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:21,360
It is good to be rich.

617
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:26,329
I will do my best
to appease your superiors' wives.

618
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:30,139
So do not sit all quiet and gruff.

619
00:59:30,139 --> 00:59:31,570
Have fun while you are there.

620
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:32,940
Okay?

621
00:59:33,239 --> 00:59:34,280
Okay.

622
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:37,579
To be rich. That would be nice.

623
00:59:39,349 --> 00:59:40,420
See you later.

624
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,199
We are threatened...

625
01:00:02,539 --> 01:00:04,739
to return the captives,
so we have no choice,

626
01:00:05,269 --> 01:00:07,139
but please let their parents, wives,

627
01:00:07,139 --> 01:00:09,739
and children go free
and take pity on them.

628
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:11,510
Show them your grace.

629
01:00:12,179 --> 01:00:15,449
If the government
were to pay for their return,

630
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,550
the people would not blame you...

631
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:19,250
if you were to charge them later.

632
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,860
Spy on Jung Myung Soo,

633
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:23,690
find out how much he wants,

634
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:25,590
and help our people return home.

635
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,110
My darling.

636
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:42,440
Why did you not interrupt me?

637
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:46,550
I dare not disturb you
as you write an appeal.

638
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:50,079
What are you appealing about?

639
01:00:51,789 --> 01:00:53,860
They are capturing the captives
that got away.

640
01:00:55,559 --> 01:00:57,860
Do you know
what the foreign intruders want?

641
01:00:58,860 --> 01:00:59,960
They are...

642
01:01:01,059 --> 01:01:03,630
trying to get Joseon people to fight...

643
01:01:03,969 --> 01:01:05,599
and hate each other.

644
01:01:06,699 --> 01:01:08,139
And yet many in court...

645
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:11,369
want to side with them
and plan our future.

646
01:01:14,909 --> 01:01:16,510
Now no one...

647
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:19,510
cares about my appeals...

648
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:20,920
and wants to read them.

649
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:22,849
Other than you,

650
01:01:22,849 --> 01:01:25,920
who would have the courage
to appeal to the King that he stop...

651
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,860
recapturing the captives?

652
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:31,690
I am helping Gil Chae.

653
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,130
So you should...

654
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,429
do what you see fit.

655
01:01:42,369 --> 01:01:44,940
When I see how much you care about...

656
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:46,710
and do for our country,

657
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:49,280
I feel pleased and proud.

658
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:57,690
- Come on, Grandfather.
- Stop it.

659
01:01:57,690 --> 01:01:59,320
Go and play elsewhere.

660
01:02:01,159 --> 01:02:02,360
Go and play...

661
01:02:03,829 --> 01:02:04,960
My goodness.

662
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:27,719
Take in the captive!

663
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:28,750
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

664
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:32,219
What... I did nothing.

665
01:02:32,219 --> 01:02:34,690
- I am not a captive.
- Grandfather!

666
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,389
My lady!

667
01:02:37,389 --> 01:02:38,559
What are you doing?

668
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,400
Take him!

669
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:47,340
- Spare me.
- Grandfather.

670
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:49,900
My lady!

671
01:02:49,969 --> 01:02:51,639
- Please help!
- The poor man.

672
01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:53,980
I am not on the run!

673
01:02:55,179 --> 01:02:56,210
My lady.

674
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:58,809
Did you hide him
knowing he was a captive on the run?

675
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:00,409
I did not hide him.

676
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:02,619
I had no idea he was a fleeing captive.

677
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,550
If it is revealed...

678
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:06,920
you hid someone you should not,

679
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:10,190
you will pay dearly.

680
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:13,829
Do you know...

681
01:03:13,829 --> 01:03:16,699
who my husband is
that you take that tone with me?

682
01:03:24,139 --> 01:03:26,369
I am innocent, so I shall leave.

683
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:29,710
Oh, dear.

684
01:03:31,179 --> 01:03:33,349
- My word.
- I am so scared.

685
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:37,949
My lady.

686
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:40,090
Please help me.

687
01:03:40,659 --> 01:03:43,219
I will die if I am dragged back there.

688
01:03:44,429 --> 01:03:46,630
You want me to help you
when you deceived me?

689
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:50,130
Do you know what you put me through?

690
01:03:50,199 --> 01:03:52,000
I do not care if I die,

691
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,900
but I want my grandson to be spared.

692
01:03:58,309 --> 01:04:00,139
You knew!

693
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:03,809
You took us in knowing
we had escaped from the Qing!

694
01:04:03,909 --> 01:04:05,150
Shut your mouth.

695
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:08,449
How would I know when you deceived me?

696
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:11,989
This was your plan
from the start, was it not?

697
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:17,019
They will kill me if I return.

698
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:23,230
His Majesty insists I recapture
the Joseon girl that got away,

699
01:04:24,099 --> 01:04:26,469
but how am I to do something
the Joseon king cannot?

700
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:28,570
Exactly.

701
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,469
"Exactly?"

702
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:36,110
You will pay yourself
if we do not recapture the captives.

703
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:37,849
Come on.

704
01:04:38,409 --> 01:04:39,949
Can you not be more flexible?

705
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:44,219
Do you think...

706
01:04:44,849 --> 01:04:47,659
the servants are recapturing
the actual captives that got away?

707
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,829
What, then?

708
01:04:53,659 --> 01:04:55,400
The woman you just saw.

709
01:04:56,199 --> 01:04:57,670
Was she not beautiful?

710
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,500
If I were to serve up such a woman,

711
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:05,409
I would not have to worry
about the captives.

712
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:08,809
There is a way.

713
01:05:19,789 --> 01:05:20,989
If we return to Qing,

714
01:05:20,989 --> 01:05:23,019
my grandson Da Jim will die.

715
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:27,329
Why should I care?

716
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,340
Can you not release the children?

717
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:44,050
They will only drain your supplies.

718
01:06:00,159 --> 01:06:02,460
If a child or two were to die on the road,

719
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,300
no one would care.

720
01:06:22,579 --> 01:06:23,980
That man looks similar.

721
01:06:25,849 --> 01:06:27,019
Yes, sir.

722
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:28,920
- Bring him.
- Yes, sir.

723
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:35,900
I know, right?

724
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:37,969
I forgot something.

725
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:39,829
- Wait here.
- Go ahead.

726
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,289
Why did you bring him?
Who will take care of him?

727
01:07:02,090 --> 01:07:03,219
Stop crying.

728
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,489
Your grandfather will not come back.

729
01:07:08,599 --> 01:07:09,929
You are alone now.

730
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:12,570
You must be strong. Do you understand?

731
01:07:14,769 --> 01:07:15,940
Come along.

732
01:07:22,579 --> 01:07:24,250
Grandfather.

733
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:27,650
Grandfather.

734
01:07:30,449 --> 01:07:32,650
Grandfather.

735
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:35,659
My lady!

736
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:50,699
Eat all you want.

737
01:07:52,139 --> 01:07:55,510
You and I must keep each other company...

738
01:07:56,139 --> 01:07:58,579
until our hair turns white.

739
01:07:59,449 --> 01:08:01,119
Why are you being so gross?

740
01:08:03,219 --> 01:08:04,519
Have you heard?

741
01:08:05,150 --> 01:08:08,860
Joseon is in uproar because they are
recapturing captives that escaped.

742
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:12,260
They will be sent back to Simyang.

743
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:18,170
Hey.

744
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,369
Stuff your face in silence.

745
01:08:25,939 --> 01:08:27,010
Yang Chun.

746
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:30,640
That will never happen to you.

747
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:34,010
Trust me.

748
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:55,369
She is not in town.

749
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:02,739
What do you mean Gil Chae disappeared?

750
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:05,810
I am sure she left the forge
this afternoon.

751
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:07,819
But she did not return.

752
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:10,119
Gil Chae...

753
01:09:11,289 --> 01:09:12,489
I will look for her too.

754
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,050
- Let us go.
- Yes, Young Master.

755
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:15,460
Come on.

756
01:09:18,829 --> 01:09:20,789
Did she not say
she was going to stop by somewhere?

757
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:24,100
And Jong Jong?

758
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:25,800
Did Jong Jong disappear as well?

759
01:09:30,569 --> 01:09:31,569
Madam!

760
01:09:36,579 --> 01:09:37,579
My dear!

761
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:38,810
Madam!

762
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:40,250
Madam!

763
01:09:41,149 --> 01:09:42,149
Madam!

764
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:43,779
Madam!

765
01:09:47,819 --> 01:09:49,920
Madam!

766
01:09:58,199 --> 01:09:59,199
Madam...

767
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:01,470
Hurry up!

768
01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:04,170
Madam.

769
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:05,710
Go on!

770
01:10:11,479 --> 01:10:12,810
What on earth is going on?

771
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,449
You do not think
she and Young Master Jang Hyun...

772
01:10:16,449 --> 01:10:17,550
Shut your mouth.

773
01:10:18,989 --> 01:10:20,319
I was just wondering.

774
01:10:41,539 --> 01:10:42,909
Hey. What happened?

775
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:44,880
Gosh.

776
01:10:45,050 --> 01:10:46,680
Go and tell the master.

777
01:10:48,819 --> 01:10:50,420
Move aside.
Why are you getting in the way?

778
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:19,880
Madam.

779
01:11:20,079 --> 01:11:21,949
Please open your eyes, Madam.

780
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:35,199
Hurry up!

781
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,000
What on earth is going on?

782
01:11:45,470 --> 01:11:46,510
What is this?

783
01:11:47,979 --> 01:11:49,409
Where on earth are we?

784
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:53,710
Madam.

785
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:56,250
Please look after yourself.

786
01:11:56,550 --> 01:11:57,579
Go to the back!

787
01:12:08,529 --> 01:12:12,229
Madam, you once ran away from being taken
as a captive of the Qing army, right?

788
01:12:12,569 --> 01:12:14,399
That is why they are taking you back.

789
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:16,199
What?

790
01:12:17,069 --> 01:12:18,569
I was never taken as a captive.

791
01:12:18,869 --> 01:12:21,010
So let me go this instant!

792
01:12:31,619 --> 01:12:33,449
If you try to leave now,
you will end up like that.

793
01:12:35,289 --> 01:12:36,420
Do you want to leave?

794
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:42,600
The envoy who is returning soon...

795
01:12:43,399 --> 01:12:44,829
will be bringing runaways
captured in Joseon...

796
01:12:44,829 --> 01:12:46,229
and naturalized people.

797
01:12:46,229 --> 01:12:47,600
(Hyanghwain: Those who have gained
citizenship of another country)

798
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:48,970
This time, His Majesty...

799
01:12:49,569 --> 01:12:52,840
has ordered you to watch
the Joseon officials punish...

800
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:54,909
the runaway captives of war from Joseon.

801
01:13:12,489 --> 01:13:13,630
You heard, did you not?

802
01:13:14,029 --> 01:13:15,800
The captives will be coming
from Joseon this time.

803
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:19,000
But there is a court official
who says he cannot bear to watch...

804
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,069
the captives being punished.

805
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:24,609
Yes, I will take his place instead.

806
01:13:25,369 --> 01:13:26,470
Will you do that?

807
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:31,880
What is so hard about that?

808
01:13:32,779 --> 01:13:34,079
It is not like the captives...

809
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:37,250
will not be punished if I do not watch.

810
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:38,289
That is...

811
01:13:42,119 --> 01:13:44,020
I just cannot understand
what kind of man you are.

812
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:47,130
I will get going.

813
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:14,090
Madam.

814
01:14:19,859 --> 01:14:21,060
There they come.

815
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:24,529
Goodness.

816
01:14:26,569 --> 01:14:27,569
My gosh.

817
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:28,930
(My Dearest)

818
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:14,439
Please help me.

819
01:16:14,439 --> 01:16:15,739
We can save them.

820
01:16:15,739 --> 01:16:17,340
What do you mean, save them?

821
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:18,550
It is no use.

822
01:16:18,550 --> 01:16:20,609
Your lady has been chosen by His Majesty.

823
01:16:20,779 --> 01:16:22,649
I will go with Ryang Eum.

824
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:23,949
Give up.

825
01:16:23,949 --> 01:16:25,050
If you do not listen,

826
01:16:25,050 --> 01:16:27,590
they cut off your fingers or toes.

827
01:16:27,689 --> 01:16:29,359
Do you know Interpreter Lee?

828
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:31,890
I will kill you today for sure.

829
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:33,229
If you think so,

830
01:16:33,229 --> 01:16:35,260
go ahead and cut me right here.

831
01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:37,359
Your husband will come and get you?

832
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:40,369
No husband has ever come to find his wife.

833
01:16:41,369 --> 01:16:42,569
Do not forget.

834
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:44,939
Endure it until the end.

835
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:48,609
It is up to me to protect her.
