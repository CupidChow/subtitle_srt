(This drama is a work of fiction
created based on historical facts.)

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,980
(Most of the details and depictions
of the characters are fictional.)

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,950
(Final Episode)

4
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:27,969
You understand everything I say.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,100
You are...

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,840
not insane.

7
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,710
Is that not right?

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,210
Can you tell me...

9
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,750
about Lee Jang Hyun?

10
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:00,469
I was never insane.

11
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,840
You people...

12
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:11,340
just wanted to believe that what I said
was the words of a madman.

13
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,459
I will tell you about Lee Jang Hyun.

14
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,390
Then,

15
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,439
will you be able to tell me...

16
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,370
what happened to Lee Jang Hyun?

17
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,620
My life...

18
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,260
is full of regretful things.

19
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,290
Why do you think so?

20
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,840
I am not sure if what I did...

21
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,669
for the Crown Prince...

22
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,340
was helpful to His Highness.

23
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,039
If...

24
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,210
His Highness...

25
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,490
suffered at the hands
of the foreign intruders,

26
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:32,189
he would not have lost the favor
of His Majesty in Joseon.

27
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:35,129
Then...

28
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:36,389
My lord,

29
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,729
you protected His Highness.

30
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:47,969
So, now...

31
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,110
Let us only think
about enjoying our life together.

32
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,310
Okay?

33
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,250
Shall we?

34
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,150
Very well.

35
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:02,919
Then how do you wish to live
your life from now on, Gil Chae?

36
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,500
I wish to...

37
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:19,300
(My Dearest)

38
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,370
What?

39
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,610
The Crown Prince was killed by poisoning?

40
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:26,580
Who is spreading such rumors?

41
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,680
You should have done a better job
serving His Majesty.

42
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,550
What have you been doing
until such rumors spread?

43
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,159
Your Majesty.

44
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,060
I am certain that those mourning
Thief Kang's death spread such rumors.

45
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,360
(Thief Kang: Crown Princess Kang)

46
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,969
What are you waiting for?
Arrest them at once!

47
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:47,969
However,

48
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,099
we cannot arrest anyone without evidence.

49
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,740
We cannot let the rumors snowball.

50
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:01,050
Your Majesty.

51
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,280
With Jin Saeng's report alone,

52
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,379
the Crown Princess was convicted
of treason.

53
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,020
It has outraged the Confucian scholars.

54
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,020
Right, which is why...

55
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:11,960
someone they trust and look up to
should step in.

56
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,089
Kim Jib, Kim Sang Heon,
or Jang Chul, for example.

57
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,569
Yes, Jang Chul.

58
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,129
Summon Jang Chul.

59
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,139
However,
Jang Chul deeply pities the captives.

60
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,040
We must make him do it.

61
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,810
I will make him do it.

62
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,490
Arrest the rebels.

63
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,860
The rebels who were scheming
with Thief Kang are now plotting treason.

64
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,959
I wish to put you in charge of finding
and rounding them up.

65
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,699
Your Majesty.

66
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,529
You should take pity on the captives.

67
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,339
How could you call them "rebels?"

68
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,910
I am sure of it.

69
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,509
All the wealth that traitor Lady Kang
had accumulated was gone.

70
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,810
We could not find anything
but some useless fabrics.

71
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,779
So, where did all the wealth go?

72
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:13,620
I am certain...

73
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,189
that it all went to the captives.

74
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,759
Is there evidence?

75
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:23,699
Evidence, you say?

76
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,870
Then how about this?

77
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,269
Every year,

78
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:33,939
I receive an appeal from someone
asking to restore the name...

79
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:35,470
of their family that was destroyed
in the Year of Gichuk.

80
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,410
Every man in the family died.

81
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,949
A married daughter is
the only one who survived,

82
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,779
and she has been submitting
an appeal every year.

83
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,350
I have been ignoring her appeals so far,

84
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,920
but I may now open the appeals...

85
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,930
and reinvestigate the truth behind
the treacherous conspiracy...

86
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,970
that your father had reported.

87
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,139
Father.

88
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,750
I have never once asked you,

89
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:18,579
but please tell me now.

90
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,720
Father.

91
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:25,620
You heard firsthand about the rebels...

92
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,990
plotting treason together, right?

93
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:33,529
Your report was truthful, was it not?

94
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,790
I can accuse your late father
of making a false report...

95
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,689
and kill him once again,

96
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,089
then make you...

97
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:05,399
become a lowly servant again.

98
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:10,329
In front of your disciples.

99
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,970
Do you wish for them to see you
become a servant again?

100
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,009
Your Majesty...

101
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:31,860
Master, I do not understand.

102
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,089
You sternly declined
when His Majesty was seeking your advice.

103
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:38,860
You are now in charge of finding rebels
among the returned captives?

104
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,870
I heard
you and Interpreter Lee Jang Hyun...

105
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,500
had known each other for a long time.

106
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:49,170
I heard you two went
to Namhan Fortress together.

107
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:52,009
Is that true?

108
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:53,910
Yes.

109
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,180
We do know each other,

110
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,420
but I do not know much about him.

111
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,790
I heard he bought an appointment letter
to gain a noble title.

112
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,589
I heard he traveled across the country
selling persimmons and paper...

113
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:06,120
and became very wealthy.

114
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:10,089
He bought an appointment letter
and became a nobleman?

115
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,970
So, he had a lowly birth?

116
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,540
I do not know anything about his past.

117
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,670
However,

118
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,470
he may be blinded by wealth,

119
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,810
but he would never plot treason.

120
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:31,620
First, look into this man, Lee Jang Hyun.

121
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,990
Interpreters freely interact
with the people of Qing,

122
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,360
so I cannot help but suspect him.

123
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,730
If he truly is scheming with Qing...

124
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,600
and tries to threaten
the safety of our nation,

125
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:48,529
I will be sure to get rid of him.

126
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,539
But if he is a mere merchant,

127
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:55,370
I will stop them from punishing him...

128
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:57,710
for treason.

129
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,710
Yes. Well understood, Master.

130
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:20,330
"Public slave
at the Eunsan Government Office,"

131
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:22,169
"Hyun."

132
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,370
Lee Jang Hyun was a public slave
at the Eunsan Government Office.

133
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:57,700
What about his parents?

134
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,070
They took in a vagabond
and turned him into a slave.

135
00:10:04,009 --> 00:10:06,139
I could not find anything
about his parents.

136
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,309
Well understood.

137
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:12,220
Master.

138
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,919
I do not mean to pry,

139
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,220
but may I ask how your son...

140
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,389
passed away?

141
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,740
He was attacked by a mob of bandits.

142
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,250
When we found him,

143
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,379
his body had been burned,

144
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,019
so I could not even recognize him.

145
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,190
That is how I lost my son,

146
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,929
but I think of all of you as my sons.

147
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,470
Especially you.

148
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,299
Always asking questions
and interrogating me.

149
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:12,840
You are always worried about me.

150
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,419
When I see that, I feel as though
I am looking at my own son.

151
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:27,360
In front of your disciples.

152
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,029
Do you wish for them to see you
become a servant again?

153
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,370
I cannot lose you lads too.

154
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,039
I absolutely cannot let that happen.

155
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:21,649
(In the Shadow of Love)

156
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:30,649
Hyun.

157
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,659
My son.

158
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,679
(The Joy of Spring)

159
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,220
(Ryang Eum)

160
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:44,129
(Lee Dan, Hyun)

161
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,500
What brings you here?

162
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:00,809
So you are leaving?

163
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,220
I do not have a father.

164
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:14,090
That is why I considered my master
to be my father.

165
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:18,830
Now and when I was in Neunggun-ri.

166
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:25,700
Well,

167
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,470
they say the king, teachers,
and parents are like one.

168
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:34,139
Just as you risked your life
in Namhan Fortress to serve the King,

169
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:37,409
you should consider
your master your father...

170
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,389
and do your best to serve him as well.

171
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,759
There is something I would like to know.

172
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,529
According to the rumors,

173
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:59,799
you bought yourself a title
to become an aristocrat.

174
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,940
That is true. I used to be a slave.

175
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,009
What is wrong?

176
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,379
Are you disappointed
that you have been treating a slave well?

177
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,620
Then what was your original name?

178
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,419
If you were a slave,
you probably did not have a surname.

179
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:19,389
But when you could come up with your name,

180
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,960
why did you make your last name Lee?

181
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,600
Why was it Lee?

182
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,340
In this country of Joseon, founded by Lee,

183
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:40,210
I wanted to live...

184
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,279
as a man with the surname of Lee.

185
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,600
I did not...

186
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,629
dislike you either.

187
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,769
You were no fun,

188
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,279
but I know you are not a bad person.

189
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,450
Now, this shabby fellow
will be gone from your sight forever,

190
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,320
so do not worry.

191
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,470
Your Majesty,

192
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:44,710
we have received a report
of people in Uiju...

193
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,210
holding rites for our enemy.

194
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:50,049
I have been supplying alcohol
to Usimjeong,

195
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,350
but one day, when I went there
to supply some clear alcohol,

196
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,190
I heard them whispering in one room.

197
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:00,059
They mentioned...

198
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:03,629
the Crown Princess...

199
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:05,660
and talked about getting revenge for her.

200
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,829
Stop with the nonsense.

201
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,470
Do you have a death wish?

202
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,869
Did you not order clear wine...

203
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:13,539
for the rite of Thief Kang?

204
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,269
We only held a rite...

205
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,569
because we pitied the Crown Prince.

206
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:19,410
Then...

207
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:22,049
did you hold one for Thief Kang as well?

208
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,920
Did you?

209
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,220
All we did...

210
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,789
was raise a glass of alcohol
for the Crown Princess as well.

211
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,759
You tell me, Administrator.

212
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:41,799
What should I do with them?

213
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:44,839
Thief Kang...

214
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:49,339
was someone who tried
to assassinate His Majesty,

215
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:53,339
so those who hold a service in remembrance
of a traitor are also considered traitors.

216
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:58,180
So you must punish them with death
by dismemberment to serve as an example.

217
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,119
Also, before that,

218
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:04,190
you must conduct an investigation...

219
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:09,130
to catch all the people
who conspired alongside them.

220
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:14,470
Punish all the traitors...

221
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:17,599
and uplift the nation, Your Majesty.

222
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:20,400
- Uplift the nation, Your Majesty.
- Uplift the nation, Your Majesty.

223
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,019
- Jang Hyun.
- Young Rang.

224
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,829
His Majesty
is calling the captives traitors.

225
00:18:43,829 --> 00:18:45,900
He put a man named Jang Chul in charge...

226
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,799
and created a group to subjugate them.

227
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,900
Jang Chul?

228
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,369
Yes.

229
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,809
He receives a lot of respect
from the scholars,

230
00:18:56,809 --> 00:19:00,480
so His Majesty said it had to be him.

231
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,150
But that man is looking for evidence.

232
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,079
Why I ought to break down...

233
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,390
the palace gates and...

234
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,490
Do not.

235
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,829
Then that will make you a traitor.

236
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,400
I am going to meet him.

237
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,029
Meet him? Who?

238
00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:27,700
The person I did not want...

239
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:31,309
to meet again in my life.

240
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:37,349
Master.

241
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,619
The leader of the traitors sent a letter.

242
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,589
He wants to meet you in secret.

243
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,369
Are you the one...

244
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,079
who leads the traitors?

245
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,250
Those people...

246
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,150
just raised their glasses...

247
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,059
to repay someone for his kindness.

248
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,690
The traitor...

249
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,690
nursed a grievance toward their parent...

250
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,700
and tried to kill him.

251
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,210
Was that report even true?

252
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,880
When it comes to treason,

253
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,079
any type of report is precious.

254
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:49,220
That is the way to protect the country.

255
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:52,519
Just like your father...

256
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:56,630
in the Year of Gichuk?

257
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,789
What?

258
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:03,829
Who are you?

259
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:09,269
You bought yourself a title
to become an aristocrat?

260
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,009
Then...

261
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,480
that means your name...

262
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,210
is also fake.

263
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,690
Do you want to know my real name?

264
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:28,529
My original name is Hyun.

265
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,460
And my surname is Jang.

266
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:37,430
Father,

267
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,809
it is me.

268
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,180
That is not possible

269
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,089
My son died long ago...

270
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:57,549
Did you think I died in the fire
started by the group of robbers?

271
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,839
Look.

272
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,839
I see it.

273
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:52,279
You look exactly like you did as a child.

274
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,410
My son.

275
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,119
What on earth happened?

276
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,519
How did you stay alive?

277
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:11,900
So...

278
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,500
why are you with the traitors?

279
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,940
Father.

280
00:23:25,109 --> 00:23:26,410
They are not traitors.

281
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:28,410
Hyun.

282
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:30,880
Save the prisoners.

283
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,380
They will live as if they are dead.

284
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:39,160
They honored Thief Kang in a rite.

285
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,690
How can we believe...

286
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:44,089
they will live as if they are dead?

287
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:52,240
Is that why you killed Sam Do as well?

288
00:23:58,579 --> 00:23:59,910
Sam Do also said...

289
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:05,119
he would live as if he were dead.

290
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:12,460
My sister loved Sam Do.

291
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:16,130
You knew that, did you not?

292
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,680
However,

293
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,519
you beat Sam Do to death...

294
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:43,619
for being a servant
who raped his mistress.

295
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:45,920
And my sister,

296
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:50,589
you sent across the icy river...

297
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:55,500
to run an errand.

298
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,940
My sister knew what you meant.

299
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,170
No...

300
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:09,009
Your sister did what she did
for your sake.

301
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,750
To not become an obstacle
in your bright future.

302
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,819
No!

303
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:17,619
My sister...

304
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,900
was unable to stand against you.

305
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,200
My sister...

306
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,069
did not have the courage...

307
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:39,579
to defy you and live.

308
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:48,789
I could not stand it.

309
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,019
I hated and resented you.

310
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:56,160
And so I decided...

311
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,430
to take from you...

312
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:04,670
what you considered precious.

313
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:20,519
Yes.

314
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,019
Father.

315
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,730
I did not go missing.

316
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,660
I took myself...

317
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:40,740
from you.

318
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:48,549
Son.

319
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,950
Annihilate the traitors.

320
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:56,049
Kill them all so no one is left living,

321
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,220
and no records of them will survive.

322
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:02,930
Soon,

323
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,960
the Palace Supply Bureau slaves
will come after you.

324
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,700
So hand over the traitors.

325
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:14,200
That is your only way out.

326
00:27:16,609 --> 00:27:17,640
I cannot...

327
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,250
lose you again, can I?

328
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,180
Father.

329
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:29,549
Please let us go.

330
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:35,490
We will live as if we are dead.

331
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:41,000
We will live as specks of dust.

332
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:44,900
You insist...

333
00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:49,369
on going against your father?

334
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,250
I...

335
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:38,349
liked you very much, Father.

336
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,430
When you realized
my sister truly loved Sam Do,

337
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,230
you...

338
00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:54,000
considered lifting his status...

339
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,609
(Slaves whose status was lifted
lived as commoners.)

340
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:58,369
so they could get married.

341
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:02,950
I thought you were...

342
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:10,049
so very admirable.

343
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:17,390
So I could not understand...

344
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:20,730
why you suddenly killed Sam Do.

345
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,240
Father.

346
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:40,819
I know...

347
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:44,789
who Sam Do is.

348
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,460
Sam Do...

349
00:29:57,329 --> 00:30:00,240
was the last living male
of the family that was killed off...

350
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,710
by your father's false report.

351
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:09,579
Sam Do...

352
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:14,220
put his love for my sister
over his revenge,

353
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:19,319
but you did not believe him
when he said...

354
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:22,289
he would live as if he were dead.

355
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,390
That is why you killed him.

356
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,069
Please...

357
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,440
let the prisoners live.

358
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:44,309
If...

359
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,390
you attack those who are dear to me,

360
00:30:52,819 --> 00:30:53,990
this time,

361
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:58,130
I will truly shatter...

362
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:01,700
what you consider dear to you.

363
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:11,839
Now I know.

364
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,150
What you consider most precious...

365
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:27,589
is not me.

366
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,500
Master.

367
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:40,539
The traitors have fled
the grounds of execution.

368
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:50,849
Take the women.

369
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,119
Come with us.

370
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:53,720
You can make sure...

371
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,519
Ttaeng Ttaeng gets food, right?

372
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:57,990
You must live,
even if it is for Ttaeng Ttaeng's sake.

373
00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:00,960
Go!

374
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:02,890
Let us go.

375
00:32:03,329 --> 00:32:04,529
Let us go!

376
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,000
What are you doing?

377
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:13,440
Hey!

378
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,240
Gu Yang Chun is over here!

379
00:32:15,339 --> 00:32:16,809
Gu Yang Chun is over here!

380
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,140
- Get him!
- Gu Yang Chun is over here!

381
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:31,849
Shoot.

382
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,069
My lord.

383
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:23,210
What about Yang Chun?

384
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,849
Jang Hyun.

385
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,759
Jang Hyun. The soldiers are coming.

386
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,079
You trust me, do you not?

387
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,279
Go to Neunggun-ri.

388
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,450
I will follow you soon.

389
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,960
These are people you saved
by risking your life.

390
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,960
I will make sure to keep them safe.

391
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,300
So,

392
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,070
you must keep your promise.

393
00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:27,440
Of course.

394
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,610
I will certainly keep it.

395
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,440
My mistress is here.

396
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,579
How would your servant die
without your permission?

397
00:35:14,949 --> 00:35:15,989
If...

398
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:21,820
you attack those who are dear to me,

399
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:25,429
this time,

400
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,369
I will truly shatter...

401
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,099
what you consider dear to you.

402
00:35:49,989 --> 00:35:54,960
Who are the people who pose a threat
to the court of this nation?

403
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,860
They are traitors
who befriended foreign intruders...

404
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,559
and sold off the profits of the nation.

405
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,769
They are women who lost their chastity
to foreign intruders...

406
00:36:03,769 --> 00:36:06,670
but do not know shame.

407
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:10,769
And they are promiscuous perverts
who engage in homosexual acts.

408
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,079
Those people have banded together...

409
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,579
with the intention
of dirtying this nation.

410
00:36:16,809 --> 00:36:19,519
What must we, the devoted scholars,

411
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:22,989
do in this situation?

412
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,739
Master.

413
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,039
I have something to tell you.

414
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:44,570
As you told me before,

415
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,380
I looked into Lee Jang Hyun.

416
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:49,380
His real name is Hyun, and he is...

417
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,809
A long time ago,

418
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,889
I lost both my daughter...

419
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,820
and my son.

420
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,230
My daughter, Lee Dan,

421
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:07,230
heard rumors
that she had an affair with a slave...

422
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,769
and took her own life.

423
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,670
I...

424
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:22,750
knew of my daughter's decision beforehand,

425
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,119
but I did not stop her.

426
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,619
The pain was excruciating,

427
00:37:33,389 --> 00:37:35,730
but my daughter and I were of one mind...

428
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,789
in protecting our family...

429
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,269
and maintained
that beautiful sense of loyalty.

430
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,699
In Joseon,
a land violated by foreign intruders,

431
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,510
the last dedication and sacrifice...

432
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:55,079
that we can show as scholars...

433
00:37:56,349 --> 00:37:58,179
What would that be?

434
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,349
Taking down those who hate me...

435
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,619
and those I hate...

436
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,090
is not sacrifice.

437
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,429
It is not courage either.

438
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,860
True sacrifice is...

439
00:38:16,269 --> 00:38:18,599
to rip out...

440
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,539
someone...

441
00:38:24,909 --> 00:38:28,440
who is as precious as my own life
for a greater loyalty.

442
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,579
That is sacrifice.

443
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:38,989
My dear.

444
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:42,360
Please help...

445
00:38:42,659 --> 00:38:43,829
Gil Chae.

446
00:38:44,659 --> 00:38:46,500
Please help Interpreter Lee.

447
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:48,260
We have reports of the captives' treason.

448
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:51,429
We will arrest them first
and decide who is right and wrong.

449
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,500
They will die if you arrest them.

450
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,309
This is about
the discipline of the nation.

451
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:00,380
There is no way.

452
00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:02,710
I am sure you are somehow mistaken.

453
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:05,280
Interpreter Lee is not that kind of man.

454
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:10,050
My dear,

455
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,389
do you trust Interpreter Lee more than me?

456
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,050
What are you doing?

457
00:40:21,789 --> 00:40:22,989
Why did you come here?

458
00:40:23,929 --> 00:40:25,059
Go.

459
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,260
Go now.

460
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,429
- You...
- They said it would be over...

461
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:31,769
as soon as they caught you.

462
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:33,969
What does that mean?

463
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:36,809
That means they will kill you
by any means possible.

464
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,380
I cannot watch that happen. No.

465
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,550
I will not.

466
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,780
So, go now.

467
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,250
Do you mean you will die instead of me
or something?

468
00:40:51,219 --> 00:40:52,320
Please go.

469
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,659
Please just save me this once.

470
00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:00,900
I...

471
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:05,469
cannot watch you die.

472
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:09,099
So, just go.

473
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:35,099
You must be very mistaken.

474
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:40,539
I can die instead of you,
but you cannot do the same.

475
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,010
Wait.

476
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,980
I will come back for you.

477
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:05,289
Hey, you.

478
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,000
What brings you here?

479
00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:10,429
Surrender.

480
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:11,969
Surrender without resisting,

481
00:42:12,469 --> 00:42:14,039
and the Department of Justice
will investigate...

482
00:42:14,469 --> 00:42:16,039
and make sure
none of you is unfairly punished.

483
00:42:17,739 --> 00:42:19,409
You are still as gullible as ever.

484
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:21,980
Instead of the royal guards,

485
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:24,010
your master sent slaves...

486
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:27,550
from the Palace Supply Bureau.
Can you not gauge the situation?

487
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,150
Or are you simply feigning ignorance?

488
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,300
We are here.

489
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:17,570
We are in Neunggun-ri.

490
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:21,670
Gil Chae!

491
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:32,980
Well done.

492
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:34,920
You went through so much.

493
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,489
I heard everything.

494
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:55,269
You went through a lot.

495
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,079
Where is your husband-to-be?

496
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,519
He will be here soon.

497
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:09,019
He promised me that he would come.

498
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,539
Can you hear it?

499
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:39,980
This sound.

500
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:45,650
The sound of the flowers.

501
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:06,059
I do not wish to hurt you.

502
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:10,800
You must have...

503
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,340
people who are waiting for you.

504
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,340
I, too,

505
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:22,739
have someone who is waiting for me.

506
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:26,679
So...

507
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:29,849
let me go.

508
00:47:34,389 --> 00:47:35,420
Let me...

509
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:39,800
return to my hometown.

510
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:52,980
Then,

511
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:55,539
what would you like me to do
with Lee Jang Hyun,

512
00:47:56,449 --> 00:47:57,550
the leader of the traitors?

513
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:02,679
Master.

514
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:05,420
His name is Hyun, and his surname is Jang.

515
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:07,360
His real name was Jang Hyun.

516
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,119
He is your...

517
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,190
Kill him.

518
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:13,730
Do you know this?

519
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:17,099
When a man is afraid,
his cruelty reveals itself.

520
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:19,030
How dare you call that mutt...

521
00:48:19,469 --> 00:48:22,139
a king's child?

522
00:50:09,409 --> 00:50:10,480
We wiped out...

523
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,449
all the leaders of the traitors,
including Lee Jang Hyun.

524
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:15,719
We dumped their bodies into the sea...

525
00:50:16,789 --> 00:50:18,250
to leave no trace.

526
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,789
Lee Jang Hyun...

527
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:25,059
must have had the Crown Prince's letter.

528
00:50:28,059 --> 00:50:29,099
Hand it over.

529
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:45,710
Master!

530
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:50,750
No!

531
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:53,360
Hyun.

532
00:50:54,989 --> 00:50:57,289
The two of us joined forces...

533
00:50:57,289 --> 00:50:58,329
Master!

534
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:00,199
to protect our family...

535
00:51:00,929 --> 00:51:04,570
and our beautiful loyalty.

536
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:35,599
So Hyun.

537
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:40,570
So Hyun.

538
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:42,670
So Hyun.

539
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,070
Crown Prince.

540
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:47,139
Crown Prince.

541
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:49,280
So Hyun...

542
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:04,829
Your Majesty.

543
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,980
That winter,

544
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:27,849
many people, whose lives were often
filled with laughter and tears, died.

545
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:33,659
I ranted about creating a world
filled with courtesy and loyalty.

546
00:52:35,789 --> 00:52:37,760
But what was I able to protect?

547
00:52:39,829 --> 00:52:41,900
What is the Joseon that I protected like?

548
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:46,570
After all this time,

549
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:49,440
the only thing that I have left...

550
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:54,179
is the sound of their laughter...

551
00:52:55,139 --> 00:52:56,880
which I will never get to hear again.

552
00:53:04,349 --> 00:53:06,119
Do you expect me to believe that?

553
00:53:07,289 --> 00:53:08,489
Everything that the captives,

554
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:11,360
Lee Jang Hyun,

555
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,800
the late Crown Prince, and Thief Kang
the Crown Princess, did together?

556
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,769
It is all true.

557
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:26,980
So please tell me now.

558
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:39,250
What happened...

559
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:45,460
to Lee Jang Hyun?

560
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:52,030
The Crown Prince has passed away.

561
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:55,539
When a lot of time had passed
since the Crown Prince was in Simyang,

562
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:59,670
he copied everything the Qing people did.

563
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:04,380
Out of the officials of the Crown Prince,
there was one who did not act like one...

564
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,949
What is this mess?

565
00:55:45,449 --> 00:55:47,050
After Madam left,

566
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:49,079
he became ruined.

567
00:55:57,329 --> 00:55:58,460
My lord.

568
00:56:07,369 --> 00:56:08,500
My lord!

569
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,170
My lord!

570
00:56:15,179 --> 00:56:16,280
My lord.

571
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,579
My lord.

572
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,059
Are you awake?

573
00:57:05,429 --> 00:57:06,489
That person...

574
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,670
I did not see him die with my own eyes.

575
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,510
Stop!

576
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,460
He is getting farther away.

577
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:38,929
Wait!

578
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:40,699
Will you go against my orders?

579
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,889
But he probably died.

580
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,500
He was already shedding a lot of blood.

581
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:22,500
I heard all the corpses
were thrown into the sea.

582
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:28,780
Yes.

583
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:33,780
But we could not find
Interpreter Lee's corpse.

584
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:40,150
I searched for years
trying to find his corpse,

585
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:44,960
and not too long ago, in a nearby village,

586
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:49,860
I heard that there was an old man
who was the last person...

587
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:52,469
to see Lee Jang Hyun.

588
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:56,070
If you ask him,

589
00:58:57,869 --> 00:59:00,480
you will probably be able to find
where his corpse was buried.

590
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:06,920
If you find where that is,

591
00:59:08,619 --> 00:59:10,050
please call me.

592
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:17,460
I would like to at least
offer him some alcohol.

593
00:59:42,219 --> 00:59:43,380
I am going to find him.

594
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:47,019
I am going to search everywhere...

595
00:59:48,219 --> 00:59:50,219
and return with his bones
at the very least.

596
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:17,920
I am also...

597
01:00:19,389 --> 01:00:21,460
thinking of going back to Neunggun-ri.

598
01:00:31,699 --> 01:00:32,969
Can I go with you...

599
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:36,900
to Neunggun-ri?

600
01:00:40,409 --> 01:00:41,440
I...

601
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,550
am still your husband.

602
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:29,590
So...

603
01:01:31,329 --> 01:01:32,460
I heard...

604
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:35,800
you were the last to see Interpreter Lee.

605
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:38,570
Do you know...

606
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:41,869
where he was buried?

607
01:02:01,289 --> 01:02:03,360
I owe him my life.

608
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:09,059
I was going to take it to my grave.

609
01:02:12,369 --> 01:02:14,099
If word got out that he was alive,

610
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,369
they might come back to kill him.

611
01:02:17,869 --> 01:02:19,869
So I kept it a secret.

612
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:30,219
What are you saying?

613
01:02:32,289 --> 01:02:33,289
He...

614
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:36,719
is not dead.

615
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:40,860
But...

616
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:41,460
He remembers nothing.

617
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:10,179
Why...

618
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:12,920
are you crying?

619
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:21,860
I do not know why,

620
01:04:24,269 --> 01:04:25,599
but seeing that moon...

621
01:04:29,369 --> 01:04:31,840
makes my heart ache, and I feel sad.

622
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:41,619
Whenever he looks at the moon,

623
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:45,119
he cries, then he laughs.

624
01:04:49,389 --> 01:04:50,460
Master.

625
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:52,960
Where would you go in this state?

626
01:04:54,429 --> 01:04:55,559
You cannot go.

627
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:02,340
I keep hearing something.

628
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:06,039
Thank you for everything.

629
01:05:15,019 --> 01:05:17,289
He said he would follow
the sound of flowers.

630
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,349
He just walked off.

631
01:05:31,699 --> 01:05:32,730
Where...

632
01:05:33,369 --> 01:05:34,900
Where did he go?

633
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:38,110
He said he did not give an answer.

634
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:39,909
That he had to tell her soon.

635
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:47,280
You see, you are...
From the moment I first saw you...

636
01:05:52,849 --> 01:05:53,949
Never mind.

637
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:59,360
What? What were you going to say?

638
01:05:59,630 --> 01:06:02,030
To me, you are...

639
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:08,199
Never mind.

640
01:06:08,199 --> 01:06:10,639
Just say it. What were you going to say?

641
01:06:10,769 --> 01:06:12,710
Everyone must be waiting.
We should go inside.

642
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:15,010
Wait.

643
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:16,980
Finish your sentence.

644
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:18,349
What were you going to say?

645
01:06:18,579 --> 01:06:19,980
The day we first met... Yes.

646
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:21,780
We met by the swing. What about it?

647
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:23,619
Come on. What were you going to say?

648
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:24,789
Hey!

649
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:28,619
He said she desperately wanted to know,

650
01:06:28,789 --> 01:06:30,119
and he did not tell her.

651
01:06:31,489 --> 01:06:32,630
He meant...

652
01:06:34,659 --> 01:06:36,099
In a moment,

653
01:06:37,369 --> 01:06:39,769
she stole away my heart.

654
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,170
So now, my heart...

655
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:50,539
cannot turn back,
and I should have told her.

656
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,869
Do you know him?

657
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,739
He kept coming by for days.

658
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:22,110
Excuse me.

659
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:27,519
You are back again.

660
01:07:28,519 --> 01:07:30,519
The person you are looking for
is not here.

661
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:40,760
That cannot be.

662
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:45,300
She told me not to worry.

663
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:49,869
She said she could
wait a month with a smile.

664
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:16,859
That is when I knew.

665
01:08:18,529 --> 01:08:19,630
My husband...

666
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:23,569
was tracing his memory
from the day we met...

667
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:27,210
so he could come back to me.

668
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:46,260
So...

669
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,260
where are you now?

670
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:53,170
Where must I go to...

671
01:09:02,539 --> 01:09:03,539
Very well.

672
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:06,909
Then how do you wish to live...

673
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,050
your life from now on, Gil Chae?

674
01:09:15,619 --> 01:09:17,159
I wish to...

675
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,869
Before, I wished to live...

676
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,239
in a bustling place with many people.

677
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:35,340
But with you,

678
01:09:36,609 --> 01:09:38,279
I wish to live quietly,

679
01:09:39,149 --> 01:09:41,680
just the two of us.

680
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:48,689
On a mountain close to Neunggun-ri,

681
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:52,159
there is a place with a stream...

682
01:09:54,159 --> 01:09:57,100
and a path lined with trees that flower.

683
01:09:59,329 --> 01:10:02,399
I would like to build
a small house with two rooms.

684
01:10:04,739 --> 01:10:07,640
Build a fence with forsythia branches.

685
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:12,050
I would keep three hens...

686
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:15,449
and collect eggs each morning.

687
01:10:20,319 --> 01:10:22,220
I will enjoy the flowers in the spring.

688
01:10:24,659 --> 01:10:27,289
In the summer,
I will wet my feet in the stream.

689
01:10:29,859 --> 01:10:32,000
In the fall,
I will make wild grape wine...

690
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,869
and drink that in the winter months.

691
01:11:03,930 --> 01:11:05,930
I will enjoy the flowers in the spring.

692
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:25,750
In the summer,
I will wet my feet in the stream.

693
01:11:49,609 --> 01:11:51,779
In the fall,
I will make wild grape wine...

694
01:11:53,079 --> 01:11:55,180
and drink that in the winter months.

695
01:13:23,770 --> 01:13:25,210
Have you lost your way?

696
01:13:28,539 --> 01:13:30,609
I was looking for a person.

697
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:34,479
A person?

698
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:36,319
Who?

699
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:39,920
My husband.

700
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,590
What does your husband look like?

701
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:48,060
He is handsome.

702
01:13:54,029 --> 01:13:56,100
I cannot help you if you say that.

703
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:02,180
Why are you fixing the fence?

704
01:14:07,949 --> 01:14:09,119
I was asked...

705
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:14,050
to make the fence
as tall as a young child.

706
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,270
Are you not leaving?

707
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:06,939
I told you. I have not seen
a handsome man in these parts.

708
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:29,600
Would you like some food?

709
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:54,350
You eat a lot.

710
01:15:57,359 --> 01:15:58,659
The food is delicious.

711
01:15:59,630 --> 01:16:01,859
How is it that you can cook so well?

712
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:11,340
Why are you smiling like that?

713
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:14,340
You smile strangely.

714
01:16:15,479 --> 01:16:16,609
It is a bit odd.

715
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:30,560
It is late today,
so I will let you use this room.

716
01:16:30,789 --> 01:16:32,130
But when the day breaks,

717
01:16:32,329 --> 01:16:34,260
you should leave to find your husband.

718
01:19:49,359 --> 01:19:51,289
What are you doing here?

719
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:09,909
Why do you live alone...

720
01:20:11,109 --> 01:20:12,680
in a place like this?

721
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:18,619
I am waiting.

722
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:23,060
For what?

723
01:20:28,899 --> 01:20:31,529
She said she wanted to live
in a place like this.

724
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:33,800
However...

725
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:50,619
Should you not leave
to look for your husband?

726
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:56,189
Yes, I should find him.

727
01:20:57,590 --> 01:20:59,489
So please help me.

728
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:01,659
How could I help you?

729
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:05,029
I will tell you all about my husband.

730
01:21:06,329 --> 01:21:08,539
Please try to remember if you have seen...

731
01:21:09,170 --> 01:21:11,069
someone like him.

732
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,310
First and foremost, my husband is...

733
01:21:18,210 --> 01:21:20,279
very handsome.

734
01:21:23,479 --> 01:21:24,579
Here we go again.

735
01:21:26,319 --> 01:21:27,489
My husband...

736
01:21:28,989 --> 01:21:31,659
always kept his promises.

737
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:37,060
Once, my husband asked me
how I wished to live.

738
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:43,500
I said I wanted to live
in a place with a stream.

739
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:49,510
In a thatched-roof house at the end
of a path lined with trees that flower.

740
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:54,180
In the fall,
I would make wild grape wine...

741
01:21:55,649 --> 01:21:57,579
and drink that in the winter months.

742
01:22:01,789 --> 01:22:04,159
I told him
I wanted to live with him like that.

743
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:14,630
There is something
I truly wish to tell my husband.

744
01:22:16,670 --> 01:22:18,069
If I meet him again,

745
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:21,170
I really want...

746
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:23,609
to tell him.

747
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:28,920
And I must hear his answer.

748
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:42,430
That day.

749
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:47,270
The day we first met.

750
01:22:50,670 --> 01:22:51,939
When you were on the swing,

751
01:22:52,869 --> 01:22:54,140
what were you thinking about?

752
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:02,479
I do not remember.

753
01:23:08,090 --> 01:23:09,090
Is that so?

754
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:10,920
What about you?

755
01:23:11,829 --> 01:23:13,760
What were you thinking about that day?

756
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:17,529
That day...

757
01:23:20,270 --> 01:23:22,399
I heard a truly rare sound.

758
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:25,470
What sound?

759
01:24:01,939 --> 01:24:03,409
That day,

760
01:24:05,649 --> 01:24:08,979
I felt like the man of my dream
would approach me.

761
01:24:12,149 --> 01:24:14,220
So everything before me...

762
01:24:16,659 --> 01:24:17,760
turned green...

763
01:24:18,930 --> 01:24:21,289
and pink.

764
01:24:58,130 --> 01:24:59,199
My dear husband.

765
01:25:04,569 --> 01:25:06,170
It is I, Gil Chae.

766
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:27,829
Now, please answer my question.

767
01:25:31,630 --> 01:25:32,670
What was...

768
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:35,539
the sound you heard that day?

769
01:25:41,939 --> 01:25:42,979
The sound of the flowers.

770
01:25:45,109 --> 01:25:46,210
The sound of the marvel of Peru blooming.

771
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:26,750
Gil Chae.

772
01:26:38,670 --> 01:26:39,699
Gil Chae.

773
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:06,130
I was waiting...

774
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:14,199
for you.

775
01:27:18,069 --> 01:27:19,109
Right here.

776
01:27:20,869 --> 01:27:21,979
For a very long time.
