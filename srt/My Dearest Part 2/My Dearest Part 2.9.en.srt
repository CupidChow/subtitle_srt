(This drama is a work of fiction
created based on historical facts.)

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,980
(Most of the details and depictions
of the characters are fictional.)

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:06,679
My lord.

4
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,730
My lord.

5
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:23,829
Are you awake?

6
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,780
My lord.

7
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,009
Please, My lord.

8
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,820
No.

9
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,119
My lord.

10
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,460
My lord.

11
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:57,630
Gosh, it is cold.

12
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:02,329
Goodness, gracious.

13
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,909
I am taking him home as he is drunk.

14
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:08,739
Do not mind us.

15
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:16,310
Go. I told you to go.

16
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,250
Should I help you?

17
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,599
Hey.

18
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,170
Why are you making such a fuss?

19
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,739
It is gone.

20
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:47,810
Gu Yang Chun's body is gone.

21
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:03,060
Thank you.

22
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:04,700
I do not understand...

23
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,730
why they are constantly beating
people to a pulp at the palace.

24
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,370
My lord.

25
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:17,539
Madam.

26
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:26,419
My lord.

27
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:28,889
My lord.

28
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:31,889
My lord.

29
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,490
My lord!

30
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:36,659
Jong Jong.

31
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,060
Go and get some water.
And some towels too.

32
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,300
Yes, Madam.

33
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,310
My lord!

34
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,050
(Episode 19)

35
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:03,919
Your Majesty!

36
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,789
His Highness, the Crown Prince, has gotten
more ill and has lost consciousness.

37
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,300
Your Highness.

38
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,590
His Majesty sent a physician...

39
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:38,919
for His Highness.

40
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,879
He has a high fever with chills.

41
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,289
Can he take the heated needle?

42
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:11,389
(Beonchim: A technique where a hot needle
is inserted into acupuncture points)

43
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,779
Please do something.

44
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:37,120
Anything!

45
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,689
Please do not leave like this.

46
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,689
Please.

47
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,189
Please!

48
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,730
My lord.

49
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,139
My lord.

50
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,310
What on earth happened?

51
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,139
And what happened to Gu Jam?

52
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,120
I must bring Lord Lee elsewhere.

53
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,189
Pardon me?

54
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:22,730
Why?

55
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:24,500
The eunuch who helped me...

56
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,199
knows this place.

57
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:36,670
Gu Yang Chun's corpse is gone.

58
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,339
That incompetent brat!

59
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,089
Has he revealed where he was moved to?

60
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,959
Baedan-ri, sir.

61
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,699
My lord, we must go. Please...

62
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:04,699
Madam!

63
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,410
Some men are searching the village now.

64
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,949
Ryang Eum.

65
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,579
Let me take him.

66
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,290
They will be here in no time.

67
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:25,860
Keep him safe.

68
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,040
I told you. I do not know such a person.

69
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,850
There is nothing here!

70
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:08,370
Are you sure it was this house?

71
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:26,120
A man was seen leaving the village...

72
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,019
on his horse with someone else on it.

73
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:30,250
Come along!

74
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:55,680
Is there a man staying with you here?

75
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:03,819
Who are you people?

76
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,689
How dare you set foot in here?

77
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,759
I am sure it is this house.

78
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,829
I invited a singer,

79
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:14,000
who will sing
at my master's birthday party.

80
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,209
What do you think you are doing?

81
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:28,079
If my master finds out...

82
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,180
Your master?

83
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,789
I heard a woman who had been ruined
by a foreign intruder lived here.

84
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,090
A man who took in a girl who had been
dirtied by a foreign intruder.

85
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,259
Do you think we would fear such a man?

86
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,929
What is all this fuss about?

87
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,929
What brings you here at this early hour?

88
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:53,600
How dare you raise your voice in my house?

89
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:55,809
My lord.

90
00:08:56,809 --> 00:08:57,980
- My lord!
- My lord!

91
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:19,259
I believe that Jang Hyun...

92
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,600
will wake up soon...

93
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,570
because you are right by his side,
Ryang Eum.

94
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,610
A while back,
when Jang Hyun was away on business,

95
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,350
you got into a fight...

96
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,120
with another customer
at the courtesan house and got hurt.

97
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,950
Did you know that Jang Hyun stopped by
that night?

98
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,789
As soon as he heard that you got hurt,

99
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:48,429
he gave up on 7,000 nyang of silver
and came back.

100
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,330
He came by...

101
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,830
to see if you were okay
and left again right away.

102
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,799
A friend of mine once asked him...

103
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:59,570
while serving him.

104
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,809
"Why do you care so much about Ryang Eum?"

105
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:06,480
Then he said,

106
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:10,649
"Seeing Ryang Eum enjoy his life
gives me joy."

107
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,779
That was his answer.

108
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,919
So he would never die...

109
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,159
and leave you behind all alone.

110
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,460
How is Lord Lee?

111
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,460
How is he?

112
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,809
I wondered...

113
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,740
whom Jang Hyun
would want to see the most...

114
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,309
in his final moments.

115
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:21,220
Go and see him.

116
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:51,820
My lord.

117
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,720
It is me, Gil Chae.

118
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,129
"Observation leads you to knowledge."

119
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,070
"Knowledge leads you to integrity."

120
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,539
"Integrity leads you to enlightenment."

121
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:21,009
"Enlightenment leads you to health."

122
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,509
You can whistle pretty well.

123
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:27,710
I shall give you a nickname.

124
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,850
Ryang Eum.

125
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:31,779
"Ryang Eum?"

126
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,320
It means "to reach the note."

127
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,889
Hyun!

128
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,159
Sister!

129
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:15,559
Hyun.

130
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,330
Do you hear?

131
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,700
When he smiles,

132
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,730
I hear flowers bloom.

133
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,340
Father!

134
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,669
Father!

135
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,570
Father!

136
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,139
Father!

137
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:41,919
Stop! Do not hit him!

138
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:43,720
Do not hit him!

139
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,529
Young Master.

140
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:51,399
I am sorry, Young Master.

141
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,830
Hyun.

142
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,350
My lord.

143
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,590
My lord.

144
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,330
My lord.

145
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:26,860
My lord, please.

146
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:30,029
My lord.

147
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,600
My lord.

148
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,350
My lord.

149
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,450
You are awake.

150
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,860
Ryang Eum!

151
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,830
My lord.

152
00:15:58,799 --> 00:15:59,799
My lord.

153
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,279
Where am I?

154
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:14,080
All is well.

155
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,649
You are well.

156
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:32,899
Who...

157
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,799
are you?

158
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,690
How is he?

159
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:31,890
He is fine. He has made it.

160
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:34,859
Then...

161
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:37,430
why does he not recognize us?

162
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,970
The hit missed and did not harm his skull.

163
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,170
So give it time.

164
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,410
He might remember you, and he might never.

165
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,170
But he is alive at least.

166
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,119
See?

167
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,420
All that touching
almost made the wound fester.

168
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:04,559
How strange.

169
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:09,130
You seem younger than me,

170
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:11,059
so why speak like you are older?

171
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,269
Are you a physician?

172
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,839
You seem sure-handed.

173
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,210
I learned a lot, thanks to someone.

174
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,849
I learned to play the geomungo,

175
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:30,980
and to shoot arrows.

176
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:33,420
Someone kept getting hurt,

177
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,690
so I learned how to treat wounds as well.

178
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:37,390
Who was that?

179
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,859
Was it...

180
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,329
a woman you loved?

181
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,799
I am done.

182
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,319
You know, I...

183
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:07,619
Over there.

184
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,890
Who is that woman?

185
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,359
Of all people, I thought...

186
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,470
you would at least remember her.

187
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,880
I do not remember.

188
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,319
But I enjoy...

189
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,119
watching her.

190
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,250
Here.

191
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,700
Open wide.

192
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,950
So, why are you so nice to me?

193
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,089
Compared to what you did for me,

194
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,490
this is nothing at all.

195
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,029
Was I good to you?

196
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,769
Not just good.

197
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,009
That young man.

198
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,480
His name is Ryang Eum?

199
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,690
Someone I know has the same name.

200
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:31,059
I owned a servant named Sam Do.

201
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,529
"Sam Do?"

202
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,369
Yes. He whistled very well,

203
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,140
so I gave him the nickname "Ryang Eum."

204
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:39,700
And...

205
00:21:44,109 --> 00:21:45,539
And...

206
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,779
his name is also Ryang Eum?

207
00:21:52,849 --> 00:21:53,880
How strange.

208
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:57,490
Ryang Eum...

209
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:02,259
is the name I gave Sam Do.

210
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:12,099
My lord.

211
00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:25,549
Your Highness.

212
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,759
Do you have any news about Lee Jang Hyun?

213
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:35,930
In Joseon,

214
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,859
the Crown Prince's people
are all being purged.

215
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,900
Is that true?

216
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:19,069
Your Highness.

217
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:24,779
Look at this.

218
00:23:30,579 --> 00:23:31,619
Was I...

219
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,680
in bed for a long time?

220
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,750
It is fine now that you are up.

221
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:48,799
I am hungry.

222
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:53,200
Prepare some milk porridge.

223
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,269
(Tarak porridge:
porridge with ground rice in milk)

224
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:55,309
No.

225
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,009
I will do it.

226
00:23:58,809 --> 00:23:59,910
I will make it myself.

227
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,230
You may all leave.

228
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,480
What about Jang Hyun?

229
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:39,380
What happened to Interpreter Lee?

230
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:44,650
I believe Interpreter Lee...

231
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:49,490
is safe and sound.

232
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,299
Good.

233
00:24:57,099 --> 00:24:59,670
Prepare my desk so I may write a letter.

234
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,069
I want to rest.

235
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,099
Yes, Your Highness.

236
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:28,329
However, the Crown Princess
will be bringing your milk porridge.

237
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:29,690
Right.

238
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:34,230
I must eat the milk porridge she made.

239
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,269
Yes, Your Highness.

240
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:51,819
Your Highness.

241
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,019
Your Highness, I have made you
some milk porridge myself...

242
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:15,970
Your Highness.

243
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:23,150
Your Highness.

244
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,380
Your Highness!

245
00:27:25,579 --> 00:27:26,779
Your Highness!

246
00:27:28,819 --> 00:27:30,289
Your Highness!

247
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,829
Your Majesty!

248
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:40,660
Please move those who are being kept
in the Palace Supply Bureau...

249
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,599
to the Department of Justice.

250
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:46,970
- Move them to the Department of Justice!
- Move them to the Department of Justice!

251
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,069
Please move those who are being kept
in the Palace Supply Bureau...

252
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:52,279
to the Department of Justice.

253
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:53,410
Master!

254
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,710
His Highness, the Crown Prince...

255
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:08,960
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

256
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:14,559
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

257
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,130
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

258
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:21,569
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

259
00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:25,509
Your Highness!

260
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:29,410
Your Highness.

261
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:35,490
You must wake up.

262
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:43,890
Your Highness.

263
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:51,170
Crown Prince!

264
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:01,910
My son...

265
00:31:03,369 --> 00:31:04,829
Jang Hyun, read this.

266
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,970
Hyun!

267
00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:18,349
I shall give you a nickname.

268
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,380
Ryang Eum.

269
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,490
"Ryang Eum?"

270
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:26,990
Hyun.

271
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,000
I will be away from home for a few days.

272
00:31:40,369 --> 00:31:42,109
If people ask,
say that I went to visit my family.

273
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:46,779
Is Interpreter Lee all right?

274
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,480
Well...

275
00:31:49,849 --> 00:31:51,279
Is there any news of Gu Jam?

276
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:38,829
Anybody home?

277
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:55,380
I heard you had been struggling
since your divorce.

278
00:32:57,349 --> 00:33:00,049
Why did you not ask the Crown Princess
for help?

279
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:04,420
People are pointing fingers at me,
calling me a girl ruined by an intruder.

280
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:08,619
I was afraid
it might cause Her Highness harm...

281
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:10,990
if people found out I knew her.

282
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,630
You...

283
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,200
and Interpreter Lee...

284
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:18,069
were quite close in Simyang.

285
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,670
Are you still in contact with him?

286
00:33:24,009 --> 00:33:25,109
No, of course not.

287
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,710
I have never seen him
since I returned to Joseon.

288
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:32,619
I see.

289
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:36,049
I brought some jewelry for you.

290
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:41,220
The Crown Princess heard that
you had been struggling financially...

291
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:42,789
and sent these for you.

292
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:44,960
There is no need.

293
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:47,359
Her Highness wishes to repay you
for saving her son.

294
00:33:49,769 --> 00:33:52,299
Her Highness prepared them herself.

295
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,470
Be sure...

296
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,210
to keep them forever.

297
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:08,849
Your Majesty.

298
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:13,219
I understand that His Highness
the Crown Prince just passed away,

299
00:34:14,059 --> 00:34:16,190
but we should install His Highness'
eldest son as heir apparent...

300
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,789
Install him?

301
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:19,530
Yes, Your Majesty.

302
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:23,929
We cannot leave
such an important position vacant.

303
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,170
So please...

304
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,869
Do you already wish
to win the favor of his eldest son?

305
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:57,530
You know...

306
00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:00,500
that the Crown Princess buried
a cursed object in the palace.

307
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,610
No, I do not...

308
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,579
You are scared, are you not?

309
00:35:11,949 --> 00:35:13,849
Yes, I see that you are terrified.

310
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,650
All you have to do is
tell me what you saw and heard.

311
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:21,789
Do you wish to die in pain,
like those people?

312
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:23,329
You do not, right?

313
00:35:26,659 --> 00:35:28,630
Even if you have made up your mind to die,

314
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:31,269
it is not like
you will be the only one dying.

315
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:34,400
You should think about your old parents...

316
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:37,710
and your little sister,
who is still young.

317
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:40,679
You know?

318
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:52,789
The Crown Princess is involved
in a shameful affair.

319
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:56,960
So how could we install her child?

320
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,630
Hence,

321
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,929
I wish to expel the Crown Princess
and send her to a faraway place...

322
00:36:01,929 --> 00:36:03,599
to prevent trouble.

323
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,480
Your Majesty.

324
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:17,909
Do you wish to expel her
because of the rumor...

325
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:19,719
that she put a curse on the main hall?

326
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:21,980
However, you cannot banish...

327
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,420
the mother of the Crown Prince's
eldest son without evidence.

328
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,760
He is right, Your Majesty.

329
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:31,159
You cannot banish the mother
of the Crown Prince's eldest son.

330
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,230
Your Majesty,
the Crown Princess is your child too.

331
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,960
How could you speak
of banishing her so easily?

332
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:38,530
Evidence, you say?

333
00:36:40,269 --> 00:36:42,239
Jin Saeng,
One of the Crown Princess' maids,

334
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,710
confessed that the Crown Princess
buried a cursed object in the palace...

335
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:48,139
to put a curse on the main hall.

336
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:52,750
It is truly a mess.

337
00:36:53,849 --> 00:36:56,050
And you say she is my child too?

338
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,090
How dare you call that mutt...

339
00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:02,219
a king's child?

340
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:15,000
The first time
the cursed object was found in the palace,

341
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,539
Lady Cho said
it was the Crown Princess' doing.

342
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,909
But the ministers
including Choi Myung Gil...

343
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:22,179
protected the Crown Princess,
saying there was no evidence.

344
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:26,179
However, Jin Saeng's confession
has completely changed the situation.

345
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,679
Now, no one is willing to speak up...

346
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,190
or defend the Crown Princess...

347
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:32,420
for everyone is afraid
they would be labeled as a traitor too.

348
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,820
Master.

349
00:37:35,659 --> 00:37:37,130
At a time like this, you should...

350
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,230
But what if...

351
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:42,469
Jin Saeng's confession is true?

352
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,940
If the Crown Princess
truly had put a curse on the main hall,

353
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,840
that is like a child
putting a curse on her own father,

354
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,739
which violates the moral code...

355
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,349
and shakes the foundation of this nation.

356
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,619
In Joseon,

357
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,880
children are dutiful to their parents,

358
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,619
wives serve their husbands,

359
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:08,190
and vassals must remain loyal
to their king.

360
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,929
Joseon could hold out...

361
00:38:11,929 --> 00:38:13,860
despite
the foreign intruders' invasions...

362
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:16,800
for the moral code has remained intact.

363
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:20,199
People say...

364
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,570
that things like courtesy and loyalty...

365
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:25,110
are useless in this world
ruled by the foreign intruders,

366
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,010
but we...

367
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,150
No, you and I...

368
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:35,119
know very well
what courtesy and loyalty...

369
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,889
can help us protect.

370
00:38:42,659 --> 00:38:43,730
Your Majesty.

371
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:47,130
I request a cross-examination with
Jin Saeng.

372
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,800
Treason?

373
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,170
Assassination?

374
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:56,570
I poisoned the grilled abalone
prepared for Your Majesty...

375
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:58,869
and hid a cursed object
in your chambers...

376
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,309
to put a curse on Your Majesty?

377
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,510
That is not true.

378
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:09,650
They did nothing wrong, Your Majesty!

379
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:12,190
Your Majesty!

380
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,929
How dare she raise her voice at me
like that?

381
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:22,900
I bet someone has got her back.

382
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:29,769
I am certain that the Crown Princess
won them over...

383
00:39:29,769 --> 00:39:31,639
with the wealth
she had gathered in Simyang.

384
00:39:32,409 --> 00:39:33,840
By "them," you mean...

385
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,280
The captives whom
the Crown Prince helped get released.

386
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,019
She thinks she can be that insolent
because she is counting on them.

387
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:50,889
It is important that we do not
let our guard down at a time like this.

388
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,159
We must inspect everyone
at each checkpoint.

389
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,929
(Gichal:
Inspecting pedestrians at checkpoints)

390
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:56,630
Summon the chiefs of the Police Bureau...

391
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,599
and tell them
to patrol the area more often...

392
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:01,739
to keep treasonous scoundrels out
even at night.

393
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:05,340
And tell the Minister of War
not to leave the palace.

394
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:07,179
Also,

395
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,780
you are to join
the Office of the Royal Guard.

396
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:11,510
Yes, Your Majesty.

397
00:40:23,429 --> 00:40:26,530
If a coup takes place
while I am distracted,

398
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:30,329
it will be too late for regrets.

399
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,300
This man is the leader of the traitors.

400
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,269
His corpse is gone.

401
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:39,739
If he is still alive,
we must catch him at all costs.

402
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:41,639
If you catch him,

403
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,210
you have my permission
to kill him on the spot.

404
00:40:48,449 --> 00:40:49,489
Excuse me.

405
00:40:50,389 --> 00:40:52,349
- Have you seen this man?
- No, I have not.

406
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,460
Hey, excuse me.

407
00:40:55,889 --> 00:40:57,460
Have you seen this man?

408
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,429
Hyun.

409
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,599
I promise I will always protect you.

410
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:59,250
You cannot be out on your own.

411
00:43:03,019 --> 00:43:04,250
Did I...

412
00:43:06,789 --> 00:43:09,090
do something wrong again?

413
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,360
I am sorry.

414
00:43:16,699 --> 00:43:17,929
It is not that.

415
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:23,710
What are you doing?

416
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:31,610
Thank you.

417
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,519
Thank you so much...

418
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,920
for staying alive.

419
00:43:42,059 --> 00:43:43,829
Your arms...

420
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:48,460
I will not go out alone, so will you...

421
00:43:48,829 --> 00:43:49,929
No.

422
00:43:50,699 --> 00:43:52,469
We are allowed to do this.

423
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,170
What?

424
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,539
You remember nothing.

425
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:59,980
So take my word for it.

426
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,789
I will believe you if you will...

427
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,130
Look.

428
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,070
Do not lose it ever again.

429
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,639
What is this?

430
00:44:30,269 --> 00:44:32,139
Put it where it is meant to be.

431
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,309
Where is it meant to be?

432
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,420
What the...

433
00:44:44,219 --> 00:44:45,320
My chest...

434
00:44:53,059 --> 00:44:54,530
Did we really...

435
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:57,530
do childish things like this?

436
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:58,699
Yes.

437
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,340
Let me see...

438
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:07,039
Darn it.

439
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,619
Did you curse?

440
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,519
You know,

441
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,489
you keep touching me.

442
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:24,329
It is said that...

443
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:27,329
since the age of seven,
men and women must sit apart...

444
00:45:27,329 --> 00:45:29,000
I told you already.

445
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:31,599
We are allowed to do this.

446
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:34,139
Let us play again.

447
00:45:35,239 --> 00:45:36,269
Go on.

448
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,219
Well done.

449
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:55,989
Open wide.

450
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:58,289
Come on.

451
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,230
This is shameful.

452
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:06,699
I told you already.

453
00:46:07,269 --> 00:46:09,639
- We are allowed to...
- Okay, fine.

454
00:46:10,369 --> 00:46:11,440
Good.

455
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:16,809
- That is dry, so have some broth.
- Okay.

456
00:46:22,849 --> 00:46:24,019
Well done.

457
00:46:32,929 --> 00:46:34,099
Here.

458
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:54,980
Are you crazy?

459
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:58,889
Even if we are allowed to do some things,

460
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,190
do you not think
that was too much in broad daylight?

461
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,559
We used to do this.

462
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:35,920
Until the last moment,

463
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,630
you held this ring in your hand.

464
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:43,199
I did?

465
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:45,699
What...

466
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:55,809
Well,

467
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,619
now that I have no memory,

468
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,650
I am a burden.

469
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,530
Shall I be honest?

470
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:21,500
For a long time,

471
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:25,809
I wished for us...

472
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:30,650
to exchange childish jokes
and wonder what to eat for dinner.

473
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,980
I wished so ardently...

474
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,719
for that kind of simple life.

475
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,090
It is possible that...

476
00:48:42,659 --> 00:48:46,059
this moment is my happiest one with you.

477
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:50,829
Then...

478
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,900
if my memory never returns,

479
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:56,570
will you not abandon me?

480
00:48:58,039 --> 00:48:59,539
Me, abandon you?

481
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:02,780
Watch and see.

482
00:49:04,409 --> 00:49:05,980
Even if I die,

483
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,320
I will never leave your side again.

484
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:16,389
Lee Jang Hyun.

485
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,250
I am here for you.

486
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,230
The Hoemaengje ceremony...

487
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:37,030
is a place where the vassals swear
their allegiance to their king.

488
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:42,539
Today, we have shared the same blood.

489
00:51:46,409 --> 00:51:48,380
Lady Kang was protesting
with her voice raised,

490
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:51,050
which I thought was very odd at first.

491
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:54,050
But now that I think,

492
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,690
she must have done so by trusting
those who are supporting her.

493
00:52:01,019 --> 00:52:03,119
Think about what happened
during Gwanghae's reign.

494
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,199
The enemy must always be nearby.

495
00:52:09,099 --> 00:52:11,630
What if a treacherous revolt occurs...

496
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:14,670
and the nation falls to its ruin?
What will you do then?

497
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:23,309
Have Lady Kang thrown out of the palace
and have her die at home.

498
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:28,280
Seek out all of her supporters
and get rid of all of them!

499
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,500
Your Highness.

500
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,199
Please come.

501
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,210
How have you ended up in such a state?

502
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:33,539
(Choi Myung Gil)

503
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:35,110
(Kim Sang Heon)

504
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:37,780
Do you regret what happened in the past?

505
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:39,110
"Regret?"

506
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,880
The reason why I took the lead in
reconciling with the foreign intruders...

507
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,050
in the Year of Byeongja...

508
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:47,219
was solely for the Joseon court...

509
00:54:47,219 --> 00:54:48,659
I mean making...

510
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:51,530
His Majesty the king.

511
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:54,030
Do you regret it?

512
00:54:58,199 --> 00:55:00,570
You joined hands with Kim Ja Jeom
and Kim Ryu...

513
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:02,599
to have Prince Neungyang take the throne.

514
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:04,210
(Prince Neungyang: King Injo's title
before being crowned king)

515
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:07,739
No one expected Prince Neungyang
to seek to rise to the throne.

516
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:10,710
He was mild and afraid of many things.

517
00:55:14,619 --> 00:55:18,489
But what I see now is
that our king is a fighter.

518
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:23,260
When he felt a threat to his life,
he became more shrewd than anyone.

519
00:55:24,329 --> 00:55:28,300
No one could have stopped
Prince Neungyang back then.

520
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,269
And it is the same now.

521
00:55:32,869 --> 00:55:34,170
Our king...

522
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:37,639
feels that his life is being threatened.

523
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,380
Some paths lead to death even in life
and others lead to life even in death.

524
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:46,079
In the Year of Byeongja,

525
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,420
we should have fought against
the foreign intruders until the very end.

526
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:54,960
Then, His Majesty would not have
broken down as he has now.

527
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:56,460
Then...

528
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:58,460
Did you come to say that?

529
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,900
I came because I was afraid.

530
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:08,170
What might become of this nation...

531
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,269
I am afraid.

532
00:56:13,239 --> 00:56:15,809
Still, the only person I could tell
my inner thoughts to...

533
00:56:21,849 --> 00:56:23,119
was you.

534
00:56:37,369 --> 00:56:38,599
Thief Kang...

535
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:41,940
took the poison
but did not die right away.

536
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,639
She suffered for two days...

537
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:46,269
and finally drew her last breath.

538
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:51,280
You are seeking out
Thief Kang's supporters, are you not?

539
00:56:53,849 --> 00:56:55,679
I am suspicious of the interpreters.

540
00:56:56,889 --> 00:57:00,789
The interpreters have been
in close contact with the people of Qing.

541
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,559
Dig into the lives
of all the interpreters...

542
00:57:05,559 --> 00:57:07,659
who were close to the Crown Prince
back in Simyang.

543
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,829
Yes, Your Majesty.

544
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:14,699
What are the reactions from the nobility?

545
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,409
How about Choi Myung Gil?

546
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:23,210
It is suspicious that Myung Gil
defended Lady Kang until the end.

547
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:27,219
By any chance,

548
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:31,190
will Choi Myung Gil get any silly ideas?

549
00:57:37,289 --> 00:57:38,960
I did not protect you...

550
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:43,900
and put up with being called
a traitor who sold his nation off...

551
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,230
just to see you like this.

552
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:54,110
However,

553
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:56,909
I am sure this is also my fate.

554
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,550
I want to rest now.

555
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:06,289
No more.

556
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:10,889
(Choi Myung Gil dies of old age...)

557
00:58:10,889 --> 00:58:15,059
(at age 62.)

558
00:58:25,539 --> 00:58:26,739
Those jerks.

559
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,780
How could they do this to a man?

560
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:32,610
If I ever run into them on the streets,

561
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,280
I will rip out all of their hair.

562
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:38,250
Their hair?

563
00:58:39,719 --> 00:58:40,820
Right.

564
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:43,019
There. You can turn around now.

565
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:44,030
Yes.

566
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:47,300
Here.

567
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:56,699
Goodness.

568
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:09,750
Still, it is a relief that your wounds
are healing well.

569
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:14,159
- Here too.
- Wait.

570
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,159
It is fine.

571
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:22,030
Why? I should apply
some ointment on here too...

572
00:59:22,429 --> 00:59:23,599
I said it was fine.

573
00:59:27,739 --> 00:59:31,309
Next time,
I will apply the ointment myself.

574
00:59:31,309 --> 00:59:32,469
You can leave it here.

575
00:59:32,909 --> 00:59:35,840
- Still, I should help you apply...
- I can do it myself!

576
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,309
Also,

577
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,349
you say that things have
always been like this between us?

578
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,150
I do not want to hear it.

579
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,719
And you keep touching me.

580
00:59:45,019 --> 00:59:46,960
Then, I... You know?

581
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,820
I am also...

582
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:51,960
Anyway! Do not ever...

583
00:59:56,969 --> 00:59:57,969
So...

584
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:04,739
Well, that is not...

585
01:00:05,539 --> 01:00:06,670
what I meant.

586
01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:24,750
Did you perhaps act
upon the Crown Prince's orders?

587
01:01:34,199 --> 01:01:35,230
My lord.

588
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:42,500
I hope...

589
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:49,239
I did not do anything too silly.

590
01:01:55,949 --> 01:01:57,119
My lord.

591
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:16,170
I am sorry.

592
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:21,010
It took too long, did it not?

593
01:02:21,909 --> 01:02:23,179
I am truly sorry.

594
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:07,659
(My Dearest)

595
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:57,840
I believe you took care of the captives...

596
01:03:57,869 --> 01:03:59,539
that were locked up.

597
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:01,940
This man is not Gu Yang Chun.

598
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:03,639
It was Lee Jang Hyun, the interpreter.

599
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:05,110
Then what happened to that scoundrel?

600
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:07,650
Is he alive or dead?

601
01:04:07,849 --> 01:04:10,750
Jang Hyun, you are the only person
I can trust...

602
01:04:10,849 --> 01:04:11,889
to do this.

603
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,449
Qing...

604
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:15,059
requested Lee Jang Hyun
as their interpreter.

605
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:17,019
Everyone is looking for you.

606
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:19,159
And you wish to go to the palace?

607
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:24,420
