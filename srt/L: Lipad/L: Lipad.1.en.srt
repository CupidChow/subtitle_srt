1
00:02:27,227 --> 00:02:30,732
The taxi driver told me earlier,

2
00:02:30,756 --> 00:02:33,568
“There are so many people in hell now,

3
00:02:33,592 --> 00:02:37,280
the heat’s beginning to be felt on Earth!”

4
00:02:37,304 --> 00:02:41,804
Hey, you down there in hell,

5
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,745
you better be ready!

6
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:45,544
There are still a lot coming your way.

7
00:02:45,568 --> 00:02:46,822
We might not fit in there…

8
00:02:47,654 --> 00:02:48,978
wait, don't count me in.

9
00:02:52,027 --> 00:02:53,505
Let’s all be safe, everyone.

10
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,355
Folks, heat stroke is no joke!

11
00:02:56,734 --> 00:02:58,325
The weather’s completely different now,

12
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,452
not just here in the Philippines,

13
00:02:59,476 --> 00:03:01,102
but all over the world.

14
00:03:01,276 --> 00:03:04,088
Believe it or not,
climate change is real!

15
00:03:04,206 --> 00:03:06,250
Just like how a song goes,

16
00:03:07,561 --> 00:03:10,255
“Oh King Sun, you're blazing so hard,

17
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:12,756
you're burning up my soul.”

18
00:03:13,942 --> 00:03:15,049
Alright.

19
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,094
Let's stay hydrated everyone...

20
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:19,609
If only we could all
show up to work naked

21
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:20,764
to beat the heat...

22
00:03:21,003 --> 00:03:22,902
But of course, that’s not allowed.

23
00:03:24,686 --> 00:03:27,772
It is now 8:30 in the morning!

24
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,069
Here are some messages from netizens

25
00:03:34,094 --> 00:03:37,823
about this crazy
heat we’re all feeling!

26
00:03:39,074 --> 00:03:41,241
From user Punani23:

27
00:03:41,265 --> 00:03:45,653
I just saw Satan buying ice earlier!

28
00:03:47,826 --> 00:03:50,329
You guys online are hilarious…

29
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,707
Damn, where the hell is this girl going?

30
00:06:04,636 --> 00:06:07,515
For now, while we’re drenched in sweat,

31
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,562
it’s only a few more weeks before

32
00:06:12,586 --> 00:06:16,274
the so-called wet season kicks in.

33
00:06:16,523 --> 00:06:19,772
Ma’am, I’ve already got
the aircon on full blast.

34
00:06:20,442 --> 00:06:22,161
But with that outfit, Ma’am,

35
00:06:22,185 --> 00:06:24,213
not even the aircon can keep up.

36
00:06:24,406 --> 00:06:26,046
So, are we going straight to the airport?

37
00:06:26,664 --> 00:06:29,500
No, just straight ahead.

38
00:06:29,558 --> 00:06:33,024
[radio chatter in the background]

39
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:34,640
Uh, so… where are we headed?

40
00:06:34,664 --> 00:06:37,455
Remember, he loves you.

41
00:06:39,022 --> 00:06:42,205
Turn off your radio and
just keep going straight.

42
00:07:12,555 --> 00:07:13,663
What the hell?

43
00:07:14,548 --> 00:07:15,548
Relax!

44
00:08:35,377 --> 00:08:36,760
That’s three thousand.

45
00:08:38,006 --> 00:08:40,867
I’ll just settle whatever
the meter says later.

46
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,865
That should be enough, right?

47
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:48,925
Uhm, Ma’am… where
exactly are we going?

48
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:52,140
We might end up all
the way in Tuguegarao,

49
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,177
this won’t be enough.

50
00:08:53,202 --> 00:08:56,630
Don’t worry, we
won't reach the moon.

51
00:08:56,655 --> 00:08:58,755
I know a way there, Ma’am,

52
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,645
this taxi can fly.

53
00:09:00,986 --> 00:09:03,005
Alright, then let’s go…

54
00:09:04,676 --> 00:09:05,848
I want to fly.

55
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:08,441
Okay, let’s go, Ma’am…

56
00:09:08,512 --> 00:09:09,918
To the moon it is.

57
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,829
Julia was Lance's ex.

58
00:10:02,189 --> 00:10:06,362
Like us, she came
from a broken family.

59
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,653
She and her siblings
were separated.

60
00:10:27,392 --> 00:10:31,645
She ended up living
with her aunt, Aunt Natty.

61
00:11:11,553 --> 00:11:15,456
From then on, Aunt Natty
took care of Julia.

62
00:11:29,737 --> 00:11:31,843
Aunt Natty had only one boyfriend…

63
00:11:31,868 --> 00:11:34,538
who died in an accident.

64
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:37,856
After that, she never loved again.

65
00:11:38,728 --> 00:11:41,812
Julia's happy with her aunt.

66
00:11:41,837 --> 00:11:43,780
“They’re like friends,”

67
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:46,549
Lance would often tell me about them.

68
00:12:28,433 --> 00:12:30,226
Aunt Natty was kind to Lance too.

69
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:33,060
She wanted her niece
to end up with him.

70
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:12,389
But even she couldn’t

71
00:13:12,413 --> 00:13:14,943
escape Lance’s fantasies.

72
00:15:24,838 --> 00:15:26,507
Damn it!

73
00:15:26,896 --> 00:15:29,080
This guy's going to... Shit!

74
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,295
Sorry, Ma’am,

75
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:33,706
just buckle up, alright?

76
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,312
Lala.

77
00:15:38,248 --> 00:15:39,570
My name is Lala.

78
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,235
Lennon, Ma’am…

79
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,299
I can’t play guitar,

80
00:15:43,324 --> 00:15:44,585
I can’t sing either,

81
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,539
but that's my name.

82
00:15:47,328 --> 00:15:48,404
And sorry about that.

83
00:15:56,295 --> 00:15:57,695
Are you sure you don’t want to eat?

84
00:15:59,753 --> 00:16:02,159
- I'm good. I’ve no appetite.
- Coffee?

85
00:16:02,632 --> 00:16:04,328
They’ve got some there.
I’ll buy you one.

86
00:16:04,522 --> 00:16:05,807
Go ahead and eat.

87
00:16:06,861 --> 00:16:09,447
We’ve still got a long trip ahead.

88
00:16:09,504 --> 00:16:11,192
I actually haven’t slept yet.

89
00:16:11,383 --> 00:16:13,219
When I saw you earlier,

90
00:16:13,244 --> 00:16:14,296
I thought,

91
00:16:14,423 --> 00:16:15,724
I’d drop off this lady first

92
00:16:15,748 --> 00:16:17,047
before I hit the garage.

93
00:16:17,613 --> 00:16:20,455
But your offer’s so
good that I thought,

94
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,532
I’d just catch up on sleep later tonight.

95
00:16:24,524 --> 00:16:26,045
Hope you’ve figured out

96
00:16:26,157 --> 00:16:28,739
where we’re going.

97
00:16:31,654 --> 00:16:32,681
You know,

98
00:16:32,706 --> 00:16:34,943
I worked at that
cafeteria for a long time.

99
00:16:35,558 --> 00:16:37,456
That’s why I always eat here.

100
00:16:37,794 --> 00:16:41,148
Sometimes they
give me extra food

101
00:16:41,172 --> 00:16:42,743
because they know me.

102
00:16:43,287 --> 00:16:44,769
You worked here
as a young helper?

103
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:45,794
Yeah,

104
00:16:45,819 --> 00:16:47,830
I stopped going to school at that time.

105
00:16:47,886 --> 00:16:49,581
I wasn’t even learning anything anyway.

106
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:51,795
It's just a waste of money,

107
00:16:52,131 --> 00:16:54,426
my mom cannot give
me an allowance either.

108
00:16:55,456 --> 00:16:57,012
Don’t you want to
go back to school?

109
00:16:58,543 --> 00:17:00,508
Me, at this age? No way.

110
00:17:01,618 --> 00:17:06,864
Supporting my wife and
kids was really tough.

111
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,794
Taxi drivers aren’t making
much money these days.

112
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:18,684
You know, I also have a story
about a young helper.

113
00:17:19,202 --> 00:17:21,801
There… story time!

114
00:17:22,147 --> 00:17:24,400
That’s the secret
to staying awake.

115
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,217
It took me a while to do

116
00:17:34,242 --> 00:17:35,525
what Lance wanted me to.

117
00:17:36,653 --> 00:17:39,315
I didn’t get him at first.

118
00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:41,075
But Lance was patient,

119
00:17:41,864 --> 00:17:43,485
and didn’t give up until

120
00:17:43,509 --> 00:17:45,129
I started liking it too.

121
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:48,461
This was the first
time I gave in to him.

122
00:18:07,942 --> 00:18:10,279
Ma’am, I’m the
helper from next door.

123
00:18:10,652 --> 00:18:12,864
Sir Lance said he
wants to give me

124
00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:14,926
some of his old clothes.

125
00:18:17,261 --> 00:18:18,561
I know you.

126
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,939
Come in.

127
00:18:21,862 --> 00:18:24,407
Uh… I’m shy, I’d rather not go in.

128
00:18:25,242 --> 00:18:27,620
No worries, the clothes are just here.

129
00:18:39,162 --> 00:18:40,663
Come.

130
00:18:56,931 --> 00:18:57,998
Ma'am!

131
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:05,713
Sir Lance might wake up.

132
00:19:10,923 --> 00:19:13,159
Ma’am, Sir might wake up.

133
00:19:13,858 --> 00:19:15,260
He won't.

134
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:22,776
He’s got a gun,

135
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,027
so don’t make any noise.

136
00:19:26,052 --> 00:19:27,387
Just stand right there.

137
00:19:27,678 --> 00:19:30,486
He’ll get mad if you resist.

138
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:44,045
It feels amazing to see
your loved one happy.

139
00:20:44,141 --> 00:20:45,572
It’s kind of addictive…

140
00:20:45,934 --> 00:20:47,958
you just can’t get enough of that feeling.

141
00:20:48,503 --> 00:20:50,053
Even if you try not to…

142
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,539
the smell,

143
00:20:51,721 --> 00:20:52,860
the taste,

144
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,274
the feel…

145
00:20:54,893 --> 00:20:56,621
It slowly starts to feel good…

146
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,016
you’ll find yourself wanting it.

147
00:21:04,452 --> 00:21:06,513
Where did you meet that Lance guy?

148
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:07,966
Is he Filipino?

149
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,370
I thought only foreigners

150
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:12,795
are into those kinds of things.

151
00:21:17,646 --> 00:21:19,791
Lance was born in America.

152
00:21:20,374 --> 00:21:22,878
But when his parents split,

153
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:25,310
his dad brought him here...

154
00:21:25,928 --> 00:21:27,544
He left him and never came back,

155
00:21:28,327 --> 00:21:30,372
so his mom went with
some American guy.

156
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,357
Lance hates his mom.

157
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:36,477
I met him at the call center.

158
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,944
We worked together,

159
00:21:39,535 --> 00:21:41,452
and I was the only friend he had there…

160
00:21:42,142 --> 00:21:43,419
Lance is something else.

161
00:21:44,327 --> 00:21:45,705
I'm from Tarlac.

162
00:21:46,174 --> 00:21:47,955
My dad used to be a soldier,

163
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,007
so it was like martial law at home.

164
00:21:50,662 --> 00:21:53,042
I couldn’t take it and ran away.

165
00:21:54,005 --> 00:21:56,271
I only made it to second year in nursing.

166
00:21:57,038 --> 00:21:58,465
I had boyfriends before,

167
00:21:58,489 --> 00:22:00,884
but I was only serious about Lance.

168
00:22:01,707 --> 00:22:03,470
He was different from the rest.

169
00:22:05,463 --> 00:22:06,810
We’re from Sta. Mesa.

170
00:22:07,015 --> 00:22:08,282
I’m a real Manila boy,

171
00:22:08,307 --> 00:22:09,401
no provincial roots.

172
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:10,946
We used to have a store.

173
00:22:11,211 --> 00:22:12,697
There are four of us siblings.

174
00:22:13,987 --> 00:22:16,156
After our parents passed,

175
00:22:16,356 --> 00:22:18,025
my siblings fought over

176
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,792
who would get the store.

177
00:22:20,858 --> 00:22:23,272
I stayed out of it.

178
00:22:23,982 --> 00:22:25,384
I’d had enough of the fighting.

179
00:22:26,171 --> 00:22:27,673
I just wanted a peaceful life.

180
00:22:28,245 --> 00:22:30,406
My wife and kids are
more important to me

181
00:22:30,608 --> 00:22:32,194
than my siblings.

182
00:22:39,188 --> 00:22:41,941
Uhm, Ma’am, is there a term for

183
00:22:41,965 --> 00:22:44,355
what Lance make you do?

184
00:22:45,343 --> 00:22:46,521
Cuckold.

185
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:48,809
It means

186
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:52,674
having your partner watch you

187
00:22:52,699 --> 00:22:54,450
while you’re having sex.

188
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,151
People like that must have

189
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:58,721
some kind of mental issue, huh?

190
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:00,227
Maybe.

191
00:23:00,557 --> 00:23:01,817
I don’t know.

192
00:23:02,351 --> 00:23:03,712
Better ask a doctor.

193
00:23:04,825 --> 00:23:06,740
Lots of people around us

194
00:23:06,765 --> 00:23:08,175
probably have secrets like that.

195
00:23:08,545 --> 00:23:11,479
Could be a relative or a friend

196
00:23:11,504 --> 00:23:14,118
has those kinds of fantasies.

197
00:23:15,601 --> 00:23:17,395
So that’s a thing?

198
00:23:17,593 --> 00:23:19,113
Because I’m only hearing about it now.

199
00:23:21,017 --> 00:23:23,795
It’s fine as long as
no one’s being forced.

200
00:23:24,048 --> 00:23:26,127
But, Ma’am, Lance forced you.

201
00:23:26,517 --> 00:23:29,134
And you ended up forcing
the neighbor’s helper.

202
00:23:31,496 --> 00:23:33,916
I don’t want to lose Lance.

203
00:24:23,109 --> 00:24:27,114
At first, I got jealous

204
00:24:27,501 --> 00:24:29,366
because I kept hearing
Lance talk about Julia.

205
00:24:55,182 --> 00:24:56,935
Eventually,

206
00:24:57,592 --> 00:25:00,894
I realized I wasn’t supposed
to be jealous of Julia…

207
00:25:01,221 --> 00:25:03,057
it should've been Aunt Natty.

208
00:28:38,066 --> 00:28:39,066
Julia?

209
00:28:42,614 --> 00:28:43,753
Julia!

210
00:28:47,448 --> 00:28:49,020
Uh... Ma'am.

211
00:28:50,113 --> 00:28:51,615
I’ve got fantasies too.

212
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:55,411
- What is it?
- I, uh... I want...

213
00:28:56,352 --> 00:28:57,498
Two at the same time.

214
00:28:57,523 --> 00:28:59,285
Both celebs.

215
00:29:01,874 --> 00:29:03,442
Just a fantasy, Ma'am.

216
00:29:23,617 --> 00:29:24,910
Is she there?

217
00:29:34,378 --> 00:29:35,588
Stay there.

218
00:29:37,523 --> 00:29:39,175
I’ll just check this real quick, bro.

219
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:51,528
Hey Bro, film this for me, okay?

220
00:37:28,643 --> 00:37:29,651
Hello?

221
00:37:31,108 --> 00:37:34,900
Yeah, I’m not coming home till tonight.

222
00:37:34,925 --> 00:37:37,544
Someone hired me
and the pay's good.

223
00:37:38,246 --> 00:37:40,373
Yes, all good.

224
00:37:42,145 --> 00:37:43,218
What?

225
00:37:43,243 --> 00:37:44,430
Yeah, okay,

226
00:37:44,455 --> 00:37:45,693
I’ll grab it on my way home.

227
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,486
Alright,

228
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,047
okay.

229
00:37:49,107 --> 00:37:50,187
Love you!

230
00:37:51,549 --> 00:37:52,588
Bye.

231
00:38:07,004 --> 00:38:08,465
You jerked off, didn’t you?

232
00:38:53,305 --> 00:39:08,414
[murmuring]

233
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:12,660
Did you cum?

234
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:16,873
Mhm, three times.

235
00:39:17,983 --> 00:39:18,983
Three...

236
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,230
Just three?

237
00:39:30,605 --> 00:39:32,145
Let's add more to that.

238
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,223
- I'm close.
- Okay...

239
00:39:46,054 --> 00:39:47,054
Wow.

240
00:39:47,324 --> 00:39:48,576
Damn, she came really fast.

241
00:39:49,726 --> 00:39:50,818
Did she?

242
00:39:50,851 --> 00:39:51,914
Yeah…

243
00:39:52,877 --> 00:39:55,014
She’s probably really horny too.

244
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:58,713
She came faster than me?

245
00:40:00,587 --> 00:40:03,127
No, you’re still faster.

246
00:40:03,992 --> 00:40:05,010
But…

247
00:40:06,389 --> 00:40:07,447
But what?

248
00:40:07,945 --> 00:40:10,103
Come on, finish it…

249
00:40:10,128 --> 00:40:11,764
What is it? Tell me.

250
00:40:12,157 --> 00:40:14,324
- What? Tell me!
- But...

251
00:40:14,392 --> 00:40:16,770
But… it feels different with a woman.

252
00:40:18,407 --> 00:40:19,471
Feels good?

253
00:40:19,496 --> 00:40:21,518
Yes, it does.

254
00:40:23,483 --> 00:40:24,529
Really?

255
00:40:24,554 --> 00:40:25,605
Yeah.

256
00:40:27,549 --> 00:40:28,666
Lance…

257
00:40:29,395 --> 00:40:30,447
it feels amazing.

258
00:40:31,076 --> 00:40:32,287
Then you should do it again.

259
00:40:33,354 --> 00:40:35,080
You’ve learned a lot.

260
00:40:41,336 --> 00:40:42,713
What else did she tell you?

261
00:40:44,965 --> 00:40:46,751
She even told me…

262
00:40:47,499 --> 00:40:49,361
to suck her tits.

263
00:40:51,221 --> 00:40:52,765
She taught me how.

264
00:40:53,276 --> 00:40:55,267
- How to suck her nipples?
- Yeah.

265
00:40:57,265 --> 00:40:58,671
Did you make her come?

266
00:41:03,733 --> 00:41:05,399
She took my finger…

267
00:41:05,837 --> 00:41:10,131
then guided it inside her.

268
00:41:11,874 --> 00:41:15,397
- Ah, that’s it…
- She was so wet…

269
00:41:15,422 --> 00:41:16,422
How wet?

270
00:41:18,011 --> 00:41:19,217
Dripping wet.

271
00:41:20,954 --> 00:41:22,365
Wetter than you were?

272
00:41:23,765 --> 00:41:25,344
- Hmm?
- Yes.

273
00:41:25,369 --> 00:41:26,675
She was wet.

274
00:41:43,332 --> 00:41:44,332
Go on.

275
00:41:51,093 --> 00:41:52,295
Push it harder.

276
00:42:17,949 --> 00:42:19,659
We're so wet.

277
00:42:21,874 --> 00:42:22,874
And then?

278
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,272
What else did she tell you?

279
00:42:25,537 --> 00:42:27,408
We both came,

280
00:42:29,329 --> 00:42:31,234
it was a really intense
and powerful orgasm.

281
00:42:31,301 --> 00:42:32,301
Was it good?

282
00:42:33,131 --> 00:42:35,008
- Did it feel good?
- Yes.

283
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,260
What else?

284
00:42:37,866 --> 00:42:38,913
Tell me more.

285
00:42:39,737 --> 00:42:45,273
She taught me how
to go down on her.

286
00:42:47,342 --> 00:42:48,485
You liked it?

287
00:42:49,756 --> 00:42:51,131
Yes, I did.

288
00:42:52,273 --> 00:42:53,279
Really?

289
00:42:53,508 --> 00:42:54,968
Yeah, Lance… it feels amazing.

290
00:42:59,131 --> 00:43:00,131
What else?

291
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:03,858
Do you do drugs, Lennon?

292
00:43:04,435 --> 00:43:07,868
I tried meth once.

293
00:43:07,893 --> 00:43:09,075
I didn’t like it.

294
00:43:10,262 --> 00:43:12,614
Why? Do you use drugs?

295
00:43:14,911 --> 00:43:15,911
No.

296
00:43:17,044 --> 00:43:21,724
Both Lance and I don’t like drugs either.

297
00:43:36,803 --> 00:43:38,513
Lance doesn’t do drugs.

298
00:43:44,983 --> 00:43:47,895
You okay, Ma'am Lala?

299
00:43:48,336 --> 00:43:52,164
Looks like you’re catching a cold.

300
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:03,967
You know ma’am, this is
the first time I’ve met

301
00:44:03,992 --> 00:44:05,709
a passenger like you.

302
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:08,705
Paying extra just to get stuck

303
00:44:09,068 --> 00:44:12,378
and suffer in this traffic.

304
00:44:12,705 --> 00:44:13,874
Remember, you're paid.

305
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,632
I know, Ma'am.

306
00:44:16,707 --> 00:44:18,343
You can’t complain.

307
00:44:18,905 --> 00:44:19,949
Not allowed.

308
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,736
It’s just tiring, Ma’am,

309
00:44:22,852 --> 00:44:25,039
not knowing where you’re headed.

310
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:30,552
You think I’m worth
what you paid me?

311
00:44:31,404 --> 00:44:34,116
Don't worry about it, Lennon.

312
00:44:35,308 --> 00:44:38,557
I’ll tell my kids about
this when I’m old.

313
00:44:39,503 --> 00:44:41,363
The story of the woman

314
00:44:41,388 --> 00:44:44,342
who wanted to go to the moon.

315
00:44:47,065 --> 00:44:48,801
I’ll get there soon.

316
00:46:02,008 --> 00:46:03,008
[groans]

317
00:46:04,646 --> 00:46:06,212
Sorry... Sorry.

318
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,317
What the hell?
Why'd you have to bite me?

319
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:09,893
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

320
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:11,315
Sorry... Sorry.

321
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,884
What the hell?

322
00:46:16,186 --> 00:46:17,186
Stop!

323
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,232
Leave it, don’t touch.

324
00:46:23,112 --> 00:46:24,656
Sorry.

325
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,440
Let's go.

326
00:48:08,284 --> 00:48:09,414
Go for a swim.

327
00:48:10,628 --> 00:48:11,628
Huh?

328
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:14,331
I said, go swim.

329
00:52:12,774 --> 00:52:13,970
Ma’am Lala,

330
00:52:16,483 --> 00:52:20,392
at least keep a bit of self-respect.

331
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:23,662
That Lance is such a jerk.

332
00:52:27,261 --> 00:52:29,823
I was already feeling sick

333
00:52:30,835 --> 00:52:32,338
and dizzy from the trip,

334
00:52:33,172 --> 00:52:34,758
and I begged him to stop.

335
00:52:35,856 --> 00:52:37,455
He just wouldn't.

336
00:52:39,014 --> 00:52:40,370
He won’t talk about the things

337
00:52:40,395 --> 00:52:42,114
that actually matters.

338
00:52:46,334 --> 00:52:48,170
That’s how our house in Tarlac is.

339
00:52:49,449 --> 00:52:50,844
Looks nice on the outside,

340
00:52:51,852 --> 00:52:53,396
rotten on the inside.

341
00:52:56,616 --> 00:53:00,538
A house will rot if
the roof’s broken.

342
00:53:02,947 --> 00:53:04,700
I know a good roofer.

343
00:53:05,671 --> 00:53:07,257
Want me to give you his number?

344
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:09,210
Never mind,

345
00:53:10,005 --> 00:53:11,467
just stay quiet.

346
00:53:26,897 --> 00:53:29,539
Separate what needs to be separated.

347
00:53:54,462 --> 00:53:55,798
Hey,

348
00:53:58,241 --> 00:54:00,035
I’m the one paying for
your place, remember?

349
00:54:01,477 --> 00:54:03,871
I even pay your damn bills.

350
00:54:05,344 --> 00:54:06,998
You see me complaining?

351
00:54:10,645 --> 00:54:13,482
This isn’t about money.

352
00:54:21,697 --> 00:54:23,080
So what do you want then?

353
00:54:24,992 --> 00:54:26,369
Can we just be normal?

354
00:54:30,706 --> 00:54:33,008
I just want that.

355
00:54:33,378 --> 00:54:35,988
You and me. Just the two of us.

356
00:54:36,013 --> 00:54:37,123
That’s all I want, Lance…

357
00:54:37,147 --> 00:54:38,699
can’t we have that?

358
00:54:43,622 --> 00:54:46,812
We’ve already started this, right?

359
00:54:49,007 --> 00:54:52,759
You know what I want.
You know that.

360
00:54:54,183 --> 00:54:56,311
Look, we’ll get tired of this eventually.

361
00:54:57,535 --> 00:55:00,776
Can’t we just enjoy it for now?

362
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,139
Please?

363
00:55:15,334 --> 00:55:17,357
You’re the only one enjoying this, Lance.

364
00:57:46,694 --> 00:57:49,489
Sir, I’m not trying to act smart.

365
00:57:49,513 --> 00:57:50,874
I just know.

366
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,243
I didn’t violate anything,

367
00:57:53,268 --> 00:57:54,370
and you know that too.

368
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:56,905
Would I stop you if there wasn’t?

369
00:57:57,282 --> 00:57:58,663
There is.

370
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,496
Come on, Bro,

371
00:58:01,208 --> 00:58:03,544
if you just need
money for snacks,

372
00:58:03,569 --> 00:58:05,130
don’t take it out on me.

373
00:58:05,606 --> 00:58:07,150
You're disgusting.

374
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,092
I’ll press charges.

375
00:58:10,009 --> 00:58:11,637
Shame on you.

376
00:58:12,404 --> 00:58:13,656
Hand me your license.

377
00:58:14,094 --> 00:58:15,471
And why would I give it to you?

378
00:58:16,708 --> 00:58:19,077
Is one thousand enough?

379
00:58:20,072 --> 00:58:21,958
Ma’am, if you end up late,

380
00:58:23,439 --> 00:58:25,223
it’s the taxi driver’s fault.

381
00:58:25,408 --> 00:58:26,830
I'll let you suck my tits.

382
00:58:33,157 --> 00:58:34,199
Get lost.

383
00:58:34,558 --> 00:58:36,338
Asshole driver,

384
00:58:36,766 --> 00:58:38,185
messed-up passenger.

385
01:02:50,616 --> 01:02:52,413
I envy her.

386
01:02:53,257 --> 01:02:55,539
I wish I had Julia’s guts.

387
01:02:56,102 --> 01:02:58,990
I wish I could fight like she does.

388
01:02:59,758 --> 01:03:03,026
She wasn’t scared
of losing Lance.

389
01:03:25,397 --> 01:03:27,275
Your hangout’s pretty far.

390
01:03:32,915 --> 01:03:34,676
I love Lance so much.

391
01:03:40,308 --> 01:03:41,348
I know.

392
01:03:47,523 --> 01:03:48,523
Are you okay?

393
01:03:56,324 --> 01:03:57,967
Stay there. Don't leave.

394
01:03:57,992 --> 01:03:59,036
Where are you going?

395
01:04:00,696 --> 01:04:01,823
Just stay there.

396
01:04:27,502 --> 01:04:28,600
Come.

397
01:04:30,121 --> 01:04:31,577
I want to fly.

398
01:05:48,592 --> 01:05:49,677
He’s here…

399
01:05:51,449 --> 01:05:52,449
Yes.

400
01:05:52,804 --> 01:05:54,055
He followed me…

401
01:05:56,277 --> 01:05:57,987
What do you want me to do?

402
01:06:04,358 --> 01:06:05,944
Lance wants to talk to you.

403
01:06:07,245 --> 01:06:08,789
He has something to say…

404
01:06:10,131 --> 01:06:11,143
Lennon,

405
01:06:12,184 --> 01:06:13,658
he came back to me…

406
01:06:18,622 --> 01:06:19,622
Come on,

407
01:06:21,531 --> 01:06:23,117
let’s do what he wants.

408
01:06:24,083 --> 01:06:25,153
Lennon…

409
01:06:26,336 --> 01:06:27,336
Come.

410
01:06:31,701 --> 01:06:32,718
No.

411
01:06:37,534 --> 01:06:38,556
I don't want to.

412
01:07:57,637 --> 01:07:58,637
Wait…

413
01:07:59,527 --> 01:08:01,280
what if Lance isn’t even real?

414
01:08:02,583 --> 01:08:04,769
What if Lance is just
something Lala made up…

415
01:08:04,794 --> 01:08:07,078
her imaginary boyfriend?

416
01:08:14,992 --> 01:08:16,058
I’m done.

417
01:08:16,539 --> 01:08:17,833
You guys handle it,

418
01:08:18,373 --> 01:08:19,920
I’m going to sleep.
