00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,420
<i>[AG-3]</i>

2
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,120
Hi, AG-3.

3
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,630
I love you, Master. What would you like?

4
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,180
Okay.

5
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,330
- Come home.
- Yes, Master.

6
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,660
- Wow.
- It's a remote control system.

7
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,100
Baton requested it.

8
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,470
- So... did you sleep well?
- Yes, Master.

9
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,610
What do you mean you slept? I bet you were just charging up your batteries.

10
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,050
So how's the weather today?

11
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,940
Today's weather will be sunny.

12
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,810
The highest temperature today will be 5 degrees Celsius so it's a nice day to go out.

13
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:36,700
- KOSPI?
- Today's Korea Composite Stock Price Index is 2530.67.

14
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,180
It's 1.87 points lower than yesterday's.

15
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,070
I suggest that you hold onto the blue chips and sell off part of the stocks that you have.

16
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,620
Very convenient indeed.

17
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,640
The sunlight is very nice.

18
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,910
So how about a walk in the park, Master?

19
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:55,040
What do you mean a walk? You need a scolding first.

20
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,320
AG-3, what was there before?

21
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,890
There was a castle made out of cards.

22
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,430
But I wonder why it's not there right now.

23
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,720
- You must have put it away, Master.
- Uh-huh.

24
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,320
I did put it away because there was a beagle that made a big old mess.

25
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,630
Should I rebuild it for you?

26
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:30,780
You? The amount of time it took me to build that card castle is 15 years.

27
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,300
Fifteen years?!

28
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,440
The one that I first built with my father when I was a kid,

29
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,600
I built upon it by myself until now.

30
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:19,850
So when you knocked it down, I was really mad, but

31
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,880
look.

32
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:34,300
This window happens to bring in a lot of sunlight.

33
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,820
I really love sitting beneath this window.

34
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,310
All this time, I kept thinking that it was dark.

35
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,770
But I never thought that it was because of those cards.

36
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:58,690
Make sure to input this face, this emotion.

37
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:05,330
AG-3, because you brought back sunshine into the remaining part of my life,

38
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:09,720
your master is very happy right now.

39
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:15,630
<i>Just continue to be your psychotic self. You're hard to get used to.</i>

40
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,600
And also...

41
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,870
Hey, when you're cleaning up, you should be well aware of your surroundings!

42
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,940
There are things here that are more expensive than you—
No, there aren't.

43
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,850
Oh. You're the most expensive.

44
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,030
Go and hide. Don't come outside no matter what you do, okay?

45
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:04,860
Yes, Ahjussi. Tell Doctor Hong and the other researchers to not come out of their building no matter what, okay?

46
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,390
What are you doing?! Hurry up and go hide already!

47
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,640
Yes. Yes, Master.

48
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,010
I came over to your house and played a lot back in the day, right?

49
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,850
Get to the point.

50
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,570
What's the reason you broke the contract anyway?

51
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,700
Let me hear the reason. I'm the CEO after all.

52
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,290
A CEO after all?

53
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,580
You should be glad that you weren't removed from your position.

54
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,670
So what's the reason?!

55
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:36,050
M&A is about buying something that's worth 10,000 won for 500 won then selling it for 5,000 won.

56
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,460
It's a waste of time if you buy something worth 1,000 won for 500 won and selling it for 600 won.

57
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,610
But it looks like you've been wasting time with Daeyang Shipbuilding.

58
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,850
- But there was no loss.
- We just earned enough to pay out.

59
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,470
After wasting and wasting more time.

60
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:52,550
Chairman Martin said that he will pay you double for the contract fees.

61
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,350
Are you still going to break the contract?

62
00:05:54,350 --> 00:06:00,860
The more you open your mouth, the more it seems that you don't deserve to be the CEO.

63
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,930
Hey! There's only so much I can take.

64
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:10,860
Don't. I never told you to endure.

65
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,500
Not even once.

66
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:32,370
AG-3, do you know who those two are?

67
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,910
The one on the left is President Hwang Do Won of KM Financial.

68
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,170
The one on the right is CEO Hwang Yoo Cheol of KM Financial.

69
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,760
- They are both known as gentlemen of the financial--
- Who said they are gentlemen?!

70
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,190
That's fake news, so delete it!

71
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,760
AG-3, make sure to input this in your head.

72
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,010
Those two men are the primary enemies of your master.

73
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,950
Out of my enemies, they're the main ones.

74
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,840
Why is that?

75
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,040
It's a long story so just input it in your head.

76
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,170
So if you ever run into them, hide no matter what.

77
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,740
Your face can't be shown to them. Make sure to hide very well.

78
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,510
But why?

79
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,830
Those two might know that you are a robot.

80
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,600
Then...

81
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,240
they might destroy you.

82
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,510
AG-3, do you know how to make drip coffee?

83
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,480
Of course, I do. I used to work at a cafe for three yea—

84
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,300
Two cups of coffee to the garden. We have a guest.

85
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,970
I think a new team leader will be appointed to Social Contributions.

86
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,920
CEO Hwang Yoo Cheol will be nominating a new face himself.

87
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,340
Wasting time again since I'm going to get rid of that team.

88
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,850
- Next.
- Next is regarding the issue that you gave instructions for last time.

89
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,920
The other day, President Hwang Do Won's corporate credit card was used at a hotel.

90
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,840
- So?
- Currently, Chairman Martin of Bold Group is staying at that hotel.

91
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,660
<i>Wait, why is my brother over there?</i>

92
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,490
Should I look into Chairman Martin as well?

93
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:23,920
<i>He should be in court right now, so why is he with that psychopath? Why?</i>

94
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,670
Bring it over.

95
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,400
Hey!

96
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,280
Hey, what are you doing? What's up with your hair?

97
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,250
It's because the wind keeps blowing.

98
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,230
Who is...?

99
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,500
It's AG-3, don't you know?

100
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,360
I didn't have a chance to see it last time.

101
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,360
You should say hello now that you've seen it properly.

102
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,280
AG-3, this is our company's investigation team leader, Jo Jin Bae.

103
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,220
Hello.

104
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,840
Ah, yes.

105
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,960
It has a familiar feeling so it does seem human.

106
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,520
Stay there.

107
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,310
<i>Ah... just let me to go inside.</i>

108
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:40,130
Have you found a way to sue CEO Jo?

109
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:43,210
No, because you told me it was fine last time.

110
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:48,880
I only said it was fine because there were other matters at hand. I didn't mean to drop it entirely.

111
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,010
I'm sorry, Chairman.

112
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:56,320
Do you think you'll be able to stay long in our company with that kind of performance?

113
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,730
I'm really sorry.

114
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,450
<i>No, why is my brother bowing his head down like that?</i>

115
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,410
When I go back, I'll look into the situation immediately.

116
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:07,320
<i>Stop it! Don't bow your head down to that jerk!</i>

117
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,050
No, it's fine. I have something to receive from her for now,

118
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,720
but if I don't get it, then proceed to sue her.

119
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,760
For now, just put it on hold.

120
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,680
Yes, Chairman.

121
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,150
Leave.

122
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,630
<i>Is there anyone inside?</i>

123
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,450
<i>There's something I need to get fixed.</i>

124
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,390
I should just...

125
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,960
Should I input Team Leader Jo Jin Bae as a friend or foe?

126
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,760
I'm still not sure. I'm in the middle of testing him. Put him into an uncategorized folder.

127
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,530
Why don't you know? I knew it the moment I saw him.

128
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:08,240
Really? Then, to you, what type of person is he?

129
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,630
Honest, hardworking, upright, and very sincere.

130
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,680
- That's right.
- What?

131
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,870
Someone also said exactly what you said.

132
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,690
Who?

133
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,040
Whether he's a spy or a white knight,
<i>[Re: Jo Jin Bae X-File Request]</i>

134
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,390
I have yet to identify this anonymous person.

135
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,320
However, that's what other people judge him as.

136
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,760
I don't know what type of person he will be around me.

137
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,980
Take off your clothes.

138
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,080
We're going out. Change into these clothes.

139
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,510
Hurry up.

140
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:48,300
I have to take my clothes off though.

141
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,370
Okay. Change.

142
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,420
You should leave, so I can change.

143
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,640
I'm going to help in case your arm might get dislocated while you're changing.

144
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,840
Please leave.

145
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,590
I saw everything already.

146
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,900
Sun Hye, everyone is gathered. Right?

147
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,940
I'm leaving now. Take good care of it.

148
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,770
Take the upcoming right.

149
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,720
Are you sure this is right? This doesn't seem right.

150
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,390
An accident happened 10 minutes ago, so we're taking a different route.

151
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:34,130
A detour will take more time. You should've asked me first.

152
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:37,340
It's a chronically congested area.

153
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,610
Are you getting mad at me right now?

154
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:47,620
In about 100 meters, take a right.

155
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,390
Right.

156
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,600
- This is the company.
- Oh my.

In a democracy, they have the right to voice their opinion.

Why are you siding with them? You should side with your master.

A righteous robot sides with justice.

168
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,530
The social contribution team leader embezzled money.
