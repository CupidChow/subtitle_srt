163
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:37,070
I really was the crazy psychopath.

164
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,010
<i>I don't laugh when I'm with others.</i>

165
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,280
<i>I want to come off as scary</i>

166
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,310
<i>so they won't dare to do anything to me.</i>

167
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,720
<i>Humans...</i>

168
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,570
<i>were doubly stabbing me in the back in my dream.</i>

169
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:01,080
He must have been painfully stabbed with a dagger.

170
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,410
His allergy is so severe, too.

171
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,640
I wonder what kind of allergy it is.

172
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:24,220
He looks like a person without anything to envy about in this world, but

173
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,530
it seems like his life isn't as easy as it looks.

174
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,270
<i>Take off your clothes.</i>

175
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,710
Could it be that this punk is a perverted psychopath?

176
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,360
You went out with Baton yesterday, right? But why didn't you tell me?!

177
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,880
I thought you were watching everything, of course.

178
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,110
No wonder it was quiet in my ears.

179
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,110
- He didn't do anything weird to you?
- What weird thing?

180
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,570
He didn't seem mentally sound.

181
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:55,340
He is normal! He is different than what you see on the surface.

182
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:59,480
He doesn't lie and he is unexpectedly a bit of a softie.

183
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,970
Why are you taking Baton's side suddenly?

184
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,670
Because he is my master. So, of course, I should take his side.

185
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,910
I am your master, okay?

186
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:11,350
You're ridiculous. Snap out of it! AG-3 is over there.

187
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:15,150
Anyway, don't thoughtlessly follow him next time.

188
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:17,900
And also don't mindlessly go inside of his bedroom, either!

189
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,750
And why do you leave him alone when he touches you?

190
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,830
Man, I'm getting scolded for the wrong things again.

191
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,700
I thought you would get mad at me for injecting him instead.

192
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,850
Yes, I'm talking about that shot. Are you a paramedic or what?!

193
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,240
Why did you inject him?

194
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,730
When an allergic reaction is severe, there's a possibility of death due to shock.

195
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,290
So what I did was something to be praised for.

196
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:38,430
And Doctor, that's not our problem right now.

197
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,780
<i>- Yes, Chairman.</i>
- That Team Leader Jo is

198
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,080
your elder brother? Oh my god!

199
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,350
It's oh my god for me, too.

200
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:50,930
If my brother catches me working this part-time job, he might actually faint since his lungs are in poor condition.

201
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,510
So help me not to get caught.

202
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,940
We can hack the surveillance camera. When your brother comes, we can see right away.

203
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,880
Oh, what a relief!

204
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,890
But where is Sister Pi?

205
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,350
I have to take the corset off.

206
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,710
What the heck is this?

207
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:17,490
- You want us to paint?
- All of this?

208
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,650
No.

209
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:22,430
Paint all of this side and continue all the way over there.

210
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,650
You have to paint over at least three times

211
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,180
for it to be very waterproof.

212
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,720
We're all living here together so think of this as your own home.

213
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,700
Do your best, okay?

214
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,950
You two take care of the paint job.

215
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:43,830
Sir! Sir!

216
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,670
I am busy so I must—

217
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:50,310
That's right! You can have those two men do the paint job.

218
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:55,120
And you should come and help me, pretty doctor.

219
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,200
When you go over to the storage room over there, there's no electricity.

220
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,760
I don't know the reason why though.

221
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,120
The house is very old, so there is so much work to be done.

222
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,750
But now I have all these young folks around me,

223
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:14,510
so I feel so confident about everything.

224
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,850
Oh, yes.

225
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,470
I feel like Hell's Gate has opened up before us.

226
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,500
The machine, the machine. We shouldn't have fixed the machine for him.

227
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,830
Don't you agree, Sunbae Hoktal?

228
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,170
Just take it off.

229
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:40,870
Are you messing with me now? How can I take this off by myself?

230
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,870
Do you want me to help you?

231
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,220
Don't look this way. Turn your head around!

232
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,780
I won't look, I won't!

233
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,980
- What are you doing?! Turn your head around!
- All right, I won't look! Gosh, all I did was put on a relief patch.

234
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,130
Are you done yet?!

235
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,390
Don't misunderstand here.

236
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,040
You are no longer a woman to me—

237
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,990
I'll be back tonight!

238
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,870
So empty.

239
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,280
That's so amazing! That's so crazy!

240
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,920
How is that crazy psycho your brother's boss?

241
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,580
And on top of that, you saved the life of that psychopath again?

242
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:29,030
There is some kind of cosmic energy that is gathering to connect you with that psychopath.

243
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,440
Don't you think?

244
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,500
No, you're wrong. That man has welcomed his flowery first love yesterday.

245
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,460
That man?

246
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:41,500
When did that crazy psychopath become "that man?"

247
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,430
Starting from today. With enlightenment of repentance.

248
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,330
Make a move on him then. You said he's a man.

249
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,770
First love is meant to be broken anyway.

250
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,420
- But I'm a robot.
- Who cares?

251
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,560
If he pursues you, saying that he likes you even though you're a robot,

252
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,220
then this would definitely be something beyond human and matter.

253
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,330
Some cosmic love that we all have to accept.

254
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,390
Are you making fun of me?

255
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:11,700
But hey, your ex boyfriend doesn't feel anything even if you are by his side?

256
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,350
No, he doesn't see me as a woman any longer.

257
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,660
He didn't have to tell you that.

258
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,360
That's more suspicious though.

259
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,150
Bad girl.

260
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,910
Who, me?

261
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,610
Not you, I'm talking about Jo Ji Ah.

262
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:33,380
Add a subject. Otherwise, there will be an input error.

263
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,170
Bad girl.

264
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,960
Are you talking about Jo Ji Ah?

265
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,850
No, I'm talking about you!

266
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,790
My goodness...

267
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,250
- Did you get all of the petitions?
- Yeah.

268
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:57,080
Excluding those who were involved in embezzlement, I got a total of three.

269
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,170
Thanks a lot. If I win in the final rounds,

270
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,010
I will set up your four insurances as a bonus.

271
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,400
But you were the one who told me that the petition won't work.

272
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,580
I did say that but...

273
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,910
Seeing him, there are some unique sides to him,

274
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:15,680
but he doesn't seem completely abnormal.

275
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,290
And I also think that ink incident is also my misunderstanding as well.

276
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:36,240
AG-3, come here.

277
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:48,930
Right. It left awhile ago.

278
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:52,350
The recovery was faster? By how much?

279
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:57,750
About one to two hours? But the recovery was definitely faster than usual.

280
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,610
That's probably an outlier or the reaction was weak.

281
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,760
No... One more second and I would have died.

282
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,540
But you didn't die.

283
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,780
Doctor!

284
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:11,860
- I'm leaving for England tomorrow for a conference. It'll be hard to answer calls right away.
- Whatever.

285
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:18,220
But it's really different than usual. I feel more clear after waking up, too.

286
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:24,150
♫ <i>Don't wrinkle up your face</i> ♫

287
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,280
Yes, Mast—

288
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,960
Are you crazy?!

289
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,210
Hello?

290
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,690
The necklace, I got it.

291
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:33,650
And?

292
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:40,460
That hammer you were holding in the photo back then. There's no way you shattered my necklace with that,

293
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,620
<i>and sent it in that condition. Right?</i>

294
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:47,650
If that's the case, tell me first so I can prepare my heart.

295
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,250
I told you I sent it.

296
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,980
- How?
- Well.

297
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,090
How can I believe that?

298
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:57,340
Just believe me. When someone makes their heart known to—

299
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,490
Why would you make your heart known to me? I'm not interested in you, CEO Jo.

300
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,760
Did I ask you to take interest?

301
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,170
Why are you getting angry? I'm just asking you to tell me the truth.

302
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:08,220
So I told you the truth. I sent it well.

303
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:12,820
So how am I supposed to trust that? Even a loan needs a guarantee.

304
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:17,590
Wait. I won't believe anything you say anyway.

305
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:20,410
So why do I keep responding to you on this call?

306
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:24,570
It's a waste of my precious time. I'm hanging up.

307
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:27,210
Hello— Hel— Hey, hey!

308
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,960
You're the one who called me, you psycho!

309
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,010
That psycho came back.

310
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:36,720
How is it that he has such a talent for making people go nuts?

311
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,570
I'm the crazy wench for thinking you were normal for a brief moment. I am!

312
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:46,620
I will make the final attack tomorrow with this.

313
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,110
- Will he fall for it?
- He's sick.

314
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:53,090
When someone's sick, they become open-minded and sentimental.

315
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:58,690
Right at that time, I swoop in with a hand-written letter filled with emotion.

316
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:03,310
Send it today and it'll arrive tomorrow. Leave it to me.

317
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,820
You're sure Jin Bae oppa's not onto you at all, right?

318
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:10,820
Of course. You know how my brother is. He only knows about studying so he's slow.

319
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,890
<i>It's a high-tech material.</i>

320
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:16,660
<i>It's used to fabricate helmets...</i>

321
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,400
<i>That face is definitely my little sister's.</i>

322
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,370
<i>In German?</i>

323
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:23,690
Flubber, a viscoelastic material that simultaneously has properties of...

324
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,490
Have you seen something like this before, Team Leader Jo?

325
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,230
No, what is this?

326
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,180
- It's a robot.
- A robot?

327
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:35,270
Yes, it seems like a human though, doesn't it? But it's a robot.

328
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:41,500
<i>Even if Baton is quite capable, it's very obvious that the son of the current president will win, don't you think?</i>

329
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:47,490
This video came in internally but I wasn't sure to which transaction it was linked.

330
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:51,220
I wanted to ask you if you knew anything.

331
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,610
No, I don't know at all.

332
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:04,550
If you find any information about this robot, please let me know.

333
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,640
Sure.

334
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:14,190
To tell you the truth, only you and I are aware that this robot exists.

335
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,490
Don't you think that was rash?

336
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:40,650
Min Kyu's words keep getting into my head.

337
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:44,460
But don't worry. I made sure that Team Leader Jo wouldn't be able to speak about it freely.

338
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,840
It seemed like Team Leader Jo doesn't have an idea about AG-3 though.

339
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,170
He doesn't have the look of being completely clueless about it either.

340
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:55,180
What about the tracking?

341
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,980
There.

342
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,970
Found you, sucker.

343
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:12,410
Help me look up a car.

344
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:15,630
Car owner. The car owner. Yes.

345
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,020
- My shoulders...
- An unknown caller.

346
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,170
I'm so busy so why would I take it.

347
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,670
<i>The person you have called is not answering...</i>

348
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:31,990
He's not answering, Uncle.

349
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:35,500
They are quite cautious. Expected of geniuses.

350
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,540
But we've got a trick up our sleeves.

351
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,560
Do you think they'll come?

352
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,040
They will definitely come.

353
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,010
Everyone comes when they hear that a package has arrived. I know from personal experience.

354
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:07,160
No. I meant her.

355
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:10,550
There they come.

356
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,050
Is that the part from Africa?

357
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:31,930
Strange, I told them to send it to the new address.

358
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:35,350
No, it's not the part. This is a freebie.

359
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:38,640
Yeah? I thought so.

360
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,120
One, two, three.

361
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,170
Follow them.

362
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,450
Follow them furtively.

363
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,190
Where did they go?

364
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:12,450
- Where did they go?
- You punk. Following them... You should have been closer.

365
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,620
- Over there? Nope.
- No, it's not.

366
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:27,070
<i>My father told me to marry you.</i>

367
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:35,190
<i>My answer was... Why not?</i>

368
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:44,610
<i>Although this is an arranged marriage, we should try going on dates. Right?</i>

369
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:47,420
<i>Let's go on just 3 dates.</i>

370
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:55,360
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

371
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,430
♫ <i>At the same time</i> ♫

372
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:05,410
<i>If I can confirm that I'm able to kiss you, then I'm down for this marriage.</i>

373
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:09,630
♫ <i>you and I</i> ♫

374
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,920
I'm going nuts.

375
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,040
I see you need a friend right now.

376
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:24,130
Friend, my butt.

377
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:28,050
Right, Lovely?

378
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,950
Yeah, it's not that I need a friend right now. I need someone to talk to.

379
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:45,830
Okay. That's the reason I'm going there.

380
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,860
My intuition is telling me that this human is definitely not normal.

381
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:56,920
But Jo Ji Ah says he's normal. His allergy is severe.

382
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:01,230
Is this why he has perverted psycho tendencies?

383
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:06,350
Should I send her there tomorrow, or not?

384
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,880
Wow. I can't lift my arm.

385
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,290
I can't move my neck.

386
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,750
He won't give us work tomorrow, too. Right?

387
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:19,100
Before we finish the development, I'll be half dead already.

388
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,300
At least we got some delicious kimchi stew.

389
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,600
Does it make sense that the three of us get paid with kimchi stew? Does it?

390
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,950
With our brains—

391
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,300
Take off your clothes so I can put on some salon pas.

392
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,800
Why did you take it from me?

393
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:39,030
I'm going to put it on for them.

394
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,990
Sure, whatever.

395
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:43,200
We'll put it on ourselves.

396
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,790
Yes, we'll do that.

397
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:14,490
What? What are they doing inside?

398
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,500
What do I do?

399
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:24,490
Sunbae Hoktal, don't make those kinds of noises. If someone heard, they'd think something rated-R was going on in here.

400
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:29,220
Seriously. I'm so ashamed with Ji Ah here.

401
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:35,410
Hey! Hey! Hey!

402
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,770
What the heck?

403
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:39,710
<i>Hey...</i>

404
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:43,390
They said she was charging her battery but it sounds like she's having a lot of fun.

405
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:46,980
My back! It hurts!

406
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:52,180
Stop laughing already. Otherwise, your bolt will probably fall out.

407
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:56,870
And you... You feel like laughing even though your master isn't around?

408
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:59,130
That ingrate robot!

409
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:02,800
<i> Don't make noises together. It's weirder when you do it together.</i>

410
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,660
I think I should go to the sauna.

411
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,960
I heard it from somewhere that swimming is good for muscle pain.

412
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,830
- Swimming?
- Swimming?

413
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,640
It eases pain.

414
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:17,560
But that light over there has been on for a while now. What is it?
