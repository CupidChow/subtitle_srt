1
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,500
Ji Ah, I've been peeling this continuously, but it just won't end.

2
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,150
You already peeled the skin off. Why are you trying to peel more?

3
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,600
Now you have to cut this in half and then into little pieces.

4
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,970
There's no egg!

5
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,710
Look in the other refrigerator next to it.

6
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,710
- I'll do it. Move out.
- No, I can do it.

7
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,420
This should be like—

8
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,260
Please move! You're confusing me.

9
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,810
I can do it.

10
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,650
- Watch the food.
- Hey this.

11
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,900
It's burning.

12
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,320
- Just move.
- That's not how you do it.

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,250
You're here?

14
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:15,140
They said they had something to tell you, so... Is it all right?

15
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,610
I think we will be done moving things out by tomorrow.

16
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:25,020
I asked if we could eat together for one last time since we won't have any reason to see each other in the future.

17
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,800
We made the food together today.

18
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,080
Make sure to clean everything well when you leave.

19
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,630
Since there's no reason to see each other again.

20
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,090
Oh. Okay.

21
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,490
We'll clean everything with bleach before we leave.

22
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,450
<i>I think we will be done moving things out by tomorrow.</i>

23
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:03,240
<i>I asked if we could eat together for one last time since we won't have any reason to see each other in the future.</i>

24
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,590
He said it so easily.

25
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,450
I mean, are those words that easy to say?

26
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,140
I can finally eat too now.

27
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,940
That's right.

28
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,560
Try this. I made it at home.

29
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,340
How is it?

30
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,070
It's delicious.

31
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,640
That must mean it's really delicious.

32
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,750
Since when did you start cooking?

33
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,920
It hasn't been that many days yet.

34
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,400
I think I ate too much.

35
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,490
Is it not good?

36
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,450
- Are you sure it's delicious?
- Yeah.

37
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:11,820
However, from now on, I'll be in charge of cooking.

38
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,390
Why? What is it?

39
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,200
- It's delicious. You should try some.
- I don't eat meat.

40
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,330
- Since when?
- Yeah, right.

41
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,390
- I don't think that was the case yesterday.
- Since when?

42
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,450
Just don't cook anymore. It's better for you to do it.

43
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,750
Is your body better, Brother?

44
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,070
It's getting better.

45
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,280
Since we're all sitting together like this,

46
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,410
it reminds me of the first day he invited us over.

47
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,020
I miss that. I miss that.

48
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,200
I don't remember when that was.

49
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,840
Kim Min Kyu invited people over for a meal together?

50
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,080
Ah, about that... You know when we told him we were going to take AG-3 away?

51
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,860
He got so scared that he made an obscene amount of food and invited us to try to persuade us.

52
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,360
What do you think he called us when we were with him at that time?

53
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,620
Researcher One.

54
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,380
- Two.
- Three.

55
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,350
It's not like he was talking about three strikes.

56
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,860
That's was a big step in your stand, Kim Min Kyu.

57
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,210
It's all because I told you to do so, right?

58
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,930
The food he made was really good.

59
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,260
It was extremely delicious.

60
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,050
So what if it was delicious? You ignored me.

61
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,680
♫ <i>I don’t wanna let you go away</i> ♫

62
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,270
We're giving Beetle to you as a present.

63
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,750
Why are you giving it to me?

64
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:33,120
No, it's just... We don't know when we will get to see each other again.

65
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,160
We might never see each other again, either.

66
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:41,820
When I was thinking about things, I realized that we received from you but we haven't really given you anything.

67
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:46,180
However, you have a lot of money and everything.

68
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:51,010
That's why we thought Beetle would be the best present to give you.

69
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,430
It can befriend Lovely, too.

70
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,190
We also upgraded it yesterday.

71
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,140
The battery life is longer and it has more facial expressions.

72
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:08,290
Although it won't be as good as AG-3, it will be able to keep you company when you're bored.

73
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:14,660
I'm really, really sorry, Brother.

74
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:27,290
When we leave, I hope you forget all the bad times and just remember the good times.

75
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,590
But if you don't even want that, you can forget everything.

76
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,650
I don't want it.

77
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,010
About what?

78
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:52,900
You don't want Beetle?

79
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,910
No, what am I supposed to do when it breaks down?

80
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,590
What should I do fix it? I don't know anything.

81
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,950
Do you want me to just throw it away at a junk shop or something?

82
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,760
Junk shop...

83
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:12,850
I think we're all done eating, so let's get up, Doctor.

84
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,260
Just stay here.

85
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,360
What?

86
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,520
I'm telling you to just stay here.

87
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,230
It's so cold, so why do you keep wanting to go out?

88
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,010
Just stay at my house.

89
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:42,020
It's really cold. I heard it has been the coldest weather of all time.

90
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,570
Then could you get me another bowl of rice, Ji Ah?

91
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:49,990
How about we have a can of beer, Brother?

92
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,460
I have another one of those we had that time. The purebred chicken. The one with a leg this big. The huge one.

93
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,530
You still have that?

94
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,970
You have chicken? It's not like you breed chicken.

95
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,140
Okay. Then,

96
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,860
- we should eat some of it.
- A chicken coop.

97
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,930
Do you breed chicken or what?

98
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,990
<i>I love you.</i>

99
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:30,010

<i>You do not exist as a living creature.</i>

104
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,530
<i>Hi, AG-3.</i>

105
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,430
<i>I'm currently on master mode.</i>

106
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,990
<i>- Friend mode?
- Did you call me?</i>

107
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,080
<i>It works. It's working.</i>

108
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,810
<i>We're friends now, AG-3.</i>

109
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,080
<i>No, that's not right. We're family. </i>

110
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,230
<i>Remember this, AG-3.</i>

111
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:12,510
<i>You will be able to live with humans as a friend and as family.</i>

112

<i>I am that kind of an existence?</i>

113
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:18,300
<i>That's right. So let's work well together.</i>

114
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,890
I'm sorry, AG-3.

115
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,980
I'm sorry, AG-3...

116
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,320
Sleep some more.

117
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,220
What is it?

118
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:00,700
I... like it when you're looking at me.

That's not it. I'm happy right now.

Kim Min Kyu. Input my face and my emotions right now.

When you're like this, I get upset.

That's right.

124
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,320
I'm sad.

160
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,790
Did your heart flutter?

161
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,180
Ah! You can't disturb the driver.

162
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,010
- Come back safely.
- I'll be back.

163
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,120
Welcome.

164
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,150
Hello, Kim Min Kyu.

165
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:50,350
Madam-X?

166
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:54,060
I came here after getting a message from Madam-X.

167
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:58,730
Chairman Martin is a criminal on Interpol's blacklist.

168
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,130
Murder, fraud, and instigating arson.

169
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,480
Although he committed countless crimes,

170
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,230
he was always freed as innocent because there wasn't enough evidence against him.

171
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,770
If Jang Doo Sam's recording has anything that deals with Chairman Martin,

172
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:17,450
we can contact Interpol and put him in a witness protection program.

173
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,720
We're just going to take a look once and then leave, okay?

174
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,750
Thank you, Uncle.

175
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,540
I won't leave until I see her.

176
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,150
I'll wait.

177
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,830
In this spot. I will see her no matter what.

178
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:38,290
- I w—
- I know. I already told you many times that I know again and again.

179
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,990
We're trying to see her right now.

180
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,430
How many times do you have to say it?

181
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,570
I'll wait.

182
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:53,290
It seems that Jang Doo Sam disappeared on the day Doctor Hong and I met him.

183
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:57,720
I sent a text, but I can't guarantee that he'll come.

184
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,820
You said two o'clock, right? There's not much time left.

185
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:21,590
However, since when did my younger sister get a job as your personal driver?

186
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:30,170
Uhm... That... I apologize.

187
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,440
Jang Doo Sam!

188
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,970
Please sit.

189
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,810
Just how are you going to keep me safe?

190
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:58,110
You'll be protected by Interpol's witness protection program.

191
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:04,220
Here. There is information along with where you can stay.

192
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:11,350
I know very well about how you have lived until now.

193
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:17,280
Without being able to trust anyone and always doubting whether or not the person in front of you is going to hurt you.

194
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,460
Not wanting to live like that, but not being able to see any other path.

195
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:27,270
I know very well what that feels like.

196
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,490
Please hold onto my hand, Jang Doo Sam.

197
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:35,180
I'll be that path for you.

198
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,630
This is Jang Doo Sam's recording that I told you about.

199
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,860
Would it be possible before 2 o'clock?

200
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,490
I beg that you take care of it well.

201
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,260
How did it go?

202
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,220
It was a success?

203
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:16,810
The only problem now is to get there before the signing ceremony.

204
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:25,250
Yes. I will call you immediately when I get there and find AG-3's location.

205
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,390
Don't worry. I'll get you there no matter what.

206
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,230

We will begin signing the contract for the sale of Daeyang Shipbuilding's R&D Team.

209
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,950
- Congratulations.
- And to you. Shall we?

President Martin?

211
00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:01,190
I'm afraid we cannot proceed the transaction of Team Santa Maria today.

212
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:08,020
Also, we are going to cancel all of our contracts with Bold Corporation.

213

Kim Min Kyu, everything's over already.

<i>We just arrived, Chairman.</i>

That's right. Everything's over... for you.

217
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:39,900
Hwang Do Won, you're under arrest for the murder of Daeyang Shipbuilding's Chairman Park Sung Jin.

218
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,530
- What are they saying?
- What's going on?
Murder?

219
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:46,200
I think you will have to come with us to the police station to give a statement.

220
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,000
Let go. We refuse to go anywhere.

221
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,610

- What is it?
- Martin came to take it, but AG-3 is missing.

227
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:23,930
Where in the world did AG-3 disappear?!

228
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,270
Yeah?

229
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:40,690

Those things that we discussed in front of the AG-3 last night.

<i> I killed that old bastard Park myself.</i>

239

We're gonna have to delete all of AG-3's data.

Make sure it's completely wiped! Are we clear on this?

241

If anything goes wrong, you'll be the one taking the fall!

242

<i>Some trees, I wanted to touch. </i>

249

Just what is happening?

251
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,160
What? AG-3 walked out on her own?

She couldn't have gone far yet.

Aren't you cold? Where are you going in that?

263
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,140
I'm going home.

264
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,750
Where's home?

265
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,260
A place where family and friends are.

266
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:50,080
- Where's that though?
- A place that can recharge me.

267

Don't wander around and quickly go before you end up like me.

268

What does it mean to end up like you?

269
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:08,140
Having no one to meet

270

Take this and take the bus.

274
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,490
You know how to take the bus, right?

275

Hurry and go. Your family must be worried.

276

Hurry and go. Don't disturb me.

277

President Hwang, are you going to keep this up?

278

<i>Did you cause Chairman Park's accident, President Hwang?</i>

279

<i>Remember this clearly. You know nothing. </i>

<i>your family can live. </i>

282
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,530
You still have nothing to say?

283
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,450
When my lawyer gets here, we'll talk then.

284
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,290
I'm leaving tonight.

285
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,500
Do everything you can to get the AG-3 back.

286
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,660
If you can't make it happen, destroy it.

287
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,850
I don't want anyone else getting their hands on it.

288
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:54,240
Listen, I know that Hwang acquired those shares illegally.

289
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,790
I was the one who gave him the money to do it.

290
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:01,280
Which means if you don't do what I tell you to do,

291
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,520
your father will be the one to get hurt.

292
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,700
We're all in this together, you know.

293
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:22,180
Is it true that my father killed Chairman Park Seong Jin like the detective said?

294
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,580
It's not true.

295
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,700
Then who was it?

296
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,990
Director Yoon!

297
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:34,380
It was Chairman Martin, but we don't have evidence.

298
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:40,530
President kept quiet about Martin's crime and got a rebate.

299
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:44,580
When Martin said earlier that we're all in the same boat, that's what he meant.

300
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:49,090
So my father committed collusion by keeping quiet?

301
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:55,480
Martin leaving Korea quickly and President getting released as innocent is the best scenario we can hope for.

302
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,320
For that, we absolutely need Director Ye on our side.

303
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,640
Only then, we can get rid of Chairman Kim Min Kyu.

304
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:13,120
Martin's side and President Hwang's side are probably all after her so we need to find her first no matter what.

305
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:20,150
I suddenly thought of this but why does it feel like AG-3 will go home?

306
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:23,800
I think I would think of home first if I were her.

Don't lose her. Get her no matter what.

00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,590
Thank you.

317
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,480
Pretty.

318
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:23,180
<i>In a moment, the bus...</i>

319
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,490
She took the bus a moment ago.

320
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:36,480
Dr. Hong? Not long ago, AG-3 took the bus.

321
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,570
So we end up leaving without seeing her?

322
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:07,100
We waited long enough.

323
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:11,220
You're not focused again. Drive properly!

324
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,860
Over there!

325
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,580
AG-3!

326
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:21,550
Hey, you won big time today.

327
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:30,190
AG-3!

328
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,060
AG-3, where are you going?

329
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,170
I'm going home.

330
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,360
I'll give you a ride. Get in.

331
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,570
Get in. Get in.

332
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,460
Get in.

333
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,080
Good.

334
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,060
Oh.

335
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,240
Get them out.

336
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,660
Open the door.

337
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,720
- Uncle, do you know them?
- Open it. Hey! Open!

338
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,230
Open! Open!

339
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,940
Don't get scared.

340
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,740
- AG-3, we will protect you.
- Open the door!
