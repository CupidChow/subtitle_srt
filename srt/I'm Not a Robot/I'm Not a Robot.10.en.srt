1
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,930
It's all good now. I don't see him. Breathe.

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,110
Man, I'm dying here.

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:15,180
Why did you come to where I was? Did you follow me by chance?

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,420
I almost got caught earlier for goodness sake!

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,880
Didn't I tell you not to mindlessly follow him?

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,530
- Why did you follow him around just to be treated like that?
- What are you talking about?

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,640
What are you talking about, huh? You, earlier, that,

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,450
kissing, forehead, that guy, there—

9
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,990
Never mind. Forget about it. Are you protesting or something?

10
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,750
What? Why would I?

11
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,430
Why are you overdoing it? Why don't you want to listen to me?

12
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,700
Fine. I'm sorry, all right?

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,820
I'm going to get some shut eye now, so wake me up when we get there.

14
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,560
How can you fall asleep in a situation like this?

15
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,300
Fine, sleep then.

16
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,270
What have I done?

17
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,690
Are we here?

18
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,250
What the heck? But this is is my house.

19
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,530
I had a feeling that you still lived here.

20
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,490
But why did you bring me here instead of that house?

21
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,620
I will bring your stuff for you and take my stuff from you then.

22
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,090
What are you talking about? Why?

23
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,210
The test is over.

24
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,710
Your part-time is over as of today.

25
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,840
It's true. I bumped into all kinds of people today

26
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,970
but I felt perfectly fine.

27
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,200
I'm telling you that I really didn't have any reactions!

28
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,750
Doctor, what do I have to do for you to believe me?

29
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,440
Look. No scars, right?

30
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,380
No way!

31
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,730
<i>There is no way that your body can return to a normal state this quickly without medication.</i>

32
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,430
That's what I'm saying!

33
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,990
It's been 15 years.

34
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,920
<i>We purchased all kinds of medications in the world and tried them out, but they were no use.</i>

35
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,090
But there's a change for the first time after all these years. And on top of that, it's an amazing change!

36
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,840
You are saying that this is all because of that robot in the video clip you've sent me?

37
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,770
Yes! Well, I don't know the reason... though.

38
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,220
You brought in a robot that looks exactly like a human into your house,

39
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,610
and whenever you have that robot next you, you don't get any allergic reactions?

40
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,780
Exactly!

41
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,590
<i>How long has it been since you brought that robot into your home?</i>

42
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,840
About....10 days...

43
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,740
What have you been doing with that robot in those 10 days?

44
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,120
What did we do? We just stayed home.

45
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,050
So what did you guys do together?

46
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,500
Not much.

47
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,820
<i>Listen carefully to what I'm about to tell you.</i>

48
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:26,070
<i>This is a miracle. A miracle occurred for you, Patient Kim Min Kyu.</i>

49
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,240
<i>First of all, think about all of the big and small moments</i>

50
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,420
<i>that might have triggered a change from the moment you brought the robot home until now.</i>

51
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,980
<i>Even if it's something trivial, that would be fine, too.<i></i></i>

52
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,220
You might be able to figure it out, by connecting all of those moments together,

53
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,160
how you were able to heal.

54
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,050
It's been so long, hasn't it?

55
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,850
So adorable.

56
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,780
- Please open the door.
- Listen to your mother, sweetie.

57
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,970
Jo Ji Ah, you did all you could.

58
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:39,950
My part-time job has ended, so leave it up to the heavens to take care of the final screening.

59
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:47,590
There's no way that he wouldn't open up the final screening after reading that tear-jerking petition.

60
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,590
Feeling the heat on my back feels great.

61
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,710
Why are you so cute, you sweet little adorable thing?

62
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,200
Jo Ji Ah, snap out of it! Snap out of it now! You can do it.

63
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,100
Rock, paper, scissors!

64
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,460
You're so mean!

65
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,020
So hot.

66
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,780
What's the meaning of that kiss anyway?

67
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,790
Is he treating me like a little kid or an actual woman?

68
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,510
You were just a robot to that man.

69
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,220
Just a robot.

70
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,490
- Please kiss me.
- Kiss m--

71
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,450
Please kiss me, darling.

72
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,500
You're so adorable.

73
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,060
- It's so cold.
- You're cold.

74
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,780
So cold...

75
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:13,800
<i>You freaking bastard! You think you are lost in the galaxy of Andromeda?</i>

76
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,870
<i>Would you like me to help you find your way back?! The feeling of your head flying downward</i>

77
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,840
<i>when bungee jumping in the Grand Canyon. Do you want me to help you feel it from head to toe,</i>

78
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,120
<i>you freaking jerk!</i>

79
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:29,550
I wonder if that was the miraculous moment?

80
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:00,240
Or could it be starting from then on?

81
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,160
♫ <i>Would you understand me</i> ♫

82

<i>Master's smiling.</i>

87
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,500
She was so cute at that time.

♫ <i>I love you</i> ♫

89
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:38,000
So cu— But cuteness doesn't make miracles happen.

90
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,600
- Yes, Doctor.
- Patient Kim Min Kyu,

91
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,880
is that robot really like a human being?

92
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:53,590
- Yes.
- Have you ever told that robot about your worries and concerns?

93
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,010
Yes.

94
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,930
Did you tell it about your sickness as well?

95
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,450
Well...

96
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,360
Kind of?

97
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,030
You said you were together for 10 days, right?

98
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:10,610
So how do you think you'll feel if you can't see the robot for 10 days?

99
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,100
Well...

100
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,780
Well... I'll... I'll miss... her

101
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,600
a lit... tle but 10 days is too long.

102
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,280
<i>It seems like you and that robot have built a friendship.</i>

103
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,640
<i>It seems like that's the reason for the miracle.</i>

104
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,380
<i> Just who is it? Who is the person that dares to do something to you? </i>

105
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,850
<i>Tell them to come here and I'll take care of them all!</i>

106
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,220
<i>Still,</i>

107
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,340
<i>you grew up really well, Master.</i>

Yes, it is.

But I don't think that's the same guy from before.

115
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,120
But why does he look so familiar?

That's him, right? That's Professor Hong Baek Gyun for sure, right?!

118
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,770
That's him. He looks exactly the same as in the photo.

119
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,130
He's leaving. He's leaving!

120
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,610
Get ready! Hold on a minute!

121

You little punks, I've got you now.

122

Why isn't he answering his phone when it isn't even turned off?

This bastard.

126
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,840
This guy Baton is very perverted on the inside.

127
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,850
He was weird from the start.

128
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,320
There were a lot of instances where she could've been caught for being human. What happened?

129
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,430
He just skipped over it.

130
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:48,700
He only had that in his mind.

131
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,880
So he wouldn't have been able to see through them.

132
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,580
I can't send AG-3 to that kind of person.

133
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,520
Of course, you can't.

134
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,500
Of course.

135
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,970
That's Jo Ji Ah.

136
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,670
That proves my point even more.

137
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:05,170
Wait... a second. If he did that to a human, isn't that <i>not</i> perverted?

138
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:08,550
If he finds out that she's a human and not a robot,

139
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,820
he could end up with her and have a happy ending together.

140
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,930
He did that knowing that she's a robot.

141
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,700
And once we fix AG-3, she will face the same treatment.

142
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,630
- Is that okay?
- Of course not.

143
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,620
We can't let AG-3 be treated like that.

144
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,190
That is true.

145
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,550
But we have to send her tomorrow morning.

146
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:29,280
If not, he will kick us out with his annoying attitude.

147
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,000
Why would we get kicked out?

148
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
We would be leaving.

Okay, and?

165
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,070
How can he dump someone like me?

166
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,560
- What's with that smile? Are you saying I had it coming?
- No.

167
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,110
Does he have a woman by chance?

168
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:12,670
I'm not sure. We don't talk to each other about our private lives.

169
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,990
Why? Did he say that he didn't like you?

170
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,470
No, well, he didn't say that but

171

I guess it's not to the point of marriage either.

that he's not a pervert or a crazy psycho.

212

It's just that he lived by himself for too long, so that man can't help but be raw like that.

No way.

Why hasn't AG-3 come to work yet?

255
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,800
It's my decision.

256
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,020
Don't you know that AG-3 belongs to KM Financial?

257
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,670
That is why we will find a new investor and pay back the initial research fund.

258
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,070
Let's wrap it up that way.

259

I can't let you do so. Never!

260
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:47,010
Then we have no other choice but to reveal the truth.

261
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,190
What truth?

262
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:53,720
That KM Financial's chairman is a pervert that sexually assaulted a robot?

263
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,060
What?

264
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,830
Pervert? Assaulted?

265
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,090
Who did that?!

266
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:02,850
You... did that! A kiss on AG-3! A kiss!

267
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,120
Right in the middle, here!

268
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,930
That is-- I had a good reason in that situation--

269
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,830
I don't want to know about the situation nor am I curious.

270
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:16,410

- There is a small problem, so she's under maintenance.

The rumors spread here, too.

278
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:43,900
I expected as much, but I have to be careful, too.

279
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,360
Okay, that's fine. A company that can't tell what's real from what's fake,

280
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,530
we decline from our end as well.

It doesn't seem like it'll be easy to find an investor.

282
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,580
I'm leaving.

283
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,340

- Stop. Let's take a break first.

284
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,480
I came to get my bag.

285
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,900
I will inform Ssanip to give it to you.

286
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,740
Don't enter the house no matter what.

287
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,400
Okay.

288
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,670
I'll wait in front.

289
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,940
Why did they tell me not to go in at all?

290
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,030
I got fully dressed up in costume just in case.

291
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:41,210
- Oh my.
- What are you doing here?

292
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,110

The cart... Ji Ah is there.

294
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,950
Oh no.

295
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,560
A problem occurred, Sunbae.

296

299
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,730
Good job. Very good job.

300
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,920
That's right. When your master calls you, you should come to your master whenever and wherever you are.

301
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:43,080
It was worth going through all the trouble of training you.

302
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,680
But you need a scolding first.

303
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:53,000
Did I do something wrong?

304
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,850
That you're a robot. That's what's wrong.

305
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:00,410
Just because I'm a robot, I need a scolding?

306
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:05,140
Yeah. The reason why you're getting scolded is because you don't have a heart.

307
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,010
Starting today, you have to study me every day.

308
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,670
And you have to input an immense amount of information.

309
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:15,240
I will put down my roots into that heart of yours that's actually a hard drive.

310
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:23,150
If not, I will be very wronged.

311
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,070
It will use up a lot of the battery's power.

312
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:33,550
How much power do you have left? No. How long can you stay with me?

313
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,980
In battery saving mode, about eight hours at the most.

314
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,790
Really? AG-3, battery saving mode.

00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:42,400
I'm entering battery saving mode.

316
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,560
Please do not ask me to do chores if you can while I'm in battery saving mode.

317
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,630
If you don't work, then should I do it?

318
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:54,770
Should I turn off the battery saving mode?

319
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:58,760
Okay. Firstly, don't stand, sit.

320
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,210
AG-3, friend mode.

321
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,930
Why did you call me?

322
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:16,720
Why are you being modest all of a sudden? Call me like how you usually do. "Why did you call me?" like that.

323
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,970
Why are you picking a fight again?

324
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:24,860
Someone asked me what our relationship was.

325
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:29,380
So what do you think I said?

326
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,500
What did you say?

327
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:37,810
I said that you're an ungrateful one who left your master and followed another man.

328
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:49,290
And even so, you're my first friend I've made in 15 years, and admitting that...

329
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,430
Know that it wasn't easy.

330
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:59,850
And you, you should really be thankful.

331
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:05,560
I'm about to spend an obscene amount of money to protect you.

332
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:11,030
Hong Baek Gyun is trying to tear our relationship apart.

333
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:18,150
But I, no matter what happens, will not lose you.

334
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:22,620
Firstly, we will attack the team members.

335
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,590
Are you going to beg them for help?

336
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,780
Me? Those words? Not over my dead body.

337
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:37,310
Don't worry. I will do things my way to protect you.

338
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,100
What is this?

339
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:52,440
It's compensation. Please share it with your members.

340
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,350
No need to thank me.

341
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:57,650
We don't accept these kinds of things.

342
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:00,290
This kind of money...

343
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,020
Leave it.

344
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,950
It's a check!

345
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,360
A check?

346
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,920
This is a contract stating that the additional funding of 50 billion won will be sent by the end of this month.

347
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,410
We will check them all at once.

348
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:15,800
No need for that.

349
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,760
Please take it back.

350
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,160
As expected, you know how to negotiate.

351
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:32,390
- Double?
- Double.

352
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:35,550
We don't need it.

353
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:40,390
Fine then. Just give them all that we prepared.

354
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:52,010
We don't need it no matter what the price is.

355
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:55,060
You don't need 50 billion won?

356
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:59,000
I mean, you're saying that you're going to throw away the opportunity of receiving your research funding of 50 billion won?

357
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,790
You should be happy that Doctor is not here.

358
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:07,430
You better return the robot you stole before he returns tonight.

359
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,630
Stole? How dare--

360
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,020
Why did you attend this kind of meeting?

361
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:13,300
- I think a discussion...
- It feels like we should discuss...

362
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,760
Let's continue discussing.

363
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,960
We are prone to accepting your off--

364
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,230
Wait a sec!

365
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,900
Wait a second.

366
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,170
Listen carefully!

367
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,740
AG-3 is mine. She's mine!

368
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,770
Let go!

369
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:32,350
And also, in terms of your working conditions,

370
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:38,150
Master prepared some special rules for you all. Here you go!

371
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,510
First off, starting now

372
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:46,540
you are now free from the rule of staying within a 20-meter radius of this building.

373
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:51,650
Second is that you can now order food whenever you desire.

374
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:56,470
Last is the main point. All the different areas of this mansion.

375
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,940
<i>[A free pass to the swimming pool, indoor gym, walkway, garden and other facilities - Usable wherever, whenever!!]</i>

376
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,020
You have a free pass.

377
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,030
- Nice!
- We did it!

378
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,380
We refuse.

379
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,100
Aish, really.

380
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,330
How could there be humans like that?

381
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,660
Wait a sec. Wait a sec.

382
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,430
What the? It's already four?

383
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:20,060
What do I do? They will come soon to retrieve you. How can I persuade them?

384
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:23,060
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Shall I help you?

385
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:23,950
How?

386
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:28,190
Why else would there be a saying such as "a full ghost shines better?"

387
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,630
Okay. I got the feeling.

388
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:35,760
A hotel buffet. Shall I rent it out completely? Or high-end catered food?

389
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,150
First, let's pick a cuisine. Korean, Japanese, Western or Chinese?

390
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,440
That's not right.

391
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:50,050
Okay! Well, if I'm going to treat them, then might as well go big. I'll call a world-class chef.

392
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:54,320
Is this not it either?

393
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,860
A cruise ship.

394
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:03,180
They didn't take your money. What makes you think that your money-flaunting will work now?

395
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,410
Flaunting.

396
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:07,430
- You do it.
- Flaunting?

397
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,310
Cook, I mean.

398
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:16,700
So you're saying that I should cook and serve those humans over there?

399
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,530
You don't want to?

400
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,530
Yeah, I don't want to. That won't ever happen!

401
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:22,100
How could you say such obnoxious things?

402
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:27,490
Do you want to lose your precious treasure?

403
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,690
No, that's not it.

404
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:44,740
You had plates like these? They're so pretty.

405
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:50,040
My mother liked to invite people over and cook for them.

406
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,830
These are the bowls my mother used.

407
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,840
After fifteen years, I get to use them.

408
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:07,900
Know that this is a huge honor.

409
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,260
I miscalculated how much sauce to use because I've only ever cooked for one person.

410
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,230
AG-3, search it.

411
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:30,110
Seafood stew. When increasing the amount from one to four, what should be the ratio between the sauce and the other ingredients?

412
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:36,740
The amount of sauce you should use is as if you're cooking for three and then add more as needed.

413
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,590
Okay. Go and sit.

414
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,390
I will help you.

415
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:45,690
Your battery will run out. Sitting is helping me.

416
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,100
Did you cut yourself?

417
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,130
Why are you cooking as if your life depends on it?

418
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:03,030
Because this cooking

419
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:06,060
is the only weapon to protect you.
