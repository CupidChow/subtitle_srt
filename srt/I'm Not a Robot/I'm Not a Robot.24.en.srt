1
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,350
What a shock!

2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,880
<i>[MONAMI folder has been leaked.]</i>

3
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:35,720
We succeeded in opening the folder, but the video was damaged in the process of transfer.

4
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,150
Still, we were able to save a few minutes of a short clip.

5
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:47,840
The password was pretty interesting. It's "sandwich."

6
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,860
Okay, got it.

7
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,490
We failed to steal AG-3's technical file,

8
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:06,180
but we were able to save an unexpected video.

9
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,760
Okay, got it.

10
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,660
<i> Oh, my!</i>

11
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,590
<i> Oh, friend mode?</i>

12
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,480
That guy held himself up all high and mighty, yet...

13
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,510
<i>Do you think you can be my friend?</i>

14
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,190
He doesn't even know that he made a fool out of himself.

15
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:09,360
Dad, you know I really love you. Right?

16
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,480
Of course. I love you, too.

17
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,140
Then please let go of me now.

18
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,350
I want to live the way I want and follow my own path.

19
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,290
I have someone I like,

20
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,770
and I don't have any plans on getting engaged to or married to Kim Min Kyu.

21
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,300
The coffee's good here.

22
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,450
Dad, please. I'm telling you sincerely.

23
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,860
I'm being sincere, too.

24
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,950
Your future husband is Kim Min Kyu.

25
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,720
Please don't cause me to lose the respect I have for you.

26
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,420
It's a favor I'm asking you.

27
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,600
I'm sorry, but due to lunch reservations, we aren't accepting customers today.

28
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,220
Oh, well, we aren't customers. Perhaps is there Jo Ji Ah here?

29
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,280
You're here?

30
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:35,820
- What about Kim Min Kyu?
- He's on the second floor, probably washing up.

31
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,530
Did you, by any chance...?

32
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,540
I didn't get caught.

33
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,590
I made a promise with him. He's not going to do this anymore.

34
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,300
Are you okay?

35
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,330
Hurry and leave with him. Customers will be coming soon.

36
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,710
Hello?

37
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:13,060
I'm currently at Geoje Island right now. Do you have anything you want to eat?

38
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,150
We're okay. Just hurry and come with Dr. Hong.

39
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,830
Do you miss me that much?

40
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,910
Yes, of course, Brother. So, hurry and come.

41
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:32,320
The yuzu bread is really good here. I'll buy and take it.

42
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,150
Oh and also, since it'll be cold tonight,

43
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,310
you guys can all sleep in my home.

44
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,750
I already bought the blankets. Got it?

45
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,560
Brother!

46
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,420
Please...

47
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,130
Just come back home safely.

48
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,870
Seriously, you're getting punished in such a strange way.

49
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,200
That promise.

50
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,660
I shouldn't have made it.

51
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,950
Compared to yesterday when you came, your face looks better.

52
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,820
Did you guys settle your misunderstandings?

53
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,890
Please give me work. What should I do?

54
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,620
The customers will be coming in soon anyway.

55
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,640
You must've been shivering all night. Go and rest.

56
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,340
I want to work, Grandma.

57
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,460
Oh, it's me.

58
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,790
What did you say? Today?

59
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,010
How did this suddenly happen?

60
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,840
Oh, okay. I got it. I'll be right over.

61
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,160
Did something happen?

62
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,150
Because it's winter, a lot of the elderly get into accidents.

63
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,460
I'll have to go to the hospital.

64
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,620
It's Hong Joo's. Today's lunch isn't going to work out.

65
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,400
Eat somewhere else.

66
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,870
Okay. I'll let you know, okay?

67
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,730
I'll be back soon, so

68
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,990
after your friends leave, close the store for the meantime.

69
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,630
Please go and return safely.

70
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,470
I got it.

71
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,360
You lost a lot of weight.

72
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,540
There's no diet that works better than heartbreak.

73
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,490
Are you okay?

74
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,630
Yes, I am.

75
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,240
Let's go directly to Seoul.

76
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,280
I have something to tell you. It's about the company.

77
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,490
Let's get going to Seoul.

78
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,920
Kim Hong Joo, I apologize.

79
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,700
He won't be doing this again.

80
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,310
I believe that you won't do this from now on,

81
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,540
because you made a promise.

82
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,520
I'll get going.

83
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,740
Goodbye.

84
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,770
Then.

85
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,890
<i>- Let's go!
- Hurry up.</i>

86
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,270
- Aigoo.
- I'm starving.

87
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,420
- Let's go.
- Let's go quickly.

88
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,750
- Wow.
- I'm so hungry.

89
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,650
Boss, we're here!

90
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:38,190
- We're here!
- My boss called you guys earlier saying she had to cancel the reservation.

91
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,840
No, we didn't get that notice.

92
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,140
What the heck? How can you cancel on the day of? We never got a call.

93
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,040
Is this your first day working or something?

94
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,520
I'm sorry, I really am.

95
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,040
Forgot about the apology. We don't need anything luxurious. Just bring us anything and we'll be all right.

96
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,840
Hyungnims, come on in. It's fine.

97
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,700
- Aigoo. I'm starving.
- Aigoo.

98
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,390
- Hurry up.
- Aigoo. Seriously.

99
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,540
Seriously.

100
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,840
I'm really sorry, but we don't have a chef in the kitchen at the mom—

101
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,040
Assorted sashimi, seafood stew, and seafood green onion pancake are possible.

102
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,970
If those are good enough, then please sit quietly.

103
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,980
If not, then food won't be able to come out. Okay?

104
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,790
- Just give us whatever!
- I'm starving!

105
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,370
Can we also get soju?

106
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:26,480
What are you doing right now? You should leave. We made a promise.

107
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,420
- Do you know how to cut sashimi?
- No.

108
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,040
What about green onion pancake?

109
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,240
No.

110
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,230
I know how. I'll just do this and leave.

111
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,440
Ji... I mean, Hong Joo. What should we do?

112
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,920
What should we do?

113
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,330
Hong Joo will be my assistant. The two of you should serve and manage the hall. Okay?

114
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,180
- Get moving quickly.
- Serving, okay.

115
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,570
Okay, got it.

116
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,330
You're here, Team Leader Jo?

117
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:18,260
Yes, I am. Why did you call me over?

118
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,350
Why? Is it because I'm no longer the CEO?

119
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,200
No. You can talk to me.

120
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,020
You have a younger sister, it seems.

121
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,430
I think I know what she looks like.

122
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,020
What do you mean?

123
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,760
In this world,

124
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:41,750
there is someone who actually exists that looks exactly like AG-3.

125
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,570
Your younger sister.

126
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,570
Don't you have something to tell me?

127
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:53,770
There must be a misunderstanding here.

128
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,600
My younger sister has no idea about robots or anything like that.

129
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,150
Doctor Hong just used my younger sister as a model to make a robot, that's all.

130
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:07,250
So your younger sister has no idea about this situation then?

131
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,950
Yes, that's right.

132
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,060
You must not know your younger sister.

133
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,330
- What?
- You see...

134
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:20,150
Why did Doctor Hong

135
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,670
use your younger sister's face to make a robot?

136
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,930
It's because they were once close in the past.

137
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,290
It's the truth, sir!

138
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,950
My younger sister has no relation to this whatsoever!

139
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,290
Please pass me a plate. Give me that small one over there.

140

eat now.

159
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:56,400
By the way, Hong Joo, is your last name Kim or... Ji?

160
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,820
I thought I heard someone saying, Ji Hong Joo earlier.

161
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,530
No, it was a mistake.

162
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,790
Yes, her full name is Kim Hong Joo.

163
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:09,130
- That's right.
- Oh, it's Kim Hong Joo.

164
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:12,180
Miss Kim Hong Joo, please enjoy.

165
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,130
This will be your first and last time trying my cooking.

166
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,250
Come on, have some.

167
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,730
Does it suit your appetite?

168
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:31,120
This is so delicious.

169
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,290
Please try this, too.

170
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:37,210
Now, this is that special seafood onion pancake that's made from my mother's secret recipe.

171
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,910
This is so fabulous.

172
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,940
This too.

173
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,130
This is so tasty.

174
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,080
I should've told this to President Kim earlier.

175
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:13,320
AG-3's face is my younger sister's face and she is also Doctor Hong's ex-girlfriend.

176
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,590
I should've told him the truth.

177
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,750
I should do it before the misunderstanding gets too deep.

178
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,990
I should do it right now.

179
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:32,490
- Yes?
- I would like to talk to you about AG-3.

180
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:36,240
I will give you a call later on since I'm eating right now.

181
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,220
Ah, yes.

182
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,520
What's wrong? Am I eating like a gluttonous person?

183
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,310
I was just...

184
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:58,420
How would I feel if AG-3 got to eat the food I make?

185
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,810
I had a time where I imagined something like that.

186
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:05,370
I thought that it might feel like this somehow.

187
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:13,200
Yes.

188
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,520
Quit that, you're going to give her indigestion.

189
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,360
Oh, I'm sorry.

190
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,080
That's okay.

191
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,950
This most likely will be the last time.

192
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,990
It was Mr. Hwang who resigned, not President Kim.

193
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,260
You really think I wouldn't know?!

194
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,340
Things have been happening unexpectedly.

195
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:41,270
Oh, I have waited long enough.

196
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,300
I'm running out of patience.

197
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,740
I'm going to send someone there myself.

198
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,220
There's still more time until the date I promised.

199
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,370
Please let us handle this until then.

200
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,480
Was that Chairman Martin?

201
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,770
It looks like they know about your resignation.

202
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,740
Give Martin a call.

203
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,590
Let him know that I will return soon and take a seat as the Chairman of the group.

204
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:16,460
And Father, please summon the Board of Directors again.

205
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,640
What are you talking about?

206
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,460
A case of fraud by Doctor Hong Baek Gyun and the Santa Maria Team

207
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,110
was committed to mess with Kim Min Kyu and he was being played by them.

208
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,960
Huh?

209
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:33,070
So it should've been Kim Min Kyu who should've resigned, instead of me.

210
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,530
What is this?

211
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,980
Monami?

212
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,180
This means, "My Friend" in French.

213
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,280
I told you last time to confirm this and delete them all, Hoktal Sunbae.

214
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,430
I didn't make this.

215
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,360
Then who would make this?

216
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,120
Doctor said he didn't make it either.

217
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,260
What? Who did this then?

218
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,560
Oh no!

219
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:13,600
Hey, Ssanip, you remember right? AG-3 made a backup folder all by herself last year, right?

220
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,010
Of course.

221
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,110
Because of that, running folders with patterns were exposed and

222
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:20,320
got all mixed up, so we went through hell because of it. Remember that?

223
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,620
So this robot made a backup folder all by itself?

224
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,850
What's going on here?

225
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:30,550
AG-3, you know that Monami Folder.

226
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,310
Did you really make it?

227
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,290
Yes, sir, I made it.

228
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,660
Hey!!!

229
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,690
You can't constantly be bringing out folders that have been thrown into the trash bin, okay?!

230
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:43,270
It's not a folder that was thrown into the trash bin, but it's the folder that was stored before the reset.

231
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,630
Everything that you have done for me

232
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,570
and that heart of yours

233
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,240
will be remembered and won't die.

234
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,720
<i>[Monami backup]</i>

235
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,950
<i>[Backup process]</i>

236
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:03,910
<i>[Backup complete]</i>

237
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,520
What is going on?

238
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,980
Didn't we delete them all?

239
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,410
Then the folder that just got leaked

240
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,870
is our brother's important stuff.

241
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:20,070
What the hell!

242
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:23,600
Brother? You mean, Kim Min Kyu?

243
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,740
I kept my promise with my friend.

244
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,140
We will be going to the Alps since we got a long-term payment that we had been dreaming about.

245
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,870
So why is your mouth so wide open like that again?

246
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:48,950
Uncle, the Alps is not the important thing right now.

247
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,000
What's important then?

248
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,580
I wanted to know what kind of person you are.

249
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,420
Who?

250
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,510
Who are you?

251
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:04,960
I want to get to know you as well.

252
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,840
It's my first time hearing someone say that to me.

253
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,550
I never ever said anything like that to you?

254
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:21,210
Ah, let's just go. The sun will go down soon.

255
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:26,900
Mr. Kim Min Kyu.

256
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,010
It's common courtesy to help with the dishes after you eat.

257
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:33,540
It's okay, I will do it. I have strong arms.

258
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,980
Do you want to do it with me?

259
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,940
No, I will do it.

260
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,250
I will do it too then.

261
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,360
Hong Joo, please take her out. She is very bothersome.

262
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,830
The dishes.

263
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,110
You're so senseless.

264
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:56,280
You should've just let me and Hong Joo take care of this for goodness sake.

265
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,060
You would make her feel so uncomfortable, you know.

266
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,800
I'm certain that you would've stared at her like this instead of the dishes.

267
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,570
- Aigoo...
- Whenever I look at that girl, my heart

268
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:10,000
beats like when I'm looking at AG-3, that's why.

269
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,900
My heart flutters, itches, and I become happy.

270
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,630
So that's why I want to see her more. What am I supposed to do then?

271
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:24,840
What's more weird is for some reason

272
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:30,290
I feel like my connection with her won't end here.

273
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:35,050
I feel like there's a next time and a next-next time.

274
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,290
Don't you find it weird, too?

275
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:56,840
When we were locked up together, I was scared that I might get caught; but at the same time, I was happy.

276
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:04,740
However, I started to become greedy.

277
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,130
Since he likes me that much, I thought to myself

278
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:17,410
if I told him honestly, he might end up forgiving me and trusting me again.

279
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:25,760
I kept becoming greedy, so towards the end was a bit hard for me.

280
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:34,520
But I know I can't do that.

281
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:56,400
I guess it's really goodbye now.

282
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:10,900
The first and last meal you made was really delicious.

283
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:16,560
If it was delicious, then become my friend.

284
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:24,890
Please keep the promise of never appearing in my life again.

285
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:34,670
However, why do I feel like we're going to meet again?

286
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:42,780
That won't happen now. Never.

287
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:18,550

303
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,740
Do you have indigestion?

304
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,000
Once I take medicine, I'll be fine.

305
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,980
Yes?

306
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:55,980
What? What are you saying? Explain it to me so I can understand.

307
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,220
What should we do, Doctor?

308
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:04,980
We would never have imagined that AG-3 would do such a thing.

309
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,450
We're on our way back right now, so, as of right now, check how much of the file was leaked.

310
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:10,350
What happened?

311
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:13,140
AG-3 saved a backup file of Kim Min Kyu's deep learning process.

312
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,050
- What?
- We have to go back quickly.

313
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,430
Where did he go?

314
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,360
Yes?

315
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:44,810
Yoo Cheol already showed me everything. He's starting to become smarter now.

316
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:50,790
When we were trying to get that file, we came upon something else, so I looked into it. It's very interesting.

317
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:54,620
Director Kim has a disease.

318
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,570
It is sufficient enough to get him dismissed from his position.

319
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:06,700
<i>[Hong Joo's]</i>

320
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,960
The owner isn't here right now.

321
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,690
I'm looking for a young lady that stays here. She about this tall and has short hair.

322
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:35,630
That young lady took her things and left.

323
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:39,650
L-Left? When? Where to?

324
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:44,310
She didn't leave too long ago and went this way. Was it about five minutes ago?

325
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:57,020
I'm certain that he went back there.

Did you fool me...

340
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:37,240
until now?

341
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:52,150
