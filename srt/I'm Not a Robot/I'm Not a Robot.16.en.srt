00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,790
Coffee with a lot of syrup, please.

3
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,400
I'm craving something sweet.

4
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,830
Some poor guy came by just now.

5
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,650
That timing though.

6
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,810
That guy's getting engaged, right? He just came by.

7
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,690
He came all the way here to announce that?

8
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,390
So is confessing out of the question now?

9
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,470

10
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,800
<i> No matter how her appearance might change? </i>

11
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,760
<i>No matter how I change in my looks,</i>

12
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,080
<i> I hope you can still recognize me.</i>

13
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,260
<i>What did you just say?</i>

14
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,310
<i>Let's get married.</i>

15

<i>I think that</i>

16
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,690
<i>you also have feelings towards me.</i>

17
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,320
<i>- Me?
- Yeah. Otherwise, why would you come here?</i>

18
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,040
<i>That's because you said it was urgent.</i>

19
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,700
<i>But still, you chose to come to another guy while you were on a date?</i>

20
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,610
<i>You're not a guy to me. You're just my friend.</i>

21
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:52,440
<i>For real, am I not considered as a guy to you?</i>

22
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,570
<i>Hey, I'm going to become your friend's wife.</i>

23
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,820
<i>Watch your manners.</i>

24
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,570
<i>I'm forgiving you because you seem drunk tonight.</i>

25
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,470
Since when were you here?

26
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,680
I'm getting engaged to Min Kyu.

27
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,060
Let's all have a meal one day and hash things out. We still have to see each other.

28
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,870
Hello?

29
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,700
- I'm Jang Doo Sam.
- Yes.

30
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,180
Please let Chairman Kim Min Kyu know

31
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,190
that if he promises to put President Hwang in jail, I'll give all my recordings to him.

32
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,850
All right, I'll give you a call later.

33
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,060
- Team Leader Jo.
- Yes?

34
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,400
- Director Yoon.
- Glad I bumped into you. Come with me.

35
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,200
Okay.

36
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,680

- Are you Team Leader Jo Jin Bae?
- Yes.

39
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,310
Come sit.

40
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,540
Please help out CEO Hwang a lot.

41
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,630
I am well aware of what you do for Kim Min Kyu.

42
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,630
I'm not telling you to quit doing that.

43
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,560
I'm just saying that whatever you gain knowledge of, I hope we know it first.

44
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,880
Soon KM Financial is going to have

45
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,230
a company-wide reorganization.

46
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,090
The system where Kim Min Kyu acted as king

47
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,780
will become a story of the past.

48
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,630
Do you think he will side with us?

49
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,450
He doesn't need to.

50
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,090
As long as it isn't Min Kyu's side.

51
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,090
What will you do about Jang Doo Sam?

52
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,350
<i>The robot industry doesn't make a lot of money yet, so</i>

53
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,990
<i> Kim Min Kyu won't invest in it.</i>

54
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,250
<i>Why don't you sell that part to Britain's Bold Group?</i>

55
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,120
<i>I know Chairman Martin well.</i>

56
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,680
<i>I can persuade Chairman Kim Min Kyu, President Hwang.</i>

57
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,540
<i>Please give me some of your support.</i>

58
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,250
<i>Either way, I think you are quite impressive, Chairman Park.</i>

59
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,110
<i>How did you think to</i>

60
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,650
<i>hide this robot in secret as a part of the R&D team?</i>

61
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,300
- More than anything, we need to find out about it before Kim Min Kyu does.
- Yes.

62
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,370
Ah, before that, what about AG-3?

63
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,430
Hey, just confess it.

64
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:33,060
It's a problem if a robot loves a person, but is it a problem when a person loves a person?

65
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,090
Honestly, you're not an alien or something.

66
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,620
Is Kim Min Kyu actually going to kill you

67
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,450
because you're not a real robot?

68
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:46,050
Hey, listen. I planned to confess everything after the test.

69
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,480
But he ignores me this much as a robot. Imagine him knowing that I'm a person.

70
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,130
He's going to charge at me to kill me.

71
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,060
You should wear this for the presentation.

72
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,530
With this on, Jin Bae or whoever won't recognize you.

73
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,560
Even I would ignore you.

74
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,300
Man, this is cool.

75
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,830
I have to look really strong to not be discouraged there.

76
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,330
Yes. You're the crazy bitch here!

77
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,710
Go to KM Financial!

78
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,840
Let's go!

79
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,310
AG-3 ate what?

80
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:26,000
- Yes. An ice cream.
- But it's a robot.

81
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,760
- I didn't see it, but he did.
- She really ate it.

82
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,990
- For real, like this.
- So it's not a robot, but a person?

83
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,570
No. I'm sure it's a robot.

84
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,150
It's a robot but it ate an ice cream?

85
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,890
I stabbed it with this, and this stick broke

86
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,430
as if it hit an iron plate.

87
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,840
If it was a person, it would scream, bleed, and cause chaos.

88
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,260
But it didn't even flinch.

89
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,110
I think it's an extremely great robot, Uncle.

90
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,230
Since we had to determine whether it's a human or a robot,

91
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,520
we failed to kidnap it.

92
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,870
However, next time for sure—

93
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,220
Are you kidding me? What kind of excuse is that?

94
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,750
No really, it's a robot...

95
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,340
That Social Contribution Team Leader bastard.

96
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,590
He made these guys responsible for this and left?

97
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:16,560
How much money did you receive from the Social Contribution Team Leader?

98
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,010
30,000,000 won and an additional 30,000,000 won.

99
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:28,300
The remaining 40,000,000, Team Leader took...

100
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,420
Ah, seriously.

101
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,870
I'm giving you one more chance.

102
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:38,670
Make sure to bring AG-3 within three days. Understand?

103
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,010
Why? Is it not well-cooked?

104
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,910
Why are you being so nice to me these days? I can't get used to it.

105
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,630
- You don't like it?
- I'm not saying I don't like it.

106
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:09,530
I'm just afraid what kind of job you will make me do next time.

107
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,550
- You made the final rounds.
- What?

108
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,320
KM Financial Competition for young entrepreneurs.

109
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,420
I'm not taking your food. Eat slowly.

110
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,020
Chairman Kim Min Kyu's not the one judging. The social contribution team will be proceeding that.

111
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,110
And I'll be completely disguised so that even my brother can't recognize me.

112

You really don't have to worry.

113
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,290
If you had told me earlier, I could've helped you.

114
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,910
There's nothing for you to help with.

115
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,110
It was the same item that was submitted

116
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,630
four years ago, right? What happened then?

117
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,630
It's too early for you to ask me about that.

118
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,070
Of course, it got eliminated.

119
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,290
But this time, I'm really confident.

120
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,340
Someone said that I'm a genius.

121
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,430
What kind of crazy man said that?

122
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,430
He must be buttering you up to scam you.

123
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,570
You should've called me when you got eliminated from the contest.

124
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,820
I called you, but you didn't pick up.

125
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,350
I didn't pick up?

126
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,430
Then you should have come to school...

127
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,690
You did come.

128
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:30,920

<i>Ji Ah, I found a new route to solving a search algorithm.</i>

160
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:24,260
<i>You mean that thing you've been researching night and day? How?</i>

161
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,420
<i>The main point of communication between a robot and a person is to understand the pattern.</i>

162
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:33,830
<i>How fast and accurately it categorizes a person's mind and feelings into a pattern. That's the key point.</i>

163
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:39,080
<i>The expanded data that is essentially in 3-dimensions will be quickly stacked into groups in parallel worlds; thereby, creating a pattern</i>

164
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:44,050
<i>while securing both great speed and accuracy.</i>

165
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,760
<i>You didn't understand, right?</i>

166
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,040
<i>Yes, but I know that it's something great.</i>

167
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,560
<i>I'll make a robot that's capable of communicating emotions!</i>

168
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,380
<i>Congratulations!!</i>

169
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,490
<i>MIT is asking for me to come as soon as possible.</i>

170
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,460
<i>Then, are you heading to America?</i>

171
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:08,170
<i>Yes. You have to learn English from now on.</i>

172
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,580
<i>I'm also going?</i>

173
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,480
<i>Of course! Come to America with me and do whatever you want.</i>

174
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,800
<i>Don't waste time doing something that doesn't work.</i>

175
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,920
<i>What do you mean by that?</i>

176
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,450
<i>You said you're tired. Don't do it if you feel tired by it.</i>

177
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,460
<i>But you do it even if you're tired.</i>

178
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,630
<i>Are you the same as me?</i>

179

♫ <i>That kind of love</i> ♫

<i>Let's break up.</i>

181

♫ <i>I'm really jealous</i> ♫

182

<i>Let's not see each other ever again.</i>

183

184
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:21,710
Before Chairman Park Seong Jin died, he met President Hwang Do Won.

185
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:25,420
And there's a recording of that night's conversation?

186
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:32,360
Yes. President Hwang had definitely previously known that Santa Maria was a robot development team.

187
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,890
You know what that implies, right?

188
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:40,050
It's proof that President Hwang intentionally sold Daeyang Shipbuilding at the lowest price.

189
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:44,630
We can't legally charge him with the recording as evidence, but it's reason enough to have him dismissed from the board of directors.

190
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:49,170
CEO Hwang won't be able to avoid punishment since he headed the sale of Daeyang Shipbuilding.

191
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:53,930
There's no way they wouldn't have stolen a part of that tremendous amount of money in the sales process.

192
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,330
I think the same. The rebate amount would be tremendous.

193
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,890
It's similar to Yoosung Group's rebate incident where they got paid for omission of information.

194
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:04,120
As Jang Doo Sam wanted, give him my contact information.

195
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,610
In order to protect Santa Maria, we have to get our hands on the recording

196
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,420
before those people realize there's a recording in existence.

197
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:16,950
And I will give you all my ID and passwords that grant full access to all of KM Financial's information,

198
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,490
so secure additional proof. We don't have time.

199
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,600
Okay, got it.

200
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,490
Then what time should I prepare for you to head into the office tomorrow?

201
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,530
Head into the office?

202
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:32,770
I thought you were taking part in the final evaluation for the young entrepreneur competition.

203
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:35,660
That is under the Social Contributions team.

204
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,460
Oh, okay.

205
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:44,660
I'm sorry for misunderstanding you all this time.

206
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:58,220
A bonus... When this work is finished, I'll give you 100%.

207
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,190
300%.

208
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,460
200%. That's it.

209
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,030
Got it.

210
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,260
The moon was bright? A crescent moon was so bright, huh?

211
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:21,580
I know, right? It was a crescent moon, but strangely, it was bright.

212
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,160
Where did you two go without me?

213
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,200
We didn't go anywhere.

214
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,290
I saw it all.

215
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:30,810
I was cold but you left me on the bench and went away by yourselves. I saw.

216
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:31,960
No, we didn't.

217
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:37,330
Don't imagine anything. Did you guys, by any chance, kiss?

218
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:42,720
Kiss? Sun Hye wanted to go to the bathroom so I walked her. That's all.

219
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,350
Hyung, you're scaring me. Stop it.

220
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:49,690
I find you scarier when you're like that. Please stop. Let's go in.

221
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,490
Oh, and pay for today's coffee.

222
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,680
It's cold.

223
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,050
Why do I have to keep buying it when you keep doing bad things?

224
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,990
You must find the coffee here really good.

225
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,650
It's cheap.

226
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,100
It's really good to me.

227
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,460
It lacks a bit of flavor for me.

228
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:23,790
Do you know that coffee and dating are really similar?

229
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:27,700
You have to collect many different beans, roast them, taste them.

230
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:32,420
You're searching for the moment when the coffee tastes perfect for you. That's exactly what dating is like.

231
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:38,390
Yeah, that's right. Searching for someone who's perfect for me.

232
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,790
That's what dating is. You're right.

233
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,130
It's not easy to find something that perfectly suits your taste.

234
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:46,830
If it doesn't suit your taste, then why do you come here?

235
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,300
Because the price is cheap.

236
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,510
This guy, he's strangely playing hard to get.

237
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,700
- Pardon me?
- Pardon?

238
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,090
- What did you just say?
- Include me, too. What?

239
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,140
Last time, she mumbled something, too.

240
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,670
Oh, you arrived?

241
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,980
Help me.

242
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:11,950
I know that I've made a lot of mistakes, so help me.

243
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,690
Where's the electricity?

244
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,730
This doesn't work either.

245
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,580
- Why doesn't it work?
- What's going on?

246
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,290
Surprise!

247
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:25,970
You should've told us earlier. See? We can help you like this.

248
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,730
Get first place and while you're at it, get second, too!
<i>[First place is absolutely yours, CEO Jo! Fighting!]</i>

249
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:32,220
You promised. Four insurances and a bonus.
<i>[Don't get nervous and get first place]</i>

250
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,840
What's all of this? You guys, sorry. And thank you.

251
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,170
I heard that the final screening is held like a free market. Then having fun is the main focus.

252
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,290
Think of us as your judges and explain freely.

253
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,170
Dear, are you there?

254
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,270
Yes, I am here!

255
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:59,180
Like that, no matter how far apart they are in this world, these two are connected.

256
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,530
Is there something wrong?

257
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:13,090
By any chance, did you study quantum physics or know anything about quantum?

258
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,780
What's that?

259
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:19,760
Quantum entanglement.

260
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,130
It's a theory where two particles that are far apart are still connected,

261
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:28,820
so if one particle makes an action, it will affect the other particle.

262
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,940
It means that no matter how far apart they are in this world, they're connected.

263
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,710
Wow, that's so amazing.

264
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:38,700
Yeah, that's amazing. We studied until our brains exploded, but how do you know about it just like that?

265
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,980
We have a true genius right here.

266
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,960
Then do I have the right to be a part of this genius group now?

267
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,740
I'll let you in. Also, later in the future, give me one. I want one.

268
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,550
Who are you going to give it to? Tell me your heart.

Why isn't he picking up? Did something really happen?

306
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:49,750
His blood levels are really good. He would be really amazed if he saw.

You came here early.

311
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,080
Hello!

312
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,560
The situation was really crazy, so I wasn't able to say it then. I'm really thankful, Jo Ji Ah.

313
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,580
Being able to come here is thanks to you.

314
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,410
That's right.

315
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:29,380
- Really.
- Thank you!

316
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:34,270
Not at all, I only grabbed their attention. We did all the hard work together.

317
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:39,460
Let's all do our best and whoever wins, let's applaud wholeheartedly.

318
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,230
Yes.

319
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,120
Good luck!

320
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,960
Did you call for me?

321
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,680
Change the supervisor of today's competition to the CEO.

322
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,740
What is the reason that CEO Hwang is taking part in this?

323
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,500
It is him trying to support you.

324
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,220
If a competition gets supervised by the CEO, then the person in charge will get a good evaluation.

325
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:17,070
Thanks for caring.

326
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:20,220

And we have a special judge this year. KM Financial's CEO will be taking part in the judging.
