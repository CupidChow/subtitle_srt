1
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:43,430
This is the perfect timing for you to kiss someone.

2
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:49,680
<i>A person's temperature, 36.5 degrees.</i>

3
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,490
<i>I confess.</i>

4
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:01,020
<i>There was a time I longed for the warmth of 36.5 degrees.</i>

5
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:13,140
<i>Someone once said the first kiss tasted like apples.</i>

6
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,800
<i>Others have said it was like the first flower bud appearing at the end of a branch.</i>

7
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:25,570
<i>And some have said it was like the ocean </i>

8
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,120
<i>they saw for the first time in their lives.</i>

9
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,670
<i>I have imagined it countless times</i>

10
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:38,780
<i>the moment when the 36.5-degree lips will touch mine.</i>

11
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,370
<i>But the first lips to ever touch mine are—</i>

12
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,590
<i>A robot's?!</i>

13
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,100
You. What are you doing right now?

14
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,590
I'm supposed to do it. Why are you doing it?

15
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,460
You were going to do it to me?

16
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,520
Who said I was going to do it to you?

17
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,030
I'm sorry. I won't ever do it again.

18
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,200
Who said don't do it?

19
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,440
Then sh-should I do it again?

20
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,180
What? Do what? Do what again?

21
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,950
What are you, really? Why are you doing this to me?

22
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,660
Ahh, I can't be losing my mind because of you.

23
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,480
I'm late, huh? Sorry.

24
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,520
You. What happened to your first love?

25
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,930
<i>[Episode 13]</i>

26
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,980
You have a strange hobby. You clearly knew I was on a date, yet you called me?

27
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,030
Why? What's so important?

28
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:13,890
<i>This is the perfect timing for you to kiss someone.</i>

29
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,410
Thanks for driving me.

30
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,600
Can you come by yourself?

31
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,110
Of course. The rain stopped, too. I'll go early in the morning.

32

36

<i> Maybe this person is a genius? Or an expert of some sort?</i>

38
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:29,950
He said the words I've been wanting to hear for my whole life with such delight on his face. How could I not go crazy?

Why did you do that? That was my first kiss!

48
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,130
You just stole my first kiss!

49
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:18,180
I've lived and lived to get my lips taken by a robot.

50
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,960
What are you going to do with this situation?

51

♫ <i>Will you understand me?</i> ♫

52
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,520
Why in the world would she do that to me?

53
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,590
What wrong information did I input that...

54
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,970
<i>Don't forget the feeling, atmosphere, and eye contact from just now.</i>

55
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:49,020
<i>That was sexual tension and at that moment you kiss one another.</i>

56
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,830
<i>This is the perfect timing for you to kiss someone.</i>

57
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:07,220
Perhaps, that was a part of her deep learning?

58
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:17,380
No way. It's not like this is a sci-fi movie, right?

59
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,700
Wait a minute.

60
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,670
I almost got caught.

61
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,570
He passed over it because he's dumb.

62
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,980
You would've been caught immediately if he were a little smarter.

63
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:37,070
Let's be careful! Careful! Careful!

64
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,590
Is she charging?

65
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,120
But why does she feel so unfamiliar?

66
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:30,100
It feels like this is my first time seeing this per— No... Robot.

67
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,610
What is it?

68
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:40,310
I have something to ask AG-3.

69
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,350
As you can see, she's in the middle of charging.

70
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,000
Yes, it seems that she is.

71
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,790
Next time, please contact me ahead of time. That means for you to leave.

72
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,830
This is my house.

73
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,690
Should I stop charging AG-3?

74
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:59,550
Okay, then, let me ask you one thing.

75
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:06,600
Then when a robot... No, no, if AG-3's deep learning goes well,

76
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,520
can it develop feelings, too?

77
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,860
For example, like or dislike types of things?

78
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,080
We don't even know AG-3's limit of deep learning.

79
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,490
It depends on the level of detailed input by the owner.

80
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,600
So we can only predict that a reaction that is similar to an emotion could develop.

81
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,970
Like or dislike? It could express it.

82
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:30,440
Since our final goal is for the robot to hug and comfort the owner first after their relationship develops.

83
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,130
Hug first?

84
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,030
But it's not a real emotion.

85
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,100
So what you're saying is...

86
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:42,970
If we get really close, is that possible for her to do such things without the owner's command?

87
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:49,320
That's right. If that really happens, we'll end her test and study her in the lab. Why?

88
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,890
Test.

89
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,570
Nothing. It's nothing. Keep working.

90
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:15,760
Seriously. Just how close does she think we are?

91
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,400
As expected, this robot has no common sense.

92
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:32,680
<i>I want to meet the person who invented this umbrella.
</i>

93
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:38,490
This fool. That person is right under your nose.

94
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:44,330
Also, I'm not a robot. I'm a person.

95
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:49,760
When the test is over, I'm going to tell you everything.

96
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,120
The robot seems to like you?

97
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,110
It's not like we're filming a Hollywood movie, so how is that possible?

98
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,360
I already checked it with the research team.

99
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:06,610
So you see, if she succeeds in deep learning, she is able to show emotions.

100
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,850
However...

101
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,650
I think she likes me too much.

102
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,350
Gosh, this is a nuisance.

103
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,400
Are you bragging to me right now that a robot likes you?

104
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,200
Aigoo. What are you saying? This is nothing to brag about.

105
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,570
It's the first time someone has liked you in 15 years.

106
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,960
As soon as I return to Korea, I'll check with my own eyes.

107
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,370
Feeling acceptance from someone is a very good sign.

108
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,610
Hello, Doctor.

109
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,510
- Nice to me you. Everyone's inside.
- Good.

110
00:10:53,510 --> 00:11:00,340
Oh, hi, Doctor. I'm Johnny Brown. This is my girlfriend, Tilda Morton. She's a nurse.

111
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,190
- Thanks for allowing this meeting.
- Yeah, thank you.

112
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,910
Are you all right? Shall we open the window?

113
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:11,360
No, it's okay. I used to have the symptoms whenever I was in the same space with other people,

114
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,410
but it has gotten a lot better and that's all because of Tilda. I mean,

115
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:23,290
she's the only person I trust. I love you Tilda. So, so much.

116
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,530
I love you, too, Johnny.

117
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:28,240
I just can't believe there's another person in the universe that's like me.

118
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,650
My patient is getting better through the assistance of a special robot.

119
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:38,080
Yeah, so I'm guessing to your patient, the robot must be like Tilda is to myself.

120
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:43,220
When the test is over, from where should I begin explaining?

"I'm a person. We are meant to be."

123
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,200
"That umbrella? I made that."

Just you wait, Kim Min Kyu.

126
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:14,250
But did AG-3 kiss me or was it a peck?

127
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:19,090
But will he like that I'm a person?

- It's a kiss.
- Not a peck?

Even if it only passes a second, you should technically consider it a kiss.

00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:06,040
So this is how it feels

155
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,860
to receive one-sided love from someone.

156
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:16,880
It's the feeling of having a hundred tons of gold bars in my house.

157
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,440
<i>We used to go out on dates like that a lot back in the day.</i>

158
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,720
<i>What are you saying? We never came out to this kind of place for dates.</i>

159
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,190
<i>Yes, we have! Think about it carefully.</i>

160
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,430
- <i>You just can't remember it, that's all.</i>
- Where's everyone?

161
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,700
They went out to get coffee, but it seems like they're lost.

162
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,460
What about Jo Ji Ah?

163
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,230
She'll be back soon. She said she had something to do.

164
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,470
Ah, it was such a bother having to take her around places.

165
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,800
You seem to be in a good mood.

166
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,960
What do you mean? It was so annoying having to take care of her and tend to her.

167
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,020
Then don't go.

168
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,600
- What?
- You said it was annoying.

169
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,980
I'll go then next time.

170
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:08,700
For me to tell you to do such a thing is...

171
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,370
It was nice.

172
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,980
Do you want to start again?

173
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,730
Yeah. After spending time with her, it became certain.

174
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,960
Did you find out the reason why she decided to leave you?

175
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:30,850
No. Still, that's all in the past. If we start again well, then—

176
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:36,380
Machines, too, if you don't fix the root of the problem, they keep on breaking.

177
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,440
It could end again for the same reason after hurting each other.

178
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,690
No matter how much I think about it, I don't know.

179
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,080
How about looking for the starting point?

180
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,740
Starting point?

181
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,930
For example, the moment you felt the sorriest toward Jo Ji Ah.

182
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:56,330
If you start there, couldn't you find the reason for the breakup, too?

183
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,120
I love it so much that I can eat the last one.

184
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,660
Punk, there's another one.

185
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,860
What is this? Did something happen to you yesterday? Why are your eyes so red?

186
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:17,430
Oppas, I can't think straight because I went back and forth from a hot tub to a cold one repeatedly yesterday.

187
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:20,790
- Do you—
- Did you go to the sauna yesterday?

188
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,150
You're a robot right now. Please remember that.

189
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:43,330
I have it engraved deep down inside my heart and bones.

190
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:46,550
Where in the world do we have a robot that has red eyes? Open your eyes.

191
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:49,320
- Give it to me. I'll do it myself.
- Open your eyes. I need to take a look at them.

192
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,760
Are you a ghost? Don't open them so wide.

193
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,730
Does it hurt you to say things nicely?

194
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,880
Why would you call me a ghost?

195
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,870
Sorry.

196
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,480
When will AG-3 be completely fixed?

197
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,920
I need to slowly start doing my own things.

198
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,720
It's almost done. Almost.

199
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,010
It will be done by the weekend. I'll make sure it's fixed by then.

200
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,350
Thank you.

201
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,930
You can speak comfortably to me, too.

202
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,210
This is comfortable for me.

203
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:47,590
Did my brother have his first kiss last night?

204
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,350
I'm not quite sure.

205
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,630
It probably wasn't easy for him.

206
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,100
But who knows, the girl might have kissed him first?

207
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:02,050
He needs to have his first kiss, so I can tell him these words.

208
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:05,120
Sun Hye told me that...

209
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,260
<i>The day after the first kiss is important.</i>

210
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,680
<i>If one decides to not remember what happened,</i>

211
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,550
<i>that's when the game of playing hard to get starts.</i>

212
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:19,820
Did you get fully charged throughout the night?

213
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,840
Yes, Master.

214
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,720
All of it was my fault.

215
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:31,730
I gave you the wrong input, so that's why you became this way.

216
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,410
<i>What's wrong with the way I am?</i>

217
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,640
Listen to this well, AG-3.

218
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,220
Open some wires and listen to this very well.

219
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:44,490
You can't love me.

220
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:48,420
Although you can be my closest friend,

221
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,210
you can't be the woman I love.

222
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,730
<i>You were the one that told me to be with you until the day you died.</i>

223
00:19:54,730 --> 00:20:03,060
So you can't do what you did last night ever again, okay?

224
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,720
What do you mean by what I did last night?

225
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,120
- What?
- Did I do something last night?

226
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:17,410
Last night... you... k-ki- me, don't you remember?

227
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:21,340
Did something happen between us last night?

228
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,640
Are you giving me the cold shoulder right now?

229
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,960
Those types of words don't fit you, Master.

230
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,560
Ah, you can't remember because you're in operation mode?

231
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,410
Friend mode.

232
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:35,170
- What?
- What? Your words are getting shorter.

233
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,910
If you called me, then state your business.

234
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,350
Are you mad at me about something?

235
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:44,150
I don't understand what you're trying to say. Can you say it again?

236
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,550
No, why are you switching to operation mode all of a sudden?

237
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:49,830
Due to error, only operation mode is possible for the time being.

238
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:53,000
You must be kidding me. AG-3, friend mode.

239
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,110
Due to error, only operation mode is possible for the time being.

240
00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:01,420
Hey! How c-could you do that do me last night and

241
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,660
be like this? That's rude.

242
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,600
I'm not quite sure what I did, but I won't ever do it again.

243
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,980
Who told you not to do it again?

244
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,270
Then should I do it again?

245
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:14,270
What? What? Do what again? What?

246
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:17,850
You do remember everything you did last night, right?

247
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:21,670
Did something happen last night, Master?

248
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,870
AG-3, you seriously!

249
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,910
I prepared myself so much for my first kiss,

250
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:45,740
but someone intercepted my first kiss.

251
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:50,090
Therefore, I have to prepare myself again.

252
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:53,530
Won't you give me some ideas, Goddess of Kiss?

253
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:56,130
Wow, he is dying from feeling wronged.

254
00:21:56,130 --> 00:22:01,110
Just who could've stolen someone else's first kiss?

255
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,410
I can't even undo this.

256
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:07,320
- Then you have to do it properly this time.
- How?

257
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,810
Have a cozy date where physical contact is possible.

258
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:14,870
For example, a drive.

259
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,530
Are you just going to continue to interrupt?!

260
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:52,380
It's because you keep following and watching me like a dog that I can't do anything!

261
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,950
Then just go by yourself.

262
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:57,190
She needs to be there for me to be able to kiss someone.

263
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,980
You two are having quite a unique fling.

264
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,510
Fling?

265
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,650
She drives me nuts.

266
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,540
I was afraid of this. Did you fix it yet?

267
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,120
I pretended like nothing happened.

268
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,130
I went on pretending like it was erased due to an error.

269
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,160
Hey, how can you pretend like nothing happened?

270
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:30,890
Pi, do I really not talk very nicely?

271
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:35,090
Based on general standards, yes.

272
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,210
How much?

273
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:41,120
Since we're close with you, no matter what you say, we can see the main point.

274
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,130
But normal people find the manners surrounding the context important as well.

275
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,190
Are my manners that bad?

276
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:53,720
Based on general standards, yes.

277
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,450
As for me, I don't see it like that.

278
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,780
I think I found it.

279
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,880
The memory of when I felt sorriest toward Jo Ji Ah.

280
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,790
<i>- You came?
- Why did you do something I didn't ask for? Think before you act!</i>

281
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:13,510
<i>Who told you to clear the stuff here? Are you some maid?</i>

282
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:16,570
How could I not remember after saying something like that?

283
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,630
Are you really human?

284
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:21,870
You're saying that's the reason you broke up?

285
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:32,070
It's not even raining, so why are you holding an umbrella?

286
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:36,510
Take a good look at this umbrella. Doesn't it remind you of something?

287
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,960
Nope.

288
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:46,060
A memory that's related to this umbrella should be stored in the wrong place somewhere.

289
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,280
Hurry up and recall it.

290
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:52,300
I'm not quite sure what you're trying to say.

291
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,900
Even like this?

292
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,190
Hurry up and find that memory.

293
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,880
Is it a memory that I must remember?

294
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,280
No. It's a memory that you must erase.

295
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,790
Then it's already gone, so why are you acting like this?

296
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:23,590
It's a bit... unfair if I only remember it.

297
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,080
Then you should also erase it, Master.

298
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,760
It must be nice that you can erase it.

299
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,990
I'm not a robot like you.

300
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,200
How can I just erase a memory in my head? Just how?

301
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,100
With time. Humans use time to forget a memory.

302
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,450
It's because you don't really understand, but

303
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:46,840
there are some memories that can't be erased even with time.

304
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:51,080
Some memories can be triggered by being at that memory's location or hearing a song from that memory.

305
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,900
Now whenever I look at this umbrella, that memory with you will pop up in my head.

306
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,560
What are you going to do about this?

307
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,030
<i>So he's saying that he doesn't like the memory because he was taken aback, flabbergasted, and dumbfounded.</i>

308
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,500
<i>I hope you never forget it all your life.</i>

309
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,510
So, are you complaining to me?

310
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:10,700
That's right! Don't remember! Don't remember it for the rest of your life.

311
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,790
I dare you to remember it!

312
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:19,290
♫ <i>Will you understand me?</i> ♫

313
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:23,050
♫ <i>Will you see me?</i> ♫

314
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:26,300
♫ <i>To the point my heart is strained in nervousness</i> ♫

315
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:31,300
♫ <i>I love you</i> ♫
