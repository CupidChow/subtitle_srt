1
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:20,590
<i>Finally tonight for an hour, 70 shooting stars are expected to fall.
[Episode 27]</i>

2
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:25,620
<i>According to Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute, the Quadrantids will become visible late tonight.</i>

3
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,870
Oh my! You startled me! Why did you get up and scare me?

4
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,760
I need to go to Mt. Hwangmae.

5
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,810
Are you crazy? Why would you go there at night?

6
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,380
He said he would take me there when the meteor shower comes.

7
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,420
Who?

8
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,720
Monami, my friend.

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:45,650
I think your friend will be meeting with someone else.

10
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,230
Who?

11
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:20,980
♫ <i>I want to tell you</i> ♫

12
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:26,570
♫ <i>I want to call you</i> ♫

13
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:30,760
♫ <i>Lingering right at the edge of my lips</i> ♫

14
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:37,730
♫ <i>Repeating over and over, the words of my heart</i> ♫

15
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:43,350
♫ <i>No matter how much I yell</i> ♫

16
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:48,840
♫ <i>It doesn't seem like you can see my heart</i> ♫

17
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,430
♫ <i>Behind my happy front, an unimaginable amount</i> ♫

18
00:01:54,430 --> 00:02:03,140
♫ <i>Of tears that I had to erase and erase again, you wouldn't know</i> ♫

19
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:08,400
♫ <i>It's the first time having these feelings</i> ♫

20
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,960
♫ <i>Even though I'm by your side, I miss you</i> ♫

21
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,800
♫ <i>Even if it's just once</i> ♫

22
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,700
♫ <i>If I am in your arms and am calling your name</i> ♫

23
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,770
What is it that you want to say?

24
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,360
What did you want to say so badly?

25
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,990
I will say it. I will tell you everything.

26
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:20,330
I had a lot to say, but where do I start?

27
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:25,100
From the start. Since the first day when you came to my house. Tell me.

28
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,800
You. Is there another thing you are hiding from me?

29
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,640
It's not that I tried to hide it from you.

30
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,070
It just so happened that I could not tell you.

31
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:42,710
The first time we met was not when I was a robot but when I was a human.

32
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,050
I met you for the first time when I was Jo Ji Ah, a human.

33
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:52,360
Jo Ji Ah, the one that made the heart balls for the Young Entrepreneur Competition.

34
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,140
You're saying that I have seen that Jo Ji Ah before the final round?

35
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:00,070
The action figure. Proxy shopping. CEO Jo.

36
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:04,390
You met that Jo Ji Ah before.

37
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:09,750
That was the starting point for you and me.

38
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,710
We were not able to meet Brother.

39
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,620
He's not at home either.

40
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,770
I should have chased the car no matter what and apologized earlier.

41
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,620
That might be the last time.

42
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:41,800
Will we... even have a chance to apologize to him properly?

43
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,550
If we have a chance, that would be great; but even if we don't...

44
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,080
Well, that's up to Brother.

45
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,480
Even just once, I hope he will meet with us.

46
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,740
If not, I feel like I will tear up each time I think of him.

47
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:07,290
Looking at it up close it is misery, but looking at it from afar, it is comedy. What is it?

48
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,580
Life.

49
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,810
C'est la vie.

50
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,370
CEO Jo?

51
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,710
You are that CEO Jo?

52
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,530
Impossible. No.

53
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,060
We talked so many times on the phone. There's no way I wouldn't have known.

54
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,710
<i>Instead of having people like you by my side I would rather have a robot!</i>

55
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,530
<i>What's wrong with me? What makes me worse than that robot?</i>

56
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,520
<i>What is it?</i>

57
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,310
<i>You haven't taken out the necklace yet.</i>

58
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,560
<i>How did you know that there is a necklace in there?</i>

59
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,640
Now...

60
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,750
do you remember?

61
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,840
If what you are saying is true...

62
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,830
- To you, I...
<i>- Usually, </i>

63
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:02,770
<i>if the lips touch...</i>

64
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,260
<i>would it be a kiss?</i>

65
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,870
<i>Joooook?</i>

66
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,620
I even said those words to you?

67
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,320
No, no, wait!

68
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:28,140
This. This doesn't make sense. When AG-3 was being delivered I was on the phone talking to CEO Jo.

69
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,160
That's right. I was on the phone with you.

70
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,210
I told you to go to the hospital.

71
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,700
But AG-3 was inside that box.

72
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,060
I was on the phone inside that box.

73
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,210
But when the box opened and you were in front of my eyes,

74
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:43,240
I was so surprised. That's why...

75
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,790
<i>Oh my!</i>

76
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,200
That time, I was sure I was caught without a way out.

77
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,900
Doctor Hong said that friend mode would pop out.

78
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,240
But you believed that.

79
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,580
Then... that normally doesn't exist?

80
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,250
It was a made up excuse because of me.

81
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,060
That means I'm a fool?

82
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,610
I was taken aback too when you believed it.

83
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,990
How... How did I not know that?

84
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,080
<i>Master, you farted.</i>

85
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,530
<i>- I did?
- Yes.</i>

86
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,170
<i>I didn't though.</i>

87
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,520
<i>Then would it be me?</i>

88
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,680
<i>There's no way it would be you.</i>

89
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,290
Whoa! The fart!

90
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,810
Where could you find a robot in this world that frames you for farting?

91
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,800
You!

92
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:57,350
Must have thought that I was pretty dimwitted.

93
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,930
I told you to only say the truth.

94
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,960
I thought how in the world could there be such a fool--

95
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,850
Just until there.

96
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,440
Now, do you believe?

97
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,110
No! I don't believe.

98
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,350
Rather than you being CEO Jo, you...

99
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,810
I can't believe myself for believing that you were a robot.

100
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,970
Well, I also could not believe it.

101
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,120
<i>Who would have thought it was such a smart robot.</i>

102
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,600
- It was my first time hearing someone tell me that I was smart—
- Just until there!

103
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,170
♫ <i>Will you understand me? Will you see me?</i> ♫

104
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:41,130
And also, my brother. He really did not know that I was doing this part-time job.

105
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,400
My brother is not that kind of person.

106
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,590
He didn't tell you about AG-3 and me having the same face

107
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,920
was for my sake. Really.

108
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,190
How can I believe that?

109
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,470
If not...

110
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,790
<i>Thank y--</i>

111
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:02,360
Why would I place my hair like that?

112
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,940
I believed even after I saw that?

113
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,000
You! Did you call me out to tell me how much of a fool I am?

114
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,660
You called me out though.

115
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,980
Are you sure Jang Doo Sam lives there?

116
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,890
Because it's information from Madam-X.

117
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:38,750
Ma-Madam-X?

118
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,880
I don't know about her that well either.

119
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,090
I just know that she's a sound informant.

120
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:47,480
But will you be able to convince Jang Doo Sam?

121
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,680
I have to. It's our last hope.

122
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,060
Yes, Pi.

123
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,980
It's the best space I have seen so far.

124
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,860
There's enough space for AG-3's energy--

125
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,480
We decided to send AG-3, right? I'm sorry.

126
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,470
Sign the contract. If you say it's all right, then it should be.

127
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,390
Sun Hye, a cup of Americano, please.

128
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,110
Yes.

129
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:25,310
Did you get a storage place?

130
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,830
I signed a contract.

131
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:31,720
We can move after sending AG-3 to President Hwang.

132
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,190
But then, is she out of battery?

133
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:41,180
She kept saying that she needs to go somewhere, so I put her in standby mode because it was annoying.

134
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:46,420
Once Director Martin takes her away, she will probably be taken apart to the point that we won't recognize her.

135
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,990
Even if AG-3's technology will get sold in pieces,

136
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,060
I hope that they will be used to benefit many people.

137
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,860
I'm sorry AG-3.

138
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,630
Americano.

139
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,990
Thank you.

140
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,500
Later, during the meteor shower, let's make a wish.

141
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,170
Who knows? One of our wishes might come true.

142
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,950
Okay. Now that the situation has ended up like this, let's just spill everything here.

143
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,750
Tell me. What else did you lie to me about?

144
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,430
I didn't lie to you,

145
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,970
but there is something I stole from you.

146
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,480
Stole? What is it?

147
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,330
Ah, don't misunderstand. It's not something like that.

148
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,070
Are you an onion?

149
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,440
How can there be more layers even after I peel them?

150
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,410
I stole something you threw away.

151
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,380
What did I throw away?

152
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:45,930
You know that one time, you threw away Korean beef that had one day left before its expiration date.

153
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,550
You threw away this and that, all in the trash bin.

154
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:52,000
You took that with you?

155
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,730
It looked delicious.

156
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:58,560
Along with lettuce and a little bit of alcohol.

157
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,290
Seriously.

158
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,860
You're laughing?

159
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:12,320
However, how did you manage to hold it in when you wanted to eat the food I made?

160
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,890
I was able to resolve my grudge at Geoje Island.

161
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,090
It was really, extremely delicious.

162
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:27,700
What else is there? Quickly tell me all of it.

163
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,510
There's nothing.

164
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,760
Nothing?

165
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,460
Nothing.

166
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:44,430
You're saying there's really nothing left, right?

167
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,870
Who is Hong Joo?

168
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,820
There is something I wanted to ask you.

169
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,140
Ah, go ahead.

170
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:03,270
Why aren't you mad at me?

171
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,460
I was expecting to get hit.

172
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:10,100
As a lawyer, you have to see both the perspectives of the assailant and the victim.

173
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,940
That's why I was able to see that

174
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,970
you started off wrong, but in the amount of time you spent together,

175
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,700
sincerity for one another exists.

176
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,370
That's why, I felt bad.

177
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:27,490
Towards Chairman Kim Min Kyu, my younger sister, and Santa Maria Team, too.

178
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,880
However, do you know this?

179
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,690
The moment someone's sincerity gains its power

180
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,340
is when that someone is in a time of crisis.

181
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:42,770
So I don't believe that Chairman Kim Min Kyu

182
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:46,320
is the only one that has the key to solve this situation.

183
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,670
That's a bit harsh.

184
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:53,350
As much as you are sincere, you need to take responsibility.

185
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:57,300
The lawsuit will be filed with the court tomorrow.

186
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,960
Yes.

187
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,600
Fine. Then when you were a human being,

188
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,990
what were your impressions of me?

189
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,930
I thought you were a dine-and-dash jerk.

190
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:14,260
- What?
- You didn't give me the remaining amount of money, and ran away. So I misunderstood you.

191
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,200
Plus, I didn't know about your allergy at that time, either.

192
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:23,350
Of course, my misunderstanding was resolved after I saw the action figure box at your house.

193
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:26,590
- After that?
- After that...

194
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,160
I thought you were a crazy psycho.

195
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,050
I mean, it's true.

196
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,360
You would celebrate the birthday of your vacuum cleaner,

197
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,480
and say things like there is a hierarchy within this house and whatnot.

198
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,300
How would a man like that seem normal to me?

199
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,410
You told me to be honest.

200
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,190
After that?

201
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:53,250
However starting at some point,

202
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,840
because of you, my heart felt sad for you.

203
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,170
At first, I was dumbfounded and confused by everything you said.

204
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:11,260
But then at one point, it all started to sound sad.

205
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:18,670
Therefore, the more I saw you

206
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,150
and the more I got to know you,

207
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,170
my heart ached for you.

208
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,590
So?

209
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:35,190
So I started to hope that you would find happiness.

210
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,520
And?

211
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,850
If you could become happy,

212
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:46,840
I wanted to do everything I could for you.

213
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,960
Your voice is too quiet, so I can't hear you.

214
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,860
Come next to me.

215
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,700
Tell me again.

216
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,790
From the very beginning.

217
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:41,200
As you suggested, we will forgo your engagement to Kim Min Kyu.

218
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,240
You were so sincere about it, so how can I say no?

219
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,440
Are you being serious, Dad?

220
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,210
Kim Min Kyu will probably be dismissed from KM Financial soon.

221
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:55,430
Then Yoo Cheol will come back again.

222
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:59,200
You look better with Yoo Cheol than with Kim Min Kyu anyway.

223
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,850
What do you mean by Yoo Cheol? Why are you talking about him all of a sudden?

224
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,620
Guests will be arriving soon. Welcome them when they get here.

225
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,000
Hey, Ri El. It's been a long time.

226
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,910
Yes, President.

227
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,220
What do you mean by "President?"

228
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,220
During personal business, you can call me "Mister" like you did when you were younger.

229
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,200
Well soon enough, you should call me "Father-in-law."

230
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,270
What?

231
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:29,110
Okay. Let's talk it out slowly as we enjoy our meal.

232
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,470
- Shall we?
- Yes.

233
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,990
I'm sorry. Please excuse me for a moment.

234
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,310
Ye Ri El.

235
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,770
- Wait.
- Shut up. Don't say anything.

236
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,370
You are just like them, too.

237
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:57,290
I also didn't— I-I- also didn't know that this was going to be that kind of setting.

238
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:00,290
I can't trust your words either now.

239
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:04,390
I don't even know if you're still the same

240
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,440
Hwang Yoo Cheol that I once knew.

241
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,710
Besides being sad because of me,

242
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,760
was there ever a time your heart fluttered because of me?

243
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:30,410
There are small instances. Nothing really that special.

244
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:34,490
Just tell me everything.

245
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:39,180
I want to know about the things I didn't know while I was with you.

246
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:51,410
In the morning, every time I was coming to you, my heart fluttered.

247
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,740
When you told me I was your treasure and to stay with you forever,

248
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:07,210
it felt like I was getting proposed to.

249
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:10,260
- When you got hurt while cooking to try and protect me,
<i>- Did you cut yourself?</i>

250
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,470
<i>Why are you cooking so aggressively?</i>

251
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:17,250
I felt like you were my knight.

252
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:21,950
Also, you know when I saved you from the allergy reaction you were having?

253
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,760
At that time,

254
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:30,400
"There is a man in this world that can smile like that,"

255
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,530
is what I thought.

256
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,100
♫ <i>How and what kind of person can do it?</i> ♫

257
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,710
At that time, weren't you scared?
♫ <i>I'm very jealous</i> ♫

258
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:43,540
Honestly, I was scared.

259
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,060
♫ <i>Because</i> ♫

260
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,200
However, I thought of what you told me before.

261
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,450
<i>No matter how much I change,</i>

262
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:57,580
<i>I hope you are able to recognize me.</i>

263
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:04,670
How earnest you were when you said that,

264
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,110
I realized then.

265
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:13,190
♫ <i>When meeting someone</i> ♫

266
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:18,310
- What else?
♫ <i>Because I don't want my heart to get hurt</i> ♫

267
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:24,030
When you would stroke my head, my heart fluttered and I was happy.

268
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,220
Do you know that?

269
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,130
At first, I really hated it.

270
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:33,170
However when I got used to it,

271
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:36,710
I would feel disappointed when you didn't stroke my head.

272
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,310
What else?

273
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:44,470
Also, that day when you were drunk

274
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:47,760
and told me that you wished I was human...

275
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,790
<i>Fold a finger </i>

276
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:55,440
<i>if you wish that robot was human.</i>

277
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:02,100
At that time, I thought my heart was going to explode.

278
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,940
♫ <i>It's very weird</i> ♫

279
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:09,160
I felt really sorry and happy.

280
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,440
♫ <i>Giving my heart</i> ♫

281
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:18,030
That's why I rested my head next to yours and said this...

♫ <i>What kind of person can do it?</i> ♫

293
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:01,810
We're too much of a burden by being at your store, right?

294
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:07,590
I'm sorry. If you cut us some slack for a few days, then we'll move out.

295
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:11,310
That's all right. It feels like there are a lot of customers, so I like it.

296
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:17,000
Your hair, is it naturally curly like that?

297
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,960
Yes, it's all because of genetics.

298
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,530
You're even pretty now but if you straighten out your hair a little then I think your face can look more lively.

299
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,080
I feel like it's a shame.

300
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:36,220
Sun Hye, you said that you have a lot of dating experience, but how come you don't have someone in your life right now?

301
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,830
It's because I have this chronicle illness.

302
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:43,470
At first I catch the person because he sparkles.

303
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:48,030
But at some point when I look at my hands, it's just a rock.

304
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,850
This has been my dating experience up until now.

305
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:54,440
They say that originally the dust of stars that gather together become people.

306
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,350
The star is inside of you, so why would you want to go look for it externally?

307
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:04,410
- Should we date?
- Sure.

308
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,150
Huh?!

309
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,400
Your answer is?

310
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,440
If you really want me then I suppose so.

311
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:24,270
Ear, ear, ear.

312
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,230
Sleep.

313
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:40,400
So I couldn't say anything to you when I was getting reset.

314
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:49,410
I couldn't tell you the truth so I really felt bad.

315
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:58,310
You went through a lot, didn't you?

316
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,670
It was bearable.

317
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,780
I liked watching you,

318
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,460
and I also liked you watching me.

319
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:21,650
To the point that I forgot that I was deceiving you. It was a price to pay.

320
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:27,660
I'm so sorry for pretending not to know you till the very end

321
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:32,570
when you followed me all the way to Geoje Island.

322
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,570
When you called me...

323
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:43,070
"Hi, AG-3."

324
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:48,580
I felt like my heart was crumbling down.

325
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,790
Also, at the warehouse that day,

326
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:02,470
I was so worried that I might get caught by you and you would face trouble.

327
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,140
But because I was able to see your face,

328
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:17,310
because I was able to hear your voice, I was so happy.

329
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:25,200
The fact that time was passing by, it was such a shame.

330
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:35,380
I should've at least told you the truth then and there.

331
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,460
I'm so sorry.

332
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,330
I'm here now.

333
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:45,540
What I really wanted to tell you the most will start right now.

334
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:50,170
That day, the day that was raining,

335
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,550
you put the umbrella over me, remember?

336
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:01,440
- That day, I kissed you--
- Stop right there!

337
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:08,930
When it comes to the best gift, you're supposed to just leave it be.

338
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:14,990
When it comes to a gift like that, I don't want to even open it up and just keep it.

339
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:35,990
Thank you for telling me honestly.

340
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:38,270
Thank you for letting me know everything that I wanted to know

341
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:46,080
and for making the time I had with you go from a horrible memory

342
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,510
to a beautiful memory that I can keep for the rest of my life.

343
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,540
With just that memory, I will now

344
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:05,560
be able to endure the time that I have left well.

345
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,710
What do you mean by that?

346
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:18,220
Now we should go back to our respective lives.

347
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,540
I'm asking you what you mean by that!

348
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:27,510
Maybe I won't be able to ever touch you again in all eternity.

349
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,840
♫ <i>That it's enough to see the shadows</i> ♫

350
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:35,030
I can't bring you into what I had to endure for the last fifteen years.

351
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,260
♫ <i>My heart that was strong</i> ♫

352
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,580
So...

353
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:43,790
this is our end.

354
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,450
♫ <i>I loved with all my heart today, too</i> ♫

355
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:55,130
I won't be able to see the meteor shower with you.

356
00:29:55,130 --> 00:30:01,430
That... will become too much of a heart-wrenching memory.

357
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,380
So...

358
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:10,720
our memory together will end right here.

359
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,620
♫ <i>Can't you give it out?</i> ♫

360

♫ <i>You should be able to see me</i> ♫

367

To me, the person who gave me the love I wanted to receive all my life is you!

368
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:52,300
So to me, you're the one that I miss every single day!

369
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:07,920
It's not because you need me but I need you so very much!

370
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:15,250
Because you are the one that I've been looking for till now

371
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:20,120
and the one I've been waiting for till now.

♫ <i>A night without sleep</i> ♫

You don't know, right?

374
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:28,590
How much I wanted to say these words, too, when you were resetting me.

375

♫ <i>Was this just a novel that I wrote myself?</i> ♫

We didn't get to see the shooting stars.

390
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,410
We needed to make a wish.

391
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:16,900
My wish came true just now.

392
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:20,150
What was it?
