1
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,930
I don't know what happened.

2
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,680
But you shouldn't push someone who is so desperate.

3
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,990
<i>The caller that you're trying to reach is unavailable.</i>

4
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,460
<i>This is Jo Ji Ah. I'm on Geoje Island. </i>

5
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,310
<i>Kim Min Kyu is here!</i>

6
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,470
<i>He hasn't caught on but what do I do now? </i>

7
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,420
What is it that you want to say?

8
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,750
<i>[Doctor Hong Baek Gyun]</i>

9
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,310
Ah... why isn't she picking up?

10
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,440
What's the problem this time?

11
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,250
Kim Min Kyu and Jo Ji Ah are together right now.

12
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,150
- What?!
- Oh god.

13
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,680
Yes, Doctor Oh. Kim Min Kyu and Jo Ji Ah are together right now.

14
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,780
What are you saying? Where and how?

15
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,610
No. Before that, have you been able to get in touch with Jo Ji Ah?

16
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,640
She won't pick up?

17
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,200
However and whenever you get in touch with her, please tell her this.

18
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,890
No matter what happens, she has to pretend until the end.

19
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,510
To not act like AG-3.

20
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,020
To not to say or do what AG-3 did.

21
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:10,130
Not long ago... I lost a friend of mine.

22
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:18,490
A friend that helped me come out into this world after 15 years.

23
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,010
That's too bad.

24
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,830
However, what does that have to do with me?

25
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:33,860
You feel like that friend.

26
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:50,320
Sometimes, ridiculous things happen in this world.

27
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,510
Things that people won't believe

28
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,960
unless they experience it.

29
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:01,150
That friend and I spent moments together

30
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,310
that were like a miracle.

31
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,360
What are you saying?

32
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,150
Excuse me, I think you really should go see a doctor.

33
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,660
I'll tell you about a nearby hospital, so please leave.

34
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,450
I called this friend this way, "Hi,

35
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,610
AG-3."

36
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,790
Ah, now I understand

37
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,670
why you are acting this way.

38
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:55,920
By any chance, do you know Doctor Hong Baek Gyun?

39
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,960
Ah, you do.

40
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,600
Then, you must also know that AG-3 is a robot.

41
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,940
Do you also know this?

42
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,290
<i>By any chance, if you ever run into Kim Min Kyu, tell him this...</i>

43
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,790
That I'm that robot's character model?

44
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,460
Four years ago, I got paid ₩10,000,000 for that part-time job.

45
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,660
Therefore, the person that's standing in front of you right now is

46
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,010
not a robot, but instead a person. Okay?

47
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,390
I know.

48
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,090
That you are the character model.

49
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:30,130
You knew, but why are you being so rude and making me feel uncomfortable?

50
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,130
I apologize.

51
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,570
If you're apologetic, then leave.

52
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,320
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,310
If you're sorry, then leave.

54
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,010
Can't I just stay here and look at you, Hong Joo?

55
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:50,370
When I get tired of it, I'll just take my leave.

56
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,340
So you w-want to l-look at m-me.

57
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,590
Why would you look at me?

58
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:05,730
Well because... I'm just very amazed.

59
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,000
- Get up.
- What?

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,120
Before I use force, get up!

61
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,310
W-Wait a minute, Hong Joo. Wait!

62
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,550
Wait. Wait, Hong Joo.

63
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,230
Hey, you crazy bastard. Look at what?!

64
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,770
Are you some rising star in the stalker world?!

65
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,930
You're laughing?

66
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,380
You must not have fully learned your lesson, huh?

67
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,470
Listen to me. My face is mine.

68
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,450
The robot that you're thinking about isn't me.

69
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,900
Ah! Seriously. I shouldn't have taken that part-time job!

70
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:44,290
It didn't even cross my mind that a strange person would come looking for me.

71
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,280
Do you know how creepy it is

72
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,630
when a stranger comes up to you and acts like he knows you?

73
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,280
- Give me a room.
- What?

74
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,940
There's lodging.

75
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,110
Give me a room where I can stay.

76
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,070
<i>Ah, just leave, please...</i>

77
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,270
There's no room!

78
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,380
But it looks like all the rooms are vacant.

79
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,230
Hey- H-Hong—

80
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,640
I will go with you.

81
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,940
- We will, too.
- We will, too.

82
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,720
You guys stay here.

83
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,880
You guys should stay here and watch the lab.

84
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,330
Hey—

85
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,570
Make sure another hacking doesn't occur.

86
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,040
How is she with Brother?

87
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,890
That's what I'm wondering.

88
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,890
You don't honestly think something will happen, right?

89
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,590
Pi!

90
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,790
You have been lacking sleep for the past couple of days.

91
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,370
What will you do if you doze off behind the wheel?

92
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,410
If you want to go, take me with you.

93
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:48,150
If you don't want to take me, then you can't leave. Ever.

94
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,790
Aigoo... she's so stubborn.

95
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,840
Where is Jo Ji Ah right now on Geoje Island, Sun Hye?

96
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,010
<i>Your caller could not be connected...</i>

97
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:21,380
Do you think Ji Ah put on a strong defense?

98
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,920
Although her probability of her succeeding is below ten percent,

99
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,850
Kim Min Kyu's clueless trait is a variable.

100
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,950
I calculate that the success rate will rise to thirty percent.

101
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,090
Jo Ji Ah's unpredictable actions are another variable, bringing the rate down to fifteen percent.

102
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:39,880
No, his clueless trait is so strong, so it will be around twenty-five percent.

103
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,240
Fifteen percent.

104
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,400
Twenty-five percent.

105
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,910
Fifteen percent.

106
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,470
Twenty-five.

107
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:02,090
Wow. He's like a leech and just won't leave.

108
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,610
Yeah, Sun Hye?

109
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,120
Hey, why weren't you answering your phone?!

110
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,410
How is the situation right now?

111
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,700
For now, I kicked him out.

112
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,330
I told Mold your location, so he's probably on the way there right now.

113
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,200
Is it okay for him to come down?

114
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,810
We have to come down.

115
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,500
You told him you're the character model, right?

116
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,430
Yes, Unni. I think he believes it.

117
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,460
Listen to me well.

118
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,510
You called me because you got angry at Kim Min Kyu, so that's why I'm on the way there.

119
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,390
If Kim Min Kyu comes back in, get angry no matter what.

120
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,300
I was being very angry.

121
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,010
I already tried and it didn't work.

122
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,960
It's like he doesn't understand the words I'm saying at all.

123
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,140
Get as angry as you possibly can.

124
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,750
Also, this is what Doctor Oh told me,

125
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,760
don't say or do anything that AG-3 would do.

126
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,370
Okay, I'll be careful. Ah, should I just run away?

127
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:58,520
Kim Min Kyu's IQ is over 150. I'm certain that moment you run away, he will be suspicious of you.

128
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,760
Ah, I feel so suffocated I could die.

129
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,490
You said it has lodging, right? Go into your room and don't come out until we get there.

130
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:10,930
Okay. How can this happen to me? Seriously.

131
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,730
- Miss Hong Joo!
- Oh my! Oh my!!!

132
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,850
What is déjà-vu?

133
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:29,090
I heard it wrong, right? Please tell me I did.

134
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:32,020
It happened, Doctor.

135
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,580
Oh god.

136
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:47,290
AG-3 reacted the same way you did

137
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:50,710
when we first met. Ah, that's not right.

138
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,280
Was it the second time we met?

139
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,880
Wh-What a-are you doing here?

140
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,590
I left my coat and bag here.

141
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,190
Then take them quickly and leave.

142
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,020
I didn't finish my sashimi yet, though.

143
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,440
- Then, I'll pack it up for you.
- No, I'm going to finish it all before I leave.

144
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,490
This place closes.

145
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:15,820
Ah, I'll finish it all before it does.

146
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,570
He didn't leave and came back again.

147
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:44,530
Listen to me well. Since the situation has become like this, just do what you do normally.

148
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:47,980
I already told him that not only does AG-3 have your face, but your personality and habits, too.

149
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,040
However, keep this in mind.

150
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,320
You don't know anything he said or did to you, okay?

151
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,990
The moment you get caught from that, he will know that you're AG-3.

152
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,220
Thanks for the bread.

153
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,620
How much of Ji Ah's defenses have gone down?

154
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,530
- The first line is down already.
- As for the second and last line, they are still secure.

155
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,790
Thank you.

156
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,510
- Have some of this, Sun Hye.
- I'm on a diet.

157
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:22,420
So, in the end, will they be able to fool Kim Min Kyu completely?

158
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,320
We were able to fool him when Ji Ah was pretending to be a robot.

159
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,900
He's going to be fooled. He will. He has to.

160
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,780
That's when he was living alone for a long time, so he was a bit weird.

161
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,070
Now he has advanced significantly.

162
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,900
Aigoo... My heart is pounding like crazy. Aigoo.

163
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:42,950
The question is if he's still clueless or not.

164
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,990
Dong Won, am I the only thing you see?

165
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:57,070
<i>Dong Won... Dong Won... Dong Won...</i>

166
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:02,130
Why are you frozen? What are you doing? Why are you zoning out? Come to your senses.

167
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:06,940
I was always looking at you, Sun Hye. I always see you.

168
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,560
I know. Yes, thank you.

169
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,250
You knew, but you still act like that?

170
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:27,510
You should drink some water while you're eating. Don't choke.

171
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,900
Thank you.

172
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,630
Take the wagon to the public warehouse for me.

173
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,410
Woo Shik's family will be using it tomorrow.

174
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,620
While you're at it, bring some baskets to dry the fish in.

175
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,550
- Yes, I'll clean up here then go.
- Boss!

176
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,660
- Do you have a room?
- A lot.
- No.

177
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,690
Which room would you like?

178
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,330
Should I give you a room where you can see the sea?

179
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,150
Yes.

180
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:02,600
What are you doing? Why aren't you leading him to his room?

181
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,870
- Is there no bed?
- No, there isn't. You're leaving now, right?

182
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,090
I'll just sleep like this.

183
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,930
There's a lot of better hotels besides this place.

184
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:33,490
Whether it's a hotel or here, they're all worse than my house anyway.

185
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:37,590
<i>As expected, his speech is still the same as before. </i>

186
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,580
- Then, rest well.
- Wait!

187
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:45,270
Uhm, is there any coffee?

188
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,730
If you go out to the front, there's a vending machine.

189
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:52,010
- You just need ₩200.
- Excuse me.

190
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:58,590
I don't have any coins.

191
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,060
It's a freebie.

192
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,840
- Yes?
- You're at Geoje Island, right?

193
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,870
Oh? How did you know I'm at Geoje Island?

194
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,600
I got a call from the character model part-timer.

195
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,200
<i>She said there was a weird man that appeared and said that she's like AG-3.</i>

196
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,950
<i>And that she's scared, so come and take him.</i>

197
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,360
This is why you called me this afternoon, right?

198
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,140
We just met coincidentally on the train.

199
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:01,960
I was very shocked by how similar they looked.

200
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:08,030
By the time I came back to my senses, I was at Geoje Island.

201
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:12,800
You can't do that. Do you know how shocked that part-timer must be?

202
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,530
Ah, was she that shocked?

203
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:20,460
Of course! If it were you, wouldn't you feel the same?

204
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,700
That's true. You have a point.

205
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,750
However, that's why I told her the truth about why I was like that.

206
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,510
Th-That seriously won't do. I am on my way there, so let's meet up and talk.

207
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,070
- What? You're coming here?
- That's right.

208
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,350
Do you think I'd stay in Seoul in this situation? Just stay put there.

209
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,910
Also, stop bugging that part-timer.

210
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,640
Ah, I- I- I-...

211
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,870
Yes, Doctor. Did you call me?

212
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,710
You're doing well, right?

213
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:00,170
- Of course.
- Do you carry a syringe and medication around?

214
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,730
Since you don't know what might happen, you have to make sure you carry that around for the time being.

215
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,070
No, I don't carry them with me.

216
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,390
Patient Kim Min Kyu!

217
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:12,160
Don't worry. I do carry them.

218
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,640
Team Leader Jo?

219
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,740
Yes, Chairman. I called you earlier, but since you didn't pick up, I couldn't report back to you.

220
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,210
Let's talk about that later.

221
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:44,840
Before that, when you were looking into the Santa Maria Team,

222
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,680
did you find anything about AG-3's character model?

223
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,650
So what I'm saying is, is there a real person

224
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,250
that looks like AG-3?

225
00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:00,030
- What?
- Her name is Hong Joo, but I don't know her surname.

226
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,630
- Hong Joo?
- Me?

227
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,490
Do you remember?

228
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,930
Ah... yes.

229
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:13,660
It's true that AG-3 was modeled after a real person.

230
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,800
I'm very sure about that.

231
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,800
I see.

232
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,870
If you also say so,

233
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:25,200
then I guess that must be it.

234
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,350
I understand.

235
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:39,530
Honey. What is it?

236
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:45,010
I mean, why does my name come up?

237
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,520
Can you stop the car by the convenience store really quick?

238
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,560
Fine. Do you need to buy something?

239
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,680
<i>Why aren't you picking up, Angela?</i>

240
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,540
<i>Professor wants me to ask you about becoming a full-time professor again.</i>

241
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,960
<i>He said it's such a good opportunity, so why aren't you doing it?</i>

242
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,230
Drink this and drive.

243
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,300
Leave it there.

244
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,810
Drink it. Hurry up.

245
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,850
Why are you getting angry?

246
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,690
Hurry up and drink it.

247
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:03,010
Okay. I'll drink it.

248
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,070
Ah, what's wrong with this?!

249
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,360
Drink it all. All of it.

250
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,670
Only then you can drive at night. My life is on the line, too.

251
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,350
You can leave now.

252
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,830
Okay...

253
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,710
I think I have something.
<i> [Monami Copying / Copy Completed]</i>

254
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,490
Can you save it?

255
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,440
I just need the password and I'll be fine.

256
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,590
So about that time, during the moonlit date, where did you go, Sun Hye?

257
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:47,370
- She didn't go anywhere.
- Be quiet, please.

258
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,480
- Please tell me honestly.
- Ah, seriously.

259
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,730
You just went to the restroom, right?

260
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,160
Yeah, I went to the restroom.
<i>[MONAMI folder has been leaked.]</i>

261
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,700
Did you really go to poop?
<i>[MONAMI folder has been leaked.]</i>

262
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,620
- We're drinking coffee right now.
- Seriously...

263
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,870
What's happening with the car?

264
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,530
The car just broke down, right?

265
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:18,230
I was surprised it lasted this long.

266
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,670
Why are you like this to me?

267
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,410
Coffee has to be sweet for it to be delicious.

268
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,450
Thank you.

269
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,940
This is really delicious.

270
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,460
I'm going to stop by the warehouse now, Grandma.

271
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:57,540
Wait! Last time I noticed that the light bulb in the spooky warehouse kept going on and off.

272
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,380
That won't do. I'll go with you.

273
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,470
No. I'll go by myself.

274
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,210
- Excuse me, young man.
- Yes?

275
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:07,070
I don't want my granddaughter to go alone at night,

276
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,150
so would you mind going with her?

277
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:11,860
Grandma!

278
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:16,610
Of course! I have a lot of time on my hands. Let's go, Hong Joo.

279
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,320
Go quickly.

280
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,530
Go quickly.

281
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,230
Hurry up.

282
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:45,150
<i>From now on, I will pick you up every day. That way we can save some battery.</i>

283
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:48,590
<i>Is it because I'm your treasure?</i>

284
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:52,130
<i>No. Be prepared to be scolded when we get to the house.</i>

285
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:55,620
<i>It's not right to scold without a reason, Master.</i>

286
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,900
Why are you laughing?

287
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,510
You also laughed.

288
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,940
I have a good enough reason to be laughing.

289
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,690
Will you not talk to me? I'm driving and it distracts me.

290
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:12,410
I'm here to look after you, Hong Joo.

291
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,050
Did anyone ask for your help?

292
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,730
No, but technically, shouldn't you be thankful?

293
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,440
Do you force people to be thankful towards you?

294
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,610
- Is your personality usually like this?
- What's wrong with my personality?

295
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:25,850
AG-3 would say whatever she wanted but was cute even so.

296
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:30,530
Now that we spent some time together, I can see the difference between you and AG-3.

297
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:35,190
If I stay longer, will I see more?

298
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:38,920
<i>Darn it. Should I be happy to hear this or not?</i>

299
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,370
About AG-3—

300
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,130
Are you getting revenge through your driving?

301
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:51,270
I'm just a terrible driver, that's all.

302
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:23,060
I must have left it in my apron.

303
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:28,990
Excuse me, can you turn on the flashlight on your phone?

304
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,590
I don't have much battery.

305
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:37,290
I'll buy you a new one. A fully charged one. Turn it on quickly.

306
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:44,130
Where are the baskets?

307
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,340
It smells bad.

308
00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:00,880
Seriously, people... If you're done using the storage room, you should shut the door.

309
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,130
Hey—

310
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,760
Hey! There's someone in here!

311
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,520
There's someone in here!

312
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,050
Hey! There's someone in here!

313
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,030
Hey!

314
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:43,510
<i>Did I just get locked up in the storage room alone with him?</i>

315
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:50,230
<i>This can't be. I'll either die from suffocation or the cold by tomorrow.</i>

316
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:58,550
♫ <i>I want to tell you</i> ♫

317
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:04,210
♫ <i>I want to call you</i> ♫

318
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:08,410
♫ <i>Lingering right at the edge of my lips</i> ♫

319
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:15,350
♫ <i>Repeating over and over the words of my heart</i> ♫

320
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:20,210
♫ <i>No matter how much I yell</i> ♫

321
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:26,530
♫ <i>It doesn't seem like you can see my heart</i> ♫

322
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:32,120
♫ <i>Behind my happy front an unimaginable amount</i> ♫

323
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:32,860
<i>[I Am Not a Robot]</i>

324
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,230
<i>Then do you want to be my friend?</i>

325
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,480
<i>I don't have a lover.</i>

326
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,990
<i>I'm starting to become greedy.</i>

327
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:41,110
<i>Who do you miss the most right now?</i>

328
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,700
<i>Kim Min Kyu.</i>

329
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:48,400
<i>If I tell him everything honestly, do you think he will forgive me and trust me again?</i>

330
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,300
<i>Do you miss me that much?</i>

331
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:54,620
<i>But I can't do that, right?</i>

332
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,970
<i>I finally found you.</i>

333
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:57,940
<i>I-I'll explain everything.</i>

334
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,460
<i>I was fooled all along?</i>

335
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:05,510
♫ <i>I want to tell you</i> ♫

336
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:08,900
♫ <i>I want to let you hear</i> ♫
