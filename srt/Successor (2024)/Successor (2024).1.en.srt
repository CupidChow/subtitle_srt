Be careful, son.

Jiye,

14
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,540
have you had lunch?

15
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,750
Where are your parents?

Still in bed.

17

I'll go wake them.

Guess we came early.

00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,120
Do they have a different body clock?

20
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:27,870
This way, please.

Mr. Ma,

22

we just want to lend a hand

23

34
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,910
I'll pay for it.

35
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,450
I appreciate your kindness,

36
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,580
but we really don't need help.

37
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,080
Put simply.

38
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,790
This decor you're seeing

39
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,000
is a choice our family made.

40
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,290
So, I'd rather

41
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,160
our quiet, simple life not be disturbed.

hold your kid back, okay?

44
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,080
Here's the thing.

45
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,200
Jiye's getting self-conscious.

46
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,700
He won't even speak up

47
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,830
in English class.

48
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,660
How about this?

online lessons from great teachers.

53
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:03,830
Your boy can just

54
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,080
grab a chair and sit aside.

55
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,540

Have some coffee.

This one's Jamaican beans
from this year,

60
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,000
and this one's made from Yunnan beans.

61

They're both great in their own way.

62
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,370

This is a Cohiba.

66
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,290
I don't want Chenggang to smoke
too much.

67
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,290
It's bad for his health.

00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,250

76
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,410
Nothing big.

78
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,000
I have about a dozen stores
around the province.

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,620
Small business indeed, right?

80
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,080
But hey,

81

82
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,120
If you ever run into trouble,

83
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,580
Chenggang can lend you a hand.

84
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,750
And what's he going to pull me into?

85
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,750
I'm sorry, Ms. Ding

86
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:06,750

Didn't you guys just wake up?

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,410
Can I play a round?

92
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,200
You've never played this before.

93
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,750
You might break my tablet.

00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,290
This is a pure "humility"!

97
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,580
The word is "humiliation".

98

Sorry about this, Mr. Jia.

100
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,910

00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,160
Of course.

too shy to speak in English.

on video games in no time.

Why not?

You're blocking the rearview mirror.

132
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,040
Why not use the door?

133
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,830

196
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:51,750
Ms. Li,

197
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,540
find a way

198
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,500
to improve his posture, too.

199

Add a dance class or something.

200
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,200
Discuss that with Mr. Ma.

201
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,660
That's not in the training plan.

202
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,000
Oh, Jiye's mom,

203
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,040
just go shopping.

204
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,910
What's the point?

205
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,000
I never get to wear these clothes.

206
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,580
Sometimes I wonder

207
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,830
if Chenggang is trying

208
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,120
to toughen up

209
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,410
our son or me.

What kind of life

211
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,910
am I living every day?

212
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,450
Wang, time to clean up.

213
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,120
Got it!

to Xihong No. 7 Middle School]

00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,540
Jiye!

Good thing Wang spotted you in time.

222
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,700
What were you thinking,

223
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,160
dressed like this

224
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,330
and bringing all these toys?

225
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,450
It's my grandson's birthday,

226
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,700
and I wanted to surprise him.

227
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,410
What's wrong?

228
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:13,500
If he asks,

229
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,910
I'll say I won 500 yuan

230
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,160
on a lottery ticket I found.

231
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,540
Why are you so worried about details?

232
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,040
Mom, Jiye's a smart kid.

233
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,500
Those toys obviously cost thousands.

234
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:23,790
What are we, rich?

235
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,750
And how long since he quit this?

236
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,290
Why tempt him back into it?

237
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,000
You can eat it,

238
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,120
but my grandson can't?

239
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,700
If I don't, it'll melt!

240
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,120
Well, I could've eaten it!

241
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,830
You're arguing with me now?

I'm not craving it anymore!

If that's the case, change your clothes.

When Jiye's home,

247
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,330
we'll celebrate his birthday happily.

00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:51,540
Not changing!

I would love to have you
stay with us and Jiye,

250
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,700
but you two never cooperate.

251
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,790
How should I...?

252
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:10,750

Whose kid is that?

257
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,290
He's so cocky!

00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,790
Dad, that was my classmate.

260

His family's super poor.

00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,290
He has to run to school every day.

262
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,830
Poor kid.

263
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,620
Compared to him, we're really lucky

264
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,250
to have what we do.

Got it?

[A few years ago]

269
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,500
Why are we stopping here?

270
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,580
Where is this place?

271
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,910
Let me show you around.

272
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,660
This is where I grew up.

273
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,330
This place has great feng shui.

274
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,250
Everyone here was poor,

275
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,080
and my family was the poorest.

276
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,290
"Here stands a humble home,

277
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,540
but virtue makes it glow."

278
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,200
Back then, my grandma

279
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,870
was bedridden for years.

280
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,290
I carried her up and down the stairs.

281
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,500
All the household chores, big or small,

282
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,200
were done by me.

283
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,580
I even had to run home
during school breaks

284
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,200
to make my grandma herbal medicine.

285
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,580
With your story,

286
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,660
you could've been one of the country's
"Ten Outstanding Youths".

287
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,080
I used to complain
about how unfair life was,

288
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,370
but looking back, I realize
all my success today

289
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,620
comes from the hardships
I endured as a child.

290
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,500
Darling, you were truly
"an ambitious youth

291
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,620
who rose above hardship".

292
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,040
The reason I've been able
to get back up every time I've fallen

293
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,200
is because I'm more resilient than most.

294
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,750
I know better than anyone
that I should appreciate

295
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,750
everything I have today.

296
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,580
"Through bitter trials,

297
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,750
one becomes a better man."

298
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,200
Growing up in this environment,

299
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,540
it's no wonder you succeeded.

300
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,450
What a visionary!

301
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:46,660
So wise!

302
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,580
I am truly blessed
to have you as my wife.

303
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,200
So I've been thinking,

304
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,370
while Nugget's still young
and doesn't remember much,

305
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,250
we should bring him here

306
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,620
to live humbly.

307
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,290
What was that?

308
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,500
Raise him poor.

309
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,660
Ma Chenggang, are you out of your mind?

310
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,200
I've been praising you,

311
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,580
and you've been setting a trap?

312
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,040
Did I marry you just to suffer?

313
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,410
This isn't fair!

314
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,000

316
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,290
You spent millions
sending him to study in the US.

317
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,000
Nugget is your son too,

318
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,080
and you want him here?

319
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:23,700
No way!

320
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,700

Who wants your legacy?

326
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,830
And that name,

327
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:34,790
really?

328
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:37,750
Jiye,

329
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,080
we're taking you away for a bit.

330
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,750

331
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:42,660
now it's on you.

332
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,790
Have you talked to your parents?

333
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,000
It's handled.

334
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,000
Let's go.

335
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,290
Leave Nugget here!

What are you trying to do?

337
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,500
This is outrageous!

338
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,120
Let my grandson out, now!

339
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,290
Didn't you say you
took care of your parents?

340
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,620
I only gave one pill each,

341
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,620
and didn't dare give more.

342
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:14,700
How considerate.

343
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,450
Now's our chance.

344
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,200
Go!

346
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,250
Stop right there!

347

Honey, hurry and chase them!

No need.

00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,910
Mom and Dad

00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,330
Nope.

I'll borrow this book then.

383

Wang,

384
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,040
why do we use washboards
to wash clothes?

385
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,500
It's a matter of physics.

386
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,830
The ridges on them increase friction

387
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,080
between your hands and the clothes.

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,660
Hello, sir!

Young Master.

392
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,830
Hello, young man.

[Happy Birthday]

394
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,200
Jiye,

395
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,080
who's getting the first slice of cake?

396
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,450
My mom.

397
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,410
My birth was your hardest day.

398
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,450
Good boy.

399
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,330
Happy birthday.

400
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,040
The second slice

401
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,500
is for Grandma.

402
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,290
My other grandma always says

403
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm strong now

404
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,200
because you took care of me
when I was little.

405
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,000
Heard it plenty.

406
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,620
My mom says it every day.

407
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,500
Your grandma took
such great care of you.

408
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,000
She'd even take out

409
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,540
the grape seeds
before feeding you grapes.

410
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,040
Do you remember how chubby you were

411
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,370
when you were little?

412
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:12,120
You'd sit on that swing
with no pants on.

413
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,330
A nanny

414
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,200
would fan you,

415
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,750
while another

416
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,410
fed you snacks.

417
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,450
Nugget, let's go out to sea!

418
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,410
You'd splash around

419
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:30,830
in our big swimming pool.

420
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,910
Grandma, eat cake!

421
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,620
What are you doing?

422
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,410
Here's some good luck!

Don't run!

425
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,540
This is my fault!

426
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,290
I can't protect you from them!

427
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,200
Mom,

428
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,160
what are you doing?

429
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,120
Dad, what's the pool
Grandma was talking about?

430
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,290
A bathhouse.

431
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,910
She played pretend with you
when you were little.

432
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,330
Your dad's loaded!

433
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,330
He's filthy rich!

434
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:04,040
Mom, what are you doing?

435
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,290
Can you stop talking, please?

436
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,040
Send two people.

437
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,620
No need for this.

438
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,620
Let's get some air

439
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,620
and wash your face.

440
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:13,620
They all act poor in front of you!

441
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,000
But behind your back, they live it up!

442
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,370
I can walk by myself!

443
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,450

Jiye,

453
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,910
did you figure out

454
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,620
our monthly spending like I asked

455
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,500
the other day?

456
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,790
On average, we spend
9.5 yuan a day on groceries,

457
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,370
so that's 285 yuan a month.

458
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Gas costs 3.1 yuan per unit.

459
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,450
We use under 3 units a day.

460
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,580
Electricity is 0.55 yuan
per kilowatt-hour.

461
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,450
We use one daily.

462
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,660
Grandma's herbal medicine
costs 15 yuan per dose,

463
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,040
so it's 30 yuan a day

464
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,290
and 900 yuan a month.

465
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,290
In total, we spend 1,291.8 yuan a month.

466
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,660
You forgot the water bill.

Water meter stays down

468
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,250

I'm giving it to you.

you'll be the little manager
of this family.

477
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,000

484
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,080
did you get a new phone?

485
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:05,700
Silly boy,

486
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,790
how could I afford a new phone?

487
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,290
Still the same one.

488
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,120
You must be

489
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,290
tired from reading.

490
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,450
Rest your eyes.

491
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,370

495
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,120
take a quick break,

496
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,290
then get back to it.

Dad,

498
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,450
what's the point of reading?

499
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,540
Reading

500
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,660
can change a person's fate.

501
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,410
But everyone in our family
loves reading.

502
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,660
How come we're still so poor?

503
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,040
That's because

504
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,120
your mom, grandma, and I

505
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,700

506

We haven't read enough.

507

I'm going to bed now.

508
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,700
Isn't it too early?

Morning market tomorrow.

510
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,620
The morning market?

511
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,040
Vegetables are cheaper there.

512
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,200
I'm saving up

513
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,450
to buy Dad new shoes.

514
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,450
These shoes can last me
a few more years.

00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:59,250
why is the neighbor
playing different music today?

517
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,540
This piece

518
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,000
is by a famous pianist

519
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,160
named Sergei Vasilyevich Rachmaninoff.

520
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,000
His music

521
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:10,540
is grand like an epic

522
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,870
and very poetic.

523
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:15,160
It's bold in structure and technique

524
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,620
with a deeply lyrical tone.

525
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,580

With so many experts helping us,

how could we not raise a good kid?

531
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,080
Is this tough environment
really necessary?

532
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,000
Experts can teach knowledge,

533
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,870
but they can't teach resilience.

534
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,290
Madam, we've safely escorted
your parents home.

I've been meaning to ask,

554
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,910
why keep asking me to wash your feet?

555
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,160
Can we switch things up?

is the greatest virtue
of the Chinese people.

558
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,750
We have to lead by example,

559
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:45,080
not just talk about it, right?

560
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,660
Alright.

561
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,620
Can you at least

562
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,500
rinse your feet first?

00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,330
Are you saying...?

564
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:50,330
Alright, enough.

After all these years together,

566
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,500
you two should be closer

Leave now. Don't disturb my business.

Understand?

762
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,620
I'll call the police.

763
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,870
No, don't do that.

Hello, officer.

A kid is blackmailing me.

766

made them so angry?

772
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,910
Jiye, you're back.

Why didn't you buy groceries today?

Oh my.

Grandma, eat more.

It'll fill you up. Eat.

he rushed into the dump

and collected rubbish with a smile.

Monday morning is foggy.

At the policeman's signal,

855
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,430
he rushed into the dump

and collected rubbish with a smile.

Ragpicker Jiye is loggy.

859
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,830
That's outrageous.

860
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,620
How could you let my son
collect rubbish?

861
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:50,750
Aren't you all educators?

862
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,160
Is that how you teach kids?

863
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:53,450
Let me ask you.

864
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,040
You want my son to drop out?

865
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,620
How can he face his classmates?

866
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:59,910
Have you thought about his self-esteem?

867
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:04,450
Cool down.

868
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:07,250
Who cares about this stupid bag?

When one has nothing,

870
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:16,290
his self-esteem is worthless.

00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,080
Jiye is walking the same path

872
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,330
as I did in my childhood.

873
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,830
It's the only way for him
to take over the company.

874
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:29,330
A lot of power brings a lot of desire.

875
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,330
One with too much desire
can't resist temptation.

876
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,450
To play games,

877
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,250
he used all the money

878
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:40,830
for a trick.

879
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,700
I need to teach him a lesson.

880
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:55,330
Suffering now

881
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:58,250
is better than being devastated
in the future.

882
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,580
No matter how great a business is,

883
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:03,000
it won't always be smooth sailing.

884
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,200
Only when he corrects
the mistake himself

885
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:09,200
can he avoid making another mistake.

886
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:11,790
The setbacks Jiye is experiencing

887
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:13,410
will help him

888
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:16,870
bounce back in adversity.

889
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:20,250
Far-sighted.

890
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:22,910
Far-sighted.

Arm or shoulder, which looks better?

893
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,080
Not mad?

894
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:31,040
Why?

895
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:32,200
What's wrong?

896
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:47,750
Sun.

897
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:48,950
Hurry up.

898
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,410
Go buy some cigarettes
from the supermarket.

899

So I closed the casket for you.

906
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:42,290
Thank you, darling.

907
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:44,200
Come back anytime.

908
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:45,790
I'll keep bottles for you.

909

913
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,580
spent all day collecting bottles
without eating.

914

Hello, young man.

00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:47,750
I'm Peter.

920
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,500
Can I become your friend?

921

I'm Ma Jiye. Nice to meet you.

922
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,000
Let's talk about business, Ma Jiye.

923
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,290
I will buy those bottles.

924
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:58,410
Really?

925
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,160
Yes, let's go.

926
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:04,830
That's ridiculous.

He can't practice English
on an empty stomach.

928
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,250
This is hunger mnemonics.

929
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:14,200
Enjoy your meal.

00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:19,040
A foreigner

931
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,120
treats a garbage collector to a meal.

932
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,660
What a big plot hole!

933
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,700
Mr. Ma just relented.

934
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:27,370
He ignored logic.

935
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:31,500
Watch them.

936
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:42,120
OK.

937
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:49,450
How about I'm gonna
take you to meet a friend?

938
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:11,290
Come in.

939
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:22,910
Inside.

940
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:27,870
I brought him.

941
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:31,450
Hello, madam.

942
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,120
Where is the madam?

943
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:37,120
Hello, sir.

944
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:38,580
Just Dajun.

945
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:39,660
Hello, Dajun.

946
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:49,080
How much do you sell for these bottles?

947
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:51,120
Ten cents per plastic bottle.

948
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,580
Fifteen cents per can.

949
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:53,700
Thirty cents per glass bottle.

950
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:55,160
Alright.

951
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,330
Bring all your bottles

952
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:58,910
here from now on.

953
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:03,040
I'll buy them for a high price.

954
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:04,870
Really?

955
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:10,040
It's our little secret.

956
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,410
I just have one request.

957
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:13,200
What's it?

958
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,370
I am

959
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:16,120
a clean freak.

960
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,620
I don't do business with dirty kids.

961
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:20,290
So

962
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,370
quickly go take a bath.

963
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:29,290
Ms. Li, you're lucky today.

964
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:30,250
Indeed.

965
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:32,580
Yang.

966
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:33,450
Take my place.

967
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:34,870
I have to prepare food.

968
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:35,500
Today,

969
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:37,290
I'll make a good meal for Young Master.

970
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,080
Chop sea cucumbers small,

971
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,160
no whole ones.

972
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,200
Jiye has been taking them for mushrooms.

973
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:43,870
Got it.

974
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:46,660
Hasn't Young Master eaten yet?

975
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:48,660
Where?

976
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,370
Xihong Hotel.

977
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:52,250
Hotel?

978
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:53,080
With who?

979
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:54,700
The foreign teacher.

980
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,500
Who sent the teacher?

981
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:00,250
We didn't set up English lessons today.

982
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:04,220
Oh no.

983
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:08,870
Excuse me,

984
00:53:08,910 --> 00:53:10,000
a kid this tall

985
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,450
was just taken away by a foreigner.

986
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:12,580
Which room?

987
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:17,080
Where's he?

988
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,200
Room 1809.

989
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,200
Who are you?

990
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:20,500
First-class chef.

991
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:21,620
Just talk to me.

992
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:22,790
We're here for my kid.

993
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:23,700
Call your manager over.

994
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,040
Who are you?

995
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:51,250
Where's my son?

996
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:52,580
Your son?

997
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:54,580
Where is his son?

998
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:56,290
Where is his son?

999
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:57,830
Don't move.

1000
00:53:57,870 --> 00:53:59,000
Or I'll beat you.

1001
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:09,950
You scumbag.

1002
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:13,330
Son.

1003
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:14,000
Dad.

1004
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:14,580
Son.

1005
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:16,250
Dad.

1006
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:19,250
Dad.

1007
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:20,000
I'm here.

1008
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,120
Dad.

1009
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,700
It's no use begging for mercy.

1010
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:33,910
Dad.

1011
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:36,620
Quick.

1012
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,330
Knock it off.

1013
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:44,250
Breaking in.

1014
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,410
Assaulting.

1015
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,250
Provoking.

1016
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:49,620
Damaging Sino-foreign relations.

1017
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,120
You committed multiple crimes.

1018
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,160
Give me 10 million.

1019
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,330
Do you want me to freeze
your credit card now?

1020
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,250
Forget it.

1021
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:01,790
Dajun.

1022
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:05,000
Did you just talk nonsense
to your brother?

1023
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:07,370
What could I say to him?

1024
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,000
I'm at your mercy.

1025
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,290
How dare I tell him anything?

1026
00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:12,620
Then why bring him here?

1027
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,580
No reason.

1028
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:15,580
I'm his elder brother.

1029
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:17,950
What's wrong with me
taking a bath with him?

1030
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,290
Look what you did.

1031
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:22,330
Chunlan.

1032
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:24,200
Assess the damage.

1033
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:28,370
Chenggang.

1034
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,120
Apologize now.

1035
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:32,830
Sorry.

1036
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:34,450
It's okay.

1037
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:35,250
Dad.

1038
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,370
Peter and you...

1039
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:52,000
Chunlan.

1040
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:53,410
Peter is my good friend.

1041
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:55,660
I met him in America.

1042
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,250
He took my surname.

1043
00:55:58,290 --> 00:55:59,870
His Chinese name is Ma Bide.

1044
00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:01,830
He likes Chinese culture very much.

1045
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:04,910
Ma Bide.

1046
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:07,870
If he knew something
about Chinese culture,

1047
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:09,200
he wouldn't use this name.

1048
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,410
Alright. That's it for today.

1049
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:14,160
Follow the rules.

1050
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,250
Don't call me Dad outside,

1051
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:16,450
or I'll freeze your card.

1052
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:20,750
I'm at your command.

1053
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:22,830
Chenggang.

1054
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:29,580
Luckily, Chenggang rushed over in time.

1055
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:33,370
Or Jiye would have been abducted.

1056
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:34,580
Jiye.

1057
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,250
Your dad trusted you.

1058
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:38,040
He let you keep all the money.

1059
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,080
But what did you do?

1060
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,250
You bought this stupid stuff.

1061
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:42,580
Look at you.

1062
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:44,080
How can you be so willful?

1063
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,870
You let your dad down.

1064
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:47,200
Stop it.

1065
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:49,870
I've forgiven Jiye.

1066
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:56,540
Sorry, Dad.

1067
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:57,950
It's okay.

1068
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,330
Kids are fond of play.

1069
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:02,870
Don't make a fuss over it.

1070
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:07,410
But son, remember,

1071
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:10,000
never repeat

1072
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,250
your mistakes.

1073
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:17,290
Just let it go.

1074
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,410
Now, we should think of a way

1075
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:21,660
to help Jiye

1076
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,200
earn back the money.

1077
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:25,580
I can continue to collect bottles.

1078
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:27,660
Okay.

1079
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:29,500
Good idea.

1080
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:31,750
But think smart,

1081
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:35,000
not hard.

1082
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,870
Where can you get most bottles?

1083
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:38,750
Trash cans.

1084
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:44,870
Normally,

1085
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:46,580
your rivals think the same way.

1086
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:48,870
To solve the problem,

1087
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:51,160
you have to grasp the essence.

1088
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:53,080
What are bottles

1089
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,540
before they become garbage?

1090
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:56,370
Plastic.

1091
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:59,160
Its scientific name is
polyethylene terephthalate.

1092
00:57:59,200 --> 00:57:59,870
No.

1093
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:01,750
They're water containers.

1094
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,580
They're essentially containers.

1095
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,500
On average, people drink water

1096
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:07,750
every 90 minutes.

1097
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,500
So where there are the most people,

1098
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:11,290
there are the most bottles.

1099
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:12,120
Shopping malls,

1100
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:12,950
pedestrian zone,

1101
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:13,750
and stadiums.

1102
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:15,000
Stadiums.

1103
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:17,580
Stadiums are huge containers.

1104
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:18,870
Collecting bottles is easy.

1105
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:20,330
But people will bring

1106
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:23,080
the bottles with water inside away.

1107
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:26,000
So you have to bet.

1108
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:27,330
Bet on what?

1109
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:29,290
Bet on a wonderful game

1110
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:31,290
that can keep the bottles
in the stadium.

1111
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,350
[Royal Roc VS Invincible Cockroach
The second half 0:7]

1112
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,330
We're making a fortune.

1113
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:49,950
Come on, kid.

1114
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,250
Who are those guys?

1115
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:21,330
They've booked the whole place.

1116
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:27,250
Without connections,

1117
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,200
one can't even grab some bottles.

1118
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:13,290
The shoes he bought are really nice.

1119
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:14,910
Fleece shoes

1120
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,250
of the right size.

1121
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:17,500
After all, he is my son.

1122
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:20,250
Jiye is a filial and thoughtful boy.

1123
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:22,790
Jiye must become a talent

1124
01:01:22,830 --> 01:01:24,370
and have a great future.

1125
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:26,250
Mr. Ma.

1126
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:28,250
I have to chill your enthusiasm.

1127
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:29,000
Please forgive me.

1128
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:30,450
Jiye must be much more successful

1129
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,200
than you in the future.

1130
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:36,950
Jiye is back!

1131
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:45,620
Dad!

1132
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,450
Big event. Look who is here.

1133
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:50,830
His family is indeed not well off.

1134
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:52,830
Mr. Yu, please.

1135
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:55,000
This way, please.

1136
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:01,410
I've been reflecting on myself

1137
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:03,330
since I came back.

1138
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:05,750
It's better to teach a man to fish

1139
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:07,330
than to give him fish.

1140
01:02:08,410 --> 01:02:09,540
This is Mr. Yu,

1141
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:10,580
the best long-distance race coach

1142
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:12,200
in Xihong City.

1143
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:15,370
He coached several national champions.

1144
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:16,000
See?

1145
01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:18,200
Is that good news?

1146
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:24,830
I'm very strict with their training.

1147
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,120
Before I came here,

1148
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,750
I worried

1149
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:28,950
if he could endure the hardship
in the sports school.

1150
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,040
But as I see you and your house,

1151
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:34,620
I am completely relieved.

1152
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:36,870
Mr. Yu.

1153
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:39,830
The condition of our family

1154
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:41,370
is a little special.

1155
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:42,450
I can see that.

1156
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:44,450
I have real power in school.

1157
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:46,750
I can give him a poverty allowance.

1158
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:48,750
He is really a running kid.

1159
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:49,790
I must coach him to win an award

1160
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:51,750
in the National Games, at least.

1161
01:02:52,330 --> 01:02:52,950
Do you have confidence?

1162
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:53,910
Yes, I do.

1163
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:55,200
Then show me.

1164
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:56,450
Move!

1165
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:57,200
Show me now.

1166
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:58,120
Lift your legs.

1167
01:02:58,620 --> 01:02:59,120
Swing your arms.

1168
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:00,290
Make big moves.

1169
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:01,540
Come on!

1170
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:03,660
Mr. Yu,

1171
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,000
my son will never...

1172
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:11,290
Pearls are everywhere

1173
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:12,790
but not the same as the eyes.

1174
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,250
It's your blessing

1175
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:16,870
to be appreciated by Mr. Yu.

1176
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:20,450
I've decided.

1177
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:22,290
He will go.

1178
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,120
I'm going to win glory for my country.

How could you be so cruel

1182
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:47,250
to lie to him?

Really send him to the sports school?

I don't care.

I'll tell him the truth tomorrow.

We are wealthy.

Doctor,

1233
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:10,080
can I go to the sports school?

1234
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:11,950
Wait a moment.

1235
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,450
I'll have a further exam.

1236
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:26,750
Where are his parents?

1237
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,290
Do you think
my father should also be here?

1238
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:30,450
Of course not.

1239
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:33,580
He has a very rare disease

1240
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:34,950
that prevents him

1241
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,500
from being a professional athlete.

1242
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:39,040
However, it won't affect his daily life.

1243
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:40,620
It's still okay

1244
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:41,290
to participate in the school games.

1245
01:06:41,950 --> 01:06:43,750
But remember not to be an athlete.

1246
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:56,200

1251
01:07:06,410 --> 01:07:07,410
Not to mention

1252
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:09,080
a little boy.

1253
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,330
Mom, I'm fine.

1254
01:07:41,370 --> 01:07:42,450
Don't cry.

1255
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:43,830
The doctor said

1256
01:07:43,870 --> 01:07:44,750
it won't affect my life.

1257
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:46,200
Though I can't go to the sports school,

1258
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:47,790
I can pick up bottles for money.

1259
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:49,830
When I grow up,
I can still work to earn money.

1260
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:52,290

1261
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:54,660
I'm sorry to make you suffer.

1262

1263
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:59,000
I'll have a conversation

1264

with my little man.

1265
01:08:08,830 --> 01:08:09,580
Jiye.

1266
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:13,200
You're always thinking about working.

1267
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:14,080
Have you thought

1268
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:15,660
about letting others work for you?

1269
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,330
Qingbei University

1270
01:08:20,790 --> 01:08:22,410
is the best university in our country.

1271
01:08:22,450 --> 01:08:24,250
And the Department
of Business Administration there

1272
01:08:25,330 --> 01:08:27,950
is the cradle of top entrepreneurs.

1273
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:30,040
As long as you can
get into that university,

1274
01:08:31,450 --> 01:08:33,500
your destiny can be changed.

1275
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:37,620
Does Qingbei University
provide free food and accommodation?

1276
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:40,160
Don't worry.

1277
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,540
As long as you are admitted,

1278
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:43,500
I will get you the education fee
by hook or crook.

1279
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:48,750
Actually, going to Qingbei University
was also my dream.

1280
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:50,750
But at that time,

1281
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:52,620
I was too poor to go to university,

1282
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:54,120
so it's my regret.

1283
01:08:54,950 --> 01:08:56,370
Do you have confidence

1284
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,080
to fulfill this dream for me?

1285
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:01,290
Yes.

1286
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,410
In this case,

1287
01:09:04,950 --> 01:09:07,290
I must buy you a bicycle.

1288
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:09,120
You have difficulty with your legs,

1289
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:10,200
so you don't need to run to school.

1290
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:12,250
You can ride in the future.

1291
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:13,120
Really?

1292
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:13,750
Certainly.

1293
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:15,950

1294
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:17,540

1295
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:19,120

1437
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:33,760

to human consciousness.

1456
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:14,050

1470
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:37,350
It can also be

1473
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:40,850

the Anunnaki,

01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:43,640
or the Protection God.

1477
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:44,390
It's all possible.

1478
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,510

They are watching me.

1480
01:17:47,890 --> 01:17:49,550
Once I disobey their will,

1481
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:50,970
they will manipulate my destiny.

1482
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:52,720

1483
01:17:54,050 --> 01:17:55,260
No, we can't.

1486

1490
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:15,850

1495
01:18:25,890 --> 01:18:27,260

Sir, I just think

there must be a mysterious force

1503
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:39,760
that controls me

1504
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,430
and consciously makes me like this.

1505
01:18:41,470 --> 01:18:42,600
I can feel it.

1506
01:18:42,850 --> 01:18:44,350

You are the mysterious force

1508
01:18:45,850 --> 01:18:47,850
that prevents me
from becoming the deputy director.

1509
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:48,930
Ma Jiye,

1510
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:50,300
you don't have to attend the class
in the afternoon.

1511
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:52,390
You get out of here now.

1512
01:18:52,430 --> 01:18:54,220
Write the key points about materialism

1513
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:55,180
ten times.

1514
01:18:55,970 --> 01:18:57,640
You are even boasting about yourself.

1515
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,260
[Xihong Seventh Middle School]

1516
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:04,180
The material determines consciousness.

1517
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:05,470
Existence determines thinking.

1518
01:19:07,930 --> 01:19:09,760
I earn twenty bucks again.

1519
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:11,850
The world is a material world.

1520
01:19:11,890 --> 01:19:13,100
We believe in atheism.

1521
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:13,930
We are against theism.

1522
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:15,430
We adhere to dialectical materialism.

1523
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:16,930
The material determines consciousness.

1524
01:19:17,550 --> 01:19:18,720
Existence determines thinking.

1525
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:21,850
The world is a material world.

1526
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:01,970
Grandma!

1527
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:07,140
Grandma!

1528
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:14,300
Grandma!

1529
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:18,220
Grandma, your shoe!

1530
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:23,550
Grandma!

1531
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:27,640
Grandma!

1532
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:34,720
Grandma!

1533
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:36,850
Your shoe!

1534
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:43,680
Jiye, why are you in such a hurry?

1535
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:49,010
Jiye,

1536
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:50,550
I've got A Brief History of Time
for you.

1537
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,550
I have no time now.

1538
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:53,550
And the Interpretation of Dreams?

1539
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,260
Mr. Zhou,

1540
01:20:55,010 --> 01:20:56,260
did you see my grandma running upstairs?

1541
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:57,010
I promise

1542
01:20:57,050 --> 01:20:58,180
your grandma has been lying in bed.

1543
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:04,640
Something wrong with my words.

1544
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:10,550
Jiye, you're back.

1545
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:16,260
Grandma,

1546
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,050
you were playing basketball.

1547
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:20,720
You must be mistaken.

1548
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:24,640
How can a lame old lady play basketball?

1549
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:26,600
You ran so fast that you lost your shoe.

1550
01:21:27,470 --> 01:21:29,050
It's not mine.

1551
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:34,760
Mom.

1552
01:21:36,890 --> 01:21:37,430
Mom!

1553
01:21:39,550 --> 01:21:40,550
What did Ms. Li do?

1554
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:41,550
She is so careless.

1555
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:42,680
The older she gets,
the more careless she is.

1556
01:21:44,430 --> 01:21:45,970
Grandma, you were playing basketball.

1557
01:21:46,010 --> 01:21:46,890
I chased you all the way.

1558
01:21:46,930 --> 01:21:48,140
Why don't you admit it?

1559
01:21:50,430 --> 01:21:50,930
Mom,

1560
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:54,300
you've been reading the newspaper.

1561
01:21:54,930 --> 01:21:55,760
You should take a break.

1562
01:21:58,100 --> 01:21:58,550
Jiye,

1563
01:21:59,180 --> 01:21:59,890
you are back.

1564
01:22:00,550 --> 01:22:01,890
Mom, where do you come from?

1565
01:22:04,390 --> 01:22:05,350
Of course the bedroom.

1566
01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:07,600
I searched the room just now

1567
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:08,890
but there was no one.

1568
01:22:10,350 --> 01:22:11,050
What are you saying, Jiye?

1569
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:11,760
I've been

1570
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,430
lying in bed all the time.

1571
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,930
Sometimes I lie under the covers.

1572
01:22:17,390 --> 01:22:19,140
Sometimes I go under the bed.

1573
01:22:23,890 --> 01:22:26,510
Jiye must be too stressed lately.

1574
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:27,180
I think so.

1575
01:22:31,470 --> 01:22:33,260
Did I fall into the parallel universe?

1576
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:34,760
What are you saying?

1577
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,470
You read too many books.

1578
01:22:36,510 --> 01:22:38,220
You're even hallucinating.

1579
01:22:42,350 --> 01:22:43,550
Just throw the shoe away.

1580
01:22:43,970 --> 01:22:45,430
A single shoe is worthless.

1581
01:22:50,430 --> 01:22:51,350
What's going on?

1582
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:54,760
How can you be so careless?

1583
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:55,180
Dad.

1584
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:56,760
Please come here.

1585
01:22:57,350 --> 01:22:58,100
Please.

1586
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:02,760
What are you doing here?

1587
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:04,260
Dad, I have to tell you something.

1588
01:23:04,890 --> 01:23:06,550
I saw my grandma playing basketball.

1589
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:09,970
Jiye,

1590
01:23:11,550 --> 01:23:13,220
you must have been under great pressure.

1591
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:14,260
Dad, I swear I saw her.

1592
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:16,260
Please trust me.

1593
01:23:16,510 --> 01:23:17,260
I chased her all the way.

1594
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:18,430
She even lost one of her shoes.

1595
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:19,970
I think my mom and my grandma

1596
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:21,100
are trying to hide something from me.

1597
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:23,100
When I asked them today,

1598
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:24,720
my mom has been touching her hair.

1599
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:25,930
In psychology,

1600
01:23:25,970 --> 01:23:28,260
it is the typical manifestation
of nervousness and lying.

1601
01:23:45,470 --> 01:23:46,430
Jiye has grown older.

1602
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:50,010
He no longer believes
in our explanation.

1603
01:23:51,550 --> 01:23:52,890
The college entrance examination
is coming up.

1604
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:54,850
He can't be distracted.

1605
01:23:56,510 --> 01:23:57,220
Ms. Li,

1606
01:23:58,600 --> 01:23:59,510
I'm so sorry.

1607
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:31,800
Jiye.

1608
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:33,720
What's the matter, grandma?

1609
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:42,840
I'll be honest with you.

1610
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:56,010
In fact,

1611
01:25:01,390 --> 01:25:03,720
I know slam dunk.

1612
01:25:45,770 --> 01:25:47,970
[R.I.P.]

1613
01:25:47,970 --> 01:25:48,760
You finally wake up.

1614
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:53,390
Jiye.

1615
01:25:54,930 --> 01:25:57,510
Your grandmother left us forever

1616
01:25:57,550 --> 01:25:59,220
last night.

1617
01:26:01,090 --> 01:26:03,470
You said you saw her
playing basketball yesterday.

1618
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:06,340
In biology,

1619
01:26:06,390 --> 01:26:07,550
it's called
momentary recovery before death.

1620
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:10,510
It's a biological reaction

1621
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:13,470
that the brain
restores the body's functions

1622
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:16,260
to normal briefly before death.

1623
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:19,720
Grandma has long been terminally ill.

1624
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:22,800
We didn't tell you

1625
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,140
because we were afraid
you would be distracted.

1626
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:31,220
Get dressed.

1627
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:34,260
Let's say farewell to her.

1628
01:26:40,430 --> 01:26:41,090
Put it in the middle.

1629
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:42,340
A little more central.

1630
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:43,140
That's right.

1631
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:44,470
Move away that one.

1632
01:26:44,890 --> 01:26:46,010
That's right.

1633
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:48,590
Director,

1634
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:51,010
there is no name on the wreath.

1635
01:26:51,050 --> 01:26:52,390
It doesn't look real.

1636
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:54,550
It's borrowed from others.

1637
01:26:54,590 --> 01:26:56,090
I have to return it to them later.

1638
01:26:56,470 --> 01:26:58,300
It's all my fault.

1639
01:26:58,340 --> 01:26:59,090
It's my carelessness

1640
01:26:59,140 --> 01:27:01,220
that makes these troubles.

1641
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:02,340
It doesn't matter, Ms. Li.

1642
01:27:02,390 --> 01:27:03,300
I'm here, Director.

1643
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:05,220
It's really a rush order.

1644
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:05,970
Please help me.

1645
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:10,050
Jiye is here.

1646
01:27:11,050 --> 01:27:11,760
Ms. Li,

1647
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:12,470
lie down

1648
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:13,510
and don't move.

1649
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:14,010
Remember?

1650
01:27:14,050 --> 01:27:14,680
Don't worry.

1651
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:16,260
I'll definitely
complete the last mission.

1652
01:27:55,260 --> 01:27:56,220
Grandma!

1653
01:27:57,550 --> 01:27:58,430
- Grandma!
- Please take care.

1654
01:28:00,340 --> 01:28:01,140
Jiye,

1655
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:04,140
Grandma won't be reassured
to see you like this.

1656
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:09,800
The eldest grandson kowtows.

1657
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:11,760
Kowtow to your grandma.

1658
01:28:12,590 --> 01:28:14,470
Kowtow once.

1659
01:28:16,430 --> 01:28:18,140
Kowtow twice.

1660
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:21,390
Husband and wife bow to each other.

1661
01:28:26,550 --> 01:28:29,640
Husband and wife bow to the dead.

1662
01:28:31,890 --> 01:28:32,590
Grandma,

1663
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:36,550
I haven't bought you the big house.

1664
01:28:38,590 --> 01:28:40,390
I haven't taken you to travel around.

1665
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:43,760
Grandma.

1666
01:28:51,090 --> 01:28:51,930
Mom!

1667
01:28:52,340 --> 01:28:53,930
Jiye, kowtow to your grandma again.

1668
01:28:53,970 --> 01:28:54,510
Quick.

1669
01:28:57,340 --> 01:28:59,720
Your grandson is here.

1670
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,220
One more.

1671
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:08,220
You can rest in peace now.

1672
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:22,010
Ms. Li wrote a message

1673
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:25,220
to her dear grandson, Ma Jiye,
during her last days.

1674
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:28,430
Dear grandson,

1675
01:29:28,890 --> 01:29:30,720
I'm always proud of you.

1676
01:29:31,430 --> 01:29:32,590
Now I'm gone.

1677
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:35,260
You should listen
to your dad and mom carefully.

1678
01:29:36,010 --> 01:29:36,930
It's a pity

1679
01:29:36,970 --> 01:29:38,590
that I don't see the day

1680
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:41,760
when you receive the offer
from Qingbei University.

1681
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:43,220
Never mind.

1682
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:44,300
I'll fly

1683
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:46,720
over the Department
of Business Administration

1684
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:48,930
of Qingbei University SEM

1685
01:29:49,430 --> 01:29:50,640
to see you there.

1686
01:29:51,430 --> 01:29:52,800
It's a date.

1687
01:29:56,010 --> 01:29:58,300
Ms. Li is an excellent intellectual.

1688
01:29:58,340 --> 01:29:59,680
She has been frugal all her life.

1689
01:30:06,050 --> 01:30:09,800
Please say your final goodbyes.

1690
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:10,930
Grandma.

1691
01:30:19,220 --> 01:30:20,390
Grandma!

1692
01:30:23,270 --> 01:30:24,640
Grandma!

1693
01:30:31,470 --> 01:30:33,340
Jiye!

1694
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:38,340
I heard my grandma's voice.

1695
01:30:40,590 --> 01:30:41,720
Mom!

1696
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:43,890
I'll say my last farewell to you.

1697
01:30:46,590 --> 01:30:48,390
How can a corpse come to life?

1698
01:30:49,930 --> 01:30:51,340
Where are you, Grandma?

1699
01:30:51,470 --> 01:30:55,890
[Crematory House]

1700
01:31:04,970 --> 01:31:06,760
The wind is clear.

1701
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:09,260
The crane is heading north.

1702
01:31:09,550 --> 01:31:11,300
The ancestors blessed

1703
01:31:11,890 --> 01:31:13,470
your academic success.

1704
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:16,890
It's really too much this time.

1705
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:18,010
He almost found out the truth.

1706
01:31:18,050 --> 01:31:19,260
It's the only way out.

1707
01:31:27,180 --> 01:31:28,890
Am I not going to see Jiye again

1708
01:31:29,590 --> 01:31:31,970
from now on?

1709
01:31:32,010 --> 01:31:32,840
No.

1710
01:31:33,470 --> 01:31:35,050
You're just stepping back
for the moment.

1711
01:31:35,390 --> 01:31:37,340
As soon as Jiye graduates
from Qingbei University,

1712
01:31:37,890 --> 01:31:39,300
I'll let you meet each other again.

1713
01:31:39,970 --> 01:31:41,930
You are always the grandmother of Jiye.

1714
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:44,260
By the way,

1715
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:47,140
he is so lucky to be able
to experience the resurrection

1716
01:31:47,180 --> 01:31:48,470
of his loved ones once in his life.

1717
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:50,510
You are right.

1718
01:31:52,510 --> 01:31:53,220
Grab a bite.

1719
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:54,220
No, thanks.

1720
01:31:54,590 --> 01:31:55,140
All right.

1721
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:57,220
Then I'll bury you now.

1722
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:01,140
Thank you
for providing this precious place.

1723
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:02,390
I'm so sorry to bother you.

1724
01:32:02,430 --> 01:32:03,590
Mr. Ma is so kind to say so.

1725
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:04,930
This is your home.

1726
01:32:04,970 --> 01:32:06,390
Even the stoves are donated by you.

1727
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:07,090
Okay, bye.

1728
01:32:07,970 --> 01:32:08,970
Welcome home, Mr. Ma.

1729
01:32:23,050 --> 01:32:24,300
Why are you crying?

1730
01:32:26,050 --> 01:32:28,840
I don't think he will be so sad

1731
01:32:28,890 --> 01:32:30,550
if I die.

1732
01:32:30,590 --> 01:32:31,470
He will.

1733
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:32,590
You'll see that day.

1734
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:38,390
What are you doing?

1735
01:33:39,010 --> 01:33:39,760
Ma Jiye,

1736
01:33:40,090 --> 01:33:41,090
I present you a dance.

1737
01:33:41,470 --> 01:33:43,220
I know you would laugh when I dance.

1738
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:44,890
Happy now?

1739
01:33:47,970 --> 01:33:49,300
The day before my grandma died.

1740
01:33:49,340 --> 01:33:50,470
I saw her playing basketball.

1741
01:33:52,390 --> 01:33:53,640
My dad said
it was momentary recovery before death.

1742
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:57,140
But I looked up all information.

1743
01:33:57,390 --> 01:33:58,550
It is impossible.

1744
01:33:58,590 --> 01:34:00,050
That wouldn't make someone
who has been bedridden

1745
01:34:00,090 --> 01:34:01,260
suddenly stand up and play basketball.

1746
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:02,470
My gosh.

1747
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:05,470
What a hapless death!

1748
01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:06,260
What do you think?

1749
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:07,220
If your grandma was alive,

1750
01:34:07,220 --> 01:34:08,890
surely she will be interviewed on TV.

1751
01:34:08,930 --> 01:34:10,840
She may endorse a health product!

1752
01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:12,090
Don't underestimate it.

1753
01:34:12,140 --> 01:34:13,140
That's lots of money.

1754
01:34:13,930 --> 01:34:14,930
Stop thinking.

1755
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:16,640
It's not your life.

1756
01:34:16,930 --> 01:34:18,590
It's not about money.

1757
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:19,300
I mean

1758
01:34:19,340 --> 01:34:20,930
that day she played basketball
was weird.

1759
01:34:21,430 --> 01:34:22,340
I went home for my mother.

1760
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:23,590
She was not there.

1761
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:24,390
But in the blink of an eye,

1762
01:34:24,430 --> 01:34:25,340
she suddenly appeared

1763
01:34:25,390 --> 01:34:26,930
with a bunch of jewelry.

1764
01:34:26,970 --> 01:34:28,140
The clothes were not even her own.

1765
01:34:31,510 --> 01:34:32,970
I see.

1766
01:34:33,550 --> 01:34:35,430
I know why she was hiding from you.

1767
01:34:36,550 --> 01:34:39,220
I'm afraid she's not the only one
in that room.

1768
01:34:40,470 --> 01:34:40,930
What?

1769
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:41,840
Your dad

1770
01:34:43,470 --> 01:34:44,510
might be cuckolded.

1771
01:34:44,970 --> 01:34:46,010
Right back at you!

1772
01:34:46,050 --> 01:34:48,010
Your dad is old and poor.

1773
01:34:48,050 --> 01:34:49,470
But your mom is young and beautiful.

1774
01:34:50,050 --> 01:34:52,800
How can she afford jewelry?

1775
01:34:53,770 --> 01:34:54,690
In the room

1776
01:34:55,020 --> 01:34:56,640
probably hid a very rich man.

1777
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,390
Your grandma met them, right?

1778
01:35:02,770 --> 01:35:03,640
What do you mean?

1779
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:05,350
Maybe your grandmother
[*Wu Dalang was poisoned by his wife]

1780
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:09,600
died like Wu Dalang.

1781
01:35:14,270 --> 01:35:15,440
Fish is ready!

1782
01:35:18,270 --> 01:35:18,980
Come on, Jiye.

1783
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:20,150
Eat it while it's hot.

1784
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:21,600
It's good for your intelligence.

1785
01:35:21,650 --> 01:35:22,020
Come on.

1786
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:35,100
What are you looking at?

1787
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:36,230
Just eat.

1788
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:46,440
Dad, go dye your hair.

1789
01:35:48,810 --> 01:35:50,560
For whom? My age doesn't allow.

1790
01:36:06,900 --> 01:36:07,270
Hello?

1791
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:08,150
What's up?

1792
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:09,560
I'm looking for Ma Jiye.

1793
01:36:10,730 --> 01:36:12,730
But why are you calling me?

1794
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:14,270
Who's to blame
if the teacher took the phone?

1795
01:36:14,770 --> 01:36:15,350
I'll count to three. One.

1796
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:16,650
Two.

1797
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:18,520
Ma Jiye, it's for you.

1798
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:21,230
Hello?

1799
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:23,020
Ma Jiye.

1800
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:24,810
I was right.

1801
01:36:25,270 --> 01:36:28,060
Your mom went to a villa
with a handsome man with long hair.

1802
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:29,060
No.8 Haibin Road.

1803
01:36:29,100 --> 01:36:29,980
Hurry up and come.

1804
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:34,900
Jia Qiqiang,

1805
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:36,440
give me his phone!

1806
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:57,230
Chenggang,

1807
01:36:57,810 --> 01:36:58,810
you see, Dajun

1808
01:36:59,350 --> 01:37:01,150
has changed a lot.

1809
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:02,350
He's way more steady.

1810
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:03,440
It's time

1811
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:05,230
for him to work out in our company.

1812
01:37:05,230 --> 01:37:06,310
Work out?

1813
01:37:06,770 --> 01:37:07,900
A gym fits him.

1814
01:37:08,810 --> 01:37:10,560
Ma Dajun, I told you.

1815
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:12,100
I don't care what you want to do.

1816
01:37:12,180 --> 01:37:13,760
But I won't let you start up a business.

1817
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:16,260
Save for havocking our family business.

1818
01:37:17,130 --> 01:37:17,840
Dad,

1819
01:37:18,180 --> 01:37:19,760
I know you've been looking down upon me.

1820
01:37:20,470 --> 01:37:21,510
Look at the calligraphy.

1821
01:37:22,510 --> 01:37:23,260
The eldest son

1822
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:24,090
walks sadness.

1823
01:37:24,090 --> 01:37:25,510
[An idle youth, a needy age]

1824
01:37:25,510 --> 01:37:27,470
Why do I have to walk sadness?

1825
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:29,970
Why not my younger brother?

1826
01:37:32,970 --> 01:37:34,180
Tell me I'm brilliant.

1827
01:37:34,220 --> 01:37:35,840
You're just being biased.

1828
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:38,010
You've put all your efforts
on my brother.

1829
01:37:38,050 --> 01:37:39,800
You don't even see how good I am.

1830
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,760
I do.

1831
01:37:41,180 --> 01:37:42,260
You scored 98 points on the test.

1832
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:43,090
That's really good.

1833
01:37:43,130 --> 01:37:44,130
Two points away from a perfect score.

1834
01:37:44,180 --> 01:37:45,180
It's the college entrance examination.

1835
01:37:46,010 --> 01:37:46,970
Total score.

1836
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:49,930
Bad luck then.

1837
01:37:50,260 --> 01:37:52,430
Had he chosen "C" for all the questions,
it would've been over 100 points.

1838
01:37:52,470 --> 01:37:53,260
Auntie,

1839
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:54,880
had I chosen the same answer

1840
01:37:54,930 --> 01:37:56,840
in that year,

1841
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:59,510
I would've got a zero.

1842
01:38:04,510 --> 01:38:04,970
Ma Jiye.

1843
01:38:06,430 --> 01:38:07,050
Right over there.

1844
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:07,880
The big house on the inside.

1845
01:38:08,470 --> 01:38:08,970
Alright.

1846
01:38:09,010 --> 01:38:09,380
Let's go.

1847
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:10,090
Feifei,

1848
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:11,130
I'll go by myself.

1849
01:38:11,180 --> 01:38:12,260
It's a family shame.

1850
01:38:15,510 --> 01:38:16,090
Jiye went to the villa,

1851
01:38:16,130 --> 01:38:17,340
isn't it?

1852
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:29,470
Mom!

1853
01:38:30,180 --> 01:38:31,430
I know you are inside!

1854
01:38:33,590 --> 01:38:34,050
Chunlan!

1855
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:37,880
Jiye,

1856
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:39,470
what brings you here?

1857
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:46,260
My classmate saw you coming here
with a man.

1858
01:38:47,430 --> 01:38:48,340
What are you talking about?

1859
01:38:48,630 --> 01:38:49,760
Your dad is here.

1860
01:38:51,510 --> 01:38:51,970
Look.

1861
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:55,510
Chenggang.

1862
01:38:57,050 --> 01:38:57,630
Jiye?

1863
01:38:58,430 --> 01:39:00,180
What brings you to mom and dad's office?

1864
01:39:05,220 --> 01:39:05,590
Hurry.

1865
01:39:06,180 --> 01:39:07,510
Say hello to Mr. and Mrs.

1866
01:39:10,180 --> 01:39:10,590
Come on.

1867
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:16,310
Hello, Mr. and Mrs.

1868
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:19,480
Hello.

1869
01:39:20,270 --> 01:39:20,980
My apology.

1870
01:39:22,230 --> 01:39:23,230
The bigger the family,

1871
01:39:23,270 --> 01:39:24,440
the more polite you have to be.

1872
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:26,940
Your mom and I work here lately.

1873
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:30,230
We are better off now.

1874
01:39:30,230 --> 01:39:31,350
It's all because of them.

1875
01:39:31,770 --> 01:39:32,310
He's right.

1876
01:39:32,730 --> 01:39:33,690
