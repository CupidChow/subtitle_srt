1
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,508
My parents are really not there,

2
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:03,567
only Marie is there.

3
00:01:03,716 --> 00:01:05,551
You go first.

4
00:01:09,053 --> 00:01:10,082
Okay, let's go.

5
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:22,524
Marie?

6
00:01:23,021 --> 00:01:24,064
Yes, sir.

7
00:01:30,261 --> 00:01:31,388
Hello, Marie.

8
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,051
Sir, should I prepare your snacks?

9
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:35,009
- No, we already ate.
- Alright.

10
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:37,610
Marie, we'll just make our assignment.

11
00:02:00,561 --> 00:02:03,605
Wait, Marie might come in.

12
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:06,367
No she won't,
she's busy downstairs.

13
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,439
You’re not just playing me, are you?

14
00:02:17,094 --> 00:02:18,151
Of course not.

15
00:02:19,016 --> 00:02:20,329
You’re the only one I want.

16
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,512
Promise?

17
00:02:24,635 --> 00:02:25,712
Promise.

18
00:02:26,462 --> 00:02:27,485
Is this your first time?

19
00:02:28,454 --> 00:02:29,466
Yes.

20
00:02:32,988 --> 00:02:36,116
I'll take care of you,
I won't make you cry.

21
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,333
Okay?

22
00:08:45,749 --> 00:08:47,835
I thought you're already done?

23
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:33,991
Don't leave me okay?

24
00:09:36,104 --> 00:09:37,314
Promise.

25
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:40,055
Forever?

26
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:44,311
Forever.

27
00:09:54,746 --> 00:09:58,333
I’ve been noticing—
you’ve been smiling a lot lately.

28
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,268
Like you're on cloud nine.

29
00:10:04,169 --> 00:10:08,770
So this is how it feels
when you know someone loves you.

30
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:11,832
Is that because of Arnie?

31
00:10:12,374 --> 00:10:13,418
Why?

32
00:10:13,736 --> 00:10:15,613
Have you given him
your mother pearl?

33
00:10:18,745 --> 00:10:25,961
I thought, only after we get married
are we supposed to give the pearl?

34
00:10:26,477 --> 00:10:27,559
Oh no.

35
00:10:28,445 --> 00:10:33,490
I know but when the moment came,

36
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,890
even though I didn’t want to,

37
00:10:35,383 --> 00:10:42,053
when he finally
kissed me, that was it.

38
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:43,835
You’re so easy!

39
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,453
Are you sure about him?

40
00:10:49,847 --> 00:10:52,308
We already promised forever.

41
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,353
This feels so good.

42
00:10:56,969 --> 00:10:58,053
Is that Arnie?

43
00:10:58,855 --> 00:11:00,523
- Where?
- There!

44
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:04,582
In the car.

45
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:11,715
Hey, you're zoning out.

46
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,076
Are you alright?

47
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:36,542
Geez, you drained all my energy.

48
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:38,991
But I enjoyed it a lot,
it felt so good.

49
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,424
You told me yesterday...

50
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:46,033
the reason you didn’t pick me up
was because you weren’t around,

51
00:14:46,057 --> 00:14:48,880
then I'll see you with another girl?

52
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:53,211
It's not like that,
that's Ritz, my cousin.

53
00:14:53,774 --> 00:14:57,528
she wanted me to bring her to work,
since I'm kind, I did.

54
00:14:58,532 --> 00:14:59,585
Are you sure?

55
00:14:59,874 --> 00:15:00,917
Come on!

56
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:10,991
There’s only one woman in my life,

57
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,697
the woman I love more than anything.

58
00:15:15,188 --> 00:15:16,481
And who would that be?

59
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,608
Who else,

60
00:15:19,506 --> 00:15:21,825
of course it's you, Cheska.

61
00:15:24,606 --> 00:15:25,713
Smooth talker.

62
00:15:27,314 --> 00:15:31,234
You scared me for a second,
I thought you were leaving me.

63
00:15:32,521 --> 00:15:33,939
Come here.

64
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:37,516
How can I leave you?

65
00:15:38,526 --> 00:15:39,652
You're so beautiful.

66
00:20:24,736 --> 00:20:32,736
Arnie, Ritz called—she said
she’s picking you up later.

67
00:20:33,785 --> 00:20:36,538
Yeah, she messaged me.
I haven’t replied yet though.

68
00:20:36,825 --> 00:20:40,507
It’s Uncle Yoyong’s birthday,
he invited me.

69
00:20:41,252 --> 00:20:42,629
You’re going out later?

70
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:45,621
Yeah, I have to. He might
get upset if I don’t show up.

71
00:20:45,826 --> 00:20:47,520
Who's Uncle Yoyong?

72
00:20:47,575 --> 00:20:50,751
Marie, he's mama's cousin, remember?

73
00:20:50,776 --> 00:20:51,997
Ahh, yes, I remember.

74
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,167
Anyway love,

75
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,515
I won't be able to bring you home,
I got tired because of you.

76
00:20:59,896 --> 00:21:02,023
Okay, I'll take a nap,
and go in a while.

77
00:21:03,334 --> 00:21:07,964
It's okay, I'll just grab a tricycle,
you go take a nap,

78
00:21:07,991 --> 00:21:10,076
so you can rest, since
you're leaving later.

79
00:21:10,101 --> 00:21:11,112
Alright.

80
00:21:12,332 --> 00:21:13,708
- Bye.
- Bye.

81
00:21:13,835 --> 00:21:15,212
- Bye, Marie.
- Take care.

82
00:21:33,881 --> 00:21:36,884
Arnie told me,
Ritz is his cousin,

83
00:21:37,257 --> 00:21:39,551
the girl he's with
in the car last time,

84
00:21:40,315 --> 00:21:43,526
- she asked him to bring her to work.
- Miss, can I have a brush?

85
00:21:44,016 --> 00:21:45,226
Thank you.

86
00:21:47,493 --> 00:21:48,869
You believed him?

87
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:49,990
Geez...

88
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:55,185
Of course, it seems believable.

89
00:21:56,207 --> 00:21:58,835
Ritz, even invited him
to his uncle's birthday.

90
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:02,150
You know Ritz?

91
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:08,832
No, but that's what
his helper said.

92
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:14,751
It seems like you and
Arnie are always together.

93
00:22:16,174 --> 00:22:17,509
Are you always at his house?

94
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:23,110
Yesterday, I was there, because
he wasn't replying to my messages.

95
00:22:23,974 --> 00:22:25,642
So I thought, he might be asleep,

96
00:22:26,341 --> 00:22:28,760
that's why I went there,
and he's actually in his room.

97
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,709
Maybe you're always having sex?

98
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,964
Admit it!

99
00:22:36,496 --> 00:22:39,332
It's different Kath,
is it really like this?

100
00:22:40,582 --> 00:22:43,668
We do it several times
every time I'm in his house.

101
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,309
It seems like he's never out of energy.

102
00:22:48,841 --> 00:22:53,770
Oh no, you need to be careful,
you might get pregnant accidentally.

103
00:22:53,815 --> 00:22:55,025
Oh no, Cheska!

104
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,960
I don’t think so,
we do take precautions.

105
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,693
And we've already
promised each other

106
00:23:02,258 --> 00:23:03,715
that we'll be together forever.

107
00:23:04,604 --> 00:23:06,564
He said he really loves me.

108
00:23:06,744 --> 00:23:10,567
And that he'll never choose
any other girl over me.

109
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:21,113
Why is that we
have so much to do?

110
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:25,325
I still need to pass the
drawing to Sir Palisok.

111
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,394
Otherwise, we have another long night.

112
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,170
I still need to pass two paintings—

113
00:23:33,695 --> 00:23:35,488
See, I told you,

114
00:23:36,028 --> 00:23:39,740
come to think of it,
it's better you know now,

115
00:23:39,874 --> 00:23:42,406
and you discovered Arnie's real character.

116
00:23:43,301 --> 00:23:46,763
In all honesty, a lot of
people find him boastful,

117
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:50,007
and Arnie's a cheater.

118
00:24:11,694 --> 00:24:13,613
The day will come Arnie,

119
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:16,457
I'll get back at you.

120
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,174
I promise you this.

121
00:24:35,065 --> 00:24:36,391
Madam, what is it?

122
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,737
Uh... Um...

123
00:24:38,762 --> 00:24:41,218
Have you ordered the fabrics for the gown?

124
00:24:41,844 --> 00:24:46,319
Yes, it's set to arrive this week,
then I'll start sewing the gowns.

125
00:24:46,392 --> 00:24:48,320
Okay, Xander?

126
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:49,879
Yes, Madam?

127
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:53,199
Have you talked to the venue supplier?
Have you paid the down payment?

128
00:24:53,224 --> 00:24:55,143
Of course, madam.

129
00:24:55,665 --> 00:24:56,705
Very good.

130
00:24:57,257 --> 00:24:58,926
This is the only thing I can't decide.

131
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:02,665
Ms. Cheska, should I run
the long trail to the border?

132
00:25:02,887 --> 00:25:05,932
Ms. Helen's budget might
not be able to cover it.

133
00:25:06,053 --> 00:25:08,168
Don't worry about
the budget, Bernie.

134
00:25:08,428 --> 00:25:10,388
Do everything that
will make it beautiful.

135
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:13,333
Okay, I love it.

136
00:25:24,876 --> 00:25:25,892
Hello?

137
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:28,648
Hi, I'm Celine Gutierrez,

138
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,237
I want to hire you
as my wedding planner.

139
00:25:31,334 --> 00:25:33,905
Yes, this is Cheska Flores,
wedding planner.

140
00:25:34,191 --> 00:25:35,275
Are you available?

141
00:25:35,753 --> 00:25:37,588
Our wedding will be held next year,

142
00:25:37,926 --> 00:25:40,932
on June 2026.

143
00:25:42,016 --> 00:25:43,143
Okay, wait hold on.

144
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,669
As I see it, we can
still accommodate it,

145
00:25:47,014 --> 00:25:50,002
as long as we're given six months
to prepare, we can do it.

146
00:25:50,193 --> 00:25:51,238
Perfect!

147
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:53,552
Can we meet so I can discuss

148
00:25:53,577 --> 00:25:55,729
my wedding preferences
and my planned concept?

149
00:25:55,976 --> 00:26:00,188
Yes, it'll be better if we meet in person,
maybe we can meet here in my office?

150
00:26:00,688 --> 00:26:02,627
You pick the time
you're available this week.

151
00:26:03,826 --> 00:26:05,119
Okay,

152
00:26:06,405 --> 00:26:09,575
I'll be there on Friday afternoon.

153
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:11,379
Okay perfect, see you.

154
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,697
Thanks, I'm excited to meet you.

155
00:26:14,047 --> 00:26:15,457
Thank you, bye.

156
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,549
Yes.

157
00:26:23,173 --> 00:26:25,550
Where are we in
picking the color palette?

158
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,449
There you go.

159
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,192
- Hey, good evening,
- Good evening, sir.

160
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,595
- Are you going home?
- Yes, Sir.

161
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,789
- Good evening Sir Rowell,
- Where is—

162
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:43,852
Ma'am Cheska, Sir Rowell is here.

163
00:26:44,953 --> 00:26:47,967
Madam, you have a visitor,
Sir Rowell is here!

164
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:50,166
- Bye Sir Rowell!
- Bye.

165
00:26:51,682 --> 00:26:53,319
Okay, I'll join them.

166
00:26:53,344 --> 00:26:54,364
Alright.

167
00:26:54,389 --> 00:26:55,756
- Take care.
- Oh, sir, you're here!

168
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,240
- Hello.
- Wait for me.

169
00:26:57,265 --> 00:26:58,287
For you.

170
00:26:58,508 --> 00:27:00,385
Thanks, you always give me flowers.

171
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,870
Of course, anything for you.

172
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:04,349
Wow.

173
00:27:09,801 --> 00:27:11,303
Have you eaten?

174
00:27:12,065 --> 00:27:14,234
Come on, let's eat, my treat.

175
00:27:15,197 --> 00:27:18,075
It's always your treat,
you might think I'm cheap.

176
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:24,499
Remember I told you, as long
as it's for you, I'll do anything.

177
00:27:29,571 --> 00:27:33,602
But we ate snacks late,
so I'm still full.

178
00:27:37,521 --> 00:27:39,440
You're always busy.

179
00:27:45,311 --> 00:27:46,330
[sighs]

180
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:53,173
I'm done now.

181
00:27:54,384 --> 00:27:59,110
I already told you, you can't be attached,
you might fall for me.

182
00:27:59,814 --> 00:28:00,846
We just need to be chill.

183
00:28:01,545 --> 00:28:04,445
If we're meant to be,
then we're meant to be.

184
00:28:04,926 --> 00:28:06,951
Let's just enjoy each other's company,

185
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,014
even though we're busy
with our own careers.

186
00:28:16,727 --> 00:28:18,896
Ches, people might see us.

187
00:28:18,921 --> 00:28:20,214
No one's here.

188
00:28:29,556 --> 00:28:30,598
Ches—

189
00:28:32,561 --> 00:28:34,077
does it mean
we're officially together?

190
00:28:34,101 --> 00:28:36,019
No, it's not that.

191
00:28:42,284 --> 00:28:44,244
So, why are you being like this?

192
00:28:45,405 --> 00:28:48,032
What do you mean?
Don't you like it?

193
00:28:52,806 --> 00:28:53,851
Ches, no.

194
00:28:56,676 --> 00:28:58,678
Our situation is okay,

195
00:28:59,176 --> 00:29:00,713
just remember no commitment.

196
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:02,740
So there's no expectations.

197
00:29:07,943 --> 00:29:11,947
Remember I promised myself,

198
00:29:12,214 --> 00:29:14,432
that I'll only give everything,

199
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:17,468
to the woman I love, after the wedding.

200
00:29:19,136 --> 00:29:23,432
And since we're not there yet,
we can't do this?

201
00:29:23,833 --> 00:29:24,908
Like that?

202
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:28,375
I know it's hard, but we need
to restrain ourselves.

203
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,893
Do you really love me?

204
00:29:31,497 --> 00:29:32,524
Of course,

205
00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:38,085
even though we're not officially together,
and you're treating me this way,

206
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,611
I still love you.

207
00:29:41,107 --> 00:29:43,907
I'll just fix up, wait for me.

208
00:29:44,543 --> 00:29:45,739
Alright.

209
00:29:58,468 --> 00:30:02,473
Dom and I are opposites,
we're so different from each other,

210
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,846
I'm loud, he's reserved,

211
00:30:07,095 --> 00:30:14,291
I share a lot, he's private,
I'm artsy while he's sporty.

212
00:30:15,533 --> 00:30:19,484
That's why I'm surprised that
when it comes to sex,

213
00:30:19,797 --> 00:30:21,077
we are the same.

214
00:30:23,132 --> 00:30:29,444
We both enjoy, long, happy, active sex.

215
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:33,041
Where only taking pee is the break.

216
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:38,489
Oh I'm sorry,
am I sharing too much?

217
00:30:38,682 --> 00:30:40,923
No, it's okay, we're the same.

218
00:30:41,267 --> 00:30:44,342
I also get frustrated
when my sex life's boring.

219
00:30:45,536 --> 00:30:48,414
Anyway, where's the groom,
why is he not with you?

220
00:30:48,948 --> 00:30:52,564
Ah, he's working in Dubai,
in an engineering company.

221
00:30:53,134 --> 00:30:55,970
Actually, we've been apart
for a year now.

222
00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:59,457
[sighs] No sex life.

223
00:31:00,662 --> 00:31:01,747
Very dry.

224
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,477
That's why when he comes home,

225
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:10,584
we're gonna marry each other
and enjoy lots of adventure, you know.

226
00:31:10,609 --> 00:31:12,897
I'm intrigued about your groom.

227
00:31:13,377 --> 00:31:19,041
As in Cheska, he's so much,
he won't stop until he gets tired.

228
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,881
It reminds me of someone...

229
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,451
Who?

230
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,494
From my past, back in
the province, my ex.

231
00:31:30,734 --> 00:31:35,683
Anyway, let's go
back to your motif.

232
00:31:36,536 --> 00:31:40,290
Actually, we've talked about it,
but for me personally,

233
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,925
I'd love a touch of gold.

234
00:31:42,992 --> 00:31:49,670
Ah we have options here,
there's old rose, and some olives,

235
00:31:49,695 --> 00:31:53,115
it'll match the motif that you like,

236
00:31:53,428 --> 00:31:56,931
so you can choose from here,
but if you'd like another...

237
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,249
we can order it.

238
00:31:59,527 --> 00:32:00,645
Sounds good.

239
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:14,849
I really, really,
really miss you, love.

240
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:18,313
Of course I miss you too, look,
I bought you a lot of stuff.

241
00:32:18,657 --> 00:32:24,400
Of course the most special is a secret.

242
00:32:24,892 --> 00:32:30,977
Don't be like that,
give it to me now.

243
00:32:31,745 --> 00:32:34,623
I'm still tired love,
I had a long trip.

244
00:32:35,737 --> 00:32:37,013
Is that so?

245
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,206
My trip was so long.

246
00:32:39,002 --> 00:32:40,629
Long?

247
00:32:41,527 --> 00:32:44,741
It's been to long since
we've seen each other.

248
00:32:45,439 --> 00:32:46,857
Too long?

249
00:32:48,761 --> 00:32:49,806
It's hard,

250
00:32:50,278 --> 00:32:53,531
my boss is so hard-headed,
he even wants to delay my going home.

251
00:32:54,282 --> 00:32:55,725
Hard?

252
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:03,852
And it's full of my
overflowing love.

253
00:33:04,228 --> 00:33:06,134
Ahh...

254
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,506
Oh, full, and overflowing?

255
00:33:10,834 --> 00:33:14,838
Then let me help you.

256
00:37:31,198 --> 00:37:33,617
Ms. Ches, Ms. Celine is here.

257
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:36,153
Okay, thank you.

258
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:39,011
Hi Ches!

259
00:37:39,892 --> 00:37:42,957
Hi Celine, good to see you,
how are you?

260
00:37:43,044 --> 00:37:44,679
I'm good, thank you,

261
00:37:45,092 --> 00:37:50,222
I want you to meet my
soon to be husband, Dom.

262
00:37:59,513 --> 00:38:01,306
Glad to meet you, Ms. Ches.

263
00:38:04,975 --> 00:38:08,061
At last, we've finally met, Sir Dom.

264
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,839
Um, I believe you and Sir Dom
have already talked

265
00:38:17,864 --> 00:38:20,781
about the things we've discussed
during our meeting, Celine?

266
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,592
Yes, we've discussed it,
and it's okay with him.

267
00:38:23,931 --> 00:38:26,880
Just call me Arnie, no sir,
it's too formal.

268
00:38:28,167 --> 00:38:31,634
Okay, here's the contract,
for your perusal,

269
00:38:31,659 --> 00:38:33,577
if ever you want to
clarify something,

270
00:38:33,747 --> 00:38:38,381
if none, we can proceed
with the contract signing.

271
00:38:39,174 --> 00:38:40,526
Have you read this, love?

272
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:45,698
Yes love, all the conditions
we want are in this.

273
00:38:46,382 --> 00:38:49,051
In professional services
of House of Cheska,

274
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:51,370
do you have questions
or clarifications?

275
00:38:52,251 --> 00:38:54,420
If this is okay with my love,

276
00:38:56,313 --> 00:38:57,626
I have no other questions.

277
00:38:57,851 --> 00:39:02,684
It's okay, my love
is so sweet right?

278
00:39:04,466 --> 00:39:07,469
Okay then, let's continue finalizing
the wedding concept.

279
00:39:07,494 --> 00:39:10,318
Before we forget, love,
where's the cheque?

280
00:39:27,778 --> 00:39:28,779
Thank you.

281
00:39:28,891 --> 00:39:29,964
Um...

282
00:39:30,191 --> 00:39:36,652
To proceed, here are the colors
based on your preferences.

283
00:39:36,677 --> 00:39:44,677
We have here, Ivory, Dusty Rose,
Gold, here's what it looks like.

284
00:39:45,336 --> 00:39:47,616
That's perfect!

285
00:39:47,791 --> 00:39:48,834
Very nice.

286
00:39:54,299 --> 00:39:56,093
You know what, I searched about you,

287
00:39:57,003 --> 00:39:58,880
I found out you're
now a famous planner.

288
00:39:59,623 --> 00:40:01,417
Well, even when we were in college,

289
00:40:02,202 --> 00:40:05,622
you're one of the top students
for fine arts in our province.

290
00:40:06,025 --> 00:40:09,026
That's why it's not surprising
Celine chose you to be our wedding planner.

291
00:40:10,788 --> 00:40:13,877
But I want to know,

292
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:18,503
have you ever thought of the moments
when we were together?

293
00:40:19,438 --> 00:40:22,060
No, not really,

294
00:40:23,382 --> 00:40:25,308
I've forgotten about that.

295
00:40:26,253 --> 00:40:29,798
I've buried all those memories, until now.

296
00:40:30,714 --> 00:40:33,717
You know what, you're
more beautiful now,

297
00:40:34,324 --> 00:40:37,327
more sexy, more alluring.

298
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:40,245
I don't know why,
but I felt attracted to you earlier.

299
00:40:41,468 --> 00:40:46,920
Well, I can't blame you,
many other guys told me that.

300
00:40:47,376 --> 00:40:49,013
Thanks for the compliment.

301
00:40:51,443 --> 00:40:57,096
You know what, I've been thinking,
what if we meet each other,

302
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:59,733
you know just like the old days.

303
00:41:01,034 --> 00:41:02,640
That doesn’t come to my mind.

304
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:06,386
Don’t dare say no to me.
I'm not used to it.

305
00:41:07,775 --> 00:41:09,882
Come on, even just once,
just one more time,

306
00:41:10,547 --> 00:41:12,695
let's go back to the way we were.

307
00:41:15,386 --> 00:41:18,681
Don’t you miss my kisses,
my repeated caress.

308
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,896
that doesn’t seem to end.

309
00:43:14,591 --> 00:43:15,602
Okay.

310
00:43:16,778 --> 00:43:20,616
But everything will remain
between you and me,

311
00:43:22,432 --> 00:43:24,142
for one last time.

312
00:43:32,052 --> 00:43:33,098
Here.

313
00:43:33,881 --> 00:43:35,632
Wow, you even bothered with this.

314
00:43:37,876 --> 00:43:41,218
It's a good thing you
agreed to my invitation.

315
00:43:43,248 --> 00:43:47,661
I'm not one to take to heart bad things
done to me by other people.

316
00:43:48,194 --> 00:43:52,044
It's all done, I've already move on, Dong.

317
00:43:54,818 --> 00:43:57,727
But did you get mad at me before?

318
00:43:58,534 --> 00:44:02,247
What do you think? What type of girl
would not be mad at a cheater like you?

319
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:05,810
I'm just a bit playful.

320
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:11,590
I'm just really generous, you know
when someone asks, I can't say no.

321
00:44:11,635 --> 00:44:12,795
Especially if I like her too.

322
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:17,696
What about me? I'm your type,
but you never loved me?

323
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:20,430
We were so young then,
we needed to play around.

324
00:44:20,489 --> 00:44:23,733
Oh please. Until now,
you're playing around.

325
00:44:24,705 --> 00:44:26,165
Not that much,

326
00:44:26,753 --> 00:44:28,087
just a little.

327
00:44:29,425 --> 00:44:30,432
Well...

328
00:44:39,005 --> 00:44:40,298
You—

329
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:45,390
You missed it, right?
That's why you agreed.

330
00:44:47,369 --> 00:44:48,745
I won't lie,

331
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:52,284
so yes.

332
00:44:53,461 --> 00:44:55,088
I knew it,

333
00:44:56,353 --> 00:44:58,039
I'm not easy to forget.

334
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:07,994
But what about your boyfriend?

335
00:45:08,312 --> 00:45:10,057
Can't he satisfy you?

336
00:45:11,027 --> 00:45:12,320
I don't have a boyfriend.

337
00:45:14,446 --> 00:45:16,115
Ever since we broke up?

338
00:45:17,295 --> 00:45:18,566
No, I had some boyfriends,

339
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:21,710
but when I get bored,
I break up with them.

340
00:45:24,198 --> 00:45:25,722
You're a heart breaker, huh?

341
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,182
Wow.

342
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:30,170
How about you? Pussy wrecker?

343
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:06,912
So, Ms. Helen will be available
on Wednesday or Friday.

344
00:49:06,937 --> 00:49:08,022
Okay.

345
00:49:08,275 --> 00:49:09,943
This one, is this okay with you?

346
00:49:10,479 --> 00:49:11,522
Is this approved?

347
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:24,601
Why won't you answer?
Are you busy?

348
00:49:27,185 --> 00:49:31,180
How about this one, it seems like
this is the best among the options.

349
00:49:31,205 --> 00:49:32,274
Let's meet up please.
I can't forget about you.

350
00:49:32,298 --> 00:49:34,509
Let's ask for Ms. Cheska's approval.

351
00:49:34,534 --> 00:49:36,774
That was the last time,
it won't happen again. I'm busy.

352
00:49:38,787 --> 00:49:42,371
That was the last time,
it won't happen again. I'm busy.

353
00:49:46,452 --> 00:49:47,803
How about among these three?

354
00:49:48,397 --> 00:49:49,837
What do you think?

355
00:49:56,402 --> 00:49:57,820
Why are you ignoring me?

356
00:49:58,832 --> 00:50:00,709
No girl has refused me before.

357
00:50:06,606 --> 00:50:07,606
What do you think?

358
00:50:07,857 --> 00:50:10,590
All those flowers will
come directly from Baguio.

359
00:50:11,356 --> 00:50:12,884
From our suppliers there.

360
00:50:13,187 --> 00:50:14,813
I love it!

361
00:50:15,405 --> 00:50:18,228
We were right in picking you, Cheska.

362
00:50:19,234 --> 00:50:20,486
What do you think, love?

363
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:25,145
I like it better than before.

364
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,197
Yeah.

365
00:50:28,222 --> 00:50:30,769
Instead of the first design
you've shown us,

366
00:50:30,874 --> 00:50:33,241
this is one of a kind.

367
00:50:33,669 --> 00:50:36,755
Thank you so much,
I'm glad you like it.

368
00:50:37,222 --> 00:50:39,370
Every design we make here

369
00:50:39,496 --> 00:50:42,038
is something we don't
replicate with our other clients,

370
00:50:42,162 --> 00:50:44,117
unless they specifically request it,

371
00:50:44,364 --> 00:50:48,503
but in your case,
this will never be replicated.

372
00:50:50,078 --> 00:50:51,537
This is uniquely yours.

373
00:50:57,406 --> 00:50:59,556
- Ma'am Cheska!
- Yes?

374
00:50:59,784 --> 00:51:02,656
There's something
for Ms. Celine Salazar,

375
00:51:02,707 --> 00:51:04,283
someone just delivered it here.

376
00:51:04,314 --> 00:51:06,239
- Thank you.
- Okay, bye.

377
00:51:06,725 --> 00:51:08,435
Celine Salazar, this really is for you.

378
00:51:09,087 --> 00:51:12,186
What's this, who sent this?

379
00:51:16,118 --> 00:51:17,853
How did they know I'm here?

380
00:51:21,667 --> 00:51:22,959
What does this contain?

381
00:51:23,857 --> 00:51:26,063
Here, use my laptop.

382
00:52:21,979 --> 00:52:23,423
Love, what's this?

383
00:52:25,852 --> 00:52:27,479
I thought I'm the only one?

384
00:52:28,697 --> 00:52:30,866
I thought you've already changed?

385
00:52:39,473 --> 00:52:41,267
That's not me,
it's just a manipulated clip.

386
00:52:42,674 --> 00:52:44,161
Manipulated?

387
00:52:45,934 --> 00:52:47,811
How can it be manipulated?

388
00:52:48,927 --> 00:52:51,049
After all these years,

389
00:52:52,188 --> 00:52:57,443
I have trusted you, you told me,

390
00:52:58,303 --> 00:53:00,156
you said, you've changed,

391
00:53:02,203 --> 00:53:05,414
and you promised that
I'm the only one in your life.

392
00:53:06,924 --> 00:53:09,666
That's why I agreed to marry you.

393
00:53:10,722 --> 00:53:11,722
But this?

394
00:53:13,447 --> 00:53:15,824
How can I explain this to my parents,

395
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:20,372
to my family,
and to myself?

396
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,436
Damn it, love!

397
00:53:30,975 --> 00:53:32,477
Forget about the wedding.

398
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:36,349
- Love?
- The wedding is off.

399
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:41,813
Celine, calm down. Calm down.

400
00:53:43,646 --> 00:53:46,107
Don't decide anything yet,
talk about it first.

401
00:53:46,396 --> 00:53:48,321
What do we need to talk about?

402
00:53:49,237 --> 00:53:50,863
Here is the clear proof.

403
00:53:51,449 --> 00:53:54,739
Even now that
we're getting married,

404
00:53:55,006 --> 00:53:56,686
he's still a cheater!

405
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,114
- You're disgusting!
- Love...

406
00:53:59,789 --> 00:54:02,227
Let's go home first
and talk about it.

407
00:54:02,252 --> 00:54:04,738
- Come on, let's talk about this.
- No!

408
00:54:07,607 --> 00:54:09,405
Let's end it here.

409
00:54:12,455 --> 00:54:13,915
Leave now.

410
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:17,003
Leave me alone.

411
00:54:23,112 --> 00:54:24,197
Get lost,

412
00:54:24,763 --> 00:54:26,682
get out of my life.

413
00:54:28,207 --> 00:54:30,765
Celine, calm down.

414
00:54:31,564 --> 00:54:34,984
The things you've been through
and your plans will all be a waste.

415
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:37,524
If you want,

416
00:54:38,255 --> 00:54:41,133
just so you can be sure,
he will never cheat on you again,

417
00:54:41,753 --> 00:54:43,296
ask him to sign an agreement that,

418
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:45,782
you'll be the
only girl in his life,

419
00:54:46,601 --> 00:54:49,459
and if he violates that agreement,

420
00:54:50,076 --> 00:54:51,077
sue him.

421
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:36,624
How can you do this to me, Cheska?

422
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:38,877
Answer your own question,

423
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:41,296
how can you do this to Celine?

424
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:44,475
I thought you're all settled,
that's why you're about to get married?

425
00:55:45,531 --> 00:55:46,949
You still haven't changed,

426
00:55:47,655 --> 00:55:49,848
from the time you cheated on me.

427
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:57,812
I thought we're okay?

428
00:55:58,656 --> 00:56:02,859
From the moment I broke up with you,
I promised myself,

429
00:56:02,884 --> 00:56:06,429
that one day, I'll get back at you.

430
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,031
Hold on.

431
00:56:35,699 --> 00:56:37,451
And that day came.

432
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:41,370
The people here
and Dubai know you,

433
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:46,104
all of them said one thing about you.

434
00:56:47,263 --> 00:56:50,141
Arnie has so many
flings here. Gosh!

435
00:56:50,166 --> 00:56:54,416
One classmate of ours from college—
they met several times at the condo.

436
00:56:54,774 --> 00:56:57,109
Every time they meet,
something always happens.

437
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:58,915
Arnie's such a play boy.

438
00:56:59,285 --> 00:57:02,005
But I’m pretty sure he’s in a relationship
with someone in Singapore.

439
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:03,962
She's also working here.

440
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:06,589
I met that person too, and then—

441
00:57:07,093 --> 00:57:10,472
Wait, let me find their pictures—
I have them, I’ll send them to you.

442
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:13,346
Okay, thank you for the information.

443
00:57:27,871 --> 00:57:30,957
That until now,
you're still a cheater.

444
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:33,475
Don't you get tired, Arnie?

445
00:58:22,153 --> 00:58:24,029
Who allowed you to get in?

446
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:26,055
Why are you here?

447
00:58:27,979 --> 00:58:30,524
I just asked your
helper to let me in.

448
00:58:31,142 --> 00:58:32,973
Celine please, let's talk.

449
00:58:33,161 --> 00:58:34,579
Let's fix this, Celine.

450
00:58:37,145 --> 00:58:38,480
Talk?

451
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:40,349
Why do we need to talk?

452
00:58:40,422 --> 00:58:43,708
The moment you
had sex with another,

453
00:58:43,922 --> 00:58:46,091
you ended our relationship.

454
00:58:46,599 --> 00:58:50,154
Celine, I'm so sorry,
I made a mistake,

455
00:58:50,909 --> 00:58:52,244
I won't do it again, I promise.

456
00:58:54,891 --> 00:58:56,768
I can't live without you.

457
00:58:58,317 --> 00:58:59,389
Celine please,

458
00:58:59,535 --> 00:59:01,537
I'm so sorry, please forgive me.

459
00:59:02,256 --> 00:59:04,675
I love you so much, Celine.

460
00:59:06,472 --> 00:59:09,126
Please, I'm sorry, I love you so much.

461
00:59:09,668 --> 00:59:11,861
Please, I'm so sorry.

462
00:59:12,688 --> 00:59:15,608
Please forgive me, please.

463
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:56,421
Go on, continue it, it's so good,

464
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:58,004
I'm so close, go on.

465
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:01,000
Is it different?

466
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:05,221
Yeah, sure, just continue.
I'm so close.

467
01:02:06,876 --> 01:02:08,808
Hey, what's going on? Why?

468
01:02:08,833 --> 01:02:10,668
I've already decided,

469
01:02:11,097 --> 01:02:12,932
the wedding is off.

470
01:02:13,903 --> 01:02:14,903
Ouch!

471
01:02:15,978 --> 01:02:17,609
It hurts, right?

472
01:02:17,702 --> 01:02:21,750
You son of a bitch!
Damn cheater! Get out!

473
01:02:23,381 --> 01:02:24,549
Get out.

474
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,492
Hey, I thought we're okay?

475
01:02:28,724 --> 01:02:30,227
- What's going on?
- Get out of my life,

476
01:02:30,251 --> 01:02:32,165
this blanket is mine.

477
01:02:33,135 --> 01:02:34,636
Get out now.

478
01:02:47,469 --> 01:02:49,220
I hate you,

479
01:02:50,702 --> 01:02:52,454
I hate you,

480
01:02:53,192 --> 01:02:55,480
I'm so stupid.

481
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:59,817
I'm so stupid,

482
01:03:02,048 --> 01:03:06,093
I hate you. I hate you.

483
01:03:18,825 --> 01:03:20,952
So, your decision is really final?

484
01:03:21,915 --> 01:03:24,751
I've thought about it
for a couple of days and nights,

485
01:03:25,239 --> 01:03:27,783
I've come to my senses,
I can't do this anymore.

486
01:03:29,521 --> 01:03:32,524
So next time when
you're ready to commit again,

487
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,115
don't fall for a narcissist.

488
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:38,105
Because he'll love no one but himself.

489
01:03:38,614 --> 01:03:41,116
We really can join the show business.

490
01:03:45,013 --> 01:03:46,807
Best actress!

491
01:03:47,559 --> 01:03:49,311
You too!

492
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:52,995
Congratulations to us.

493
01:03:55,656 --> 01:03:57,783
How's your jealous boyfriend?

494
01:03:57,843 --> 01:04:02,506
I admitted everything to him,
and he cannot accept it.

495
01:04:02,979 --> 01:04:04,898
He can't understand that
it's just work.

496
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:07,051
So I broke up with him.

497
01:04:07,508 --> 01:04:10,634
What? He thinks I'm
going to fall for his drama?

498
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:11,973
No way.

499
01:04:11,998 --> 01:04:13,496
Not me.

500
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:17,667
Don't worry, you have
a lot of love offers,

501
01:04:17,692 --> 01:04:19,438
it doesn’t run out.

502
01:04:20,055 --> 01:04:22,934
I might not accept
any love over yet,

503
01:04:23,918 --> 01:04:25,314
I'll focus on self love first.

504
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:28,856
That's right, because
love and relationship

505
01:04:29,417 --> 01:04:30,743
are not something you look for,

506
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:33,896
it will appear on its own
when you're ready.

507
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:41,942
Let's talk please.
Give me another chance.

508
01:04:44,115 --> 01:04:46,993
Damn you, it's just an act.

509
01:04:48,379 --> 01:04:49,594
I'm just curious,

510
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,638
did you really not fall for him,
even just for a little?

511
01:04:53,662 --> 01:04:54,667
Hmm...

512
01:04:54,992 --> 01:04:57,369
There are times
when I thought about it,

513
01:04:57,636 --> 01:05:01,398
but in those moments,
I told myself

514
01:05:01,645 --> 01:05:04,725
I can't mix
my work and love life,

515
01:05:06,084 --> 01:05:08,957
anyways, he's not even my type.

516
01:05:09,162 --> 01:05:11,189
I like foreigners.

517
01:05:11,445 --> 01:05:13,197
But in terms of sex,
you had fun?

518
01:05:13,822 --> 01:05:19,202
Yeah, always,
but I don't want boastful guys,

519
01:05:19,436 --> 01:05:21,571
those who really think
they're hot shit.

520
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:25,963
How about you?
How are you and Rowell?

521
01:05:27,526 --> 01:05:32,823
But I pity him, because honestly,
I've fallen for him.

522
01:05:33,208 --> 01:05:36,169
But he's boring in bed.

523
01:05:37,949 --> 01:05:42,677
But I'm not closing any doors,
because I can teach him.

524
01:05:42,868 --> 01:05:43,921
True.

525
01:05:53,642 --> 01:05:57,400
- Come.
- Wow.

526
01:05:57,496 --> 01:05:59,665
Here, I've added a bonus there.

527
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:01,437
Thank you so much.

528
01:06:01,464 --> 01:06:03,174
Thank you, too.

529
01:06:03,524 --> 01:06:05,138
So what's the plan?

530
01:06:05,849 --> 01:06:09,066
Maybe I'll take a
vacation in Singapore first.

531
01:06:09,225 --> 01:06:11,604
Since you've bothered me
for two years.

532
01:06:12,847 --> 01:06:15,683
Who knows, you might
find your forever there.

533
01:06:16,206 --> 01:06:17,332
I hope so.

534
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:20,710
We will see each other right?

535
01:06:21,278 --> 01:06:25,380
On my future wedding,
you'll be my wedding planner, okay?

536
01:06:25,405 --> 01:06:28,134
Of course, free of charge.

537
01:06:28,168 --> 01:06:29,795
Wow.

538
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:33,314
Okay then, I'll go ahead.

539
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,201
Bye.

540
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:07,377
Thank you.

541
01:07:08,713 --> 01:07:11,349
Tell me honestly, why did you
disappear for so long?

542
01:07:12,942 --> 01:07:14,003
Nothing.

543
01:07:14,514 --> 01:07:16,933
I just underwent therapy.

544
01:07:18,554 --> 01:07:21,390
Are you sick? What therapy?

545
01:07:22,124 --> 01:07:24,373
Nothing—

546
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,987
It's just for self-development.

547
01:07:28,388 --> 01:07:29,561
Nevermind.

548
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:32,470
That's it? I thought something
serious happened to you.

549
01:07:40,477 --> 01:07:42,687
I can only think of one problem.

550
01:07:43,792 --> 01:07:44,828
What?

551
01:07:45,546 --> 01:07:46,546
You.

552
01:07:46,712 --> 01:07:47,712
Me?

553
01:07:47,893 --> 01:07:48,893
Why me?

554
01:07:49,211 --> 01:07:51,209
I can't stop thinking about you.

555
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:56,020
Then whenever we're together,

556
01:07:56,515 --> 01:07:58,558
you don't feel any
excitement towards me,

557
01:08:00,028 --> 01:08:01,864
no matter what I do.

558
01:08:02,399 --> 01:08:05,443
I can't make you happy,
to be honest.

559
01:08:06,919 --> 01:08:07,936
Well,

560
01:08:08,652 --> 01:08:13,573
to be honest, I get bored
with a guy so clean,

561
01:08:13,979 --> 01:08:19,176
one who don’t have
any lustful thoughts.

562
01:08:19,963 --> 01:08:21,798
I don't feel happy.

563
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,669
That's why, allow me
to court you again,

564
01:08:29,018 --> 01:08:30,311
maybe this time,

565
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:33,037
you won't get bored.

566
01:08:34,023 --> 01:08:42,023
Of course! You know what Rowell,
you're handsome and a hunk,

567
01:08:43,196 --> 01:08:46,199
that's why a lot
of girls want you, like me,

568
01:08:47,267 --> 01:08:48,477
it's just that...

569
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,129
Did I pass?

570
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,326
With flying colors.

571
01:12:28,781 --> 01:12:30,967
If this was a class,
you'd get a perfect score.

572
01:12:34,979 --> 01:12:36,188
Are we together?

573
01:12:37,376 --> 01:12:38,460
One more?

574
01:12:39,541 --> 01:12:41,666
No, are we officially together?

575
01:12:42,163 --> 01:12:43,415
Ah!

576
01:12:43,832 --> 01:12:45,720
I thought you wanted another one.

577
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:47,388
Do you really need to ask?

578
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:52,884
Of course, we officially together.
