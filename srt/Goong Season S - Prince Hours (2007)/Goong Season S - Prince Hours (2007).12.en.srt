1
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:25,390
It is an honor to have both Prince Moonsung
and Your Highness visit my house.

2
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,620
Please sit over there.

3
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,530
No, it's okay.

4
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,380
Since you're part of the Imperial Court,
you should sit on the higher seat.

5
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,550
Not at all.

6
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,440
I was afraid you might not even let
me in because I'm an uninvited guest.

7
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,570
Thank you for letting me into your home.

8
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,420
Since you're the master of this
house, please sit over there.

9
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,375
Knowing how open-minded you two Princes are,

10
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:52,528
I don't have to worry about
this country's future.

11
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,620
What would you like to talk to me about?

12
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:06,470
Forgive me. I'm about you ask
you an unpleasant question.

13
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,660
I need to say something
unpleasant to you as well.

14
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,390
I already promised Prince Moonsung yesterday.

15
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,530
So, I think you made an unnecessary trip.

16
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,410
Yes, I'm glad you did that.

17
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,650
Actually, I'm here to ask you a question.

18
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:34,400
You see... I heard Master
Mooyoung's daughter loved you.

19
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,380
Didn't you love her as well?

20
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,650
Your Highness...

21
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,500
Do you know Prince Youngsung visited
Master Yangjoo's house today?

22
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,580
I was a bit offended.

23
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,580
We were supposed to work
separately on drawing and writing.

24
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,660
I feel as though he's invaded my territory.

25
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,390
But, then again, it'll be great for
the Imperial Court if we can get both,

26
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,620
regardless of the competition.

27
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:34,380
Maybe the two artisans are being
stubborn because of another reason.

28
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,610
Maybe.

29
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,838
I hope he doesn't ruin everything
by bringing up a part of their past

30
00:02:40,838 --> 00:02:44,279
that they don't want to talk about.

31
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:49,610
How come you only brought one cup of tea?

32
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,610
I asked you to join me.

33
00:02:52,620 --> 00:03:00,540
No, a mere residential attendant
cannot drink tea with you.

34
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,630
Joon.

35
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,660
Mother!

36
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,420
When did you get here?

37
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:19,520
You didn't even call or
tell a palace attendant.

38
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,670
Don't worry. I didn't come
here without permission.

39
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,580
I just talked to Lady Han.

40
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,460
I'll bring you a cup of tea.

41
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,550
I picked out a few books I'd like to read.

42
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,420
May I borrow them?

43
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,530
- Books?
- Yes.

44
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,570
You're late!

45
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,660
What should we eat for tonight's dinner?

46
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,620
I don't know.

47
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,500
We're done for the day!

48
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,540
- Good night.
- Good night.

49
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,660
Attendant Yang.

50
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,640
I need to talk to you.

51
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,590
Do you have time?

52
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,470
Yongnam, can you go home by yourself?

53
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,630
Oh, okay.

54
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,430
I decided to come here
because it's dinnertime.

55
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,460
- Should we order first?
- I'm fine.

56
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,510
What did you want to talk to me about?

57
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,550
We'll order later.

58
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:54,630
First of all, I'm sorry for everything
you went through because of the ring.

59
00:05:54,630 --> 00:06:01,460
I brought you here to tell you that.

60
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:09,520
I didn't know what to do after I
lost such a precious ring.

61
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,640
I hope you'll understand.

62
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,380
Don't worry, Your Highness.

63
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,630
Prince Moonsung must be
giving you a hard time.

64
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,560
Not at all.

65
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:40,630
Prince Moonsung is always
considerate of palace attendants.

66
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:47,430
We all respect him and want to serve him.

67
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:53,630
It's nice to hear that my son is popular.

68
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,670
What about you, Attendant Yang?

69
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:04,600
I don't want to beat around the bush.

70
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:08,650
I'll get straight to the point.

71
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:16,650
Have you ever thought of Prince
Moonsung as more than a Prince?

72
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,640
You know, as a man.

73
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:25,480
No, I have not.

74
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:32,630
If you don't have anything
else to say, I'd like to leave.

75
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,993
Are you telling me that I don't
need to worry about anything

76
00:07:43,993 --> 00:07:48,993
that might happen between
you and Prince Moonsung?

77
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:57,530
I don't know what you're thinking,
but that will never happen.

78
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,510
Can I ask you another question?

79
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:06,550
Do you like anyone right now?

80
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:15,520
Forgive me for not being able
to answer all your questions.

81
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,590
What happened?

82
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:43,510
Oh, I accidentally dropped my cup.

83
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,590
I'll clean it up. Don't worry about it.

84
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,500
Okay.

85
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:04,270
Ah!

86
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,670
What's wrong with me?

87
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,660
This isn't something to cry about.

88
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:52,560
Your Majesty, both of the
witness-participants are here.

89
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,570
I see.

90
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,570
Is Prince Youngsung here?

91
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:04,570
I don't think he's here yet.

92
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,660
I see.

93
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,424
Forgive me for saying this,

94
00:10:11,424 --> 00:10:19,026
but I don't think Prince Youngsung
has convinced Master Byuksoo yet.

95
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,510
You've brought Master Yangjoo?

96
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,650
Yes, Your Majesty.

97
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,590
I'm very proud of you.

98
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:01,510
Lady Han, is Prince Youngsung here yet?

99
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:04,640
No, Your Majesty.

100
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:18,380
Where is Master Yangjoo?

101
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:33,410
Your Majesty, I would like
to give you my salutations.

102
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,640
Thank you for coming.

103
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:51,490
And, thank you so much for accepting
Prince Moonsung's request.

104
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,761
Although I am unworthy,

105
00:11:55,761 --> 00:11:58,380
I came here because I heard I can
still be of service to Your Majesty.

106
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,440
I'm glad you're here.

107
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,590
Did you just get here?

108
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,420
Yes.

109
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,390
I'm a little late, Your Majesty.

110
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:48,460
What happened with Master Byuksoo?

111
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,670
Did you win his heart?

112
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,660
Yes, Your Majesty.

113
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:57,420
I'm a little late because I had
to bring Master Byuksoo.

114
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,440
Did you just say that Byuksoo is here?

115
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,540
Yes.

116
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,530
Is that true?

117
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:11,520
Is Master Byuksoo really here?

118
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

119
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,590
He's waiting in the lobby.

120
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,410
I have something to tell Master Yangjoo.

121
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,667
Master Byuksoo told me he would
restore "Gunsangokdo" with you

122
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:30,874
if you'll forgive him.

123
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:35,570
May I bring him inside?

124
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:39,420
I cannot dare tell a lie in your presence.

125
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,650
If Byuksoo really is here,
you should bring him inside.

126
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,450
Bring him in.

127
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,480
Byuksoo!

128
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:12,390
Yangjoo...

129
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:17,470
I'm sorry.

130
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,600
I was too narrow-minded.

131
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,480
No, it's not your fault.

132
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,470
You should first give your
salutions to Her Majesty.

133
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,460
This old and humble artisan would like to

134
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,650
offer up my belated salutations
to you, Your Majesty.

135
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,788
Please take your seats.

136
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:59,670
Thank you so much for coming.

137
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:10,460
It's such a joy to this Imperial Court to
have two master craftsmen here with us.

138
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,420
We're honored, Your Majesty.

139
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,620
Prince Youngsung.

140
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:22,480
Can you explain what happened?

141
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,540
Yes, Your Majesty.

142
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,480
I jotted down what I wanted to say.

143
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,670
May I refer to my notes?

144
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:34,420
Yes, do that.

145
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,550
I'll begin with what happened
between these two people.

146
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:46,325
Master Byuksoo secretly admired
Master Mooyoung's daughter Hyeran,

147
00:15:46,325 --> 00:15:51,530
but found out that she loved his
friend Master Yangjoo, not him.

148
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:56,660
But, Master Byuksoo kept this to
himself without telling anyone.

149
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:04,650
When Master Yangjoo found out about
his friend's feelings, he turned her down.

150
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:10,510
Hyeran committed suicide out of grief.

151
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:17,400
When Master Mooyoung died from
shock, things got even more serious.

152
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,660
Master Yangjoo ended up leaving his master.

153
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,867
But, Master Byuksoo didn't know that

154
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:27,570
and misunderstood
Master Yangjoo all these years.

155
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:33,380
But, now they both know what really happened.

156
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,590
That is all.

157
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,560
Master Yangjoo, is this true?

158
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,460
That's right, Your Majesty.

159
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:53,490
I knew Byuksoo had feelings for Hyeran.

160
00:16:53,490 --> 00:17:04,630
I had no idea Yangjoo turned
Hyeran down because of me.

161
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:15,681
I've hated Yangjoo all these
years out of jealousy

162
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:19,520
because she loved Yangjoo, not me.

163
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,460
This is all my fault.

164
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:31,390
How did you know all this, Prince Youngsung?

165
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:35,520
My Royal Academy schoolmate,
Saeryung, helped me.

166
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:44,590
She told me the poem might
be about friendship, not love.

167
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,510
I took her idea and gave it some thought.

168
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:52,630
I don't know if I guessed
right, but here it is.

169
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:56,990
My guess is that Emperor Ikjo chose that poem

170
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:04,550
as a tribute to his friendship
with his cousins.

171
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:10,213
But, Master Byuksoo thought
that poem was about love

172
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:16,540
because his heart was filled
with love towards Hyeran.

173
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:21,420
That's why he drew a man and a
woman longing for each other.

174
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:29,098
When Emperor Ikjo saw that the artwork
was different from his original intentions,

175
00:18:29,098 --> 00:18:33,450
he ordered the wedding rings to be made.

176
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,530
Then, he gave them to his cousins.

177
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:42,000
If Emperor Ikjo didn't consider that
as love between a man and woman,

178
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,630
then why would he make
wedding rings from that verse?

179
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:51,600
I think this is my time to speak.

180
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:24,450
I guess I'm the one who can tell the truth
about what everyone is talking about.

181
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:33,510
Emperor Ikjo was very distressed
after he became Crown Prince.

182
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,924
According to royal custom,

183
00:19:37,924 --> 00:19:42,570
the other princes besides the chosen
Crown Prince needed to leave the palace.

184
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:55,620
He was sad to see his cousins, with
whom grew up, leave the palace.

185
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:05,640
Although I was very young at that time,
I remember how mournful Emperor Ikjo was.

186
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:16,846
After Ikjo ascended to the throne,
he ordered "Gunsangokdo" to be drawn

187
00:20:16,846 --> 00:20:20,530
in order to console his cousins,
but something went wrong.

188
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:27,650
I was very surprised to hear
Prince Youngsung's report.

189
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:34,510
He guessed right.

190
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:42,560
Ikjo actually laughed after he saw how
the meaning of the poem had changed.

191
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,620
I think he thought it was funny.

192
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:52,590
Then, he ordered a jeweler to make a ring.

193
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,430
There were three rings in all.

194
00:20:56,430 --> 00:21:04,510
He sent one ring each to Grand Princes
Hyoin, Hyosung, and Hyojang.

195
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:12,630
That's how the royal
wedding rings were made.

196
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:18,091
Like you heard, "Gunsangokdo"
and the rings symbolize the friendship

197
00:21:18,091 --> 00:21:23,520
between Emperor Ikjo and our three uncles.

198
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:30,530
This is why I selected this
as your first assignment.

199
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,710
I wanted the two Princes to remember that

200
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:46,490
although you're competing against each other,
you must not lose your friendship.

201
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:53,430
I salute your thoughtful and wise
choice for the assignment.

202
00:21:53,450 --> 00:22:00,410
Now, who won the first assignment?

203
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,310
Prince Moonsung received
Master Yangjoo's permission

204
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:08,994
before Prince Youngsung did.

205
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:15,490
He faithfully followed my first guidelines.

206
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:22,490
Based on this alone,
Prince Moonsung should win.

207
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:30,660
Prince Youngsung was behind Prince
Moonsung in convincing Master Byuksoo.

208
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:43,540
But, he found the hidden meaning behind the
artwork, and reconciled the two masters.

209
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:49,640
He saved a cultural asset
that might've been lost forever.

210
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:56,640
Who do you think won, Grand Prince?

211
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,650
Prince Youngsung won.

212
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,410
- Oh, my! Really?
- Yes!

213
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:14,390
Then, we shouldn't call him
a troublemaker anymore!

214
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:18,380
I can't believe it. Prince Moonsung lost?

215
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,620
- I can't believe it!
- I can't believe it!

216
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,550
That was a good one.

217
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,510
Congratulations.

218
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,460
I was just lucky.

219
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,440
Thank you.

220
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:43,390
I won't let you win next time.

221
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,410
I don't understand.

222
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:08,650
Joon is the one who
brought that artisan first!

223
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:18,560
And, I can't believe Saeryung
helped Prince Youngsung!

224
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,610
I'm so mad at her!

225
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:28,530
It's Joon's fault for not showing
up at the engagement ceremony.

226
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,430
Let's leave the past behind us
and prepare ourselves for what's ahead.

227
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:41,510
Those who linger on the past will
lose even what they have right now.

228
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:06,400
I was very impressed by Prince Youngsung.

229
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,490
What do you think?

230
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,610
What do you mean?

231
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,778
Now that the engagement is off,

232
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:17,620
it'll be silly to reconcile
with Grand Prince Hyojang.

233
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:25,600
Our only option is Prince Youngsung
now... for both you and for me.

234
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,550
Dad.

235
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:32,431
I'm a little disturbed the Empress Dowager
was present at the engagement ceremony,

236
00:25:32,431 --> 00:25:35,420
but luckily, Prince Youngsung needs you.

237
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:39,520
We still have a chance.

238
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,420
Your Highness!

239
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:39,590
Congratulations, Your Highness.

240
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,440
Thank you... truly.

241
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,530
Good afternoon, Miss Saeryung!

242
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:55,640
Congratulations.

243
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,580
I brought you a gift.

244
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:02,540
It's a cello CD. It'll make you feel good.

245
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,650
Thank you.

246
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,650
I should've gotten you a gift instead.

247
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,500
This is all thanks to you.

248
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,650
Thank you.

249
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:21,470
I'm happy to hear that I could be of help.

250
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:27,500
If you need my service in the future,
I'm more than willing to help you.

251
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,450
I'd like to be alone. Can't
you work on that later?

252
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,480
Sure, I'll do that.

253
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:50,560
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

254
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:57,410
You must be happy seeing your schoolmate win.

255
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:01,520
How do you feel?

256
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:15,560
I always liked how honest you are,
but I want to hear you lie to me today.

257
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:24,520
This is so surreal because I've never
lost anything in my life before.

258
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:35,400
Knowing you're not on my
side makes me feel even sadder.

259
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,600
I know you did your best.

260
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:42,660
If I were you, I wouldn't
be ashamed of losing.

261
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:46,670
Then... please get some rest.

262
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:01,261
[Prince Hours]

263
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:16,670
What's this?

264
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:20,410
I keep this hidden
in the office refrigerator.

265
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,520
Try it.

266
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:27,460
You want me to eat this?
In the middle of the night?

267
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,400
Bite into it!

268
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,460
It'll make you feel so much better.

269
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,660
That's what I do when I'm frustrated.

270
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:37,642
It'll help.

271
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:40,695
How do I...

272
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,540
It's good.

273
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,660
You've never tried this before?

274
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:27,630
No, I've never had anything
with a stick in it like this.

275
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:31,380
My mother didn't give me a lot of sweets.

276
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:37,600
Have you ever gone to the
dentist because of cavities?

277
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:44,580
Cavities? No.

278
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,620
You've never been to a dentist before?

279
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:52,530
You don't know how rough life can be.

280
00:30:52,530 --> 00:31:02,380
No, I know how scary dentists can be.

281
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,470
You're actually afraid of something?

282
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:14,640
All the pictures I took from ages
15 to 17 are with my mouth closed.

283
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:17,560
Why?

284
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:22,470
Did you have braces?

285
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,620
You got it.

286
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:35,660
Dentists are scary. They really are.

287
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,480
I better get going.

288
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,450
If you're done with that,
please give me the stick.

289
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,420
Why?

290
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:50,380
If anyone finds this in the trashcan, all
the palace attendants will get in trouble.

291
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:57,414
Your job is much tougher than it seems

292
00:31:57,414 --> 00:32:05,480
than what people imagine
from the outside, isn't it?

293
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:09,410
No, there are plenty of
harder jobs out there.

294
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:15,627
But, then again, time goes much slower
inside the palace than it does outside.

295
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:26,500
At least it won't stop as long
as we have people like you.

296
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:32,470
Since we can't do much about that right
now, good luck on the entrance exam.

297
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:36,400
I hope I get to see you at the Royal Academy.

298
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:44,420
Teach me things I can't learn from a book.

299
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,660
It's great to see this work
completely restored.

300
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,520
I'm so proud of Princes
Youngsung and Moonsung.

301
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:18,480
Mother, why don't we display this work
so that all the citizens can enjoy it?

302
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:23,540
- Oh, Empress! That's a great idea!
- Isn't it?

303
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:30,809
We should display the wedding rings together
with the artwork to honor its meaning.

304
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:43,530
It'll be meaningful to gather all three
rings together at the same time.

305
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,490
Is that true?

306
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:54,650
That's correct.

307
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,761
Her Majesty's proposal was accepted,

308
00:33:57,761 --> 00:34:02,761
and "Gunsangokdo" and the wedding
rings will be displayed together.

309
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,410
That's great!

310
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:21,440
Her Majesty is volunteering
to corner Prince Youngsung.

311
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:40,860
You have grown more
perceptive under my watch.

312
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:47,104
- Oh!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry, sir.

313
00:34:47,104 --> 00:34:52,338
Ah, my nose! These kinds of
incidents need to stop now.

Ah... Umph...

315
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:06,214
Mmm... I had the same thoughts.

316
00:35:07,163 --> 00:35:11,499
A question about the wedding
rings will definitely appear.

317
00:35:12,107 --> 00:35:18,143
Answer is... Shambala, shambala,
shambala.... Number three!

318
00:35:18,648 --> 00:35:20,394
Give it to me.

319
00:35:28,112 --> 00:35:33,946
Shambala... Fail! And even if you
pass, only after the third time!

320
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:37,092
Ah!

321
00:35:45,806 --> 00:35:47,522

00:36:28,305 --> 00:36:30,881
Has there been a public announcement?

325
00:36:32,528 --> 00:36:36,294
It hasn't proceeded as far as that.

326
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,214
The formal correspondence
which needs to be delivered

327
00:36:38,214 --> 00:36:42,320
to each of the Grand Princes'
residences must be written.

328
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,904
There are many other details

329
00:36:44,904 --> 00:36:47,488
like exhibit location and method to
be used which must be examined.

330
00:36:48,534 --> 00:36:51,038
Hmmm... I see.

331
00:36:51,038 --> 00:36:54,405
Is there... something that isn't...

332
00:36:55,649 --> 00:37:00,169
What if my parents oppose the exhibit?
Then, what will happen?

333
00:37:17,051 --> 00:37:18,610
Ah! That scared me...

334
00:37:21,036 --> 00:37:23,760
Geez, maybe because it's an
Imperial cell phone used by a royal,

335
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,038
the ring tone seems more elegant.

Prince Moonsung all of a sudden?

because you come so much.

It's so pretty! Royals are
really different from us.

Yes. This is Jipyong Tower.
Is this the royal kitchen?

347
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:32,085
This is an emergency. She's a light eater.

348
00:38:44,814 --> 00:38:49,462
We've caused nothing but
trouble for each other.

349
00:38:55,446 --> 00:38:58,651
I need to find Prince Youngsung's ring.

350
00:38:58,651 --> 00:39:03,381
You know my house better than I do.

351
00:39:03,381 --> 00:39:07,749
I'm sure you know where
my mother hid the ring.

352
00:39:10,779 --> 00:39:15,286
No matter how many times you ask,
I can't help you with that.

353
00:39:16,181 --> 00:39:18,670
Even if I ask you as a friend?

354
00:39:21,508 --> 00:39:23,147
Siyun...

355
00:39:26,682 --> 00:39:28,310
I'm sorry.

356
00:40:34,038 --> 00:40:36,445
What are you doing here?

357
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:51,876
Joon. How dare you...

358
00:40:51,876 --> 00:40:56,415
Mother, please.

359
00:40:56,415 --> 00:40:58,436
Give the ring back to its rightful owner.

360
00:40:58,436 --> 00:41:03,143
What are you talking about?
I don't understand why you're doing this!

361
00:41:03,546 --> 00:41:04,899
I'm your mom!

362
00:41:05,259 --> 00:41:06,159
Mother...

363
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:08,994
I lost the ring and then found it.

364
00:41:08,994 --> 00:41:10,795
It's over now.

365
00:41:11,248 --> 00:41:16,259
Is that girl, Attendant Yang or whatever,
putting ideas in your head?

366
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,743
If not, then how can you do this to me?

367
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:22,193
She didn't do anything wrong.

368
00:41:23,743 --> 00:41:27,343
Shouldn't you be the one who's sorry?

369
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,792
What? What did you say?

370
00:41:32,816 --> 00:41:36,446
How can you defend her in front of me?

371
00:41:41,923 --> 00:41:43,757
Joon!

372
00:41:43,757 --> 00:41:45,024
Joon!

373
00:42:02,127 --> 00:42:08,362
Do you remember what you
told me the last time we met?

374
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:11,771
I thought I didn't need
to worry about anything

375
00:42:11,771 --> 00:42:15,080
that might happen
between you and Prince Moonsung.

376
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:18,713
Did I hear you incorrectly?

377
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:25,242
Prince Moonsung came to our house yesterday.

378
00:42:26,967 --> 00:42:29,386
Did you tell him...

379
00:42:29,386 --> 00:42:30,983
Your Highness...

380
00:42:34,501 --> 00:42:36,035
What is it?

381
00:42:37,364 --> 00:42:48,629
I know that the ring Lady Han gave back
to you belongs to Prince Youngsung.

382
00:42:52,538 --> 00:42:56,679
As I said before, I didn't do it.

383
00:42:58,946 --> 00:43:09,578
And, I don't think Prince Youngsung's
ring should be in your hands.

384
00:43:10,687 --> 00:43:13,231
What are you talking about?

385
00:43:13,231 --> 00:43:16,596
Your Highness, please
return the ring back to him.

386
00:43:19,634 --> 00:43:22,935
If you do...

387
00:43:22,935 --> 00:43:27,687
If you return the ring back to him,
I'll do whatever you say.

388
00:43:31,046 --> 00:43:33,645
You'll do whatever I say?

389
00:43:48,035 --> 00:43:49,731
Your Highness.

390
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,011
I'm sorry for the grief I caused
you because of the ring.

391
00:43:57,011 --> 00:44:00,797
I don't deserve to say this,
but please don't worry.

392
00:44:00,797 --> 00:44:02,879
Everything will be okay.

393
00:44:02,879 --> 00:44:06,040
Thank you for your concern.

394
00:44:14,348 --> 00:44:17,486
I'll leave the tea on the table.

395
00:44:18,029 --> 00:44:19,413
Sure, do that.

396
00:44:58,046 --> 00:45:01,176
What's going on?
You suggesting we come here...

397
00:45:01,931 --> 00:45:05,426
Since your complexion hasn't
been looking so good lately,

398
00:45:05,426 --> 00:45:08,427
I was going to bring you here
anyway, so it's just as well.

399
00:45:08,427 --> 00:45:10,451
Let's go!

400
00:45:13,783 --> 00:45:15,302
I think you need this.

401
00:45:17,794 --> 00:45:19,137
Dark circles?

402
00:45:20,966 --> 00:45:24,058
Ah... Why are you so puffy? Are you tired?

403
00:45:38,506 --> 00:45:39,444
Are you going to buy it?

404
00:45:39,444 --> 00:45:45,050
Lately, fermented natural cosmetics
are becoming popular.

405
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:46,866
I do like it...

406
00:45:46,866 --> 00:45:48,755
Hand it to me.

407
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:54,778
How much is this?

408
00:45:54,778 --> 00:45:59,758
Here, take it. This is
the new fermented line.

409
00:45:59,973 --> 00:46:04,038
Hey! What's wrong all of a sudden?
It's not even my birthday?

410
00:46:04,038 --> 00:46:10,169
Don't worry about it. I wanted to buy
it for you because I'm grateful.

411
00:46:10,169 --> 00:46:12,165
To me? You're thankful?

412
00:46:12,165 --> 00:46:14,337
Yes! Very much.

413
00:46:14,337 --> 00:46:18,477
I don't know what's going on,
but since I got a gift, I feel good.

414
00:46:18,477 --> 00:46:21,858
Thank you. Let's go.

415
00:46:25,836 --> 00:46:28,033
Cheers!

416
00:46:32,281 --> 00:46:32,781
Right!

417
00:46:43,061 --> 00:46:45,309
Aren't you overdoing it?

418
00:46:45,656 --> 00:46:47,397
It's okay. It's okay!

419
00:46:47,397 --> 00:46:52,116
Compared to what you bought for me, this is
only good etiquette. Don't you think?

420
00:46:53,636 --> 00:47:00,138
You! This is why you can
never save, but thank you.

421
00:47:09,351 --> 00:47:10,911
- Yongnam...
- Huh?

422
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:19,794
We... we're friends, right?
We're... friends to the end, right?

423
00:47:19,794 --> 00:47:21,775
Why are you talking that way?

424
00:47:21,775 --> 00:47:23,711
Is our friendship just
like any old friendship?

425
00:47:23,711 --> 00:47:32,041
Don't worry! We're always together whether
in the palace or outside. Isn't that right?

426
00:47:33,758 --> 00:47:40,251
Yes! You're right. Let's toast
to our everlasting friendship!

427
00:47:40,251 --> 00:47:41,730
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

428
00:47:42,873 --> 00:47:48,153
Ah! Another toast to your passing
Academy admissions exam.

429
00:47:48,153 --> 00:47:49,971
Cheers!

430
00:48:04,219 --> 00:48:07,242
[Prince Hours]

431
00:48:09,659 --> 00:48:11,667
Attendant Yang!

432
00:48:12,859 --> 00:48:14,939
Is it true?

433
00:48:14,939 --> 00:48:18,839
Are you really transferring
to the district palace?

434
00:48:19,729 --> 00:48:21,759
What is he talking about?

435
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,919
District palace?

436
00:48:22,919 --> 00:48:25,869
Why?

437
00:48:26,689 --> 00:48:27,949
That's right.

438
00:48:28,669 --> 00:48:32,749
I requested to be transferred to
a district palace a few days ago.

439
00:48:33,709 --> 00:48:36,869
It's much closer to my parents' place.

440
00:48:36,869 --> 00:48:42,829
Maybe I've been away from home
for too long. I miss my parents.

441
00:48:42,829 --> 00:48:49,819
I think it'll be better if I work as a
palace attendant near my parents.

442
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:54,949
I'm sorry for not telling
you guys in advance.

443
00:49:06,739 --> 00:49:08,809
Tell me the truth.

444
00:49:09,889 --> 00:49:15,789
You've been studying to
attend the Royal Academy.

445
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:17,919
Did you do that for nothing?

446
00:49:17,939 --> 00:49:23,949
You stayed up several nights studying,
and now you want to go to a district palace?

447
00:49:23,949 --> 00:49:26,939
Do you expect me to believe that?

448
00:49:27,669 --> 00:49:28,789
Yongnam.

449
00:49:28,809 --> 00:49:31,939
Something happened, right?

450
00:49:33,769 --> 00:49:39,669
You should've talked to me before
making a decision like that.

451
00:49:39,669 --> 00:49:41,789
I'm sorry, Yongnam.

452
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,679
I'm really sorry.

453
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:48,929
Come visit me when you're on vacation.

454
00:49:49,659 --> 00:49:52,799
You dork...

455
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:02,889
I heard Saeryung helped you
a lot with this assignment.

456
00:50:04,889 --> 00:50:07,849
Did you get very far?

457
00:50:07,849 --> 00:50:10,689
We're not like that.

458
00:50:10,699 --> 00:50:11,729
Why?

459
00:50:11,749 --> 00:50:13,819
You two look cute together.

460
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:18,739
There's a rumor going around
that you two are dating.

461
00:50:18,759 --> 00:50:20,739
Stop it, guys.

462
00:50:20,739 --> 00:50:24,288
Hey, that palace attendant
we saw at the party

463
00:50:24,288 --> 00:50:27,799
came to the Royal Academy
to submit her application.

464
00:50:27,799 --> 00:50:31,779
Maybe she wants to be a Royal
Academy student-attendant.

465
00:50:31,809 --> 00:50:34,779
I hope she makes it.

466
00:50:34,789 --> 00:50:37,899
I'm so going to hit on her.

467
00:50:37,899 --> 00:50:40,769
I'm warning you.

468
00:50:40,789 --> 00:50:43,909
You better not lay a finger
on Attendant Yang.

469
00:50:43,939 --> 00:50:45,919
You're getting feisty all of a sudden.

470
00:50:45,949 --> 00:50:48,939
Are you protecting her because
she's your residential attendant?

471
00:50:49,659 --> 00:50:50,919
Are you sure you're not interested in her?

472
00:50:50,919 --> 00:50:53,332
How can you be attracted to someone else

473
00:50:53,332 --> 00:50:54,809
when you have a girl like
Saeryung next to you?

474
00:50:54,809 --> 00:50:57,819
I said, it's not like that.

475
00:50:58,719 --> 00:51:01,729
I think I heard you say my name.

476
00:51:01,749 --> 00:51:05,789
Were you three saying bad things
about me behind my back?

477
00:51:05,789 --> 00:51:07,849
No way...

478
00:51:07,869 --> 00:51:16,739
We might praise your beauty, but never
say bad things behind your back.

479
00:51:16,759 --> 00:51:22,859
We have somewhere to go. Excuse us.

480
00:51:23,939 --> 00:51:26,789
Bye, Hoo!

481
00:51:31,849 --> 00:51:37,909
You should at least try taking
the exam before you leave.

482
00:51:38,779 --> 00:51:44,215
I know how nervous you can
get before exam day,

483
00:51:44,215 --> 00:51:49,809
but you don't have to run away
to the middle of nowhere.

484
00:51:49,809 --> 00:51:54,839
Don't say it's the middle of nowhere.

485
00:51:54,839 --> 00:51:56,919
To be honest, working
at the district palace is...

486
00:51:56,939 --> 00:52:00,759
perfect for me.

487
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:11,829
Can you excuse us for a minute?

488
00:52:30,749 --> 00:52:36,879
You must've had a tough time
managing someone like me.

489
00:52:37,889 --> 00:52:41,908
I don't know when that will be,

490
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:46,819
but I'll come back after
I become a better person.

491
00:52:46,819 --> 00:52:50,929
Let me ask you one question.

492
00:52:51,769 --> 00:53:00,069
Are you trying to control your attitude
as a palace attendant alone,

493
00:53:00,069 --> 00:53:04,919
or your heart as a woman as well?

494
00:53:04,919 --> 00:53:07,769
Don't be surprised.

495
00:53:07,799 --> 00:53:17,879
Time can make a person's sight become
dim, but her observations clearer.

496
00:53:18,889 --> 00:53:22,869
I'm so sorry.

497
00:53:24,789 --> 00:53:32,260
That's why I didn't stop you,

498
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:40,939
but avoiding the problem will
only be a temporary solution.

499
00:53:40,939 --> 00:53:51,749
I hope this journey will give you
the courage to seek the answer.

500
00:53:52,709 --> 00:53:56,929
I'm sorry, Lady Han.

501
00:54:17,889 --> 00:54:21,709
Your Highness, I brought your clothes.

502
00:54:21,739 --> 00:54:25,729
Since when did you start attending to me?

503
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:28,839
Both of the attendants are not here today.

504
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:29,909
Why?

505
00:54:29,909 --> 00:54:31,919
Attendant Ma went home early for the day.

506
00:54:31,949 --> 00:54:37,689
Attendant Yang is going to be
transferred to a district palace.

507
00:54:37,689 --> 00:54:40,809
I know this is all of a sudden,
but please be more understanding...

508
00:54:40,829 --> 00:54:42,659
Is Lady Han in?

509
00:54:42,659 --> 00:54:45,769
Your Highness! What about your clothes?

510
00:54:58,899 --> 00:55:00,939
Geez, since you've been
freeloading off of me all this time,

511
00:55:00,939 --> 00:55:03,779
you don't have anything to take with you.

512
00:55:03,799 --> 00:55:07,669
I threw away the things
I don't need anymore.

513
00:55:07,669 --> 00:55:10,679
Besides, I'm not going to
the middle of nowhere.

514
00:55:10,689 --> 00:55:13,689
Whatever.

515
00:55:15,799 --> 00:55:19,749
Come on, don't be mad. Okay?

516
00:55:30,749 --> 00:55:34,719
What's this? Why?

517
00:55:34,749 --> 00:55:36,759
I'm not giving it to you.

518
00:55:36,779 --> 00:55:38,849
I'm just letting you borrow it.

519
00:55:38,869 --> 00:55:43,859
Don't give this to your parents.
Use it when you need it.

520
00:55:43,859 --> 00:55:45,769
I'm okay.

521
00:55:45,789 --> 00:55:47,819
I already know how much you make.

522
00:55:47,819 --> 00:55:49,759
Be quiet.

523
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:54,799
You should take some money with
you when you go to a new place.

524
00:56:00,829 --> 00:56:01,929
Even your seal?

525
00:56:01,949 --> 00:56:05,789
If I wire you money,
you'll only wire it back to me.

526
00:56:05,809 --> 00:56:09,396
Just take it, even if you're
not going to use it...

527
00:56:09,396 --> 00:56:11,762
unless you're never going to see me again.

528
00:56:15,729 --> 00:56:17,849
And, take this, too.

529
00:56:17,879 --> 00:56:20,809
It might be hard to fall asleep in a new bed.

530
00:56:20,829 --> 00:56:23,929
You can use this as a pillow.

531
00:56:35,702 --> 00:56:36,202
Um...

532
00:56:40,929 --> 00:56:42,739
Your Highness...

533
00:56:42,759 --> 00:56:45,719
Is Attendant Yang home?

534
00:56:45,739 --> 00:56:47,859
Please wait a moment.

535
00:57:05,929 --> 00:57:10,859
Your Highness, I'm afraid
someone might see us.

536
00:57:10,879 --> 00:57:13,779
What did my mother do this time?

537
00:57:13,779 --> 00:57:16,939
She didn't do anything.
Then, why are you leaving?

538
00:57:16,939 --> 00:57:18,749
Your Highness.

539
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:21,859
Is it because of Prince
Youngsung's wedding ring?

540
00:57:21,859 --> 00:57:23,949
You can't do anything about that.

541
00:57:24,669 --> 00:57:26,939
I'll take care of it!

542
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:29,849
It's already been decided.

543
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:33,889
What about the Royal Academy exam?

544
00:57:34,669 --> 00:57:35,759
I don't think I'll pass.

545
00:57:35,779 --> 00:57:37,929
You've got to be kidding me!

546
00:57:37,929 --> 00:57:44,919
Even if you don't think you'll pass,
that can't be your reason for leaving!

547
00:57:44,929 --> 00:57:46,646
You said yourself that it'll be hard to work

548
00:57:46,646 --> 00:57:52,774
and prepare for the Royal Academy
exam at the same time.

549
00:57:56,779 --> 00:57:58,779
You were right.

550
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:05,689
I had too much work to do at Jipyoung Tower.

551
00:58:05,689 --> 00:58:08,869
It was also very stressful.

552
00:58:08,869 --> 00:58:17,929
Talking to you today has made me
more confident about my decision.

553
00:58:17,929 --> 00:58:20,759
I'm having a hard time
taking care of my own self.

554
00:58:20,759 --> 00:58:25,889
I can't take it if other people disturb me.

555
00:58:25,889 --> 00:58:34,869
You're too much an important person
to be caught up by a passing current.

556
00:58:36,699 --> 00:58:39,909
A passing current?

557
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:50,809
Do you even know what
I'm dealing with right now?

558
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:59,899
I know people should be
more aware of reality.

559
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:05,889
You have a lot of learning to do.

560
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:08,499
Like you said before,
there are things in this world

561
00:59:08,499 --> 00:59:13,499
that can't be learned from school or books.

562
00:59:14,809 --> 00:59:22,839
And, that's why you shouldn't think that
Prince Youngsung is way behind you.

563
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:25,839
I know I don't deserve to say that.

564
00:59:27,739 --> 00:59:30,729
Forgive me.

565
00:59:31,729 --> 00:59:37,819
Thank you so much for being
kind to me all this time.

566
00:59:38,939 --> 00:59:42,669
Goodbye.

567
01:00:26,879 --> 01:00:34,899
Your Highness, a new attendant has
been assigned to Jipyoung Tower.

568
01:00:35,749 --> 01:00:41,809
Starting from today, Attendant
Yoo will replace Attendant Yang.

569
01:00:41,809 --> 01:00:45,909
Attendant Yang was transferred on
a short notice.

570
01:00:46,699 --> 01:00:50,769
Forgive me for not telling
you ahead of time.

571
01:00:50,769 --> 01:00:55,889
Attendant Yang has been transferred?

572
01:01:20,899 --> 01:01:22,949
What happened?

573
01:01:22,949 --> 01:01:24,659
What's this?

574
01:01:24,679 --> 01:01:26,699
It's the wedding ring!

575
01:01:26,699 --> 01:01:28,899
I gave it to you to give to the Duchess.

576
01:01:28,919 --> 01:01:31,669
And I got it back!

577
01:01:32,909 --> 01:01:35,859
Attendant Yang was transferred
to a district palace.

578
01:01:35,879 --> 01:01:38,899
Does that have anything to do with this?

579
01:01:39,889 --> 01:01:41,779
Prince Moonsung!

580
01:01:42,749 --> 01:01:44,919
I'll take care of this.

581
01:01:44,919 --> 01:01:47,779
Leave it to me.

582
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:52,699
This is why I told you not
to tell her, you jerk!

583
01:01:56,689 --> 01:02:01,679
I'm sorry. It just came out.

584
01:02:21,729 --> 01:02:23,899
Take care.

585
01:02:23,899 --> 01:02:26,859
I'll call you when I get there.

586
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:42,679
Take care.

587
01:02:43,729 --> 01:02:49,719
Yongnam... thank you.

588
01:02:56,699 --> 01:02:58,699
Bye.

589
01:03:18,949 --> 01:03:22,919
Attendant Ma? Where's Attendant Yang?

590
01:03:24,699 --> 01:03:25,839
She left.

591
01:03:25,869 --> 01:03:29,689
Where to?

592
01:03:48,229 --> 01:03:49,949
[Prince Hours]

593
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:54,798
Do you know what this is?

594
01:03:54,798 --> 01:03:59,202
As you can see, "Gunsangokdo"
is in horrible condition.

595
01:03:59,202 --> 01:04:02,335
I expect you two to do your
best on your first assignment.

596
01:04:02,335 --> 01:04:03,746
I think I'll go with the painting.

597
01:04:03,746 --> 01:04:05,128
Then, I'll go with the writing.

598
01:04:05,128 --> 01:04:08,395
Remember, we decided to play fairly.

599
01:04:08,395 --> 01:04:09,184
Of course.

600
01:04:09,184 --> 01:04:11,418
It's been many years since
I last restored artwork.

601
01:04:11,418 --> 01:04:14,996
Please don't ask me anymore.

602
01:04:14,996 --> 01:04:16,681
Please restore the work.

603
01:04:16,681 --> 01:04:20,552
It's been a long time since
I thought about that work.

604
01:04:20,552 --> 01:04:25,971
Duck, rabbit...

605
01:04:25,971 --> 01:04:29,552
I will participate in the
restoration project.

606
01:04:29,552 --> 01:04:33,826
I will never participate in
the restoration project.

607
01:04:33,826 --> 01:04:35,714
I'm here to ask you a question.

608
01:04:35,714 --> 01:04:41,376
I was very surprised to hear Prince
Youngsung's report. He guessed right.

609
01:04:41,376 --> 01:04:46,269
Who do you think won, Grand Prince?

610
01:04:46,269 --> 01:04:49,110
Congratulations, Your Highness.

611
01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:51,472
Thank you... truly.
