1
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,261
Everything's fine.

2
00:00:26,344 --> 00:00:29,261
I'm not that strong, you know.

3
00:00:36,926 --> 00:00:38,094
Your Highness.

4
00:00:39,926 --> 00:00:41,926
Open the door.

5
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:05,926
I know you're friends, but I
think you're too close.

6
00:01:05,926 --> 00:01:08,302
What if other people see you?

7
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:10,678
I'll be more careful next time.

8
00:02:04,926 --> 00:02:07,136
Oh, my head...

9
00:02:09,094 --> 00:02:11,926
How much did I drink last night?

10
00:02:26,094 --> 00:02:29,678
Where did the honeyed water come from?

11
00:02:47,926 --> 00:02:51,052
Did I black out?

12
00:02:51,177 --> 00:03:01,926
I said bye to my friends, came back
to the palace, and... back to my room.

13
00:03:01,926 --> 00:03:05,553
You really don't remember anything?

14
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:07,428
No.

15
00:03:07,428 --> 00:03:10,926
You don't even remember calling me?

16
00:03:10,926 --> 00:03:12,926
I called you?

17
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,010
Why?

18
00:03:17,926 --> 00:03:22,606
You mean you were just drunk, right?

19
00:03:22,606 --> 00:03:25,146
Yeah...

20
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:32,926
Did I do something wrong?

21
00:03:32,926 --> 00:03:36,177
Something must've happened.

22
00:03:36,177 --> 00:03:38,926
I was drunk. I'm sure I didn't mean it.

23
00:03:40,177 --> 00:03:42,010
What did I do?

24
00:03:42,094 --> 00:03:46,511
Did I say something wrong?

25
00:03:47,926 --> 00:03:49,926
If you call me when you're
drunk one more time,

26
00:03:49,926 --> 00:03:52,926
I'm never going to talk to you again!

27
00:03:54,927 --> 00:03:57,052
Yang Sooneui!

28
00:03:57,052 --> 00:03:58,469
Yang Sooneui!

29
00:04:01,926 --> 00:04:04,926
How embarrassing!

30
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:21,926
What a jerk...

31
00:04:21,926 --> 00:04:27,052
I can't believe you don't remember anything.

32
00:04:46,926 --> 00:04:50,926
This wild tea is delicious.

33
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:59,926
Thank you all for your input.

34
00:04:59,926 --> 00:05:09,927
I believe I should accept your request
to install the Crown Prince immediately.

35
00:05:09,927 --> 00:05:12,969
This is my position.

36
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:16,969
I want Prince Youngsung
to be the Crown Prince.

37
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,719
Y-your Majesty!

38
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,052
Prince Youngsung?

39
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:22,428
That cannot be!

40
00:05:25,094 --> 00:05:27,926
Are you saying no then?

41
00:05:27,926 --> 00:05:30,261
You want me to install the Crown Prince,

42
00:05:30,261 --> 00:05:37,553
but not Prince Youngsung who
is the first in line to succeed?

43
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:44,926
Are you asking me to make
Prince Moonsung my successor?

44
00:05:44,926 --> 00:05:49,386
Is that why everyone rushed here together?

45
00:05:54,926 --> 00:06:05,052
Prince Youngsung never learned how
to be dignified like a Crown Prince.

46
00:06:05,094 --> 00:06:11,594
Give him some time to learn.

47
00:06:11,594 --> 00:06:14,926
Let's wait for him.

48
00:06:14,927 --> 00:06:23,261
It takes a lot of time and effort
to make wild tea taste good.

49
00:06:31,926 --> 00:06:36,926
We've been had by the young Empress.

50
00:06:39,136 --> 00:06:45,136
Postponing the installation will
be to Joon's disadvantage.

51
00:06:45,136 --> 00:06:48,926
What are you doing to do?

52
00:06:48,927 --> 00:06:57,177
What would you do if a deer appears
on rabbit-hunting grounds?

53
00:07:20,136 --> 00:07:24,177
Everyone must've been shocked.

54
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:29,261
I'm glad that you stood firm.

55
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:38,926
I've been trying to avoid
conflict for the past 7 years.

56
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:46,010
I always thought, "I'll just give
in and make everyone happy."

57
00:07:48,052 --> 00:07:56,926
I now know I must face the
problem head-on if I want it solved.

58
00:07:56,926 --> 00:08:06,261
Meeting the Deputy Prime Minister
is part of facing the problem.

59
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:09,926
We don't have much power.

60
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:16,052
We need a supporter, as well as someone
to keep Grand Prince Hyojang in check.

61
00:08:16,052 --> 00:08:21,511
The Deputy Prime Minister is
neutral, but he needs to play

62
00:08:21,511 --> 00:08:27,926
Grand Prince Hyojang's cards
to be the next Prime Minister.

63
00:08:27,926 --> 00:08:30,636
It's still worth a shot.

64
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:33,428
Do you have a plan?

65
00:08:33,428 --> 00:08:37,261
The Bible teaches us to seek and knock.

66
00:08:37,261 --> 00:08:40,926
The door will open someday, right?

67
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:46,350
Well done.

68
00:08:50,926 --> 00:08:53,372
- I have to hit it to that side, right?
- Correct.

69
00:08:53,372 --> 00:08:55,272
There's not much to it.

70
00:08:55,926 --> 00:08:57,926
I'm good, huh?

71
00:08:57,926 --> 00:09:00,969
You're very good for a beginner.

72
00:09:00,969 --> 00:09:03,926
King Sejong the Great
was good at polo as well.

73
00:09:03,926 --> 00:09:06,926
I hope he becomes like him.

74
00:09:06,926 --> 00:09:12,926
Bear in mind, this is all
thanks to your instructor.

75
00:09:12,926 --> 00:09:14,926
- Yes.
- I don't know about that.

76
00:09:14,926 --> 00:09:21,052
I haven't scored at all since you tutored me.

77
00:09:21,052 --> 00:09:24,719
How many times do I have to tell you?

78
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:29,926
You're not using your wrists!

79
00:09:29,926 --> 00:09:34,469
Shall I try to make up for my
poor scores from last time?

80
00:09:34,469 --> 00:09:37,926
Prince! Care for a game?

81
00:09:37,926 --> 00:09:40,926
Of course I'll win!

82
00:09:40,926 --> 00:09:44,926
I'm betting on the Prince.

83
00:09:44,926 --> 00:09:47,344
Prince, you may begin.

84
00:09:47,344 --> 00:09:49,636
Let's see if you have what it takes.

85
00:09:49,636 --> 00:09:51,886
What?

86
00:09:51,886 --> 00:09:55,553
I didn't know Your Majesty could
talk like that. That's impressive.

87
00:09:55,676 --> 00:09:56,176
Now.

88
00:09:58,683 --> 00:09:59,183
Oh!

89
00:10:00,926 --> 00:10:03,344
Sorry, Attendant Yang.

90
00:10:03,344 --> 00:10:05,010
One more time!

91
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,926
What a bummer!

92
00:10:13,926 --> 00:10:16,926
- "Bummer"?
- That means he's upset.

93
00:10:17,636 --> 00:10:20,926
Prince, I think I won.

94
00:10:20,926 --> 00:10:23,511
No, it's not over yet.

95
00:10:23,511 --> 00:10:25,719
You want to be stubborn?

96
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:28,094
A man's got to be stubborn.

97
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,678
Fine!

98
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:52,257
Nice shot!

99
00:10:57,669 --> 00:10:58,291
Where'd it go?

100
00:11:03,177 --> 00:11:05,553
My ball!

101
00:11:05,553 --> 00:11:07,052
Where'd it go?

102
00:11:07,052 --> 00:11:10,010
Yang Sooneui, find my ball for me.

103
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,926
You should've hit it right the first time.

104
00:11:14,926 --> 00:11:16,926
Hurry up!

105
00:11:19,052 --> 00:11:23,845
Mother, I'd like Prince Youngsung
to have a school buddy.

106
00:11:23,845 --> 00:11:27,594
I don't think he can go through
the Royal Academy by himself.

107
00:11:27,594 --> 00:11:30,926
A school buddy?

108
00:11:30,926 --> 00:11:35,428
But then again, a student was
selected to learn alongside

109
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,678
the prince since the time of
King Taejong the Great.

110
00:11:37,678 --> 00:11:40,926
Do you have anyone in mind?

111
00:11:40,926 --> 00:11:44,761
Yes, just leave it to me.

112
00:11:55,926 --> 00:12:01,344
Have you seen a flower pot that was here?

113
00:12:01,344 --> 00:12:03,428
No.

114
00:12:07,136 --> 00:12:09,761
I took it, Your Highness.

115
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:11,261
Why?

116
00:12:11,261 --> 00:12:12,761
Because it's mine.

117
00:12:12,761 --> 00:12:14,469
What?

118
00:12:14,469 --> 00:12:18,052
I'll get going if you don't
have any work for me.

119
00:12:35,926 --> 00:12:40,010
Your Majesty, Madam Chamberlain is here.

120
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:41,926
Tell her to come in.

121
00:12:51,926 --> 00:12:56,926
How is the funding to build elementary
schools in Africa coming along?

122
00:12:56,926 --> 00:12:58,926
They're having problems...

123
00:12:58,926 --> 00:13:00,926
because a lot of countries
are going through civil wars.

124
00:13:00,926 --> 00:13:02,926
Really?

125
00:13:06,927 --> 00:13:10,926
I want to know what's going on.

126
00:13:10,926 --> 00:13:14,052
I'd like to go there if I can.

127
00:13:14,177 --> 00:13:15,926
You do, Your Majesty?

128
00:13:17,926 --> 00:13:21,136
Look further into it.

129
00:13:21,177 --> 00:13:25,678
What happened with the Deputy Prime Minister?

130
00:13:25,678 --> 00:13:31,261
The Grand Chamberlain has it
under control as you ordered.

131
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,845
- Madam Chamberlain.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

132
00:13:38,845 --> 00:13:45,428
Will the Royal Academy professors
be at the UNICEF bazaar?

133
00:13:45,428 --> 00:13:52,010
Yes, I sent the invitations
as you had ordered.

134
00:13:59,344 --> 00:14:05,926
This is the first time Her Majesty
has personally tried to make allies.

135
00:14:05,926 --> 00:14:13,136
That means she really wants
Prince Yi Hoo to be the Crown Prince.

136
00:14:13,136 --> 00:14:16,926
What do you think?

137
00:14:16,926 --> 00:14:19,386
I have been on good terms with
Grand Prince Hyojang so far

138
00:14:19,386 --> 00:14:24,386
with your and Prince Moonsung's
upcoming engagement.

139
00:14:24,386 --> 00:14:29,926
But, it's hard for me
to say no to Her Majesty.

140
00:14:29,926 --> 00:14:33,926
I didn't expect this to happen.

141
00:14:33,926 --> 00:14:37,469
You shouldn't decline Her Majesty's request.

142
00:14:37,469 --> 00:14:39,094
It's not that simple.

143
00:14:40,926 --> 00:14:49,926
If we're not careful, this could
work to our disadvantage.

144
00:14:49,926 --> 00:14:53,926
I want to see him up close to see
if he's the real thing or not.

145
00:14:56,261 --> 00:14:58,926
Say yes to Her Majesty.

146
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,235
[Prince Hours]

147
00:15:31,094 --> 00:15:32,926
Were you waiting for me?

148
00:15:32,926 --> 00:15:35,926
You became another man's study
buddy right before your engagement.

149
00:15:35,926 --> 00:15:38,177
How absurd.

150
00:15:38,177 --> 00:15:42,261
I don't think we're engaged yet.

151
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:44,261
I don't appreciate your putting it that way.

152
00:15:44,261 --> 00:15:46,511
Is this part of searching for the ace?

153
00:15:46,511 --> 00:15:50,136
No one understands me better than you do.

154
00:15:50,136 --> 00:15:53,136
Show me some results if you want me.

155
00:15:53,136 --> 00:15:56,177
The end justifies the means.

156
00:16:05,302 --> 00:16:07,802
- Hello, Your Highness.
- Shall we?

157
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,117
[The Family Tree]

158
00:16:18,219 --> 00:16:22,219
Reading this makes me more confused.

159
00:16:23,927 --> 00:16:30,428
I've never met my father.

160
00:16:30,927 --> 00:16:33,010
I don't even know who he is.

161
00:16:35,302 --> 00:16:37,511
You can say I'm the exact opposite.

162
00:16:39,219 --> 00:16:43,010
My mother's alive, but I can't see her.

163
00:16:43,094 --> 00:16:47,927
I don't know who she is
or what's on her mind.

164
00:16:48,927 --> 00:16:50,469
Ah, one thing's for sure.

165
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,386
She gave birth to me.

166
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,344
That's for sure.

167
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:02,009
Ahem!

168
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:05,052
Attendant Yang!

169
00:17:15,136 --> 00:17:17,010
This is your dinner menu.

170
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:20,428
Please select which dishes you'd like.

171
00:17:27,052 --> 00:17:29,177
We have stir-fried beef,
seaweed-tendril porridge,

172
00:17:29,177 --> 00:17:31,302
and royal palace glass noodles with
chicken for the traditional Korean meal.

173
00:17:31,469 --> 00:17:34,424
Our western-style meal consists of
homemade cheese and kimchi ravioli,

174
00:17:34,424 --> 00:17:40,610
grilled steak, and an Italian-style
salad with balsamic dressing.

175
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,302
This is so complicated.

176
00:17:44,136 --> 00:17:45,261
What would you like?

177
00:17:46,386 --> 00:17:48,136
I'll go with western-style.

178
00:17:49,094 --> 00:17:52,261
I want the salad without the seafood,

179
00:17:52,261 --> 00:17:55,428
and make sure the soup's not too hot.

180
00:17:56,052 --> 00:17:57,511
Just sprinkle the cheese in the middle.

181
00:17:57,969 --> 00:17:59,261
Make sure the sauce isn't too sweet.

182
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,386
I want my utensils and bowls warm.

183
00:18:03,261 --> 00:18:06,428
Oh, and I'm a light eater,
so cut down the portion-size.

184
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,219
Yes, understood.

185
00:18:10,927 --> 00:18:12,261
Oh, I'm allergic to parsley.

186
00:18:17,261 --> 00:18:18,511
I'd like the same thing.

187
00:18:21,136 --> 00:18:22,136
But with large portions.

188
00:18:31,469 --> 00:18:33,010
A light eater?

189
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:36,302
Yeah, right!

190
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:40,136
Look how chubby you are!

191
00:18:42,219 --> 00:18:44,927
What kind of a name is Saeryung?

192
00:18:46,428 --> 00:18:50,010
Do you even call that a name?

193
00:18:53,386 --> 00:18:56,302
The name Yang Sooneui sounds just as weird.

194
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,052
Your Highness!

195
00:19:04,052 --> 00:19:06,177
Saeryung must've made you upset.

196
00:19:07,136 --> 00:19:08,136
No.

197
00:19:08,386 --> 00:19:10,177
Don't worry. I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

198
00:19:12,469 --> 00:19:14,177
You must've been busy.

199
00:19:14,927 --> 00:19:16,469
You didn't pay much attention to my room.

200
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,052
I'm doing everything that I'm assigned to do.

201
00:19:20,302 --> 00:19:22,177
You must feel uncomfortable around me.

202
00:19:27,136 --> 00:19:31,302
Is it because of what happened that day?

203
00:19:31,428 --> 00:19:34,469
I liked it, but I guess you didn't.

204
00:19:36,136 --> 00:19:38,177
It was thrilling.

205
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,927
A secret rendezvous between us.

206
00:19:48,219 --> 00:19:52,302
Please stop kidding around.

207
00:19:53,969 --> 00:19:58,511
I take pride in my job as an attendant.

208
00:19:58,969 --> 00:20:05,177
So please, no more... I beg you.

209
00:20:07,344 --> 00:20:09,010
Bye.

210
00:20:25,553 --> 00:20:27,428
Did I order consomme?

211
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:28,511
What?

212
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,094
Can I get cream soup instead?

213
00:20:34,302 --> 00:20:36,775
Yes? I'll change it.

214
00:20:42,302 --> 00:20:44,469
Where's the wine for this nice meal?

215
00:20:44,969 --> 00:20:46,511
Care for some wine?

216
00:20:47,969 --> 00:20:48,969
Sure.

217
00:20:53,428 --> 00:20:56,469
Alright.

218
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:03,969
You're supposed to hold this by the stem.

219
00:21:09,177 --> 00:21:11,094
Drink slowly.

220
00:21:17,469 --> 00:21:19,386
I thought I asked you to
leave the parsley out.

221
00:21:20,219 --> 00:21:21,344
What?

222
00:21:24,052 --> 00:21:25,261
Oh, I'm sorry.

223
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:30,386
Attendant Yang isn't feeling well.

224
00:21:31,969 --> 00:21:35,469
I apologize. I will bring a new dish for you.

225
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,094
It's okay.

226
00:21:37,344 --> 00:21:38,511
It's not your fault that
I'm allergic to this.

227
00:21:40,094 --> 00:21:40,969
I'm sorry.

228
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:43,177
It's okay.

229
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,261
Just get me some more coffee.

230
00:21:46,386 --> 00:21:47,261
Will do.

231
00:21:56,136 --> 00:21:57,177
Can I get some more coffee?

232
00:21:57,428 --> 00:21:58,261
Sure.

233
00:22:09,511 --> 00:22:10,428
Are you okay?

234
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,302
You should be more careful.

235
00:22:12,428 --> 00:22:13,469
I'm sorry.

236
00:22:15,177 --> 00:22:16,094
The towel.

237
00:22:18,927 --> 00:22:19,927
Here you go.

238
00:22:20,969 --> 00:22:22,344
You're not a very good server.

239
00:22:22,469 --> 00:22:23,511
Take it away.

240
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:25,094
Okay.

241
00:22:28,469 --> 00:22:29,386
Are you okay?

242
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:30,511
Yes.

243
00:22:31,969 --> 00:22:33,956
Are you okay?

244
00:22:33,956 --> 00:22:36,010
Oh no, you burned your hand.

245
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:36,511
It's okay.

246
00:22:36,511 --> 00:22:37,969
What if you get a scar?

247
00:22:38,511 --> 00:22:39,136
It's okay.

248
00:22:39,219 --> 00:22:40,927
No, it's not.

249
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:43,052
Come with me.

250
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:55,406
Ah...

251
00:22:59,136 --> 00:23:00,052
Let go.

252
00:23:00,428 --> 00:23:01,469
Hold still.

253
00:23:04,094 --> 00:23:05,302
You're such a troublemaker.

254
00:23:08,177 --> 00:23:10,094
You'll get a blister.

255
00:23:12,386 --> 00:23:13,969
I can take care of myself.

256
00:23:14,386 --> 00:23:16,219
And look what happened.

257
00:23:24,052 --> 00:23:26,302
It hurts, doesn't it?

258
00:23:26,428 --> 00:23:27,386
Don't you have to go to a hospital?

259
00:23:33,386 --> 00:23:36,428
Put some ointment on, okay?

260
00:23:40,261 --> 00:23:41,927
It swelled up.

261
00:23:42,386 --> 00:23:44,511
It hurts, doesn't it?

262
00:23:45,302 --> 00:23:46,261
No.

263
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,052
I'm glad you're okay.

264
00:24:37,511 --> 00:24:38,469
Did you get hurt?

265
00:24:49,969 --> 00:24:53,177
It might get worse if you're not careful.

266
00:24:58,511 --> 00:25:00,386
Thank you.

267
00:25:04,261 --> 00:25:07,177
I don't joke around with just anyone.

268
00:25:09,553 --> 00:25:14,969
I was attracted to you since I first met you.

269
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,469
I never intended on making fun of you.

270
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:24,511
I apologize if I offended you.

271
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:32,469
Ah... what should I do
to make you forgive me?

272
00:25:34,177 --> 00:25:35,969
No, Your Highness.

273
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,927
I'm not offended.

274
00:25:39,302 --> 00:25:41,344
Don't worry about it.

275
00:25:44,136 --> 00:25:45,136
Are you sure?

276
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,469
Let me see your hand.

277
00:25:54,712 --> 00:25:57,925
But it's really...

278
00:26:20,177 --> 00:26:21,219
Going home?

279
00:26:22,927 --> 00:26:23,969
Yes.

280
00:26:26,511 --> 00:26:28,261
How's your hand?

281
00:26:29,969 --> 00:26:31,386
You have it wrapped up.

282
00:26:33,469 --> 00:26:35,219
Yeah.

283
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,469
Since when did you two become friends?

284
00:26:40,302 --> 00:26:42,094
I mean Prince Moonsung.

285
00:26:42,511 --> 00:26:45,052
We're not friends.

286
00:26:45,177 --> 00:26:46,969
It's not like that.

287
00:26:47,344 --> 00:26:48,511
Bye.

288
00:26:52,136 --> 00:26:53,261
Are you still mad?

289
00:26:56,052 --> 00:27:01,177
I don't know what I did wrong
when I got drunk, but don't be.

290
00:27:02,386 --> 00:27:03,511
I won't do it again.

291
00:27:04,969 --> 00:27:05,511
I'm sorry.

292
00:27:06,469 --> 00:27:09,469
You don't even remember
what you're sorry about.

293
00:27:10,927 --> 00:27:11,969
Forget it.

294
00:27:14,428 --> 00:27:15,469
Yang Sooneui!

295
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:17,927
Yang Sooneui!

296
00:27:29,261 --> 00:27:32,052
A man and a woman can't be friends.

297
00:27:32,136 --> 00:27:34,386
They'll just end up as lovers like them.

298
00:27:34,482 --> 00:27:37,758
Your friend becomes "babe,"
then "dear," and then "Daddy."

299
00:27:37,758 --> 00:27:39,927
Don't you agree?

300
00:27:45,428 --> 00:27:46,511
Aren't you going to watch this?

301
00:27:47,177 --> 00:27:48,094
No.

302
00:28:51,261 --> 00:28:54,136
"Saints do not move."

303
00:28:54,261 --> 00:28:55,219
Hey!

304
00:28:55,511 --> 00:28:57,302
Put some emotion into it!

305
00:28:58,927 --> 00:28:59,969
Do it right.

306
00:29:00,386 --> 00:29:04,010
You're the one who can't focus!

307
00:29:04,511 --> 00:29:05,927
I don't want to do it!

308
00:29:06,386 --> 00:29:09,052
Hoo! You try.

309
00:29:11,094 --> 00:29:12,511
I don't feel like it.

310
00:29:15,177 --> 00:29:17,052
Start from here.

311
00:29:18,261 --> 00:29:19,511
Geez...

312
00:29:24,052 --> 00:29:26,219
"O, then, dear saint."

313
00:29:29,511 --> 00:29:30,094
Oops.

314
00:29:30,219 --> 00:29:34,010
"Saints do not move, though
grant for prayers' sake."

315
00:29:36,136 --> 00:29:41,093
Then move not, while my
prayer's effect I take.

316
00:29:59,261 --> 00:30:01,219
I must've been crazy.

317
00:30:01,386 --> 00:30:03,511
How can I forget something like that?

318
00:30:05,177 --> 00:30:07,136
How am I going to face Yang Sooneui now?

319
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,094
I have something to tell you.

320
00:30:26,969 --> 00:30:29,511
Attendant Yang and I have to go.

321
00:30:30,136 --> 00:30:31,969
You can talk about it later.

322
00:30:32,511 --> 00:30:33,511
Let's go.

323
00:31:00,969 --> 00:31:03,511
What do you want me to do?

324
00:31:05,261 --> 00:31:08,094
You'll find out when we get there.

325
00:31:35,302 --> 00:31:38,052
Are you mocking me again?

326
00:31:38,969 --> 00:31:44,428
A residential attendant is supposed
to aid me in everything, right?

327
00:32:55,136 --> 00:32:56,302
Smells good.

328
00:34:07,219 --> 00:34:09,553
How's Joon doing?

329
00:34:10,302 --> 00:34:12,094
Is he getting along with Saeryung?

330
00:34:13,177 --> 00:34:17,969
As usual, he's getting along
well with Miss Saeryung.

331
00:34:18,511 --> 00:34:20,386
Good.

332
00:34:20,927 --> 00:34:24,261
I was worried he might make a mistake
since he's still young after all.

333
00:34:25,344 --> 00:34:26,927
Nothing's wrong, right?

334
00:34:28,052 --> 00:34:29,511
Right, Grand Prince.

335
00:34:32,302 --> 00:34:34,469
Don't worry.

336
00:34:35,386 --> 00:34:38,344
You can't find a better man than Joon.

337
00:35:24,177 --> 00:35:25,469
Are you going to play?

338
00:35:25,969 --> 00:35:27,052
Of course.

339
00:35:30,386 --> 00:35:32,927
I don't think you're ready
to play while on a horse.

340
00:35:33,344 --> 00:35:35,177
We'll see about that.

341
00:36:25,052 --> 00:36:26,010
Hoo!

342
00:36:26,136 --> 00:36:27,136
Are you okay?

343
00:36:30,219 --> 00:36:31,344
Did you get hurt?

344
00:36:36,177 --> 00:36:37,177
I'm okay.

345
00:36:37,386 --> 00:36:40,302
I told you you're not ready yet.

346
00:36:55,969 --> 00:36:56,969
He fell off a horse.

347
00:36:58,428 --> 00:37:00,010
What? He did?

348
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:02,261
Did he get hurt?

349
00:37:02,469 --> 00:37:03,386
I don't know.

350
00:37:04,094 --> 00:37:07,511
I'm sure he did. Poor thing.

351
00:37:24,052 --> 00:37:26,927
We'll soon be in-laws.

352
00:37:27,094 --> 00:37:29,600
I think we've been too formal until now.

353
00:37:29,963 --> 00:37:32,194
Let's have a shot, shall we?

354
00:37:40,927 --> 00:37:46,010
It'll be a good idea to experience palace
life beforehand as a school buddy.

355
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:51,969
Saeryung likes studying.

356
00:37:53,094 --> 00:37:57,261
We should get them engaged before
she becomes even busier.

357
00:37:59,469 --> 00:38:04,469
My wife's still in New York.

358
00:38:05,177 --> 00:38:09,219
So, why don't we postpone the engagement?

359
00:38:15,302 --> 00:38:25,052
The neighborhoods are completely different
before and after crossing a bridge.

360
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:29,219
My wife picked a good date to get engaged.

361
00:38:29,302 --> 00:38:32,969
Let's just do it then.

362
00:38:46,969 --> 00:38:49,094
We have a problem.

363
00:38:50,136 --> 00:38:54,302
I can't turn my back on
Grand Prince Hyojang either.

364
00:38:55,302 --> 00:38:56,469
Let's go with it for now.

365
00:38:57,511 --> 00:38:59,136
For now?

366
00:39:00,219 --> 00:39:02,428
Remember what you told me?

367
00:39:02,969 --> 00:39:06,261
You sometimes need to bend the rules.

368
00:39:08,344 --> 00:39:09,969
I'll take care of it.

369
00:39:20,469 --> 00:39:28,010
Yes, Mother.

370
00:39:32,969 --> 00:39:34,386
Are you finally getting engaged?

371
00:39:35,511 --> 00:39:37,052
Congratulations.

372
00:39:41,261 --> 00:39:44,302
Why don't you just get on with it?

373
00:39:44,428 --> 00:39:49,136
Saeryung can help you become
the Crown Prince.

374
00:39:51,219 --> 00:39:53,386
We have what each other needs.

375
00:39:54,177 --> 00:39:55,927
Why do you say that?

376
00:39:56,177 --> 00:39:57,344
I don't know.

377
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:02,261
Something doesn't feel right.

378
00:40:07,969 --> 00:40:09,094
He'll be here soon.

379
00:40:09,261 --> 00:40:10,344
Please wait here.

380
00:40:11,302 --> 00:40:12,927
Thank you.

381
00:40:36,094 --> 00:40:37,469
Attendant Yang.

382
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:42,052
I'd like to invite you to my birthday party.

383
00:40:42,469 --> 00:40:46,428
You've been nice to me whenever I'm here.

384
00:40:46,927 --> 00:40:48,386
The two Princes will be there, too.

385
00:40:48,511 --> 00:40:49,511
Join us.

386
00:40:52,469 --> 00:40:55,927
Thanks, but I...

387
00:40:56,302 --> 00:40:59,219
My chamberlain will give you the details.

388
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:01,010
I'll be waiting.

389
00:41:18,219 --> 00:41:19,177
Saeryung.

390
00:41:23,136 --> 00:41:24,927
We need to talk.

391
00:41:25,969 --> 00:41:28,010
I'm busy because of the party.

392
00:41:28,344 --> 00:41:31,094
Let's talk about it later.

393
00:41:31,428 --> 00:41:33,428
Remember to come to the party.

394
00:41:33,511 --> 00:41:36,219
It'll be weird if my fiance doesn't show up.

395
00:41:36,344 --> 00:41:37,052
Saeryung.

396
00:41:37,177 --> 00:41:39,428
Oh, and I invited Attendant Yang.

397
00:41:39,927 --> 00:41:41,094
Attendant Yang?

398
00:41:41,469 --> 00:41:43,344
She's your residential attendant.

399
00:41:43,428 --> 00:41:44,511
I want to get to know her.

400
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:46,469
For the future, too.

401
00:41:59,333 --> 00:41:59,833
Oh!

402
00:42:07,136 --> 00:42:08,052
Look!

403
00:42:13,386 --> 00:42:15,428
Please come to the party.

404
00:42:15,969 --> 00:42:17,219
I'll be waiting for you.

405
00:42:18,219 --> 00:42:20,219
This must be from your fairy godmother.

406
00:42:20,344 --> 00:42:21,386
Wow!

407
00:42:23,386 --> 00:42:28,927
You should definitely go.

408
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:35,687
[Prince Hours]

409
00:43:37,219 --> 00:43:39,052
Are there a lot of parties like this?

410
00:43:39,428 --> 00:43:41,428
I guess you can say that.

411
00:43:49,283 --> 00:43:51,969
- Oooh!
- So pretty!

412
00:43:51,969 --> 00:43:54,219
- Congrats!
- Thanks.

413
00:43:55,261 --> 00:43:56,927
Wow!

414
00:44:00,527 --> 00:44:03,934
Woooo!

415
00:44:09,052 --> 00:44:10,969
Wow! Who's this pretty girl?

416
00:44:34,302 --> 00:44:35,511
Welcome.

417
00:44:59,261 --> 00:45:01,010
How do you know Saeryung?

418
00:45:02,094 --> 00:45:03,794
Pardon?

419
00:45:04,094 --> 00:45:05,219
What perfume do you use?

420
00:45:05,511 --> 00:45:06,969
It smells nice.

421
00:45:14,136 --> 00:45:15,261
Take your hands off me.

422
00:45:20,136 --> 00:45:24,219
How come you didn't tell
me that you were coming?

423
00:45:26,219 --> 00:45:28,344
Because I didn't plan on coming.

424
00:45:29,302 --> 00:45:32,219
Besides, I don't have to tell you everything.

425
00:45:32,428 --> 00:45:34,010
What?

426
00:45:36,052 --> 00:45:37,177
Fine then.

427
00:45:38,177 --> 00:45:39,386
What's wrong with your dress?

428
00:45:41,136 --> 00:45:42,261
It's too sexy.

429
00:45:43,302 --> 00:45:45,010
All the guys are staring at you.

430
00:45:48,386 --> 00:45:49,261
What?

431
00:45:50,469 --> 00:45:53,136
Is that all you can say?

432
00:45:54,136 --> 00:45:56,969
Why do you care about how I dress?

433
00:45:57,052 --> 00:45:58,219
That's my problem.

434
00:45:58,302 --> 00:46:00,094
I don't like it when guys stare at you!

435
00:46:00,219 --> 00:46:02,094
That's none of your...

436
00:46:06,052 --> 00:46:06,969
What?

437
00:46:08,052 --> 00:46:11,927
What did you just say?

438
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:16,177
What I mean is...

439
00:46:18,219 --> 00:46:21,010
Don't wear something so revealing
if you don't even have a nice body!

440
00:46:21,428 --> 00:46:22,969
You look awful!

441
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:32,556
What? What did you just say?

442
00:46:38,136 --> 00:46:39,219
Hey!

443
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:44,136
Happy birthday.

444
00:46:46,469 --> 00:46:48,511
Here you go.

445
00:46:59,052 --> 00:47:02,010
It's a doll that I made.

446
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:06,511
If you sleep next to it,
you'll be eased from your worries.

447
00:47:08,344 --> 00:47:09,386
Really?

448
00:47:10,094 --> 00:47:11,261
Thanks.

449
00:47:21,428 --> 00:47:26,428
I think this dress is too expensive
for me to keep as a gift.

450
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,511
I'll give it back to you.

451
00:47:54,927 --> 00:47:58,136
Did you send her the dress?

452
00:48:02,302 --> 00:48:03,386
Yes.

453
00:48:06,219 --> 00:48:11,094
You got a dress for another girl to
wear at your fiancee's birthday party?

454
00:48:12,553 --> 00:48:15,969
If you need a toy, find a more suitable girl.

455
00:48:16,219 --> 00:48:17,302
I never regarded her as a toy.

456
00:48:19,052 --> 00:48:21,052
You mean you like her?

457
00:48:21,261 --> 00:48:22,219
Saeryung.

458
00:48:23,428 --> 00:48:30,094
In order to marry someone, you need to like
that person sincerely in your heart.

459
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,386
Heart?

460
00:48:34,927 --> 00:48:35,927
Is that important?

461
00:48:37,428 --> 00:48:40,386
Fine, I'll tell you what you want to hear.

462
00:48:41,469 --> 00:48:43,010
I like you.

463
00:48:43,969 --> 00:48:46,261
I liked you ever since we
were little, and I still do.

464
00:48:47,261 --> 00:48:48,302
Satisfied?

465
00:48:52,219 --> 00:48:53,219
Stop it!

466
00:48:57,219 --> 00:48:59,927
Joon, what I mean is...

467
00:49:00,219 --> 00:49:01,302
Now you know?

468
00:49:01,511 --> 00:49:02,969
That it was a lie.

469
00:49:08,386 --> 00:49:17,094
I thought we didn't have to listen to
our hearts, but I think we were wrong.

470
00:49:17,219 --> 00:49:19,136
You should look for your heart, too.

471
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:46,177
What are you doing here?

472
00:49:54,052 --> 00:49:55,428
You must be bored.

473
00:50:00,344 --> 00:50:02,219
That dress looks good on you.

474
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:09,469
If you're bored, why don't we go home?

475
00:50:25,969 --> 00:50:27,344
Miss Saeryung.

476
00:50:32,428 --> 00:50:33,428
What's wrong?

477
00:51:23,898 --> 00:51:32,242
[The Prince in the Palace]

478
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:39,381
[Prince Hours]

479
00:54:39,381 --> 00:54:40,838
Be gentle!

480
00:54:40,958 --> 00:54:43,265
If you talk while I'm applying
this, you'll get wrinkles.

481
00:54:43,265 --> 00:54:46,837
Hey! What... Hey!

482
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,856
A personal grudge?

483
00:54:50,193 --> 00:54:51,900
Investigate them all!

484
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,258
Even Grand Prince Hyojang's
house is not an exception.

485
00:54:55,049 --> 00:54:57,791
It's time to draw our swords.

486
00:55:01,675 --> 00:55:04,332
Wake up!

487
00:55:04,332 --> 00:55:06,320
I knew you were already awake.

488
00:55:08,264 --> 00:55:10,643
About... earlier...

489
00:55:10,643 --> 00:55:13,712
If you have nothing else
for me, I'll get going.

490
00:55:16,013 --> 00:55:18,783
You're going to take part in the game then?

491
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:21,301
I'll no longer stand at
the sidelines and watch.

492
00:55:29,126 --> 00:55:30,741
Long time no see.

493
00:55:35,369 --> 00:55:37,037
We're ready.

494
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:39,398
Mr. Cho!

495
00:55:41,497 --> 00:55:43,048
Excuse me.

496
00:55:51,879 --> 00:55:52,379
Stand by.

497
00:55:56,754 --> 00:55:57,850
No!

498
00:55:57,850 --> 00:55:58,350
Hit!
