and cousin of the late Emperor Ikjo.

Thus, you are now the heir apparent
to succeed Her Majesty the Empress.

00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:42,504
Your father was my older twin brother.

knowing of your existence.

00:29:06,004 --> 00:29:09,669
I always wondered how my father looked.

310
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:11,920
So, this is what he looked like.

311
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:19,045
Since he didn't know I was born,
he probably didn't miss me.

Forgive me, Your Highness.

313
00:29:22,254 --> 00:29:28,669
The Grand Prince has ordered
me to find your mother..

314

But, she asked me not to
disclose your identity.

315
00:29:34,669 --> 00:29:36,669
I don't understand.

316
00:29:36,669 --> 00:29:38,962
Why would Mom hide me?

317
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:50,669
She wanted you to be free from
the pressures of being royalty.

318
00:29:52,045 --> 00:29:58,669
Try to understand your mother's
effort to protect you.

319
00:29:59,669 --> 00:30:02,669
So that's why she avoided
people all her life.

320
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:07,004
It must've been tough for Mom.

321
00:30:07,004 --> 00:30:12,712
But, she wanted to send you to
the palace after you turned twenty.

323
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,669
Forgive me for telling you this now.

324
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:28,669
Before your mother died, she had
asked me to disclose your identity

325
00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:32,669
after you turned twenty when you
could make your own decisions.

But, you can depend on Grand Prince
Hyosung as if he is your father.

World Cup, she suddenly...

344
00:35:01,753 --> 00:35:08,669
I was young back then, but I
vividly remember how she looked.

345
00:35:08,669 --> 00:35:14,171
She was very dignified,
and had a beautiful smile.

346
00:35:25,879 --> 00:35:30,669
Your Majesty, this was
Grand Prince Hyoin's ring.

Prince Hoo, I'd like to see your ring.

348
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,753
Do you know what that writing means?

349
00:36:18,669 --> 00:36:21,669
No, not really.

350
00:36:23,753 --> 00:36:31,962
It means, "Let's think of each
other whenever the wind blows."

351
00:36:31,962 --> 00:36:42,669
Those are the royal wedding rings shared by
your father, Grand Prince Hyoin, and mother.

352
00:36:44,837 --> 00:36:51,087
Now that you've proven your lineage,
you must live as a royal from now on.

353

354

What is it?

356
00:36:58,669 --> 00:37:02,962
What does it mean to live as a royal?

357
00:37:02,962 --> 00:37:09,669
It's only right for a person to be
curious about his own identity.

358
00:37:09,669 --> 00:37:16,087
But in life, there are some answers
that cannot be obtained easily.

359
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:22,669
I have another question.

360
00:37:22,669 --> 00:37:25,837
Some people attacked me during the day.

361
00:37:29,669 --> 00:37:33,669
I was shocked to hear that as well.

362
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:41,669
I can't say at this point
because I only have a guess.

363
00:37:41,669 --> 00:37:44,962

364
00:37:51,254 --> 00:37:53,669

00:37:58,669 --> 00:38:00,669
Boyfriend, did you order black-bean noodles?

367
00:38:02,669 --> 00:38:05,669
Kang Hoo, you rat!

368
00:38:05,669 --> 00:38:08,669
Stop running away from me! I'll take you on!

369
00:38:08,669 --> 00:38:12,669
Hey, I'm busy. Talk to you later.

370
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,504
I heard that you practice martial arts.

371
00:38:19,504 --> 00:38:23,712
Well, I'm just the best fighter
in my neighborhood.

372
00:38:23,712 --> 00:38:27,045
I'm well known in the Incheon pier area, too.

373
00:38:31,293 --> 00:38:32,965
Boyfriend, did you order black-bean noodles?

374
00:38:33,962 --> 00:38:35,254
I'll talk to you later!

375
00:38:35,254 --> 00:38:38,669
How dare you hang up on me!

376
00:38:38,669 --> 00:38:39,795
What'd you hang up on me for?

377
00:38:39,795 --> 00:38:42,421
- Do you want to die?
- I'm calling again after you hung up on me!

378
00:38:44,379 --> 00:38:46,669
Die alone.

379
00:38:46,669 --> 00:38:48,669
Why, you little...

380
00:38:50,669 --> 00:38:53,462
I'm a little popular.

381
00:38:54,837 --> 00:38:56,669
Listen, Prince.

382
00:38:59,753 --> 00:39:04,669
You should put your busy street life

383
00:39:04,669 --> 00:39:09,669
behind you and learn the
etiquette fit for royalty.

384
00:39:09,669 --> 00:39:11,669
Do you understand?

385
00:39:14,629 --> 00:39:15,669
Yes.

386
00:39:34,879 --> 00:39:39,087
Goodnight, Your Highness.

387
00:39:57,669 --> 00:39:59,669
Hoo.

388
00:39:59,669 --> 00:40:10,669
You'll one day choose between the life
you want and the life you have to live.

389
00:40:10,669 --> 00:40:19,212
The important thing is to take the
road you choose for yourself.

390
00:40:19,212 --> 00:40:25,045
That road will sometimes be
dark, scary, and hurtful.

391
00:40:26,045 --> 00:40:32,669
But you can find your way
if you don't lose courage.

392
00:40:32,669 --> 00:40:38,712
Courage means taking action
despite your fears.

393
00:40:40,669 --> 00:40:45,629
Hoo, keep this necklace with you.

394
00:40:45,629 --> 00:40:49,669
If you do, I'll always be with you.

395
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:31,962
Chuba?

396
00:41:31,962 --> 00:41:34,045
Hi, Hoo.

397
00:41:34,045 --> 00:41:35,669
You're alive.

398
00:41:35,669 --> 00:41:38,004
Where are you?

399
00:41:38,004 --> 00:41:39,879
The palace.

400
00:41:39,879 --> 00:41:42,129
We're in front of The Palace right now.

401
00:41:42,129 --> 00:41:44,669
Open up.

402
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,712
What? The other palace?

403
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:50,712
Is he working for someone else now?

404
00:41:51,669 --> 00:41:53,879
I think he has a head injury.

405
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,669
He says it's the palace
where the Empress lives.

406
00:41:56,669 --> 00:41:58,669
That's Gyeongbok Palace.

407
00:41:58,669 --> 00:42:04,171
There's a new Korean restaurant
called Gyeongbok Palace.

408
00:42:04,254 --> 00:42:05,920
Are you working for a Korean restaurant now?

409
00:42:05,962 --> 00:42:07,669
What happened with Mr. Cho?

410
00:42:08,962 --> 00:42:11,669
Don't yell!

411
00:42:11,669 --> 00:42:14,669
Bulbam is pissed off at you!

412
00:42:17,504 --> 00:42:22,669
I think he's onto something.
I don't like the look of this.

413
00:42:22,669 --> 00:42:25,669
I can't go!

414
00:42:25,669 --> 00:42:31,962
Tell Bulbam to shove it.

415
00:42:31,962 --> 00:42:35,669
I'll call you later.

416
00:42:35,669 --> 00:42:37,087
Idiots.

417
00:43:24,254 --> 00:43:27,129
Your Highness, Her Majesty,
the Empress Dowager is here.

418
00:43:28,753 --> 00:43:30,669
The Empress Dowager?

419
00:43:43,669 --> 00:43:45,669
Tell him again.

420
00:43:47,421 --> 00:43:52,669
Your Highness, Her Majesty
the Empress Dowager is here.

421
00:43:56,669 --> 00:43:58,254
Your Highness...

422
00:43:59,504 --> 00:44:00,669
Come in!

423
00:44:39,669 --> 00:44:45,669
Your eyes and nose look exactly
like those of your father's.

424
00:44:45,669 --> 00:44:52,669
I'm glad to see that you've grown
into a fine, young man.

425
00:44:52,669 --> 00:44:57,171
Your father would have
been so happy to see you.

426
00:44:57,171 --> 00:44:59,669
You're very beautiful, too.

427
00:44:59,669 --> 00:45:01,879
Thank you for seeing me that way.

428
00:45:03,669 --> 00:45:08,669
I used to be an aspiring actress.

429
00:45:08,669 --> 00:45:14,920
I've withered with age,
but I used to be pretty.

430
00:45:16,669 --> 00:45:19,421
Wow! What movies were you in?

431
00:45:21,753 --> 00:45:24,712
Ah, I did theater work.

432
00:45:26,837 --> 00:45:29,212
It's been a long time.

433
00:45:32,669 --> 00:45:36,669
It won't be easy to adjust to palace life.

434
00:45:36,669 --> 00:45:39,669
Talk to me if you need help.

435
00:45:39,669 --> 00:45:42,670
I'll do my best to help.

436
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:44,669
Thank you.

437
00:45:46,669 --> 00:45:48,669
Enjoy your time.

438
00:46:09,879 --> 00:46:12,669
Why is the chicken so black?

439
00:46:13,879 --> 00:46:15,669
Maybe it's tanned.

440
00:46:26,962 --> 00:46:30,669
I'm so happy today.

441
00:46:30,669 --> 00:46:33,669
We should do this more often.

442
00:46:33,669 --> 00:46:35,379
I'm honored.

443
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:39,669
Do you like the food?

444
00:46:39,669 --> 00:46:42,337
It's very delicious.

445
00:46:42,337 --> 00:46:43,669
Enjoy.

446
00:46:48,462 --> 00:46:53,669
I'd like to take Prince Hoo to
the Royal Academy's event.

447
00:46:56,629 --> 00:47:00,920
Empress, I think you're going too fast.

448
00:47:01,004 --> 00:47:09,504
Time may shake the tree,
but the root is still there.

449
00:47:09,504 --> 00:47:14,629
The wind may shake its branches
and the weather color the leaves...

450
00:47:14,629 --> 00:47:17,879
but they can't affect the root.

451
00:47:17,879 --> 00:47:25,212
Remember how our ancestors pursued
deeply-rooted trees and water from deep springs.

452
00:47:25,212 --> 00:47:31,212
I will, if that'll stop Grand Prince Hyojang.

453
00:47:31,212 --> 00:47:36,129
But they tried to kidnap the young prince!

454
00:47:36,129 --> 00:47:39,669
This is a serious matter.

455
00:47:39,669 --> 00:47:44,962
All the royal family elders and
the officers will be there today.

456
00:47:46,753 --> 00:47:52,753
I'd like them to know that I want
Prince Hoo to be the Crown Prince.

457
00:48:11,962 --> 00:48:16,254
There are too many side dishes.

458
00:48:16,254 --> 00:48:18,920
Would you like some?

459
00:48:22,669 --> 00:48:25,669
Please get me a bigger bowl.

460
00:48:29,045 --> 00:48:30,669
Why not?

461
00:48:30,669 --> 00:48:33,669
Let's enjoy a treat.

462
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:52,561
[Prince Hours]

463
00:48:52,588 --> 00:49:04,669
Why don't you skip the convention hosted
by the Royal Academy since you're busy?

464
00:49:04,669 --> 00:49:06,795
Is it the same program?

465
00:49:06,837 --> 00:49:16,669
Pretty much, except for
the 24 Martial Arts demonstration.

466
00:49:16,669 --> 00:49:18,712
24 Martial Arts?

467
00:49:20,837 --> 00:49:29,045
The students of 24 Martial Arts
will give a demonstration.

468
00:49:30,669 --> 00:49:33,546
That'll be good for the Prince.

469
00:49:33,546 --> 00:49:36,795
I'll go with the Prince if I can make it.

470
00:49:36,795 --> 00:49:45,669
You need to visit the late Royal
Museum Curator's mortuary.

471
00:49:45,669 --> 00:49:49,669
So it'll be difficult to
attend the demonstration.

472
00:49:49,669 --> 00:49:51,045
Really?

473
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:02,920
Still, get the Prince ready so I can
introduce him at the convention.

474
00:50:02,962 --> 00:50:08,421
Yes, Your Majesty.

475
00:50:30,379 --> 00:50:39,171
Put your chin in, and don't
stick out your behind.

476
00:50:44,669 --> 00:50:47,421
Straighten your back.

477
00:50:49,669 --> 00:50:51,669
Can you do this?

478
00:50:55,379 --> 00:50:57,669
Put your left hand down.

479
00:50:57,669 --> 00:51:00,669
Don't hold too tightly.

480
00:51:04,712 --> 00:51:06,669
Try the wine.

481
00:51:08,669 --> 00:51:10,669
Hold the stem.

482
00:51:14,669 --> 00:51:20,669
You should savor the taste and drink slowly.

483
00:51:20,669 --> 00:51:23,669
A man's got to drink it in one go.

484
00:51:28,546 --> 00:51:29,669
One more glass.

485
00:51:37,669 --> 00:51:39,669
We're done.

486
00:51:44,669 --> 00:51:46,669
Try the suit on.

487
00:51:58,669 --> 00:52:02,669
Sooneui! Did you bring the candle holder?

488
00:52:02,669 --> 00:52:04,669
Oh, I forgot!

489
00:52:04,669 --> 00:52:07,171
I'm so stupid. I always forget!

490
00:52:08,004 --> 00:52:08,737
What?

491
00:52:10,454 --> 00:52:10,954
Over there!

492
00:52:11,436 --> 00:52:12,475
Attendant Yang!

493
00:52:12,837 --> 00:52:15,669
What are you doing?

494
00:52:31,669 --> 00:52:36,795
I'm so excited to see my sweetheart.

495
00:52:36,795 --> 00:52:39,421
Who's that?

496
00:52:39,421 --> 00:52:41,669
My darling Joon.

497
00:52:41,669 --> 00:52:44,879
My lover... Joon!

498
00:52:44,879 --> 00:52:46,879
Joon!

499
00:52:46,879 --> 00:52:48,669
What kind of a name is that?

500
00:52:48,669 --> 00:52:53,045
Why am I wasting my time talking to you?
You're so far off from being romantic!

501
00:52:54,669 --> 00:52:57,670
Prince Moonsung!

502
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:59,669
Oh, I see.

503
00:53:00,669 --> 00:53:04,129
He's charismatic with a perfect voice.

504
00:53:04,129 --> 00:53:10,004
He has a perfect bodyline
with firm, sexy thighs.

505
00:53:14,045 --> 00:53:18,879
But, my sweetheart is getting engaged.

506
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:22,669
How do you know?

507
00:53:22,669 --> 00:53:28,004
I'm Ma Yongnam, the gossip queen.

508
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:32,920
It's not officially announced yet,
but I have my ways.

509
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:35,669
With whom?

510
00:53:35,669 --> 00:53:37,004
Her name is Shin Saeryung.

511
00:53:37,004 --> 00:53:41,421
She's got perfection written all over her.

512
00:53:42,837 --> 00:53:46,669
She's pretty, rich, and from
a prominent family.

513
00:53:46,669 --> 00:53:50,296
And, to top it off, she's rude!

514
00:53:50,337 --> 00:53:51,795
Shin Saeryung?

515
00:56:06,421 --> 00:56:08,669
Yes, Your Excellency?

516
00:56:08,669 --> 00:56:10,669
Is that him?

517
00:56:12,712 --> 00:56:16,171
Yes, it is.

518
00:56:16,171 --> 00:56:22,669
I didn't know she'd bring her tame
rabbit to the hunting ground so fast.

519
00:56:22,669 --> 00:56:29,795
The wise Empress is too busy thinking
about making the first move to know...

520
00:56:29,795 --> 00:56:33,669
what the hunters are up to.

521
00:56:34,712 --> 00:56:36,171
What should we do?

522
00:56:38,171 --> 00:56:42,669
Now that the bait is here, let's see.

523
00:56:42,669 --> 00:56:47,837
It's up to the hunter to decide
when to start hunting.

524
00:59:31,087 --> 00:59:32,669
Who is she?

525
00:59:34,462 --> 00:59:35,669
You were great!

526
00:59:35,669 --> 00:59:37,669
You were awesome!

527
00:59:37,669 --> 00:59:38,879
I was so nervous.

528
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:40,669
You did a good job!

529
00:59:40,669 --> 00:59:41,770
I'll go and change.

530
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:43,048
Okay.

531
00:59:56,358 --> 00:59:57,703
I'm sorry.

532
00:59:58,045 --> 01:00:02,740
The sword-dancing lady just passed by.

533
01:00:03,212 --> 01:00:05,879
Have you seen her?

534
01:00:07,669 --> 01:00:12,669
I'm sorry. I haven't seen her.

535
01:00:26,045 --> 01:00:27,669
Are you...

536
01:00:27,669 --> 01:00:29,588
Are you...

537
01:00:29,588 --> 01:00:31,669
From Daeyeon Elementary School?

538
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:33,670
Sixth grade, Classroom 6?

539
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:37,669
Oh? Kang Hoo?

540
01:01:34,523 --> 01:01:35,323
[Prince Hours]

541
01:01:35,323 --> 01:01:39,053
A Chinese-food delivery
boy becoming a prince?

542
01:01:39,053 --> 01:01:42,044
There's no way that arrogant
narcissist is a prince!

543
01:01:42,044 --> 01:01:44,064
By the way, do you know him?

544
01:01:44,064 --> 01:01:46,054
You did the martial arts
demonstration earlier, right?

545
01:01:46,054 --> 01:01:48,058
You were really cool.

546
01:01:48,058 --> 01:01:51,792
But, that sword dance you did...
why did you do it like that?

547
01:01:51,792 --> 01:01:52,972
It was a pleasure to meet you.

548
01:01:52,972 --> 01:01:55,040
Long time no see.

549
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:57,361
But, what are you doing here?

550
01:01:57,361 --> 01:02:01,106
I successfully passed the royal exam
to become a court lady.

551
01:02:01,106 --> 01:02:03,953
So, you're a maid like in
those historical dramas, right?

552
01:02:03,953 --> 01:02:08,682
Starting today, you'll be
taught the required etiquette

553
01:02:08,682 --> 01:02:13,410
and knowledge necessary
to live a life of royalty.

554
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:14,800
- Oh, Yang Soon!

555
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,189
I am Court Lady Yang, Your Highness.

556
01:02:16,189 --> 01:02:17,996
Quit playing! Hey!

557
01:02:17,996 --> 01:02:23,039
What? Please don't "Hey" me! Your Highness...

558
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:23,842
Can I borrow your cell phone?

559
01:02:23,842 --> 01:02:24,429
Forget it.

560
01:02:24,429 --> 01:02:26,412
Give it to me!

561
01:02:27,132 --> 01:02:30,291
You're flat-chested,
so I didn't feel a thing!

562
01:02:30,291 --> 01:02:36,272
We can't crown someone who's not fit
just because he's of royal blood.

563
01:02:36,272 --> 01:02:40,392
An unexpected threat has arisen,
yet you don't look nervous at all.

564
01:02:40,392 --> 01:02:43,432
Education, sincerity, and dignity.
Of those three,

565
01:02:43,432 --> 01:02:46,473
I think dignity is what makes
royalty seem like royalty.

566
01:02:46,473 --> 01:02:48,479
You don't seem to like him much. Why is that?

567
01:02:51,419 --> 01:02:52,725
If you like me, just say so.

568
01:02:52,725 --> 01:02:56,293
Ladies and gentlemen, please rise.

569
01:02:56,976 --> 01:02:58,827
Her Majesty the Empress has arrived!

570
01:02:59,257 --> 01:03:02,035
I'm going to introduce to you someone
who's going to surprise you all.

571
01:03:02,447 --> 01:03:03,567
I'm pleased to make your acquaintance.

572
01:03:03,567 --> 01:03:06,323
My name is Yi Hoo.
