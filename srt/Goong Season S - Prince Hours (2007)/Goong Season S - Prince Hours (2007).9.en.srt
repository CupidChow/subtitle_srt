But, Your Highness... if Lady Han
finds out about this, I'm dead.

4
00:00:50,712 --> 00:00:52,169
Are you sure you have to go?

5
00:00:52,169 --> 00:00:56,088
It'll only take a minute.
Nothing will go wrong.

You...

11
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,462
What are you doing here?

12
00:02:21,462 --> 00:02:25,295
Huh? So, this is where you live.

13
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:30,212
You're not here to see me, are you?

14
00:02:30,253 --> 00:02:33,796
Did you come alone?
How did you know I lived here?

15
00:02:33,796 --> 00:02:35,462
I have my ways.

16
00:02:35,462 --> 00:02:39,169
What's the matter?

17
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:41,462
Nothing.

18
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:43,671
Maybe it's because I didn't
get to see you today.

19
00:02:43,671 --> 00:02:45,420
I felt awkward today.

20
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,129
Did you feel the same?

21
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:49,169
Why should I?

22
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,545
I felt so relieved because
I didn't see you today.

23
00:02:51,545 --> 00:02:55,587
Then, why the long face?

24
00:02:55,587 --> 00:02:59,712
What about my face?

25
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:04,004
Nothing. Anyway, how's everything?

26
00:03:04,004 --> 00:03:10,169
Fine, I guess. Is that all?

27
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:12,169

always get you into trouble.

32
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:37,088
I'm glad you know.
You should leave me alone then.

33
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,462
Is that what you want me to do?

34

Good morning, Your Highness.

00:07:23,253 --> 00:07:27,462
Here are your morning papers.

65
00:07:27,462 --> 00:07:30,169

66
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:32,587
Huh?

67
00:07:32,587 --> 00:07:37,169
No, not really.

68
00:07:38,837 --> 00:07:45,046
You always read the newspapers, right?

69
00:07:45,046 --> 00:07:50,129
You check the headlines,
local news, financial section,

70
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:53,295
and the editorials everyday.

71
00:07:53,295 --> 00:07:55,169
Why do you look so surprised?

72
00:07:55,169 --> 00:07:59,212
You have to do that in order
to get into the Royal Academy.

73
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:02,169
Do you know what they look for

74

attendant for the Royal Academy?

75
00:08:04,212 --> 00:08:05,504
No.

76
00:08:05,504 --> 00:08:08,169
It's passion.

77
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:11,587
You need passion if you want to work as

78
00:08:11,587 --> 00:08:15,295
an attendant and study at the
Royal Academy at the same time.

79
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:24,169
You're halfway there if you can assure
them that you're very eager to study.

80
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:27,212
I better get going. I have a class.

81
00:08:27,253 --> 00:08:30,169
Bye, Your Highness.

82
00:08:31,337 --> 00:08:39,337
Oh, I didn't say that last night
because I expected an answer.

83
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:44,712
But, I hope to hear an answer someday.

84
00:09:15,212 --> 00:09:18,169
Hey.

85
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:21,169
Uh...

86
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:24,587
I don't know how much
I should water the plant.

87
00:09:24,587 --> 00:09:29,088
It's withering.

88
00:09:29,088 --> 00:09:30,962
Maybe it's because of the cold weather.

89
00:09:30,962 --> 00:09:33,337
Or, maybe it's because you've
watered it too much, Your Highness.

90
00:09:33,337 --> 00:09:39,169
I think you should check the soil
and only water it when it's completely dry.

91
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:44,169
When you do, use a lot of
water to wet the entire soil.

92
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:59,088
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

93
00:09:59,088 --> 00:10:07,169
It seems the investigation will close as an
act carried out by that lone individual.

94
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:12,712
I'm sure he found a way out
when he planned this.

95
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:16,212
It's just very frustrating to
see that he's slipping away,

96
00:10:16,212 --> 00:10:21,504
making the Prince's effort futile.

97
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:25,169
I don't know what to say.

98
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:30,212
But, there is one disturbing matter.

99
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,879
What is it?

100
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:36,169
According to the report, this man also
personally guarded the Prime Minister,

101
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:41,169
so they had to investigate him as well.

102
00:10:41,169 --> 00:10:46,420
The Prime Minister?

103
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,169
It can't be!

104
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:53,088
As you know, he's the person I trust

105
00:10:53,088 --> 00:10:57,129
and depend on the most
from the Royal Council.

106
00:10:57,129 --> 00:11:01,837
I requested an interview with the Prime
Minister because I was confused as well.

107
00:11:01,837 --> 00:11:07,671
I'll give Your Highness a more detailed
report once I've spoken with him.

108
00:11:07,671 --> 00:11:11,295
You know who I suspect to
be behind this, right?

109
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:16,169
However, he's been declared innocent.

110
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:19,527
We couldn't find anything
else to investigate on him.

111
00:11:19,527 --> 00:11:22,346
Hmm...

112
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:55,169
Did you come here for your lunch break?

113
00:11:55,169 --> 00:11:56,169
Yes.

114
00:11:56,169 --> 00:11:58,462
Then, you probably haven't had lunch yet.

115
00:11:58,462 --> 00:12:00,379
I haven't eaten yet either.

116
00:12:00,462 --> 00:12:03,169
Why don't we have lunch
together at the cafeteria?

117
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:07,169
No, I have to go back soon.

118
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:10,921
I'm sorry.

119
00:12:35,169 --> 00:12:37,587
What are you doing here?

120
00:12:37,587 --> 00:12:43,169
Your father has been very disturbed lately.

121
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:48,754
I think you should refrain yourself for now.

122
00:12:48,754 --> 00:12:50,253
Really?

123
00:12:50,295 --> 00:12:53,337
Your Highness.

124
00:12:53,337 --> 00:12:59,169
I'm sure you know that my mind is made up.

125
00:12:59,169 --> 00:13:01,169
You've known me ever since we were little.

126
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:04,169
I'm sure you know.

127
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:10,169
Siyun, am I wrong?

128
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:18,754
You've come all the way to the Royal Academy.
What is it you really want to say?

129
00:13:18,754 --> 00:13:21,879
What did my father order you to tell me?

130
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:28,169
I'm in a position to do anything
the Grand Prince orders me to do.

131
00:13:28,169 --> 00:13:31,671
Please understand.

132
00:13:31,671 --> 00:13:36,671
You'll never win against your father.

133
00:13:36,671 --> 00:13:40,169
Just do as he says.

[Prince Hours]

135
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,169
I haven't been able to reach you lately.

136
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:03,169
Oh, really?

137
00:14:03,169 --> 00:14:05,504
I wonder why.

138
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:08,796
I was a little busy taking care
of my duties at the palace,

139
00:14:08,796 --> 00:14:13,169
but I'll tell my chamberlain to have
you reach me whenever you need.

140
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:15,962
If it's the palace, do you
mean your school buddy?

141
00:14:15,962 --> 00:14:18,169
Yes.

142
00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:20,462
Your engagement is coming up.

143
00:14:20,462 --> 00:14:24,169
I don't think you should continue being
Prince Youngsung's school buddy.

144
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,764
But it's Her Majesty's order...

145
00:14:27,653 --> 00:14:29,653
Hmmmm...

146
00:14:29,653 --> 00:14:34,088
It's hard for me to tell her,
and it's hard for you as well.

147
00:14:34,088 --> 00:14:38,169
I think you should talk to
Prince Youngsung about this later.

148
00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:46,169
Are you getting along with Joon?

149
00:14:46,169 --> 00:14:49,712
Yes, we're getting along.

150
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:57,088
Saeryung.

151
00:14:57,088 --> 00:15:02,169
You've known Joon ever since you were little.

152
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:05,796
He seems strong on the outside,

153
00:15:05,796 --> 00:15:10,169
but he's always been compassionate
toward poor creatures.

154
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:17,212
He always brought stray cats
and wounded pigeons home.

155
00:15:17,253 --> 00:15:19,629
He did.

156
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:24,129
I know that you don't love Joon.

157
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:36,295
But, fate is a funny thing.

158
00:15:36,337 --> 00:15:41,462
Some people are destined to live
together even if they're not in love.

159
00:15:41,587 --> 00:15:50,169
But, if you obey and follow your fate,
you might be able to find love.

160
00:15:53,504 --> 00:15:59,169
I'm really sorry to say this, Mother.

161
00:15:59,169 --> 00:16:03,169
But, I've been distressed because

162
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:05,169
Joon has been paying attention
to someone else lately.

163
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:08,169
What do you mean?

164
00:16:46,504 --> 00:16:52,169
What's your name?

165
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:57,337
My name is Yang Sooneui, Your Highness.

166
00:16:57,379 --> 00:16:59,837
I see.

167
00:17:08,253 --> 00:17:11,169
This tea is bitter.

168
00:17:11,169 --> 00:17:17,545
Either the water temperature is too high,
or you boiled the tea for too long.

169
00:17:17,545 --> 00:17:23,169
I'm sorry. I'll bring you
another cup right away.

170
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:07,169
What brings you here, Mother?

171
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:11,587
I felt as though I haven't paid much
attention to you ever since you've come

172
00:18:11,587 --> 00:18:19,169
into the palace, especially when
your engagement is coming up soon.

173
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:22,169
I saw Saeryung today.

174
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:25,088
I showed her the royal wedding
ring and talked to her about

175
00:18:25,088 --> 00:18:30,169
how a lady should prepare for
the most important day of her life.

176
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:35,504
Mother, I already told you that I...

177
00:18:43,379 --> 00:18:45,169
I need another cup of tea.

178
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:49,170
Yes, Your Highness. Would you like to drink
the same kind of tea, Your Highness?

179
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,337
I already had some before I got here.

180
00:18:52,337 --> 00:18:56,169
You can go back to what you were doing.

181
00:19:06,253 --> 00:19:11,879
If you don't want to drink tea,
I should get going.

182
00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:12,879
Already?

183
00:19:12,879 --> 00:19:17,004
I was here before you got here.

184
00:19:17,004 --> 00:19:22,169
People might make a fuss if an outsider
like me stays in the palace for too long.

185
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:23,962
There are a lots of eyes
watching you in the palace.

186
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:30,169
You can never be too careful.

187
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:36,169
Obey your father instead of fighting
against him about the engagement.

188
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:41,295
You know what kind of a man he is.

189
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:05,420
You're that attendant I saw earlier.

190
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,169
Yes, Your Highness.

191
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:11,754
I don't think you're taking
care of this place properly.

192
00:20:11,754 --> 00:20:14,212
I couldn't find a bar of
soap in the bathroom.

193
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:16,129
Pardon?

194
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:23,879
That can't be true.
This morning, I definitely...

195
00:20:23,879 --> 00:20:26,379
Really?

196
00:20:26,379 --> 00:20:28,754
Then, I must be wrong.

197
00:20:28,754 --> 00:20:31,754
Uh...

198
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,796
What?

199
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:48,837
But, I didn't find any ring
when I went inside.

200
00:20:48,837 --> 00:20:50,169
I'm serious.

201
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:53,337
But, you did go inside
after the Duchess left.

202
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:56,754
Eunuch Kwak! Are you
calling Yang Sooneui a liar?

203
00:20:56,754 --> 00:20:58,169
Huh?

204
00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:02,962
No, but look at the circumstances.

205
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:08,420
She's the only person who went inside
Prince Moonsung's chamber since then!

206
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:12,169
Yes, but...

207
00:21:17,587 --> 00:21:21,088
Lady Han is here.

208
00:21:24,337 --> 00:21:28,545
As the head court lady of Jipyoung Tower,

209
00:21:28,545 --> 00:21:36,169
I sincerely apologize for what
has happened, Your Highness.

210
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:40,169
You don't need to ask for my forgiveness.

211
00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:46,169
This is my fault for not handling
an important ring with care.

212
00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:51,169
I don't know what to say.

213
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:57,962
I'm glad you're working at Jipyoung Tower.

214
00:21:57,962 --> 00:22:01,004
I'm honored to hear that.

215
00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:13,169
Come to think of it, it's been
a long time, Lady Han.

216
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:22,046
- Bring Attendant Yang.
- I will, Lady Han.

217
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:36,837
I don't think you should
meddle in this affair.

218
00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:45,169
The royal wedding ring? That ring
with the inscription on it?

219
00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:48,587
The artisan made three of the same rings.

220
00:22:48,587 --> 00:22:51,253
One is in the Royal Museum.

221
00:22:51,253 --> 00:22:54,169
One of the remaining two is missing.

222
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:58,169
What will happen if Attendant
Yang doesn't give it back?

223
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:01,420
She'll get into big trouble after
the justice committee gets together.

224
00:23:01,545 --> 00:23:03,253
They don't have to hold a meeting.

225
00:23:03,337 --> 00:23:08,169
She'll get fired right away
and even go to jail.

226
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:10,212
Poor Attendant Yang.

227
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:11,379
She got into so much trouble.

228
00:23:11,504 --> 00:23:16,921
Why should we feel sorry for her?
She has some nerve!

229
00:23:16,921 --> 00:23:19,420
What did you just say?

230
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:23,169
I think I heard something about a ring.

231
00:23:24,462 --> 00:23:29,169
Lady, I have no idea what happened.

232
00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:32,004
I swear to heaven!

233
00:23:32,004 --> 00:23:36,169
Even if you're innocent,
someone has to be held liable

234
00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:43,253
if we can't find the
Grand Prince's wedding ring.

235
00:23:43,253 --> 00:23:47,712
I will be held liable as the sole
overseer of Jipyoung Tower.

236
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:53,169
And so will you, since
you're the only suspect.

237
00:23:53,169 --> 00:23:54,169
Lady...

238
00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:58,129
You should be prepared for the worst.

239
00:24:00,295 --> 00:24:02,169
I said, move!

240
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:06,169
Lady Han has ordered me
not to let anyone inside.

241
00:24:06,169 --> 00:24:10,169
Do you know whom you're dealing with here?

242
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:12,169
Who am I?

243
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:15,004
No one can stop me from going
anywhere in this building!

244
00:24:15,004 --> 00:24:17,430
Since the days of the Joseon Era,

245
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:25,629
even the king himself was not allowed to
meddle in the palace servants' affairs.

246
00:24:25,629 --> 00:24:27,879
Forgive me, Your Highness.

247
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:29,504
Lady Park!

248
00:24:29,504 --> 00:24:35,169
Your Highness, there are too
many eyes watching you.

249
00:24:37,253 --> 00:24:44,169
I'll send you a message as
soon as this issue is resolved.

250
00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:13,212
What will happen if we can't find the ring?

251
00:25:13,253 --> 00:25:19,337
Attendant Yang will get fired
for sure, as Lady Han said.

252
00:25:19,337 --> 00:25:22,169
Poor kid.

253
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:25,504
She always gets into trouble.

254
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,295
I can't find it!

255
00:25:30,169 --> 00:25:32,295
Tell me the truth, Mother.

256
00:25:32,295 --> 00:25:34,169
A person's life is on the line.

257
00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:37,169
I don't know what you're talking about.

258
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:42,169
I'm very upset that I lost the ring.

259
00:25:42,253 --> 00:25:46,004
Whoever stole it will be punished.

260
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:47,169
Mother!

261
00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:50,671
I was surprised to see you come home.

262
00:25:50,671 --> 00:25:56,169
I guess you're not here
out of concern for me.

263
00:25:56,169 --> 00:26:00,046
It's not too late to tell the truth...

264
00:26:00,046 --> 00:26:03,629
You don't trust me, do you?

265
00:26:12,629 --> 00:26:15,837
At least you didn't get fired.

266
00:26:15,837 --> 00:26:23,169
You're only going to be suspended
for 3 months. It'll pass quickly!

267
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:24,169
Just take a break.

268
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:28,169
You should travel overseas.

269
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:52,212
What happened?

270
00:26:52,212 --> 00:26:56,420
I can't come to work for 3 months.

271
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:00,169
And then what'll happen?

272
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,169
I don't know yet.

273
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:12,046
I'm sorry I didn't take good
care of you while I was here.

274
00:27:12,046 --> 00:27:14,796
Goodbye.

275
00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:01,169
It seems as though we're the only two people

276
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:08,587
in this palace who think
Attendant Yang has been framed.

277
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:17,629
I thought hard about what to do,
but I can't find a better solution.

278
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:22,337
You're the only person who can save her.

279
00:28:22,504 --> 00:28:27,169
I don't know what you're talking about.

280
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:46,046
Do you know what this ring means to you?

281
00:28:46,046 --> 00:28:52,170
You can say this is an ID that can prove
your legitimacy in the royal family.

282
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,169
This ring is the reason

283
00:28:54,169 --> 00:29:01,129
why a delivery boy was able to
become a candidate to the throne.

284
00:29:01,129 --> 00:29:07,879
If you lose this, it can mean
trouble for you later on.

285
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:21,962
I was the presumptive heir for 7 years
until you showed up with this ring.

286
00:29:21,962 --> 00:29:23,462
And now you're going to give it up?

287
00:29:23,587 --> 00:29:33,921
I don't know about you, but I take pride
in my old self from my delivery days.

288
00:29:33,921 --> 00:29:37,504
I will change as time goes by.

289
00:29:37,504 --> 00:29:45,962
But, I will never regret
or be ashamed of my past.

290
00:29:45,962 --> 00:29:51,169
Even if I have to go back to
Incheon because of this ring,

291
00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:58,379
I will accept it if this ring can
be used to save a framed person.

292
00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:13,169
Tell them that you found it here.

293
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:45,295
I have a favor to ask you.

294
00:30:45,295 --> 00:30:48,796
Please keep this a secret
from Attendant Yang.

295
00:30:48,796 --> 00:30:53,169
She has too much self-respect
to be pleased about this.

296
00:30:53,169 --> 00:30:54,337
And, she'd be bothered because

297
00:30:54,337 --> 00:30:59,671
that means she's still not free
from the false accusation.

298
00:30:59,671 --> 00:31:03,837
Okay, I'll do as you say.

299
00:31:32,253 --> 00:31:35,169
Don't cry, Yongnam.

300
00:31:35,169 --> 00:31:39,169
I can't believe it.

301
00:32:06,169 --> 00:32:08,169
Hello?

302
00:32:30,212 --> 00:32:34,169
Everything has been resolved.

303
00:32:41,504 --> 00:32:44,129
I'm sorry.

304
00:32:47,462 --> 00:32:54,169
You may still be mad at my mother,
but I hope you can forgive her.

305
00:32:54,169 --> 00:32:57,169
No, there's nothing to forgive.

306
00:32:57,169 --> 00:32:58,712
How can I dare to...

307
00:32:58,712 --> 00:33:05,295
Thank you so much for
everything, Your Highness.

308
00:33:05,379 --> 00:33:07,587
Thank you!

309
00:33:16,169 --> 00:33:19,169
I don't understand.

310
00:33:19,169 --> 00:33:22,169
How can there be two rings?

311
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:28,169
That's probably Prince Youngsung's ring.

312
00:33:28,169 --> 00:33:31,462
I will tell Siyun to look into it further.

313
00:33:31,462 --> 00:33:38,169
But, I think he and Joon got
together to help Attendant Yang.

314
00:33:41,462 --> 00:33:46,545
I'm still glad we gained something from this.

315
00:33:46,545 --> 00:33:51,754
Joon is not the only person with a weak spot.

316
00:33:51,754 --> 00:33:54,170
Weak spot?

317
00:33:54,170 --> 00:34:01,796
Dear, do you know what the
weakest spot in a person is?

318
00:34:01,796 --> 00:34:06,962
Some people have very fatal weaknesses.

319
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:13,169
If you can find that weakness and attack it,
that person will fall at once.

320
00:34:13,169 --> 00:34:18,169
And, what can that be?

321
00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:29,545
If you fall in love, the person you
love will be your greatest weakness.

322
00:34:29,545 --> 00:34:33,671
You fished for something small
to put on the dinner table,

323
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:38,169
but unexpectedly caught a big fish.

324
00:34:43,169 --> 00:34:48,504
And, we got an unexpected gift as well.

325
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:51,254
Prince, you seem to
have a lot thoughts today.

326
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:01,081
The 11th month of the lunar
calendar is truly long.

327
00:36:02,192 --> 00:36:05,360
It was really hard to pass that barley hump.

328
00:36:06,897 --> 00:36:10,795
You're not from that time period,
are you, Your Highness?

329
00:36:12,305 --> 00:36:16,702
But, the winter night is very long.

330
00:36:17,524 --> 00:36:21,551
Long summer afternoon, long winter night...

331
00:36:22,689 --> 00:36:23,189
Hmm?

332
00:36:23,743 --> 00:36:27,376
Long summer afternoon, long winter night,

333
00:36:28,189 --> 00:36:32,114
When my life ends,
I will be buried next to my love.

334
00:36:32,553 --> 00:36:35,060
How do you know that poem, Prince?

335
00:36:35,938 --> 00:36:37,214
It's a poem?

336
00:36:39,226 --> 00:36:42,696
The arrowroot vine grew
and covers the thornbush.

337
00:36:42,696 --> 00:36:45,999
The beggar vine grew and fills the fields.

338
00:36:45,999 --> 00:36:52,296
Since my beloved is not here,
I need to stay home alone.

339
00:36:52,296 --> 00:36:56,530
Long summer afternoon, long winter night.

340
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:00,466
When my life ends, I will
be buried next to my love.

341
00:37:03,269 --> 00:37:10,472
Isn't this "Arrowroot Life" from the Book of
Odes? Where did you learn this poem?

342
00:37:10,472 --> 00:37:17,062
I never learned it, but when I was
young, my mom would often...

343
00:37:17,062 --> 00:37:19,122
I thought it was some lyrics from a song.

344
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:24,570
Really... So, your mother
would often recite this?

345
00:37:25,029 --> 00:37:30,623
Yes... But, who wrote this poem?

346
00:37:31,062 --> 00:37:34,850
The Book of Odes is the oldest
collection of poetry in China.

347
00:37:35,691 --> 00:37:37,690
Together with the Book of Documents
and Book of Changes,

348
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,280
they are called the Three Classics.

349
00:37:42,214 --> 00:37:46,825
The Book of Odes is divided into the "Airs
of the States," court songs, and eulogies.

350
00:37:46,825 --> 00:37:50,606
Out of these, the "Airs of the States" is
composed of different regions' folk songs,

351
00:37:50,606 --> 00:37:54,387
so we don't know who wrote them.

352
00:37:55,913 --> 00:38:01,308
They say that "Arrowroot Life," which
we recited just now, was written by a

353
00:38:01,308 --> 00:38:09,338
forlorn wife whose husband is at war
and has not returned for a long time.

354
00:38:11,895 --> 00:38:13,784
I am curious about something.

355
00:38:13,784 --> 00:38:16,409
Hm... Ask.

356
00:38:17,321 --> 00:38:22,467
Where is my father buried?

357
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:35,053
Do you want to go see him? The Empress
has already mentioned it a couple times.

358
00:38:35,363 --> 00:38:40,662
But, we wanted to wait until
you asked about it.

359
00:38:44,611 --> 00:38:48,183
I think it is about time.

360
00:38:53,169 --> 00:38:55,169
You must've been distressed.

361
00:38:55,169 --> 00:39:02,169
But, I hope you can leave that
behind and strive to work harder.

362
00:39:02,169 --> 00:39:03,879
Thank you, Lady Han.

363
00:39:03,879 --> 00:39:07,169
Starting from tomorrow, you may go
back to your scheduled assignments.

364
00:39:07,169 --> 00:39:08,624
Yes, Lady Han.

365
00:39:08,624 --> 00:39:16,545
Oh, Prince Youngsung will visit
Grand Prince Hyoin's grave tomorrow.

366
00:39:16,545 --> 00:39:21,295
He'll be out of his chambers the whole day.
Clean his room with Attendant Ma.

367
00:39:21,337 --> 00:39:26,921
But I'm banned from Prince
Youngsung's chambers.

368
00:39:26,921 --> 00:39:31,462
You're released from that punishment as well.

369
00:39:31,587 --> 00:39:34,379
From now on, be more careful.

370
00:39:34,379 --> 00:39:39,169
Thank you, Lady Han!

371
00:39:48,169 --> 00:39:50,962
I thought I was never going to see you again.

372
00:39:50,962 --> 00:39:54,837
You're back?

373
00:39:54,837 --> 00:39:57,837
Yes, I'm back.

374
00:39:57,837 --> 00:40:02,879
I couldn't have done it without
Prince Moonsung's help.

375
00:40:02,879 --> 00:40:05,379
Then...

376
00:40:09,864 --> 00:40:12,919
[Prince Hours]

377
00:40:20,379 --> 00:40:22,170
What are you laughing about, Eunuch Kwak?

378
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,712
Look!

379
00:40:24,712 --> 00:40:26,837
I found this funny video
clip on the internet.

380
00:40:26,837 --> 00:40:31,088
It's out of control!

381
00:40:31,088 --> 00:40:34,253
Hey! They're Koreans.

382
00:40:34,253 --> 00:40:37,629
Whoa!

383
00:40:37,629 --> 00:40:40,545
Come here, Yang Sooneui!

384
00:40:40,587 --> 00:40:43,169
They're hot!

385
00:40:43,169 --> 00:40:45,504
I wish the picture were clearer.

386
00:40:45,504 --> 00:40:49,169
I want to see their faces more clearly.

387
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:53,921
- What the...
- Do you know who they are?

388
00:40:56,462 --> 00:41:01,169
He's... he's...

389
00:41:09,642 --> 00:41:11,680
Uh...

390
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,169
Are you going somewhere?

391
00:41:15,169 --> 00:41:20,169
Oh, no... I forgot about our study session.

392
00:41:20,169 --> 00:41:24,712
I'm on my way to see my father's burial
site. This was scheduled unexpectedly.

393
00:41:24,712 --> 00:41:27,169
They must've forgotten to call you.

394
00:41:27,169 --> 00:41:29,169
That's fine, Your Highness.

395
00:41:29,169 --> 00:41:32,754
I'm sorry, Miss Saeryung.

396
00:41:32,754 --> 00:41:37,462
Madam Chamberlain, can Miss Saeryung join us?

397
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:42,169
As long as Miss Saeryung's fine with that.

398
00:42:04,337 --> 00:42:12,504
Hey, I don't think he knows
yet. What should we do?

399
00:42:12,504 --> 00:42:14,169
Yang Sooneui!

400
00:42:14,169 --> 00:42:18,169
Grand Chamberlain, did the Prince leave?

401
00:42:18,169 --> 00:42:20,754
Yes, Your Majesty.

402
00:42:20,754 --> 00:42:23,504
What should we do?

403
00:42:23,504 --> 00:42:27,169
I think it's too late to stop
this from reaching the press.

404
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:33,169
Your Majesty, you should stop
them to the best of your ability.

405
00:42:37,169 --> 00:42:43,169
Grand Chamberlain, call the Office of
Public Affairs and contact the press.

406
00:42:43,169 --> 00:42:45,169
There might be a solution.

407
00:42:45,169 --> 00:42:50,169
Excuse me for saying this, but there's
something I can't understand.

408
00:42:50,169 --> 00:42:58,169
The press somehow got the
video before it went online.

409
00:42:58,169 --> 00:43:03,545
It's almost time for the evening papers.

410
00:43:03,545 --> 00:43:07,169
That means someone
deliberately did this again...

411
00:43:07,169 --> 00:43:14,169
The Imperial Court has another reason now.

412
00:43:14,169 --> 00:43:21,169
I don't understand why
these things are happening.

413
00:43:21,169 --> 00:43:27,169
Your Majesty, I'll call Madam
Chamberlain and notify the Prince.

414
00:43:27,169 --> 00:43:37,253
No, it won't matter even if the
Prince finds this out sooner.

415
00:43:37,253 --> 00:43:42,169
Besides, he's probably not
in a good mood right now.

416
00:43:42,169 --> 00:43:44,169
Just notify Madam Chamberlain only.

417
00:43:44,169 --> 00:43:47,379
And, bring the Prince to me as soon
as he comes back to the palace.

418
00:43:47,379 --> 00:43:51,169
Yes, Your Majesty.

419
00:44:05,337 --> 00:44:08,169
What happened?

420
00:44:08,169 --> 00:44:12,169
How can you do this to your friend?

421
00:44:12,169 --> 00:44:15,046
- It wasn't me!
- Then, what?

422
00:44:15,046 --> 00:44:19,504
Did the video just walk out of
your cell phone? Huh? Did it?

423
00:44:19,504 --> 00:44:22,004
Guys, be quiet.

424
00:44:22,004 --> 00:44:24,169
We should first figure out what happened.

425
00:44:24,169 --> 00:44:29,337
Okay, okay, okay. Mr. Cho's right.
Let's figure out what happened first.

426
00:44:29,462 --> 00:44:31,754
Tell me the truth.

427
00:44:31,754 --> 00:44:34,129
Did someone offer you
money for the video? Huh?

428
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:36,796
- Or, did you try to sell it...
- No!

429
00:44:36,796 --> 00:44:39,712
You guys are the only people
I showed the clip to!

430
00:44:39,712 --> 00:44:41,837
Hey! Did you upload it onto your homepage?

431
00:44:41,837 --> 00:44:42,921
No, I said!

432
00:44:42,921 --> 00:44:48,837
Did you download it? Did you?

433
00:44:48,879 --> 00:44:52,169
Uh, well...

434
00:44:52,253 --> 00:44:54,253
You did!

435
00:44:54,253 --> 00:45:00,169
Look at me straight in the eye.
Who did you send it to?

436
00:45:00,253 --> 00:45:02,169
No one.

437
00:45:02,169 --> 00:45:05,796
You see, when I was at the internet cafe...

438
00:45:05,796 --> 00:45:09,170
The internet cafe?

439
00:45:11,712 --> 00:45:13,169
I wanted to see it on a bigger screen...

440
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:16,169
Why did you want to do that?

441
00:45:16,169 --> 00:45:21,545
Did you delete the file
after you downloaded it?

442
00:45:21,545 --> 00:45:25,671
Uh...

443
00:45:25,671 --> 00:45:27,169
I probably did...

444
00:45:27,169 --> 00:45:29,379
What, you punk?

445
00:45:32,169 --> 00:45:37,004
You should be more careful from now on.

446
00:45:37,004 --> 00:45:42,169
The things you do carelessly
can create trouble for Hoo.

447
00:45:42,169 --> 00:45:43,174
Okay.

448
00:45:43,174 --> 00:45:45,154
Geez...

449
00:46:02,169 --> 00:46:04,420
This is so strange.

450
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:14,088
When I first heard about my
father, I didn't feel anything.

451
00:46:14,088 --> 00:46:17,462
It was so unreal.

452
00:46:17,462 --> 00:46:23,337
I thought, "Oh, I see."

453
00:46:23,337 --> 00:46:33,169
But, after I saw his picture, I felt
as though I've known my father

454
00:46:33,169 --> 00:46:41,169
even though he passed away without
even knowing that he had a son.

455
00:46:41,169 --> 00:46:44,253
I wonder why?

456
00:46:44,253 --> 00:46:47,004
Why?

457
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:55,671
The world will say it's
because you two are family.

458
00:46:55,671 --> 00:47:00,962
Family, family...

459
00:47:12,169 --> 00:47:17,962
What are you guys doing here?

460
00:47:17,962 --> 00:47:22,046
This place is not open to the public!

461
00:47:22,046 --> 00:47:23,169
Get out!

462
00:47:23,169 --> 00:47:25,169
Watch what you say!

463
00:47:25,169 --> 00:47:30,169
This is Prince Youngsung,
son of Grand Prince Hyoin.

464
00:47:30,169 --> 00:47:33,169
Prince Youngsung?

465
00:47:33,169 --> 00:47:35,169
I'm sorry for the late greeting.

466
00:47:35,169 --> 00:47:37,169
Thank you for taking
care of my father's grave...

467
00:47:37,169 --> 00:47:40,169
What do you think you're doing here? Get out!

468
00:47:40,169 --> 00:47:43,921
Stop it! You're being rude to His Highness.

469
00:47:43,921 --> 00:47:49,169
I can't believe a great man like
Grand Prince Hyoin has a son like him!

470
00:47:49,169 --> 00:47:51,462
So what if you're a royal descent?

471
00:47:51,462 --> 00:47:54,169
Your mother brought disgrace
to the Royal Court!

472
00:47:54,169 --> 00:47:57,046
What can we expect from her son?

473
00:47:57,046 --> 00:48:00,169
Please calm down. You're
being rude to His Highness.

474
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:07,504
He was raised by a mother who
was a disgrace to the Imperial Court!

475
00:48:07,504 --> 00:48:11,169
Who are you?

476
00:48:16,169 --> 00:48:19,169
I'm sorry, sirs.

477
00:48:19,169 --> 00:48:26,169
Thank you for taking good
care of my father's grave.

478
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:29,754
I hope you can continue to
keep up the good work.

479
00:48:52,337 --> 00:49:00,253
Madam Chamberlain, I hope you don't report
this to Her Majesty or the Empress Dowager.

480
00:49:00,379 --> 00:49:03,170
But, Your Highness...

481
00:49:03,295 --> 00:49:06,169
Please.

482
00:49:22,169 --> 00:49:25,462
How was the trip?

483
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:29,629
Good, but...

484
00:49:29,629 --> 00:49:33,420
I'm sure you've heard from Madam Chamberlain.

485
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:38,420
But, that was before I came to the palace...

486
00:49:38,462 --> 00:49:41,379
I know.

487
00:49:41,379 --> 00:49:47,504
I didn't call you to scold you.

488
00:49:47,504 --> 00:49:52,169
The video's already spread.

489
00:49:52,169 --> 00:49:55,169
It's not your friend's fault either.

490
00:49:55,169 --> 00:49:57,545
It happened before you came here.

491
00:49:57,545 --> 00:50:01,462
So try not to worry about it.

492
00:50:01,462 --> 00:50:08,504
However, the aftereffects will be huge.

493
00:50:08,504 --> 00:50:15,504
It may be too much for you to handle.

494
00:50:15,504 --> 00:50:23,420
But, be prepared to face
it calmly and firmly.

495
00:50:27,169 --> 00:50:30,169
The people are already agitated.

496
00:50:30,169 --> 00:50:35,169
This matter won't be solved easily.

497
00:50:35,169 --> 00:50:43,337
I hope you can overcome this crisis well.

498
00:50:43,337 --> 00:50:48,169
Can you do that for me?

499
00:50:48,169 --> 00:50:52,253
I'm sorry for being such an embarrassment.

500
00:50:52,379 --> 00:50:55,253
Don't say that.

501
00:50:55,337 --> 00:51:00,169
Looking down on your own self is like
looking down on the Imperial Court,

502
00:51:00,169 --> 00:51:02,837
and on me.

503
00:51:05,169 --> 00:51:08,420
You may go now.

504
00:51:08,462 --> 00:51:10,169

Yes, we are!

509

Yes, we are!

510
00:51:34,879 --> 00:51:38,004
Pose for the camera!

511
00:51:38,004 --> 00:51:40,170

Why couldn't you protect my mother?

515
00:52:20,046 --> 00:52:22,796
What did you say?

516
00:52:22,796 --> 00:52:30,337

My mother was an honest person.

that, even after 20 years.

00:53:02,169 --> 00:53:07,169
Why are you standing there? Go back.

523
00:53:09,004 --> 00:53:14,169
Yes, Your Majesty.

524
00:53:14,169 --> 00:53:20,462
You'll have to find that
answer out on your own.

525
00:53:20,462 --> 00:53:31,169
An emperor can change the world
with just one word or action.

526
00:53:31,169 --> 00:53:45,046
When an emperor is respected and loved,
the people will listen and trust his words.

527
00:53:45,046 --> 00:53:49,169
Think first about what you should do

528
00:53:49,169 --> 00:53:58,088
in order to change the prejudices
people have against your mother.

529
00:55:02,169 --> 00:55:05,545
That was a waste of time.

530
00:55:05,545 --> 00:55:10,169
The elders of the Imperial Court
can't tell you anything.

531
00:55:10,169 --> 00:55:12,420
They, too, were spectators.

532
00:55:12,462 --> 00:55:17,169
Do you believe that my mother was innocent?

533
00:55:20,921 --> 00:55:25,169
No one is willing to tell me the truth.

534
00:55:25,169 --> 00:55:27,545
The truth...

535
00:55:27,545 --> 00:55:32,169
It's okay. I'll find out for myself.

536
00:55:32,169 --> 00:55:38,169
If my mother didn't do it that
means the real criminal is out there.

537
00:55:59,169 --> 00:56:01,253
How dare you go there by yourself!

538
00:56:01,253 --> 00:56:04,046
Uh... Your Majesty...

539
00:56:04,046 --> 00:56:09,379
How long must I put up with
your reckless behavior?

540
00:56:11,169 --> 00:56:17,712
You're grounded until I give further orders.

541
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:06,169
Your Highness, it's late.

542
00:57:06,169 --> 00:57:09,169
You should rest.

543
00:57:10,337 --> 00:57:13,169
Your Highness.

544
00:57:49,004 --> 00:57:54,169
Your Highness, Mr. Cho Sangki is here.

545
00:58:07,504 --> 00:58:11,046
Mr. Cho.

546
00:58:13,337 --> 00:58:17,295
Your Highness...

547
00:58:33,169 --> 00:58:38,671
You look worn out after
what you've gone through.

548
00:58:38,671 --> 00:58:41,169
Really?

549
00:58:41,169 --> 00:58:46,879
Oh, no... a man's got to keep his looks.

550
00:58:49,169 --> 00:58:55,004
I scolded Bulbam and the rest of them.
They'll be careful from now on.

551
00:58:55,004 --> 00:59:02,169
You shouldn't have. Cheer them
up so they can do their job.

552
00:59:02,169 --> 00:59:06,212
I'll keep that in mind.

553
00:59:06,212 --> 00:59:10,169
My room is nice, isn't it?

554
00:59:10,169 --> 00:59:15,169
I've been wanting to show it off,
but I couldn't wait any longer.

555
00:59:15,169 --> 00:59:19,169
So, that's why I called you last night.

556
00:59:19,169 --> 00:59:25,169
I hope you feel relaxed
here in this nice place.

557
00:59:25,169 --> 00:59:28,169
I have a lot of room.

558
00:59:28,169 --> 00:59:31,295
Do you want to move in?

559
00:59:42,504 --> 00:59:49,170
I wanted to talk to you about
the scandal my mother was in.

560
00:59:49,212 --> 00:59:55,629
The Royal Investigation Commission
is already done with that case.

561
00:59:55,629 --> 01:00:00,365
Investigate it again, Mr. Cho.
There's definitely something amiss.

562
01:00:01,323 --> 01:00:03,747
No one in the Imperial Court,
including my uncle,

563
01:00:03,747 --> 01:00:08,587
who was on the Investigation Commission,
wants to tell me what happened.

564
01:00:08,587 --> 01:00:15,295
I can only depend on my faith
in my mother and you.

565
01:00:15,295 --> 01:00:17,253
Investigation Commission?

566
01:00:17,295 --> 01:00:20,420
Are you talking about Grand Prince Hyojang?

567
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:24,212
I don't want people to remember
my mother as a bad person,

568
01:00:24,212 --> 01:00:31,169
regardless of whether I become Crown Prince.

569
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:34,169
You're addressing her as "Mother" now.

570
01:00:34,169 --> 01:00:36,379
What?

571
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:45,169
I guess you're really turning into an adult.

572
01:00:45,169 --> 01:00:55,169
But, I don't think I can help you with that.

573
01:00:55,169 --> 01:00:56,587
Mr. Cho!

574
01:00:56,587 --> 01:01:01,295
It was a case that shook the
nation and broke apart a family.

575
01:01:01,295 --> 01:01:03,462
It's been buried for a long time.

576
01:01:03,462 --> 01:01:06,962
You can't just dig it up whenever you want.

577
01:01:06,962 --> 01:01:10,545
You knew my mother, too! She was framed!

578
01:01:10,629 --> 01:01:20,962
Even if you do find out the truth,
you must have the power to support it.

579
01:01:20,962 --> 01:01:26,671
If you don't have that power,
you can't handle the truth.

580
01:01:26,671 --> 01:01:32,169
You want to clear your mother
of that bribery charge, correct?

581
01:01:32,169 --> 01:01:36,004
Then, you should have the
appropriate power to deal with it.

582
01:01:36,004 --> 01:01:38,337
How do I do that?

583
01:01:38,337 --> 01:01:42,169
Become Crown Prince.

584
01:01:42,169 --> 01:01:48,169
If you become Crown Prince,
everything will change.

585
01:02:07,815 --> 01:02:09,497
[Prince Hours]

586
01:02:12,902 --> 01:02:15,835
Yang Sooneui! What are you doing here?

587
01:02:15,835 --> 01:02:17,760
Did you come to water the plants?

588
01:02:18,218 --> 01:02:19,938
Did His Highness go somewhere?

589
01:02:22,248 --> 01:02:27,572
Prince Youngsung is still
very young and unstable.

590
01:02:27,572 --> 01:02:33,158
It'll help him a lot if he can
marry a great woman like you.

591
01:02:34,002 --> 01:02:37,968
Saeryung... I might not go to
the engagement ceremony.

592
01:02:38,286 --> 01:02:40,686
I don't want to act against my will anymore.

593
01:02:40,686 --> 01:02:44,618
I hope you don't disappoint me.

594
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:49,172
I'm going to abandon my old name Kang Hoo.

595
01:02:51,979 --> 01:02:59,088
I will wager the future of
this country on you two Princes.
