1
00:00:04,389 --> 00:00:08,391
You want to clear your mother
of that bribery charge, correct?

2
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,327
Then, you should have the
appropriate power to deal with it.

3
00:00:14,043 --> 00:00:15,855
How do I do that?

4
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:18,511
Become Crown Prince.

5
00:00:19,738 --> 00:00:23,982
If you become Crown Prince,
everything will change

6
00:00:25,005 --> 00:00:28,591
With Your Highness as the center,
a sphere of authority will be formed.

7
00:00:29,992 --> 00:00:37,907
Even your enemies will bow down
to you and willingly work for you.

8
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,457
That's the way the world works.

9
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:49,837
And, you must be cautious
about Grand Prince Hyojang.

10
00:00:51,857 --> 00:00:56,952
No one knows what he may be
thinking behind his smiling face.

11
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:03,224
This is based on my experience,
so please be mindful of what I said.

12
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:13,855
[Prince Hours]

13
00:01:26,481 --> 00:01:29,438
Remember, martial arts is
about training the mind.

14
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:33,439
Concentrate, Your Highness.

15
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:54,439
I can't take it anymore.

16
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:58,438
Let's call it a day.

17
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:06,748
If you can hit me just once,
I'll let you end early today.

18
00:02:06,748 --> 00:02:07,248
Oh!

19
00:02:10,438 --> 00:02:13,438
Satisfied?

20
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:36,648
I thought you were banned from my chambers.

21
00:02:36,648 --> 00:02:41,814
Can you come in now?

22
00:02:41,814 --> 00:02:43,438
Your Highness.

23
00:02:43,438 --> 00:02:55,438
Please address me properly from now on
regardless of whether we're alone or not.

24
00:02:55,438 --> 00:02:59,438
I need you to help me.

25
00:02:59,438 --> 00:03:03,148
Just treat me as if I'm
just any other attendant.

26
00:03:03,148 --> 00:03:09,438
Just as any other attendant?

27
00:03:09,438 --> 00:03:13,439
Do you mean that?

28
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,856
Yes.

29
00:03:15,856 --> 00:03:21,438
Fine, I'll do as you say.

30
00:03:21,438 --> 00:03:23,481
Attendant Ma.

31
00:03:23,481 --> 00:03:25,648
Yes, Your Highness.

32
00:03:25,648 --> 00:03:29,731
I'd like to be alone. Can you leave?

33
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:34,148
Please tell that to Attendant Yang as well.

34
00:04:06,338 --> 00:04:07,838
Why did you do that for?

35
00:04:07,838 --> 00:04:09,338
Do what?

36
00:04:09,338 --> 00:04:13,338
Everything worked out fine.
You didn't have to do that to him!

37
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:18,673
He was really down today.

38
00:04:28,338 --> 00:04:34,464
The Prince's grades have been
improving thanks to Miss Saeryung.

39
00:04:34,464 --> 00:04:37,338
I am honored, Your Highness.

40
00:04:37,338 --> 00:04:39,598
I am honored.

41
00:04:39,598 --> 00:04:46,338
I'm glad. What kind of student
is Prince Youngsung?

42
00:04:46,338 --> 00:04:51,006
He doesn't admit it,
but I think he's very bright.

43
00:04:51,006 --> 00:04:55,338
I'm sure he'll get even better.

44
00:04:55,338 --> 00:05:00,338
Prince Youngsung is still
very young and unstable.

45
00:05:00,338 --> 00:05:07,338
It'll help him a lot if he can
marry a great woman like you.

46
00:05:07,338 --> 00:05:17,006
I'm truly honored Your Highness
is so fond of Saeryung.

47
00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:21,338
You have such a great daughter.

48
00:05:21,338 --> 00:05:24,338
You remind me of how I was
during my younger days.

49
00:05:24,338 --> 00:05:28,273
That's such a great compliment.

50
00:05:31,048 --> 00:05:33,506
Where's Prince Youngsung right now?

51
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:38,338
For today's lesson, we'll cover
the civil service exam questions

52
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:42,464
the King asked the scholars
during the Joseon Era.

53
00:05:42,464 --> 00:05:45,338
Did you skim through them?

54
00:05:45,338 --> 00:05:48,381
May I first ask a question?

55
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:52,589
You may make inquiries, not questions.

56
00:05:52,714 --> 00:05:55,338
You've been in this palace for a long time.

57
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:59,338
Can you tell me anything about
what happened to my mother?

58
00:05:59,338 --> 00:06:01,381
Forgive me, Your Highness.

59
00:06:01,381 --> 00:06:08,338
That's not part of my role as the court
lady in charge of your education.

60
00:06:08,338 --> 00:06:11,338
I knew it'd be hard for you to say.

61
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:12,422
Forgive me.

62
00:06:12,422 --> 00:06:14,338
It's fine.

63
00:06:14,338 --> 00:06:16,220
It's just that I keep having this thought.

64
00:06:17,574 --> 00:06:20,338
What is the point about
studying about the world

65
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:27,548
and wise men's teachings if I don't
even know where I come from?

66
00:06:27,548 --> 00:06:31,965
There's something called the
Korean Imperial Court Records.

67
00:06:31,965 --> 00:06:35,338
We don't record every single official
and private affair of the rulers anymore like

68
00:06:35,338 --> 00:06:42,131
the Royal Annals, but the
Imperial Court Records contain

69
00:06:42,131 --> 00:06:50,631
the issues and achievements
during a ruler's reign.

70
00:06:50,631 --> 00:06:53,338
Then, my mother's story is...

71
00:06:53,338 --> 00:06:56,048
Probably recorded in there.

72
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:59,338
I guess you haven't read them.

73
00:06:59,338 --> 00:07:07,257
Only the person on the throne
or the person with authority

74
00:07:07,257 --> 00:07:10,338
such as the heir apparent who
becomes the Prince Regent

75
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:20,714
during the Empress's absence,
can read it during that period.

76
00:07:20,714 --> 00:07:23,338
The heir apparent?

77
00:07:23,338 --> 00:07:25,840
You mean Crown Prince?

78
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,589
That's right.

79
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:34,756
Then, let's begin our lesson
for the day, Your Highness.

80
00:08:08,338 --> 00:08:12,338
You got off on the wrong foot.

81
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:15,589
You were the founding member
of an organization

82
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:19,338
that grew to be a threat in
abolishing the Imperial Court.

83
00:08:19,338 --> 00:08:27,048
As the Prime Minister who is respected
and trusted by the people

84
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:32,589
and Her Majesty the Empress, this is
probably a spot on your good record.

85
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:37,338
But, you've been hiding this for so long.

86
00:08:37,338 --> 00:08:47,714
Even the terrorist suspect at the charity
event used to be your personal bodyguard?

87
00:08:47,714 --> 00:08:55,338
If you want to correct your steps,
you have to start all over again.

88
00:08:55,422 --> 00:08:59,338
Can you do that?

89
00:09:19,338 --> 00:09:22,840
Finally, you smiled.

90
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,338
Is it because I helped you?

91
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:44,714
Not really, but thank you for everything.

92
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:49,673
I also feel bad for making you
tamper with the bathroom pipes.

93
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:55,338
I've never done something
like that in my life.

94
00:09:55,338 --> 00:09:58,798
Do you understand what I mean?

95
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:03,548
I didn't tamper with the pipes.

96
00:10:03,548 --> 00:10:05,589
What?

97
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:13,338
It was Prince Youngsung who
cleared the false accusation.

98
00:10:13,338 --> 00:10:16,338
Pardon?

99
00:10:26,338 --> 00:10:28,339
I'll put them away.

100
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:32,257
It's okay.

101
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:46,048
Can you tell me more about
what you said earlier?

102
00:10:46,048 --> 00:10:51,006
What do you mean Prince Youngsung
cleared the false accusation?

103
00:10:51,006 --> 00:10:56,338
I heard that you found
the ring in the bathroom.

104
00:10:56,338 --> 00:10:58,338
To be exact, Prince Youngsung didn't find it.

105
00:10:58,338 --> 00:11:02,589
He gave it up.

106
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:08,338
The ring Prince Youngsung wore
around his neck was made

107
00:11:08,338 --> 00:11:11,338
by the same artisan who
made the missing ring.

108
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:15,381
But... that doesn't make any sense.

109
00:11:15,381 --> 00:11:19,048
That ring's too important
to give away like that!

110
00:11:19,048 --> 00:11:26,257
He said that's the only way we can
save you and asked for my help.

111
00:11:26,257 --> 00:11:30,338
He also told me to keep it a secret from you.

112
00:11:32,381 --> 00:11:45,338
I don't want to admit it, but that's how
important you are to Prince Youngsung.

113
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:58,298
I wasn't going to tell you, but I thought
I should after I saw your smiling face.

114
00:11:58,298 --> 00:12:02,338
I want you to like me,

115
00:12:02,338 --> 00:12:08,338
but not at the expense of taking
credit for someone else's work.

116
00:12:08,338 --> 00:12:19,338
Does that mean Prince Youngsung can't get
his ring back until we find the missing ring?

117
00:12:39,506 --> 00:12:44,798
Did Prince Youngsung use all these
when he was living outside the palace?

118
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:47,422
That's right, Your Highness.

119
00:12:50,338 --> 00:12:53,338
What's this?

120
00:12:53,338 --> 00:12:56,090
You're supposed to ride on it.

121
00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:01,923
If you twist your body after placing
both feet, it will move forward.

122
00:13:03,612 --> 00:13:07,277
Place both feet...

123
00:13:07,277 --> 00:13:09,806
Your Highness, that's dangerous!

124
00:13:09,806 --> 00:13:10,503
Like this...

125
00:13:10,503 --> 00:13:13,234
- Oh!
- Oh, my!

126
00:13:20,338 --> 00:13:24,338
I must've forgotten how old I was.

127
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:27,673
I always want to try out new things.

128
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:32,048
Give these items back to Prince Youngsung.

129
00:13:32,048 --> 00:13:37,923
But, these items are unsuitable when
it comes to dignifying Prince Youngsung.

130
00:13:37,923 --> 00:13:47,840
He's probably upset because of
the video and about his mother.

131
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:55,338
I want to give these back
to him to console him.

132
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,338
Look here, Eunuch Kwak.

133
00:14:00,338 --> 00:14:02,338
Yes, Your Highness.

134
00:14:02,338 --> 00:14:05,338
This looks dangerous.

135
00:14:05,338 --> 00:14:14,131
Give it back to him after attaching
something that can make this safer.

136
00:14:14,131 --> 00:14:19,338
Yes, Your Highness.
I will do exactly as you say.

137
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:25,071
Oooh... Whoaaaa...

138
00:14:28,338 --> 00:14:31,338
What happened?

139
00:14:34,338 --> 00:14:40,381
Her Highness the Empress Dowager
told me to return these items to you.

140
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:45,048
I was just checking
if this was broken or not.

141
00:14:45,048 --> 00:14:51,257
I also added some features to
make the motorcycle safer.

142
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:56,381
Look! This is the latest model.

143
00:14:56,381 --> 00:14:58,929
Not only will this show
Your Highness where you are,

144
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:01,338
but it'll also tell you which
roads to take in real time.

145
00:15:01,338 --> 00:15:04,714
But why are you guys giving this back to me?

146
00:15:04,714 --> 00:15:10,338
Her Highness the Empress Dowager
wanted to console you...

147
00:15:10,338 --> 00:15:11,422
I don't need them anymore.

148
00:15:11,506 --> 00:15:15,338
Take them back.

149
00:15:25,464 --> 00:15:31,338
Thank you for returning
my things, Your Highness.

150
00:15:31,338 --> 00:15:35,338
Lady Han is strict, isn't she?

151
00:15:35,338 --> 00:15:42,338
She's hard to talk to because
she never does anything out of line.

152
00:15:42,338 --> 00:15:47,673
Try to understand her and get along with her.

153
00:15:47,673 --> 00:15:53,338
She's stern, but she has
a lot of good attributes.

154
00:15:53,338 --> 00:15:57,338
I see, Your Highness.

155
00:15:57,338 --> 00:16:05,338
You sent them to me out of concern,
but I don't think I need them anymore.

156
00:16:05,338 --> 00:16:06,840
What do you mean?

157
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,965
I'm going to abandon my old name Kang Hoo.

158
00:16:10,965 --> 00:16:11,923
Prince.

159
00:16:11,923 --> 00:16:16,631
From now on, I'll be reborn as Yi Hoo.

160
00:16:18,338 --> 00:16:22,131
Your Highness, I have a favor to ask.

161
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:28,338
A favor? What is it?

162
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,802
[Prince Hours]

163
00:16:42,381 --> 00:16:50,338
Come to think of it,
the two Princes are adults now.

164
00:16:50,338 --> 00:16:54,338
Maybe we should consider a royal wedding.

165
00:16:54,338 --> 00:17:00,631
But, I think Prince Youngsung needs
to adjust to palace life first.

166
00:17:00,631 --> 00:17:03,506
I think it's too early
to talk about marriage.

167
00:17:03,506 --> 00:17:07,548
I think there's something
Your Majesty doesn't realize.

168
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:12,338
Prince Youngsung returned
his old belongings to me.

169
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:15,338
He said he won't use them anymore.

170
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:19,131
He is finally adjusting to palace life.

171
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:27,338
I think Prince Moonsung is more
than ready to get married.

172
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:31,338
You're right.

173
00:17:31,338 --> 00:17:37,338
I know Grand Prince sees the
Deputy Prime Minister often.

174
00:17:37,338 --> 00:17:42,881
Do you know anything about his daughter?

175
00:17:45,338 --> 00:17:51,173
She has been good friends with
Joon ever since she was young.

176
00:17:51,173 --> 00:17:53,338
Really?

177
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:56,464
What kind of a person is she?

178
00:17:56,464 --> 00:18:02,338
She has always been an exemplary
child among her peers.

179
00:18:02,338 --> 00:18:07,006
She's very thoughtful and careful
in speech and action.

180
00:18:07,006 --> 00:18:08,506
I see.

181
00:18:08,506 --> 00:18:13,338
I'm sure Prince Moonsung gets
many offers for marriage.

182
00:18:13,338 --> 00:18:17,338
Are you interested in any of them?

183
00:18:17,338 --> 00:18:23,714
Actually, I've been meaning to tell you this.

184
00:18:23,714 --> 00:18:28,673
Prince Moonsung will be engaged.

185
00:18:28,673 --> 00:18:33,338
Engaged?

186
00:18:33,338 --> 00:18:36,338
That's great.

187
00:18:36,338 --> 00:18:40,215
Whose daughter is she?

188
00:18:40,215 --> 00:18:44,338
Deputy Prime Minister Shin's daughter.

189
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:52,381
You mean... Miss Saeryung?

190
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,673
That's right.

191
00:18:54,673 --> 00:19:00,338
Oh, I see...

192
00:19:00,338 --> 00:19:04,338
There was no talk of that before.

193
00:19:04,338 --> 00:19:10,048
Oh, I met the Deputy Prime
Minister not too long ago.

194
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:17,338
I asked him not to tell you for now

195
00:19:17,338 --> 00:19:23,338
because I thought I should
be the first one to tell you.

196
00:19:23,338 --> 00:19:24,464
Is that so?

197
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:34,298
We've been keeping it a secret because

198
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:39,859
we didn't want people to talk behind
our backs and call it a political marriage.

199
00:19:40,673 --> 00:19:45,338
Well, if you put it that way...

200
00:19:45,338 --> 00:19:52,338
A royal marriage needs the Imperial Court
and the Royal Council's approval.

201
00:19:52,338 --> 00:19:55,714
It's not an official engagement,

202
00:19:55,714 --> 00:20:02,381
but we're going to have an informal
engagement ceremony between the two families.

203
00:20:02,381 --> 00:20:07,338
I'm sorry for not seeking
your approval beforehand.

204
00:20:07,338 --> 00:20:11,338
I almost made a fool out of myself.

205
00:20:11,338 --> 00:20:17,257
The Deputy Prime Minister and
Grand Prince Hyojang had me fooled!

206
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:20,297
I would've made a fool out of myself if I had

207
00:20:20,297 --> 00:20:23,338
discussed getting Prince Youngsung
and Miss Saeryung married!

208
00:20:23,338 --> 00:20:26,338
That's not the problem here.

209
00:20:26,338 --> 00:20:30,338
A royal marriage needs to
follow the proper procedures,

210
00:20:30,338 --> 00:20:35,338
but he did everything on his own
and notified me in the end.

211
00:20:35,338 --> 00:20:39,257
He's belittling my authority
as an Empress because

212
00:20:39,257 --> 00:20:44,338
he has the Imperial Court and the
Royal Council on his side.

213
00:20:44,338 --> 00:20:50,422
Even though it's not an official
engagement, this is not right.

214
00:20:50,422 --> 00:20:55,338
Still, we can't ignore them now that we know.

215
00:20:55,338 --> 00:21:01,338
I think you should attend the engagement.

216
00:21:01,338 --> 00:21:03,173
Me?

217
00:21:03,173 --> 00:21:09,131
Someone from the Royal Family should go.

218
00:21:09,131 --> 00:21:12,338
How disturbing!

219
00:22:38,215 --> 00:22:45,173
I used to come here with my mom.

220
00:22:45,173 --> 00:22:51,338
I remember how you used to sing
in the choir when you were little.

221
00:22:51,338 --> 00:22:53,338
I remember...

222
00:22:53,338 --> 00:23:02,631
how you never were able to say no to
your strict father when you were little.

223
00:23:21,338 --> 00:23:29,338
Saeryung... I might not go to
the engagement ceremony.

224
00:23:29,338 --> 00:23:32,673
Joon.

225
00:23:32,673 --> 00:23:36,338
Are you sure you can disobey your father?

226
00:23:36,338 --> 00:23:42,338
I don't want to act against my will anymore.

227
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:48,714
Not coming to the engagement ceremony
means you'll decline my father's help.

228
00:23:48,714 --> 00:23:53,173
I don't care.

229
00:23:53,173 --> 00:23:55,338
Saeryung.

230
00:23:55,338 --> 00:23:57,338
I'm going to be there.

231
00:23:57,338 --> 00:24:00,338
I don't need anything else.

232
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:04,338
I hope you don't disappoint me.

233
00:24:04,338 --> 00:24:08,422
I won't be shaken anymore.

234
00:24:08,422 --> 00:24:12,338
I'll wait for you.

235
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:07,452
Your Highness.

236
00:25:47,382 --> 00:25:48,698
Oh, Yang Sooneui!

237
00:25:48,698 --> 00:25:52,110
What are you doing here?

238
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,724
Did you come to water the plants?

239
00:25:57,527 --> 00:25:59,555
Did His Highness go somewhere?

240
00:25:59,555 --> 00:26:01,046
He went on a special outing.

241
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:03,344
Special outing?

242
00:26:07,842 --> 00:26:11,967
Your Highness, your friends are here.

243
00:26:20,215 --> 00:26:24,215
How's it going?

244
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:29,215
Long time no see.

245
00:26:29,215 --> 00:26:34,215
Why the long faces, everyone?

246
00:26:34,215 --> 00:26:36,800
Is it because of the video?

247
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,215
I'm sorry, Hoo.

248
00:26:40,215 --> 00:26:44,967
I shouldn't have done that.

249
00:26:44,967 --> 00:26:47,215
Are you okay?

250
00:26:47,215 --> 00:26:49,215
I'll treat you guys to drinks tonight.

251
00:26:49,215 --> 00:26:54,050
Don't worry and let's get wild tonight, okay?

252
00:27:00,592 --> 00:27:01,035

00:27:47,258 --> 00:27:51,215
I might not be able to see you guys anymore.

267
00:27:51,215 --> 00:27:52,341
Kang Hoo!

268
00:27:52,341 --> 00:27:54,675
What are you talking about?

269
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:57,258
Is it because of the video?

270
00:27:57,258 --> 00:28:00,215
That was our mistake. It won't happen again.

271
00:28:00,215 --> 00:28:03,883
Hoo, don't even joke about stuff like that.

272
00:28:03,883 --> 00:28:07,215
That's harsh.

273
00:28:07,215 --> 00:28:09,591
Listen up.

274
00:28:09,591 --> 00:28:13,215
I have to become a different person.

275
00:28:13,215 --> 00:28:17,215
That video isn't a problem.

276
00:28:17,215 --> 00:28:23,216
I'm actually happy that I got
to do that with you guys.

277
00:28:23,216 --> 00:28:25,508
I'll always remember it.

278
00:28:25,508 --> 00:28:29,215
But, that will never happen again.

279
00:28:29,215 --> 00:28:30,425
Why?

280
00:28:30,425 --> 00:28:33,215
Though you're living in the
palace, but we're still friends.

281
00:28:33,215 --> 00:28:35,215
I'm not Kang Hoo anymore.

282
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:38,215
I'm Yi Hoo.

283
00:28:38,215 --> 00:28:44,508
If you're my real friends, then you
need to help me live as Yi Hoo.

284
00:28:44,508 --> 00:28:47,341
Understand?

285
00:28:49,258 --> 00:28:50,550
Eunuch Kwak.

286
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:53,883
Yes, Your Highness!

287
00:28:53,883 --> 00:28:56,591
Thank you for today.

288
00:28:56,591 --> 00:29:01,215
Now, please take my friends home.

289
00:29:01,215 --> 00:29:03,613
I will do as you say, Your Highness.

290
00:29:03,613 --> 00:29:04,943
Take care of yourselves.

291
00:29:09,215 --> 00:29:12,491
The car's ready.

292
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:49,215
Does this mean we can't
see each other anymore?

293
00:30:11,717 --> 00:30:14,216
It's time to go.

294
00:30:32,341 --> 00:30:38,299
What are you doing here, Attendant Yang?

295
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:42,842
I have something important
to tell His Highness.

296
00:30:46,215 --> 00:30:51,425
He's not inside?

297
00:30:51,425 --> 00:30:56,215
He should've been here by now.

298
00:31:58,842 --> 00:32:04,215
I heard everything from Prince Moonsung.

299
00:32:04,215 --> 00:32:08,134
I think I misunderstood you.

300
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,215
I'm sorry.

301
00:32:10,215 --> 00:32:16,215
And, thank you for helping me.

302
00:32:16,215 --> 00:32:19,215
You don't have to come
and report everything anymore.

303
00:32:19,215 --> 00:32:24,215
Don't worry about it.

304
00:32:24,215 --> 00:32:27,216
Kang Hoo.

305
00:32:27,216 --> 00:32:35,215
Like you said, let's keep it
as Prince and attendant.

306
00:32:35,215 --> 00:32:39,215
Besides, my name's not Kang Hoo.

307
00:32:39,215 --> 00:32:46,215
Address me as Yi Hoo if you need to.

308
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:48,883
What happened?

309
00:32:58,092 --> 00:33:01,215
Aren't you done working for the day?

310
00:33:01,215 --> 00:33:06,215
Go home, Attendant Yang.

311
00:33:25,215 --> 00:33:28,842
Where are you going this late at night?

312
00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:32,299
Home... to take care of some business.

313
00:33:32,383 --> 00:33:37,883
Why did you tell her?

314
00:33:37,883 --> 00:33:42,215
I thought you promised me
you wouldn't tell Attendant Yang.

315
00:33:42,215 --> 00:33:45,215
I thought I should tell her for your sake.

316
00:33:45,258 --> 00:33:51,215
We seem to have a different
understanding of what a promise is.

317
00:33:51,215 --> 00:33:55,425
I think a man's promise should be
kept under all circumstances.

318
00:33:55,425 --> 00:33:57,215
I'm sorry, Prince Youngsung.

319
00:33:57,215 --> 00:34:02,215
I admit I was wrong.

320
00:34:02,215 --> 00:34:07,341
To be honest, I looked down on you at first.

321
00:34:07,341 --> 00:34:13,215
I judged you and thought
you were no match for me.

322
00:34:13,215 --> 00:34:19,215
But now I know you have
a lot of good qualities.

323
00:34:19,215 --> 00:34:25,215
To be honest, I'm now a little worried.

324
00:34:25,215 --> 00:34:29,215
I like Attendant Yang.

325
00:34:29,215 --> 00:34:34,842
How do you feel about Attendant Yang?

326
00:34:34,842 --> 00:34:45,215
I want us to play fairly... whether it's
for Crown Prince or Attendant Yang.

327
00:34:45,215 --> 00:34:49,466
What do you think?

328
00:34:49,466 --> 00:34:56,215
I want to compete for the position
of Crown Prince as well.

329
00:34:56,258 --> 00:35:02,341
But, I don't think you have to worry
about me and Attendant Yang anymore.

330
00:35:02,341 --> 00:35:11,215
We used to be schoolmates, but she's
only my residential attendant now.

331
00:35:25,215 --> 00:35:30,425
Your Highness Prince Youngsung,
Her Majesty is looking for you.

332
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:54,134
Have a seat.

333
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:05,215
I heard drinking Chinese wolfberry tea
after drinking alcohol is good for you.

334
00:36:05,215 --> 00:36:10,215
Did you have a good time with
your friends in Incheon?

335
00:36:10,215 --> 00:36:14,215
Yes, Her Highness the Empress
Dowager approved...

336
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:21,215
When I heard you went outside
to meet your friends,

337
00:36:21,215 --> 00:36:28,215
I assumed you had made a decision.

338
00:36:28,215 --> 00:36:30,675
I don't know if I guessed right.

339
00:36:30,675 --> 00:36:37,425
When I left the palace without telling you,
you personally came and visited me.

340
00:36:37,425 --> 00:36:43,215
You took me to a Chinese restaurant
in Incheon and told me something

341
00:36:43,215 --> 00:36:47,215
before we came back.

342
00:36:47,215 --> 00:36:52,523
To live in the palace, your past
relations must be put aside,

343
00:36:52,523 --> 00:36:57,717
and new relations that the palace
accepts must be formed.

344
00:36:57,717 --> 00:37:01,466
You must throw away all things familiar,

345
00:37:01,466 --> 00:37:05,216
and willingly accept things
that are unfamiliar.

346
00:37:05,216 --> 00:37:11,175
I didn't understand what you
meant back then, but I do now.

347
00:37:11,175 --> 00:37:22,215
I met my old friends today because
I decided to leave my past life behind.

348
00:37:22,215 --> 00:37:28,508
I know you're sincere about your decision.

349
00:37:28,508 --> 00:37:36,425
Then, I should give you an
appropriate answer for your decision.

350
00:37:43,161 --> 00:37:48,694
Wow! I knew my son was handsome,
but you look especially handsome today!

351
00:37:50,805 --> 00:37:53,940
Today, your mother feels as though
she's gained the entire world.

352
00:37:56,762 --> 00:37:58,368
It's time for us to depart now.

353
00:37:59,256 --> 00:38:04,833
I still have some preparation to do,
so please go ahead. I'll go in my car.

354
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:11,225
Shall we then? Let's do that, Grand Prince.
Joon does have a lot to prepare.

355
00:38:11,225 --> 00:38:13,390
Alright, then we'll go
first and wait for you.

356
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,262
[Prince Hours]

357
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:52,268
Her Highness the Empress Dowager is here!

358
00:41:24,694 --> 00:41:31,694
Grand Prince! I can't marry off my daughter
to him after being humiliated like this!

359
00:41:31,694 --> 00:41:34,419
Let's call this marriage off!

360
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:39,419
Wait, Mr. Deputy Prime Minister!

361
00:41:39,419 --> 00:41:41,408
Let's go, Saeryung!

362
00:41:43,694 --> 00:41:44,836
Now!

363
00:42:08,694 --> 00:42:10,694
Are you serious?

364
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:16,446
Prince Moonsung didn't show up.

365
00:42:16,446 --> 00:42:22,694
I've never seen Grand Prince
Hyojang be so taken aback before.

366
00:42:22,694 --> 00:42:26,987
It must've been humiliating!

367
00:42:26,987 --> 00:42:31,694
I can't believe Prince Moonsung did that.

368
00:42:31,694 --> 00:42:37,862
He always did everything
his father told him to do...

369
00:42:37,862 --> 00:42:39,694
Now, the Deputy Prime Minister

370
00:42:39,694 --> 00:42:45,694
and Grand Prince Hyojang's
relationship will never be restored.

371
00:42:45,694 --> 00:42:49,694
That's one problem off your back.

372
00:42:54,694 --> 00:42:56,820
We'll see...

373
00:43:06,613 --> 00:43:07,694
Grand Prince!

374
00:43:07,694 --> 00:43:09,694
Calm down, please!

375
00:43:09,694 --> 00:43:13,613
Joon! Tell him that you're sorry!

376
00:43:13,613 --> 00:43:17,862
I didn't know you would
disappoint me like this.

377
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:21,694
How can you throw away your
sure shot to be Crown Prince?

378
00:43:21,694 --> 00:43:25,237
I didn't throw it away, father.

379
00:43:25,237 --> 00:43:30,694
I will compete with Prince Youngsung and win.

380
00:43:35,694 --> 00:43:39,945
No, no.

381
00:43:39,945 --> 00:43:46,571
I shouldn't leave a scar on
our future Emperor's body.

382
00:43:46,571 --> 00:43:53,196
I will persuade the Deputy Prime Minister
again to go through with the engagement.

383
00:43:53,196 --> 00:43:55,694
Keep this in mind.

384
00:43:55,694 --> 00:44:00,488
I won't let you disobey me again. Understand?

385
00:44:01,294 --> 00:44:04,694
No.

386
00:44:04,694 --> 00:44:11,487
No matter what you say,
I won't marry Saeryung.

387
00:44:11,487 --> 00:44:16,237
Even if you hold another
engagement ceremony, I won't go.

388
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:19,694
Grand Prince!

389
00:44:19,694 --> 00:44:25,694
Are you going to disobey me till the end?

390
00:44:25,694 --> 00:44:30,737
I don't want to live like you two.

391
00:44:30,737 --> 00:44:35,321
I don't want to marry someone
I don't even love to reach my goal.

392
00:44:35,321 --> 00:44:42,987
I don't want to be obsessed
over what I couldn't have either.

393
00:44:42,987 --> 00:44:47,112
I want to marry the person I love.

394
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:52,945
But, don't worry.

395
00:44:52,945 --> 00:45:02,654
I will be Crown Prince... as you wish.

396
00:45:02,654 --> 00:45:11,694
But, not with your help, Saeryung's
help, or anyone else's help.

397
00:45:11,694 --> 00:45:17,694
I will do it on my own.

398
00:45:17,694 --> 00:45:25,196
I will no longer remain a doll
that will fulfill your ambition.

399
00:45:28,694 --> 00:45:33,694
I should get back to the palace now.

400
00:45:46,737 --> 00:45:48,487
Joon!

401
00:45:48,487 --> 00:45:50,694
Joon!

402
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:21,694
How long have you been waiting here?

403
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:33,694
I didn't know you would
really refuse to come.

404
00:46:33,695 --> 00:46:37,737
I was surprised today.

405
00:46:39,694 --> 00:46:42,529
I'm sorry.

406
00:46:45,694 --> 00:46:49,694
I still don't understand.

407
00:46:49,694 --> 00:46:56,694
Although we didn't love each other,
we liked and respected each other.

408
00:46:56,694 --> 00:47:02,694
We had a common goal and similar values.

409
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:09,778
We were on the same track.

410
00:47:09,778 --> 00:47:13,613
But, I can't accept the fact that

411
00:47:13,613 --> 00:47:23,694
you got off the track and left me
for a mere palace attendant.

412
00:47:23,694 --> 00:47:29,694
You'll understand me one day.

413
00:47:29,694 --> 00:47:33,694
Do you think you'll be okay?

414
00:47:33,694 --> 00:47:36,862
Your father hasn't given up yet.

415
00:47:36,862 --> 00:47:41,694
Do you think the people around
you will gladly accept your decision?

416
00:47:45,694 --> 00:47:50,862
You might've given your dream up, but not me.

417
00:47:50,862 --> 00:47:57,694
I still want to be the most
important woman in this country.

418
00:47:58,904 --> 00:48:02,694
Then, may I ask you for a
favor, Miss Saeryung?

419
00:48:07,487 --> 00:48:10,529
I didn't mean to eavesdrop,
but don't get any wrong ideas.

420
00:48:10,529 --> 00:48:18,654
You two are the ones who decided
to talk in front of my window.

421
00:48:18,654 --> 00:48:24,694
Maybe I'm saying this without
fully comprehending what you mean.

422
00:48:24,694 --> 00:48:31,862
If I should need your help,
Miss Saeryung, will you help me?

423
00:48:33,778 --> 00:48:36,694
What do you mean?

424
00:48:36,694 --> 00:48:39,820
I want to be Crown Prince.

425
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:45,446
And, in order to do that, I need your help.

426
00:49:34,778 --> 00:49:39,694
Welcome, Empress.

427
00:49:39,694 --> 00:49:41,737
Professor Alex?

428
00:49:43,694 --> 00:49:50,694
Professor Alexander... He's a new Royal
Academy instructor, Professor Alexander....

429
00:49:50,694 --> 00:49:54,694
- von Esterhazy.
- Professor von Esterhazy.

430
00:49:54,694 --> 00:49:58,694
We were spending time together because
he's interested in Korean culture.

431
00:49:58,694 --> 00:50:00,654
I see.

432
00:50:00,654 --> 00:50:06,362
I heard he's from Oxford as well,
but I guess you don't know each other

433
00:50:06,362 --> 00:50:08,360
seeing how awkward you are to see each other.

434
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:11,888
It would've been a great honor
for me if we had met before.

435
00:50:14,694 --> 00:50:16,694
Your Highness Empress Dowager.

436
00:50:16,694 --> 00:50:22,694
The new royal chinaware is here for
your consideration. What shall we do?

437
00:50:23,694 --> 00:50:26,029
Oh, that was supposed to be today?

438
00:50:26,029 --> 00:50:28,487
Oh, no.

439
00:50:28,487 --> 00:50:32,501
I can't tell my guest to leave so soon.

440
00:50:32,501 --> 00:50:37,737
Hm! Why don't you hang out with him?

441
00:50:37,737 --> 00:50:39,070
Pardon?

442
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:44,654
You can play Tuho together
and talk about your Oxford days.

443
00:50:44,654 --> 00:50:49,694
Professor Alexander,
the Empress will join you.

444
00:50:49,694 --> 00:50:51,487
Have fun.

445
00:50:51,487 --> 00:50:52,945
Mother.

446
00:50:52,945 --> 00:50:55,694
Then, I'm off.

447
00:50:55,694 --> 00:50:57,694
Mother!

448
00:51:33,862 --> 00:51:43,404
I knew I should talk to
you one of these days.

449
00:51:43,404 --> 00:51:47,693
I can't stand it when you're
so cold towards me.

450
00:51:47,693 --> 00:51:50,173
The Alex you know is no more.

451
00:51:51,471 --> 00:51:53,589
I gave myself away when you left me.

452
00:51:54,196 --> 00:51:59,168
I'm sorry for not calling, not
keeping my promise, everything.

453
00:51:59,168 --> 00:52:02,055
I thought you would call at least once.

454
00:52:02,055 --> 00:52:06,106
You would never know how
painful it is... just to wait.

455
00:52:06,237 --> 00:52:11,694
I couldn't call.

456
00:52:11,694 --> 00:52:16,694
I can't be your wife and we
don't have a future together...

457
00:52:16,694 --> 00:52:19,778
So, how could I call you?

458
00:52:19,778 --> 00:52:23,571
What was I supposed to say?

459
00:52:23,571 --> 00:52:25,070
How's it going?

460
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:30,694
Or... just forget about me.

461
00:52:30,694 --> 00:52:34,694
I didn't want to listen to your voice.

462
00:52:34,694 --> 00:52:40,987
If I did, I was afraid I would disregard
everything and go running you.

463
00:52:40,987 --> 00:52:47,694
When we met last time,
you said I was cruel, right?

464
00:52:47,694 --> 00:52:52,694
I think it's even crueler that
you reappeared in my life.

465
00:53:03,694 --> 00:53:06,654
I'm sorry for interrupting you, Your Majesty.

466
00:53:06,654 --> 00:53:10,694
We have an emergency.

467
00:53:10,694 --> 00:53:14,694
The Prime Minister held a press conference

468
00:53:14,694 --> 00:53:17,694
calling for the selection of a Crown Prince.

469
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:25,737
The Royal Kinsmen are at the
lobby, requesting your audience.

470
00:53:25,737 --> 00:53:30,694
Even the Royal Kinsmen?

471
00:53:39,987 --> 00:53:42,904
Your Majesty is not safe anymore.

472
00:53:42,904 --> 00:53:47,694
Please install the Crown Prince right now!

473
00:53:47,694 --> 00:53:53,112
The Crown Prince will be
installed a year from now.

474
00:53:53,112 --> 00:53:59,694
I will not be bound by lineage,
but select someone who is qualified.

475
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:05,694
Until then, the two Princes will
need to prove their competence.

476
00:54:05,694 --> 00:54:09,694
A qualification test?

477
00:54:09,694 --> 00:54:14,029
Does Your Majesty intend
to stand by your word?

478
00:54:14,029 --> 00:54:18,694
An Empress does not lie.

479
00:54:18,694 --> 00:54:23,694
In order to stop me from
making an arbitrary decision,

480
00:54:23,694 --> 00:54:27,571
the decision will be made in the presence

481
00:54:27,571 --> 00:54:30,862
of the entire Imperial Court
and Royal Council.

482
00:54:30,862 --> 00:54:34,694
I will be objective and make

483
00:54:34,694 --> 00:54:43,321
a decision that the attendees
and the citizens will all agree upon.

484
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:50,029
I think this is the best solution
for now. Please accept it.

485
00:54:50,029 --> 00:54:56,694
I, too, respect your wise decision.

486
00:54:56,694 --> 00:55:02,694
But, leaving the seat of Crown
Prince empty for another year

487
00:55:02,694 --> 00:55:09,820
will pose a threat to your safety.

488
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:12,279
He's right.

489
00:55:12,279 --> 00:55:17,654
This matter is too urgent to wait a year.

490
00:55:23,694 --> 00:55:26,694
What about Your Majesty's 7th
anniversary of your enthronement?

491
00:55:26,694 --> 00:55:33,694
The installation of the Crown Prince
will add to the significance of the occasion.

492
00:55:33,694 --> 00:55:38,571
Let's do that then.

493
00:55:38,571 --> 00:55:40,987
I hereby announce

494
00:55:40,987 --> 00:55:49,070
that the Crown Prince will be installed on
the 7th anniversary of my enthronement.

495
00:55:51,987 --> 00:55:59,737
I'm surprised Her Majesty accepted
the Royal Kinsmen's proposal.

496
00:55:59,737 --> 00:56:01,694
Everyone knows that

497
00:56:01,694 --> 00:56:06,778
it's impossible to change Prince
Youngsung in such a short time.

498
00:56:06,778 --> 00:56:11,154
Maybe she has another plan in her mind.

499
00:56:11,154 --> 00:56:13,694
I don't know.

500
00:56:13,694 --> 00:56:21,694
We did pressure her, but I didn't know
she'd accept the proposal so willingly.

501
00:56:33,904 --> 00:56:35,694
Your Highness.

502
00:56:35,694 --> 00:56:38,694
Her Majesty requests your presence.

503
00:56:53,862 --> 00:56:55,362
Your Highness.

504
00:56:55,362 --> 00:56:59,654
Her Majesty requests your presence.

505
00:56:59,654 --> 00:57:01,694
I see.

506
00:57:43,694 --> 00:57:48,694
That's the promise I made
to the Royal Kinsmen.

507
00:57:48,694 --> 00:57:55,694
Like I said, your deadline is the 7th
anniversary of my enthronement.

508
00:57:55,694 --> 00:57:59,694
Until then, you two must do your
best to show your competence

509
00:57:59,694 --> 00:58:08,654
to the all the Royal Kin
and the rest of the people.

510
00:58:08,654 --> 00:58:12,694
And on that day,

511
00:58:12,694 --> 00:58:20,694
I will select he who is deemed
superior as Crown Prince.

512
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:26,778
Are you displeased with anything
I said, Prince Moonsung?

513
00:58:26,778 --> 00:58:31,945
How can I be displeased with
your appropriate measures?

514
00:58:31,945 --> 00:58:37,694
I will continue to be humble and do my best.

515
00:58:40,279 --> 00:58:42,404
What about you, Prince Youngsung?

516
00:58:42,404 --> 00:58:44,904
Are you dissatisfied with anything I said?

517
00:58:44,904 --> 00:58:52,694
I think the Royal Kinsmen are right
about choosing a successor soon.

518
00:58:52,694 --> 00:58:57,154
Although I don't have much
time, I will do my best.

519
00:59:00,694 --> 00:59:08,362
The two Princes, arise and prepare
to accept the royal order.

520
00:59:15,778 --> 00:59:18,654
Listen to me.

521
00:59:18,654 --> 00:59:26,694
You two have accepted my proposal on
which the future of this country depends.

522
00:59:26,694 --> 00:59:35,927
You two will complete fairly for
the title of Crown Prince,

523
00:59:35,927 --> 00:59:40,529
and you will be judged fairly
according to your abilities.

524
00:59:40,529 --> 00:59:45,694
You two must compete with goodwill.

525
00:59:45,694 --> 00:59:46,694
And, at the same time,

526
00:59:46,694 --> 00:59:51,694
the purpose of this competition
is not to beat the other person,

527
00:59:51,694 --> 00:59:56,694
but to further develop oneself.
Keep in mind this.

528
00:59:56,694 --> 01:00:06,321
I will wager the future of
this country on you two Princes.

529
01:00:06,321 --> 01:00:09,694
Can I do that?

530
01:00:09,694 --> 01:00:13,694
Yes, Your Majesty.

531
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:56,470
[Prince Hours]

532
01:00:57,470 --> 01:01:00,470
I'm not Kang Hoo anymore. I'm Yi Hoo.

533
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:26,470
Whether it's for the position of Crown Prince
or Attendant Yang. I want us to play fairly.
