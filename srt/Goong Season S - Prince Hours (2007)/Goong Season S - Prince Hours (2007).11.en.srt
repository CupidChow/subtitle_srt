1
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:26,131
Princes Youngsung and Moonsung
have accepted my proposal.

2
00:00:26,131 --> 00:00:32,463
As it was formally announced, one
will be appointed as Crown Prince

3
00:00:32,463 --> 00:00:40,505
during my enthronement
commemoration ceremony.

4
00:00:40,547 --> 00:00:47,379
Your Majesty, for an evaluation, there
must be criteria. What will those be?

5
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:51,714
And, how will you evaluate them?

6
00:00:51,714 --> 00:00:54,600
The criteria will be as follows.

7
00:00:55,988 --> 00:01:00,159
On each of the Royal Academy's required
subjects of Literature, Martial Arts, Art,

8
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:07,809
Wisdom, Courage, and one more required
quality to be an heir to the throne, Virtue,

9
00:01:07,809 --> 00:01:11,705
an assignment will be given
at the appropriate time,

10
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:15,505
and the two Princes must
work to solve each one.

11
00:01:17,089 --> 00:01:21,379
And, who will choose those assignments?

12
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:26,379
I will choose the assignments myself.

13
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:29,630
Your Majesty, I must ask you a question.

14
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:34,839
I'm afraid they won't be judged fairly.

15
00:01:34,839 --> 00:01:38,379
Everyone knows you favor Prince Youngsung...

16
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:39,881
Prince Duksun!

17
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:42,379
Do you know what we're doing right now?

18
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:50,379
We're trying to figure out who the next
Emperor will be to lead the Imperial Court.

19
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:54,379
I can't believe you're accusing me of letting
my personal feelings take precedence

20
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:56,422
in an important matter like this!

21
00:01:56,422 --> 00:02:00,380
Can you insult the Imperial Court like this?

22
00:02:02,214 --> 00:02:04,547
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

23
00:02:04,589 --> 00:02:08,379
That's not what I meant.

24
00:02:08,422 --> 00:02:13,172
Then, I'd like to hear what you really meant.

25
00:02:13,172 --> 00:02:15,547
Your Majesty, what I mean is...

26
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,505
You don't have to worry about that.

27
00:02:20,505 --> 00:02:24,379
I know this meeting is not
a place for a woman like me,

28
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:34,380
but I begged Her Majesty to let me
attend so that I could take part.

29
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:38,379
Please be kind enough to let me speak

30
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:42,380
on behalf of the late Emperor Ikjo out of
concern for the future of this nation.

31
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,505
I'm honored, Your Highness.

32
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:52,214
I'm just baffled that we've
caused you so much concern.

33
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,964
That's right, Your Highness.

34
00:02:54,964 --> 00:02:59,379
This meeting feels even more
settled because we're

35
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,505
in the presence of the most authoritative
elder in the Imperial Court.

36
00:03:02,505 --> 00:03:05,379
We're honored, Your Highness.

37
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:08,379
Thank you for welcoming me.

38
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:18,797
But, I can't stand listening to you
question the Imperial Court's authority.

39
00:03:18,797 --> 00:03:21,379
Forgive me, Your Highness.

40
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:27,379
As I've said before, you don't
have to worry about that.

41
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:33,089
Her Majesty is determined to
make a fair evaluation.

42
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:35,379
She already selected Grand Prince Hyosung

43
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:38,379
and Grand Prince Hyojang
as witness-participants.

44
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:44,214
The two are free to check the evaluation
at any time during the process.

45
00:03:44,214 --> 00:03:47,379
And, when the two Princes
complete all of their assignments,

46
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:54,589
everyone here can come and see who prevails.

47
00:03:54,589 --> 00:03:59,379
That's what's going to happen.

48
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:09,463
I may be impatient, but may I ask
what the first assignment is?

49
00:04:09,547 --> 00:04:13,922
Of course.

50
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:17,839
The first assignment is Literature.

51
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:27,006
I will personally give the details to
Princes Youngsung and Moonsung later.

52
00:04:27,006 --> 00:04:31,379
Afterward, Grand Chamberlain will notify
Her Highness the Empress Dowager,

53
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:36,379
the witness-participants, and the royal kin.

54
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:43,463
We are in a position to decide on
the future of the Imperial Court.

55
00:04:43,463 --> 00:04:49,964
I'd like everyone to help me so that
we can make a wise decision.

56
00:04:49,964 --> 00:04:53,755
We are honored, Your Majesty.

57
00:05:09,228 --> 00:05:15,825
[Prince Hours]

58
00:05:27,422 --> 00:05:30,379
What are you looking at?

59
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:34,245
I was looking at that.

60
00:05:34,245 --> 00:05:36,715
[Royal Academy]

61
00:05:41,131 --> 00:05:43,379
So the competition has begun?

62
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:45,379
Yes.

63
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:50,379
But, I don't even know what that means.

64
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:06,379
Oh, I thought that said "etiquette."

65
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:09,379
It means "art," right?

66
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:14,256
Yes, you're right.

67
00:06:14,256 --> 00:06:20,422
I finally made up my mind to be Crown
Prince, but I don't even know the basics.

68
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,379
Maybe I'm just wasting my time.

69
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:24,379
Not at all.

70
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:28,672
If you read the Royal Academy Handbook,
you'll find out things like this immediately.

71
00:06:28,672 --> 00:06:30,422
The Royal Academy Handbook?

72
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:35,214
Yes, it's in the school office.

73
00:06:36,505 --> 00:06:39,379
Oh, I'll be late for class.

74
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:43,379
Thanks. See you later.

75
00:06:44,718 --> 00:06:46,544
No, really.

76
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:52,379
How can an aristocrat dance like this?

77
00:06:52,379 --> 00:07:01,922
Kyunghwan is such a disgrace to
all the aristocrats out there.

78
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,589
You're taking it easy.

79
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,630
Prince Youngsung is scared out of his wits.

80
00:07:06,672 --> 00:07:08,505
Really?

81
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,589
I wonder how he's doing.

82
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:14,672
I don't get it.

83
00:07:14,672 --> 00:07:18,379
What kind of person is he?

84
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:23,379
He sometimes seems like a much greater
person than I give him credit for.

85
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:27,714
Other times, he seems more
pathetic than I thought.

86
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:30,797
That's his merit.

87
00:07:30,797 --> 00:07:39,379
He can turn either pathetic or great
depending on where his future leads.

88
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:42,379
He's different from people like us
who've already been trained.

89
00:07:42,698 --> 00:07:44,790
This can't be a fair contest.

90
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:48,989
Literature, of course, will go to the one
who's well-read and well-educated.

91
00:07:48,989 --> 00:07:50,098
so Moonsung is superior!

92
00:07:50,098 --> 00:07:58,108
As for the martial arts, Hoo is only a street
fighter, so Prince Moonsung is superior!

93
00:07:58,108 --> 00:08:02,012
In the Arts, of course, there's no
room for debate. Only...

94
00:08:02,825 --> 00:08:10,395
Wits? I don't know...
Hoo has nothing but cleverness?

95
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,434
Then what about Valor?

96
00:08:14,434 --> 00:08:16,466
He does seem to have courage.

97
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:22,167
That video clip where he takes his
clothes off in front of the camera...

98
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:24,690
Courage is to determined by the
willingness to put the country

99
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,103
and the Imperial Court ahead of oneself.

100
00:08:27,103 --> 00:08:28,884
It has nothing to do with the video clip.

101
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:33,691
Then, even that one cant be given to Hoo?
I was going to let him win that one...

102
00:08:47,349 --> 00:08:49,883
Keep your mouths shut, okay?

103
00:08:50,657 --> 00:08:52,849
Can the Empress be impartial?

104
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:58,134
Please don't worry about that.
She's in a different class than we are.

105
00:08:59,441 --> 00:09:00,886
What do you mean by that?

106
00:09:02,121 --> 00:09:08,026
The Empress is maybe too honest,
to the point of hurting herself at times.

107
00:09:09,004 --> 00:09:12,555
If that's the case, that's fortunate...

108
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:17,613
Anyhow, Joon said he'd do this on his own.

109
00:09:17,613 --> 00:09:20,417
And, if we tried to help in any way,
I worry he'll become rebellious.

110
00:09:21,867 --> 00:09:24,038
However, we can't just sit here...

111
00:09:24,038 --> 00:09:30,167
What a fool! He has no
idea how this world works.

112
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:37,725
He shouldn't be so stubborn.
Hm! But, it can't be helped.

113
00:09:37,725 --> 00:09:41,410
Sometimes going backward can
lead you to unexpected fortune.

114
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:48,139
The situation isn't all bad. Not at all...

115
00:09:50,068 --> 00:09:56,068
There's no way out now.

116
00:09:56,068 --> 00:09:59,903
Do you think Prince Youngsung can make it?

117
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:03,361
Faith is the greatest encouragement
you can give someone.

118
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:08,570
We need to have faith in the Prince.

119
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:14,861
Have you decided on what
the first assignment will be?

120
00:10:14,861 --> 00:10:17,903
I have something in mind.

121
00:10:17,903 --> 00:10:21,068
Oh, really?

122
00:10:21,068 --> 00:10:24,152
What is it?

123
00:10:24,152 --> 00:10:29,236
Even if you're my mother,
I still can't tell you beforehand.

124
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:32,611
Oh, come on. You can tell me.

125
00:10:32,653 --> 00:10:34,653
Mother.

126
00:10:34,653 --> 00:10:36,528
No, I understand.

127
00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:40,736
It's my fault for asking.

128
00:10:40,736 --> 00:10:46,903
I hope it's not too hard.

129
00:11:12,068 --> 00:11:14,653
You've improved.

130
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:16,111
I still have a long way to go.

131
00:11:16,111 --> 00:11:19,068
They say heaven helps those
who help themselves.

132
00:11:19,068 --> 00:11:23,068
I guess that's true.

133
00:11:23,068 --> 00:11:25,403
Shall we have a duel?

134
00:11:25,403 --> 00:11:30,778
We'll eventually have to,
regardless of what we want.

135
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:33,069
Then...

136
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:38,528
He has improved a lot, don't you think?

137
00:11:38,653 --> 00:11:41,068
Yes, he has, Your Highness.

138
00:12:11,403 --> 00:12:14,987
The embroidery crew will
work on this room today.

139
00:12:14,987 --> 00:12:18,068
Is your bed uncomfortable?

140
00:12:18,068 --> 00:12:22,361
No, it's fine.

141
00:12:22,361 --> 00:12:26,068
If you don't have any tasks
for me, may I leave?

142
00:12:26,068 --> 00:12:31,028
Sure, you can get back to work.

143
00:12:31,028 --> 00:12:34,068
Then...

144
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:02,068
Since the old days,

145
00:13:02,068 --> 00:13:08,278
the palace attendants have been trained
to be well-versed in palace etiquette.

146
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:11,068
Court calligraphy is part of such training.

147
00:13:11,068 --> 00:13:17,068
Can someone tell me why
we study court calligraphy?

148
00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:23,403
Tell me, Attendant Yang.

149
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:27,068
Pardon?

150
00:13:27,068 --> 00:13:32,068
Why are we studying court calligraphy?

151
00:13:32,068 --> 00:13:39,987
Uh... so, court calligraphy was used by
the palace attendants in the old times.

152
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:44,820
Pay attention!

153
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,987
Forgive me.

154
00:13:47,987 --> 00:13:52,068
Court calligraphy is selfless writing.

155
00:13:52,068 --> 00:13:54,068
It was training to become selfless,

156
00:13:54,068 --> 00:14:02,068
so that one can sincerely
be loyal to one's superior.

157
00:14:02,068 --> 00:14:10,111
Each stroke must be written with
utmost respect for your superior.

158
00:14:10,111 --> 00:14:16,236
You must study court calligraphy to
continue the old palace attendants' legacy.

159
00:14:16,236 --> 00:14:17,945
Understand?

160
00:14:17,945 --> 00:14:20,068
Yes, we understand.

161
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:28,068
Once again, a palace attendant
doesn't have individuality.

162
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:37,068
The only things expected from you are
sacrifice and service to the Royal Family.

163
00:14:49,003 --> 00:14:52,825
Stop reading! You'll become a corpse
before entering the academy!

164
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:53,775
Give it back to me.

165
00:14:53,775 --> 00:14:56,240
What's wrong with you
lately? You don't talk.

166
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,000
You're like a different person
studying all the time!

167
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,759
And, last night you had a nosebleed!

168
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:04,456
When we're eating, let's just eat, huh?

169
00:15:04,456 --> 00:15:08,024
Attendant Yang, stop being so snobbish!

170
00:15:08,024 --> 00:15:12,246
From what I hear, you got a good score
on the court attendant exam?

171
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:15,575
However, that's no guarantee you'll pass.

172
00:15:16,591 --> 00:15:19,310
They say the Academy's admissions test is
more difficult to pass than the bar exam.

173
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,035
So, how are you going to pass that?

174
00:15:21,035 --> 00:15:22,819
I will and must get in.

175
00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:31,736
Why are you so jealous? I heard you
tried 7 times and failed all 7 times?

176
00:15:31,872 --> 00:15:35,247
I had no luck!

177
00:15:35,247 --> 00:15:39,288
Do you know what my IQ is?
It's 150 and I'm a member of MENSA!

178
00:15:39,288 --> 00:15:43,302
Even a genius like me can't get in, so do you
think anyone can be a student court lady?

179
00:15:43,302 --> 00:15:45,018
No way!

180
00:15:48,421 --> 00:15:55,801
No... what I meant to say...
is... keep working hard.

181
00:15:55,974 --> 00:15:56,959
That's how you really feel?

182
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,239
Of course!

183
00:16:01,531 --> 00:16:05,060
Lately, Prince Youngsung seems different.
He seems like a completely different person.

184
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,260
You're not saying...
Could he be in love perhaps?

185
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,784
They say men become more
manly when they're in love.

186
00:16:11,784 --> 00:16:12,480
With whom?

187
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:15,463
You know, the girl who's his study buddy...

188
00:16:15,463 --> 00:16:19,504
Ah, I did hear from a Tae An Hall
court lady that the Empress Dowager

189
00:16:19,504 --> 00:16:21,488
is looking from among
the daughters of nobility.

190
00:16:21,488 --> 00:16:23,114
- Really?
- Uh huh.

191
00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:25,582
Oh, my! Then, does that mean
he'll be marrying soon?

192
00:16:25,582 --> 00:16:26,082
- Could that be it?
- Could that be it?

193
00:16:35,543 --> 00:16:41,015
I have to help with Prince
Moonsung's response letters.

194
00:16:45,945 --> 00:16:49,249
Loss of energy, loss of
motivation, loss of vigor...

195
00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:51,738
She's in complete broken-heart
mode... Am I right?

196
00:16:51,738 --> 00:16:53,229
That is not it!!

197
00:17:01,851 --> 00:17:04,219
Maintaining the fan club has
become an important daily duty.

198
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:14,632
Lately... you seem run down.

199
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,597
Why is that?

200
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:21,495
You look haggard... like really haggard.

201
00:17:23,128 --> 00:17:24,488
I do?

202
00:17:25,674 --> 00:17:29,529
How shall I say... It seems
like a loss of motivation also.

203
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:35,210
That's not it. I've been studying
very hard for the test...

204
00:17:42,275 --> 00:17:45,252
This isn't urgent, so let's take a break.

205
00:17:52,747 --> 00:17:55,241
Why do you want to go
to the Academy so badly?

206
00:17:57,719 --> 00:18:02,371
It's a privilege given only to
Imperial eunuchs or court ladies.

207
00:18:03,287 --> 00:18:11,983
It's the only way someone who isn't a royal
or an aristocrat to gain admission...

208
00:18:11,983 --> 00:18:17,138
Then, did you always have the Academy in
mind from when you first entered the palace?

209
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:19,767
It wasn't when I first entered.

210
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:26,235
While working in the palace, I came to the
realization that to my job even better,

211
00:18:26,235 --> 00:18:27,960
I needed to take the courses at the Academy.

212
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,234
What is it you would like to do?

213
00:18:31,538 --> 00:18:36,486
I want to work for Her Majesty...
like Madame Chamberlain.

214
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,582
You do?

215
00:18:38,582 --> 00:18:45,844
First, my goal is to get into the Academy.
After that, I'll think about what to do.

216
00:18:45,844 --> 00:18:48,376
But, I'm not going to
put a limit to my goals.

217
00:18:48,376 --> 00:18:52,467
They say, "The sky's the limit,"
when it comes to your dreams.

218
00:18:56,747 --> 00:18:59,103
What are your dreams, Your Highness?

219
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:07,840
Dreams? Now come to think of it,
I've never thought about my dreams.

220
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:16,733
Royals are born into privilege and honor.
The tradeoff is having no personal freedom.

221
00:19:18,562 --> 00:19:22,560
And, of course, personal
dreams are not allowed.

222
00:19:27,611 --> 00:19:29,805
But, I do have a dream now.

223
00:19:31,354 --> 00:19:37,600
I do. I do have a dream. I found my dream.

224
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:47,274
[Prince Hours]

225
00:19:57,435 --> 00:20:01,395
I'm sorry to keep Your Highnesses waiting.

226
00:20:01,395 --> 00:20:09,435
Her Majesty will now personally
deliver your first assignment.

227
00:20:09,478 --> 00:20:13,435
Please follow me.

228
00:20:19,603 --> 00:20:20,978
Lady Han.

229
00:20:20,978 --> 00:20:23,519
Yes, Your Majesty.

230
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:51,435
Do you know what this is?

231
00:20:56,686 --> 00:20:58,395
What is it?

232
00:20:58,395 --> 00:21:00,811
It's "Gunsangokdo."

233
00:21:00,811 --> 00:21:04,435
That's right.

234
00:21:04,435 --> 00:21:06,062
Prince Youngsung.

235
00:21:06,062 --> 00:21:11,270
May I take a look at the royal wedding
ring you always carry with you?

236
00:21:14,478 --> 00:21:20,435
Uh... I left it in my room for safekeeping.

237
00:21:20,435 --> 00:21:22,228
I see.

238
00:21:22,228 --> 00:21:27,145
Do you remember what
was written on that ring?

239
00:21:27,145 --> 00:21:30,270
"Let's think of each other
whenever the wind blows."

240
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,728
Right.

241
00:21:31,728 --> 00:21:39,478
Those words were taken from
the last verse of this poem.

242
00:21:40,645 --> 00:21:46,435
When the late Emperor Ikjo was on the throne,

243
00:21:46,435 --> 00:21:52,435
he ordered "Gunsangokdo" to be drawn

244
00:21:52,435 --> 00:21:59,435
and the three exact rings to be made
with the last verse engraved on them.

245
00:21:59,435 --> 00:22:04,435
Then, he handed the rings out
to his cousins to be used

246
00:22:04,435 --> 00:22:07,686
as royal wedding rings.

247
00:22:07,686 --> 00:22:14,435
Your ring is one of them.

248
00:22:14,435 --> 00:22:23,395
However, as you can see,
"Gunsangokdo" is in horrible condition.

249
00:22:23,395 --> 00:22:25,435
How did this happen?

250
00:22:25,435 --> 00:22:32,435
Do you remember the flood from the
Han River a few summers back?

251
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:38,728
Sunwoon Tower, where this
picture was kept, was flooded.

252
00:22:38,728 --> 00:22:50,895
Several artifacts have been restored
since then, but not this picture.

253
00:22:50,895 --> 00:22:56,435
There's a good reason why.

254
00:22:56,435 --> 00:23:04,435
I'm sure you two have guessed
what the first assignment is by now.

255
00:23:04,435 --> 00:23:11,435
Grand Chamberlain and Lady Han
will give you the specific guidelines.

256
00:23:11,435 --> 00:23:19,435
I expect you two to do your
best on your first assignment.

257
00:23:19,435 --> 00:23:32,853
Remember, your everyday life
is also going to be evaluated.

258
00:23:32,853 --> 00:23:35,354
Do you have any questions?

259
00:23:35,354 --> 00:23:43,435
No, I will do my best to get
the results that you want.

260
00:23:43,435 --> 00:23:47,811
I'll do my best.

261
00:23:47,811 --> 00:23:52,728
This place is open to you two
while you do your assignment.

262
00:23:52,728 --> 00:23:56,270
You may come here whenever
you wish to see the painting,

263
00:23:56,270 --> 00:24:04,354
and read books to help
you with the assignment.

264
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:25,478
I can't figure out what this means.

265
00:24:25,478 --> 00:24:29,435
I think I can figure out the picture though.

266
00:24:29,435 --> 00:24:34,435
This is a poem about love
between a man and woman.

267
00:24:34,435 --> 00:24:39,978
I think it's a poem written by
a woman who misses her man.

268
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:44,312
That's called boudoir lament poetry.

269
00:24:44,312 --> 00:24:50,062
I will give you a free
interpretation of this poem.

270
00:24:50,062 --> 00:24:55,103
"I want to give you something
while yearning for you,"

271
00:24:55,103 --> 00:25:00,312
"but all I have is a bamboo fan to give you."

272
00:25:00,312 --> 00:25:05,770
"When the clear wind blows between the fan,"

273
00:25:05,853 --> 00:25:12,435
"let's think of each other
whenever the wind blows."

274
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:18,435
So that's what it means.

275
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:23,645
The problem is there are two
people who worked on this picture.

276
00:25:23,645 --> 00:25:32,435
The artist and writer are two different
people, but they're like enemies.

277
00:25:32,435 --> 00:25:36,435
Both of them firmly refused
to restore this work.

278
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:41,811
Even the Imperial Court gave
up on involving both of them.

279
00:25:41,811 --> 00:25:44,853
Our assignment is to convince

280
00:25:44,853 --> 00:25:49,770
at least one of them to start
the restoration project.

281
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:52,561
That'll be hard.

282
00:25:52,561 --> 00:25:54,435
According to the guidelines,

283
00:25:54,435 --> 00:25:57,645
we can take on the writing
and painting separately.

284
00:25:57,645 --> 00:26:03,020
Prince Youngsung, which one will you choose?

285
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:07,895
I think I'll go with the painting.

286
00:26:07,895 --> 00:26:11,187
Then, I'll go with the writing.

287
00:26:11,187 --> 00:26:14,435
So, I guess we're really starting now?

288
00:26:14,435 --> 00:26:18,937
It appears so.

289
00:26:33,435 --> 00:26:35,435
You chose the painting?

290
00:26:35,435 --> 00:26:38,853
Yes.

291
00:26:38,853 --> 00:26:41,435
In an artwork like that,
it's the meaning that counts.

292
00:26:41,435 --> 00:26:43,435
So, the writing is more important.

293
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:48,435
All I have to do is convince the artisan
before Prince Moonsung does.

294
00:26:48,435 --> 00:26:51,478
I've never heard of Master Yangjoo,

295
00:26:51,478 --> 00:26:57,603
but Master Byuksoo is notorious
for having a strict personality.

296
00:26:57,603 --> 00:27:00,435
Really?

297
00:27:18,356 --> 00:27:22,890
[Reference Books / Encyclopedias]

298
00:27:49,436 --> 00:27:51,770
It's this way, Your Highness.

299
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,435
Okay.

300
00:28:29,436 --> 00:28:34,435
I heard you're studying for the
Royal Academy entrance exam.

301
00:28:34,435 --> 00:28:36,603
Yes.

302
00:28:36,603 --> 00:28:39,435
I hope you make it.

303
00:28:39,435 --> 00:28:43,728
You may be able to apply,
but it's hard to get accepted.

304
00:28:43,728 --> 00:28:48,435
I commend you for giving it a try.

305
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,519
Yes, I'm going to try hard.

306
00:28:51,645 --> 00:28:57,435
I hope I get to meet you
at the Royal Academy.

307
00:28:58,686 --> 00:29:01,436
I lost someone dear to me because of you.

308
00:29:01,436 --> 00:29:06,895
So, try to understand if
I'm unfriendly to you.

309
00:29:06,895 --> 00:29:10,435
What kind of person are you?

310
00:29:10,435 --> 00:29:13,436
Pardon?

311
00:29:13,436 --> 00:29:17,435
I sometimes wonder who you really are.

312
00:29:17,435 --> 00:29:22,312
Who are you that you get
on my nerves this much?

313
00:29:22,312 --> 00:29:23,519
I don't know what you're talking about.

314
00:29:23,686 --> 00:29:25,228
You don't have to know.

315
00:29:25,228 --> 00:29:29,062
It's personal.

316
00:29:29,062 --> 00:29:32,937
It seems as though you and Prince Youngsung
have settled your affairs

317
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,435
and decided to be just Prince
and court attendant.

318
00:29:35,435 --> 00:29:38,435
I like that.

319
00:29:38,435 --> 00:29:41,435
- Are you that unconfident?
- What?

320
00:29:41,435 --> 00:29:45,020
Why are you always bothered by me?

321
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:52,770
Maybe that means you're not confident about
your feelings toward Prince Youngsung.

322
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:56,103
You no longer have to be concerned about me.

323
00:29:56,103 --> 00:29:58,312
I know where I stand.

324
00:29:58,312 --> 00:30:01,435
What?

325
00:30:08,435 --> 00:30:13,228
Why is she always picking on me?

326
00:30:22,853 --> 00:30:26,978
You and Prince Youngsung
seem to be getting along.

327
00:30:26,978 --> 00:30:31,435
You look cheerful around him.

328
00:30:31,435 --> 00:30:34,478
Are things working out between
you and Attendant Yang?

329
00:30:34,728 --> 00:30:38,853
No, not yet.

330
00:30:38,853 --> 00:30:40,770
I don't think she's interested in me.

331
00:30:40,895 --> 00:30:43,435
I think I'm the only one who's into her.

332
00:30:43,435 --> 00:30:46,395
Don't put it that way.

333
00:30:46,395 --> 00:30:50,561
You're making me even more miserable.

334
00:30:50,561 --> 00:30:54,519
I'm still going to try to be Crown Prince.

335
00:30:54,519 --> 00:31:01,978
I'm going to fight on my own so I
can be proud of myself before her.

336
00:31:01,978 --> 00:31:05,435
We're not on the same boat anymore.

337
00:31:05,435 --> 00:31:11,435
But, I don't want to stand on
the opposite side of you.

338
00:31:11,435 --> 00:31:15,435
The opposite side?

339
00:31:15,435 --> 00:31:18,145
We didn't get on the same boat,

340
00:31:18,145 --> 00:31:21,436
but we can be a lighthouse to
each other from time to time.

341
00:31:21,436 --> 00:31:25,435
I hope so.

342
00:31:32,435 --> 00:31:36,020
You said you can do it on your own.

343
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:40,645
Can you stand by your word?

344
00:31:40,686 --> 00:31:43,603
Yes.

345
00:31:43,603 --> 00:31:47,895
Many people will be watching you.

346
00:31:47,895 --> 00:31:51,895
You need to hit him hard from the beginning.

347
00:31:51,895 --> 00:31:53,645
I'll take care of it on my own.

348
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:56,686
Leave it to me.

349
00:31:56,686 --> 00:32:02,312
If you can do it right,
I won't have to interfere.

350
00:32:02,312 --> 00:32:08,435
Regardless, I'm glad you
took the writing part.

351
00:32:08,436 --> 00:32:10,853
That's a good place to start.

352
00:32:10,853 --> 00:32:14,435
I have a good feeling about this.

353
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:19,435
It's been so long since
I last cooked for you.

354
00:32:19,435 --> 00:32:24,645
I'm sure they feed you well at the palace,
but nothing beats a mother's cooking.

355
00:32:26,435 --> 00:32:29,435
Thank you.

356
00:32:31,435 --> 00:32:32,435
Aren't you going to eat?

357
00:32:32,435 --> 00:32:36,312
I already ate. Help yourself.

358
00:32:38,811 --> 00:32:45,435
It's been so long since I last saw you eat.

359
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:58,062
I'm sorry about the engagement...

360
00:32:58,062 --> 00:32:59,435
Joon.

361
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:08,020
The Deputy Prime Minister is still
angry, but we can convince him

362
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:15,435
because he needs your father's
help to be the next Prime Minister.

363
00:33:15,435 --> 00:33:21,435
Why don't you work things out with Saeryung?

364
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:32,937
You always told me that you
trusted me, but you never did.

365
00:33:32,937 --> 00:33:36,435
You always needed my father
around to feel secure.

366
00:33:36,435 --> 00:33:40,519
No, I trust you.

367
00:33:40,645 --> 00:33:45,435
You never trusted anyone.

368
00:33:45,435 --> 00:33:51,895
Trusting someone requires courage.

369
00:33:51,895 --> 00:33:56,103
You don't have that courage.

370
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:02,435
Bye, I have to go back to the palace.

371
00:34:38,145 --> 00:34:41,228
Remember, we decided to play fairly.

372
00:34:41,228 --> 00:34:44,145
Of course. Good luck.

373
00:34:44,145 --> 00:34:48,435
Same to you.

374
00:35:06,435 --> 00:35:08,811
Welcome, Your Highness.

375
00:35:08,811 --> 00:35:11,436
Hello, Master.

376
00:35:11,478 --> 00:35:13,728
Come in.

377
00:35:25,645 --> 00:35:27,728
Here you go.

378
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:47,435
I don't understand why an artisan who

379
00:35:47,435 --> 00:35:51,145
can restore a cultural asset would
turn down the Imperial Court's order.

380
00:35:51,145 --> 00:35:54,435
It's been many years since
I last restored artwork.

381
00:35:54,435 --> 00:36:00,435
I just spend my time collecting
my old master's works.

382
00:36:00,435 --> 00:36:02,895
It's been a long time since I quit working.

383
00:36:02,895 --> 00:36:07,270
I know I should follow
the Imperial Court's order,

384
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:09,728
but I'm not competent enough for the job.

385
00:36:09,728 --> 00:36:13,435
Please don't ask me anymore.

386
00:36:13,435 --> 00:36:18,435
"Gunsangokdo" is your last piece of work.

387
00:36:18,435 --> 00:36:19,895
I learned that an artisan's work
is not done by craftsmanship,

388
00:36:19,895 --> 00:36:22,853
but through his soul.

389
00:36:22,853 --> 00:36:28,435
Please reconsider restoring it.

390
00:36:33,435 --> 00:36:37,770
I guess you didn't pour
your soul into that work.

391
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:40,435
How much do you know about "Gunsangokdo"?

392
00:36:40,435 --> 00:36:42,645
I know it's an important
treasure of the Imperial Court,

393
00:36:42,645 --> 00:36:52,645
that it's your last piece of work, and it
was damaged because of the flood.

394
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:56,435
I didn't make that by myself.

395
00:36:56,435 --> 00:37:02,435
"Gunsangokdo" is meaningless if the drawing
and writing are not joined together.

396
00:37:02,435 --> 00:37:09,728
If both parts are not restored,
you can't call it "Gunsangokdo."

397
00:37:15,435 --> 00:37:21,435
What would you do if two of
your kids are drowning in water?

398
00:37:21,478 --> 00:37:26,645
Let's suppose that two kids are
drifting in opposite directions.

399
00:37:26,686 --> 00:37:30,561
Would you give up on both of them?

400
00:37:30,561 --> 00:37:35,435
Or, save at least one?

401
00:37:40,478 --> 00:37:43,435
I will get going now.

402
00:37:48,853 --> 00:37:53,062
Master, please.

403
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:56,811
Please restore the work.

404
00:37:56,811 --> 00:37:59,895
Please just go back.

405
00:37:59,895 --> 00:38:05,435
It's been a long time since
I thought about that work.

406
00:38:05,435 --> 00:38:14,895
Joongsan, please escort His Highness outside.

407
00:38:14,895 --> 00:38:21,811
Have a safe trip back, and don't come
here again to ask me about the picture.

408
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:45,435
Goodbye.

409
00:38:46,686 --> 00:38:52,978
Can I ask you a question
I couldn't ask the Master?

410
00:38:52,978 --> 00:38:55,062
What is it?

411
00:38:55,062 --> 00:38:58,435
Do you know the reason

412
00:38:58,435 --> 00:39:02,187
why Masters Byuksoo and Yangjoo
became hostile toward each other?

413
00:39:02,187 --> 00:39:04,001
That's because...

414
00:39:13,344 --> 00:39:17,435
Two people have lost their lives
because of Master Yangjoo.

415
00:39:17,435 --> 00:39:20,062
What do you mean?

416
00:39:20,062 --> 00:39:22,895
The two artisans studied
under the same master.

417
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,435
Yes, I know.

418
00:39:25,435 --> 00:39:31,435
Their teacher, Master Mooyoung,
had a daughter named Hyeran.

419
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:38,519
She had a crush on Master Yangjoo
and confessed that to him, but he declined.

420
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:44,561
She then committed suicide out of grief.

421
00:39:44,561 --> 00:39:46,978
Master Mooyoung was sick in bed at the time.

422
00:39:46,978 --> 00:39:51,519
He died from shock after losing his daughter.

423
00:39:53,561 --> 00:39:57,435
You can say that's when the two
stopped talking to each other.

424
00:39:57,435 --> 00:40:01,435
Master Yangjoo was expelled from
Master Mooyoung's school.

425
00:40:01,561 --> 00:40:06,354
They probably never saw
each other since then.

426
00:40:09,435 --> 00:40:11,937
Both of the Princes failed?

427
00:40:11,937 --> 00:40:14,770
Yes, Your Highness.

428
00:40:17,435 --> 00:40:23,728
The two young Princes can't convince
the most stubborn men out there.

429
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:27,435
This isn't a matter to laugh about.

430
00:40:27,435 --> 00:40:29,519
The seat of Crown Prince is at stake.

431
00:40:29,645 --> 00:40:32,435
We can't gain anything by being anxious.

432
00:40:32,435 --> 00:40:36,603
Are you just going to sit here and watch?

433
00:40:36,728 --> 00:40:38,435
Did you get it?

434
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:40,435
Yes, Your Highness.

435
00:40:50,354 --> 00:40:58,895
This is a work by Master Mooyoung,
the two artisans' teacher.

436
00:40:58,895 --> 00:41:01,937
Where did you find this?

437
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,354
Master Mooyoung burned all
his of work before he died!

438
00:41:05,354 --> 00:41:07,978
That's right.

439
00:41:07,978 --> 00:41:11,519
That's why he's a legend.

440
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:14,435
But, he couldn't get rid of his works

441
00:41:14,435 --> 00:41:19,435
that were already in other
people's possession.

442
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:26,187
I heard Master Yangjoo is obsessed
with collecting his master's work.

443
00:41:26,187 --> 00:41:31,435
A stubborn man on the outside
can be very weak on the inside.

444
00:41:31,435 --> 00:41:35,686
Who knows what's hidden in his heart?

445
00:41:48,561 --> 00:41:50,435
The Grand Prince said

446
00:41:50,435 --> 00:41:57,395
something this important should be in
the possession of someone worthy of it.

447
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:07,435
A benevolent man is good-natured,
but is also wicked.

448
00:42:11,435 --> 00:42:16,561
Only the merciful can love and
hate another person.

449
00:42:16,561 --> 00:42:20,436
I'll ask you a question from the Analects.

450
00:42:20,436 --> 00:42:29,436
What did Confucius say when
Yan Hui asked him about virtue?

451
00:42:29,561 --> 00:42:34,978
When Yan Hui asked Confucius
about virtue, he replied,

452
00:42:34,978 --> 00:42:38,435
"Virtue is to overcome oneself
and turn back to civility."

453
00:42:38,435 --> 00:42:43,228
"If you turn back to civility,
the world will turn back to virtue."

454
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:45,354
That's correct.

455
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:49,103
"Overcome oneself and turn back to civility."

456
00:42:49,103 --> 00:42:52,228
"Overcome oneself and turn back to civility."

457
00:42:52,228 --> 00:42:55,435
It means you should do away with
selfishness and follow what's right.

458
00:42:55,435 --> 00:42:58,937
What's the basis for determining
whether something is right or wrong?

459
00:42:58,937 --> 00:43:01,435
Everyone thinks differently.

460
00:43:01,435 --> 00:43:04,978
How can we say what's right or wrong?

461
00:43:04,978 --> 00:43:08,435
That's what wisdom is.

462
00:43:08,435 --> 00:43:14,435
The reason why Your Highness is
studying now is to obtain wisdom.

463
00:43:33,686 --> 00:43:37,435
Since the two of you are very busy nowadays,

464
00:43:37,435 --> 00:43:40,645
we've prepared a healthy dish for you.

465
00:43:40,645 --> 00:43:44,728
First, we have eel to increase stamina.

466
00:43:44,728 --> 00:43:47,435
Then, a bamboo-sprout dish to clear
your head and purify your blood.

467
00:43:47,435 --> 00:43:49,686
We also have salmon steak
that Prince Moonsung likes

468
00:43:49,686 --> 00:43:52,435
and kimchi-dumpling casserole
which Prince Youngsung likes.

469
00:43:52,435 --> 00:43:56,519
To relieve your stress, we also have...

470
00:43:56,519 --> 00:44:00,435
Then, enjoy your meal...

471
00:44:00,435 --> 00:44:02,435
Good job today.

472
00:44:02,435 --> 00:44:05,435
The same goes for you.

473
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:12,435
We didn't make it today, but we
should try again tomorrow, right?

474
00:44:12,435 --> 00:44:14,603
Of course.

475
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:33,728
I'm going home.

476
00:44:33,728 --> 00:44:35,435
Bye.

477
00:44:35,435 --> 00:44:38,395
Hey, about Prince Youngsung...

478
00:44:38,395 --> 00:44:40,478
I can't even call him a troublemaker anymore.

479
00:44:40,478 --> 00:44:44,561
He's a completely different
person now. He's so cold.

480
00:44:44,561 --> 00:44:50,435
I don't know how he became so sharp.

481
00:44:50,435 --> 00:44:52,435
I'm going home.

482
00:44:52,435 --> 00:44:54,435
Bye.

483
00:45:34,435 --> 00:45:36,270
Yang Sooneui!

484
00:45:41,435 --> 00:45:44,354
Hold still.

485
00:45:44,354 --> 00:45:49,354
If you put your head back,
the blood will go down your throat.

486
00:45:49,354 --> 00:45:52,937
Sit here.

487
00:46:14,435 --> 00:46:16,435
How do you feel?

488
00:46:16,435 --> 00:46:21,519
I think the bleeding has stopped.

489
00:46:21,686 --> 00:46:25,435
I think I'm okay now.

490
00:46:25,435 --> 00:46:28,435
I'm sorry.

491
00:46:32,435 --> 00:46:36,435
Attendant Yang!

492
00:46:36,435 --> 00:46:39,435
Yes, Your Highness.

493
00:46:39,435 --> 00:46:45,435
Be careful. Don't work too hard.

494
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:48,728
Okay, Your Highness.

495
00:47:05,937 --> 00:47:09,435
You're still working?

496
00:47:11,478 --> 00:47:14,519
May I sit next to you?

497
00:47:19,435 --> 00:47:22,435
You've been working overtime lately.

498
00:47:22,435 --> 00:47:25,435
I have.

499
00:47:27,435 --> 00:47:31,728
Remember when I told you
that I'm a bad person?

500
00:47:31,728 --> 00:47:39,561
You said you have to get what you
want, but you want to get it fairly.

501
00:47:39,603 --> 00:47:44,435
I know that I can get
anything I want if I try.

502
00:47:44,435 --> 00:47:49,145
That's what kept me going until now.

503
00:47:49,145 --> 00:48:01,435
But, I don't know how to try
and whether I can get it even if I do.

504
00:48:01,435 --> 00:48:05,561
These days, it's a bit scary.

505
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:14,645
What can I do to win someone's heart?

506
00:48:17,435 --> 00:48:27,645
Ah... it was so hard trying to
change Master Yangjoo's mind.

507
00:48:27,645 --> 00:48:33,435
I think a person's heart is the
hardest thing to win in this world.

508
00:48:33,435 --> 00:48:36,435
If you persevere with sincerity,

509
00:48:36,435 --> 00:48:41,728
the other person will at least
know that you're being sincere.

510
00:48:41,728 --> 00:48:49,312
Are you telling me that I can win
a person's heart by being sincere?

511
00:48:51,686 --> 00:48:54,435
Attendant Yang.

512
00:48:54,435 --> 00:48:55,561
Yes, Your Highness.

513
00:48:55,645 --> 00:49:06,354
Are you hesitant to give me an answer
because you like someone else?

514
00:49:06,354 --> 00:49:07,770
Well...

515
00:49:09,478 --> 00:49:12,519
It's getting late.

516
00:49:23,728 --> 00:49:27,435
Thank you for the advice.

517
00:49:27,435 --> 00:49:33,435
As you said, I'll be sincere.

518
00:49:37,145 --> 00:49:40,395
Let's go!

519
00:50:01,435 --> 00:50:04,270
Congratulations. You finally beat me.

520
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:05,770
I was just lucky.

521
00:50:05,811 --> 00:50:07,435
You're too modest.

522
00:50:07,435 --> 00:50:12,728
I get so nervous whenever
I have a match with you.

523
00:50:15,089 --> 00:50:16,257
Yooncheol and Minhyuk.

524
00:50:16,257 --> 00:50:16,757
- Yes?
- Yeah?

525
00:50:19,178 --> 00:50:20,786
What can you see from this drawing?

526
00:50:23,686 --> 00:50:25,270
A duck.

527
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:26,978
A duck.

528
00:50:26,978 --> 00:50:28,435
A duck?

529
00:50:31,337 --> 00:50:35,394
How about you, Hoo?
What does it seem like to you?

530
00:50:35,853 --> 00:50:37,855
Isn't that a rabbit?

531
00:50:37,855 --> 00:50:41,130
What rabbit? It's a duck.

532
00:50:42,282 --> 00:50:44,331
It's a duck and rabbit at the same time.

533
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:49,604
If you see this part...
as a beak, then it's a duck.

534
00:50:49,604 --> 00:50:55,892
However, if you see this
as ears, then it's a rabbit.

535
00:50:56,728 --> 00:50:59,937
Oh, he's right. It's a rabbit.

536
00:50:59,937 --> 00:51:03,236
Now it looks like a duck to me.

537
00:51:03,236 --> 00:51:06,144
This is a good example of human nature.

538
00:51:07,779 --> 00:51:13,651
Generally, we think that mankind
is the species of rational thinking.

539
00:51:13,651 --> 00:51:21,022
In fact, we come to realize that
one only sees what he wants to see.

540
00:51:21,532 --> 00:51:28,158
Until he is exposed to more information,
his thoughts are quite judgmental.

541
00:51:30,895 --> 00:51:36,770
Duck, rabbit...

542
00:51:54,435 --> 00:51:56,395
What's this?

543
00:51:56,395 --> 00:52:00,228
It's a picture collection of Master
Byuksoo's old paintings and drawings.

544
00:52:00,228 --> 00:52:03,895
It should help you.

545
00:52:06,519 --> 00:52:08,228
Thank you, Miss Saeryung.

546
00:52:08,228 --> 00:52:09,561
Not at all.

547
00:52:09,603 --> 00:52:12,395
We're on the same team.

548
00:52:39,395 --> 00:52:41,435
You look pale.

549
00:52:41,435 --> 00:52:44,062
It must've been tough for you.

550
00:52:44,062 --> 00:52:47,395
I'm sorry about what happened last time.

551
00:52:47,395 --> 00:52:50,478
He shouldn't have done that to you.

552
00:52:50,519 --> 00:52:55,103
It's all in the past.

553
00:52:55,103 --> 00:53:04,435
Both the Grand Prince and I
don't think it's not over yet.

554
00:53:04,435 --> 00:53:12,187
Joon made a mistake, but can you try
to understand and wait for him?

555
00:53:12,187 --> 00:53:13,435
Duchess...

556
00:53:13,435 --> 00:53:17,853
You can call me "Mother" like you did before.

557
00:53:17,853 --> 00:53:22,435
I've known Joon for a long time.

558
00:53:22,435 --> 00:53:27,435
And I'm confident that I know him well.

559
00:53:27,435 --> 00:53:30,728
From what I know, he won't come back to me.

560
00:53:30,728 --> 00:53:32,103
Saeryung.

561
00:53:32,103 --> 00:53:34,853
Duchess...

562
00:53:34,853 --> 00:53:39,435
I'm over him.

563
00:53:43,435 --> 00:53:49,435
I can't believe you gave up on
your dream to be Empress.

564
00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:52,103
You gave up on Joon so easily...

565
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:55,561
Joon made me give up on him.

566
00:53:55,561 --> 00:54:02,435
Besides, I haven't given up on my dream.

567
00:54:02,435 --> 00:54:05,713
At least not yet.

568
00:54:05,713 --> 00:54:11,391
Yes. Ah, yes. Thank you.... just a minute.

569
00:54:11,944 --> 00:54:13,684
Your Highness...

570
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:19,720
Yes... Ah, hello.

571
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:23,675
Excuse me? The Master is?

572
00:54:25,135 --> 00:54:29,755
I was just on my way
over there anyway. Yes...

573
00:54:43,309 --> 00:54:45,891
Welcome, Your Highness.

574
00:54:45,891 --> 00:54:48,891
Yes, I heard you wanted to speak with me.

575
00:54:48,891 --> 00:54:50,434
That is so.

576
00:54:50,434 --> 00:54:52,891
Please come inside.

577
00:55:09,184 --> 00:55:12,891
By chance... did you change your mind?

578
00:55:19,891 --> 00:55:21,891
What... is this?

579
00:55:21,892 --> 00:55:27,184
This is my master's, Master
Moomyung's, last work.

580
00:55:28,891 --> 00:55:31,891
Your father gave me a very valuable gift,

581
00:55:31,891 --> 00:55:36,891
but I don't have a good reason to
accept this.

582
00:55:37,891 --> 00:55:40,684
My father?

583
00:55:42,184 --> 00:55:48,891
I never even dreamed of trying to convince
you with Master Mooyoung's final work.

584
00:55:48,891 --> 00:55:52,017
Forgive me if this has offended you.

585
00:55:55,142 --> 00:55:57,891
What I'm about to say has
nothing to do with this work.

586
00:55:57,891 --> 00:56:02,891
I'm not asking you this as the person
in charge of this restoration project,

587
00:56:02,891 --> 00:56:07,891
but as a member of the Korean
Imperial Court, that is, my family.

588
00:56:07,891 --> 00:56:11,891
"Gunsangokdo" is made with
the souls of you two artisans,

589
00:56:11,891 --> 00:56:16,726
but it also contains Emperor
Ikjo's sincere heart

590
00:56:16,726 --> 00:56:19,226
that cherished this work more than anyone.

591
00:56:19,226 --> 00:56:25,891
And that's part of the era and history
preserves the Imperial Court.

592
00:56:25,891 --> 00:56:28,547
If this work does not get restored properly,

593
00:56:28,547 --> 00:56:34,891
the Imperial Court will lose
a part of its history forever.

594
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:38,017
Please reconsider, Master.

595
00:56:47,891 --> 00:56:51,393
I will participate in the
restoration project.

596
00:56:56,891 --> 00:57:02,891
Excuse me, but may I ask
why you changed your mind?

597
00:57:02,891 --> 00:57:06,891
Everyone has his own life.

598
00:57:06,891 --> 00:57:08,891
So does a picture.

599
00:57:08,891 --> 00:57:12,891
It has a life of its own after
it leaves the artist's hands.

600
00:57:12,891 --> 00:57:16,891
When I heard that "Gunsangokdo"
was damaged from the flood,

601
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:20,226
I thought its life was over.

602
00:57:20,226 --> 00:57:25,267
The energy of us two
artisans was now deplete.

603
00:57:25,267 --> 00:57:30,643
But now that there's a new energy
and effort to restore this picture,

604
00:57:30,643 --> 00:57:37,891
I started to think that maybe
this picture's life isn't over yet.

605
00:57:46,017 --> 00:57:51,017
My mother kept a ring with the
words, "Let's think of each other

606
00:57:51,017 --> 00:57:54,891
whenever the wind blows"
with her until she died.

607
00:57:54,891 --> 00:57:57,891
Although it hasn't been long since
I found out what the ring meant,

608
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:00,975
I'll remember it for the rest of my life.

609
00:58:00,975 --> 00:58:05,393
I will never participate in
the restoration project.

610
00:58:05,393 --> 00:58:11,309
Please stop torturing me and go home.

611
00:58:11,309 --> 00:58:15,434
Everything has a fate of its own.

612
00:58:15,434 --> 00:58:21,891
If that painting was damaged, that's fate.

613
00:58:22,017 --> 00:58:25,434
Please don't come here anymore.

614
00:58:25,434 --> 00:58:28,434
Master!

615
00:58:46,184 --> 00:58:50,059
Uh... Your Highness?

616
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:52,891
Let's go.

617
00:58:52,891 --> 00:58:55,393
I don't think he'll say yes.

618
00:59:18,891 --> 00:59:21,891
Hello, Eunuch Chung... Yes.

619
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:24,810
What?

620
00:59:33,851 --> 00:59:37,559
Uh... Your Highness?

621
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:38,892
Yes?

622
00:59:38,892 --> 00:59:40,684
Well...

623
00:59:40,684 --> 00:59:46,038
Master Yangjoo, whom
Prince Moonsung was charged with,

624
00:59:46,038 --> 00:59:51,393
has agreed to participate
in the restoration project!

625
00:59:56,891 --> 01:00:00,891
How are things going with Prince Youngsung?

626
01:00:00,891 --> 01:00:06,267
Forgive me for saying this, but as of now,

627
01:00:06,267 --> 01:00:13,267
I don't think Prince Youngsung
can convince him.

628
01:00:16,434 --> 01:00:17,891
I see.

629
01:00:20,891 --> 01:00:23,434
Congratulations.

630
01:00:23,434 --> 01:00:25,891
Well done.

631
01:00:25,891 --> 01:00:29,934
In any case, what happened with Saeryung?

632
01:00:29,934 --> 01:00:34,476
I don't think she'll change her mind.

633
01:00:35,851 --> 01:00:37,891
Is that so?

634
01:00:59,891 --> 01:01:04,059
Goodnight, Your Highness.

635
01:01:04,059 --> 01:01:06,101
Goodnight.

636
01:01:19,226 --> 01:01:23,768
It didn't work out?

637
01:01:23,768 --> 01:01:25,601
No, it didn't.

638
01:01:25,601 --> 01:01:28,891
We stood outside his front yard
the whole day waiting for him.

639
01:01:28,891 --> 01:01:32,891
I have cramps.

640
01:01:32,891 --> 01:01:35,891
I didn't even get to eat dinner.

641
01:01:56,891 --> 01:02:00,643
Your Highness, I brought abalone porridge.

642
01:02:00,643 --> 01:02:03,891
I heard you skipped dinner.

643
01:02:04,891 --> 01:02:07,768
Thank you.

644
01:02:16,267 --> 01:02:18,059
Bye.

645
01:02:33,851 --> 01:02:38,891
Thanks... Yang Sooneui.

646
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:43,999
[Prince Hours]

647
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:17,726
Your Highness.

648
01:03:29,101 --> 01:03:34,891
What's on your mind?
Didn't you hear me call you?

649
01:03:34,891 --> 01:03:37,891
I have a question.

650
01:03:37,891 --> 01:03:39,891
What is it?

651
01:03:39,891 --> 01:03:45,559
I don't understand why Emperor Ikjo
wanted to make "Gunsangokdo."

652
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:50,101
That's when Emperor Ikjo just
ascended to the throne.

653
01:03:50,184 --> 01:03:54,934
Why would he want an
illustration of love like that?

654
01:03:54,934 --> 01:03:57,891
Besides, he was already married.

655
01:03:57,891 --> 01:04:01,810
Why would he want to make wedding rings?

656
01:04:01,810 --> 01:04:03,891
What did he feel he was missing?

657
01:04:03,891 --> 01:04:06,226
What?

658
01:04:06,226 --> 01:04:09,351
What I mean is...

659
01:04:12,891 --> 01:04:15,891
Did you figure something out?

660
01:04:18,975 --> 01:04:21,393
Is it not?

661
01:04:29,267 --> 01:04:31,892
Then, maybe...

662
01:04:31,892 --> 01:04:34,891
What is it?

663
01:04:35,975 --> 01:04:40,601
Maybe Emperor Ikjo had a secret lover.

664
01:04:40,601 --> 01:04:41,892
No way.

665
01:04:41,892 --> 01:04:44,891
Emperor Ikjo is famous for
his devotion to his wife.

666
01:04:44,891 --> 01:04:47,891
The Empress Dowager was
the only woman he loved.

667
01:04:47,891 --> 01:04:50,476
You never know.

668
01:04:50,476 --> 01:04:53,267
Maybe that poem wasn't about a lover.

669
01:04:53,309 --> 01:04:55,684
What?

670
01:04:55,684 --> 01:05:00,891
When I learned Chinese poetry, I heard
that the "one" can also mean a friend.

671
01:05:00,891 --> 01:05:02,892
Friend?

672
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:08,184
I doubt it.

673
01:05:08,184 --> 01:05:12,891
The picture had a man and a woman departing.

674
01:05:12,891 --> 01:05:17,891
If that's true, the picture is wrong.

675
01:05:17,891 --> 01:05:19,891
I see.

676
01:05:23,226 --> 01:05:27,891
Duck, rabbit...

677
01:05:33,226 --> 01:05:34,891
Where are you going?

678
01:05:34,891 --> 01:05:36,891
I have to go somewhere.

679
01:05:41,142 --> 01:05:42,891
Take me to Master Yangjoo's house.

680
01:05:42,891 --> 01:05:45,393
Where?

681
01:05:45,393 --> 01:05:46,891
Master Yangjoo's house.

682
01:05:46,891 --> 01:05:47,891
Not Master Byuksoo?

683
01:05:47,891 --> 01:05:48,975
No.

684
01:05:48,975 --> 01:05:52,017
But Prince Moonsung already...

685
01:05:52,142 --> 01:05:54,891
I don't care. Let's go.

686
01:05:54,891 --> 01:05:58,017
Yes, will do.

687
01:06:17,208 --> 01:06:18,822
[Prince Hours]

688
01:06:18,822 --> 01:06:21,785
What would you like to talk to me about?

689
01:06:21,785 --> 01:06:23,706
I'm here to ask you a question.

690
01:06:26,699 --> 01:06:31,587
I'm sorry for the grief I caused
you because of the ring.

691
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:33,935
Please don't worry.

692
01:06:33,935 --> 01:06:35,585
Everything will be okay.

693
01:06:36,888 --> 01:06:39,489
Something happened, right?

694
01:06:39,489 --> 01:06:43,139
Come visit me when you're on vacation.

695
01:06:45,372 --> 01:06:47,009
Hey, that palace attendant
we saw at the party

696
01:06:47,009 --> 01:06:49,467
came to the Royal Academy
to submit her application.

697
01:06:49,467 --> 01:06:51,028
I'm warning you.

698
01:06:51,028 --> 01:06:53,202
You better not lay a finger
on Attendant Yang.

699
01:06:53,202 --> 01:06:56,142
Are you sure you're not interested in her?

700
01:06:56,142 --> 01:06:57,833
How can you be attracted to someone else

701
01:06:57,833 --> 01:06:59,707
when you have a girl like
Saeryung next to you?

702
01:07:02,841 --> 01:07:07,235
Your Highness, a new attendant has
been assigned to Jipyoung Tower.

703
01:07:07,235 --> 01:07:11,131
Attendant Yang was transferred
on short notice.

704
01:07:11,131 --> 01:07:14,622
Attendant Yang has been transferred?
