1
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:15,373
Proceeds from today's auction will go to
UNICEF's fund for impoverished children.

2
00:00:15,373 --> 00:00:22,802
I'd like to thank Her Majesty again
for helping us with this auction.

3
00:00:23,622 --> 00:00:24,914
Get ready now.

4
00:00:32,383 --> 00:00:34,042
Her Majesty is in danger!

5
00:00:34,042 --> 00:00:36,814
A teddy bear with a replica of the
ceremonial dress Her Majesty wore at

6
00:00:36,814 --> 00:00:40,708
- her enthronement will be presented to her.
- What symbolizes the Empress?

7
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:47,370
No!

8
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,352
Hit!

9
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:54,017
Prince! Prince!

10
00:00:56,147 --> 00:00:57,416
Security!

11
00:00:58,028 --> 00:00:59,468
Your Highness!

12
00:00:59,468 --> 00:01:02,217
- I am fine. Protect the Prince.
- Your Highness!

13
00:01:02,217 --> 00:01:05,128
- Your Highness!
- Security!

14
00:01:16,227 --> 00:01:19,610
Yes, the suspect responsible
for this incident is still at large.

15
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,690
All we know now is the acrylic case

16
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:27,878
to be presented to the Empress was
installed with an electric-shocking device,

17
00:01:27,878 --> 00:01:32,006
and it seems that the suspect
was planning an act of terror.

18
00:01:32,006 --> 00:01:36,908
Prince Youngsung Yi Hoo
was moved to a hospital

19
00:01:36,908 --> 00:01:40,552
and is not yet awake.

20
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,302
They're coming! Hey, they're coming!

21
00:01:43,302 --> 00:01:45,089
Take a picture!

22
00:01:46,164 --> 00:01:48,174
Excuse me, tell us what happened!

23
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:51,695
Excuse me! Wait! Wait!

24
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:54,035
A terrorist act?

25
00:01:54,035 --> 00:01:57,427
This doesn't make sense!

26
00:01:57,427 --> 00:02:01,915
The royal guards and security
didn't know about this at all?

27
00:02:01,915 --> 00:02:04,227
Forgive us, Your Highness.

28
00:02:05,774 --> 00:02:11,465
I can't believe what just happened.

29
00:02:12,804 --> 00:02:17,099
Anyway, how's the Prince?

30
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,651
Is he getting better?

31
00:02:18,651 --> 00:02:20,939
I am sorry to tell you this.

32
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:27,434
He is still under examination
and he is not yet awake.

33
00:02:27,434 --> 00:02:30,923
Captain, please escort the
Prince back to the palace.

34
00:02:30,923 --> 00:02:32,213
Yes, Your Highness.

35
00:02:32,213 --> 00:02:37,005
Also, Grand Chamberlain, make sure the Prince
is in good hands at the Royal Infirmary.

36
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:38,338
Yes, Your Majesty.

37
00:02:39,647 --> 00:02:42,130
I cannot relax anymore.

38
00:02:58,101 --> 00:03:01,493
Why aren't you going home, Attendant Yang?

39
00:03:01,493 --> 00:03:05,149
Ma'am, how's Prince Youngsung?

40
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:08,165
I don't know anything as of now.

41
00:03:08,165 --> 00:03:12,851
We need to do our jobs perfectly
especially during times like these.

42
00:04:26,295 --> 00:04:28,794
Excuse me...

43
00:04:30,053 --> 00:04:34,086
Lady Ma will be here soon,
so go get some sleep.

44
00:04:34,086 --> 00:04:35,590
Thank you.

45
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,772
Let's go.

46
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,419
Mom?

47
00:05:28,342 --> 00:05:30,017
Mom!

48
00:05:33,822 --> 00:05:35,500
Mom...

49
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,875
Are you... okay?

50
00:05:45,822 --> 00:05:47,547
Yang Sooneui...

51
00:05:48,752 --> 00:05:51,697
were you here all night long?

52
00:05:53,294 --> 00:05:54,498
Yeah.

53
00:05:56,465 --> 00:05:59,340
Are you okay? How do you feel?

54
00:06:05,944 --> 00:06:10,141
I'm a little dizzy, but I'm okay.

55
00:06:14,664 --> 00:06:16,260
That's good.

56
00:06:17,888 --> 00:06:19,622
I'm relieved.

57
00:06:22,426 --> 00:06:24,262
I was worried.

58
00:06:32,156 --> 00:06:34,478
I'll go to Tae An Hall and tell them.

59
00:06:40,532 --> 00:06:44,478
Stay here for a moment...

60
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,447
Can... you?

61
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:11,278
Thanks for your concern.

62
00:07:15,332 --> 00:07:17,242
Are you stupid?

63
00:07:17,242 --> 00:07:19,478
How can I not be concerned?

64
00:07:20,818 --> 00:07:22,879
I thought I would never see you again.

65
00:07:26,147 --> 00:07:30,294
Yang Sooneui, you're still a crybaby.

66
00:07:46,651 --> 00:07:51,683
Suspects for yesterday's
terrorist act are still at large.

67
00:07:51,683 --> 00:07:54,963
Suspect Park insists he
was the sole perpetrator,

68
00:07:54,963 --> 00:07:58,669
but the police suspect others were involved,
so the investigation is ongoing.

69
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:03,025
Prince Youngsung who rescued
Her Majesty the Empress is now...

70
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:08,977
How's Prince Youngsung?

71
00:08:11,054 --> 00:08:14,349
He woke up just now.

72
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:16,765
You do not have to worry, Your Highness.

73
00:08:16,765 --> 00:08:18,976
Really? That's good.

74
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:20,109
Goodbye.

75
00:08:31,195 --> 00:08:31,695
Prince!

76
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:33,498
Isn't he great?

77
00:08:33,498 --> 00:08:35,906
He must be really athletic.

78
00:08:35,906 --> 00:08:39,264
Prince Hoo will become
really popular because of this.

79
00:08:39,264 --> 00:08:41,136
I like him now all of a sudden.

80
00:08:41,136 --> 00:08:45,250
Newspapers and TV are
saying nice things about him.

81
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,865
But, when will he wake up?

82
00:08:47,865 --> 00:08:51,971
I heard the electric shock was not bad
enough to affect his health that much.

83
00:08:51,971 --> 00:08:55,376
The psychological shock must be greater.

84
00:08:55,376 --> 00:08:58,826
Saeryung, you're his study buddy.
Don't you have to go check on him?

85
00:09:00,037 --> 00:09:03,081
If I go now, it'll only
make things complicated...

86
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:07,084
He's healthy. He'll wake up soon.

87
00:09:08,094 --> 00:09:09,643
Are you okay?

88
00:09:10,903 --> 00:09:13,413
Are you really okay?

89
00:09:13,413 --> 00:09:14,512
Yes.

90
00:09:16,491 --> 00:09:20,082
I'm relieved now that I hear your voice.

91
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:24,610
It's good that it was not severe.

92
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,128
Yes. I'm relieved.

93
00:09:27,128 --> 00:09:29,630
You took years off my life.

94
00:09:30,475 --> 00:09:32,179
I'm fine.

95
00:09:32,936 --> 00:09:35,880
There might be some side effects.

96
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,224
Is everything okay?

97
00:09:38,774 --> 00:09:40,153
I'm fine.

98
00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:45,529
But, are you okay, Your Majesty?

99
00:09:46,605 --> 00:09:48,592
You must've been in shock...

100
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:51,552
I'm okay.

101
00:09:54,018 --> 00:09:55,329
Thanks...

102
00:09:56,068 --> 00:09:58,083
And I'm sorry...

103
00:09:59,024 --> 00:10:00,145
Because of me...

104
00:10:00,145 --> 00:10:02,960
No! Not at all.

105
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,909
A brother can't just
watch his sister get hurt.

106
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:13,982
How can the Prince be this kind?

107
00:10:16,251 --> 00:10:25,899
I always wanted a son,
but now I feel like I have a son.

108
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,201
Hoo,

109
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,530
thanks for what you did.

110
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,705
But, don't ever do that again, okay?

111
00:10:38,364 --> 00:10:41,097
You are really important to us.

112
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:48,787
Even if I get in trouble,
you need to protect yourself.

113
00:10:50,687 --> 00:10:52,714
Can you promise me that?

114
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:57,483
I can't promise...

115
00:11:00,605 --> 00:11:04,395
I don't want to lose any more family.

116
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,815
When my mother passed
away, I thought to myself,

117
00:11:08,815 --> 00:11:15,307
if I ever get a family again,
I will protect them.

118
00:11:17,768 --> 00:11:22,136
The Prince is more caring
than you think, huh?

119
00:11:22,136 --> 00:11:24,009
That's the real him.

120
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:27,424
Your Highness, the medicine is here.

121
00:11:27,424 --> 00:11:28,613
Come in.

122
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,212
Medicine?

123
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:49,312
It's made from black ginseng that's
been boiled and dried 9 times.

124
00:11:49,312 --> 00:11:54,484
You need to drink this to regain
the strength you lost after the shock.

125
00:11:59,795 --> 00:12:01,159
Oh... bitter!

126
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,139
Hold your nose like this,

127
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:08,026
and drink it!

128
00:12:08,026 --> 00:12:10,199
Yes! At once!

129
00:12:14,435 --> 00:12:16,911
Oh so bitter... Bitter...!

130
00:12:18,565 --> 00:12:20,923
What can we do?

131
00:12:20,923 --> 00:12:25,927
We made a month's worth,
so you'll need to take it for a month.

132
00:12:25,927 --> 00:12:28,436
What? A month?

133
00:12:54,071 --> 00:12:59,644
I will deliver the Prince's
medicine from today.

134
00:12:59,644 --> 00:13:03,101
Where are you going to go with that hair?

135
00:13:06,506 --> 00:13:13,248
What if the substance from
your hair drops in there?

136
00:13:13,248 --> 00:13:15,598
Don't you look at the mirror?

137
00:13:15,598 --> 00:13:18,913
How can you keep such an
obnoxious hairstyle in the palace?

138
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,748
Do not put anything in your
hair starting from tomorrow!

139
00:13:23,748 --> 00:13:25,675
Well...

140
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,527
if I don't mousse my hair,
the style doesn't come out...

141
00:13:31,764 --> 00:13:33,765
Are you disobeying me?

142
00:13:33,765 --> 00:13:36,696
No... I shouldn't...

143
00:14:04,564 --> 00:14:13,321
We need to try our best to comfort
Prince Youngsung for the next few days.

144
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:18,271
We've been doing three
shifts in groups of two,

145
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:23,086
but we will do two shifts
in groups of three this week.

146
00:14:23,086 --> 00:14:29,357
It'll be hard, but let's be strong until
Prince Youngsung regains his strength.

147
00:14:29,357 --> 00:14:30,925
Understand?

148
00:14:30,925 --> 00:14:32,568
Yes, ma'am.

149
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:46,096
Please forgive me for coming so late
to visit after the shocking event.

150
00:14:47,324 --> 00:14:53,157
The police are investigating,
so the truth will come out.

151
00:14:53,157 --> 00:14:55,344
Of course.

152
00:14:56,268 --> 00:15:00,006
Anyhow, how's Prince Youngsung?

153
00:15:03,858 --> 00:15:08,807
He woke up, so you don't
have to worry about that.

154
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:12,599
Ah, that's great.

155
00:15:15,052 --> 00:15:20,063
Now that he's awake, may I go see him?

156
00:15:22,146 --> 00:15:27,596
Please permit me to visit him
along with Prince Moonsung.

157
00:15:27,596 --> 00:15:29,532
You should.

158
00:15:29,532 --> 00:15:32,416
You should, as an uncle.

159
00:15:34,132 --> 00:15:41,337
Madam Chamberlain, Call Jipyoung
Tower and let them guide him.

160
00:15:41,337 --> 00:15:42,709
Yes, Your Majesty.

161
00:15:43,852 --> 00:15:45,601
Thank you, Your Majesty.

162
00:15:56,884 --> 00:16:00,740
Thank you, Uncle, for visiting me.

163
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:06,263
How can I be still after what
happened to my nephew?

164
00:16:06,263 --> 00:16:08,120
So, how do you feel?

165
00:16:08,788 --> 00:16:10,843
I'm okay.

166
00:16:10,843 --> 00:16:15,887
The fact that Her Majesty is
well is what matters the most.

167
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:20,009
You don't even know who you are!

168
00:16:20,988 --> 00:16:21,972
Pardon?

169
00:16:21,972 --> 00:16:27,101
You are next in line to the throne.

170
00:16:27,101 --> 00:16:30,821
The bravery you displayed when
rescuing Her Majesty was great,

171
00:16:30,821 --> 00:16:34,664
but you need to take care of yourself.

172
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:38,848
You may get hurt if you
jump in without thinking.

173
00:16:39,404 --> 00:16:44,869
How can I think about myself
when Her Majesty was in danger?

174
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:49,000
Even if the same thing happens,
I'd do it all over again.

175
00:16:49,732 --> 00:16:50,964
Is that so?

176
00:16:50,964 --> 00:16:54,840
I think I also have the responsibility
of protecting the royal family.

177
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,748
However, Uncle,

178
00:16:58,748 --> 00:17:02,928
Most of all, I wonder
who would do such thing.

179
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:10,716
I greatly honor your concerns about
the Empress and the royal family,

180
00:17:10,716 --> 00:17:17,754
but for now, you just need to worry about
your health and going back to studying.

181
00:17:18,983 --> 00:17:22,618
That's the best thing you can do
for the Empress and the royal family.

182
00:17:23,272 --> 00:17:26,194
I have great expectations from you.

183
00:17:28,783 --> 00:17:31,977
Well, I'll be going now.

184
00:17:31,977 --> 00:17:34,102
Take care of yourself.

185
00:17:34,102 --> 00:17:35,195
Yes...

186
00:17:35,195 --> 00:17:37,041
No, don't get up.

187
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:04,729
Are you sure what happened
has nothing to do with you?

188
00:18:08,164 --> 00:18:11,137
There must be a connection to you somehow.

189
00:18:11,885 --> 00:18:19,748
Whether it was the monarchy abolitionists
or those who are against the Empress,

190
00:18:19,748 --> 00:18:28,360
I know you were behind it regardless.

191
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,044
Now that Prince Youngsung has rescued her,

192
00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:38,184
she must be thinking about putting
him on the throne even more.

193
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:44,397
Just as the water a snake
drinks becomes poison,

194
00:18:44,397 --> 00:18:47,622
and the water a cow drinks becomes milk,

195
00:18:47,622 --> 00:18:50,849
there are always hidden
things behind everything.

196
00:18:56,045 --> 00:18:59,902
A wild rabbit has sacrificed itself,

197
00:18:59,902 --> 00:19:02,784
but it can never be the king of the jungle.

198
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:08,389
Now that the Empress' life is in danger,

199
00:19:08,389 --> 00:19:11,617
they will have to rush the
installation of the Crown Prince.

200
00:19:12,613 --> 00:19:14,787
Father!

201
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:17,363
I don't like doing things this way.

202
00:19:18,577 --> 00:19:21,638
I want to compete fairly
against Prince Youngsung

203
00:19:21,638 --> 00:19:24,979
and become an acknowledged Crown Prince.

204
00:19:26,087 --> 00:19:28,274
You pathetic fool!

205
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:35,466
Do you still think you can become Crown
Prince with skill and qualifications alone?

206
00:19:38,326 --> 00:19:42,216
I'll take care of things.

207
00:19:42,216 --> 00:19:44,315
You just follow along.

208
00:19:54,246 --> 00:19:59,060
Come home often, at least for your mother.

209
00:20:03,255 --> 00:20:06,553
What? It's powdered medicine.

210
00:20:06,553 --> 00:20:08,887
They said your muscles went
into shock when you fell,

211
00:20:08,887 --> 00:20:10,787
so you should take this for your muscles.

212
00:20:12,287 --> 00:20:15,710
I hate powdered medicine.
Aren't there any pills?

213
00:20:16,945 --> 00:20:18,689
Just take it.

214
00:20:18,689 --> 00:20:22,034
Are you a child who can't
handle powered medicine?

215
00:20:22,034 --> 00:20:23,515
I'll put it in for you.

216
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:25,266
Okay! Open up.

217
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,423
Ah... Ahhh!

218
00:20:29,423 --> 00:20:31,095
You act like a mother.

219
00:20:31,095 --> 00:20:32,179
Hand it over.

220
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,182
Oh man...

221
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:42,110
Water, water, water!

222
00:20:50,098 --> 00:20:51,455
So bitter!

223
00:20:53,187 --> 00:20:54,406
Eat this.

224
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,035
This was chocolate?

225
00:21:00,752 --> 00:21:03,355
Yeah, because I thought it would be bitter.

226
00:21:04,135 --> 00:21:06,049
You eat some, too.

227
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:08,252
You like chocolate.

228
00:21:08,252 --> 00:21:09,603
How did you know?

229
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,432
When you were little,

230
00:21:11,432 --> 00:21:14,359
you used to sit on chocolate in
your back pocket, remember?

231
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:15,703
You remember that?

232
00:21:15,703 --> 00:21:18,383
Hey, it wasn't just couple times.

233
00:21:18,383 --> 00:21:22,431
How were you good at studying
when you're this forgetful?

234
00:21:22,431 --> 00:21:27,021
I think you have separate brains
for studying and living day-to-day.

235
00:21:30,351 --> 00:21:31,566
It's good!

236
00:21:31,566 --> 00:21:32,880
Have some more.

237
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,947
It's okay.

238
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:41,729
Anyway...

239
00:21:41,729 --> 00:21:43,556
Who could it be?

240
00:21:44,585 --> 00:21:47,084
Who could think of plotting
something so dangerous?

241
00:21:48,384 --> 00:21:49,669
I don't know.

242
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,196
I think I was too naive.

243
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:34,447
You little thing.

244
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:39,009
[Prince Hours]

245
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:08,066
Friends!

246
00:23:08,066 --> 00:23:10,112
Hey! Hoo!

247
00:23:10,112 --> 00:23:12,362
- Oh, Hoo!
- Hey!

248
00:23:14,146 --> 00:23:15,924
- Ah!
- Ahhhh!

249
00:23:16,031 --> 00:23:17,912
- Are you okay?
- How are you?

250
00:23:17,912 --> 00:23:19,841
Are you all recovered?

251
00:23:20,556 --> 00:23:22,383
As you can see...

252
00:23:22,383 --> 00:23:26,406
Hey, what do you think I gained
from delivering Chinese noodles?

253
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:29,589
I gained strength, and more...

254
00:23:31,313 --> 00:23:32,606
strength!

255
00:23:33,639 --> 00:23:34,624
Right.

256
00:23:34,624 --> 00:23:39,418
Hey, it seems as though
security has been beefed up.

257
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,897
Is it because of what happened?

258
00:23:40,897 --> 00:23:43,186
I think Her Highness is worried.

259
00:23:43,186 --> 00:23:46,637
They stand 4 meters away when we're outside
and 10 meters away inside the Academy.

260
00:23:47,465 --> 00:23:52,745
Hey! Then are you becoming Crown
Prince now because of the rescue?

261
00:23:52,745 --> 00:23:55,695
I knew you would be something.

262
00:23:56,641 --> 00:24:02,994
Will you still hang out with us even after
you become Crown Prince, Your Highness?

263
00:24:02,994 --> 00:24:05,355
Hey! Hey!

264
00:24:05,355 --> 00:24:06,705
Don't joke around.

265
00:24:12,748 --> 00:24:14,321
- Hey.
- Huh?

266
00:24:14,321 --> 00:24:16,410
Why is everyone looking at me like that?

267
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,737
Isn't it obvious?

268
00:24:17,737 --> 00:24:19,849
You're the hero who rescued Her Majesty.

269
00:24:19,849 --> 00:24:25,209
Yes! The world is finally
realizing your true value.

270
00:24:25,209 --> 00:24:27,361
Crown Prince... Right?

271
00:24:27,361 --> 00:24:30,369
Crown Prince! Crown Prince!

272
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:35,557
- Crown Prince...
- Aren't you jumping the gun a bit?

273
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,888
He cannot even compare to Joon.

274
00:24:38,888 --> 00:24:40,267
Enough. Stop it already.

275
00:24:55,816 --> 00:24:57,039
Prince Youngsung.

276
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,507
My friend was rude. Don't mind him.

277
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,786
How do you feel?

278
00:25:33,786 --> 00:25:35,260
I'm perfect.

279
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,272
I'm strong, you know.

280
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:40,665
I was worried about you.

281
00:25:43,364 --> 00:25:46,156
Anyway, you must be taking astronomy.

282
00:25:46,156 --> 00:25:47,210
Yes.

283
00:25:48,342 --> 00:25:51,005
There aren't that many
people taking that class.

284
00:25:51,005 --> 00:25:53,524
My mother really liked stars.

285
00:25:53,524 --> 00:25:55,440
So, I want to study about them.

286
00:26:02,084 --> 00:26:04,840
Was your mother romantic?

287
00:26:05,462 --> 00:26:09,827
She had no concept of time
when she was watching stars.

288
00:26:09,827 --> 00:26:14,420
She sang and read poems for
me while looking at the stars...

289
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:19,192
And, we even went on top of
a mountain to see the North Star.

290
00:26:20,342 --> 00:26:22,460
Your mother liked the North Star?

291
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,237
Yes.

292
00:26:24,237 --> 00:26:26,694
Which star do you like, Saeryung?

293
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,664
I also like the North Star.

294
00:26:30,664 --> 00:26:34,688
It's the main star of all the stars.

295
00:26:34,688 --> 00:26:38,392
So they often compare
palace to the North Star.

296
00:26:38,392 --> 00:26:42,876
If the North Star is the center of the sky,
then the palace is the center of the earth.

297
00:26:42,876 --> 00:26:45,722
The palace is the center of the earth...

298
00:26:45,722 --> 00:26:46,935
Really?

299
00:26:47,746 --> 00:26:52,303
Oh, was your mother in
Korea when you were little?

300
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,231
When I was little.

301
00:26:57,194 --> 00:27:03,109
Speaking of which, she even knitted
gloves and sweaters for me.

302
00:27:04,084 --> 00:27:06,142
I had forgotten about that.

303
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:14,382
Regardless of what people say,
I think mothers are all loving.

304
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:19,226
If we had known each
other when we were young,

305
00:27:19,226 --> 00:27:21,929
I might have been terribly jealous
because of your mom.

306
00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:22,885
What?

307
00:27:24,634 --> 00:27:25,800
Let's go.

308
00:27:34,892 --> 00:27:38,772
Yesterday, I found this
interesting phrase from a book.

309
00:27:40,816 --> 00:27:44,968
"Future is fear when it's unknown,"

310
00:27:44,968 --> 00:27:47,536
"but joy when it's clear."

311
00:27:49,063 --> 00:27:53,636
Some of you may have a clear
picture about your future.

312
00:27:54,646 --> 00:27:58,535
The others may still be searching for it

313
00:27:58,535 --> 00:28:04,387
or... have it somehow decided.

314
00:28:07,255 --> 00:28:13,006
Now, close your eyes,
and think about for a minute

315
00:28:16,692 --> 00:28:21,903
Is your future joy or fear?

316
00:28:26,235 --> 00:28:28,767
You may leave when you get an answer.

317
00:29:20,106 --> 00:29:21,676
Wow...

318
00:29:24,736 --> 00:29:27,001
These are all from the people?

319
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:28,859
Yeah.

320
00:29:39,773 --> 00:29:43,474
You now know how concerned they were?

321
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,785
Everyone's worried about you.

322
00:29:51,143 --> 00:29:54,097
You are the hero who rescued Her Majesty.

323
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:59,693
I heard the royal family
gets all the attention,

324
00:29:59,693 --> 00:30:01,137
but it's really true.

325
00:30:03,223 --> 00:30:04,833
Do you feel the responsibility?

326
00:30:06,422 --> 00:30:07,434
A little.

327
00:30:10,126 --> 00:30:14,489
But, there are many things
you can do as a royal.

328
00:30:15,517 --> 00:30:21,101
You can do good things for
the citizens and be respected.

329
00:30:21,101 --> 00:30:23,401
There are people who
want that, but can't.

330
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,962
Will I be able to do that?

331
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:37,000
A personal grudge?

332
00:30:37,938 --> 00:30:43,163
They say he was someone who was embittered
after being fired from the Royal Guard,

333
00:30:43,163 --> 00:30:49,554
so he did this terrible thing
because of that grudge.

334
00:30:49,554 --> 00:30:53,885
Also, he insists he did it alone.

335
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,660
Does that make any sense?

336
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,238
If they communicated
via walkie-talkies,

337
00:30:57,238 --> 00:30:59,591
then there must be an accomplice.

338
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,449
Tell them to continue investigating.

339
00:31:01,449 --> 00:31:02,828
Yes. Your Majesty.

340
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:08,392
Also, this is the file from the
Royal Investigation Commission.

341
00:31:08,392 --> 00:31:12,602
It seems the suspect had
been guarding some of the

342
00:31:12,602 --> 00:31:16,812
Imperial Court privately
and it went unreported.

343
00:31:16,812 --> 00:31:18,348
Among them...

344
00:31:18,348 --> 00:31:20,831
Grand Prince Hyojang must
have been one of them.

345
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:24,785
Yes, he was, Your Majesty.

346
00:31:24,785 --> 00:31:29,017
But, since those are royal households...

347
00:31:29,017 --> 00:31:32,484
it will be difficult to continue
with the investigation.

348
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,142
Investigate them all!

349
00:31:37,142 --> 00:31:40,174
Even Grand Prince Hyojang's
house is not an exception.

350
00:31:40,174 --> 00:31:42,083
We will follow your order.

351
00:32:03,993 --> 00:32:05,362
Go outside.

352
00:32:09,558 --> 00:32:12,191
I thank you on behalf of
Royal Investigation Commission

353
00:32:12,191 --> 00:32:16,907
for cooperating with the
investigation, Your Highness.

354
00:32:18,494 --> 00:32:21,140
We will be going now.

355
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:30,249
Even after what happened,

356
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:33,204
how can they be so
disrespectful, Grand Prince?

357
00:32:34,887 --> 00:32:38,694
How dare they investigate our home!

358

That's not important.

538
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:52,487
Although we're friends, we're different.

539
00:47:55,155 --> 00:47:58,864
I'm not stupid enough to not know that.

540
00:48:01,067 --> 00:48:04,127
Keep in mind that you're a Prince.

541
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:07,724
You'll be Crown Prince,

542
00:48:07,724 --> 00:48:09,888
and you'll be Emperor in the future.

543
00:48:11,718 --> 00:48:13,299
Hoo!

544
00:48:13,299 --> 00:48:14,568
Attendant Yang!

545
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,682
Court Lady Han! This is...

546
00:48:22,682 --> 00:48:25,222
Attendant Yang, come out at once!

547
00:48:26,834 --> 00:48:30,849
I wanted to do this. I'll handle it.

548
00:48:30,849 --> 00:48:32,536
Your Highness.

549
00:48:32,536 --> 00:48:36,768
Overseeing the Jipyoung
Tower court ladies is my job.

550
00:48:36,768 --> 00:48:41,642
Also, a person in a higher position should
not be doing his subordinate's work.

551
00:48:41,642 --> 00:48:44,345
But did I not apologize to you?

552
00:48:44,345 --> 00:48:48,081
I'm not saying this as the head
court lady of Jipyoung Tower,

553
00:48:48,081 --> 00:48:51,766
but as your instructor, Your Highness.

554
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:55,105
If you get more involved,

555
00:48:55,105 --> 00:48:57,996
I will need to report it to Her Majesty.

556
00:49:02,888 --> 00:49:11,241
Didn't I warn you that if I see you
acting improperly as a court lady,

557
00:49:11,241 --> 00:49:14,261
I would punish you?

558
00:49:14,825 --> 00:49:16,581
I'm sorry.

559
00:49:17,857 --> 00:49:23,177
I pointed it out several times,
but you did not listen.

560
00:49:23,177 --> 00:49:27,317
So, you have no excuse, correct?

561
00:49:29,521 --> 00:49:30,524
Yes.

562
00:49:31,466 --> 00:49:38,645
Then, do you want to be ousted from the
palace or receive the proper punishment?

563
00:49:42,841 --> 00:49:44,730
Bring it now!

564
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:45,654
Yes, ma'am.

565
00:50:05,281 --> 00:50:07,474
Did something happen, Attendant Ma?

566
00:50:07,474 --> 00:50:09,900
Help her, Your Highness!

567
00:50:10,617 --> 00:50:12,497
Attendant Yang is...

568
00:50:12,497 --> 00:50:14,223
Attendant Yang is...

569
00:50:14,223 --> 00:50:21,467
Do not blame me for your
rash and thoughtless action.

570
00:50:22,621 --> 00:50:23,658
Yes.

571
00:50:25,158 --> 00:50:26,483
Wait!

572
00:50:34,005 --> 00:50:36,687
May I help you, Your Highness?

573
00:50:36,687 --> 00:50:39,720
I am sorry for interrupting, Lady Han.

574
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,016
Please speak.

575
00:50:41,016 --> 00:50:45,848
Although the court lady
might have acted improperly,

576
00:50:45,848 --> 00:50:47,560
I think the punishment is too cruel.

577
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,537
But...

578
00:50:48,537 --> 00:50:53,606
Anyhow, I cannot just ignore my
residential attendant being punished.

579
00:50:53,606 --> 00:50:56,575
If you dismiss her thoughtless deeds,

580
00:50:56,575 --> 00:50:59,095
then the entire order of
the palace will fall apart.

581
00:50:59,095 --> 00:51:01,213
Please understand.

582
00:51:01,213 --> 00:51:03,235
Then, let's do this.

583
00:51:04,824 --> 00:51:10,959
I can still save face and you can maintain
your authority over those below you.

584
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:16,936
To reflect on her mistakes for breaking
the code of conduct, Attendant Yang

585
00:51:16,936 --> 00:51:19,789
should be prohibited from Prince
Youngsung's place for a while.

586
00:51:21,192 --> 00:51:22,961
How's that?

587
00:51:22,961 --> 00:51:25,972
I think that's the appropriate punishment.

588
00:51:25,972 --> 00:51:30,636
That is against my principles
on managing subordinates.

589
00:51:30,636 --> 00:51:32,140
Lady Han, you are the person

590
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:35,506
who most respects the
authority of the royal family.

591
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:40,934
I am telling you this as a Prince.

592
00:51:40,934 --> 00:51:44,138
Please consider that for my sake.

593
00:52:03,743 --> 00:52:07,022
I can't just let it be. I'll be back.

594
00:52:07,022 --> 00:52:08,432
Your Highness!

595
00:52:10,885 --> 00:52:13,957
If you go now, Attendant Yang
will be in more trouble.

596
00:52:13,957 --> 00:52:17,506
I think you should just see what happens.

597
00:52:21,845 --> 00:52:23,102
What happened?

598
00:52:23,102 --> 00:52:25,638
Well...

599
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:31,455
Prince Moonsung stepped in,
so she wasn't punished.

600
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:35,299
Prince Moonsung?

601
00:52:35,299 --> 00:52:36,992
That's it?

602
00:52:36,992 --> 00:52:38,624
And...

603
00:52:38,624 --> 00:52:39,952
And?

604
00:52:39,952 --> 00:52:43,943
She is banned from your
residence for a while.

605
00:52:43,943 --> 00:52:46,371
What did you say?

606
00:53:11,127 --> 00:53:13,260
How far are you willing to go?

607
00:53:15,695 --> 00:53:19,197
I didn't mean to hurt you that day.

608
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:23,492
I'm already hurt.

609
00:53:40,807 --> 00:53:45,463
Yang Sooneui, are you okay?

610
00:53:45,463 --> 00:53:47,534
No...

611
00:53:47,534 --> 00:53:49,492
I don't think so.

612
00:53:50,238 --> 00:53:53,078
Let me... be alone for a moment.

613
00:53:53,078 --> 00:53:54,523
Okay.

614
00:54:08,888 --> 00:54:10,829
[Kang Hoo]

615
00:54:40,803 --> 00:54:44,464
Attendant Yang, are you going somewhere?

616
00:54:44,464 --> 00:54:46,707
Yeah, to Prince Moonsung's.

617
00:54:46,707 --> 00:54:47,824
Okay.

618
00:54:49,571 --> 00:54:50,896
Lady Ma!

619
00:55:22,364 --> 00:55:24,192
Here's the morning paper.

620
00:55:44,404 --> 00:55:48,967
You did one more favor for me yesterday.

621
00:55:50,131 --> 00:55:53,553
Thank you.

622
00:55:54,331 --> 00:55:57,372
I might have done something unreasonable,

623
00:55:57,372 --> 00:55:59,921
but I didn't want to see you get punished.

624
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:05,776
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

625
00:56:06,523 --> 00:56:08,583
I never thought I was being bothered.

626
00:56:08,583 --> 00:56:10,308
So don't worry about it.

627
00:56:11,898 --> 00:56:13,645
Just hang in there for a while.

628
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:18,151
I will make sure it'll be back to normal.

629
00:56:18,151 --> 00:56:19,436
I promise.

630
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:30,704
The look on your face right now

631
00:56:30,704 --> 00:56:33,182
is just like mine when my guitar broke.

632
00:56:34,538 --> 00:56:35,766
Pardon?

633
00:56:36,305 --> 00:56:39,186
I loved the guitar ever since I was little,

634
00:56:39,186 --> 00:56:41,637
so I played it without my father knowing.

635
00:56:43,561 --> 00:56:48,504
My father thought royals
shouldn't play the guitar

636
00:56:48,504 --> 00:56:51,574
and whenever it was found,
the guitar was broken.

637
00:56:53,257 --> 00:56:56,424
Just before my last guitar broke,

638
00:56:56,424 --> 00:56:59,046
I decided to listen to my father.

639
00:57:02,346 --> 00:57:05,313
To protect the guitar,

640
00:57:05,313 --> 00:57:09,677
I gave up myself and lived as a royal.

641
00:57:11,441 --> 00:57:13,308
I understand.

642
00:57:14,265 --> 00:57:16,290
It was important to you,

643
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:19,348
so you didn't want to lose it.

644
00:57:21,025 --> 00:57:26,538
You wanted to keep it with you, right?

645
00:57:26,538 --> 00:57:29,830
Yes, that's right.

646
00:57:32,995 --> 00:57:39,095
I want to find out what's
important in my life again.

647
00:57:43,442 --> 00:57:46,374
I think it's because I met someone.

648
00:57:49,827 --> 00:57:52,119
That person is so transparent.

649
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:57,551
The person is so clear and transparent
that I can see myself.

650
00:57:59,283 --> 00:58:02,959
Not the royal me, but the real me.

651
00:58:06,283 --> 00:58:09,255
You look good with your
guitar, Your Highness.

652
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:15,704
Really?

653
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:17,448
Yes!

654
00:58:59,756 --> 00:59:02,644
I'm sorry I can't go to
your engagement party!

655
00:59:02,644 --> 00:59:04,601
Do you like the necklace?

656
00:59:24,202 --> 00:59:27,150
You're here without even calling...

657
00:59:32,848 --> 00:59:35,109
I have something to tell you.

658
00:59:36,144 --> 00:59:37,838
What is it?

659
00:59:45,444 --> 00:59:49,589
Father, I want to break off the
engagement to Saeryung.

660
00:59:52,729 --> 00:59:56,790
I don't want to marry Saeryung.

661
00:59:59,649 --> 01:00:01,288
What's the reason?

662
01:00:02,994 --> 01:00:05,208
Did Saeryung tell you to do that?

663
01:00:05,208 --> 01:00:07,155
Everything is my idea.

664
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:15,044
Until now, I only listened to what you said,

665
01:00:16,344 --> 01:00:20,971
but this time, I can't.

666
01:00:20,971 --> 01:00:26,010
But, you know what the
engagement means to us?

667
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:28,830
I'm sorry.

668
01:00:29,707 --> 01:00:33,276
I'll just pretend I didn't
hear what you said today.

669
01:00:33,276 --> 01:00:34,235
Father!

670
01:00:34,235 --> 01:00:37,899
The engagement will happen as planned.

671
01:00:37,899 --> 01:00:39,598
Just so you know.

672
01:00:50,435 --> 01:00:51,711
Joon!

673
01:00:54,035 --> 01:00:57,685
Why did you do that? Huh?

674
01:00:57,685 --> 01:00:59,214
I need to go.

675
01:00:59,214 --> 01:01:00,809
Joon,

676
01:01:00,809 --> 01:01:04,226
I don't like Saeryung that much,

677
01:01:04,226 --> 01:01:07,248
but who meets all the conditions
better than she does?

678
01:01:07,248 --> 01:01:10,369
You know you need the support
from the Deputy Prime Minister

679
01:01:10,369 --> 01:01:12,118
to become Crown Prince, right?

680
01:01:12,118 --> 01:01:17,825
Mother, just let me handle it this time.

681
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:23,554
Father always commanded, and I always obeyed.

682
01:01:24,868 --> 01:01:27,771
I'm not a puppet that only
does what he wants me to.

683
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:31,662
It was all for you!

684
01:01:31,662 --> 01:01:34,124
Let me do what I want this time.

685
01:01:41,103 --> 01:01:42,527
Joon.

686
01:01:44,051 --> 01:01:49,329
You are my only hope.

687
01:01:49,329 --> 01:01:52,142
Please don't do this to me.

688
01:01:52,142 --> 01:01:55,051
You didn't marry Father
because you loved him, right?

689
01:01:59,158 --> 01:02:04,971
That always hurt me
since you were never happy.

690
01:02:41,512 --> 01:02:44,963
Do you think that's being "fine"?

691
01:02:46,583 --> 01:02:48,803
What has he been doing?

692
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:53,363
Forgive me, Your Highness.

693
01:02:56,359 --> 01:02:58,923
There is something going on.

694
01:02:59,848 --> 01:03:02,310
Find out what it is.

695
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:03,558
Yes.

696
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:06,798
I will be leaving then...

697
01:03:41,533 --> 01:03:42,876
Eunuch Kwak!

698
01:03:45,717 --> 01:03:47,636
Your Highness!

699
01:03:47,636 --> 01:03:49,104
Did Attendant Yang leave?

700
01:03:49,104 --> 01:03:51,705
She just left, Your Highness,

701
01:03:51,705 --> 01:03:54,481
is there something I can do?

702
01:03:54,481 --> 01:03:56,273
I can find her if I go now, right?

703
01:03:56,273 --> 01:03:59,538
Your Highness, please do not look
for Attendant Yang anymore.

704
01:03:59,538 --> 01:04:03,234
She'll be the one in trouble
if you keep looking... for her!

705
01:04:03,234 --> 01:04:04,322
Your Highness!

706
01:04:23,041 --> 01:04:24,637
Are you going home?

707
01:04:25,688 --> 01:04:27,563
You just came back?

708
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:31,368
I don't know what to do
with the dress you returned.

709
01:04:34,171 --> 01:04:35,463
I'm sorry.

710
01:04:36,475 --> 01:04:40,399
Will you accept something
other than the dress?

711
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:07,989
Did you know? You're the one who
got me playing the guitar again.

712
01:05:13,424 --> 01:05:15,872
I don't know when it started,

713
01:05:15,872 --> 01:05:23,886
but I have someone that I miss,
care about and want by side.

714
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:29,662
I'm sorry. I should go.

715
01:05:35,129 --> 01:05:38,594
You already know that it's you.

716
01:05:39,029 --> 01:05:40,528
Your Highness!

717
01:05:40,528 --> 01:05:43,525
I don't want to force you
to do anything right now.

718
01:05:46,825 --> 01:05:51,990
I would have to risk so much to have you.

719
01:05:55,226 --> 01:06:04,950
So, until then, don't give
your heart to anyone.

720
01:06:09,704 --> 01:06:11,340
Don't forget my words.
