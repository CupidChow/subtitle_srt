1
00:00:05,936 --> 00:00:07,936
Attendant Yang.

2
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:15,396
Good night, Your Highness.

3
00:00:15,396 --> 00:00:16,646
I'll give you a ride.

4
00:00:16,646 --> 00:00:18,936
No thank you.

5
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:20,271
Don't mind me.

6
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:21,936
Good night.

7
00:00:21,936 --> 00:00:24,813
It must've been a tough day.

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,936
I bet you were bored.

9
00:00:29,936 --> 00:00:33,936
No, it was fun.

10
00:00:33,936 --> 00:00:35,896
Bye.

11
00:01:10,936 --> 00:01:13,936
Your Highness. I'll see you tomorrow.

12
00:01:13,936 --> 00:01:17,936
Huh? Okay.

13
00:01:17,936 --> 00:01:21,936
I'm sorry. That was rude of me.

14
00:01:25,312 --> 00:01:27,936
Are you okay?

15
00:01:27,936 --> 00:01:32,688
You seemed to be in a bad mood.

16
00:01:32,688 --> 00:01:35,936
Is that what you thought?

17
00:01:35,936 --> 00:01:37,896
Yes.

18
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:42,604
I thought you did it
because you were ticked off...

19
00:01:42,604 --> 00:01:46,312
I already apologized for that, Your Highness.

20
00:01:46,312 --> 00:01:48,771
If you're still bothered by it, I can...

21
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:52,936
Don't worry about it.

22
00:01:52,936 --> 00:01:56,396
I did that once when I was drunk, too.

23
00:01:57,936 --> 00:02:00,688
I'll just pretend it didn't happen.

24
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:02,396
I'll just forget about it.

25
00:02:02,396 --> 00:02:03,979
Don't worry.

26
00:02:11,936 --> 00:02:14,771
I hope you don't forget it.

27
00:02:14,771 --> 00:02:17,936
After all, it was my first kiss.

28
00:04:21,936 --> 00:04:23,936
Yang Sooneui.

29
00:04:29,104 --> 00:04:30,020
Yes?

30
00:04:31,936 --> 00:04:36,771
I always knew you were absentminded,
but it's a little worse today.

31
00:04:36,771 --> 00:04:39,936
You barely touched your breakfast.

32
00:04:39,936 --> 00:04:41,229
Tell me.

33
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:42,855
Tell you what?

34
00:04:42,855 --> 00:04:44,936
When did you come home last night?

35
00:04:44,936 --> 00:04:52,479
I stayed up until 3 a.m. waiting for
you to hear what happened.

36
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,187
I doubt the party lasted that long.

37
00:04:56,187 --> 00:04:58,979
Where did you go? With whom?

38
00:05:00,936 --> 00:05:06,936
What happened? Something happened, right?

39
00:05:06,936 --> 00:05:10,936
Nothing happened.

40
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:14,979
I already told you that it was boring.

41
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:22,438
I went for a walk near the Han River.

42
00:05:22,438 --> 00:05:24,354
That late at night?

43
00:05:24,354 --> 00:05:26,396
Why not?

44
00:05:26,396 --> 00:05:29,813
There were a lot of people there.

45
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:33,646
I guess a lot of people
have problems like I do.

46
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:37,936
Life is tough.

47
00:05:37,936 --> 00:05:41,146
Why are you so depressed?

48
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:43,936
Hey! You didn't tell me anything yet!

49
00:06:06,936 --> 00:06:09,521
It seems like you've improved a lot.

50
00:06:09,521 --> 00:06:12,936
This is all thanks to you, Captain Min.

51
00:06:29,936 --> 00:06:33,271
How do you feel?

52
00:06:33,271 --> 00:06:34,936
Perfect!

53
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:39,771
Good.

54
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:40,936
Bye.

55
00:06:50,104 --> 00:06:55,479
Mr. Min... I mean, Captain Min.

56
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:57,936
Yes?

57
00:06:57,936 --> 00:07:01,936
Did Prince Moonsung practice
martial arts for a long time?

58
00:07:01,936 --> 00:07:06,312
He's been training since childhood.

59
00:07:08,604 --> 00:07:12,187
Is there a shortcut to learning martial arts?

60
00:07:12,187 --> 00:07:14,521
When can I be as good as he is?

61
00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:17,936
Your Highness, martial arts
is about training the mind.

62
00:07:17,936 --> 00:07:21,936
Comparing yourself to someone
else is meaningless.

63
00:07:23,187 --> 00:07:27,646
You mean I have to fight
no one but myself, right?

64
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:29,771
Yes, sir!

65
00:07:46,312 --> 00:07:47,936
Yang Sooneui.

66
00:07:50,688 --> 00:07:52,813
Attendant Yang.

67
00:07:55,146 --> 00:07:58,104
I'll be done soon, Your Highness.

68
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:03,936
Hey... I have something to say.

69
00:08:06,936 --> 00:08:12,312
I... don't want to hear it.

70
00:08:14,936 --> 00:08:16,936
It'll only take a minute.

71
00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:27,104
What is it?

72
00:08:27,146 --> 00:08:29,062
I'm busy. Make it fast.

73
00:08:29,936 --> 00:08:33,146
Uh... remember last time?

74
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:36,438
Last time? When?

75
00:08:36,438 --> 00:08:37,936
You know...

76
00:08:37,936 --> 00:08:40,229
When was that?

77
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:42,936
When I got drunk...

78
00:08:45,187 --> 00:08:48,229
I see.

79
00:08:48,229 --> 00:08:50,229
What about it?

80
00:08:50,271 --> 00:08:55,479
About that kiss...

81
00:09:00,312 --> 00:09:05,646
You see, I didn't mean to...

82
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:08,936
You remembered?

83
00:09:08,936 --> 00:09:13,104
I thought you didn't remember.

84
00:09:13,146 --> 00:09:17,936
Uh... I ended up remembering it.

85
00:09:17,936 --> 00:09:21,936
Ended up remembering it?

86
00:09:24,936 --> 00:09:27,936
Just forget about it.

87
00:09:27,936 --> 00:09:29,936
I already did.

88
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,896
How can you forget something like that?

89
00:09:31,896 --> 00:09:34,979
You didn't remember anyway!

90
00:09:35,062 --> 00:09:37,104
But you ended up remembering it.

91
00:09:37,104 --> 00:09:40,229
Too bad for you.

92
00:09:40,312 --> 00:09:43,229
Don't say that.

93
00:09:43,229 --> 00:09:46,936
I'm trying to apologize.
Why are you so upset?

94
00:09:46,936 --> 00:09:50,187
I said I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

95
00:09:50,187 --> 00:09:54,020
That's why I'm upset, you dork!

96
00:09:54,104 --> 00:09:59,936
What do you mean?

97
00:09:59,936 --> 00:10:03,936
Forget it. I have to go.

98
00:10:05,936 --> 00:10:07,936
You should rest.

99
00:10:07,936 --> 00:10:13,271
You're probably tired from giving
apologies every time you kiss.

100
00:10:28,062 --> 00:10:29,936
You should get ready, Your Highness.

101
00:10:29,936 --> 00:10:32,354
You'll be late for school.

102
00:10:32,354 --> 00:10:33,936
Okay.

103
00:10:38,936 --> 00:10:41,479
Prince Youngsung.

104
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,855
Prince Youngsung!

105
00:10:52,936 --> 00:10:57,187
This is a quote from
Yeonam Park Ji-Won's book.

106
00:10:57,187 --> 00:11:00,936
Why don't you interpret it for us?

107
00:11:02,936 --> 00:11:04,936
The dung beetle cherishes its own dung roll.

108
00:11:04,936 --> 00:11:06,936
It does not envy the dragon's pearl.

109
00:11:06,936 --> 00:11:10,936
The dragon also does not look down
on the dung beetle's dung roll...

110
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:14,936
I wasn't asking you.

111
00:11:14,936 --> 00:11:19,438
It's a metaphor about seeing
things the way they are.

112
00:11:19,438 --> 00:11:25,396
We can do that if we free
ourselves from intolerance.

113
00:11:25,396 --> 00:11:27,936
We seem to have a lot of deaf students here.

114
00:11:27,936 --> 00:11:30,855
I asked Prince Yi Hoo.

115
00:11:32,937 --> 00:11:39,936
Horse dung is horse dung...

116
00:11:39,936 --> 00:11:43,187
Dragons with their pearls...

117
00:11:43,187 --> 00:11:47,936
The dung beetle doesn't think...

118
00:11:47,936 --> 00:11:56,312
the dragon's pearl is any
better than its dung roll...

119
00:11:56,312 --> 00:12:02,936
I think it means you don't have to
think you're better than someone else...

120
00:12:02,936 --> 00:12:08,936
Or feel as though someone's better than you.

121
00:12:10,936 --> 00:12:15,936
Like I always say, you
don't have to use big words.

122
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:21,312
It'll be great if you interpret it easy
enough for a 10 year-old to understand.

123
00:12:21,312 --> 00:12:26,187
Everything in this world is unique.

124
00:12:26,187 --> 00:12:29,396
You can't determine whether
something's superior by one standard...

125
00:12:38,936 --> 00:12:40,936
Whatever!

126
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,936
Why are you taking this?

127
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,438
Bye.

128
00:12:53,438 --> 00:12:55,936
Why are you taking this?

129
00:12:55,936 --> 00:12:58,936
What do you mean, why? It's mine!

130
00:12:58,936 --> 00:13:01,936
No, you gave it to me!

131
00:13:01,936 --> 00:13:06,936
I never gave anything to you!

132
00:13:06,936 --> 00:13:09,979
You gave it to me! I want it back!

133
00:13:09,979 --> 00:13:14,271
No! Are you trying to kill it?

134
00:13:14,271 --> 00:13:16,563
What do you mean, I'm trying to kill it?

135
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,936
Give it to me. It was a gift.

136
00:13:18,979 --> 00:13:25,521
If you want a gift,
go to Shin Saeryung or whatever.

137
00:13:27,146 --> 00:13:32,936
What are you bringing
Miss Saeryung's name up for?

138
00:13:32,936 --> 00:13:34,062
That's all just a misunderstanding!

139
00:13:34,187 --> 00:13:35,936
Whatever, you dork!

140
00:13:35,936 --> 00:13:38,062
Dork?

141
00:13:41,936 --> 00:13:45,438
Attendant Yang. What are you doing?

142
00:13:45,438 --> 00:13:47,271
Lady Han...

143
00:13:47,271 --> 00:13:50,771
Follow me.

144
00:13:50,771 --> 00:13:52,979
Uh...

145
00:14:07,104 --> 00:14:12,229
I warned you about your scandalous behavior!

146
00:14:12,271 --> 00:14:17,229
How can you talk to His Highness
as if he's your friend?

147
00:14:17,229 --> 00:14:20,936
That's so imprudent!

148
00:14:20,979 --> 00:14:22,604
I'm sorry.

149
00:14:22,604 --> 00:14:28,146
I don't think you're speaking to
His Highness in honorifics.

150
00:14:28,146 --> 00:14:32,020
How imprudent is that?

151
00:14:34,936 --> 00:14:37,646
This will never happen again.

152
00:14:39,936 --> 00:14:41,936
Keep this in mind.

153
00:14:45,062 --> 00:14:52,646
You're nothing but an attendant
who serves His Highness.

154
00:14:52,646 --> 00:14:55,813
Yes, Lady Han.

155
00:14:55,813 --> 00:15:02,936
Never mind the outside world.
There's a class distinction in the palace!

156
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:07,936
- Understand?
- Yes, Lady Han.

157
00:15:17,936 --> 00:15:19,936
Yang Sooneui.

158
00:15:28,146 --> 00:15:31,936
I'm sorry.

159
00:15:31,936 --> 00:15:37,271
After all, I'm just an attendant.

160
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:40,187
I shouldn't have done that.

161
00:15:40,187 --> 00:15:45,936
From now on, I will use honorific speech.

162
00:16:14,936 --> 00:16:16,312
Attendant Ma!

163
00:16:16,354 --> 00:16:18,936
Attendant Ma!

164
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,936
You're taking a nap?

165
00:16:21,936 --> 00:16:24,521
Do you know they're recruiting
attendants for the Royal Academy?

166
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:27,062
What? Already?

167
00:16:27,146 --> 00:16:28,979
The deadline's coming up.

168
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,936
If you're interested, you should apply.

169
00:16:32,936 --> 00:16:35,936
Here's the pamphlet.

170
00:16:40,604 --> 00:16:44,354
Poor thing... He's still bitter
about the Royal Academy.

171
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:48,646
Why is he so interested in recruiting
attendants for the Royal Academy?

172
00:16:55,979 --> 00:16:58,729
Attendant Yang.

173
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,937
What's this?

174
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:11,646
I got you some books that'll help you
with the Royal Academy entrance exam.

175
00:17:13,936 --> 00:17:16,936
How did you know?

176
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:19,936
I have my ways.

177
00:17:19,936 --> 00:17:22,563
I thought you'd want to be a
Royal Academy attendant.

178
00:17:22,563 --> 00:17:24,936
Am I wrong?

179
00:17:25,936 --> 00:17:27,936
Study hard.

180
00:17:27,936 --> 00:17:32,936
It'll be nice to see your face
at the Royal Academy.

181
00:17:32,936 --> 00:17:36,979
Thank you, but I'm studying for it on my own.

182
00:17:36,979 --> 00:17:41,396
I can't keep this book.

183
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,936
Then, give it back to me later.

184
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:04,020
What's that?

185
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,187
Are you studying?

186
00:18:07,229 --> 00:18:10,146
Yes, I am.

187
00:18:10,146 --> 00:18:13,563
Really? Need help?

188
00:18:15,187 --> 00:18:17,187
I've improved a lot.

189
00:18:17,187 --> 00:18:20,271
I can speak English now. Want to hear?

190
00:18:20,271 --> 00:18:22,285
May I help you?

191
00:18:24,936 --> 00:18:28,936
That's not good enough to
be the Crown Prince.

192
00:18:28,936 --> 00:18:33,146
People will laugh at you.

193
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:36,604
You should study harder.

194
00:18:41,979 --> 00:18:46,521
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

195
00:18:46,521 --> 00:18:51,229
No, you're right.

196
00:18:51,229 --> 00:18:55,813
Studying isn't for everyone.

197
00:18:57,271 --> 00:19:00,771
I'll be back.

198
00:19:11,688 --> 00:19:14,936
Attendant Ma, Eunuch Kwak is looking for you.

199
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:16,271
Me?

200
00:19:16,354 --> 00:19:18,479
Why?

201
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:20,936
I don't know.

202
00:19:21,937 --> 00:19:23,936
Bye.

203
00:19:32,062 --> 00:19:34,354
Excuse me.

204
00:19:37,936 --> 00:19:41,936
The dress is in the court lady lobby.

205
00:19:41,936 --> 00:19:46,936
You can wait here while I go and get it.

206
00:19:49,936 --> 00:19:52,521
Are you naive or clever?

207
00:19:52,521 --> 00:19:53,813
What?

208
00:19:53,813 --> 00:19:56,936
I heard you're school friends
with Prince Youngsung.

209
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:02,936
You can return the dress to Prince Moonsung.

210
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:05,937
I don't know which one you want...

211
00:20:05,937 --> 00:20:10,146
But, you should at least
know where you stand.

212
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:37,936
Thank you for your concern,
but I think I should return this.

213
00:21:15,062 --> 00:21:19,271
Studying at the Royal Academy to
be a court lady doesn't sound bad.

214
00:21:19,271 --> 00:21:23,396
But, I suck at studying!

215
00:21:26,062 --> 00:21:29,187
Yang Sooneui, you did well
when you were in school, right?

216
00:21:31,936 --> 00:21:34,936
You're not even talking to me.

217
00:21:34,936 --> 00:21:37,936
I already told Eunuch Kwak that
he can't be on my buddy list!

218
00:21:37,936 --> 00:21:40,936
He's asking me again!

219
00:21:40,936 --> 00:21:46,396
Where did you go with that dress?
Did you give it back to her?

220
00:21:49,936 --> 00:21:52,312
I shouldn't have said that.

221
00:21:56,936 --> 00:22:00,855
Do you think you shouldn't
have returned that dress?

222
00:22:00,855 --> 00:22:02,936
Ask for it back!

223
00:22:02,936 --> 00:22:05,729
That'll be too embarrassing.

224
00:22:05,729 --> 00:22:09,229
Yeah, just forget about it.

225
00:22:09,229 --> 00:22:12,936
It's a matter of pride.

226
00:22:12,936 --> 00:22:17,187
He's too simple-minded.
So, he probably forgot about it already.

227
00:22:17,187 --> 00:22:18,936
Good.

228
00:22:21,229 --> 00:22:23,229
I doubt he did.

229
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:27,197
[Prince Hours]

230
00:22:31,104 --> 00:22:32,936
Darn!

231
00:22:39,438 --> 00:22:42,563
You can log onto the
internet and watch TV here.

232
00:22:42,563 --> 00:22:47,729
How do they expect me to
make him use the internet only?

233
00:22:47,729 --> 00:22:49,936
I don't know what to do.

234
00:22:53,146 --> 00:22:55,271
What are you doing?

235
00:22:55,271 --> 00:22:59,146
You startled me!

236
00:22:59,187 --> 00:23:02,396
I didn't know you were here.

237
00:23:04,936 --> 00:23:07,062
Help me carry these.

238
00:23:07,104 --> 00:23:09,146
Why?

239
00:23:09,146 --> 00:23:13,062
Lady Han has ordered us to
keep these away from him.

240
00:23:13,062 --> 00:23:16,396
But, these are His Highness's
favorite things.

241
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:19,936
Are you going to disobey Lady Han?

242
00:23:19,936 --> 00:23:21,479
Help me.

243
00:23:21,479 --> 00:23:24,936
I have to go to the Bihyun Tower.

244
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:26,936
You should've told me earlier.

245
00:23:26,936 --> 00:23:29,896
Go ahead.

246
00:23:45,936 --> 00:23:48,146
What brings you here, Your Highness?

247
00:23:48,146 --> 00:23:53,936
I can't find my motorcycle
and delivery cases.

248
00:23:53,936 --> 00:23:55,936
Did you take them away, Eunuch Kwak?

249
00:23:55,936 --> 00:23:57,936
Pardon?

250
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,936
Well, you see...

251
00:24:00,936 --> 00:24:04,936
You shouldn't ride the motorcycle
because it's dangerous.

252
00:24:04,936 --> 00:24:10,936
I ordered for things that do not fit
your status to be taken away.

253
00:24:10,936 --> 00:24:13,936
They're very important to me.

254
00:24:13,936 --> 00:24:15,354
Give them back, please.

255
00:24:15,438 --> 00:24:17,688
I can't.

256
00:24:17,688 --> 00:24:20,936
The Imperial Court has its customs.

257
00:24:20,936 --> 00:24:23,563
Customs?

258
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:25,936
I don't know what they are.

259
00:24:25,936 --> 00:24:30,146
But, taking my delivery cases and motorcycle
away from me is like throwing myself away.

260
00:24:30,146 --> 00:24:36,813
Do you want to stay as a
black-bean noodle delivery boy?

261
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:41,936
It's time for your study session.

262
00:24:41,936 --> 00:24:45,688
You should go to the Bihyun Tower.

263
00:24:45,688 --> 00:24:50,936
Eunuch Kwak, don't just stand there.
Escort His Highness.

264
00:24:50,936 --> 00:24:52,104
Yes, ma'am.

265
00:24:57,771 --> 00:25:01,354
You must dismiss worldly thoughts
and concentrate on studying.

266
00:25:04,062 --> 00:25:08,936
I can't concentrate. These
words don't stay in my head.

267
00:25:08,936 --> 00:25:10,062
Attendant Yang.

268
00:25:10,062 --> 00:25:11,936
Yes, Lady Han.

269
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:15,936
Bring the Korean history books.

270
00:25:15,936 --> 00:25:20,936
They're collections of exemplary
works from former kings.

271
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:25,771
Uh... Lady Han?

272
00:25:25,771 --> 00:25:27,936
I'm sorry.

273
00:25:27,936 --> 00:25:31,936
I don't have them.

274
00:25:31,936 --> 00:25:36,271
I've only been ordered to
prepare the Book of Odes.

275
00:25:36,271 --> 00:25:39,146
What?

276
00:25:39,146 --> 00:25:41,396
You didn't tell her, Eunuch Kwak?

277
00:25:41,396 --> 00:25:46,354
I did!

278
00:25:46,354 --> 00:25:50,936
Are you lying, Attendant Yang?

279
00:25:54,146 --> 00:25:56,936
I'm sorry.

280
00:25:56,936 --> 00:25:59,979
I must've forgotten.

281
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,438
This is His Highness' study session.

282
00:26:02,438 --> 00:26:05,896
You are his attendant.

283
00:26:05,896 --> 00:26:11,020
I can't believe you didn't
even prepare his books!

284
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,936
Don't just sit there!

285
00:26:12,936 --> 00:26:15,936
- Go and find them!
- Yes, ma'am.

286
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:18,396
Wait, Attendant Yang.

287
00:26:21,062 --> 00:26:22,936
Stop it.

288
00:26:24,936 --> 00:26:26,936
I don't feel like studying today.

289
00:26:28,936 --> 00:26:31,229
I'd like to go outside for a walk.

290
00:26:31,229 --> 00:26:36,855
No, you must not neglect your studies.

291
00:26:36,855 --> 00:26:42,936
You must be born again to fit your status.

292
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:47,104
The status of royalty is
bestowed by heaven.

293
00:26:47,104 --> 00:26:50,936
You're different from commoners.

294
00:26:50,936 --> 00:26:53,813
My mom was a commoner too.

295
00:26:55,936 --> 00:27:00,896
That's more reason for you to be dignified.

296
00:27:06,187 --> 00:27:09,521
- I better get going.
- Sit down, Your Highness.

297
00:27:09,521 --> 00:27:10,936
It'll only take a short while.

298
00:27:10,936 --> 00:27:13,936
Listen, Your Highness.

299
00:27:13,936 --> 00:27:24,062
Her Majesty entrusted me as the chief
of Jipyoung Tower and to be your teacher.

300
00:27:24,062 --> 00:27:33,312
Everything I say inside Jipyoung Tower
is like speaking on behalf of Her Majesty.

301
00:27:33,312 --> 00:27:36,936
Sit down, Your Highness.

302
00:27:36,936 --> 00:27:39,104
I don't feel like studying today.

303
00:27:41,104 --> 00:27:43,936
I'm sorry, Lady Han.

304
00:27:57,936 --> 00:28:00,936
Your Majesty, Prince Youngsung is here.

305
00:28:10,936 --> 00:28:13,604
I heard you asked for me, Your Majesty.

306
00:28:13,604 --> 00:28:15,688
Prince Youngsung.

307
00:28:15,688 --> 00:28:17,937
Yes, Your Majesty.

308
00:28:26,936 --> 00:28:30,936
How come you didn't listen to Lady Han?

309
00:28:33,146 --> 00:28:38,062
She may be strict,
but you must listen to her.

310
00:28:40,187 --> 00:28:46,563
I couldn't stand how she threw away
my possessions without my permission.

311
00:28:46,563 --> 00:28:54,688
They may look like trash to someone else,
but I have fond memories of them.

312
00:28:54,688 --> 00:29:00,271
I felt as though those memories
were being looked down upon.

313
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:01,936
I'm sorry.

314
00:29:09,936 --> 00:29:11,271
Are you having a tough time?

315
00:29:18,936 --> 00:29:20,604
You are.

316
00:29:22,146 --> 00:29:24,936
I don't know...

317
00:29:24,936 --> 00:29:27,937
I don't know if I'm cut out to be a royal.

318
00:29:29,979 --> 00:29:34,646
I'm sorry...

319
00:29:34,646 --> 00:29:40,563
But, please give me some time
to adjust to the palace.

320
00:29:42,604 --> 00:29:44,936
I'll try my best, too.

321
00:29:49,146 --> 00:29:53,146
You took Prince Youngsung's things away?

322
00:29:53,146 --> 00:29:56,062
That was too harsh.

323
00:29:56,062 --> 00:29:59,396
He'll run away if you're too strict.

324
00:30:02,521 --> 00:30:08,438
Why don't you be more
considerate of how he feels?

325
00:30:08,438 --> 00:30:21,438
My duty is to make sure he leaves his
old life behind and act like a royal.

326
00:30:21,438 --> 00:30:23,936
Please understand me.

327
00:30:23,936 --> 00:30:26,936
Lady Han.

328
00:30:26,936 --> 00:30:33,936
He must have some positive traits since
he was raised outside the palace.

329
00:30:33,936 --> 00:30:39,936
I'm only getting to know him,
but he's very pure in heart.

330
00:30:39,936 --> 00:30:42,354
Don't you agree?

331
00:30:42,354 --> 00:30:45,936
I don't know what to say, Your Highness.

332
00:30:45,936 --> 00:30:51,604
If you guide him well,
he will bear much fruit.

333
00:30:51,604 --> 00:30:59,936
I'd like you to be strict, but I don't
want you to hurt his feelings.

334
00:31:00,936 --> 00:31:04,020
I'll keep that in mind, Your Highness.

335
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:45,521
What if Prince Youngsung never
qualifies to be Crown Prince?

336
00:31:45,521 --> 00:31:49,936
That could happen if that's
where Prince Moonsung belongs.

337
00:31:51,936 --> 00:31:54,936
Mother!

338
00:31:54,936 --> 00:31:59,062
An emperor is mandated from heaven.

339
00:31:59,062 --> 00:32:03,936
No one expected you to become the Empress.

340
00:32:03,936 --> 00:32:07,187
But not Prince Moonsung.

341
00:32:07,187 --> 00:32:09,896
Why do you dislike him so much?

342
00:32:09,896 --> 00:32:12,937
I don't dislike him.

343
00:32:12,937 --> 00:32:16,479
You know how ambitious
Grand Prince Hyojang is!

344
00:32:16,479 --> 00:32:21,936
It's ambition that's out of spite!

345
00:32:21,936 --> 00:32:24,146
How can we entrust the
Imperial Court's future

346
00:32:24,146 --> 00:32:28,396
to someone of such a dark background?

347
00:32:28,396 --> 00:32:34,020
Prince Youngsung wasn't from
a cheerful background either.

348
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:34,937
But...

349
00:32:34,937 --> 00:32:40,229
The more I see him, the more
he reminds me of his mother.

350
00:32:42,936 --> 00:32:48,936
I hope the Imperial Court is
not being too greedy again.

351
00:32:51,312 --> 00:32:55,936
A brighter light brings a darker shadow.

352
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,936
It always bothers me to think that...

353
00:33:00,936 --> 00:33:12,855
someone so genuinely cheerful left
because her heart was so wounded.

354
00:33:53,229 --> 00:33:56,936
How did you know I was here?

355
00:33:56,936 --> 00:33:59,979
I looked everywhere where I might find you.

356
00:34:02,896 --> 00:34:06,354
Yang Sooneui, please.

357
00:34:06,354 --> 00:34:10,187
You can drop the honorifics when we're alone.

358
00:34:10,187 --> 00:34:12,187
I'm already suffocating here.

359
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:20,936
What happened?

360
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:23,271
Like what?

361
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:30,229
I heard Her Majesty summoned you
because of what had happened earlier.

362
00:34:32,187 --> 00:34:33,936
Nothing happened.

363
00:34:36,936 --> 00:34:39,521
Life's tough.

364
00:34:40,855 --> 00:34:47,604
Nothing ever works out. You know me.

365
00:34:47,604 --> 00:34:50,936
I can't do anything.

366
00:34:50,936 --> 00:34:54,936
I've caused nothing but
trouble to Her Majesty.

367
00:34:54,936 --> 00:34:56,396
And to you, too.

368
00:34:56,396 --> 00:35:00,646
Hey, listen.

369
00:35:00,646 --> 00:35:04,896
Everyone causes trouble for
other people. Understand?

370
00:35:04,896 --> 00:35:11,521
You can't always be good to
everyone. That's impossible!

371
00:35:11,521 --> 00:35:14,936
That's how everyone is.

372
00:35:16,937 --> 00:35:21,187
You're alright! Trust me on this.

373
00:35:21,187 --> 00:35:24,936
You're not that bad.

374
00:35:24,936 --> 00:35:28,936
You can be Crown Prince any day if you want!

375
00:35:28,936 --> 00:35:33,062
And, you can cause trouble for me, okay?

376
00:35:34,936 --> 00:35:36,936
Ha!

377
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:54,936
Hey, about what happened here... I'm sorry.

378
00:35:54,936 --> 00:35:59,936
You already apologized.

379
00:35:59,936 --> 00:36:00,936
It's okay.

380
00:36:00,936 --> 00:36:06,937
I said I didn't mean it because
I was drunk, but I take it back.

381
00:36:06,937 --> 00:36:13,936
I think I did it because I was
happy and grateful to have you.

382
00:36:13,936 --> 00:36:15,604
I'm serious.

383
00:36:15,604 --> 00:36:18,855
It's okay.

384
00:36:18,855 --> 00:36:20,813
We're still young.

385
00:36:20,813 --> 00:36:23,187
We can make mistakes.

386
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:32,936
I'll cherish it.

387
00:36:34,936 --> 00:36:36,936
When I get married later...

388
00:36:36,936 --> 00:36:41,936
I can look back to my first kiss
with the Crown Prince and smile.

389
00:36:43,936 --> 00:36:47,354
I might even tell that to my kids.

390
00:36:52,917 --> 00:36:53,417
Oh...

391
00:36:54,655 --> 00:36:58,167
You and Saeryung look cute together.

392
00:36:58,312 --> 00:37:00,936
Go for it.

393
00:37:00,936 --> 00:37:04,855
Don't mind the kiss with me.

394
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:08,936
- That's a misunderstanding.
- I better go.

395
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:13,438
Don't make everyone look for you.
You should go back soon.

396
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:22,936
Kang Hoo! You got this!

397
00:37:36,146 --> 00:37:39,936
Kang Hoo, you got this...

398
00:37:39,936 --> 00:37:41,936
Kang Hoo, you got this...

399
00:38:02,354 --> 00:38:07,646
Are you just going to sit back and watch?

400
00:38:07,646 --> 00:38:12,936
It'll take forever for Joon to
become Crown Prince at this rate.

401
00:38:12,936 --> 00:38:15,438
Don't be so hasty, dear.

402
00:38:15,438 --> 00:38:18,312
I'm already working on it.

403
00:38:18,312 --> 00:38:19,936
Working on what?

404
00:38:19,936 --> 00:38:26,020
I'm thinking about adding a little flavor.

405
00:38:26,062 --> 00:38:32,146
People are bound to agonize over their roots.

406
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:39,604
Do you think he can stay where he is

407
00:38:39,604 --> 00:38:43,229
after finding out his mother was
abandoned by the Imperial Court?

408
00:38:43,229 --> 00:38:50,604
When a naive child starts to doubt,
no one can stop his skepticism.

409
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:59,936
I will throw a rock into a pond.
You can continue throwing stones.

410
00:38:59,936 --> 00:39:06,062
Are you going to bring up the
foundation's bribery scandal?

411
00:39:06,146 --> 00:39:08,936
I don't think that'll be necessary.

412
00:39:08,936 --> 00:39:11,229
How unlike you to say that.

413
00:39:11,229 --> 00:39:12,646
What I mean is...

414
00:39:12,646 --> 00:39:15,813
Don't worry.

415
00:39:15,813 --> 00:39:18,936
The arrow has already left the bow.

416
00:39:36,936 --> 00:39:40,936
Your Highness. Grand Prince Hyojang is here.

417
00:39:50,936 --> 00:39:52,936
What brings you here?

418
00:39:52,936 --> 00:39:57,936
I came by to see Joon,
but he wasn't in his room.

419
00:39:57,936 --> 00:40:03,104
I heard you went through a lot
before entering the palace.

420
00:40:03,104 --> 00:40:06,271
Even your life was in danger, right?

421
00:40:06,271 --> 00:40:08,354
How did you know?

422
00:40:08,354 --> 00:40:11,271
I'm a member of the Imperial Court, too.

423
00:40:11,271 --> 00:40:16,936
How can we call ourselves
family if I don't know that?

424
00:40:16,936 --> 00:40:21,354
I feel bad for not having paid attention
to a family member all this time.

425
00:40:21,396 --> 00:40:23,936
It's my fault.

426
00:40:23,936 --> 00:40:30,521
I feel bad for not visiting
you formally, Your Highness.

427
00:40:30,521 --> 00:40:32,271
I'm your uncle.

428
00:40:32,271 --> 00:40:35,146
Call me "Uncle" when we're talking privately.

429
00:40:35,146 --> 00:40:37,813
Yes, Uncle.

430
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:41,936
Prince Youngsung.

431
00:40:43,187 --> 00:40:47,936
I came here to tell you to cheer up.

432
00:40:47,936 --> 00:40:54,937
Your second cousin, Her Majesty,
is always surrounded by danger.

433
00:40:54,937 --> 00:40:59,936
Many people want her to
step down from the throne.

434
00:40:59,936 --> 00:41:03,936
The Imperial Court itself
will be jeopardized

435
00:41:03,936 --> 00:41:09,896
if you and Prince Moonsung
do not support Her Majesty.

436
00:41:09,896 --> 00:41:16,936
Her Majesty will soon select
one of you as Crown Prince.

437
00:41:18,146 --> 00:41:21,936
I'm still not qualified.

438
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:25,936
Prince Moonsung should be Crown Prince.

439
00:41:25,936 --> 00:41:28,062
Don't say that.

440
00:41:28,146 --> 00:41:31,479
You're qualified as well.

441
00:41:34,936 --> 00:41:41,146
Are you willing to do anything
for Her Majesty?

442
00:41:41,187 --> 00:41:47,062
If so, you should equip yourself to be
Crown Prince as soon as you can.

443
00:41:47,062 --> 00:41:53,187
That way you can properly compete
against Prince Moonsung.

444
00:41:53,229 --> 00:41:59,396
To be honest, this is strange and scary.

445
00:41:59,396 --> 00:42:01,936
Don't be afraid.

446
00:42:03,936 --> 00:42:07,563
Although you were a
Chinese noodle delivery boy...

447
00:42:07,563 --> 00:42:11,187
that could work to your advantage.

448
00:42:11,187 --> 00:42:17,312
Even your mother adjusted to life here.

449
00:42:19,936 --> 00:42:22,936
I'm sure you heard this as well...

450
00:42:22,936 --> 00:42:29,312
But, I'm sure the bribery scandal
was all a misunderstanding.

451
00:42:29,312 --> 00:42:34,271
I trust you will work hard for
the future of the Imperial Court.

452
00:42:34,271 --> 00:42:40,936
and the people, and not
seek the throne for revenge.

453
00:43:00,126 --> 00:43:01,460
What is this?

454
00:43:02,812 --> 00:43:05,933
It's called "Brilliant Soup."
It'll clear your head.

455
00:43:06,132 --> 00:43:07,908
Really?

456
00:43:10,355 --> 00:43:13,718
Oh my. I hate things that are bitter-tasting.

457
00:43:13,718 --> 00:43:15,589
I'm only drinking it because you brought it.

458
00:43:18,853 --> 00:43:21,259
I hope it works.

459
00:43:25,672 --> 00:43:26,372
Oh, it's so bitter!

460
00:43:36,315 --> 00:43:39,916
Hey, do you remember my mom?

461
00:43:41,288 --> 00:43:43,806
Of course I do.

462
00:43:43,806 --> 00:43:46,070
My mom was a good person, right?

463
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:53,454
She was gentle, nice, kind, and pretty!

464
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:56,547
She's not the type to deceive others, right?

465
00:43:58,954 --> 00:44:00,522
Why do you boast about
your mom all of a sudden?

466
00:44:02,665 --> 00:44:13,919
That's right... I've never seen anyone
as pure and angelic as she was.

467
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:16,545
You're just as pure.

468
00:44:17,737 --> 00:44:19,175
Is that an insult or compliment?

469
00:44:19,244 --> 00:44:20,528
It's an insult.

470
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,503
How will you handle this tough life?

471
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:27,268
I'll be able to handle it well on
my own. Don't you worry.

472
00:44:27,483 --> 00:44:30,325
If you put it that way, I'll be sad.

473
00:44:32,024 --> 00:44:33,992
Don't act as if you care.

474
00:44:36,379 --> 00:44:39,062
Oh, I have to go now.

475
00:44:40,294 --> 00:44:40,880
Hey.

476
00:44:41,815 --> 00:44:43,361
Don't be like that and hang out a bit longer.

477
00:44:43,439 --> 00:44:46,247
Why are you being like this? So childish.

478
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:50,266
Hey... Just hang out a bit longer.

479
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:51,688
I can't!

480
00:44:52,182 --> 00:44:52,849
Study!

481
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,260
Oh my!

482
00:45:08,962 --> 00:45:10,977
I didn't realize you were here.

483
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:14,314
I'll leave the mail for you.

484
00:45:21,548 --> 00:45:22,895
Do you like music?

485
00:45:27,207 --> 00:45:29,634
Yes, I do.

486
00:45:42,035 --> 00:45:43,508
Miss Yang Sooneui.

487
00:45:43,508 --> 00:45:44,008
Yes?

488
00:45:45,027 --> 00:45:46,617
What kind of person do I seem like to you?

489
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,682
Do I seem like a good
person... or a bad person?

490
00:45:53,561 --> 00:45:55,969
You're a good person.

491
00:45:56,352 --> 00:45:58,045
I'm really a bad person.

492
00:45:59,782 --> 00:46:03,532
I need to have everything I desire.

493
00:46:05,758 --> 00:46:07,704
However, I don't like playing dirty.

494
00:46:08,796 --> 00:46:11,049
I want to obtain things the proper way.

495
00:46:11,356 --> 00:46:14,013
Yes, that's a good idea.

496
00:46:41,647 --> 00:46:44,253
Oh, Saeryung! You're done with class, right?

497
00:46:44,456 --> 00:46:45,549
What are you doing today?

498
00:46:45,549 --> 00:46:48,686
If you're free, want to
come watch a performance?

499
00:46:48,838 --> 00:46:51,454
Sorry, I have to meet Prince Youngsung.

500
00:46:51,454 --> 00:46:52,827
Oh really?

501
00:46:53,024 --> 00:46:56,582
It's hard helping him at the
Academy and the palace, right?

502
00:46:56,951 --> 00:47:02,684
But I heard Prince Youngsung
isn't that bright. Is that true?

503
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,214
Why don't you watch your words.

504
00:47:05,214 --> 00:47:07,967
We're just concerned about you, that's all.

505
00:47:08,085 --> 00:47:11,672
Joon was admitted early and planning to
graduate early.

506
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:14,410
But can he even pass this academic year?

507
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:17,176
Are you putting me down?

508
00:47:18,442 --> 00:47:21,786
Oh, right... You are helping him.

509
00:47:23,372 --> 00:47:25,183
I'll see you later.

510
00:47:31,062 --> 00:47:32,695
You haven't even read half.

511
00:47:34,937 --> 00:47:38,271
I tried, but...

512
00:47:41,936 --> 00:47:44,979
Why don't you read it out loud?

513
00:47:44,979 --> 00:47:46,936
What?

514
00:47:46,936 --> 00:47:48,729
It'll be easier to memorize

515
00:47:48,729 --> 00:47:51,020
because you'll be stimulating both
your sight and auditory senses.

516
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:54,229
Oh, so that's what that was about.

517
00:47:54,229 --> 00:47:59,936
When I was little, my mom used to tell me
to read out loud if I couldn't concentrate.

518
00:47:59,936 --> 00:48:01,936
Did you do what she said?

519
00:48:01,936 --> 00:48:05,936
No, I begged her to read it for me.

520
00:48:05,936 --> 00:48:09,936
Funny enough, only the books she
read to me stayed in my head.

521
00:48:09,936 --> 00:48:16,563
That's why I remember plenty of stories
but not their titles and authors.

522
00:48:16,563 --> 00:48:19,936
Titles and authors aren't as important
as the stories themselves.

523
00:48:19,936 --> 00:48:23,936
You're right, but when I
was a delivery boy...

524
00:48:23,936 --> 00:48:27,229
I couldn't act like I knew things because
then people might call me a know-it-all.

525
00:48:27,229 --> 00:48:32,187
Now, I can't say anything because I
only know things on the surface.

526
00:48:32,187 --> 00:48:33,936
This is so confusing.

527
00:48:36,936 --> 00:48:43,271
Thank you for acting as though
nothing has happened.

528
00:48:43,271 --> 00:48:47,271
To be honest, I do feel a little uneasy.

529
00:48:47,271 --> 00:48:50,936
Same here, even though I try
hard not to feel that way.

530
00:48:50,936 --> 00:48:54,563
We'll get over it. Don't worry.

531
00:48:57,104 --> 00:48:59,187
Do you want me to read it for you?

532
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:00,396
Really?

533
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:02,327
Just for today.

534
00:49:02,327 --> 00:49:03,913
Starting from here.

535
00:49:07,936 --> 00:49:10,324
In the 25th year Imjin of
Sunjo on April 13th...

536
00:49:10,936 --> 00:49:18,062
Konishi Yukinaga led 18,000 soldiers on
350 ships and landed on Busan harbor.

537
00:49:18,062 --> 00:49:22,688
In 1580, Lee Hangbok passed
the civil service examination.

538
00:49:22,688 --> 00:49:23,936
He apprenticed and the following

539
00:49:23,936 --> 00:49:26,312
year became a censor.

540
00:49:26,312 --> 00:49:28,936
In 1583, he became a historian and editor,

541
00:49:28,936 --> 00:49:35,020
and held various scholarly titles.

542
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:37,604
In 1589, as the Minister of
Culture and Education,

543
00:49:37,604 --> 00:49:40,187
he quashed the rebellion of Jeong Yeo-rip.

544
00:49:40,187 --> 00:49:44,521
For that, he became a third-ranked vassal
of merit and served other positions.

545
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:34,979
You haven't played the
guitar for a while now.

546
00:50:34,979 --> 00:50:36,936
What happened?

547
00:50:40,813 --> 00:50:48,936
Let's quit now, before it's too late.

548
00:50:52,396 --> 00:50:54,936
What do you mean?

549
00:51:02,146 --> 00:51:05,936
The kiss with Prince Moonsung
didn't mean anything.

550
00:51:05,936 --> 00:51:09,104
I was just drunk.

551
00:51:09,229 --> 00:51:11,936
I thought you'd understand.

552
00:51:13,354 --> 00:51:15,062
I'm sorry.

553
00:51:17,187 --> 00:51:22,396
I thought I could spend
the rest of my life with you.

554
00:51:25,062 --> 00:51:29,855
We've known each other since we were kids.

555
00:51:32,936 --> 00:51:35,729
But, I don't think this is right.

556
00:51:35,729 --> 00:51:39,312
It's wrong for both of us.

557
00:51:43,855 --> 00:51:46,354
You're just going through a phase.

558
00:51:46,354 --> 00:51:48,936
I can understand.

559
00:51:51,104 --> 00:51:54,936
Do you love me?

560
00:52:01,062 --> 00:52:04,936
Right, I can't tell you I love you.

561
00:52:06,979 --> 00:52:08,937
But, I do like you.

562
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:11,855
Isn't that enough?

563
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:20,936
You know you can't get
together with an attendant.

564
00:52:20,936 --> 00:52:23,936
It's not about getting together with her.

565
00:52:26,937 --> 00:52:32,020
I don't think I can get engaged like this.

566
00:52:35,229 --> 00:52:41,062
Do you think the adults will
let you do what you want?

567
00:52:41,104 --> 00:52:43,729
That's why I'm asking you for a favor.

568
00:52:48,936 --> 00:52:52,271
I can't.

569
00:52:52,271 --> 00:52:55,936
The engagement will proceed as scheduled.

570
00:52:55,936 --> 00:53:00,688
Even if I don't want it, it's too late now.

571
00:53:35,859 --> 00:53:40,430
[Prince Hours]

572
00:53:42,671 --> 00:53:44,302
Why do you want me to put a
face mask on you all of a sudden?

573
00:53:45,716 --> 00:53:47,328
You can do this yourself.

574
00:53:48,202 --> 00:53:50,243
Hey, it has to be perfect.

575
00:53:50,243 --> 00:53:54,851
I've been thinking... and being a
royal is like being a celebrity.

576
00:53:55,807 --> 00:53:59,755
We both come out on TV.
So, I need specialized facial care.

577
00:54:05,035 --> 00:54:08,527
Hey, what is this?
I don't like sticky stuff.

578
00:54:09,639 --> 00:54:11,209
It's not sticky, okay?

579
00:54:12,801 --> 00:54:17,254
But because you're tired, your dark
circles come down to your cheeks.

580
00:54:18,269 --> 00:54:19,895
And your skin's in bad shape.

581
00:54:22,083 --> 00:54:27,019
After you apply this, your skin
will be supple like a baby's.

582
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:28,070
Really?

583
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:32,051
Do you use this, too?

584
00:54:33,065 --> 00:54:33,565
Huh?

585
00:54:37,006 --> 00:54:37,761
Sometimes.

586
00:54:38,246 --> 00:54:39,965
Hey, use it every day then!

587
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:42,499
Your dark circles are no joke either!

588
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:50,495
Another face mask?

589
00:54:53,227 --> 00:54:56,569
Hey, be gentle!

590
00:54:56,569 --> 00:54:59,563
If you talk while I'm applying
this, you'll get wrinkles.

591
00:54:59,563 --> 00:55:00,063
Really?

592
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:23,935
Hey! What... Hey!

593
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:25,665
Hey, what are you doing?

594
00:55:27,072 --> 00:55:29,779
Why are you trying to plug up my nostrils?

595
00:55:29,779 --> 00:55:30,279
Sorry!

596
00:55:32,648 --> 00:55:34,298
Do it yourself then.

597
00:55:36,248 --> 00:55:38,085
Why is she being like that all of a sudden?

598
00:55:40,981 --> 00:55:44,200
She should finish what she started.

599
00:55:54,403 --> 00:55:56,403
Is this today's schedule?

600
00:55:56,403 --> 00:55:58,403
That's right.

601
00:55:58,403 --> 00:56:01,487
You look great, Your Highness.

602
00:56:01,529 --> 00:56:04,404
I'll get the car ready.

603
00:56:04,404 --> 00:56:06,487
Sure.

604
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:09,404
You look great today too, Eunuch Kwak.

605
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:21,280
Attendant Yang, do I look cool or what?

606
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,779
And, I thought you were studying hard.

607
00:56:24,779 --> 00:56:26,821
Are you acting like you're all that again?

608
00:56:26,946 --> 00:56:29,196
Bye.

609
00:56:30,403 --> 00:56:32,030
Hey!

610
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:36,155
His Highness is leaving. Aren't you
going to say a farewell greeting?

611
00:56:38,446 --> 00:56:42,403
- What's this?
- Be careful.

612
00:56:42,403 --> 00:56:46,487
Be careful? Be careful of what?

613
00:56:46,487 --> 00:56:49,779
I don't know.

614
00:56:49,779 --> 00:56:51,738
You always get yourself into trouble.

615
00:56:51,738 --> 00:56:54,404
Speak for yourself.

616
00:56:54,487 --> 00:56:56,403
Bye.

617
00:57:19,403 --> 00:57:23,403
A welcomed guest from the palace
will be here to meet you.

618
00:57:23,403 --> 00:57:25,821
A welcomed guest?

619
00:57:25,821 --> 00:57:28,403
I don't have anyone like
that from the palace.

620
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,821
I mean the Chinese restaurant.

621
00:57:30,821 --> 00:57:35,403
I invited Mr. Cho Sangki for you.

622
00:57:35,403 --> 00:57:37,238
Really?

623
00:57:37,238 --> 00:57:39,403
Oh! You're right!

624
00:57:41,571 --> 00:57:44,403
Mr. Cho! Are you here?

625
00:57:44,403 --> 00:57:47,529
You're here because you missed me, right?

626
00:57:47,529 --> 00:57:49,988
Where are you?

627
00:57:55,403 --> 00:57:57,403
Hello.

628
00:58:13,446 --> 00:58:15,403
Madam Chamberlain.

629
00:58:18,403 --> 00:58:21,196
We're ready.

630
00:58:21,196 --> 00:58:24,529
Then, I'll see you in the auction room.

631
00:58:30,487 --> 00:58:32,404
Mr. Cho!

632
00:58:38,403 --> 00:58:41,363
- Excuse me.
- That's fine.

633
00:58:44,403 --> 00:58:45,905
Are you okay, Your Highness?

634
00:58:45,905 --> 00:58:47,738
Yes.

635
00:58:47,738 --> 00:58:51,613
That man looks familiar. Where did I see him?

636
00:58:54,363 --> 00:58:56,446
That's him!

637
00:58:56,571 --> 00:59:00,155
He's the guy who tried to kidnap me!

638
00:59:03,988 --> 00:59:06,403
Your Majesty.

639
00:59:10,403 --> 00:59:13,779
Professor Esterhazy is here.

640
00:59:29,403 --> 00:59:32,403
Let me excuse myself.

641
00:59:49,696 --> 00:59:51,348
Long time no see.

642
00:59:51,348 --> 00:59:53,384
Seven years and two months.

643
00:59:54,403 --> 00:59:57,738
How have you been?

644
00:59:58,852 --> 01:00:00,845
I've been good. Thank you.

645
01:00:04,322 --> 01:00:06,814
Why did you come to Korea?

646
01:00:06,814 --> 01:00:10,505
I was offered a great position at
the Royal Academy, so I took it.

647
01:00:11,175 --> 01:00:12,754
Nothing else, Your Highness.

648
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:21,557
Your eyes seem to blame me. You look bitter.

649
01:00:21,719 --> 01:00:26,720
I did blame you. But, you seem
to have forgotten all about me.

650
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:30,263
And, you moved on, so I did the same.

651
01:00:30,529 --> 01:00:33,403
I didn't forget anything.

652
01:00:33,403 --> 01:00:35,821
It wasn't easy for me either!

653
01:00:35,821 --> 01:00:39,988
Alex! Can't you try to understand me?

654
01:01:05,476 --> 01:01:05,976
Stop!

655
01:01:34,654 --> 01:01:37,403
Tell me what you're up to!

656
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:43,446
I'm going to find out who's behind this.

657
01:01:44,479 --> 01:01:44,979
Yah!

658
01:01:48,529 --> 01:01:51,403
That's a royal martial art move.

659
01:01:51,403 --> 01:01:53,404
Which clan are you from?

660
01:01:55,613 --> 01:01:57,446
We will now auction the teddy bears...

661
01:01:57,446 --> 01:02:03,403
wearing the works of Korea's
most famous designers.

662
01:02:03,403 --> 01:02:04,403
Madam Chamberlain.

663
01:02:04,403 --> 01:02:05,946
Yes, Your Majesty.

664
01:02:05,946 --> 01:02:08,403
Where's the Prince?

665
01:02:08,403 --> 01:02:12,280
We're still looking for him.

666
01:02:24,403 --> 01:02:29,403
What are you guys doing here?
What are you doing?

667
01:02:31,738 --> 01:02:33,403
What are you doing?

668
01:02:33,403 --> 01:02:35,696
- Your Highness!
- Don't move!

669
01:02:35,821 --> 01:02:38,905
If you move, this man will be dead!

670
01:02:45,696 --> 01:02:47,905
Your Highness!

671
01:02:47,905 --> 01:02:50,403
Are you okay?

672
01:02:50,446 --> 01:02:52,030
I'm okay.

673
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:52,964
The auction has begun.

674
01:02:52,964 --> 01:02:54,283
- What is that?
- Empress...

675
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:58,227
Terror plot... going as planned.

676
01:02:59,403 --> 01:03:00,946
Everything's fine.

677
01:03:00,946 --> 01:03:07,403
Target... The Empress'
symbolic object... all set.

678
01:03:16,738 --> 01:03:22,487
Proceeds from today's auction will go to
UNICEF's fund for impoverished children.

679
01:03:22,487 --> 01:03:30,696
I'd like to thank Her Majesty again
for helping us with this auction.

680
01:03:30,696 --> 01:03:33,863
Get ready now.

681
01:03:33,863 --> 01:03:36,403
Preparation complete.

682
01:03:43,155 --> 01:03:44,779
Her Majesty is in danger.

683
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:47,403
A teddy bear with a replica of the
ceremonial dress Her Majesty wore

684
01:03:47,403 --> 01:03:52,738
during her enthronement
will be presented to her.

685
01:03:52,738 --> 01:03:55,404
What symbolizes the Empress?

686
01:03:58,363 --> 01:04:00,403
Stand by.

687
01:04:01,403 --> 01:04:02,574
No!

688
01:04:02,574 --> 01:04:03,074
Hit.

689
01:04:08,113 --> 01:04:09,403
Prince!

690
01:04:11,487 --> 01:04:14,521
Security! Security! Security!

691
01:04:15,403 --> 01:04:16,403
His Highness!

692
01:04:16,403 --> 01:04:19,863
I'm fine. Protect the Prince!

693
01:04:19,863 --> 01:04:20,670
Your Highness!

694
01:04:21,895 --> 01:04:23,097
Your Highness!

695
01:04:23,097 --> 01:04:27,207
His Highness!

696
01:04:51,134 --> 01:04:52,765
[Prince Hours]

697
01:04:54,961 --> 01:04:59,467
Are you sure what happened
has nothing to do with you?

698
01:04:59,467 --> 01:05:04,737
Do you still think you can become Crown
Prince with skill and qualifications alone?

699
01:05:07,185 --> 01:05:10,103
Thanks for your concern.

700
01:05:10,747 --> 01:05:12,238
Are you stupid?

701
01:05:12,238 --> 01:05:15,401
How can I not be concerned?

702
01:05:15,401 --> 01:05:18,564
I thought I would never see you again.

703
01:05:21,230 --> 01:05:24,239
Do you think that's being "fine"?

704
01:05:24,759 --> 01:05:26,534
There is something going on.

705
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:35,608
You're the one who raised Prince
Youngsung after his mother died...

706
01:05:36,143 --> 01:05:39,752
Fate is so cruel.

707
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:47,053
Father, I want to break off the
engagement to Saeryung.

708
01:05:49,331 --> 01:05:51,591
You don't even know who you are!

709
01:05:52,287 --> 01:05:55,584
You need to take care of yourself.

710
01:05:56,055 --> 01:05:59,425
I wonder who would do such thing.
