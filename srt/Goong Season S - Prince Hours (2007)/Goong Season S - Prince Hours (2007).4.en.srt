1
00:00:34,092 --> 00:00:37,239
Excuse me. Who are you?

2
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,848
Your Majesty!

3
00:00:48,636 --> 00:00:50,200
How did you...

4
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:54,316
My brother ran away.

5
00:00:54,316 --> 00:00:58,803
As an older sister, can I
just stay home and wait?

6
00:00:58,803 --> 00:00:59,890
What?

7
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,112
Since I'm out, there is
one place I'd like to go...

8
00:01:04,112 --> 00:01:05,669
Will you go with me?

9
00:02:00,492 --> 00:02:05,139
This place is much too
shabby for Your Majesty.

10
00:02:05,139 --> 00:02:08,599
As insignificant as I am...
I don't know quite what to do.

11
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:13,823
This place seems very familiar to me
since this is where the Prince has lived.

12
00:02:15,787 --> 00:02:19,342
Then, can I have a taste of your noodles?

13
00:02:19,754 --> 00:02:21,498
What?

14
00:02:21,498 --> 00:02:24,170
Black-bean noodles for Your Majesty?

15
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:28,133
To tell you the truth,
I love black-bean noodles.

16
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:32,800
When I was studying abroad,
to eat black-bean noodles,

17
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,193
I had to drive from Oxford to London.

18
00:02:36,193 --> 00:02:39,017
I think it took about an hour and a half?

19
00:02:39,017 --> 00:02:41,888
There was a really good black-bean
noodle place in London.

20
00:02:41,888 --> 00:02:43,129
I see.

21
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,981
May I ask you this favor?

22
00:02:46,776 --> 00:02:49,809
I am awestruck, Your Majesty.

23
00:02:49,809 --> 00:02:54,685
If that's the case,
I will humbly do my best.

24
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:07,320
Timing is the most important
thing with delivery.

25
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,742
Prompt delivery.

26
00:03:19,912 --> 00:03:22,101
Who ordered the black-bean noodles?

27
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:25,661
Madam Chamberlain, does it suit me?

28
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,568
I heard this noodle dish first
started here in Chinatown?

29
00:03:33,568 --> 00:03:35,633
That is so, Your Majesty.

30
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:38,504
About 120 years ago,
it was developed in Incheon

31
00:03:38,504 --> 00:03:42,804
during the time of vigorous
commercial trade with China.

32
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,504
Then, the Prince must also
like black-bean noodles?

33
00:03:48,504 --> 00:03:50,168
Of course!

34
00:03:50,168 --> 00:03:52,648
If I connected all of the noodles I've eaten,

35
00:03:52,648 --> 00:03:54,395
it would go around the
earth quite a few times.

36
00:04:02,088 --> 00:04:03,535
Kang Hoo!

37
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:07,295
- Kang Hoo!
- Kang Hoo!

38
00:04:07,295 --> 00:04:09,646
Hey, you creep! Are you a ghost?

39
00:04:09,646 --> 00:04:10,963
You appear and then disappear.

40
00:04:10,963 --> 00:04:14,427
You worried us! We all looked
for you and were worried!

41
00:04:14,427 --> 00:04:16,853
- Whew! Creep!
- Yikes! Yikes!

42
00:04:16,853 --> 00:04:18,563
You jerk! Darn! Darn!

43
00:04:18,563 --> 00:04:20,173
Hey! Can't you keep quiet?

44
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:21,381
Hey! Hey!

45
00:04:21,381 --> 00:04:24,638
But, who is this girl?

46
00:04:24,638 --> 00:04:25,680
Your girlfriend?

47
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,521
- Woooow!
- Yeah!

48
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:28,634
She's not!

49
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:31,099
Keep quiet. Don't you know who she is?

50
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:33,931
Then, is it over with that blinky-eyed
girl who was here before?

51
00:04:33,931 --> 00:04:34,972
No, it's not!

52
00:04:34,972 --> 00:04:36,371
- Hmph!
- Uh huh...

53
00:04:36,371 --> 00:04:40,562
You sure have a unique taste. Huh?

54
00:04:40,562 --> 00:04:44,511
- Hey, hey, hey! Her face isn't bad!
- Yeah!

55
00:04:44,511 --> 00:04:46,645
- Yeah!
- Wooooooo!

56
00:04:46,645 --> 00:04:49,035
Hey! You're into older types?

57
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:55,126
Wait a minute. She looks very familiar...

58
00:04:55,126 --> 00:04:58,612
Do you... live around here by chance?

59
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:01,444
No, I do not.

60
00:05:01,444 --> 00:05:03,332
Uh... That's strange...

61
00:05:03,332 --> 00:05:05,661
She's familiar, but where have I seen her?

62
00:05:05,661 --> 00:05:09,631
Wait! Did you have a nose job?

63
00:05:09,631 --> 00:05:10,990
- She did!
- She did!

64
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,182
- Hey! Hey!
- What?

65
00:05:12,182 --> 00:05:14,183
Ah. You sneak!

66
00:05:14,183 --> 00:05:16,054
- You are so sharp!
- Sharp! Yeah!

67
00:05:17,001 --> 00:05:18,050
Really!

68
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,861
Hey! How about taking your hat off?

69
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:22,676
Ah, why are you hiding your pretty face?

70
00:05:22,676 --> 00:05:25,446
You're making my heart
dance. It's okay! It's okay!

71
00:05:25,446 --> 00:05:28,258
- Yikes! Yikes! Wait...
- What's with this?

72
00:05:28,258 --> 00:05:30,477
Okay! Ahhh! Please let me go!

73
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:31,883
Let him go.

74
00:05:33,213 --> 00:05:34,324
Yes, Your Majesty.

75
00:05:34,324 --> 00:05:35,540
What? Your Majesty?

76
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,560
Darn! You runts!

77
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,471
Boss!

78
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,915
How dare you cause all this commotion?

79
00:05:40,915 --> 00:05:43,796
Immediately bow down and pay your
respects to Her Majesty the Empress!

80
00:05:43,796 --> 00:05:45,988
E-E-Empress?

81
00:05:45,988 --> 00:05:48,310
K-Kang Hoo...

82
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,388
It's... it's... it's a joke? Huh?

83
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,876
This is Her Majesty the Empress.

84
00:05:53,393 --> 00:05:55,562
I told you before.

85
00:05:55,562 --> 00:05:57,344
She is my second cousin....

86
00:05:59,602 --> 00:06:02,462
Your Majesty!

87
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,322
Please get the cameras ready.

88
00:06:13,322 --> 00:06:14,599
Yes.

89
00:06:40,385 --> 00:06:42,758
I... Your Majesty.

90
00:06:45,641 --> 00:06:48,734
Really... did you come all this way for me?

91
00:06:53,715 --> 00:06:57,261
Do you think I'm here to eat noodles?

92
00:06:58,282 --> 00:06:59,842
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:59,842 --> 00:07:04,906
I really was going to return right
away... I had some problems...

94
00:07:04,906 --> 00:07:06,318
I'm really sorry.

95
00:07:07,036 --> 00:07:08,947
Prince.

96
00:07:08,947 --> 00:07:14,875
One person's error can place
the entire human race in agony.

97
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:19,734
One person's sacrifice can fill
the entire human race with love.

98
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:25,226
The reason why I personally came here

99
00:07:25,226 --> 00:07:28,078
is to give you an opportunity.

100
00:07:28,078 --> 00:07:29,154
An opportunity?

101
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,092
Leaving the palace... an
opportunity for you to return here.

102
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:45,318
To live in the palace, your past
relations must be put aside,

103
00:07:45,318 --> 00:07:49,299
and new relations that the palace
accepts must be formed.

104
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:53,374
You must throw away all things familiar

105
00:07:53,374 --> 00:07:57,099
and willingly accept things
that are unfamiliar.

106
00:07:59,008 --> 00:08:02,141
Do you understand what I'm saying?

107
00:08:02,141 --> 00:08:03,448
A little bit.

108
00:08:05,678 --> 00:08:10,540
Then, are you ready for us to go back
to where new things are waiting?

109
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,560
Yes, ma'am.

110
00:08:13,764 --> 00:08:17,939
- Ahhhh!
- Ahhhh!

111
00:08:18,068 --> 00:08:19,938
What are you doing?

112
00:08:19,938 --> 00:08:24,130
Um... Well... It's not that... So I...

113
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,070
Ah! Hey, you say it.

114
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,229
Your Majesty!

115
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:35,317
If you can sign here...

116
00:08:35,317 --> 00:08:38,823
I will consider it the
greatest family honor...

117
00:08:38,823 --> 00:08:39,887
Gen... gen...

118
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:40,929
For all generations! For all generations!

119
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:43,040
For all generations! For...

120
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,304
Generation after generation. Dude!

121
00:08:44,304 --> 00:08:50,315
Generation after generation,
I will consider it a family treasure.

122
00:08:50,315 --> 00:08:52,739
We will treasure it.

123
00:08:52,739 --> 00:08:54,296
What are you doing?

124
00:08:54,955 --> 00:08:59,052
Your Majesty! Please honor us!

125
00:08:59,052 --> 00:09:01,541
Please honor us!

126
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,370
Are you guys in a historical drama?

127
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,673
Your Majesty, please forgive us!

128
00:09:06,673 --> 00:09:08,637
Your Majesty... Please forgive us!

129
00:09:08,637 --> 00:09:10,403
Die! Die! Die!

130
00:09:10,403 --> 00:09:13,262
- Ah!
- Ow!

131
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:14,905
Your Majesty. Your autograph?

132
00:09:37,397 --> 00:09:40,112
When will your mother be returning?

133
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:44,197
She said she would return soon,
but I don't know exactly when.

134
00:09:44,197 --> 00:09:46,357
But, don't worry.

135
00:09:46,357 --> 00:09:50,533
My family and the servants are
well trained in my mother's system.

136
00:09:50,533 --> 00:09:52,547
Your mother's system?

137
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:59,411
She always stresses,
"Always behave as if I am here! Okay?"

138
00:10:00,887 --> 00:10:03,101
Then, that's a relief.

139
00:10:07,768 --> 00:10:09,528
Miss Saeryung.

140
00:10:09,528 --> 00:10:11,060
Yes, ma'am.

141
00:10:12,247 --> 00:10:17,183
Are you aware this engagement
is being planned in secret

142
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,786
because of possible attacks
about it being political collusion?

143
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:26,000
I will not disappoint you.

144
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,832
As long as it is certain that Prince
Moonsung becomes the Crown Prince,

145
00:10:29,832 --> 00:10:31,916
my mind is also made up.

146
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:38,332
Excessive greed
will invite misfortune.

147
00:10:38,849 --> 00:10:41,844
I will bear that in mind, Mother.

148
00:11:05,651 --> 00:11:08,423
Has the Justice Committee convened?

149
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:13,375
They will decide tomorrow.

150
00:11:14,244 --> 00:11:18,131
Yikes! So what if you two were schoolmates?

151
00:11:18,131 --> 00:11:21,433
Instead of benefitting you,
you're about to lose your life.

152
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:26,130
You... Didn't I tell you not to
speak of him in front of me?

153
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,468
Don't!

154
00:11:28,704 --> 00:11:31,675
My stomach turns just hearing about it.

155
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:39,712
Hey! But, you have to
write 500 pages, right?

156
00:11:39,712 --> 00:11:41,435
When will you finish?

157
00:11:45,436 --> 00:11:46,911
Oh yeah...

158
00:12:01,363 --> 00:12:04,360
Well done. You may leave now.

159
00:12:05,546 --> 00:12:06,607
Yes, ma'am.

160
00:12:09,504 --> 00:12:12,844
My lord, I shall be on my way.

161
00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:26,849
Due to an immature wild rabbit,
the female lion is on the move...

162
00:12:26,849 --> 00:12:30,584
This time she traveled
outside of the palace?

163
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,845
I can still remember it.

164
00:12:33,845 --> 00:12:35,520
Because of Grand Duchess Kang,

165
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,056
the Imperial Court as a whole
had to endure severe criticism.

166
00:12:40,056 --> 00:12:43,780
Like mother like son, isn't it?

167
00:12:47,248 --> 00:12:51,511
Ah, I can finally relax.

168
00:12:51,511 --> 00:12:56,848
It crossed my mind that you might
may have been harmed by

169
00:12:56,848 --> 00:12:59,896
those who tried to kidnap you last time.

170
00:12:59,896 --> 00:13:02,952
I am sorry for causing you so much worry.

171
00:13:02,952 --> 00:13:05,608
This can never happen again.

172
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:08,112
Can you promise me?

173
00:13:08,112 --> 00:13:09,148
Yes.

174
00:13:11,489 --> 00:13:14,556
Your Majesty, I would
like to ask you something.

175
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:19,359
There was a court lady who
helped me leave the palace...

176
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:21,809
I was wondering what happened to her.

177
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:26,367
Grand Chamberlain, what
happened to that attendant?

178
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:31,446
Yes, Your Majesty, a decision
will be made by tomorrow.

179
00:13:31,446 --> 00:13:34,613
What? A decision?

180
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,853
Then, has she been...

181
00:13:36,853 --> 00:13:38,501
She isn't being fired, is she?

182
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:44,550
Your Highness, that attendant will find
it difficult to stay in the palace.

183
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,118
What?

184
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:48,709
She didn't do anything wrong!

185
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:52,749
I lied and told her my life depended on it.

186
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:56,325
Your Majesty, please let it go
just this once. Please?

187
00:13:56,325 --> 00:13:59,997
Prince, court ladies belong
to the Internal Affairs Division.

188
00:13:59,997 --> 00:14:04,262
In these matters, even the
Empress cannot interfere.

189
00:14:04,262 --> 00:14:06,865
I have no authority in this affair.

190
00:14:12,123 --> 00:14:16,308
Ah! Then, now what...

191
00:14:16,308 --> 00:14:17,880
What should I do?

192
00:14:30,628 --> 00:14:32,048
What is this?

193
00:14:33,028 --> 00:14:35,628
It's Her Majesty's command
to have Your Highness

194
00:14:35,628 --> 00:14:37,499
use the Imperial Court cellular phone.

195
00:14:37,499 --> 00:14:38,883
Huh?

196
00:14:38,883 --> 00:14:43,266
The number is one Her Highness once used.

197
00:14:43,266 --> 00:14:45,725
Really? Wow!

198
00:14:45,725 --> 00:14:48,310
Your Highness should retire now.

199
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:51,167
- I will humbly take my leave.
- I will!

200
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:57,238
Bingo!

201
00:15:03,707 --> 00:15:05,343
Why isn't she answering her phone?

202
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:12,769
[Prince Hours]

203
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:16,043
Due to an appearance of a royal
descendant not known until now,

204
00:15:16,043 --> 00:15:18,867
there has been an increased
interest in the Royal Family.

205
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:21,390
The Grand Prince Hyoin became
a controversial figure due

206
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,355
to his marriage to a commoner 18 years ago.

207
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,864
He passed away due to laryngeal cancer,

208
00:15:25,864 --> 00:15:28,872
but his son with the Grand Duchess Kang
has just recently been discovered.

209
00:15:28,872 --> 00:15:32,777
We have a palace reporter who's
standing by with more details.

210
00:15:32,777 --> 00:15:34,969
It has been confirmed that Prince Yi Hoo

211
00:15:34,969 --> 00:15:37,721
will have an effect on the
Imperial-throne succession.

212
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:39,314
However, instead of a happy atmosphere

213
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:40,932
with the appearance of
a new royal descendant,

214
00:15:40,932 --> 00:15:43,444
there is an unexpected dark
cloud over the palace.

215
00:15:43,444 --> 00:15:44,545
And the reason is,

216
00:15:44,545 --> 00:15:47,272
Prince Yi Hoo, who was residing
in the guest house, left the palace

217
00:15:47,272 --> 00:15:50,361
without permission. And, to find the Prince,

218
00:15:50,361 --> 00:15:55,511
Her Majesty the Empress personally
ventured outside in disguise.

219
00:15:55,511 --> 00:15:59,393
Due to this disturbance, the wave of
commotion has risen higher and higher.

220
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:02,054
Also, a section of the Imperial Court

221
00:16:02,054 --> 00:16:05,679
is questioning the Prince's
qualifications causing fierce debate.

222
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:08,249
Prince Yi Hoo was working as a
delivery person at a Chinese restaurant,

223
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:12,887
in Incheon's Chinatown before it was
discovered he was a royal descendant.

224
00:16:12,887 --> 00:16:15,892
He raised the Prince?

225
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:20,089
Now, really! What an odd fate.

226
00:16:21,477 --> 00:16:25,817
Do you know anything about his
whereabouts after he left our household?

227
00:16:28,036 --> 00:16:33,153
I am not sure, uh.... I have no idea.

228
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,097
If he is formally confirmed
as the royal descendant,

229
00:16:43,097 --> 00:16:51,712
Prince Yi Hoo will be first in line to
the throne over Prince Moonsung.

230
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:55,092
Currently, the Crown Prince position remains
vacant and if only lineage is considered...

231
00:16:55,092 --> 00:16:59,496
Your Highness, it is now time
to return to the palace.

232
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:06,764
He looks better on screen than I expected.

233
00:17:06,764 --> 00:17:10,324
Can we trust Prince Yi Hoo
who is giving rise to a debate about

234
00:17:10,324 --> 00:17:14,876
his disposition as the Crown Prince
only because he is a royal descendant?

235
00:17:14,876 --> 00:17:17,251
The citizens are greatly concerned.

236
00:17:17,251 --> 00:17:21,243
Prince Yi Hoo has not
received royal education,

237
00:17:21,243 --> 00:17:23,203
and has lived as a commoner for 20 years.

238
00:17:23,203 --> 00:17:29,054
His being educated now to attain the
needed qualifications will have its limits.

239
00:17:29,524 --> 00:17:34,032
Public opinion is strong even
before the battle has begun.

240
00:17:59,691 --> 00:18:03,198
You know I don't believe in fate or whatever?

241
00:18:03,198 --> 00:18:07,997
I won't just sit and wait...

242
00:18:14,184 --> 00:18:16,048
To search for Prince Yi Hoo,
Empress Hwain...

243
00:18:16,048 --> 00:18:17,662
Huh? What's that?

244
00:18:17,662 --> 00:18:19,768
What's wrong with my face?

245
00:18:19,768 --> 00:18:24,199
Ah! Darn! My perfect face looks
like a dish of blown-up noodles!

246
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:26,383
Ah! So embarrassing...

247
00:18:26,383 --> 00:18:29,643
Shoot! Why didn't they use a better picture?

248
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:31,438
Is the reporter prejudiced?

249
00:18:31,438 --> 00:18:33,086
Due to the sudden appearance of the Prince,

250
00:18:33,086 --> 00:18:36,326
there has been an increased interest
in the life of his mother,

251
00:18:36,326 --> 00:18:38,869
Grand Duchess Kang.

252
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:42,326
Also being discussed among the people
is the foundation's money scandal

253
00:18:42,326 --> 00:18:44,414
in which Grand Duchess Kang was implicated.

254
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:48,198
Because of this, Grand Duchess Kang
voluntarily left the Imperial Court

255
00:18:48,198 --> 00:18:51,397
less than a year of entering,
but why did she hide her son...

256
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:52,396
Mom...

257
00:18:52,396 --> 00:18:53,442
Yi Hoo's existence?

258
00:18:53,442 --> 00:18:56,351
Oh my! Really!

259
00:18:56,351 --> 00:18:59,535
Just when there's debate
about the Prince's formal entry,

260
00:18:59,535 --> 00:19:02,462
how could they do a story like that?

261
00:19:02,462 --> 00:19:05,373
I hardly know what to say, Your Highness.

262
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:11,706
Uncle! Would it be better
to confront it directly?

263
00:19:11,706 --> 00:19:14,664
An attack sometimes can be the best defense.

264
00:19:14,664 --> 00:19:19,145
Your Majesty, public opinion
is like a passing wind.

265
00:19:19,145 --> 00:19:21,936
Rather, we should concentrate
on the aftermath

266
00:19:21,936 --> 00:19:25,082
once the Prince is entered
onto the family register.

267
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,199
And that aftermath is?

268
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:32,276
The public is most concerned about
his suitability as Crown Prince,

269
00:19:32,276 --> 00:19:34,435
whether he has the qualifications.

270
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:42,211
It is more urgent that the Prince attain
the suitability and qualifications.

271
00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:44,515
Even if everything goes our way,

272
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:47,478
if he does not attain the
qualifications to be Crown Prince,

273
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:50,194
it will all be in vain.

274
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:53,622
Grand Chamberlain.

275
00:19:53,622 --> 00:19:54,710
Yes, Your Majesty.

276
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,784
Please find someone
who can instruct the Prince.

277
00:19:57,784 --> 00:20:01,440
The Royal Academy is not enough.

278
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,752
Find someone appropriate from the dissolved

279
00:20:03,752 --> 00:20:06,257
group of Crown Prince professors.

280
00:20:06,257 --> 00:20:07,730
Yes, Your Majesty.

281
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:11,750
Your Majesty, Prince Yi Hoo
requests to see you.

282
00:20:13,939 --> 00:20:15,238
Have him come in.

283
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:31,930
I have something to ask.

284
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,550
Sit down first. Let's sit and talk.

285
00:20:41,354 --> 00:20:43,630
It's regarding my mother.

286
00:20:45,097 --> 00:20:48,824
Why did my mother leave the palace?

287
00:20:50,596 --> 00:20:55,244
On TV, it said that she gave
rise to a public grievance.

288
00:20:55,244 --> 00:20:57,872
It didn't say for what reason.

289
00:20:58,732 --> 00:21:04,576
As far as I know, my mother would
never have taken money from others...

290
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:14,732
Hoo, you must believe this one thing.

291
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:17,780
It is true that there was a scandal.

292
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,803
However, it was not your mother's fault.

293
00:21:20,803 --> 00:21:24,270
Simply, there was a need for
someone to take the responsibility,

294
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:27,537
and that person was your mother.

295
00:21:28,277 --> 00:21:31,713
I will tell you more in detail later on.

296
00:21:32,757 --> 00:21:37,091
Your Majesty, Grand Prince Hyojang
requests to see you.

297
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,594
Hello.

298
00:21:50,535 --> 00:21:53,603
Oh! Oh, hi.

299
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:57,200
Your face looks even better on television.

300
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,915
Well, a man's got to look good.

301
00:22:00,915 --> 00:22:02,197
Then...

302
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:20,270
Your Grace, what brings you
here so unexpectedly?

303
00:22:20,897 --> 00:22:24,225
I have something I must tell Her Majesty.

304
00:22:24,225 --> 00:22:27,237
Please let her know I would
to speak with her alone.

305
00:22:38,161 --> 00:22:42,649
Due to the unexpected TV news broadcast
and unrest around the palace,

306
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:47,148
I was concerned about Your Majesty.

307
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:53,625
Your thoughts and concerns
surround me like veil of air,

308
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:55,693
so why should I be afraid?

309
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:10,019
I don't know who, what motive
or route they took to broadcast it,

310
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:13,801
but I don't think it is all negative.

311
00:23:13,801 --> 00:23:16,513
I am certain it was a concern for the future

312
00:23:16,513 --> 00:23:19,432
of the Royal Family and the country.

313
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:21,813
What do you think?

314
00:23:24,257 --> 00:23:28,120
How can a humble person
like me know the motive?

315
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:34,736
However, to overcome this perilous situation
the Imperial Court is confronting,

316
00:23:34,736 --> 00:23:38,469
I would like to petition
Your Majesty for one thing.

317
00:23:57,817 --> 00:24:00,666
Yang Sooneui, what will you do?

318
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:05,405
The senior attendants say there is no hope.

319
00:24:05,405 --> 00:24:08,383
Hey, shouldn't you at least
question the Prince at least?

320
00:24:08,383 --> 00:24:09,185
Oh my!

321
00:24:09,185 --> 00:24:11,989
You just said "Yang Sooneui," right?

322
00:24:23,673 --> 00:24:25,891
Your Highness!

323
00:24:25,891 --> 00:24:28,972
Yes, Prince. What is it?

324
00:24:28,972 --> 00:24:30,755
Is there something...

325
00:24:30,755 --> 00:24:32,735
Ah... I...

326
00:24:33,523 --> 00:24:34,814
Sit down.

327
00:24:38,212 --> 00:24:41,844
I understand you're the boss lady
in the Internal Affairs Division?

328
00:24:41,844 --> 00:24:43,667
Boss lady?

329
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:45,395
No. Whatever could you mean?

330
00:24:45,395 --> 00:24:46,907
Um, boss lady?

331
00:24:46,907 --> 00:24:49,458
Um, big cheese?

332
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:51,253
The very highest...

333
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:55,113
So, what do you want to tell me?

334
00:24:55,113 --> 00:24:58,298
Your Highness, please help
me this once. Please?

335
00:24:58,298 --> 00:25:00,857
How do you want me to help you?

336
00:25:00,857 --> 00:25:06,049
The attendant who helped me... I said I would
be responsible if anything went wrong.

337
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:10,001
But now that's it's like this, I feel as
though I must take responsibility.

338
00:25:10,001 --> 00:25:11,667
Oh my goodness!

339
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:14,285
Prince!

340
00:25:15,082 --> 00:25:19,205
Are you telling me you did something
that you need to be responsible for?

341
00:25:20,514 --> 00:25:22,376
No, how could you?

342
00:25:22,376 --> 00:25:25,541
Oh my... What shall we do? Oh my...

343
00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:29,365
Wait... what are you thinking?

344
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:36,640
Then, if you are responsible,
is it perhaps... a scandal?

345
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,851
An untold scandal?

346
00:25:39,851 --> 00:25:42,195
No! It's not that!

347
00:25:42,195 --> 00:25:44,586
That's a title of a movie. Really!

348
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:47,108
Then, what are you responsible for?

349
00:25:47,108 --> 00:25:50,548
Just stop her from being fired. Please?

350
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:52,898
It's completely all my fault.

351
00:25:52,898 --> 00:25:56,235
I would be embarrassed if she gets fired.

352
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:03,140
Promising something you can't keep
is not an act of brave man.

353
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,241
What can we do?

354
00:26:07,885 --> 00:26:10,183
We can't have the Prince
be a small-minded man

355
00:26:10,183 --> 00:26:12,912
who can't keep a promise...

356
00:26:12,912 --> 00:26:16,167
Yes. Originally, I am all about style.

357
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:18,190
I don't know what to do...

358
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:20,556
A man's got to have style. Sheesh.

359
00:26:21,949 --> 00:26:23,631
Do you understand now?

360
00:26:23,631 --> 00:26:27,476
How rash behavior can
bring on misfortune to others!

361
00:26:28,646 --> 00:26:29,762
Yes...

362
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:33,110
I heard you.

363
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:37,191
I will ask the head court lady to
handle the matter without a mishap,

364
00:26:37,191 --> 00:26:41,094
so you can now forget about that attendant.

365
00:26:41,094 --> 00:26:44,633
Then, Yang Sooneui won't be fired?

366
00:26:44,633 --> 00:26:46,356
Your grace is most infinite!

367
00:26:47,095 --> 00:26:50,353
Prince! That phrase is only
reserved for the Emperor...

368
00:26:50,353 --> 00:26:52,098
- Thank you!
- Well...

369
00:26:52,098 --> 00:26:54,054
I will treat you to a delicious meal later!

370
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:17,746
Don't! I don't feel like joking.

371
00:27:21,476 --> 00:27:23,924
Who is it? Uh?

372
00:27:23,924 --> 00:27:26,380
Hey, how could a maiden
grope at a man's hands?

373
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,952
And without fear at that.

374
00:27:30,323 --> 00:27:31,931
Why are you here?

375
00:27:31,931 --> 00:27:34,288
Hey! I called, but you never answered once!

376
00:27:34,288 --> 00:27:35,320
Were you busy?

377
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,744
Thanks to you, I was extremely busy!

378
00:27:37,744 --> 00:27:39,937
Well... you don't seem very busy.

379
00:27:39,937 --> 00:27:41,519
You jerk!

380
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,192
I vowed that if I ever saw you again,
I would change my last name!

381
00:27:45,192 --> 00:27:47,488
Ah...You make a vow on
such a trivial matter?

382
00:27:47,488 --> 00:27:49,418
You know I would take care of it entirely!

383
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,714
- Get out!
- Hey, why are you being so combative?

384
00:27:57,714 --> 00:27:59,455
- Why aren't you going?
- Hey!

385
00:27:59,455 --> 00:28:01,263
Hey, I told you I would take care of it!

386
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:03,439
You. You keep quiet!

387
00:28:03,439 --> 00:28:05,344
Hey...What's wrong, really?

388
00:28:05,344 --> 00:28:08,295
If you speak once more,
I will stitch up your mouth!

389
00:28:08,295 --> 00:28:09,994
Hey! Yang Sooneui! Attendant Yang!

390
00:28:09,994 --> 00:28:13,096
Get out! You won't go! Out!

391
00:28:13,096 --> 00:28:15,812
Don't ever appear before me again! Got it?

392
00:28:15,812 --> 00:28:17,120
You foolish foe!

393
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,616
Just listen to me!

394
00:28:18,616 --> 00:28:21,112
Yang Sooneui! Attendant Yang!!!

395
00:28:21,112 --> 00:28:22,168
Hey!

396
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:24,801
- La-la la-la-la la, la la la la la!
- Yang Sooneui!

397
00:28:24,801 --> 00:28:27,496
- Ah... Can't you hear me! Ah, Yang Sooneui!
- Lala lalala la, la la la la la!

398
00:28:27,496 --> 00:28:30,225
Hurry and open up! Ah, really!

399
00:28:30,225 --> 00:28:31,843
Huh? Come on!

400
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:34,349
What is this commotion
in this serene palace?

401
00:28:36,345 --> 00:28:40,079
It's a personal matter, so why
don't you just be on your way.

402
00:28:41,066 --> 00:28:43,570
Hey! I said I took care of everything!

403
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:45,540
Did you catch today's news?

404
00:28:46,098 --> 00:28:48,018
This is more important than the news.

405
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:50,491
Let's stay out of each other's business.

406
00:28:50,491 --> 00:28:52,229
Hey! Hey!

407
00:28:53,585 --> 00:28:56,563
I wanted to compete with
someone worthier,

408
00:28:56,563 --> 00:28:58,103
but it's merely this.

409
00:29:00,347 --> 00:29:02,813
Merely? Ha.

410
00:29:02,813 --> 00:29:05,843
You're really... Are you done now?

411
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:10,838
The person inside. Open the door!

412
00:29:10,838 --> 00:29:12,890
This is not a private space!

413
00:29:22,007 --> 00:29:23,107
Oh my god!

414
00:29:26,856 --> 00:29:28,275
Oh my god!

415
00:29:38,631 --> 00:29:40,886
Please state your opinions

416
00:29:40,886 --> 00:29:46,482
on the Prince's formal entry onto the
family register and official position.

417
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:07,268
Can we trust Grand Prince Hyojang?

418
00:30:07,268 --> 00:30:12,871
For now, there seems to be
no other way, Your Majesty.

419
00:30:12,871 --> 00:30:16,216
I humbly ask Your Majesty to consider

420
00:30:16,216 --> 00:30:21,090
delaying the Prince's schedule
for attending performances.

421
00:30:24,229 --> 00:30:27,327
It's a road we must cross at least once.

422
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:29,825
Please proceed as planned.

423
00:30:29,825 --> 00:30:32,261
Your wish is my command, Your Majesty.

424
00:30:40,118 --> 00:30:43,207
[Prince Hours]

425
00:30:50,009 --> 00:30:51,933
Is this enough?

426
00:30:54,513 --> 00:30:57,476
But... why do I have to deliver this?

427
00:31:01,081 --> 00:31:02,334
What is going on?

428
00:31:05,976 --> 00:31:10,271
This is Your Highness' formal attire for
your admission to the Royal Academy.

429
00:31:37,953 --> 00:31:41,302
What can I do? I have to get going now....

430
00:31:41,302 --> 00:31:45,267
Wait... I will try and wash it.

431
00:31:47,215 --> 00:31:48,506
Will you?

432
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,031
I am an important person.

433
00:31:55,031 --> 00:31:57,010
So aren't you being rather extreme?

434
00:31:58,054 --> 00:31:59,991
I apologize, Your Highness...

435
00:31:59,991 --> 00:32:02,294
It wasn't my intention.

436
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:06,506
I have caused you great grief.

437
00:32:06,506 --> 00:32:07,838
Then...

438
00:32:11,033 --> 00:32:12,890
Ah! Ow...

439
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:24,029
She becomes more interesting
the more I see her.

440
00:32:31,136 --> 00:32:34,396
But, it's a little tight.

441
00:32:35,561 --> 00:32:39,712
Ah, it seems okay...
Let me look at it once more.

442
00:32:39,712 --> 00:32:43,775
Ah, my butthole... It's a wedgie...

443
00:32:43,775 --> 00:32:44,823
Butt...

444
00:32:44,823 --> 00:32:49,899
Ah... my rear-end...
The pant seat is stuck...

445
00:32:51,975 --> 00:32:55,182
Your Highness' hip size
must be bigger than normal.

446
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:57,709
Ah! I don't have big hips!

447
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,846
I am standard-sized. Standard!

448
00:32:59,846 --> 00:33:03,749
It doesn't seem like it,
but I have a perfect bodyline...

449
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:05,344
The pants are too small!

450
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:10,175
Don't touch my sensitive area.

451
00:33:11,314 --> 00:33:14,347
But, can I wear my socks?

452
00:33:14,347 --> 00:33:16,754
I heard that royalty should
never be shown in bare feet?

453
00:33:16,754 --> 00:33:18,374
Yes, it's okay.

454
00:33:19,809 --> 00:33:21,393
I will use this machine to produce

455
00:33:21,393 --> 00:33:24,452
perfectly sized shoes for Your Highness.

456
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:28,367
Attendant Yang! Attendant Yang!

457
00:33:36,253 --> 00:33:37,687
Attendant Yang!

458
00:33:40,813 --> 00:33:43,696
Now what... now what?

459
00:33:48,733 --> 00:33:50,396
What's wrong?

460
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:54,405
If the Inspector Court Lady
sees me, I am dead.

461
00:33:54,405 --> 00:33:58,283
On top of that, Your Highness's attire...

462
00:33:58,283 --> 00:34:00,991
Your Highness! Please help me.

463
00:34:02,324 --> 00:34:08,143
I am sorry... please stay hidden for now.

464
00:34:11,107 --> 00:34:14,779
If I help you again, Attendant Yang,
what will you do for me?

465
00:34:14,779 --> 00:34:18,692
Your Highness. Please help me just once.

466
00:34:18,692 --> 00:34:21,721
If you help me this once, I will do anything.

467
00:34:23,117 --> 00:34:25,674
Here! This seems like a good place!

468
00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:29,342
Attendant Yang! Attendant Yang!

469
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:32,517
Attendant Yang!

470
00:34:33,442 --> 00:34:34,997
Attendant Yang!

471
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:38,382
Attendant Yang!

472
00:34:46,857 --> 00:34:49,223
Now where did she go?

473
00:34:55,506 --> 00:34:58,321
Is... is this real? Yes?

474
00:34:58,321 --> 00:35:00,054
This isn't a fake?

475
00:35:00,928 --> 00:35:04,555
Made in...

476
00:35:07,031 --> 00:35:09,747
Oww! My tummy!

477
00:35:10,982 --> 00:35:12,686
Ow, my tummy!

478
00:35:12,686 --> 00:35:17,343
It feels as though my
guts are getting knotty.

479
00:35:17,343 --> 00:35:21,685
I can't wait, so I'll be right
back. I'll hurry! Okay?

480
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,004
Attendant Yang!

481
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,258
Attendant Yang!

482
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:45,907
Attendant Yang!

483
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:07,736
What are you doing...

484
00:36:15,611 --> 00:36:19,217
- Ah! Ow...
- Ah! Ow...

485
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:22,003
- Ah!
- Owww...

486
00:36:22,794 --> 00:36:24,055
Are you okay?

487
00:36:52,753 --> 00:36:57,698
This is the formal response from Her Majesty.

488
00:36:57,698 --> 00:37:03,193
She has formally acknowledged

489
00:37:03,193 --> 00:37:08,554
that Prince Yi Hoo has left the
palace without permission.

490
00:37:10,246 --> 00:37:13,439
This is not a simple matter
of exiting the palace,

491
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:18,418
but damaging the Empress and the
authority of the Imperial Court!

492
00:37:19,007 --> 00:37:21,870
As an assembly member
representing the public,

493
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:23,965
I will say a word.

494
00:37:23,965 --> 00:37:27,675
The issue of the Prince's entry onto
the family register now seems unnecessary

495
00:37:27,675 --> 00:37:32,419
since it has been proven that the Prince,
as a royal, has denied his responsibilities.

496
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:34,122
- Yes!
- Yes!

497
00:37:34,122 --> 00:37:37,026
I would like add one more thing.

498
00:37:37,026 --> 00:37:41,730
How about looking at this from
the Prince's point of view?

499
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:48,098
He had no idea of his identity and lived
as a commoner for 20 years.

500
00:37:48,098 --> 00:37:53,751
Wouldn't that cause him much confusion
due to a sudden environment change?

501
00:37:54,778 --> 00:37:59,978
I would like to propose giving
an opportunity to the Prince.

502
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:03,795
I would like to give the Prince enough time

503
00:38:03,795 --> 00:38:06,351
to be familiar with living as a royal
and give him proper education.

504
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:09,279
After which, we can judge
whether he qualifies

505
00:38:09,279 --> 00:38:13,330
as a true descendant of the Royal Family
and it won't to too late to decide then.

506
00:38:16,526 --> 00:38:19,362
I also would like to add one more thing.

507
00:38:20,662 --> 00:38:24,246
It, indeed, was a scandalous matter...

508
00:38:24,246 --> 00:38:30,546
But, no one can deny that the
Prince is a royal descendant.

509
00:38:33,336 --> 00:38:37,511
If anyone does not recognize that fact,

510
00:38:37,511 --> 00:38:42,933
the Empress, I, and the entire
Imperial Court will not remain quiet.

511
00:38:42,933 --> 00:38:45,112
W-what is he saying?

512
00:38:46,022 --> 00:38:50,029
Our Imperial Court, for generation
after generation, had few descendants.

513
00:38:50,029 --> 00:38:53,645
Whenever the line of succession
was not clear or was divided,

514
00:38:53,645 --> 00:38:56,884
remember that it was
followed by great confusion

515
00:38:56,884 --> 00:38:58,785
to the point that it seemed to be a given.

516
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:07,053
As a Royal Council member,
and as the Prince's uncle,

517
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:19,939
I respectfully request... that you approve of
the Prince's entry onto the family register.

518
00:39:21,024 --> 00:39:22,590
That is all.

519
00:39:25,869 --> 00:39:27,267
Wait, is he?

520
00:39:59,661 --> 00:40:04,292
[Moak Hall]

521
00:40:22,358 --> 00:40:24,364
The "Crown Prince of Delivery"?

522
00:40:24,364 --> 00:40:26,318
Imperial Court, reconsider and apologize!

523
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:28,246
Prince Moonsung as the Crown Prince!

524
00:40:28,246 --> 00:40:30,262
No to the "Crown Prince of Delivery"!

525
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:32,385
Imperial Court, reconsider and apologize!

526
00:40:32,385 --> 00:40:34,116
Please look this way!

527
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:37,552
Imperial Court, reconsider and apologize!

528
00:40:37,552 --> 00:40:40,039
Would you excuse us? Yes!

529
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:42,053
No way to Crown Prince of Delivery.

530
00:40:42,053 --> 00:40:43,890
Imperial Court, reconsider and apologize!

531
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,810
Prince Moonsung as the Crown Prince!

532
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,762
No to the "Crown Prince of Delivery"!

533
00:40:47,762 --> 00:40:50,807
Imperial Court, reconsider and apologize!

534
00:40:50,807 --> 00:40:52,751
Prince Moonsung as the Crown Prince!

535
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:54,689
No to the "Crown Prince of Delivery"!

536
00:41:15,685 --> 00:41:17,381
Oh, how have you been?

537
00:41:17,381 --> 00:41:18,589
What are you doing?

538
00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:20,801
Black-bean noodles is best at The Palace!

539
00:41:20,801 --> 00:41:22,425
Wait, how do you know him?

540
00:41:22,425 --> 00:41:24,031
What?

541
00:41:24,031 --> 00:41:28,114
Well, he is the Incheon Harbor Labor leader.

542
00:41:28,114 --> 00:41:31,263
He was my customer when I used to deliver.

543
00:41:31,263 --> 00:41:33,784
You left the palace without
permission. Was there a reason?

544
00:41:33,784 --> 00:41:35,289
What? A reason?

545
00:41:35,289 --> 00:41:38,313
After the incident, public
opinion has been negative.

546
00:41:38,313 --> 00:41:40,086
How do you feel about that?

547
00:41:40,086 --> 00:41:42,743
Yes... I guess.

548
00:41:42,743 --> 00:41:46,711
That is... I am...

549
00:41:46,711 --> 00:41:48,743
I feel... happy about it.

550
00:41:48,743 --> 00:41:51,041
Wait, I don't understand why
you would say you are happy

551
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:53,535
when the opinions are so negative?

552
00:41:53,535 --> 00:41:55,734
It seems the only person who
understood the Prince's true meaning

553
00:41:55,734 --> 00:41:57,362
is me.

554
00:42:01,222 --> 00:42:07,333
The Prince is extremely happy
to have found his family,

555
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:12,496
and it's the same for myself
and the Imperial Court.

556
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:15,478
Also, the media, especially,
have been welcoming

557
00:42:15,478 --> 00:42:21,507
and I would like to extend
a special thank you.

558
00:42:22,502 --> 00:42:29,630
For all those who help with the prosperity
and safety of the Imperial Court,

559
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,379
I thank you.

560
00:42:32,765 --> 00:42:34,652
Your Majesty is too gracious.

561
00:42:36,704 --> 00:42:38,059
Your Majesty is too gracious.

562
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,383
Oh! Grand Prince Hyojang?

563
00:44:04,383 --> 00:44:07,167
- He couldn't have?
- Yes, Your Majesty!

564
00:44:07,167 --> 00:44:10,520
If it wasn't for his positive remarks,

565
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:14,608
the Prince's formal entry
would have been difficult.

566
00:44:14,608 --> 00:44:17,181
Oh! Is that so?

567
00:44:17,181 --> 00:44:20,860
That really is fortunate. Very fortunate.

568
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:24,021
Let's consider it as a gift from a serpent.

569
00:44:24,021 --> 00:44:27,191
It certainly was a gift I needed.

570
00:44:28,467 --> 00:44:33,122
I approved Prince Moonsoong's
accommodations within the palace, Mother.

571
00:44:33,122 --> 00:44:36,571
Wait, then does this mean that

572
00:44:36,571 --> 00:44:39,420
Your Majesty and Grand Prince
Hyojang made a deal?

573
00:44:40,082 --> 00:44:44,473
We each received what we needed.

574
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:48,963
From now on, everything depends
on Prince Youngsung.

575
00:44:50,055 --> 00:44:54,581
But... I don't see the Prince Youngsung?

576
00:44:54,581 --> 00:44:57,812
Ah... Yes, I do beg your pardon.

577
00:44:57,812 --> 00:45:02,132
He said he will be here as soon as he awakes.

578
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:03,716
Awakes?

579
00:45:03,716 --> 00:45:04,805
Oh my!

580
00:45:08,018 --> 00:45:12,125
No wonder. I can understand.

581
00:45:14,618 --> 00:45:16,447
Welcome.

582
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,599
It was a splendid performance.

583
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:21,316
It was a great honor for us

584
00:45:21,316 --> 00:45:23,836
to have you personally attend
our performance, Your Majesty.

585
00:45:23,836 --> 00:45:28,048
I should thank you for inviting me
to this outstanding event.

586
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:33,601
But, your son... Where is he?

587
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:37,360
Ah! There he is.

588
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:42,476
Oh! Jafljakateliba!

589
00:45:42,476 --> 00:45:44,264
Huh Jang Sang pays his respects.

590
00:45:47,987 --> 00:45:53,147
Ohhh... Your Majesty's blushing
cheeks are extremely becoming.

591
00:45:53,147 --> 00:45:57,896
It must be the excitement
from the first scene.

592
00:45:59,635 --> 00:46:04,619
Yes. The scene where the Nutcracker
transforms into a real prince

593
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:08,728
and dances with the princess
was truly inspiring.

594
00:46:08,728 --> 00:46:11,379
Amazing perception!

595
00:46:24,046 --> 00:46:25,984
What an odd feeling.

596
00:46:25,984 --> 00:46:29,702
I've never had 20-year-old men
try to pick me up before!

597
00:46:29,702 --> 00:46:33,562
Was there any mention about the budding
flower of the perfect female form?

598
00:46:35,981 --> 00:46:39,373
Prince Yi Hoo, what do
you think you are doing?

599
00:46:39,373 --> 00:46:43,293
How can you say something so discourteous
to this virtuous noblewoman...

600
00:46:43,293 --> 00:46:47,440
No, I just have friends whose
styles are extremely varied.

601
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,775
I worried there might be another victim.

602
00:46:50,775 --> 00:46:55,658
So, I nearly fell for an experienced player
and almost got entangled in his web?

603
00:46:57,079 --> 00:46:58,434
I would like to thank you.

604
00:47:02,063 --> 00:47:05,024
I would like to extend my gratitude
to you, two gentlemen,

605
00:47:05,024 --> 00:47:06,979
who gave me a moment of laughter.

606
00:47:09,862 --> 00:47:13,286
Please consider it a payment
of a previous debt?

607
00:47:13,286 --> 00:47:14,506
Then...

608
00:47:19,678 --> 00:47:24,454
I felt that he was someone with
unique presentation sensibilities.

609
00:47:24,454 --> 00:47:27,430
Excuse me, but after the performance,

610
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:30,166
if you will grant me the honor
of holding a conversation,

611
00:47:30,166 --> 00:47:32,590
I will consider it an immense honor.

612
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:36,202
Then... shall we meet at
the palace afterward?

613
00:47:38,326 --> 00:47:42,898
Empress! My chronic
migraine is coming on again.

614
00:47:44,156 --> 00:47:46,344
Are you very much distressed?

615
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:53,547
I don't know if I can
finish the performance...

616
00:47:53,547 --> 00:47:57,215
I would like to rest quietly for a minute.

617
00:47:58,915 --> 00:48:02,853
I apologize, but would you mind
giving us a moment alone?

618
00:48:02,853 --> 00:48:06,501
In that case, I hope you will
give me another opportunity.

619
00:48:06,501 --> 00:48:09,117
Ah! Please be sure to watch the 2nd Act.

620
00:48:09,117 --> 00:48:14,268
Your Majesty will surely feel the perfection
of Russian art from my performance.

621
00:48:14,268 --> 00:48:15,972
Of course.

622
00:48:15,972 --> 00:48:17,152
Then...

623
00:48:27,387 --> 00:48:28,287
Oh goodness me...

624
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:31,153
You... do not like him?

625
00:48:34,348 --> 00:48:38,556
No. I definitely saw his picture...

626
00:48:38,556 --> 00:48:41,937
But, what could he have eaten in
Russia to have turned out that way?

627
00:48:47,918 --> 00:48:49,716
Your Highness,

628
00:48:49,716 --> 00:48:53,581
this is the Constitutional Court
Justice Kim Moon Sik's wife...

629
00:48:53,581 --> 00:48:56,067
I am honored, Your Highness.

630
00:48:56,598 --> 00:48:59,085
This is Marquis Yi Sang Suk's daughter

631
00:48:59,085 --> 00:49:02,254
and Upper House Member Choi Chang Ho's wife.

632
00:49:02,254 --> 00:49:04,231
My congratulations, Your Highness.

633
00:49:04,231 --> 00:49:06,902
Yes, how do you do? It's nice to meet you.

634
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:09,613
I have just heard the news.

635
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:13,046
Congratulations on your formal admission.

636
00:49:13,046 --> 00:49:15,390
My true congratulations to you.

637
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:18,365
Thank you. I am busy, so I will...

638
00:49:18,365 --> 00:49:20,117
- Your Highness!
- Yes?

639
00:49:20,117 --> 00:49:23,260
If you will please allow it,

640
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:26,428
may my daughter and I visit Your Highness?

641
00:49:26,428 --> 00:49:29,133
My daughter also attends the Royal Academy.

642
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,862
- Ah... she does?
- Yes.

643
00:49:31,862 --> 00:49:33,131
Your Highness.

644
00:49:34,044 --> 00:49:35,408
Miss Saeryung.

645
00:49:42,122 --> 00:49:45,271
Your Highness, the director of
the Royal Academy requests

646
00:49:45,271 --> 00:49:47,192
your presence concerning your admission.

647
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,275
Me?

648
00:50:05,551 --> 00:50:08,041
I heard from the Grand Chamberlain
that you have shown great kindness

649
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:14,135
in Prince Youngsung's admission
into the Royal Academy.

650
00:50:14,135 --> 00:50:16,791
Do you foresee any problems
with the preparations?

651
00:50:16,791 --> 00:50:18,704
Please do not worry, Your Majesty.

652
00:50:18,704 --> 00:50:21,607
I will do my best.

653
00:50:21,607 --> 00:50:24,015
However, if you will allow it,

654
00:50:24,015 --> 00:50:26,539
I have someone I would like to
introduce to you, Your Majesty.

655
00:50:47,201 --> 00:50:51,784
Your Majesty, this is Professor
Alexander von Esterhazy.

656
00:50:51,784 --> 00:50:56,669
who will be providing instructions
on Anthropology.

657
00:50:58,034 --> 00:51:03,766
He is also a graduate of Oxford University.

658
00:51:05,235 --> 00:51:09,081
Yes, I see.

659
00:51:09,081 --> 00:51:12,450
It's an honor to meet you, Your Highness.

660
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:18,921
The Professor's mother is Korean,
but his father is Austrian nobility.

661
00:51:18,921 --> 00:51:23,121
This is his first visit to Korea
and his Korean is a bit rough.

662
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:24,414
I see...

663
00:51:35,293 --> 00:51:38,633
[Prince Hours]

664
00:51:38,633 --> 00:51:41,374
Whew! I made it through thanks to you.

665
00:51:41,374 --> 00:51:44,111
You are very observant!

666
00:51:44,111 --> 00:51:46,255
You seemed a little embarrassed.

667
00:51:46,255 --> 00:51:49,322
Ugh, those women were scary!

668
00:51:50,351 --> 00:51:52,839
With your formal admission,
you are first in line to the throne,

669
00:51:52,839 --> 00:51:54,904
Not only those noblewoman,

670
00:51:54,904 --> 00:51:57,463
but all the world will be
watching Your Highness.

671
00:52:08,893 --> 00:52:12,047
Huh? My necklace... where did it go?

672
00:52:12,894 --> 00:52:14,059
Huh? Here!

673
00:52:24,231 --> 00:52:26,886
Ah... it's a pretty necklace.

674
00:52:26,886 --> 00:52:28,098
Here...

675
00:52:30,575 --> 00:52:33,590
If it's not an imposition,
would you help me with it?

676
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:34,754
What?

677
00:52:35,774 --> 00:52:36,905
Yes.

678
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:56,697
Ah... this isn't easy.

679
00:53:05,773 --> 00:53:09,378
Your Highness, from today you will be
living a different life than yesterday?

680
00:53:10,247 --> 00:53:12,600
Yes...

681
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,935
The world is ready to welcome Your Highness.

682
00:53:15,935 --> 00:53:19,372
Is Your Highness ready to face the new world?

683
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:36,812
I had no idea that you would come
to an agreement with the Empress.

684
00:53:38,074 --> 00:53:41,584
You wanted our Joon in the palace
and we have tried for so long,

685
00:53:41,584 --> 00:53:44,007
but now it got resolved very easily.

686
00:53:44,007 --> 00:53:47,328
Your role will be important.

687
00:53:47,328 --> 00:53:53,807
Even with Joon in the palace,
my movements will be limited.

688
00:53:53,807 --> 00:53:55,901
People will be watching.

689
00:53:56,839 --> 00:54:02,431
However, from now on, it will be
a mother going to visit her son,

690
00:54:02,431 --> 00:54:07,531
so it will no longer be necessary to make
excuses or be mindful of watchful eyes.

691
00:54:07,531 --> 00:54:14,746
Visit as much you can and meet people.

692
00:54:14,746 --> 00:54:16,209
Do you understand?

693
00:54:16,209 --> 00:54:19,706
If it is necessary in placing
Joon on the throne,

694
00:54:19,706 --> 00:54:24,671
I won't hesitate to bulldoze
over an entire farm.

695
00:54:33,915 --> 00:54:35,554
Of course.

696
00:54:35,554 --> 00:54:39,721
I know I cannot interfere in
the workings of Internal Affairs.

697
00:54:39,721 --> 00:54:42,754
However, this is a fault of the royal,

698
00:54:42,754 --> 00:54:47,266
and having someone else take
the blame is an unfair situation.

699
00:54:47,266 --> 00:54:49,355
It does not look good.

700
00:54:50,711 --> 00:54:54,579
In the future, there should
be proper procedures.

701
00:54:55,606 --> 00:55:00,655
Thank you for taking an interest in an
Internal Affairs matter, Your Highness.

702
00:55:00,655 --> 00:55:03,190
Due to the Empress Dowager's
special concern of this matter,

703
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:06,838
the punishment was light.

704
00:55:06,838 --> 00:55:08,259
Empress Dowager?

705
00:55:10,942 --> 00:55:12,177
Yongnam!

706
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:19,397
Yongnam. I'm no longer
in disciplinary confinement.

707
00:55:19,397 --> 00:55:20,676
I'm to return to normal duties!

708
00:55:20,676 --> 00:55:23,375
Really? That's great!

709
00:55:29,835 --> 00:55:32,108
But hey...

710
00:55:32,108 --> 00:55:37,621
As soon as Prince Joon assisted us,
it all worked out in one go.

711
00:55:37,621 --> 00:55:40,053
Who? Who helped?

712
00:55:40,053 --> 00:55:43,267
Prince Moonsung! His Highness!

713
00:55:43,267 --> 00:55:44,510
Oh my! Really?

714
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:47,221
Yes. I heard he went to Court Lady Yoo

715
00:55:47,221 --> 00:55:50,663
and scolded her about the unfair punishment!

716
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:55,063
Wow! So much charisma!

717
00:56:26,595 --> 00:56:28,762
For the attendants who are promoted today,

718
00:56:28,762 --> 00:56:32,899
you should take the lead and set
an example on behalf of the Empress

719
00:56:32,899 --> 00:56:36,386
and the prosperity of the Imperial Household.

720
00:56:36,386 --> 00:56:37,718
Yes, ma'am.

721
00:56:46,475 --> 00:56:51,698
If I call your name, please come to
the front, receive the written order

722
00:56:51,698 --> 00:56:55,886
and verify your assigned station.

723
00:56:56,826 --> 00:56:58,823
Attendant Kim Minah!

724
00:56:58,823 --> 00:57:01,355
- Wow! Congratulations!
- You must be so happy!

725
00:57:01,355 --> 00:57:04,359
Really! Congratulations.

726
00:57:11,179 --> 00:57:15,215

post is Imperial Bookkeeping.

727

Attendant Kim Sooin!

728
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:25,853
- Wow! Wow!
- You must be happy!

729
00:57:25,853 --> 00:57:27,835
Congratulations.

730
00:57:28,592 --> 00:57:32,997
Attendant Kim Sooin's assigned
post is the Imperial Library.

731
00:57:35,567 --> 00:57:37,235
Attendant Na Sangsil!

732
00:57:39,353 --> 00:57:40,877
Wow!

733
00:57:46,682 --> 00:57:51,926
Attendant Na Sangsil's assigned
post is the Empress' inner court.

734
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:55,089
- Wow! Inner court!
- Ahhh! She must be happy!

735
00:57:57,703 --> 00:57:59,497
Attendant Min Dongim!

736
00:58:00,046 --> 00:58:02,349
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

737
00:58:02,349 --> 00:58:04,101
I probably won't make it?

738
00:58:04,101 --> 00:58:06,661
You said no promotion
because of that rare chicken?

739
00:58:06,661 --> 00:58:09,270
Don't worry. You have two benefactors.

740
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:11,393
Prince Youngsung and Prince Moonsung!

741
00:58:12,264 --> 00:58:14,371
Attendant Ma Yongnam!

742
00:58:14,371 --> 00:58:17,800
- I made it1
- Good job!

743
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,303
Yang Sooneui! I think I made it!

744
00:58:19,303 --> 00:58:21,376
Yongnam, I really congratulate you!

745
00:58:21,376 --> 00:58:22,805
Hurry and go!

746
00:58:28,577 --> 00:58:33,034
Attendant Ma Yongnam's assigned
post is Jipyoung Tower.

747
00:58:33,034 --> 00:58:34,557
Jipyoung Tower?

748
00:58:36,849 --> 00:58:38,710
Attendant Jung Sunhee!

749
00:58:49,073 --> 00:58:52,613
Attendant Jung Sunhee.
It's the Imperial Pavilion.

750
00:58:55,609 --> 00:58:59,379
This will complete the promotion
ceremony of the attendants.

751
00:58:59,379 --> 00:59:06,097
- No, how can this be?
- Hey, just cry....

752
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:13,048
Ah, wait!

753
00:59:16,959 --> 00:59:23,976
Empress Dowager has already
promoted Attendant Yang.

754
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,865
Attendant Yang Sooneui.

755
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:32,946
Yes?

756
00:59:32,946 --> 00:59:36,122
There has been an error in the paperwork.

757
00:59:36,122 --> 00:59:38,805
I congratulate you on your promotion.

758
00:59:39,641 --> 00:59:40,886
What?

759
00:59:44,253 --> 00:59:47,675
What? I made it?

760
01:00:45,917 --> 01:00:50,834
From now on, both of you
will be residing here.

761
01:00:52,197 --> 01:00:58,574
Before you two are royalty,
you are distant cousins first.

762
01:00:58,574 --> 01:01:01,870
By all means, try to learn
each other's merits

763
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:07,129
and cover each other's shortcomings
with brotherly love and friendship.

764
01:01:08,822 --> 01:01:11,021
Can I trust that you will do this?

765
01:01:11,021 --> 01:01:14,363
I will keep your wishes in mind
and follow your orders, Your Majesty.

766
01:01:16,149 --> 01:01:18,161
I am honored, Your Majesty.

767
01:01:21,446 --> 01:01:24,970
Your Majesty, it is now time to depart.

768
01:01:25,925 --> 01:01:30,105
I will visit the two Princes'
residences at a later time.

769
01:01:31,246 --> 01:01:32,838
Grand Chamberlain.

770
01:01:32,838 --> 01:01:36,870
Please see that they are not uncomfortable
and take good care of them.

771
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:38,913
I will bear that in mind, Your Majesty.

772
01:02:48,039 --> 01:02:49,338
[Prince Hours]

773
01:02:50,595 --> 01:02:54,456
Your Highness, do you want
me to help you unpack?

774
01:02:54,456 --> 01:02:56,336
Just be yourself when we're alone.

775
01:02:56,336 --> 01:02:57,720
I'll take care of you.

776
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,363
Yeah, right!

777
01:03:01,689 --> 01:03:03,967
You finally were allowed to live

778
01:03:03,967 --> 01:03:07,343
here because of your rival.

779
01:03:07,343 --> 01:03:10,190
You should thank Prince Youngsung.

780
01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:12,218
The battle has begun.

781
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:19,288
Prince Youngsung never learned how
to be dignified like a Crown Prince.

782
01:03:19,288 --> 01:03:21,330
Give him some time to learn.

783
01:03:25,085 --> 01:03:29,561
This is the first time Her Majesty

784
01:03:29,561 --> 01:03:31,235
has personally tried to make allies.

785
01:03:32,087 --> 01:03:35,197
That means she really wants

786
01:03:35,197 --> 01:03:37,386
Prince Yi Hoo to be the Crown Prince.

787
01:03:38,595 --> 01:03:40,671
Tell me what you're up to!

788
01:03:43,627 --> 01:03:44,851
That's him!

789
01:03:44,851 --> 01:03:46,916
He's the guy who tried to kidnap me!

790
01:03:46,916 --> 01:03:47,984
Stand by.
