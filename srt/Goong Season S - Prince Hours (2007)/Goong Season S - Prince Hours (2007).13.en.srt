00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:10,494
I'm sorry for the grief I caused
you because of the ring.

00:00:10,494 --> 00:00:12,723
Please don't worry.

3
00:00:12,723 --> 00:00:14,526
Everything will be okay.

4
00:00:14,526 --> 00:00:16,846
Thank you for your concern.

00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:59,089
Kang Hoo, listen to me carefully.

8
00:01:59,089 --> 00:02:02,431
I have my dreams and aspirations.

9
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:03,935
That's why I worked hard
to come into the palace.

10
00:02:03,935 --> 00:02:08,565
But, everything's messed up now.

11
00:02:08,565 --> 00:02:09,996
Why? Because of me?

12
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:12,733
Yes, because of you.

13
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,915
I don't know what I should do!

14
00:02:14,915 --> 00:02:17,097
I don't want to talk to you anymore!

[Prince Hours]

16
00:04:12,141 --> 00:04:14,308
Did you have to do that?

17
00:04:14,308 --> 00:04:17,848
I don't know what you're talking about.

18
00:04:17,848 --> 00:04:20,891
I'm talking about Attendant Yang.

19
00:04:20,932 --> 00:04:24,016
Did you tell her to leave
the palace in exchange for

20
00:04:24,016 --> 00:04:26,433
giving Prince Youngsung's ring back?

21
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,848
You're not going to stop, are you?

22
00:04:29,848 --> 00:04:35,848
You would never lose
an important ring like that.

23
00:04:35,848 --> 00:04:42,266
If you really did lose that ring, you
wouldn't have given it to Attendant Yang.

24
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:45,848
I can do anything for you.

Mother.

26
00:04:46,848 --> 00:04:50,099
You should know this.

The one who suggested leaving
your side in exchange

28
00:04:54,004 --> 00:04:58,099
for my giving the ring
back wasn't me, but her.

29
00:04:58,141 --> 00:05:01,516
She only cares about Prince Youngsung.

30
00:05:01,516 --> 00:05:03,848
She doesn't care for you.

31
00:05:03,848 --> 00:05:06,183
Do you get it now?

32
00:05:06,183 --> 00:05:10,099
This is actually better.

33
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:13,848
She didn't deserve you from the beginning.

34
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:18,848
Now that you know how she feels,
you should give her up.

35
00:05:18,848 --> 00:05:22,848
I can't.

36
00:05:22,848 --> 00:05:30,848
She's the first woman I've ever wanted.

37
00:05:30,848 --> 00:05:33,848
I can't give her up this easily.

38
00:05:37,848 --> 00:05:40,848
I have to go.

39
00:06:43,848 --> 00:06:46,848
Did you talk to Attendant Yang?

40
00:06:46,848 --> 00:06:49,848
No.

41
00:06:49,848 --> 00:06:56,099
Can you tell me how I got this ring back?

42
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:58,433
I'm sorry, but I can't.

43
00:06:58,433 --> 00:07:00,815
I only have one thing to tell you.

44
00:07:00,815 --> 00:07:05,296
Please don't pay attention to
Attendant Yang anymore.

45
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:06,308
Why's that?

46
00:07:06,308 --> 00:07:12,808
I thought you told me Attendant
Yang isn't even your friend,

47
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:16,848
but just an attendant.

48
00:07:22,974 --> 00:07:29,391
But, I need to know why I got that ring back.

49
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:38,848
Does the Grand Duchess know how
you feel toward Attendant Yang?

50
00:07:38,848 --> 00:07:46,099
This is just my guess, but if she does...

51
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:52,848
maybe she made a deal with this ring.

52
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:55,848
What were you doing?

53
00:07:55,848 --> 00:07:58,308
I thought you liked Yang Sooneui.

54
00:07:58,308 --> 00:08:00,932
Couldn't you stop her from leaving?

55
00:08:01,058 --> 00:08:05,183
Couldn't you convince your mother?

56
00:08:05,183 --> 00:08:08,016
I thought you liked Yang Sooneui.

57
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:12,848
I guess you didn't.

58
00:08:12,848 --> 00:08:16,932
Maybe this is all your fault.

59
00:08:16,932 --> 00:08:21,974
Attendant Yang always had
a hard time because of you.

60
00:08:21,974 --> 00:08:28,475
She gave her job up to get your ring back!

61
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:29,848
You can't be serious.

62
00:08:29,848 --> 00:08:37,848
She gave up on her dream for someone
who doesn't even think of her as a friend.

63
00:08:37,848 --> 00:08:41,058
That's what she did.

64
00:08:41,058 --> 00:08:43,141
I'm warning you.

65
00:08:43,141 --> 00:08:45,848
This is where it has to stop.

66
00:08:45,848 --> 00:08:48,848
You have chosen your path.

67
00:08:48,848 --> 00:08:53,848
Now, walk that path.

68
00:08:53,848 --> 00:08:58,848
Don't bother Attendant Yang anymore.

69
00:09:48,848 --> 00:09:52,848
Now that you're the Acting Prime Minister,
I'll be seeing you more often.

70
00:09:52,848 --> 00:09:55,350
Thank you, Your Majesty.

71
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:01,932
Your Majesty must've been distressed after
the Prime Minister suddenly collapsed.

72
00:10:01,932 --> 00:10:07,516
I will do my best to ensure Your Majesty's
safety and prosperity of the Imperial Court.

73
00:10:07,516 --> 00:10:12,848
I hope we can help each other
in many ways in the future.

74
00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:28,848
You shouldn't have done that, dear.

75
00:10:28,848 --> 00:10:33,308
You could've put that treasure to better use.

76
00:10:33,308 --> 00:10:41,848
I had no choice if I wanted
to make her leave Joon.

77
00:10:41,848 --> 00:10:47,558
Did you see the look on the
Deputy Prime Minister's face?

78
00:10:47,558 --> 00:10:50,058
Maybe he has decided to
side with Her Majesty.

79
00:10:50,058 --> 00:10:53,848
I need to teach him a lesson.

80
00:10:53,848 --> 00:11:01,391
I should let him know how dangerous
it is to side with the Empress.

81
00:11:01,391 --> 00:11:03,848
He's a smart man.

82
00:11:03,932 --> 00:11:08,350
He'll get the idea.

83
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:19,683
Did you request to be transferred here?

84
00:11:19,683 --> 00:11:21,848
Yes, I did.

85
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:27,848
Are you sure you didn't make
a mistake in the palace?

86
00:11:27,848 --> 00:11:29,848
No, it wasn't because of that.

87
00:13:00,266 --> 00:13:03,848
Attendant Yang.

88
00:13:03,848 --> 00:13:05,848
Yes?

89
00:13:12,848 --> 00:13:20,848
I was very pleased to hear that
you two are studying diligently.

90
00:13:20,848 --> 00:13:22,848
Thank you, Your Majesty.

91
00:13:22,848 --> 00:13:31,848
I called you here today to give
you your second assignment.

92
00:13:31,848 --> 00:13:37,141
Your second assignment
will be a martial arts match.

93
00:13:37,141 --> 00:13:39,724
As decided by the Royal
Kin and Royal Council,

94
00:13:39,724 --> 00:13:42,308
this assignment will be
divided into three parts.

95
00:13:42,308 --> 00:13:52,391
Archery, a double-sword fight on
horseback, and hand-to-hand combat.

96
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:53,848
Captain of the Royal Guard.

97
00:13:53,848 --> 00:13:56,058
Yes, Your Majesty.

98
00:13:56,058 --> 00:14:02,266
You will be the sole judge
of this competition.

99
00:14:02,266 --> 00:14:11,224
In order to make the competition fair,
don't help the Princes with training.

100
00:14:11,224 --> 00:14:13,266
Yes, Your Majesty.

101
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:20,848
Instead, let the two Princes
select and train with

102
00:14:20,848 --> 00:14:23,848
the instructor of their choice.

103
00:14:23,848 --> 00:14:25,266
Yes, Your Majesty.

104
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:29,848
Your evaluation will take
place in exactly a month.

105
00:14:29,848 --> 00:14:36,848
Until then, I'd like you two to
train and show improvement.

106
00:14:36,932 --> 00:14:41,767
Yes, Your Majesty.

107
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,725
No way!

108
00:14:54,725 --> 00:14:57,848
You only have little experience
with archery and martial arts.

109
00:14:57,848 --> 00:14:59,767
And you've never practiced a
double sword fight on horseback.

110
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:00,848
Do you think he can do it?

111
00:15:00,848 --> 00:15:02,308
It'll be hard.

112
00:15:02,308 --> 00:15:05,767
Who knows? Maybe there'll be a miracle.

113
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:09,308
But, then again, that's how
you won your first assignment.

114
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,848
But, this is different!

115
00:15:11,848 --> 00:15:13,848
You can't master martial arts in a day!

116
00:15:13,848 --> 00:15:17,516
Still, he can't give up already.

117
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:21,141
You know what? We'll help you.

118
00:15:21,141 --> 00:15:24,266
He can teach you how to hold a sword.

119
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:26,891
Yes, and he can be your practice
partner for the hand-to-hand combat.

120
00:15:26,891 --> 00:15:30,848
Let's do it!

121
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:33,848
I can only get help from one person.

122
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,848
Thanks for the offer though.

123
00:15:36,848 --> 00:15:42,141
Do you have anyone in mind?

124
00:15:46,848 --> 00:15:51,558
Your Highness, Mr. Cho is here.

125
00:15:58,848 --> 00:16:02,891
I left home as soon as I got your phone call.

126
00:16:02,891 --> 00:16:05,848
What's the matter?

127
00:16:05,848 --> 00:16:09,099
I need you to be my instructor.

128
00:16:09,099 --> 00:16:11,016
I really need your help.

129
00:16:11,016 --> 00:16:18,350
Now that I'm done with the Literature part,
my next assignment is martial arts.

130
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:22,183
Do you know which parts you'll be tested on?

131
00:16:22,183 --> 00:16:24,848
Yes.

132
00:16:24,848 --> 00:16:28,224
I only have a month left.

133
00:16:28,224 --> 00:16:31,264
Do you think I can do it?

134
00:16:31,412 --> 00:16:33,204
Ah ha...

135
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:36,848
We're short on time.

136
00:16:38,974 --> 00:16:44,308
We'll start with the double-sword
fight on horseback.

137
00:16:44,308 --> 00:16:48,932
Since you have to move left and right
to attack your enemies on both sides,

138
00:16:48,932 --> 00:16:53,433
you must be an expert in horseback
riding and sword fighting.

139
00:16:53,433 --> 00:16:56,848
We will start with the sword.

140
00:17:03,848 --> 00:17:06,848
But, this is a wooden sword.

141
00:17:06,848 --> 00:17:10,848
Even though we're short on time,
you have to take one step at a time.

142
00:17:10,848 --> 00:17:16,849
You should first get used
to the wooden sword.

143
00:17:29,016 --> 00:17:32,848
I think I'm used to it now. Can I
practice with a real sword now?

144
00:17:32,848 --> 00:17:38,099
No, it's not the time.
You need more practice.

145
00:18:04,848 --> 00:18:10,848
It's a little too early, but we will
now practice with a real sword.

146
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:22,475
Try cutting that straw post.

147
00:18:41,974 --> 00:18:47,391
It takes practice. Don't worry.

148
00:18:47,391 --> 00:18:52,099
You just need more training.

149
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:54,849
Okay, Mr. Cho.

150
00:19:15,848 --> 00:19:19,641
Hey, this is really good!

151
00:19:19,641 --> 00:19:24,848
I hope you like it, Mr. Cho. Please try it.

152
00:19:24,848 --> 00:19:27,848
Good, isn't it?

153
00:19:27,848 --> 00:19:30,099
Hey, what happened?

154
00:19:30,141 --> 00:19:32,848
Oh, a relative of mine runs this place.

155
00:19:32,848 --> 00:19:36,558
I guess you can say... I got scouted.

156
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:41,308
As you know, I'm the
best deliverer in Incheon.

157
00:19:41,308 --> 00:19:42,350
What?

158
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,350
You're distorting the truth.

159
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,350
Distorting the truth?

160
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:52,848
I don't understand hard words
like that, Your Highness.

161
00:19:52,848 --> 00:19:54,848
By the way, what are you doing here?

162
00:19:54,848 --> 00:19:57,058
Can you come outside whenever you want?

163
00:19:57,141 --> 00:19:59,849
I brought him here after I got your call.

164
00:19:59,849 --> 00:20:03,308
I thought he could use a break.

165
00:20:03,308 --> 00:20:05,099
A break?

166
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:09,600
Why? Does he need a break?

167
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,848
What's wrong?

168
00:20:10,848 --> 00:20:13,848
It's okay. Everything's fine.

169
00:20:13,848 --> 00:20:16,308
I don't think so.

170
00:20:16,308 --> 00:20:19,848
Anyway, eat this pizza and cheer up.

171
00:20:19,848 --> 00:20:20,891
I'll get you another one.

172
00:20:20,974 --> 00:20:26,848
We have the best pizza
in town. Just wait a sec.

173
00:20:26,848 --> 00:20:32,600
You're going to stay long enough
to say hi to everyone, right?

174
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,932
They all wanted to call you,
but I told them not to.

175
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:45,099
I guess not.

176
00:20:45,099 --> 00:20:47,848
Okay, I won't tell them that you stopped by.

177
00:20:47,848 --> 00:20:50,182
Since you can't eat pizza in the palace,

178
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:53,848
I'll box up 10 for you to take
home. Just wait a bit, okay?

179
00:21:04,005 --> 00:21:07,031
[Prince Hours]

180
00:21:11,848 --> 00:21:14,016
Your Majesty.

181
00:21:14,016 --> 00:21:21,058
The Prime Minister wants
to retire from office.

182
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:26,848
Then, I guess his health is
deteriorating even more.

183
00:21:26,848 --> 00:21:31,848
He should seek your approval in person,

184
00:21:31,848 --> 00:21:35,141
but he said the doctors wouldn't
let him leave the hospital.

185
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:41,849
He has requested your approval through me.

186
00:21:41,974 --> 00:21:44,848
What should we do?

187
00:21:44,848 --> 00:21:49,848
What happens if I accept his proposal?

188
00:21:49,848 --> 00:21:53,848
Will the Acting Prime Minister
become the official Prime Minister?

189
00:21:53,848 --> 00:21:55,848
Yes, Your Majesty.

190
00:21:55,848 --> 00:22:02,932
He will be the Prime Minister
for the remaining term.

191
00:22:02,932 --> 00:22:09,141
And, I will be without my right-hand
man for the remaining term.

192
00:22:09,141 --> 00:22:12,849
I don't have a choice.

193
00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:15,848
I will accept the Prime Minister's request

194
00:22:15,848 --> 00:22:22,848
and approve Shin Jaeman as Prime Minister.

195
00:22:22,848 --> 00:22:26,848
I will do as you say, Your Majesty.

196
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:51,848
He stayed around longer than I expected,

197
00:22:51,848 --> 00:22:54,848
but the Empress's right-hand
man is finally out.

198
00:22:54,848 --> 00:22:57,058
If everything had gone as planned,

199
00:22:57,058 --> 00:23:03,848
the Deputy Prime Minister was supposed
to be Joon's biggest support.

200
00:23:03,848 --> 00:23:08,848
We can't carry on with
the engagement anymore.

201
00:23:08,848 --> 00:23:11,391
What should we do now?

202
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:17,725
If he doesn't want to side with us,
then he must pay the price.

203
00:23:26,891 --> 00:23:32,848
Just because you ran your sword through
it doesn't mean you succeeded.

204
00:23:32,848 --> 00:23:40,725
You're supposed to cut this
evenly as if it's a single line.

205
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:46,848
What's my problem? I don't
know what I'm supposed to do.

206
00:23:46,848 --> 00:23:53,516
You already know what you're supposed to do.

207
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:56,891
Sometimes, figuring
something out on your own

208
00:23:56,891 --> 00:23:59,767
is more important than
learning it from someone.

209
00:23:59,767 --> 00:24:05,549
That time is now. Try
figuring it out on your own.

210
00:24:21,848 --> 00:24:26,848
A wise man does not curse the
ground even if he should fall on it.

211
00:24:26,848 --> 00:24:32,767
Because, in order to get up,
he needs the ground's support.

212
00:26:29,016 --> 00:26:32,848
Try figuring it out on your own.

213
00:27:11,183 --> 00:27:13,932
Very good, Your Highness.

214
00:27:13,974 --> 00:27:16,224
Did I succeed?

215
00:27:16,224 --> 00:27:21,266
Your Highness finally learned how to slice.

216
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:25,849
Until now, you've just been hitting.

217
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:33,230
You can't slice without the proper
strength, speed, and angle.

218
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,909
If you're missing even one
of those, you won't succeed.

219
00:27:36,974 --> 00:27:43,016
You weren't successful until now since
you've only focused on strength.

220
00:27:43,016 --> 00:27:46,308
This is only your first successful attempt.

221
00:27:46,308 --> 00:27:51,016
You must train continuously
to maintain your momentum.

222
00:27:51,058 --> 00:27:55,725
Remember, practice makes perfect.

223
00:27:55,725 --> 00:27:58,848
Okay, Mr. Cho.

224
00:28:34,848 --> 00:28:38,848
I never knew he'd learn that fast.

225
00:28:38,848 --> 00:28:40,183
Don't worry.

226
00:28:40,183 --> 00:28:44,848
You're still far better than he is.

227
00:29:41,848 --> 00:29:46,848
Are you sure you're not overworking yourself?

228
00:29:46,848 --> 00:29:48,141
I'm fine.

229
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:51,848
Thanks for your concern.

230
00:29:55,848 --> 00:29:57,848
Oh, really?

231
00:29:57,848 --> 00:29:59,848
Saeryung's parents are divorced?

232
00:29:59,848 --> 00:30:03,433
No, but they're separated.

233
00:30:03,433 --> 00:30:05,848
Same thing.

234
00:30:05,848 --> 00:30:07,725
I can't believe she's not here even

235
00:30:07,725 --> 00:30:09,848
after he husband became
the Acting Prime Minister.

236
00:30:09,848 --> 00:30:11,856
She doesn't care if she's
the First Lady or not.

237
00:30:11,856 --> 00:30:13,697
Wow, she's something else...

238
00:30:25,942 --> 00:30:27,390
Saeryung is no joke either...

239
00:30:32,848 --> 00:30:34,848
If you want to say something about someone,

240
00:30:34,848 --> 00:30:38,848
why don't you say it in front of that person?

241
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:43,224
If not, you should do a better job
of talking behind someone's back.

242
00:30:43,224 --> 00:30:48,848
Saeryung, we didn't mean to do that.

243
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:49,849
Let's go.

244
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:07,767
It's okay... That's just how
things work around here.

245
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:11,558
If you show a weakness,
people will attack you.

246
00:31:11,558 --> 00:31:16,183
I think I know how you feel.

247
00:31:16,183 --> 00:31:23,848
That's what I did whenever
people talked about my mother.

248
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:27,516
Don't mind what others say.

249
00:31:27,516 --> 00:31:31,016
It's your own thoughts that matter.

250
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:34,600
As long as you believe in
your own mother, it's fine.

251
00:31:37,848 --> 00:31:45,848
But different from what Your Highness just
said, what if they're speaking the truth?

252
00:31:45,848 --> 00:31:50,808
You can pretty much say that
my parents are divorced.

253
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:56,808
I sometimes don't even remember
what my mom looks like anymore.

254
00:32:00,725 --> 00:32:03,932
I'm boring you, aren't I?

255
00:32:10,266 --> 00:32:19,849
Remember how you held my hand when
we came back from my father's grave?

256
00:32:19,974 --> 00:32:25,848
That really comforted me... a lot.

257
00:33:02,117 --> 00:33:04,630
Your form is incorrect again.

258
00:33:05,898 --> 00:33:10,983
You do not change your form to the bow.
You must hold the bow to fit your form.

259
00:33:11,897 --> 00:33:17,798
But, no matter how I hold
the bow, it doesn't feel right.

260
00:33:17,798 --> 00:33:22,456
Could you bring Prince Hoo's
skateboard right now?

261
00:33:22,456 --> 00:33:27,504
Pardon? Bring the skateboard? Here?

262
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,930
Yes.

263
00:33:34,902 --> 00:33:36,589
You want me to ride this?

264
00:33:36,589 --> 00:33:38,053
Yes, Your Highness.

265
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:52,594
Please be careful!

266
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:00,841
How did you feel riding it?

267
00:34:01,132 --> 00:34:04,014
I've skateboarded for a
long time. It's no big deal.

268
00:34:04,014 --> 00:34:05,636
That’s the point!

269
00:34:06,825 --> 00:34:09,960
When you first tried skateboarding,
you weren't used to it at all.

270
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,730
But, as you kept riding it, you
were able to control it freely,

271
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:17,923
as if it was a part of your body.

272
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:24,209
The same goes for all weapons and tools.

273
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:27,946
Try to become one with the bow.

274
00:34:28,654 --> 00:34:31,140
Become one with the bow...

275
00:35:06,044 --> 00:35:14,584
If I can move this arrow like
my own hands and feet...

276
00:35:36,584 --> 00:35:37,835
Your Majesty.

277
00:35:50,002 --> 00:35:54,585
Here are your evening papers.

278
00:35:59,584 --> 00:36:03,584
[Acting Prime Minister Shin Jaeman
to Become Prime Minister]

279
00:36:03,584 --> 00:36:11,584
Grand Chamberlain, what will the
political climate be like in the future?

280
00:36:11,584 --> 00:36:21,794
The Pro-Imperialists will most likely
join with Prime Minister Shin.

281
00:36:21,794 --> 00:36:28,584
If that happens, Grand Prince
Hyojang's group will lose power.

282
00:36:28,584 --> 00:36:36,584
Maybe Prime Minister Shin will
oppress Grand Prince Hyojang...

283
00:36:36,584 --> 00:36:43,584
How are the two Princes doing with their
martial arts training? Is it going well?

284
00:36:43,584 --> 00:36:50,294
They're both training vigorously.

285
00:36:50,294 --> 00:36:57,044
What if we hold the competition
at a district palace, Grand Chamberlain?

286
00:36:57,127 --> 00:36:59,377
A district palace?

287
00:36:59,377 --> 00:37:02,584
Is there a particular reason to do so?

288
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:12,252
I think we should hold this
competition at a meaningful place.

289
00:37:12,252 --> 00:37:16,710
Then, Onyang Palace may be a good choice.

290
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:21,584
Onyang Palace?

291
00:37:21,584 --> 00:37:24,584
Onyang Palace is where
the scholars came up with

292
00:37:24,584 --> 00:37:29,584
the educational goals of the Royal Academy.

293
00:37:29,584 --> 00:37:34,584
The old drill hall is still there.

294
00:37:34,584 --> 00:37:40,584
I think it'll be the perfect
place for the competition.

295
00:37:40,584 --> 00:37:45,584
Your Majesty, Madam Chamberlain
has a good point, but...

296
00:37:45,584 --> 00:37:49,584
I'll leave the decision up to you two.

297
00:37:49,584 --> 00:37:52,503
Yes. Your Majesty.

298
00:37:53,606 --> 00:37:56,540
[Prince Hours]

299
00:38:17,127 --> 00:38:19,002
Who's coming?

300
00:38:19,002 --> 00:38:21,584
Most of the people from
the Imperial Court will be here!

301
00:38:21,584 --> 00:38:24,584
This is awesome.

302
00:38:24,584 --> 00:38:26,668
But... why?

303
00:38:26,794 --> 00:38:32,584
We're the only district
palace with a drill hall.

304
00:38:32,584 --> 00:38:35,584
This is the perfect place for a duel.

305
00:38:35,584 --> 00:38:37,835
When is it exactly?

306
00:38:37,835 --> 00:38:41,584
Next week.

307
00:38:41,584 --> 00:38:42,584
Where?

308
00:38:42,584 --> 00:38:44,877
Onyang Palace.

309
00:38:44,877 --> 00:38:49,336
Onyang Palace?

310
00:38:49,336 --> 00:38:52,127
That's right.

311
00:38:52,127 --> 00:38:57,584
That's where Attendant Yang
is working right now.

312
00:39:03,584 --> 00:39:09,377
Anyway, it's going to be at Onyang Palace.

313
00:39:09,377 --> 00:39:13,584
Allow me to excuse myself, Your Majesty.

314
00:39:47,627 --> 00:39:50,211
Do you know where the duel will be held?

315
00:39:50,211 --> 00:39:52,377
Yes.

316
00:39:52,377 --> 00:39:57,377
Good. I'm glad Miss Sooneui can see me win.

317
00:40:00,835 --> 00:40:02,584
Bye.

318
00:40:17,584 --> 00:40:20,584
Why did she change the
location all of a sudden?

319
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,584
She wants to hold the
duel at an old drill hall

320
00:40:23,584 --> 00:40:27,960
in order to rethink the educational goals.

321
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,584
She has a point.

322
00:40:31,584 --> 00:40:35,584
But, is that the only reason?
Isn't there another reason?

323
00:40:39,461 --> 00:40:43,584
I think something's going
on with the Empress.

324
00:40:43,584 --> 00:40:46,584
I need to find out what it is.

325
00:40:46,584 --> 00:40:51,584
Study the Empress carefully
while you're there.

326
00:40:51,584 --> 00:40:53,877
Yes, my lord.

327
00:42:11,584 --> 00:42:14,044
Is there something wrong?

328
00:42:14,044 --> 00:42:17,461
No, keep going.

329
00:42:21,584 --> 00:42:24,584
That's enough training for today.

330
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:27,584
You should meditate for
the remainder of the day.

331
00:42:27,584 --> 00:42:29,584
What?

332
00:42:42,668 --> 00:42:45,584
Excuse me.

333
00:42:45,584 --> 00:42:48,169
Yes, go on, please...

334
00:42:59,419 --> 00:43:00,710
Look here.

335
00:43:03,584 --> 00:43:06,377
Yes?

336
00:43:06,377 --> 00:43:09,877
Is Prince Youngsung back yet?

337
00:43:09,877 --> 00:43:14,584
He went into training as soon as
he got back from the Royal Academy.

338
00:43:14,584 --> 00:43:16,127
Training?

339
00:43:28,627 --> 00:43:31,584
I already made up my mind.

340
00:43:31,584 --> 00:43:35,461
We're going into spiritual training today.

341
00:43:35,461 --> 00:43:36,919
No, we can't do that, Mr. Cho!

342
00:43:36,919 --> 00:43:39,584
You saw Prince Moonsung, too!

343
00:43:39,584 --> 00:43:42,584
I don't have time if I
want to catch up to him!

344
00:43:42,584 --> 00:43:46,044
Impatience will only ruin your health.

345
00:43:46,044 --> 00:43:48,752
How many times do I have to tell you?

346
00:43:48,752 --> 00:43:52,710
Your greatest enemy is yourself!

347
00:43:52,710 --> 00:44:01,336
Meditate until you wash away all
your competitiveness and anxiety.

348
00:44:01,336 --> 00:44:02,152
But...

349
00:44:02,152 --> 00:44:04,584
Martial art is an expression of the spirit.

350
00:44:04,584 --> 00:44:11,584
There's no point in training because
you've lost your composure.

351
00:44:11,584 --> 00:44:18,086
If you don't do as I say,
I won't help you anymore.

352
00:44:38,584 --> 00:44:39,960
Your Highness!

353
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,835
Your Highness!

354
00:44:42,835 --> 00:44:44,835
Are you okay?

355
00:44:44,835 --> 00:44:47,169
Your Highness!

356
00:44:47,169 --> 00:44:49,627
What's wrong?

357
00:44:49,627 --> 00:44:51,584
My arm... all of a sudden...

358
00:44:51,584 --> 00:44:53,884
Let me take a look.

359
00:44:53,884 --> 00:44:57,180
Ahhhh!

360
00:45:00,584 --> 00:45:03,585
Please be careful.

361
00:45:03,585 --> 00:45:08,584
I think it's a temporary loss
of muscle function due to shock.

362
00:45:08,584 --> 00:45:14,584
The cause seems to be from
overstraining your body.

363
00:45:14,584 --> 00:45:19,794
How long will it take before
the pain goes away?

364
00:45:19,794 --> 00:45:27,584
You'll get better with some rest,
but I don't know how long it'll take.

365
00:45:27,584 --> 00:45:30,252
What did you say?

366
00:45:30,252 --> 00:45:32,585
Is there a way I can get better soon?

367
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:35,584
I'm short on time.

368
00:45:35,584 --> 00:45:40,710
There's a chance you won't
recover before the duel.

369
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:46,377
Your Highness, I think
you should rest for now.

370
00:45:57,585 --> 00:46:00,584
Your Highness.

371
00:46:00,584 --> 00:46:02,752
Your Highness!

372
00:46:02,752 --> 00:46:04,584
Don't.

373
00:46:04,584 --> 00:46:07,127
Go inside and rest.

374
00:46:07,127 --> 00:46:07,752
But...

375
00:46:07,877 --> 00:46:12,336
If you overwork yourself now, you
won't be able to move in the future.

376
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:17,086
If this keeps up, you'll lose before
you even get a chance to compete.

377
00:46:19,752 --> 00:46:21,919
Please sit.

378
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:33,377
You can't have a duel in this condition.

379
00:46:33,377 --> 00:46:37,252
Why don't you talk to Her Majesty
and postpone the duel date?

380
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:39,503
No.

381
00:46:39,503 --> 00:46:41,585
Martial arts is all about self-control.

382
00:46:41,627 --> 00:46:45,544
If I postpone the duel because
I couldn't control my body,

383
00:46:45,544 --> 00:46:47,877
that's like admitting that I lost.

384
00:46:47,877 --> 00:46:48,584
But...

385
00:46:48,584 --> 00:46:54,960
His Highness is right.

386
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:01,584
Mr. Cho, does this mean I'm going
to lose without even fighting?

387
00:48:24,877 --> 00:48:30,584
Attendant Yang, what are you looking at?

388
00:48:30,584 --> 00:48:33,877
It's easy to see stars in Onyang
because the sky here is clear.

389
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,584
You're so weird.

390
00:48:35,584 --> 00:48:41,584
No one talks about stars anymore.

391
00:48:41,584 --> 00:48:44,877
See that bright star over there?

392
00:48:44,877 --> 00:48:46,584
That's the North Star.

393
00:48:46,584 --> 00:48:52,086
Wow, it really is bright.
Do you like the North Star?

394
00:48:54,584 --> 00:48:56,584
Yes.

395
00:48:56,584 --> 00:49:02,294
You should go home. We'll be
busy starting from tomorrow.

396
00:49:43,835 --> 00:49:46,461
What are you looking at?

397
00:49:49,584 --> 00:49:52,710
I'm trying to find the North Star.

398
00:49:52,710 --> 00:50:03,584
Yang Sooneui told me it's the star that
keeps its place in the center of the sky.

399
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:07,584
Is she that school friend?

400
00:50:07,584 --> 00:50:09,584
Yes.

401
00:50:12,584 --> 00:50:20,584
I realized I've been too impatient
with this assignment.

402
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:27,584
This happened to be because
I was in such a hurry.

403
00:50:27,584 --> 00:50:34,002
Being in a hurry wouldn't
make me get what I want.

404
00:50:34,002 --> 00:50:39,584
Now that this has happened to my arm,
I feel as though I've already lost.

405
00:50:39,584 --> 00:50:43,584
It's not over yet.

406
00:50:43,584 --> 00:50:54,584
Reflecting on the past is of
no use if you don't change.

407
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:57,584
It's not too late.

408
00:50:57,584 --> 00:50:59,710
Realizing your mistake and overcoming

409
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:08,584
your flaws is part of the
spiritual training of martial arts.

410
00:51:08,584 --> 00:51:13,584
Now that you've realized what
you lack, you can say that

411
00:51:13,584 --> 00:51:21,752
you've gained something more
important than winning or losing.

412
00:51:21,919 --> 00:51:26,584
I think I'm beginning to understand
what it means to reflect on myself.

413
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:30,585
Now is the time.

414
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,877
Try moving your arm.

415
00:52:23,461 --> 00:52:25,584
What happened?

416
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:30,877
I can move.

417
00:52:30,919 --> 00:52:34,584
I only helped your energy circulate.

418
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:37,584
This is only a temporary solution.

419
00:52:37,584 --> 00:52:43,169
If you're not careful, you won't
be able to use your arm again.

420
00:52:43,169 --> 00:52:45,211
I see.

421
00:52:58,919 --> 00:53:01,584
Your Highness!

422
00:53:01,584 --> 00:53:04,960
I think you should rest for the duel.

423
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,584
Where's Prince Moonsung?

424
00:53:08,584 --> 00:53:15,584
Pardon? Oh, he already went
to Onyang Palace today.

425
00:53:15,584 --> 00:53:16,584
What?

426
00:53:16,584 --> 00:53:21,584
He said he wanted to get used
to the drill hall beforehand.

427
00:53:39,584 --> 00:53:41,584
Attendant Yang.

428
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:50,584
Can you clean up the arching
arena after you're done?

429
00:53:50,584 --> 00:53:53,127
Yes, Lady.

430
00:54:26,169 --> 00:54:28,584
Your Highness Prince Moonsung!

431
00:54:37,044 --> 00:54:40,044
You're early.

432
00:54:40,044 --> 00:54:45,002
I wanted to get used to the arena beforehand.

433
00:54:45,002 --> 00:54:48,919
As always, you're very serious about this.

434
00:54:48,919 --> 00:54:50,584
Of course.

435
00:54:50,584 --> 00:54:55,584
I can't afford to make the same
mistake like I did with "Gunsangokdo."

436
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:59,336
I'm glad you're doing fine.

437
00:55:00,752 --> 00:55:03,086
Do I look like I'm doing fine?

438
00:55:03,086 --> 00:55:06,002
Pardon?

439
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:12,584
I wasn't doing fine at all since you left.

440
00:55:12,584 --> 00:55:16,584
I'm sure Prince Youngsung feels the same way.

441
00:55:16,584 --> 00:55:18,584
Your Highness...

442
00:55:22,584 --> 00:55:27,002
Are you used to this place now?

443
00:55:27,002 --> 00:55:31,044
I'd like to take a tour.

444
00:55:31,044 --> 00:55:36,584
I know you're working right now,
but can you show me around?

445
00:55:41,086 --> 00:55:53,794
This lake has a great view, especially
if you look down from up there.

446
00:55:53,794 --> 00:55:57,584
I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

447
00:56:04,877 --> 00:56:07,584
Miss Sooneui.

448
00:56:07,584 --> 00:56:10,377
Yes?

449
00:56:10,377 --> 00:56:14,584
Why don't you come back to Seoul?

450
00:56:16,668 --> 00:56:22,584
I know the deal you made with my mother.

451
00:56:22,584 --> 00:56:25,503
Guess what?

452
00:56:25,503 --> 00:56:31,294
The three wedding rings are
being displayed right now

453
00:56:31,294 --> 00:56:37,668
along with "Gunsangokdo."

454
00:56:37,668 --> 00:56:40,002
Everything's taken care of now.

455
00:56:40,002 --> 00:56:43,211
Although the truth has been sealed,

456
00:56:43,211 --> 00:56:49,503
no one in his right mind
will say something about it.

457
00:56:49,503 --> 00:56:54,584
That means you can come back.

458
00:56:54,584 --> 00:57:00,919
You wanted to attend the Royal Academy.

459
00:57:00,919 --> 00:57:04,877
If you're lucky, you can get
in with special consideration.

460
00:57:04,919 --> 00:57:09,627
Even if you can't make it this
time, you can try next year.

461
00:57:09,752 --> 00:57:13,584
Still, it'll help if you're in Seoul.

462
00:57:15,584 --> 00:57:21,627
I'll take care of the issue with my mother.

463
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:23,252
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

464
00:57:23,252 --> 00:57:24,584
Miss Sooneui.

465
00:57:24,584 --> 00:57:28,584
I think I've been out here too long.

466
00:57:30,503 --> 00:57:33,584
I know you have feelings
for Prince Youngsung.

467
00:57:36,752 --> 00:57:45,584
I've been watching you all this time,
hoping you'll have feelings for me.

468
00:57:45,584 --> 00:57:48,584
Of course I know how you feel.

469
00:57:48,584 --> 00:58:01,584
I know how much pain you
must be going through.

470
00:58:06,252 --> 00:58:15,503
I thought about it after you left, but I
can only come up with one conclusion.

471
00:58:15,503 --> 00:58:20,584
Even though you have
feelings for someone else,

472
00:58:20,584 --> 00:58:23,584
I'm sure you can change with time.

473
00:58:23,585 --> 00:58:24,877
Your Highness.

474
00:58:24,877 --> 00:58:27,584
I feel bad for hurting Saeryung because

475
00:58:27,584 --> 00:58:35,585
I was honest about my
feelings... But, I don't regret it.

476
00:58:35,585 --> 00:58:41,752
It made me gain something important.

477
00:58:41,752 --> 00:58:46,044
You're the one who showed me what that is.

478
00:58:46,044 --> 00:58:48,752
So, I won't give up on you.

479
00:58:59,461 --> 00:59:00,584
Really?

480
00:59:02,877 --> 00:59:05,668
That's great.

481
00:59:05,668 --> 00:59:10,336
Okay, I'll be waiting.

482
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:16,044
Uh... today?

483
00:59:16,044 --> 00:59:19,584
I'm working tonight.

484
00:59:19,584 --> 00:59:26,371
Okay... See you tomorrow, Yongnam... Okay...

485
00:59:34,584 --> 00:59:36,044
It's tomorrow...

486
00:59:56,818 --> 01:00:02,010
[Active and Honest Youth]

487
01:00:10,127 --> 01:00:12,584
[Yang Sooneui]

488
01:00:12,584 --> 01:00:15,877
[Kang Hoo]

489
01:00:17,752 --> 01:00:19,584
Kang Hoo...

490
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:37,377
Your Highness, wake up.

491
01:00:47,752 --> 01:00:50,584
What's wrong with me?

492
01:02:58,141 --> 01:02:59,247
[Prince Hours]

493
01:03:04,617 --> 01:03:09,937
Please do your best for the sake of
the Imperial Court's pride and honor!

494
01:03:09,937 --> 01:03:13,163
Right, there's no way he's
going to lose in archery.

495
01:03:14,949 --> 01:03:18,955
Both princes look dignified, don't they?

496
01:03:19,227 --> 01:03:22,840
We won't know who will
win till it's all over.

497
01:03:24,915 --> 01:03:28,326
Yang Sooneui, I'm asking you one last time.

498
01:03:29,657 --> 01:03:31,642
Let's go back to Seoul together.

499
01:03:32,743 --> 01:03:38,393
Hearing your voice, seeing your face,
and thinking of you is really hard for me.

500
01:03:39,070 --> 01:03:42,036
So, please leave me alone!

501
01:03:42,408 --> 01:03:47,000
I wish you'd always be by my side.

502
01:03:49,093 --> 01:03:54,435
Kang Hoo. From now on, you need to
look after the Imperial Palace

503
01:03:54,435 --> 01:03:57,720
and the people of this country, not me.

504
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:03,711
Don't ever forget that.
