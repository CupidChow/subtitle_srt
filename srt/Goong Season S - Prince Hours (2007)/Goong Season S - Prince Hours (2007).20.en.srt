1
00:00:25,684 --> 00:00:31,612
I miss those days when
we were just naive kids.

2
00:00:31,612 --> 00:00:42,285
I miss those happy days in that
cottage... when we didn't know anything.

3
00:00:57,926 --> 00:01:05,369
Regardless of what you think... You have
to be my son until the day you die!

4
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:09,025
Because you have to be the Emperor!

5
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:21,349
I still can't accept the
feelings you have for me.

6
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:25,158
I don't ever want to see you again!

7
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,011
Young Master!

8
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,428
Young Master!

9
00:01:36,428 --> 00:01:37,969
Young Master!

10
00:01:38,053 --> 00:01:45,602
Young Master!

11
00:01:47,695 --> 00:01:49,058
Young Master!

12
00:01:50,627 --> 00:01:51,781
Young Master!

13
00:01:52,523 --> 00:01:53,698
Young Master!

14
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:19,804
[Prince Hours]

15
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:29,328
This is not the time to discuss
installing the Crown Prince.

16
00:02:29,328 --> 00:02:31,785
The Imperial Court is in danger.

17
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:34,785
The Royal Kin believes

18
00:02:34,785 --> 00:02:39,785
the Crown Prince should be
installed to overcome this crisis.

19
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:43,704
I heard that most of the legislators

20
00:02:43,704 --> 00:02:48,161
who want to dethrone the Empress
are Grand Prince Hyojang's people.

21
00:02:48,161 --> 00:02:52,953
But, it is true that the majority
of the people are dissatisfied

22
00:02:52,953 --> 00:02:59,785
with the Imperial Court over this issue.

23
00:03:01,953 --> 00:03:05,704
Tell the Royal Kin I will soon
make a formal announcement

24
00:03:05,704 --> 00:03:09,495
regarding the installation
of the Crown Prince.

25
00:03:09,495 --> 00:03:10,785
Yes, Your Majesty.

26
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:34,785
Did Siyun die because of me?

27
00:03:34,785 --> 00:03:36,785
The new Crown Prince will soon be announced.

28
00:03:38,995 --> 00:03:41,785
I just need to push the Empress one more time

29
00:03:41,785 --> 00:03:44,785
to make you become the new Emperor.

30
00:03:44,785 --> 00:03:48,120
You should behave yourself until then.

31
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,785
Understand?

32
00:03:48,785 --> 00:03:52,287
You don't even care that Siyun is dead.

33
00:03:54,203 --> 00:03:59,785
She always followed you...
and was so loyal to you...

34
00:03:59,785 --> 00:04:02,828
Make sure you fully recover.

35
00:04:02,828 --> 00:04:08,785
I don't want to let the people
see a sick Crown Prince.

36
00:04:48,785 --> 00:04:50,995
Your name is Sooneui, right?

37
00:04:50,995 --> 00:04:54,453
Yes, my lord.

38
00:04:57,786 --> 00:05:04,785
Do I have to leave the palace after Prince
Moonsung becomes Crown Prince?

39
00:05:04,785 --> 00:05:10,620
Probably, after he becomes fully invested.

40
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:18,786
I feel awful for everyone
because I lost the competition.

41
00:05:20,785 --> 00:05:24,078
I'm very disappointed, too.

42
00:05:24,078 --> 00:05:29,453
After trying so hard, I really wanted to win.

43
00:05:29,453 --> 00:05:34,245
On the other hand, I feel relieved.

44
00:05:35,828 --> 00:05:41,785
I want to marry her after I leave the palace.

45
00:05:56,953 --> 00:05:58,995
This is my father.

46
00:05:59,036 --> 00:06:02,785
He looks a lot like my uncle, huh?

47
00:06:02,785 --> 00:06:05,120
They were twins.

48
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,245
This feels weird.

49
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:16,785
I thought you'd always live
in the Jipyoung Tower.

50
00:06:16,785 --> 00:06:23,785
I can't believe I'm going back
to where my parents used to live.

51
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,245
But, I'm happy that I can be with you.

52
00:06:29,245 --> 00:06:33,785
Let's live the lives our
parents didn't get to live.

53
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,911
I'll probably spend the whole
day cleaning that huge place.

54
00:06:39,911 --> 00:06:42,036
I'll help you.

55
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:45,328
We can repair the places that are worn down.

56
00:06:45,328 --> 00:06:47,036
That's it?

57
00:06:47,036 --> 00:06:54,785
Shouldn't you say something like
"You won't have to lift a finger"?

58
00:06:54,785 --> 00:07:00,620
Yang Sooneui, I don't want to ask for more.

59
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,785
Let's live as though we're not royals.

60
00:07:06,828 --> 00:07:11,203
Let's be happy with what we've got.

61
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:56,036
Did you really visit Grand Prince
Hyosung with that girl?

62
00:07:56,036 --> 00:08:02,370
I told you I'd take it as a show of
contempt if you continue being stubborn.

63
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:08,785
Are you trying to take revenge
on me because of your mother?

64
00:08:08,785 --> 00:08:11,287
Your Highness, we may be young,

65
00:08:11,287 --> 00:08:16,785
but we want to spend the
rest of our lives together.

66
00:08:16,785 --> 00:08:23,620
Besides, I'm now a mere royal who
can't be Crown Prince anymore.

67
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:28,785
Can't you be more understanding?

68
00:08:28,785 --> 00:08:34,785
I don't want to disobey you.

69
00:08:45,785 --> 00:08:49,662
What are you doing here, Lady Han?

70
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:53,785
I've been waiting here because
I thought I should tell you this

71
00:08:53,785 --> 00:08:55,869
even if it costs me my job.

72
00:08:55,869 --> 00:09:01,287
Please do not punish Attendant Yang Sooneui.

73
00:09:01,287 --> 00:09:05,203
I can't believe I'm hearing this from you.

74
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:11,785
I know what you're concerned about.

75
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:15,578
Prince Youngsung and Attendant Yang's
relationship is very similar to

76
00:09:15,578 --> 00:09:22,120
that of Prince Youngsung's parents.

77
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:29,412
You should just stick to the
rules, just as you always do.

78
00:09:29,412 --> 00:09:35,785
The Imperial Court seemed to find peace
after sending Grand Duchess Hyoin away,

79
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:40,828
but that was tragic for the Imperial Court.

80
00:09:40,828 --> 00:09:46,785
That's why I don't want to
make the same mistake again.

81
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:55,745
You fully supported
the Grand Prince's matrimony.

82
00:09:55,745 --> 00:10:06,036
I remember what you said to persuade the
Royal Kin who were against that marriage.

83
00:10:06,036 --> 00:10:11,785
I'll just reiterate your words back to you.

84
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:20,869
"You can't use force to separate
people who are in love."

85
00:10:20,869 --> 00:10:29,620
"If you do, it can make everyone unhappy."

86
00:10:38,257 --> 00:10:39,449
Hey!

87
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:42,239
Holding on to that worry bear
won't make your worries go away.

88
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:44,457
You're like this because of
Prince Youngsung, aren't you?

89
00:10:48,277 --> 00:10:52,397
He's moving out of the palace soon.
What's there to worry about?

90
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,114
But... that doesn't mean the Imperial
Court will accept you as his bride.

91
00:11:00,114 --> 00:11:02,498
They even kicked you out of the Academy.

92
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:30,395
Don't you think the attendants
have become more polite to us?

93
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,995
It seems like yesterday that
you came to live here.

94
00:11:37,728 --> 00:11:42,848
You'll probably move into the
Crown Prince's Palace after the ceremony.

95
00:11:42,848 --> 00:11:43,718
Does that make you that happy?

96
00:11:43,718 --> 00:11:50,940
Of course! It's been a lifelong
dream of your father and me.

97
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:55,978
Do you think... I deserve
to be Crown Prince?

98
00:11:59,163 --> 00:12:00,790
What are you talking about?

99
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:11,151
You will be the greatest Emperor
ever! I can already see it.

100
00:12:11,151 --> 00:12:16,195
How can I become Emperor when
I'm not of a royal descent?

101
00:12:17,048 --> 00:12:21,378
What do you mean you're not of royal descent?

102
00:12:21,378 --> 00:12:26,634
Mother, you know very well what I mean.

103
00:12:29,407 --> 00:12:35,044
You didn't meet Cho Sangki, did you?

104
00:12:38,794 --> 00:12:49,362
No! He's got it all wrong! You are most
certainly of royal descent! Trust me!

105
00:12:51,109 --> 00:12:53,719
You're your father's son no matter what!

106
00:12:53,719 --> 00:13:02,426
Mr. Cho didn't tell me.
Father told me himself.

107
00:13:02,426 --> 00:13:09,816
What? What... What did you just say?

108
00:13:09,816 --> 00:13:16,308
It was Father who told me. He already knew.

109
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:52,578
Is something wrong? Your face gives it away.

110
00:13:53,995 --> 00:13:57,785
Tell me what's wrong.

111
00:14:00,785 --> 00:14:05,785
How can you say that?

112
00:14:05,785 --> 00:14:17,287
I heard from Joon you
don't think he's your son.

113
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:24,203
My heart broke when I heard that.

114
00:14:24,203 --> 00:14:27,704
What are you trying to say?

115
00:14:27,704 --> 00:14:30,578
Are you telling me that Joon is my son?

116
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:34,203
Joon is your son!

117
00:14:34,203 --> 00:14:38,161
Do you think I believe you?

118
00:14:38,161 --> 00:14:43,785
You've been sleeping around
behind my back for years,

119
00:14:43,785 --> 00:14:49,412
and now you expect me to
believe that he's my son?

120
00:14:49,412 --> 00:14:51,953
Don't be surprised.

121
00:14:51,953 --> 00:14:56,328
Don't try to fool me with your dumb lies.

122
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,785
Do you think I'll buy that?

123
00:14:58,785 --> 00:15:02,203
Fine.

124
00:15:02,203 --> 00:15:13,203
In the past, I did rely on another man
because I was sick of how cold you were.

125
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:21,911
But, Joon is definitely your son.

126
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:30,911
Do you know what I hated about myself?

127
00:15:30,911 --> 00:15:37,785
I... can't conceive a child.

128
00:15:37,785 --> 00:15:41,412
I once visited a doctor
to remove a gallstone,

129
00:15:41,412 --> 00:15:49,203
and heard I couldn't conceive a child.

130
00:15:49,203 --> 00:15:55,370
And, now you're telling me
that Joon is my real son?

131
00:15:56,785 --> 00:15:59,785
You're wrong.

132
00:15:59,785 --> 00:16:02,785
Joon is your son.

133
00:16:02,785 --> 00:16:06,620
Joon is definitely your son!

134
00:16:07,911 --> 00:16:10,785
Stop lying to me!

135
00:16:10,785 --> 00:16:14,578
Then, how about this?

136
00:16:16,911 --> 00:16:21,785
Take a paternity test.

137
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:08,370
I only ask you don't stain my parents' honor.

138
00:17:13,785 --> 00:17:15,662
Sit down.

139
00:17:20,911 --> 00:17:24,704
What are you here for today?

140
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,953
I'll give you a chance to confess.

141
00:17:28,953 --> 00:17:31,287
Confess?

142
00:17:31,287 --> 00:17:33,328
How rude of you!

143
00:17:33,328 --> 00:17:35,412
What nonsense is this?

144
00:17:35,412 --> 00:17:40,657
In order to keep a promise I made to
someone, and for the Imperial Court's honor,

145
00:17:40,657 --> 00:17:44,480
I won't tell the public about
your wrongdoings.

146
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:50,785
But, you should apologize to my parents

147
00:17:50,785 --> 00:17:56,078
who lived and died in sadness
after being framed.

148
00:17:56,078 --> 00:17:58,120
You wretch!

149
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,953
How dare you try to fool me!

150
00:18:01,995 --> 00:18:05,785
Do you have evidence to support that?

151
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:10,245
If you do, you should show it to us first.

152
00:18:10,245 --> 00:18:15,785
I'm here to give myself a chance
to forgive the two of you.

153
00:18:15,785 --> 00:18:20,785
I don't know why you're doing
this, but you're wrong.

154
00:18:20,785 --> 00:18:23,785
We have nothing to do with
what happened to your mother.

155
00:18:23,786 --> 00:18:28,704
Fine, then. In the name of truth and justice,

156
00:18:28,704 --> 00:18:33,953
you two will pay the price for
ruining my parents' lives.

157
00:18:33,995 --> 00:18:36,785
Do you think so?

158
00:18:36,785 --> 00:18:40,370
Truth and justice can change
depending on who has the power.

159
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,785
No.

160
00:18:41,828 --> 00:18:45,786
Truth and justice can be
downtrodden for a moment,

161
00:18:45,786 --> 00:18:50,745
but you can't crush it forever with power.

162
00:18:59,786 --> 00:19:02,785
He's onto something.

163
00:19:02,785 --> 00:19:06,785
I can tell from looking at his eyes.

164
00:19:06,785 --> 00:19:11,203
But, no matter how I think
about it, I don't understand.

165
00:19:11,203 --> 00:19:20,036
If he really does have evidence,
he can just talk to the Empress.

166
00:19:20,036 --> 00:19:26,120
He's probably just bluffing like
you said last time.

167
00:19:27,785 --> 00:19:30,786
If only Siyun was here...

168
00:19:56,475 --> 00:20:03,305
I never once in my life thought
about rebelling against my destiny.

169
00:20:05,411 --> 00:20:11,620
As a royal, as a prince... I did
everything my father told me to do.

170
00:20:15,728 --> 00:20:20,433
But, I slowly began to
change after meeting you.

171
00:20:24,888 --> 00:20:32,015
And, that was a hard wall to break.

172
00:20:32,015 --> 00:20:37,860
I was too preoccupied with my own
feelings that I made you suffer.

173
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:46,586
Because I was hurting,
I didn't consider your feelings.

174
00:20:54,255 --> 00:21:00,626
There were so many things I wanted to
do for you, but I couldn't do anything.

175
00:21:10,904 --> 00:21:19,485
I'll stop now. I won't go any further.

176
00:21:22,636 --> 00:21:24,617
This time, it's for my own sake.

177
00:21:29,685 --> 00:21:35,657
I won't forget all the things
you've taught me.

178
00:21:47,948 --> 00:21:52,996
I really hoped you would become Crown Prince.

179
00:21:55,527 --> 00:22:08,000
I know. I was always grateful to you,
and indebted to you at the same time.

180
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:12,012
We're too different, aren't we?

181
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:19,508
You think I would've had a chance if you
had lived in the palace from the beginning,

182
00:22:19,508 --> 00:22:26,060
or if I had been your elementary
school classmate?

183
00:22:38,673 --> 00:22:46,069
Here... I wanted to give you something.

184
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:51,477
It's a plane ticket to New York.

185
00:22:54,128 --> 00:23:04,245
This might be out of line, but I
thought you might want to go there.

186
00:23:09,492 --> 00:23:12,933
I always felt that you miss your mother.

187
00:23:15,076 --> 00:23:21,156
Don't try to hide it anymore.
Go and tell her directly.

188
00:23:21,156 --> 00:23:23,138
Tell her that you missed her.

189
00:23:34,838 --> 00:23:40,965
We can be good friends, right?

190
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,237
Of course.

191
00:24:25,252 --> 00:24:30,092
I hope I didn't alarm you
by calling all of a sudden.

192
00:24:31,113 --> 00:24:33,655
Not at all, Your Highness.

193
00:24:35,955 --> 00:24:42,484
The more I look at you, the more you
resemble Prince Youngsung's mother.

194
00:25:52,062 --> 00:25:56,059
[Prince Hours]

195
00:25:59,944 --> 00:26:04,819
Today, we will now announce
the outcome of the competition,

196
00:26:04,819 --> 00:26:09,609
and decide who will be Crown Prince.

197
00:26:13,528 --> 00:26:27,486
As you can see, it was a
2-1-2 tie until the Virtue round.

198
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:36,609
Prince Moonsung won the Virtue round,
with the final score of 3-1-2.

199
00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:43,609
We announce that Prince Moonsung
is the final winner.

200
00:26:49,569 --> 00:26:52,609
Wait, Your Majesty.

201
00:26:55,902 --> 00:27:00,609
I'm not qualified to be Crown Prince.

202
00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:05,609
I cheated several times
during the competition

203
00:27:05,609 --> 00:27:09,693
in order to beat Prince Youngsung.

204
00:27:14,735 --> 00:27:19,277
Prince Moonsung, is that true?

205
00:27:19,277 --> 00:27:24,609
Remember, you must not tell a lie
from where you are sitting right now.

206
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:28,609
I know.

207
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:32,609
Your Majesty, please punish me
for giving into temptation

208
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:38,402
in order to become Crown Prince.

209
00:27:39,652 --> 00:27:47,609
I respect Prince Youngsung for catching
up to me even though I hindered him.

210
00:27:47,609 --> 00:27:50,985
I'm confessing my wrongdoings
because I've been touched by

211
00:27:50,985 --> 00:27:57,444
how Prince Youngsung fought fairly.

212
00:27:57,444 --> 00:28:02,152
Prince Youngsung should be Crown Prince.

213
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,944
Let me ask you one more time.

214
00:28:06,944 --> 00:28:09,735
Can you stand by your word?

215
00:28:09,735 --> 00:28:11,609
Your Majesty! Wait!

216
00:28:11,609 --> 00:28:13,944
Grand Prince, be quiet!

217
00:28:13,944 --> 00:28:19,609
I'm asking Prince Moonsung
a question right now!

218
00:28:26,777 --> 00:28:29,609
Of course.

219
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:34,944
I will forfeit the seat of Crown Prince
regardless of what the outcome is.

220
00:28:35,027 --> 00:28:41,609
I recommend Prince Youngsung
because he's qualified for the position.

221
00:29:19,609 --> 00:29:23,609
Everything's over now.
What did you want to see me about?

222
00:29:23,609 --> 00:29:33,609
Do you remember the embezzlement scandal
from 20 years ago which you investigated?

223
00:29:56,609 --> 00:30:01,236
I can't let Grand Duchess
Hyoin take the blame.

224
00:30:01,236 --> 00:30:04,609
Are you saying we should watch
our lives go down the gutter?

225
00:30:04,609 --> 00:30:11,609
Director, you have a family to take care of!

226
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:12,985
But...

227
00:30:12,985 --> 00:30:17,236
It's a good thing that Grand Duchess
Hyoin is the new director.

228
00:30:17,236 --> 00:30:19,609
Once the Imperial Court is in danger,

229
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:24,609
the Royal Kin won't hesitate to kick out
the Grand Duchess who's a commoner.

230
00:30:24,609 --> 00:30:31,693
You should act wisely if you don't
want your life to be over like this.

231
00:30:55,609 --> 00:31:01,652
Like I promised, I will not stain
your honor in front of the public.

232
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:05,944
The press will never write
anything about your parents.

233
00:31:05,944 --> 00:31:10,609
Only the articles to restore
my mother's honor will be written.

234
00:31:14,735 --> 00:31:17,528
Thank you, Prince Moonsung.

235
00:31:19,609 --> 00:31:23,609
This may be an odd question,
but why did you give up?

236
00:31:23,609 --> 00:31:29,277
It wasn't mine from the beginning.

237
00:31:29,277 --> 00:31:31,902
But, you're different.

238
00:31:31,902 --> 00:31:34,486
You might not be aware of this,

239
00:31:34,486 --> 00:31:40,819
but you were probably meant to be
in the palace from the beginning.

240
00:31:53,637 --> 00:32:01,220
Did you really want the
throne that badly, Uncle?

241
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:07,363
You have no idea. The feeling
of being unable to have power,

242
00:32:07,363 --> 00:32:12,734
even though you're so close to getting
it just because your blood is different.

243
00:32:13,829 --> 00:32:21,814
You must never forget. While I dedicated
my whole life to get on the throne,

244
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:24,916
you took it so easily just
because you were born to it.

245
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:31,480
Yet, you've risked the future of
the Imperial Court for love...

246
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,659
You don't know how hateful
and resentful that makes me.

247
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:56,428
Maybe it was yours from the beginning.

248
00:32:56,428 --> 00:33:02,885
You never asked for it, but it
somehow found its way to you.

249
00:33:02,885 --> 00:33:07,509
We somehow found each other, too.

250
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:12,802
Being the Crown Prince
doesn't change anything

251
00:33:12,802 --> 00:33:15,509
as long as we feel the same
way about each other.

252
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:18,510
I'll try hard, too.

253
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:25,177
Just put your trust in me, okay?

254
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:30,509
Of course, I will.

255
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:33,344
After all, this is coming from
a fabulous man like you.

256
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,802
Yes, I am fabulous.

257
00:33:35,802 --> 00:33:39,509
I'm perfect in every way.

258
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:43,428
You're so full of yourself.

259
00:33:43,428 --> 00:33:47,510
You know I hate it when you say that!

260
00:34:08,552 --> 00:34:11,219
I have to use the restroom.

261
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:16,052
You won't get lost, right? Hurry on back.

262
00:35:08,509 --> 00:35:10,509
To Incheon Airport, please.

263
00:35:34,084 --> 00:35:37,946
[To my first love, the Crown Prince of Korea]

264
00:35:43,927 --> 00:35:45,509
Did you know?

265
00:35:45,509 --> 00:35:50,509
I had a crush on you for the longest time.

266
00:35:50,509 --> 00:35:54,760
Remember your first day of school?

267
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:00,927
My skirt flew in the air because
I ran into you and fell.

268
00:36:00,927 --> 00:36:03,509
You made fun of me...

269
00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:13,885
but I thought to myself, "I must
marry this man when I grow up."

270
00:36:13,885 --> 00:36:20,509
Maybe that's why everything
you did seemed fine with me.

271
00:36:20,509 --> 00:36:23,052
I wanted to make nice things for you,

272
00:36:23,052 --> 00:36:30,011
share my lunch with you,
and do your homework for you.

273
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:39,509
I thought it was just puppy love,
but look where we are now.

274
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,509
Hoo? Kang Hoo?

275
00:37:05,509 --> 00:37:14,469
But, they say that first
loves don't come true.

276
00:37:14,469 --> 00:37:17,219
I think I'll stop now.

277
00:37:17,219 --> 00:37:19,509
I don't want to ask for more.

278
00:37:19,509 --> 00:37:24,052
I've been happy.

279
00:37:34,509 --> 00:37:35,552
Attendant Ma!

280
00:37:35,552 --> 00:37:38,011
Your Highness!

281
00:37:38,011 --> 00:37:40,136
Do you know where Yang Sooneui is?

282
00:37:40,136 --> 00:37:43,011
Today's the day.

283
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,261
The Imperial Court Scholarship Federation
accepted her application to study abroad...

284
00:37:45,261 --> 00:37:47,302
Study abroad?

285
00:37:47,302 --> 00:37:49,719
She said she had already
talked to you about it.

286
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:51,885
I was with her the entire evening.

287
00:37:51,885 --> 00:37:52,509
Does that mean...

288
00:37:52,509 --> 00:37:54,509
She's on the plane.

289
00:37:54,509 --> 00:37:57,509
She called me 30 minutes ago.

290
00:38:12,509 --> 00:38:20,509
Thank you for being someone
I can watch from anywhere.

291
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:27,302
I'll always cheer you on.

292
00:38:30,509 --> 00:38:38,509
The appeal for dethronement
was rejected thanks to you.

293
00:38:38,509 --> 00:38:42,509
I'm honored, Your Highness.

294
00:38:42,509 --> 00:38:45,177
I'm so relieved.

295
00:38:45,177 --> 00:38:49,509
But, we still have many
challenges ahead of us.

296
00:38:49,509 --> 00:38:54,552
Even though Prince Youngsung is Crown
Prince, his future is still insecure.

297
00:38:54,552 --> 00:38:56,927
Please do not worry.

298
00:38:56,927 --> 00:39:02,509
I will always support the Imperial Court.

299
00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:11,509
Then, all that's left to discuss the wedding
between Prince Youngsung and Miss Saeryung.

300
00:39:11,509 --> 00:39:18,509
Excuse me, but may I say
something, Your Majesty?

301
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:27,509
I hope you'll call this marriage off.

302
00:39:27,509 --> 00:39:29,509
What are you talking about?

303
00:39:29,509 --> 00:39:36,219
Forgive me for saying this

304
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:40,552
even when the two of you had
given me undeserved love.

305
00:39:40,593 --> 00:39:44,509
I've been asking for more than I deserve.

306
00:39:44,509 --> 00:39:50,510
But, now I know how much I don't
deserve to be Prince Youngsung's wife.

307
00:39:57,552 --> 00:39:59,509
What the heck were you thinking?

308
00:39:59,509 --> 00:40:03,509
You were so close to realizing your dream!

309
00:40:03,509 --> 00:40:07,885
Never mind that attendant he likes...

310
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:12,969
Is that how you used Mom?

311
00:40:15,509 --> 00:40:22,509
I've been resenting Mom, but I
think I can now understand her.

312
00:40:26,177 --> 00:40:28,969
She was sick of seeing you using
everyone, including family members

313
00:40:28,969 --> 00:40:34,509
in order to gain and maintain power.

314
00:40:34,509 --> 00:40:39,052
I think I know what I've been doing wrong.

315
00:40:43,635 --> 00:40:51,635
I shouldn't make the same
mistake if I fall in love again.

[DNA Analysis]

317
00:41:22,011 --> 00:41:34,469
Father, I'm going to leave you now.

318
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:43,509
Although I'm leaving you, I will always
be grateful to you for having raised me.

319
00:41:45,509 --> 00:41:50,302
I have one last favor to ask of you.

320
00:41:50,302 --> 00:41:54,802
Please forgive Mother.

321
00:41:54,802 --> 00:41:57,011
Goodbye.

Father...

329
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:30,885
You didn't even know that he's your real son.

330
00:43:30,885 --> 00:43:36,177
For all your life, you couldn't
even trust your own wife and son.

331
00:43:36,177 --> 00:43:43,428
Is there anyone in this world who's
crueler and more pitiful than you are?

332

333

What are you talking about?

00:43:50,509 --> 00:43:56,509
Why don't you read that document
in front of your father?

335
00:44:09,885 --> 00:44:15,719
Then, why did Mr. Cho tell me...

336
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:19,552
I lied to him.

337
00:44:19,552 --> 00:44:23,509
I only did it to get the evidence from him.

338
00:44:25,509 --> 00:44:29,760
I did it for you.

339
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:37,509
I'm willing to do anything to save my son.

340
00:44:45,844 --> 00:44:53,927
For the rest of my life, I will pay
the price for my past wrongdoings.

how you used your son without
giving him the love he deserves.

343
00:45:35,927 --> 00:45:39,509
I wanted to stay by your side till the end.

344
00:45:39,509 --> 00:45:45,509
But, because I've been fooled by
one woman's lies, I did you wrong.

345
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:50,677
I've been too ashamed to go and talk to you.

346
00:45:50,677 --> 00:45:57,302
My petty talent unexpectedly
led me to a job overseas.

347
00:45:57,302 --> 00:46:03,593
I will repent of my wrongdoings
for the rest of my life.

348
00:46:14,677 --> 00:46:19,509
Your Highness, it's time to depart.

349
00:46:19,509 --> 00:46:21,509
Okay.

350
00:46:44,509 --> 00:46:47,635
[3 Years Later]

351
00:47:01,509 --> 00:47:05,885
Your pizza's here. Enjoy it!

352
00:47:10,509 --> 00:47:12,261
[Server of the Day: Crown Prince Youngsung]

353
00:47:12,261 --> 00:47:15,509
Your pizza's here. Enjoy!

354
00:47:15,509 --> 00:47:18,136
- What about ours?
- Wait a second!

355
00:47:18,136 --> 00:47:19,635
Can I get your autograph?

356
00:47:19,635 --> 00:47:22,509
- What's your name?
- Seohye!

357
00:47:22,509 --> 00:47:23,509
Me, too!

358
00:47:23,509 --> 00:47:25,635
Hold on.

359
00:47:25,635 --> 00:47:27,705
- What's your name?
- Saejin.

360
00:47:27,705 --> 00:47:28,882
Saejin...

361
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:32,635
Hwangga! Two gorgonzolas, one sweet potato.

362
00:47:32,635 --> 00:47:35,428
- Okay!
- What's this?

363
00:47:35,428 --> 00:47:36,094
Chicken pizza.

364
00:47:36,094 --> 00:47:37,509
Chicken pizza?

365
00:47:40,509 --> 00:47:43,162
Hello, thanks for calling.
This is Palace Pizza!

366
00:47:43,162 --> 00:47:44,612
Oh, yes! Yes, yes...

367
00:47:46,428 --> 00:47:49,509
Daewon Apartment, Apt. No. 811.

368
00:47:49,509 --> 00:47:51,844
Delivery for one fusion pizza.

369
00:47:51,844 --> 00:47:54,677
Yes, thank you! Thank you for ordering!

370
00:47:56,719 --> 00:48:01,509
- Hey! Hurry.
- Okay.

371
00:48:01,509 --> 00:48:03,593
Going home already?

372
00:48:03,593 --> 00:48:06,509
Hey, your place is doing great, boss.

373
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:11,386
Yes, it's a huge hit. What did I tell you?

374
00:48:11,386 --> 00:48:13,509
How's Mr. Cho doing nowadays?

375
00:48:13,509 --> 00:48:17,509
Captain Min hooked him up with
a job in... what country was that?

376
00:48:17,509 --> 00:48:19,509
- Du... Du...
- Oh, Dubai!

377
00:48:19,509 --> 00:48:21,844
He's a Royal Guard in Dubai.

378
00:48:21,844 --> 00:48:23,719
He's doing fine.

379
00:48:23,719 --> 00:48:25,593
That's nice to hear.

380
00:48:25,635 --> 00:48:27,011
I have to go.

381
00:48:27,011 --> 00:48:31,509
Already? So sad! You'll come again, right?

382
00:48:31,509 --> 00:48:33,719
Of course! I'll visit more often.

383
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:35,219
See you later.

384
00:48:35,219 --> 00:48:37,375
Hey! You two should stay and help out.

385
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,971
- Oh, yeah!
- Yes!

386
00:48:53,257 --> 00:48:59,708
These apartment-type rooms are available
from 820 to 2,600 square feet... Also...

387
00:49:17,364 --> 00:49:22,675
Our senior-care residential complex is
in Subic, a key city in the Philippines.

388
00:49:22,675 --> 00:49:29,077
It's an apartment complex with
excellent recreational facilities nearby.

389
00:49:29,077 --> 00:49:36,045
Our residents have easy
access to the facilities...

390
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,428
So, what do you think of the place?

391
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:59,048
You've put in so much effort and heart
into this. It's really impressive.

392
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,604
So, the Philippines was your benchmarker?

393
00:50:02,604 --> 00:50:07,613
Yes. The Philippines is very successful
in building world-class senior homes.

394
00:50:07,613 --> 00:50:12,511
I thought it would be a good idea to import
models that are practical and satisfactory.

395
00:50:12,511 --> 00:50:18,607
You're right. To the elderly, having a
hospital and stores nearby is really great.

396
00:50:19,858 --> 00:50:22,067
Oh, I heard there's also a gift.

397
00:50:22,067 --> 00:50:24,306
Yes. Eunuch Kwak?

398
00:50:24,306 --> 00:50:25,812
Yes, Your Highness!

399
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:31,251
So many elderly people have hearing problems.

400
00:50:31,251 --> 00:50:33,400
So, were giving these
hearing aids away as a gift.

401
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,197
Do I put this in my ear? Ow...

402
00:50:36,197 --> 00:50:41,872
Your Highness! It doesn't go in
the ear, but hooks from behind.

403
00:50:43,995 --> 00:50:50,337
This place was put together with attention to
every detail. No wonder it's so popular.

404
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:58,876
I extremely saddened to see Grand
Chamberlain leave the palace.

405
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:09,237
I've spent my whole life in the palace,
and have received your wonderful kindness.

406
00:51:09,237 --> 00:51:18,516
Now that the place is stable, I can
leave the palace with some levity.

407
00:51:18,516 --> 00:51:24,264
I couldn't say no since he
is determined to leave.

408
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:32,160
As he proposed, I plan to have
Madam Chamberlain succeed him.

409
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:36,058
Oh, is that right?

410
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,178
Thank you for all your hard work.

411
00:51:41,178 --> 00:51:43,134
I am honored, Your Highness.

412
00:51:43,134 --> 00:51:49,412
But if Madam Chamberlain takes over,
she's going to have more work to do.

413
00:51:49,412 --> 00:51:56,879
When will she get married?

414
00:51:56,879 --> 00:51:59,281
Speaking of the devil...

415
00:52:04,386 --> 00:52:09,256
Your Majesty, the office of the
Prime Minister has requested

416
00:52:09,256 --> 00:52:12,812
to postpone today's one-on-one meeting.

417
00:52:14,362 --> 00:52:21,795
How many times has he postponed this?
No prime minister ever has done such a thing.

418
00:52:22,471 --> 00:52:25,736
He's taking you for a fool...

419
00:52:25,736 --> 00:52:30,340
I am sorry to inform you,
but according to our sources,

420
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:38,328
he's been gathering support
to overthrow the Imperial Court.

421
00:53:07,477 --> 00:53:13,309
The Prime Minister is becoming more powerful.

422
00:53:13,309 --> 00:53:16,309
He's been increasingly hostile
to the Imperial Court

423
00:53:16,309 --> 00:53:21,309
after the marriage with the
Crown Prince was called off.

424
00:53:21,309 --> 00:53:26,309
I need you to protect the
Imperial Court as an elder.

425
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:33,560
Why are you asking me this when
you know what I've done in the past?

426
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:40,852
I know you don't want to see
the Imperial Court be destroyed.

427
00:54:10,435 --> 00:54:11,685
Hello...

428
00:54:11,685 --> 00:54:13,811
Assemblyman Kim!

429
00:54:13,811 --> 00:54:16,519
It's me, Hyojang.

430
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:18,852
Yes, it's been a while.

431
00:54:18,852 --> 00:54:23,309
Are you free for dinner tonight?

432
00:54:32,309 --> 00:54:39,644
He wants to thank Your Majesty for
having attended the funeral ceremony.

433
00:54:39,644 --> 00:54:43,309
Welcome to Korea.

434
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:51,936
Thank you, Your Majesty.

435
00:54:53,309 --> 00:54:55,309
You're beautiful, Your Majesty.

436
00:54:55,309 --> 00:54:58,309
You're beautiful, Your Majesty.

437
00:55:01,309 --> 00:55:03,019
You're beautiful, Your Majesty.

438
00:55:11,309 --> 00:55:15,811
Here's your schedule for
tomorrow on Jeju Island.

439
00:55:23,309 --> 00:55:29,602
Yang Sooneui is now in Korea
as an interpreter for the envoys.

440
00:55:29,602 --> 00:55:33,309
That's what I heard, too.

441
00:55:33,309 --> 00:55:38,309
I wonder why memories don't fade with time.

442
00:55:38,309 --> 00:55:42,309
There are some things that
even time can't make you forget.

443
00:55:42,309 --> 00:55:46,393
In that case, you should
listen to your heart.

444
00:55:46,393 --> 00:55:48,727
Pardon?

445
00:55:48,727 --> 00:55:50,477
What happened?

446
00:55:50,477 --> 00:55:55,727
You always say, "You are
the future leader of this country."

447
00:55:55,727 --> 00:56:00,309
"Don't let your personal
feelings get in the way."

448
00:56:00,309 --> 00:56:04,852
You are the Crown Prince,
but you're also a person.

449
00:56:04,852 --> 00:56:09,309
You'll have a hard time persuading
the Empress Dowager,

450
00:56:09,309 --> 00:56:17,309
but I know a great way to persuade an adult.

451
00:56:17,309 --> 00:56:20,144
Lend me your ear.

452
00:56:26,519 --> 00:56:28,435
What?

453
00:56:28,435 --> 00:56:31,644
No way...

454
00:56:31,685 --> 00:56:36,309
I better get going now.

455
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:38,309
Lady Han!

456
00:56:53,228 --> 00:56:54,644
Welcome, Your Highness.

457
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:56,852
We thought you weren't coming until tomorrow.

458
00:56:56,852 --> 00:56:58,894
I'm just here to check out the place.

459
00:56:58,894 --> 00:57:01,309
Don't mind me.

460
00:57:01,309 --> 00:57:04,309
It's this way, right?

461
00:57:37,644 --> 00:57:43,393
Are you here to check out the
place for tomorrow's schedule?

462
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:45,309
Yes.

463
00:57:46,678 --> 00:57:49,383
Oh my!

464
00:57:50,769 --> 00:57:51,435
I'm sorry.

465
00:57:51,435 --> 00:57:54,144
It's broken.

466
00:57:54,144 --> 00:57:56,477
No, it's not.

467
00:57:56,519 --> 00:57:59,309
See?

468
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,560
What are you doing, Minsung?

469
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,309
Miss Shin!

470
00:58:25,393 --> 00:58:31,309
I never thought you'd work
for World Vision Korea.

471
00:58:31,309 --> 00:58:37,309
I'm more impressed you're Crown
Prince Julius's personal assistant.

472
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:45,685
It's good to see you again.

473
00:58:45,685 --> 00:58:47,309
Me, too.

474
00:58:47,309 --> 00:58:49,309
Really.

475
00:58:52,644 --> 00:58:55,309
You should've told me that you were coming.

476
00:58:55,309 --> 00:58:58,309
I almost missed you.

477
00:58:58,309 --> 00:59:00,685
Joon didn't call you?

478
00:59:00,685 --> 00:59:06,309
You call him by his name now?

479
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:09,685
You two seem to be very close, too.

480
00:59:09,685 --> 00:59:14,519
- I guess you can say that.
- You're right.

481
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:18,061
Why? Are you jealous?

482
00:59:18,061 --> 00:59:20,309
No.

483
00:59:27,228 --> 00:59:29,309
How long are you going to stay here?

484
00:59:31,644 --> 00:59:38,602
Do I have to speak formally to you
now because of diplomatic practice?

485
00:59:38,602 --> 00:59:43,560
I'm going back tomorrow after
the meeting, Your Highness.

486
00:59:43,602 --> 00:59:45,602
I see.

487
00:59:49,685 --> 00:59:53,309
I have to go.

488
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,309
Yang Sooneui!

489
01:00:07,727 --> 01:00:09,309
Are you okay?

490
01:00:09,309 --> 01:00:11,435
I'm okay.

491
01:00:32,144 --> 01:00:35,309
You've never been to the beach before?

492
01:00:35,309 --> 01:00:37,685
Why are you so happy?

493
01:00:37,685 --> 01:00:42,309
This is my first time. How pretty.

494
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:45,727
I'm going to come here for
my honeymoon in the future.

495
01:00:45,769 --> 01:00:47,977
I never asked you to marry me.

496
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:50,769
I'm not going to marry you.

497
01:00:50,769 --> 01:00:53,309
I already have someone else.

498
01:00:53,309 --> 01:00:54,309
What?

499
01:00:54,309 --> 01:00:55,936
Who is he?

500
01:00:55,936 --> 01:00:58,936
My secret buddy who gave me a teddy bear.

501
01:00:58,936 --> 01:01:02,309
I'm going to marry him.

502
01:01:11,685 --> 01:01:16,602
The performance will take place today and...
[Indie Band "Freedom" Concert]

503
01:01:18,309 --> 01:01:19,852
Do you know who that is?

504
01:01:19,852 --> 01:01:21,769
His Highness Prince Moonsung?

505
01:01:21,769 --> 01:01:24,309
He's living a double life.

506
01:01:24,309 --> 01:01:29,393
He's a Prince during the day,
and an indie songwriter at night.

507
01:01:31,309 --> 01:01:37,685
The only thing we don't like about
him is that he's always nagging Hoo.

508
01:01:37,685 --> 01:01:41,061
He's far worse than Lady Han.

509
01:01:43,309 --> 01:01:45,477
Do you know how to get there?

510
01:01:45,477 --> 01:01:46,310
Yes.

511
01:02:49,977 --> 01:02:57,102
I recently found out Grand
Duchess paid for my tuition.

512
01:02:57,102 --> 01:03:00,477
She must've felt guilty.

513
01:03:00,477 --> 01:03:04,144
She wanted to help when she heard

514
01:03:04,144 --> 01:03:12,309
Uncle Hyosung and Professor
Alex paid for your tuition.

515
01:03:12,309 --> 01:03:15,309
You must've been lonely there.

516
01:03:15,309 --> 01:03:17,309
I'm proud of you.

517
01:03:20,477 --> 01:03:23,019
Hoo was very lonely, too.

518
01:03:51,309 --> 01:04:00,309
I always wanted to know why you
tried so hard to get away from me.

519
01:04:00,309 --> 01:04:04,560
If I didn't, you wouldn't have let me go.

520
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,061
Fine.

521
01:04:06,061 --> 01:04:10,309
Let's not talk about how
many problems we'll face

522
01:04:10,309 --> 01:04:17,309
because I'm a royal and you're a commoner.

523
01:04:17,309 --> 01:04:22,811
I tried hard to get over you
for the last three years.

524
01:04:22,811 --> 01:04:31,894
I thought I was over you
until I saw you again.

525
01:04:31,894 --> 01:04:41,309
I realized I can't ever
hate you or get over you.

526
01:04:43,269 --> 01:04:48,644
Yang Sooneui, let's start over again.

527
01:04:52,477 --> 01:04:54,435
It's not that easy.

528
01:04:54,435 --> 01:04:57,309
You know that, too.

529
01:04:57,309 --> 01:04:58,644
Besides...

530
01:04:58,644 --> 01:05:01,477
Besides what?

531
01:05:01,477 --> 01:05:06,186
I like my job.

532
01:05:06,186 --> 01:05:12,309
I had a hard time getting used
to it, but I'm getting there.

533
01:05:14,309 --> 01:05:19,477
There are people who helped
me get to where I am.

534
01:05:19,477 --> 01:05:23,309
I want to do a good job.

535
01:07:32,309 --> 01:07:36,309
This is from Madam Chamberlain's office.

536
01:08:04,109 --> 01:08:05,694
How may I help you?

537
01:08:05,694 --> 01:08:11,569
I'm here with the new Madam Chamberlain.

538
01:08:11,569 --> 01:08:13,694
I see.

539
01:08:16,193 --> 01:08:18,944
Come in.

540
01:08:30,944 --> 01:08:34,319
Madam Chamberlain Yang
Sooneui studied in Europe.

541
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:38,611
She was the royal secretary for
the Helvetia Imperial Court

542
01:08:38,611 --> 01:08:45,694
before Her Majesty appointed
her to the palace.

543
01:08:52,277 --> 01:08:59,444
I was worried about you,
but you seem to be doing fine.

544
01:08:59,444 --> 01:09:04,611
You look like you belong here.

545
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:14,109
I thought hard about
what the right thing to do is,

546
01:09:14,109 --> 01:09:22,109
and decided to accept Her Majesty's offer.

547
01:09:22,109 --> 01:09:32,652
I'm still worried because I might bother you.

548
01:09:37,109 --> 01:09:39,109
Follow me.

549
01:09:39,109 --> 01:09:44,109
I have something to show to
a lady who's filled with worries.

550
01:10:33,109 --> 01:10:41,527
If you think about it,
this world is filled with worries.

551
01:10:41,527 --> 01:10:51,193
You can lose your job,
get sick, get hit by a car,

552
01:10:51,193 --> 01:10:57,277
and it might rain outside
after wearing new shoes.

553
01:10:57,319 --> 01:11:05,402
Maybe a nuclear war will make
the world come to an end.

554
01:11:05,402 --> 01:11:11,028
These dolls will take
most of your worries away.

555
01:11:11,028 --> 01:11:16,109
Yes, all but one.

556
01:11:16,109 --> 01:11:20,109
Being worried about losing love.

557
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:25,902
But, I think I've got that covered now.

558
01:11:25,902 --> 01:11:31,360
I learned something from Lady Han.

559
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:34,485
After all, we're adults.

560
01:12:08,673 --> 01:12:10,422
[Prince Hours]
