1
00:00:20,048 --> 00:00:23,167
Look at the target with your heart.

2
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:25,731
That way, you won't be bound by it.

3
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:43,248
Think that you and the bow are one.

4
00:00:55,082 --> 00:00:57,977
The arrow feels the wind
and moves accordingly.

5
00:00:57,977 --> 00:01:01,869
So, ultimately, you must overcome the wind.

6
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:34,142
[Prince Hours]

7
00:01:41,255 --> 00:01:42,627
Young Master!

8
00:01:52,927 --> 00:01:55,639
It's time to practice your boxing skills.

9
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:57,850
I need to go out for a minute.

10
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:01,987
You cannot take this competition lightly.

11
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,714
I know that. It won't take long.

12
00:02:07,535 --> 00:02:08,994
Young Master!

13
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,163
To me, this is just as
important as this competition.

14
00:02:17,422 --> 00:02:19,087
Attendant Yang...

15
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:25,115
will only hold you back.

16
00:02:25,115 --> 00:02:28,770
I know this is not the time to say this,

17
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,667
but if I become Crown Prince,

18
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:35,111
I'm going to choose my own woman.

19
00:02:37,706 --> 00:02:42,117
I'm going to become Crown Prince
so I can escape from my father.

20
00:02:44,305 --> 00:02:46,398
I won't be gone for long.

21
00:03:22,618 --> 00:03:24,164
You're going home?

22
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:26,424
Yes.

23
00:03:26,424 --> 00:03:29,246
Get in. I will give you a ride.

24
00:03:33,393 --> 00:03:36,933
Your Highness, do you have a minute?

25
00:03:47,313 --> 00:03:54,005
To be honest, all this time I really
didn't know what I was feeling.

26
00:03:55,817 --> 00:04:01,628
Or, I should say, I haven't
been honest with myself.

27
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:11,189
But, I finally figured things
out while I've been down here.

28
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:18,621
And, I feel I should let you know.

29
00:04:20,577 --> 00:04:22,618
I will go first.

30
00:04:22,618 --> 00:04:27,683
Prince Youngsung will marry someone
chosen by the Imperial Court.

31
00:04:27,683 --> 00:04:30,027
Since he grew up outside the palace,

32
00:04:30,027 --> 00:04:33,927
they'll choose someone
from a royal or noble family.

33
00:04:33,927 --> 00:04:37,599
I do not want or expect anything from him.

34
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:39,075
But...

35
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:48,504
I couldn't stop loving him all at once.

36
00:04:50,221 --> 00:04:52,361
- So...
- Then, stop it!

37
00:04:54,245 --> 00:04:56,172
Stop it right now!

38
00:04:56,172 --> 00:05:01,970
By the time I realized my true feelings,
I was already deeply into him.

39
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,486
I still am.

40
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:11,067
Right now, I'm trying to forget him.

41
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:13,542
And, maybe I will get over him with time.

42
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:18,421
I will wait with you.

43
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:19,997
Please don't!

44
00:05:19,997 --> 00:05:23,616
I wanted to talk to you to tell you this.

45
00:05:26,436 --> 00:05:29,700
Even if I forget Prince Youngsung,

46
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,160
I still can't accept the
feelings you have for me.

47
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:39,838
Being involved in one-sided love is

48
00:05:39,838 --> 00:05:43,488
more difficult and painful than I expected.

49
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,914
I don't want that for you either.

50
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:53,923
Find someone who will look at you eye to eye,

51
00:05:53,923 --> 00:05:56,441
and stand by your side.

52
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:00,807
Don't find someone who turns her back on you.

53
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:08,355
I wanted to tell you this.

54
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,587
I will walk you back to your place.

55
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:24,147
Even if I forget Prince Youngsung,

56
00:06:24,147 --> 00:06:28,768
I still can't accept the
feelings you have for me.

57
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:05,617
Prince Youngsung, it's time for
the martial arts competition.

58
00:07:27,492 --> 00:07:31,185
Prince Moonsung, it's time for
the martial arts competition.

59
00:08:15,273 --> 00:08:17,931
[Deuk Joong Pavilion]

60
00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:51,036
The first match of this competition is one
of the 24 martial arts skills, archery.

61
00:08:51,036 --> 00:08:54,597
Both Princes will each shoot three arrows.

62
00:08:54,597 --> 00:08:59,312
And, the person with the
highest score will win.

63
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:30,406
I want you two to have a
fair competition in good faith.

64
00:09:30,406 --> 00:09:35,839
Please do your best for the sake of
the Imperial Court's pride and honor!

65
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,617
Yes, Your Majesty!

66
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:41,176
You're obviously rooting for
Prince Youngsung, right?

67
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,576
Does it look like it?

68
00:09:44,576 --> 00:09:48,815
Your face brightened seeing him.

69
00:09:48,815 --> 00:09:52,450
I still hope Prince Moonsung will win.

70
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,881
I don't like the look on Joon's face.

71
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:16,959
I know. He looks worried.

72
00:10:24,762 --> 00:10:27,174
Did anything happen last night?

73
00:10:31,306 --> 00:10:33,082
Nothing happened.

74
00:10:33,082 --> 00:10:34,358
Really?

75
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:40,151
Right, there's no way he's
going to lose in archery.

76
00:12:50,372 --> 00:12:52,768
I am the bow.

77
00:12:53,867 --> 00:12:56,897
I am one with the bow.

78
00:13:25,911 --> 00:13:28,068
Right on target!

79
00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:27,593
What happened?

80
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:37,330
What were you thinking?

81
00:15:43,421 --> 00:15:45,276
Why can't you answer me?

82
00:15:46,638 --> 00:15:48,997
You've been doing archery
since you were a kid.

83
00:15:48,997 --> 00:15:51,765
How can you lose? How can I understand this?

84
00:15:52,373 --> 00:15:53,590
I am so sorry.

85
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,765
You began the competition with a defeat!

86
00:15:57,681 --> 00:16:00,632
You said you could win on your own.

87
00:16:00,632 --> 00:16:02,971
You'll never become Crown Prince if
you can't even beat someone like him!

88
00:16:02,971 --> 00:16:07,499
Joon must be in bad condition.

89
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:08,701
Please calm down.

90
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,437
How do you expect me to calm down?

91
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,802
He's like this because
you're always defending him!

92
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:17,666
Please don't be angry.

93
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:23,719
If you lose tomorrow's match, too,
we're going to do things my way!

94
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,882
Your Highness!

95
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,705
Please cheer up.

96
00:17:04,028 --> 00:17:08,168
I'm surprised you're worrying about me.

97
00:17:10,725 --> 00:17:12,553
You really meant it, right?

98
00:17:15,453 --> 00:17:16,498
Yes.

99
00:17:21,076 --> 00:17:23,464
I'm becoming more and more idiotic.

100
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,062
I told you I don't want to see you again.

101
00:18:09,062 --> 00:18:11,290
I had asked you to leave.

102
00:18:14,606 --> 00:18:18,562
I'm afraid I can no longer
follow your orders.

103
00:18:22,607 --> 00:18:25,538
You've changed a lot.

104
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,935
Before, you used to do anything I asked.

105
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:39,491
At one time, protecting you
was the only hope I had.

106
00:18:40,576 --> 00:18:44,217
But, not anymore.

107
00:18:46,422 --> 00:18:50,155
Why are you so faithful to Prince Youngsung?

108
00:18:50,155 --> 00:18:53,466
You only lived with him for 5 years,

109
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:56,773
and you're treating him as if he's
your own son. It bothers me.

110
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,626
I accepted him as my son in my heart
ever since his mother passed away.

111
00:19:08,008 --> 00:19:13,676
If I could, I will protect him with my life!

112
00:19:13,676 --> 00:19:15,980
Does that have anything
to do with his mother?

113
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,666
When I left the palace after we broke up,

114
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,295
I was lost for a long time.

115
00:19:24,532 --> 00:19:30,955
I didn't know what to do, or where to go.

116
00:19:30,955 --> 00:19:35,871
And, it was Prince Youngsung's
mother who encouraged me.

117
00:19:37,586 --> 00:19:43,358
Now, he is the hope of my life.

118
00:19:46,731 --> 00:19:48,254
Don't be like this.

119
00:19:50,034 --> 00:19:54,917
Please do as I say for old time's sake.

120
00:19:55,969 --> 00:19:57,981
Please, Sangki!

121
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:06,429
You said we were destined to meet.

122
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:17,957
Even if destiny allows us to meet again,
I will still stay by Prince Youngsung's side.

123
00:20:19,713 --> 00:20:22,693
Goodbye.

124
00:21:42,754 --> 00:21:45,046
Today's going to be another tough day.

125
00:21:52,538 --> 00:21:54,842
This is funny!

126
00:21:54,842 --> 00:21:56,947
My hair looks ridiculously funny!

127
00:21:56,947 --> 00:21:59,807
Even a strong wind wouldn't change that!

128
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:18,811
Today is another horrific competition day.

129
00:22:22,358 --> 00:22:26,567
Who do you think will win?

130
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:29,630
Let's bet $10, okay?

131
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:33,423
Eunuch Kwak! Where do you think you are?

132
00:22:33,423 --> 00:22:37,275
Would you please grow up?

133
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:41,974
Of course Prince Moonsung is going to win!

134
00:22:41,974 --> 00:22:43,575
He has so many years of experience.

135
00:22:43,575 --> 00:22:45,579
What?

136
00:22:46,942 --> 00:22:50,055
You wouldn't happen to have
any feelings for him, would you?

137
00:22:51,051 --> 00:22:54,378
How could you say something
like that in front of me?

138
00:22:55,436 --> 00:22:57,341
This is ridiculous!

139
00:22:57,341 --> 00:22:59,951
Are you hitting on me right now?

140
00:22:59,951 --> 00:23:02,647
Hitting on you?

141
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:03,796
Me?

142
00:23:05,224 --> 00:23:07,378
I have standards, too.

143
00:23:10,517 --> 00:23:12,386
Attendant Yang, how about
you? Want to bet $10?

144
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:35,205
Today's match will focus on
swordsmanship on horseback.

145
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:41,181
The two princes will each get three
chances while galloping on a horse.

146
00:23:42,198 --> 00:23:48,499
The person who makes the
most accurate blow will win.

147
00:23:53,574 --> 00:23:54,632
Giddy-yap!

148
00:24:09,107 --> 00:24:10,128
Hee-yah!

149
00:25:33,568 --> 00:25:36,756
Your Highness! Your Highness!

150
00:25:37,888 --> 00:25:39,659
I hope he's alright!

151
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:43,931
My God!

152
00:25:52,704 --> 00:25:53,892
Your Highness!

153
00:25:53,892 --> 00:25:56,471
I'm okay. I'm okay.

154
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:12,530
How can he fall off the horse?

155
00:26:14,463 --> 00:26:17,090
I have a bad feeling about this.

156
00:26:20,008 --> 00:26:23,674
But, I'm glad he wasn't hurt.

157
00:26:25,207 --> 00:26:28,038
My horse was acting really strange.

158
00:26:28,038 --> 00:26:30,862
He became started all of a sudden.

159
00:26:30,862 --> 00:26:33,227
But, he had nothing to be startled at.

160
00:26:34,855 --> 00:26:37,303
Startled?

161
00:26:37,303 --> 00:26:38,380
Yes.

162
00:26:39,183 --> 00:26:41,423
How strange.

163
00:26:41,423 --> 00:26:44,791
The horses of the Imperial Court
have all been specially trained.

164
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:48,089
They don't easily get startled.

165
00:26:48,678 --> 00:26:49,738
Really?

166
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,888
You didn't hurt yourself, did you?

167
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:06,167
I'm okay.

168
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:07,827
I'm glad.

169
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,084
You were out of luck today.

170
00:27:11,084 --> 00:27:14,599
But, there's still one more match.
So, don't be too disappointed.

171
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:15,828
Thank you.

172
00:27:17,824 --> 00:27:21,837
Take good care of him
with your martial arts skills.

173
00:27:23,215 --> 00:27:25,020
Yes, Your Highness.

174
00:27:30,847 --> 00:27:35,205
Then, have a good rest. Don't overdo it.

175
00:27:35,205 --> 00:27:36,193
Yes, sir.

176
00:27:37,214 --> 00:27:38,321
Then...

177
00:27:48,407 --> 00:27:51,251
So, tell me about the whistle.

178
00:28:00,718 --> 00:28:06,623
Humans cannot hear this
whistle, but horses can.

179
00:28:06,623 --> 00:28:10,896
It was used in wars in the old days
to distract the enemy's horses.

180
00:28:10,896 --> 00:28:12,941
Great job!

181
00:28:14,089 --> 00:28:18,228
We almost lost without even
making it to the third match.

182
00:28:19,962 --> 00:28:22,074
How are things going
with tailing Her Majesty?

183
00:28:22,074 --> 00:28:24,502
It's going as instructed.

184
00:28:25,185 --> 00:28:28,434
Okay. Be cautious.

185
00:28:28,434 --> 00:28:31,574
Be very cautious.

186
00:28:31,574 --> 00:28:35,597
We must find out what she's up to this time.

187
00:28:35,597 --> 00:28:37,749
Don't make any mistakes.

188
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:40,017
Yes, my lord.

189
00:28:58,886 --> 00:29:02,813
Prince Moonsung has a strong right leg.

190
00:29:02,813 --> 00:29:06,056
Watch out for his right
foot during the match.

191
00:29:08,261 --> 00:29:11,334
The most important key
in formulating a tactic

192
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:14,865
is to grasp your opponent's weakness.

193
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:19,373
When you know your opponent's weakness,

194
00:29:19,373 --> 00:29:22,730
you'll be able to counterattack very easily.

195
00:29:23,933 --> 00:29:27,941
You can use that to your advantage.

196
00:29:42,985 --> 00:29:44,374
Your Highness!

197
00:29:45,921 --> 00:29:49,566
This is the uniform you'll be
wearing for tomorrow's match.

198
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:54,333
Okay, thank you.

199
00:29:59,362 --> 00:30:02,495
I will leave it in your room.

200
00:30:09,097 --> 00:30:10,671
Have been well?

201
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:22,059
Yes, thanks to you.

202
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:26,725
The air here is really nice,
and the workload is light.

203
00:30:26,725 --> 00:30:29,562
But, you don't look like
you've been doing well.

204
00:30:30,975 --> 00:30:32,578
You've lost weight.

205
00:30:41,462 --> 00:30:42,595
Oh!

206
00:30:47,351 --> 00:30:48,877
It's been a long time.

207
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:53,202
Yes, Attendant Yang. We meet again.

208
00:30:54,342 --> 00:30:57,931
I was sad because you left so suddenly.

209
00:30:58,911 --> 00:31:02,359
Oh, how did the entrance exam go?

210
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:04,834
You took the exam not too long ago, right?

211
00:31:08,822 --> 00:31:11,618
Did I say something I shouldn't have?

212
00:31:13,032 --> 00:31:14,411
No, it's fine.

213
00:31:38,016 --> 00:31:39,599
Your Highness!

214
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:41,829
Let's go to Jang Boon Gate now.

215
00:32:05,103 --> 00:32:06,811
That girl is...

216
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:13,419
She's the daughter of Prime Minister Shin.

217
00:32:20,122 --> 00:32:24,171
Strangely, I feel so calm
when I'm in a place like this.

218
00:32:24,171 --> 00:32:28,468
I'm no longer surrounded by grand buildings.

219
00:32:28,468 --> 00:32:33,187
Now, there's only serenity, a blowing wind,

220
00:32:33,187 --> 00:32:35,671
and memories of the past.

221
00:32:36,531 --> 00:32:41,415
When I'm in a place like this, I feel peace.

222
00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:46,328
Maybe it's because of the solitude.

223
00:32:49,228 --> 00:32:51,028
What's wrong?

224
00:32:51,028 --> 00:32:53,879
You find it strange that I'm saying this?

225
00:32:54,947 --> 00:32:56,187
No.

226
00:32:57,126 --> 00:33:02,266
Although it's a bit unexpected,
I think that suits you better.

227
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:14,722
You're always smiling,
but I sense loneliness in you.

228
00:33:27,293 --> 00:33:32,043
I was often like that, too, since
I lived with my mother alone.

229
00:33:34,101 --> 00:33:43,452
Sometimes you have the same
expression I had when I was younger.

230
00:33:47,112 --> 00:33:54,772
My parents were always busy with
their work, and I was always alone.

231
00:33:57,928 --> 00:33:59,445
This is embarrassing.

232
00:34:01,057 --> 00:34:04,853
I've never told this to anyone before.

233
00:34:07,889 --> 00:34:13,680
Being all alone, having
no one else around you,

234
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:17,842
is something really difficult to bear.

235
00:34:17,842 --> 00:34:18,942
Yes, it is!

236
00:34:26,866 --> 00:34:33,470
There were times when I thought I'd
rather die than live such a lonely life.

237
00:34:53,441 --> 00:34:54,619
Empress?

238
00:34:55,935 --> 00:34:57,531
Yes, Mother?

239
00:34:58,464 --> 00:35:00,200
It's nothing.

240
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,628
Never mind.

241
00:35:02,552 --> 00:35:05,156
That's not possible.

242
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,955
What is?

243
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:12,815
You see...

244
00:35:14,842 --> 00:35:20,362
I think there's something going on between
Prince Youngsung and Saeryung.

245
00:35:20,362 --> 00:35:21,440
Pardon?

246
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,471
What I'm saying is...

247
00:35:25,471 --> 00:35:27,289
the two of them...

248
00:35:27,289 --> 00:35:28,753
I doubt it.

249
00:35:28,753 --> 00:35:31,659
She almost got engaged to Prince Moonsung.

250
00:35:31,659 --> 00:35:33,536
That's what I'm saying.

251
00:35:35,068 --> 00:35:42,557
I want Prince Youngsung to marry
someone from a noble family.

252
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,960
We can't let him go through the same
things his parents went through.

253
00:35:51,299 --> 00:35:54,544
[Prince Hours]

254
00:35:56,987 --> 00:36:00,065
I'm worried about this.

255
00:36:01,341 --> 00:36:03,878
It's hard for me, too.

256
00:36:03,878 --> 00:36:08,705
But, if I don't do this, I can't meet him.

257
00:37:12,916 --> 00:37:15,962
- You're done for the day?
- Yes, good night.

258
00:37:43,977 --> 00:37:46,326
I was waiting for you to get off work.

259
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:50,317
Just for tonight, let's go
back to being friends.

260
00:37:54,802 --> 00:37:56,805
You left something very important behind.

261
00:37:58,761 --> 00:38:01,666
I have one more, so don't worry.

262
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:06,332
And, I left it there on purpose.

263
00:38:06,332 --> 00:38:08,614
You looked like you had many worries.

264
00:38:10,027 --> 00:38:12,370
You should keep it.

265
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,743
Otherwise, your secret admirer will be upset.

266
00:38:23,226 --> 00:38:25,687
Is this why you came to see me?

267
00:38:25,687 --> 00:38:27,412
And, I have something I want to ask you.

268
00:38:30,384 --> 00:38:35,551
What's going to happen to your
dream now that you're down here?

269
00:38:36,972 --> 00:38:40,897
This happened because of me, and I feel bad.

270
00:38:40,897 --> 00:38:44,033
Don't be. It was your ring to begin with.

271
00:38:44,033 --> 00:38:48,654
Your losing such a valuable ring
because of me is unacceptable!

272
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:56,117
I don't regret coming down here.

273
00:38:58,498 --> 00:39:00,967
Let's go back.

274
00:39:00,967 --> 00:39:02,771
I can help you.

275
00:39:04,431 --> 00:39:07,848
This is the path I've chosen to take.
I'll take the consequences.

276
00:39:56,745 --> 00:40:02,001
Oh, my! I think those people are
taking pictures of Her Majesty!

277
00:40:02,001 --> 00:40:02,973
What?

278
00:40:03,728 --> 00:40:05,756
What do we do?

279
00:40:05,756 --> 00:40:07,488
We have to stop them. Hurry!

280
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:08,532
Okay!

281
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:13,549
Your Majesty!

282
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:20,007
Who are you men?

283
00:40:20,007 --> 00:40:21,635
What are you doing with a camera?

284
00:40:33,208 --> 00:40:34,299
Stop!

285
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:41,338
What happened?

286
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:43,644
Your Majesty, are you alright?

287
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:46,428
What's going on?

288
00:40:47,656 --> 00:40:50,842
Some people were taking
pictures of Your Majesty.

289
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,746
What did you say?

290
00:40:54,509 --> 00:40:57,893
Prince Youngsung went chasing after them.

291
00:40:57,893 --> 00:40:59,325
Prince Youngsung?

292
00:40:59,325 --> 00:41:02,004
Your Majesty, you must leave now.

293
00:41:02,004 --> 00:41:04,207
People will crowd around you soon.

294
00:41:07,955 --> 00:41:09,642
Then, what about Alex?

295
00:41:10,691 --> 00:41:15,678
I'm a court lady here, so I'm
very familiar with the area.

296
00:41:15,678 --> 00:41:19,400
I'll lead him outside unnoticed.

297
00:41:20,892 --> 00:41:22,640
Can I trust you?

298
00:41:23,843 --> 00:41:26,225
Please don't worry, Your Majesty.

299
00:41:26,225 --> 00:41:27,965
You must hurry!

300
00:41:30,941 --> 00:41:32,600
This way!

301
00:41:43,928 --> 00:41:45,421
Please come.

302
00:41:49,711 --> 00:41:52,348
Your Majesty, you must hurry.

303
00:42:24,069 --> 00:42:25,716
Who are you?

304
00:42:25,716 --> 00:42:27,944
How dare you take pictures inside the palace?

305
00:42:58,762 --> 00:43:00,112
Are you okay?

306
00:43:15,522 --> 00:43:18,698
I owe you again.

307
00:43:18,698 --> 00:43:20,727
Please don't mention it, Your Majesty.

308
00:43:21,593 --> 00:43:29,489
Alex is my friend and boyfriend
whom I met while studying in England.

309
00:43:31,548 --> 00:43:35,713
I met him when I was really
worn out from living abroad.

310
00:43:36,588 --> 00:43:41,713
Although I was an Empress,
I was living a very lonely life.

311
00:43:41,713 --> 00:43:44,076
And, that's when I met him.

312
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:52,523
He's half-Korean, so we
connected immediately.

313
00:43:52,523 --> 00:43:56,605
And, then we became very close

314
00:43:56,605 --> 00:43:59,472
when we went to Africa
together to do voluntary work.

315
00:43:59,472 --> 00:44:02,708
What do you plan to do now?

316
00:44:03,152 --> 00:44:05,114
To be honest,

317
00:44:06,806 --> 00:44:10,404
I don't know.

318
00:44:12,437 --> 00:44:18,401
Even an elementary school student
would know I can't marry him.

319
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:25,526
But, I can't break up with
him right away either.

320
00:44:26,969 --> 00:44:30,397
My heart won't allow it.

321
00:44:32,889 --> 00:44:35,444
There wasn't a day

322
00:44:35,444 --> 00:44:40,272
I didn't think about him in the past 7 years.

323
00:44:43,693 --> 00:44:45,816
You think you can understand me?

324
00:44:49,708 --> 00:44:51,484
It's very difficult.

325
00:44:51,484 --> 00:44:55,456
Yes, it seems that's the
correct answer for now.

326
00:44:58,187 --> 00:45:04,691
You have a rough road ahead of you
in competing to become Crown Prince.

327
00:45:04,691 --> 00:45:07,719
And, I will have my difficult days as well.

328
00:45:09,714 --> 00:45:18,415
I hope you'll look to me as I do to you...
no matter what kind of decision I make.

329
00:45:19,051 --> 00:45:24,039
Don't worry. I will help you no matter what.

330
00:45:26,219 --> 00:45:27,502
Your Majesty.

331
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:33,136
The palace attendant you
met earlier has arrived.

332
00:45:39,005 --> 00:45:40,952
Attendant, come in.

333
00:45:47,981 --> 00:45:49,263
Sit down.

334
00:45:58,997 --> 00:46:01,139
Did he get out safely?

335
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:02,876
Yes, Your Majesty!

336
00:46:02,876 --> 00:46:08,604
I chose a rarely used route
and escorted him out of the palace.

337
00:46:08,604 --> 00:46:13,798
I returned after I saw him getting in a cab.

338
00:46:13,798 --> 00:46:16,346
You've helped me greatly today.

339
00:46:18,015 --> 00:46:20,483
I am honored, Your Majesty!

340
00:46:36,625 --> 00:46:39,396
We missed out on a great opportunity!

341
00:46:42,585 --> 00:46:44,132
Forgive me.

342
00:46:49,501 --> 00:46:52,847
The Empress's lover?

343
00:46:52,847 --> 00:46:58,774
Ah, this should be an interesting game.

344
00:47:14,502 --> 00:47:19,161
I've never seen these many
stars since I was a child.

345
00:47:20,245 --> 00:47:22,442
That's why I like this place.

346
00:47:31,774 --> 00:47:34,842
Are you confident about tomorrow's match?

347
00:47:36,897 --> 00:47:38,717
I'll have to try my best.

348
00:47:41,522 --> 00:47:44,679
You will do well! You will!

349
00:47:46,483 --> 00:47:51,974
I told you. You have more than what
it takes to become Crown Prince.

350
00:47:51,974 --> 00:47:56,467
I bet you'll become the
coolest Crown Prince ever!

351
00:48:04,478 --> 00:48:05,938
Yang Sooneui...

352
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:15,486
Did you leave the palace
because of Prince Moonsung?

353
00:48:18,666 --> 00:48:20,490
No.

354
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:22,521
Then, come back.

355
00:48:22,521 --> 00:48:24,894
You can get your old job back.

356
00:48:26,705 --> 00:48:28,666
I don't want to.

357
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:29,757
Why not?

358
00:48:34,409 --> 00:48:38,679
I don't want to be of your service anymore.

359
00:48:38,679 --> 00:48:42,668
And, I don't want to be hurt by you.

360
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:46,380
Living here is free from care.

361
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,007
I know you're lying.

362
00:48:50,068 --> 00:48:52,574
I don't know why you left,

363
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:57,701
but this all happened because of me,
and I should take responsibility.

364
00:48:58,945 --> 00:49:01,162
Kang Hoo.

365
00:49:01,162 --> 00:49:05,522
From now on, you need to
look after the Imperial Palace

366
00:49:05,522 --> 00:49:08,366
and the people of this country, not me.

367
00:49:10,313 --> 00:49:12,529
Don't ever forget that.

368
00:49:12,529 --> 00:49:15,085
You're the future Crown Prince!

369
00:49:22,657 --> 00:49:25,222
Thank you for caring about me.

370
00:49:26,186 --> 00:49:29,110
But, for now, just leave me alone.

371
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:34,610
That's... helping me.

372
00:49:37,336 --> 00:49:38,611
Bye.

373
00:50:21,798 --> 00:50:24,986
Oh my! You scared me!

374
00:50:24,986 --> 00:50:27,149
You still haven't left yet?

375
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:29,994
I thought you went home earlier.

376
00:50:29,994 --> 00:50:32,049
I just dropped by for a second.

377
00:50:32,049 --> 00:50:33,750
I should be going now.

378
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,804
What's wrong?

379
00:51:52,607 --> 00:51:54,236
Are you okay, Your Highness?

380
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:58,172
Yes. It's nothing.

381
00:52:05,374 --> 00:52:06,602
Your Highness!

382
00:52:08,646 --> 00:52:10,402
What's going on?

383
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:20,689
Please sit down.

384
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:28,246
I treated you with a
temporary solution last time.

385
00:52:28,246 --> 00:52:30,395
Now, the energy flow is
completely off balance.

386
00:52:30,395 --> 00:52:32,438
That's why you're having pain.

387
00:52:33,808 --> 00:52:36,634
This is why I told you to be very careful.

388
00:52:36,634 --> 00:52:40,920
You rushed things and it's caused trouble.

389
00:53:16,006 --> 00:53:20,727
Both princes look dignified, don't they?

390
00:53:20,727 --> 00:53:22,250
They certainly do.

391
00:53:23,511 --> 00:53:29,421
Prince Moonsung's martial arts
skills are excellent as people say.

392
00:53:29,421 --> 00:53:31,989
I am honored.

393
00:53:31,989 --> 00:53:36,042
Prince Youngsung also has great skills.

394
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:38,302
That's true.

395
00:53:38,302 --> 00:53:42,909
Who would've thought he would make
such quick progress in such a short time?

396
00:53:42,909 --> 00:53:45,454
But, when you learn things in a crash course,

397
00:53:45,454 --> 00:53:47,963
there's always a blind spot.

398
00:53:49,653 --> 00:53:53,730
We won't know who will
win till it's all over.

399
00:55:22,821 --> 00:55:24,144
Prince Youngsung!

400
00:55:24,144 --> 00:55:27,033
- Oh my!
- Oh no!

401
00:56:07,881 --> 00:56:10,121
After a fair judgment,

402
00:56:10,121 --> 00:56:13,088
the final winner of this
martial arts competition is

403
00:56:13,088 --> 00:56:15,676
Prince Moonsung.

404
00:57:01,239 --> 00:57:05,442
You were able to beat your
own nature in this tournament.

405
00:57:05,442 --> 00:57:07,894
And, you did your best until the end.

406
00:57:10,562 --> 00:57:12,638
But, I still lost.

407
00:57:14,274 --> 00:57:17,290
Don't focus on the immediate win or loss.

408
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:19,390
Look at the bigger picture.

409
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:57,572
What are you doing here?

410
00:58:01,318 --> 00:58:04,935
I came because I'm leaving tomorrow.

411
00:58:07,411 --> 00:58:10,888
Yang Sooneui, I'm asking you one last time.

412
00:58:11,731 --> 00:58:13,908
Let's go back to Seoul together.

413
00:58:13,908 --> 00:58:17,716
Go to Seoul and enter the Academy.

414
00:58:17,716 --> 00:58:19,993
Make your dream come true!

415
00:58:38,629 --> 00:58:40,450
Where is Prince Youngsung?

416
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:42,607
He stepped out for a minute.

417
00:58:45,289 --> 00:58:46,500
Really?

418
00:58:52,705 --> 00:58:54,390
Why not?

419
00:58:57,098 --> 00:59:01,371
I just... need some time.

420
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,686
Time for what?

421
00:59:05,018 --> 00:59:08,175
I need time to sort things out.

422
00:59:09,266 --> 00:59:15,286
I'll go back after some time has passed.

423
00:59:16,281 --> 00:59:20,318
I don't understand why you won't come back.

424
00:59:24,722 --> 00:59:28,181
You'll never understand in your lifetime.

425
00:59:28,181 --> 00:59:29,896
What?

426
00:59:29,896 --> 00:59:32,120
There must be a reason!

427
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,334
Give me a reason that I can believe.

428
00:59:34,334 --> 00:59:35,984
Then, I'll give up asking.

429
00:59:36,638 --> 00:59:38,244
We got the ring back,

430
00:59:38,244 --> 00:59:40,570
so it's not like you have to
worry about Joon's mother.

431
00:59:42,189 --> 00:59:45,774
Perhaps one day I can tell you why.

432
00:59:45,774 --> 00:59:47,438
But, for now, just leave.

433
00:59:47,438 --> 00:59:49,578
Why are you giving up your dream?

434
00:59:50,431 --> 00:59:53,860
If you miss this chance, you'll
have to wait another year.

435
00:59:54,705 --> 00:59:56,063
Goodbye.

436
00:59:59,257 --> 01:00:00,510
Tell me!

437
01:00:01,394 --> 01:00:05,255
If you leave like this, I'll feel bad.

438
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:11,452
Kang Hoo... this is really hard for me.

439
01:00:11,452 --> 01:00:15,210
So, please leave me alone!

440
01:00:15,701 --> 01:00:17,945
Why? What's hard for you?

441
01:00:20,292 --> 01:00:23,914
I don't want to see you suffer.

442
01:00:25,382 --> 01:00:28,912
Tell me! I'll help you!

443
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,677
This isn't something you can help me with.

444
01:00:33,677 --> 01:00:35,493
You can't help me!

445
01:00:35,493 --> 01:00:36,996
Why not?

446
01:00:36,996 --> 01:00:38,453
It's all because of you!

447
01:00:38,453 --> 01:00:40,512
Just looking at you is hard for me!

448
01:00:43,492 --> 01:00:45,556
Are you happy now?

449
01:00:45,556 --> 01:00:47,785
Did you have to grill me like that?

450
01:00:49,541 --> 01:00:53,476
Hearing your voice, seeing
your face, and thinking of you...

451
01:00:53,476 --> 01:00:55,553
is really hard for me.

452
01:00:58,844 --> 01:01:02,449
So, please leave me alone!

453
01:01:04,556 --> 01:01:06,348
I'm sorry.

454
01:01:06,348 --> 01:01:08,589
I'm sorry I made you suffer.

455
01:01:08,589 --> 01:01:10,858
And, I'm sorry I didn't
realize your feelings.

456
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:14,881
And, I'm sorry I can't make
any promises to you.

457
01:01:16,053 --> 01:01:17,435
But, I...

458
01:01:21,221 --> 01:01:26,090
I wish you'd always be by my side.

459
01:02:11,445 --> 01:02:13,538
Thank you for your trouble.

460
01:02:13,538 --> 01:02:16,359
Have a safe trip, Your Majesty.

461
01:02:17,682 --> 01:02:19,167
Let's go.

462
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:54,429
Madam Chamberlain!
You still haven't left yet?

463
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:15,634
Her Majesty sent me to see you.

464
01:03:15,634 --> 01:03:18,143
What? Her Majesty?

465
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:21,770
As you've witnessed,

466
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:27,027
Her Majesty is always surrounded
by people who want to harm her.

467
01:03:28,735 --> 01:03:35,181
Not all the palace court
ladies are on her side.

468
01:03:35,181 --> 01:03:37,093
I don't quite follow you.

469
01:03:37,093 --> 01:03:44,405
Her Majesty was deeply
impressed by your goodness.

470
01:03:44,405 --> 01:03:49,497
So, she wants you to work as
a royal escort in the future.

471
01:03:50,677 --> 01:03:52,625
A royal escort?

472
01:03:56,558 --> 01:04:02,377
But, I'm not qualified to become one.

473
01:04:03,845 --> 01:04:06,860
In order to become a royal escort,

474
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:11,260
I must graduate from the Royal Academy.

475
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:16,144
So, Her Majesty has issued a special order.

476
01:04:24,939 --> 01:04:28,438
Your Highness. Do you remember asking
me to look into your mother's case?

477
01:04:28,438 --> 01:04:31,106
I found something out.

478
01:04:32,693 --> 01:04:38,071
I think you were right.

479
01:04:38,071 --> 01:04:43,539
I think your mother was framed.

480
01:04:45,815 --> 01:04:49,510
The more I look into this case,
the more suspicious I get.

481
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:50,702
Like what?

482
01:04:50,702 --> 01:04:52,526
There was not enough proof,

483
01:04:52,526 --> 01:04:55,213
and the case was closed too quickly.

484
01:04:55,213 --> 01:04:59,676
What really bothers me is the case
was only based on one testimony.

485
01:04:59,676 --> 01:05:00,976
Whose testimony?

486
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:06,493
He was the director of the
foundation at the time.

487
01:05:06,493 --> 01:05:07,830
If we find this person,

488
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:10,121
then perhaps many of our questions
will be answered.

489
01:05:34,308 --> 01:05:37,053
Then, I'll be in touch again.

490
01:05:37,853 --> 01:05:39,281
Have a safe trip.

491
01:06:12,477 --> 01:06:13,777
Yang Sooneui!
