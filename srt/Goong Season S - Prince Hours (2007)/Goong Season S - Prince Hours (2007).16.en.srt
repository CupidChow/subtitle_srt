[Imperial Court Records of Korea / 1988]

3
00:00:59,162 --> 00:01:03,162
Prince Youngsung, what are you doing here?

4
00:01:03,162 --> 00:01:07,162
Even a Prince is not allowed in here!

5
00:01:07,162 --> 00:01:17,955
I just... placed my access card here out
of curiosity, and the door just opened.

6
00:01:17,955 --> 00:01:22,162
I see.

7
00:01:22,162 --> 00:01:26,162
What were you looking at?

8
00:01:26,162 --> 00:01:27,580
Well...

9
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,162
Bring it to me.

10
00:01:29,162 --> 00:01:32,497
Yes, Your Highness.

11
00:01:57,538 --> 00:02:01,580
What were you reading in here?

12
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,081
Uh...

13
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:06,039
Your Highness, the Prince was
reading letters exchanged

14
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:13,162
between our late Emperors
and monarchs from other nations.

15
00:02:13,162 --> 00:02:18,413
How did you know there were letters in here?

16
00:02:18,413 --> 00:02:23,162
I told him, Your Highness.

17
00:02:23,162 --> 00:02:25,413
You did?

18
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:28,162
Yes, Your Highness.

19
00:02:28,162 --> 00:02:30,872
I thought the documents pertaining to

20
00:02:30,872 --> 00:02:38,162
his regency were too difficult
for him to understand.

21
00:02:38,162 --> 00:02:45,162
So, I told him to start
by reading the letters.

22
00:02:45,162 --> 00:02:51,122
This is my fault. Please punish me instead.

23
00:02:51,122 --> 00:02:54,162
How could you be so thoughtless?

24
00:02:54,162 --> 00:02:59,455
This is so unlike you!

25
00:02:59,455 --> 00:03:03,162
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

26
00:03:03,162 --> 00:03:09,162
Prince Youngsung, is Madam Chamberlain right?

27
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:18,162
Yes.

28
00:03:18,162 --> 00:03:23,538
I will get back to you later to
punish you on this issue.

29
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:26,162
Yes, Your Highness.

30
00:03:26,162 --> 00:03:29,747
You should leave this place at once.

31
00:03:31,246 --> 00:03:33,162
Okay.

32
00:03:54,246 --> 00:03:58,162
Thank you, Madam Chamberlain.

33
00:03:58,162 --> 00:04:04,955
Your Highness, you really
shouldn't have done that.

34
00:04:04,955 --> 00:04:09,162
Did you read the Imperial Court Records?

35
00:04:09,162 --> 00:04:12,081
Yes, I did.

36
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:18,162
Your authority to assist
as a Regent is limited.

37
00:04:18,162 --> 00:04:23,330
Reading the Records means
you crossed the line.

38
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,372
This may get out of hand if others find out.

39
00:04:27,372 --> 00:04:33,162
You must keep this a secret.

40
00:04:33,162 --> 00:04:36,162
Please keep this in mind.

41
00:04:38,162 --> 00:04:40,162
Okay.

42
00:04:46,372 --> 00:04:49,538
I have something important to tell you.

43
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:53,914
Yes, it's important.

44
00:04:53,914 --> 00:04:57,330
Please relay this message to Grand Prince.

45
00:05:00,413 --> 00:05:07,330
That immature rabbit has made great trouble.

46
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,997
How dare he read the Imperial Court Records!

47
00:05:11,997 --> 00:05:14,497
Now, he must pay the price.

48
00:05:15,162 --> 00:05:18,664
What happened?

49
00:05:22,246 --> 00:05:26,455
I can't trust anyone anymore...

50
00:05:26,455 --> 00:05:28,538
Not Her Majesty...

51
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:32,162
Not the Empress Dowager...

52
00:05:32,162 --> 00:05:37,162
Not even my mom...

53
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:40,162
I can't trust anyone anymore...

54
00:06:22,497 --> 00:06:26,872
You must first read the diplomatic documents

55
00:06:26,872 --> 00:06:30,162
that require Her Majesty's approval.

56
00:06:30,162 --> 00:06:39,288
Next, read the special reports from the
cabinet and examine the legislative bills.

57
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:52,162
I only selected the reports
and petitions you must read.

58
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,162
There's a lot of work to be done.

59
00:06:56,162 --> 00:07:00,162
This is what Her Majesty does everyday.

60
00:07:00,162 --> 00:07:07,162
The Empress Dowager will make the final
decision after you two examine them.

61
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:12,162
Her Highness the Empress Dowager is here.

62
00:07:29,162 --> 00:07:33,162
I've been acting as a regent on
my own for the last two years

63
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:37,246
after Crown Prince Hwemin passed away.

64
00:07:37,246 --> 00:07:43,580
I'm pleased to see you two together here.

65
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,455
The monarch needs to keep everyone balanced.

66
00:07:48,455 --> 00:07:55,664
You must not make decisions
based on one standard.

67
00:07:55,664 --> 00:08:03,162
Wisdom is finding the path for
ten people with one truth.

68
00:08:03,162 --> 00:08:09,162
I hope this assignment will help you
realize the real meaning of wisdom.

69
00:08:09,162 --> 00:08:13,162
I'll keep that in mind, Your Highness.

70
00:08:23,163 --> 00:08:29,162
Since they're still not used to this,
assist them well, Madam Chamberlain.

71
00:08:29,162 --> 00:08:32,162
I will, Your Highness.

72
00:08:32,162 --> 00:08:33,997
Your Highness.

73
00:08:33,997 --> 00:08:37,955
I have something important to tell you.

74
00:08:37,955 --> 00:08:41,538
Forgive me, but an anonymous letter
was sent by the court ladies' office

75
00:08:41,538 --> 00:08:45,162
to the Royal Investigative Commission
about misconduct from palace eunuchs' office.

76
00:08:45,162 --> 00:08:51,122
When the palace eunuchs heard about this,
they had strife with the court ladies.

77
00:08:51,122 --> 00:08:53,162
An anonymous letter?

78
00:08:53,162 --> 00:08:55,872
What do you mean?

79
00:08:55,872 --> 00:08:57,664
Birds of a feather flock together.

80
00:08:57,664 --> 00:09:00,163
We've been working together for a long time,

81
00:09:00,163 --> 00:09:06,538
but palace eunuchs and palace
attendants are two different groups.

82
00:09:06,538 --> 00:09:08,162
How disturbing.

83
00:09:08,162 --> 00:09:10,162
It's okay.

84
00:09:10,162 --> 00:09:14,789
We should teach those
palace eunuchs a lesson.

85
00:09:17,162 --> 00:09:18,039
The representatives from

86
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:23,246
the court ladies' office and palace eunuchs'
office will talk to the two Princes tomorrow.

87
00:09:23,246 --> 00:09:29,872
They'll be so dead once we
find proof of their illegal acts.

88
00:09:36,162 --> 00:09:38,705
The Investigative Commission is
investigating this matter vigorously to see

89
00:09:38,705 --> 00:09:41,497
if the letter is true or not.

90
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,162
We will soon find out the truth behind this.

91
00:09:44,162 --> 00:09:53,162
I called you two here to talk about
something unrelated to the letter.

92
00:09:55,205 --> 00:09:58,162
We've realized there has been much conflict

93
00:09:58,162 --> 00:10:01,039
between the court ladies' office
and the palace eunuchs' office.

94
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:05,246
I think most of the problems are
because of different points of view.

95
00:10:05,246 --> 00:10:06,747
The court ladies are dissatisfied with

96
00:10:06,747 --> 00:10:10,122
how arbitrarily the palace
eunuchs make decisions,

97
00:10:10,122 --> 00:10:13,538
and the palace eunuchs think
the court ladies are uncooperative.

98
00:10:13,538 --> 00:10:16,747
I'd like to make a proposal.

99
00:10:16,747 --> 00:10:21,162
Walk in the other person's shoes.

100
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:27,162
Why don't the palace eunuchs and the court
ladies switch their duties for a day?

101
00:10:28,288 --> 00:10:32,789
Your Highness, but what for?

102
00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:37,955
Distrust can come from
misunderstanding the other person.

103
00:10:37,955 --> 00:10:39,162
If you put yourself in
the other person's shoes,

104
00:10:39,162 --> 00:10:42,497
it'll help you understand each other.

105
00:10:42,497 --> 00:10:46,162
With understanding, naturally
you'll have less misunderstanding.

106
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:49,330
That'll help you work efficiently.

107
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,705
What do you think?

108
00:10:58,162 --> 00:10:59,789
What?

109
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:02,081
Prince Youngsung wanted the court ladies

110
00:11:02,081 --> 00:11:04,372
and the palace eunuchs to
switch their duties?

111
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:08,830
I've never heard of something so absurd while
working as a palace eunuch for 10 years.

112
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,162
Absurd?

113
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,664
How dare you say something so disloyal!

114
00:11:16,664 --> 00:11:26,372
Don't you know the Prince's orders are Her
Majesty's orders during the regency period?

115
00:11:26,372 --> 00:11:28,372
I've committed a grave error!

116
00:11:32,747 --> 00:11:39,579
Regardless of whether you like his order,
we must follow it without complaints!

117
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:41,010
Understand?

118
00:11:41,538 --> 00:11:43,246
Yes, Lady Han.

119
00:11:48,162 --> 00:11:50,039
After 10 years of working
as a palace attendant...

120
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:54,162
I mean, a palace eunuch,
I have to sew buttons.

121
00:11:54,162 --> 00:11:57,330
Why don't you just call me Attendant
Kwak instead of Eunuch Kwak?

122
00:11:57,741 --> 00:12:00,039
Ahh! Ow!

123
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,162
Are you okay?

124
00:12:01,162 --> 00:12:03,330
I'm bleeding!

125
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:06,109
Ergh!

126
00:12:18,065 --> 00:12:20,455
- Geez, I feel so free!
- Be careful.

127
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:23,720
- Whoa, whoa...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...

128
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,220
Hold it carefully.

129
00:12:25,195 --> 00:12:26,991
Ow! So hot!

130
00:12:35,163 --> 00:12:40,413
Your Highness, nothing's working
out right inside the palace.

131
00:12:40,413 --> 00:12:45,580
I hope this doesn't lead to more mishaps.

132
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,747
Please reconsider.

133
00:12:49,747 --> 00:12:53,162
Listen, you two.

134
00:12:53,162 --> 00:12:58,162
I, too, have been displeased
with the hostility

135
00:12:58,162 --> 00:13:02,081
between the palace eunuchs
and the court ladies.

136
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:04,872
And, I can't believe someone
wrote an anonymous letter.

137
00:13:04,872 --> 00:13:06,162
If anyone discovered misconduct,

138
00:13:06,162 --> 00:13:12,413
then that person should've
reported it to me first.

139
00:13:12,413 --> 00:13:17,162
I know what you two are going through.

140
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:22,162
But, Prince Youngsung is not the only
one who supports this decision.

141
00:13:22,162 --> 00:13:31,162
I, too, want this to serve as an
opportunity to resolve the long conflict.

142
00:13:31,162 --> 00:13:34,162
Do you understand?

143
00:13:34,162 --> 00:13:36,039
Yes, Your Highness.

144
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:40,330
I understand.

145
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:46,914
Your Highness, someone from the Imperial
Court Archives requests to speak with you.

146
00:13:46,914 --> 00:13:51,162
Really?

147
00:13:51,162 --> 00:13:54,747
Tell him to come inside.

148
00:13:54,747 --> 00:13:56,246
Please go inside.

149
00:14:12,288 --> 00:14:14,372
Do you want a new cup?

150
00:14:14,413 --> 00:14:16,288
No, I'm fine.

151
00:14:19,455 --> 00:14:22,039
Just put it down and leave.

152
00:14:33,162 --> 00:14:35,955
There's been a lot of gossip about

153
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:37,288
switching roles among the palace
eunuchs and court ladies.

154
00:14:37,288 --> 00:14:40,162
I expected this from the beginning.

155
00:14:40,162 --> 00:14:45,330
They say not making enemies is
more important than making friends.

156
00:14:45,372 --> 00:14:49,163
Maybe you should refrain from doing
something that'll displease others.

157
00:14:49,163 --> 00:14:54,081
I thought this palace needed some change.

158
00:14:55,205 --> 00:15:02,413
And, that fear of criticism will
stop me from doing anything.

159
00:15:02,413 --> 00:15:08,372
Is something bothering you?

160
00:15:08,372 --> 00:15:11,162
You look distressed.

161
00:15:11,162 --> 00:15:17,664
It's because I have responsibilities
that I don't deserve.

162
00:15:17,664 --> 00:15:23,162
Don't worry. You're doing fine.

163
00:15:23,162 --> 00:15:27,664
I didn't deserve to say that.

164
00:15:27,664 --> 00:15:33,162
Don't say that, Miss Saeryung.

165
00:15:33,162 --> 00:15:39,162
I may not be of much help,
but I'll do my best to help you.

166
00:15:43,162 --> 00:15:49,497
Your Highness, the Empress Dowager
wants to speak with you right away.

167
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:56,455
Prince Youngsung is here.

168
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,163
Tell him to come inside.

169
00:16:09,288 --> 00:16:11,162
Sit down.

170
00:16:17,497 --> 00:16:19,497
Prince Youngsung.

171
00:16:19,497 --> 00:16:21,997
Yes, Your Highness.

172
00:16:21,997 --> 00:16:27,872
I'm going to ask you a question, and I
expect you to answer me truthfully.

173
00:16:27,872 --> 00:16:28,997
I will.

174
00:16:28,997 --> 00:16:41,747
What were you reading in the
Imperial Court Archives that day?

175
00:16:52,205 --> 00:16:55,538
Someone told me something.

176
00:16:55,538 --> 00:17:04,747
Were you reading the Imperial Court Records?

177
00:17:07,162 --> 00:17:10,413
Why are you not answering?

178
00:17:10,413 --> 00:17:15,580
Yes, I did.

179
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:22,162
Didn't you know you're
not supposed to read that?

180
00:17:22,162 --> 00:17:27,162
Are you disrespecting the Imperial
Court's customs, or my words?

181
00:17:27,162 --> 00:17:33,162
Your Highness, I, too, have a question.

182
00:17:33,162 --> 00:17:35,914
According to the Imperial Court Records,

183
00:17:35,914 --> 00:17:50,789
you played a decisive role in
kicking my mother out of the palace.

184
00:17:53,162 --> 00:17:59,081
Is that true?

185
00:18:08,163 --> 00:18:13,162
Yes, it's true.

186
00:18:13,162 --> 00:18:17,162
I don't know what's written in the Records,

187
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:25,162
but I had no choice but to let your
mother go in order to save your father

188
00:18:25,162 --> 00:18:35,162
who was the heir apparent at the time.

189
00:18:35,162 --> 00:18:37,914
But, my mother was...

190
00:18:37,914 --> 00:18:41,830
What about her?

191
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:45,162
Don't you know that breaking
an Imperial Court custom

192
00:18:45,162 --> 00:18:51,914
by misusing your authority as
a regent is a grave mistake?

193
00:18:53,162 --> 00:18:58,580
How dare you speak rebelliously
toward me about your mother!

194
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:03,330
I won't let you go this time.

195
00:19:03,372 --> 00:19:12,413
I will deprive you of your regency rights
to set discipline in the Imperial Court!

196
00:19:12,455 --> 00:19:22,162
You should go back to your chambers
and stay put until the Empress is back.

197
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,162
What?

198
00:19:25,162 --> 00:19:30,162
Prince Youngsung's regency
rights have been revoked?

199
00:19:31,205 --> 00:19:33,162
Is this true?

200
00:20:17,266 --> 00:20:21,266
[Prince Hours]

201
00:20:37,372 --> 00:20:40,162
I'm sure you heard about
what happened yesterday.

202
00:20:40,162 --> 00:20:46,162
I can't act as a regent anymore.

203
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:50,622
I'd like to go outside right now.

204
00:20:50,622 --> 00:20:57,162
Although your regency rights have
been revoked, you're still a Prince.

205
00:20:57,162 --> 00:20:59,789
You should show some remorse.

206
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:08,162
Thank you for your concern,
but this can't wait.

207
00:21:08,162 --> 00:21:15,162
You're the only person
I can ask at this early hour.

208
00:21:15,162 --> 00:21:22,162
As the Acting Regent, please let me
leave the palace for a while.

209
00:21:25,455 --> 00:21:27,372
Prince Youngsung!

210
00:21:27,372 --> 00:21:29,664
Prince Youngsung!

211
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:34,162
Prince Youngsung has disappeared again?

212
00:21:34,162 --> 00:21:36,413
What's going on?

213
00:21:36,413 --> 00:21:38,372
Forgive me, Your Highness.

214
00:21:38,413 --> 00:21:43,622
We have people looking for him.

215
00:21:43,622 --> 00:21:46,162
What is he trying to do?

216
00:21:46,162 --> 00:21:52,413
I think he's rebelling against me!

217
00:21:52,413 --> 00:21:59,455
He probably did this out of anger
since I took away his regency rights.

218
00:21:59,455 --> 00:22:04,246
Your Highness, I'm sure he had a reason.

219
00:22:04,246 --> 00:22:10,162
He's not his ignorant self anymore.

220
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:18,162
I don't understand why he would do this now.

221
00:22:18,162 --> 00:22:24,372
Maybe he left a message to the
residential attendants or eunuchs.

222
00:22:24,372 --> 00:22:31,162
Please try to remain calm until
we find out what has happened.

223
00:22:31,162 --> 00:22:32,830
Very well.

224
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,455
Lady Yoo, go and bring
Prince Moonsung immediately.

225
00:22:37,455 --> 00:22:43,162
I'll ask him directly if Prince
Youngsung left him a message.

226
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:45,997
Yes, Your Highness.

227
00:22:50,705 --> 00:22:54,872
I can't believe this is happening.

228
00:23:09,162 --> 00:23:12,955
What are you thinking about?

229
00:23:12,955 --> 00:23:14,162
Father!

230
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:24,162
I just heard Prince Youngsung left
the palace without permission

231
00:23:24,162 --> 00:23:28,122
after his regency rights were stripped away.

232
00:23:28,122 --> 00:23:35,162
The Empress Dowager thinks Prince
Youngsung is rebelling against her.

233
00:23:35,162 --> 00:23:37,413
But...

234
00:23:37,413 --> 00:23:42,162
This means you won this round.

235
00:23:42,162 --> 00:23:49,162
I wonder what the Royal Kin will
say when they hear this news.

236
00:23:49,162 --> 00:23:56,162
Leaving the palace again without
permission is a huge blow.

237
00:23:56,162 --> 00:23:59,246
But, he didn't.

238
00:23:59,288 --> 00:24:02,455
He reported to me before he left.

239
00:24:02,455 --> 00:24:10,914
He asked me for my
permission as Acting Regent.

240
00:24:10,914 --> 00:24:13,747
Is that so?

241
00:24:13,747 --> 00:24:17,162
Then, all you need to do
is keep your mouth shut.

242
00:24:17,162 --> 00:24:18,162
Father!

243
00:24:18,162 --> 00:24:20,162
Remember when I asked you

244
00:24:20,162 --> 00:24:28,122
whether you think all you need are
talent and skill to be Crown Prince?

245
00:24:28,122 --> 00:24:31,747
Look at the outcome so far.

246
00:24:31,747 --> 00:24:34,162
You lost to Prince Youngsung
for the literature round.

247
00:24:34,162 --> 00:24:37,413
You barely won the martial-arts round.

248
00:24:37,413 --> 00:24:43,497
How do you think you did for the art round?

249
00:24:43,497 --> 00:24:47,162
Do you think you won?

250
00:24:47,162 --> 00:24:48,747
Well...

251
00:24:57,205 --> 00:25:00,162
Don't you get it?

252
00:25:00,162 --> 00:25:05,246
If you lose this round,
you lose everything.

253
00:25:05,246 --> 00:25:11,664
Do you still think you can become Crown
Prince on talent and skill alone?

254
00:25:27,997 --> 00:25:31,162
I heard...

255
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:36,997
you requested to have Attendant
Yang Sooneui as your study buddy.

256
00:25:36,997 --> 00:25:44,413
Your mother is against it, but I'm for it.

257
00:25:44,413 --> 00:25:46,162
You finally learned

258
00:25:46,162 --> 00:25:53,162
if you can't have something, you should
stop other people from taking it.

259
00:25:55,246 --> 00:26:00,622
Lady Yoo will soon take you
to the Empress Dowager.

260
00:26:00,622 --> 00:26:06,747
She'll ask you if you know anything
about Prince Youngsung's absence.

261
00:26:06,747 --> 00:26:10,997
Remember this.

262
00:26:10,997 --> 00:26:15,162
What you say in front of the
Empress Dowager will determine

263
00:26:15,162 --> 00:26:24,162
whether you can be the Emperor in the future.

264
00:26:36,162 --> 00:26:38,914
What happened?

265
00:26:38,914 --> 00:26:47,162
Did Prince Youngsung say anything
to you before he left the palace?

266
00:26:47,162 --> 00:26:50,789
He didn't say anything to me.

267
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:54,122
I see...

268
00:26:54,122 --> 00:26:58,580
Really?

269
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,162
Are you serious?

270
00:27:00,162 --> 00:27:02,914
About Prince Youngsung's regency rights?

271
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:09,162
Yes, the entire palace is talking about it.

272
00:27:09,162 --> 00:27:14,455
This means Prince Youngsung
will lose this round.

273
00:27:20,162 --> 00:27:21,246
Attendant Yang!

274
00:27:31,162 --> 00:27:35,162
What are you doing?

275
00:27:35,162 --> 00:27:38,162
Prince Youngsung's disappeared.

276
00:27:38,162 --> 00:27:40,162
What?

277
00:27:40,162 --> 00:27:43,162
What do you mean?

278
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:46,246
Did he call you?

279
00:27:46,288 --> 00:27:49,162
Did he tell you where he is right now?

280
00:28:54,162 --> 00:28:58,162
Hi, Mom.

281
00:28:58,162 --> 00:29:01,830
I came here to see you.

282
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:06,580
Okay, Bulbam.

283
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:10,162
I think I can find my way.

284
00:29:10,162 --> 00:29:13,789
I don't know what happened either.

285
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:16,705
Thanks.

286
00:29:16,705 --> 00:29:19,162
I'll call you if I see him.

287
00:29:19,162 --> 00:29:20,497
Bye.

288
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:36,705
I think I have to take off early today.

289
00:29:36,705 --> 00:29:38,914
I'm sorry.

290
00:29:38,914 --> 00:29:40,580
Is something wrong?

291
00:30:03,162 --> 00:30:04,162
Please leave a message...

292
00:30:22,162 --> 00:30:25,162
Are you sure you don't know anything?

293
00:30:25,162 --> 00:30:30,330
The attendants said it probably
has to do with his mother,

294
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:35,413
but I don't know the details.

295
00:30:35,413 --> 00:30:39,162
I wonder where he went.

296
00:30:39,162 --> 00:30:41,330
Attendant Yang left early for the day.

297
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:46,288
That means the two are together.

298
00:30:46,372 --> 00:30:51,705
I have a bad feeling about this.

299
00:30:51,705 --> 00:30:57,162
I feel as though those
two will be gone forever.

300
00:31:06,162 --> 00:31:10,162
Did Prince Youngsung call you?

301
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:17,330
If he does, ask him where he is, and tell me.

302
00:31:23,372 --> 00:31:30,914
Maybe he's at the Grand Duchess' burial site.

303
00:31:30,914 --> 00:31:37,162
If this concerns his mother,
maybe he's there.

304
00:31:40,162 --> 00:31:43,162
Do you know where that is?

305
00:31:51,497 --> 00:31:54,538
Hello, this is The Palace.

306
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:57,162
Oh, hello.

307
00:32:00,162 --> 00:32:04,413
Did something happen to His Highness?

308
00:32:13,288 --> 00:32:23,162
Grand Duchess Hyoin's scandal
shook the entire nation.

309
00:32:23,162 --> 00:32:26,622
The citizens and the Royal Kin's
criticisms are getting fiercer.

310
00:32:26,622 --> 00:32:30,163
More and more people wanted me to

311
00:32:30,163 --> 00:32:33,664
strip Grand Duchess Kang of
her status as a royal.

312
00:32:33,664 --> 00:32:39,622
I needed to make a decision, and asked
the Grand Duchess one last time.

313
00:32:39,622 --> 00:32:45,162
She only cried and told me
that everything is her fault.

314
00:32:45,162 --> 00:32:49,162
She didn't explain anything
or give me an excuse.

315
00:32:49,162 --> 00:32:57,163
She only told me that she's sorry,
and asked to be kicked out of the palace.

316
00:33:32,246 --> 00:33:36,246
I'm sorry, but can you go faster?

317
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:49,497
Tell me the truth, Mom.

318
00:33:49,538 --> 00:33:54,372
Isn't it about time you told me?

319
00:33:54,372 --> 00:33:57,413
Why?

320
00:33:57,413 --> 00:34:01,162
What did you do that for?

321
00:34:01,162 --> 00:34:05,455
Why? Why?

322
00:34:36,162 --> 00:34:41,955
Did you come here to see me?

323
00:34:44,246 --> 00:34:47,162
You did?

324
00:34:47,162 --> 00:34:48,497
You jerk!

325
00:34:48,497 --> 00:34:51,162
I was worried about you!

326
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:14,162
Thanks... for coming.

327
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:28,163
Shouldn't you go back?

328
00:36:31,288 --> 00:36:37,162
I'm sure that's what your
mother wants you to do.

329
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:44,330
I think I'm lost.

330
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:50,455
I don't know where I'm supposed to go.

331
00:36:50,497 --> 00:36:54,162
Yang Sooneui...

332
00:36:54,162 --> 00:37:04,455
What I can't stand is that I'm with my
mom right now, yet I can't trust her.

333
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:07,162
I can't stand it.

334
00:37:13,162 --> 00:37:16,622
I can punish you right away,

335
00:37:16,622 --> 00:37:27,747
but I will let you go this time because
of your past services to the Empress.

336
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:34,162
This will never happen again.

337
00:37:35,163 --> 00:37:39,934
Still, no matter how shocked
he is, that's not a

338
00:37:39,934 --> 00:37:44,705
reason to leave the
palace without permission.

339
00:37:44,705 --> 00:37:53,162
Why can't he let go of the past?

340
00:37:53,162 --> 00:37:55,246
Please try to understand

341
00:37:55,246 --> 00:38:02,081
how lonely the Prince must've been
after he lost his parents at a young age.

342
00:38:02,081 --> 00:38:06,162
Children are like sunflowers.

343
00:38:06,162 --> 00:38:10,162
Their parents are like the sun to them.

344
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:19,162
But, if that sun should disappear one day,
the children are lost in darkness.

345
00:38:19,162 --> 00:38:24,747
I know how that feels.

346
00:38:24,747 --> 00:38:33,162
The truth about the Grand Duchess is
probably everything to the Prince.

347
00:38:33,162 --> 00:38:41,162
I know that, too, but...

348
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:19,310
[Coffee and Beer]

349
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:29,162
I feel as though I'm standing amidst stars.

350
00:39:29,162 --> 00:39:34,162
It must've been tough for
her to collect all these.

351
00:39:37,163 --> 00:39:40,162
Right?

352
00:39:45,372 --> 00:39:50,162
There are so many different
types of bottle caps.

353
00:39:55,288 --> 00:40:02,039
I'm sure there are just as many
truths and lies in this world.

354
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:10,162
Sometimes, the truth turns
into a lie, and a lie into the truth.

355
00:40:10,162 --> 00:40:13,162
She admitted that she did wrong.

356
00:40:13,162 --> 00:40:17,288
She wouldn't have done
that if she didn't do it.

357
00:40:17,288 --> 00:40:20,664
You might be wrong.

358
00:40:20,664 --> 00:40:24,162
I don't know what's what anymore.

359
00:40:24,162 --> 00:40:27,580
Just believe what your
heart tells you to believe.

360
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,497
How can I do that?

361
00:40:29,497 --> 00:40:31,162
She admitted it.

362
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:36,162
Because she's your mom.

363
00:40:36,162 --> 00:40:42,162
Even if my mom did something wrong
and the world hates her, I will defend her.

364
00:40:42,162 --> 00:40:47,162
I will understand her...
because I only have one mother.

365
00:40:47,162 --> 00:40:49,246
That's what family's all about.

366
00:40:53,330 --> 00:41:02,830
My parents told me there are times
when you have no choice but to lie

367
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:07,622
and that's life.

368
00:41:07,622 --> 00:41:12,162
Maybe that's what happened to your mom.

369
00:41:12,162 --> 00:41:17,162
Even if she did commit a crime,
she probably had a good reason.

370
00:41:17,162 --> 00:41:21,162
You can choose whomever you want to believe.

371
00:41:21,162 --> 00:41:27,705
But, remember, you're the only
one who can trust your mom.

372
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:32,372
You know what?

373
00:42:32,372 --> 00:42:37,997
I think we can help each other.

374
00:42:37,997 --> 00:42:42,872
You broke an engagement to get her.

375
00:42:42,872 --> 00:42:49,372
I can't give up on the Prince either.

376
00:42:49,372 --> 00:42:54,455
You sound as if you're proposing an alliance.

377
00:42:54,455 --> 00:42:55,705
I am.

378
00:42:55,705 --> 00:43:02,955
I don't want Attendant Yang
to be part of a deal.

379
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:09,162
My father wants me to marry Prince Youngsung.

380
00:43:09,162 --> 00:43:16,413
I don't mind, but what will
the Imperial Court think?

381
00:43:16,413 --> 00:43:23,372
That's not a problem...
because Prince Youngsung needs me.

382
00:43:25,538 --> 00:43:29,205
Attendant Yang is the problem.

383
00:43:29,205 --> 00:43:33,162
I can't stand seeing her next to
Prince Youngsung anymore.

384
00:43:33,162 --> 00:43:42,162
Are you... sincere about how you
feel toward Prince Youngsung?

385
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:58,330
What kind of an alliance do you want to make?

386
00:44:12,246 --> 00:44:14,372
You should go back to the palace.

387
00:44:14,372 --> 00:44:17,914
Her Majesty will be back soon.

388
00:44:24,455 --> 00:44:26,162
Yang Sooneui.

389
00:44:30,162 --> 00:44:33,830
What am I supposed to strive for now?

390
00:44:40,162 --> 00:44:44,372
Yi Hoo, Prince Youngsung...

391
00:44:47,162 --> 00:44:52,162
You have to find yourself.

392
00:44:52,162 --> 00:44:57,162
Be a great Crown Prince for your parents.

393
00:44:57,162 --> 00:45:01,372
Your Highness Prince Yi Hoo.

394
00:45:01,372 --> 00:45:08,162
The people will learn about
your parents through you,

395
00:45:08,162 --> 00:45:12,162
not through books or newspapers.

396
00:45:12,162 --> 00:45:18,162
Your existence will prove
your parents' innocence.

397
00:45:28,372 --> 00:45:31,162
Close your eyes.

398
00:45:31,162 --> 00:45:35,162
Huh? Why?

399
00:45:35,162 --> 00:45:38,205
Now.

400
00:45:59,246 --> 00:46:02,162
This belongs to your mother.

401
00:46:02,162 --> 00:46:04,538
It's yours now.

402
00:46:04,538 --> 00:46:08,162
I want to give it to you.

403
00:46:10,747 --> 00:46:12,580
It's late.

404
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:14,205
Let's go.

405
00:46:24,162 --> 00:46:26,955
You don't need me to escort you home, right?

406
00:46:26,955 --> 00:46:28,162
Of course not.

407
00:46:28,162 --> 00:46:30,162
Bye.

408
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,914
You go ahead.

409
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:34,622
I'll leave after you leave.

410
00:46:42,162 --> 00:46:44,162
Yang Sooneui!

411
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:26,198
Alex asked me to give this to you.

412
00:49:28,445 --> 00:49:30,046
My goodness.

413
00:49:33,908 --> 00:49:36,789
It's a bell to bring you good luck.

414
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,930
Did anything happen while I was gone?

415
00:49:47,596 --> 00:49:49,377
Something did happen.

416
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:57,452
Now, there's no one in the palace with whom

417
00:49:57,452 --> 00:50:02,892
I can talk about my mother,
and no one I can trust.

418
00:50:06,801 --> 00:50:13,105
I think... it's time to find the truth
about my mother on my own.

419
00:50:14,188 --> 00:50:18,067
I just received a call
from the former director.

420
00:50:19,098 --> 00:50:21,905
He said he has evidence that can
prove the Grand Duchess' innocence,

421
00:50:21,905 --> 00:50:23,970
and wants us to meet tomorrow.

422
00:50:24,885 --> 00:50:28,051
He did? Is it true?

423
00:50:28,572 --> 00:50:34,979
Yes! Again, Saeryung's help was invaluable.

424
00:50:36,173 --> 00:50:41,959
I don't know how she changed his mind.

425
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:44,947
She seems like a good person.

426
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:51,244
The reason why I assigned regency duties

427
00:50:51,244 --> 00:50:56,601
and gave you Imperial authority
wasn't for you to look at the Records!

428
00:50:59,165 --> 00:51:00,867
Yes, I am aware of that.

429
00:51:00,867 --> 00:51:05,826
If you knew that, then how could you have
left the palace again without permission?

430
00:51:10,926 --> 00:51:13,648
I'm not angry about anything else.

431
00:51:13,648 --> 00:51:18,526
How could someone who took a vow
to become Crown Prince act so rashly?

432
00:51:18,526 --> 00:51:22,042
If not the Empress Dowager, then you
should've at least received permission from

433
00:51:22,042 --> 00:51:27,130
Prince Moonsung who had the
authority as Acting Regent!

434
00:51:29,271 --> 00:51:33,408
Had you done that, there would
have been an excuse at least.

435
00:51:36,773 --> 00:51:41,154
I don't know what you're thinking anymore.

436
00:51:43,051 --> 00:51:49,518
An innocent Prince Moonsung was called
to the Empress Dowager and got lectured

437
00:51:49,518 --> 00:51:54,148
on the indifference between the
cousins, apart from the contest.

438
00:51:55,862 --> 00:52:03,133
And, the complaint seemed to have come from
a mistake in the Internal Affairs' ledger.

439
00:52:04,437 --> 00:52:08,555
Your idea to exchange the duties
between the two departments

440
00:52:08,555 --> 00:52:12,072
have created a better understanding.

441
00:52:12,998 --> 00:52:16,660
But, from now on, don't forget
that always following

442
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:21,505
the Imperial customs and order must
come first. Do you understand?

443
00:52:22,241 --> 00:52:25,037
Yes, I will keep that in mind.

444
00:52:32,389 --> 00:52:42,429
Empress, I'm concerned about
Prince Youngsung's future.

445
00:52:42,429 --> 00:52:48,513
After I saw how Prince
Youngsung lost his senses,

446
00:52:48,513 --> 00:52:53,722
broke Imperial customs,
and rebelled against me,

447
00:52:53,722 --> 00:53:00,972
I'm questioning his qualities as an heir.

448
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:07,429
Such emotional damage can threaten

449
00:53:07,429 --> 00:53:16,429
both Prince Youngsung and the
entire Imperial Court in the future.

450
00:53:16,429 --> 00:53:19,764
Mother...

451
00:53:19,764 --> 00:53:26,014
I shouldn't have said that, especially
when you just got back from your trip.

452
00:53:26,014 --> 00:53:32,639
Okay, but you didn't have to
go see the schools just yet.

453
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:41,097
Why were you in such a hurry to go to Africa?

454
00:53:41,097 --> 00:53:49,429
I thought since I was in
Europe, I might as well...

455
00:53:49,429 --> 00:53:53,429
I see, I see.

456
00:54:00,624 --> 00:54:03,238
I was just happy to have spent time with you.

457
00:54:07,288 --> 00:54:12,930
Yes, I love you, too. Good night, my Queen.

458
00:54:46,362 --> 00:54:49,137
What did you say? Alex’s home?

459
00:54:49,137 --> 00:54:54,603
Yes, Your Majesty. They say
Professor Alex wasn't the target.

460
00:54:56,479 --> 00:54:57,573
Is that so...

461
00:54:57,573 --> 00:55:01,783
Your Majesty, it seems
caution is necessary.

462
00:55:02,521 --> 00:55:06,035
With the paparazzi incident during
your trip outside the palace,

463
00:55:06,035 --> 00:55:11,947
it seems someone has sensed your
relationship with Professor Alexander.

464
00:55:14,771 --> 00:55:16,107
Madam Chamberlain...

465
00:55:16,107 --> 00:55:17,238
Yes, Your Majesty.

466
00:55:17,238 --> 00:55:21,370
Tomorrow... You will need to go see Alex.

467
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:23,333
Yes, Your Majesty.

468
00:55:26,368 --> 00:55:29,909
So, you didn't find anything?

469
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:33,908
We looked all over the house
while Professor Alexander was gone,

470
00:55:33,908 --> 00:55:37,908
but couldn't find anything.

471
00:55:37,908 --> 00:55:40,908
Hmm, how clever of them...

472
00:55:40,908 --> 00:55:48,908
But, people like them can easily be shaken.

473
00:55:49,908 --> 00:55:55,034
Did you leave signs of a break-in?

474
00:55:55,034 --> 00:55:59,284
Yes, just as you ordered.

475
00:55:59,284 --> 00:56:02,908
Now that we showed signs
of a deliberate break-in,

476
00:56:02,908 --> 00:56:06,743
they'll be more careful from now on.

477
00:56:06,743 --> 00:56:11,701
Find the Empress and the Professor's
communication network

478
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:14,992
through our court lady in
Her Majesty's quarters.

479
00:56:14,992 --> 00:56:18,992
We need to find hard evidence this time.

480
00:56:18,992 --> 00:56:20,785
Understand?

481
00:56:20,785 --> 00:56:21,992
Yes, my lord.

482
00:56:25,326 --> 00:56:29,618
I have another report to make.

483
00:56:29,618 --> 00:56:32,908
I think the Prime Minister's office convinced

484
00:56:32,908 --> 00:56:41,785
the former ex-director of the foundation
to try to talk to Prince Youngsung.

485
00:56:41,785 --> 00:56:42,908
Really?

486
00:56:47,951 --> 00:56:50,908
Maybe I kept him alive for too long.

487
00:57:06,979 --> 00:57:08,471
Thank you.

488
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:16,548
You seem busier since becoming
Prime Minister. You don't sleep well either.

489
00:57:16,548 --> 00:57:21,443
I think you have more work now that
you're doing your mother's tasks.

490
00:57:21,443 --> 00:57:24,053
I'm fine.

491
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:35,989
Saeryung, I recently went to see the Empress
Dowager and she casually mentioned you.

492
00:57:35,989 --> 00:57:40,721
She seemed very happy you
were helping Prince Youngsung.

493
00:57:41,495 --> 00:57:48,550
So... I wanted to ask you how
you felt about Prince Youngsung.

494
00:57:50,206 --> 00:57:55,677
You've been pretty close
lately. How do you feel?

495
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:06,471
[Prince Hours]

496
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:10,254
What?

497
00:58:10,254 --> 00:58:16,254
The ex-director is dead?

498
00:58:16,254 --> 00:58:19,254
He got into a car accident
at an intersection.

499
00:58:23,464 --> 00:58:27,254
How can this happen?

500
00:58:29,254 --> 00:58:36,254
What about the evidence
he said he'd give us?

501
00:58:36,254 --> 00:58:41,254
I met his family, but they
don't know anything about it.

502
00:58:45,254 --> 00:58:48,254
We're back to the starting point.

503
00:58:48,254 --> 00:58:52,254
That evidence was our only hope.

504
00:58:56,254 --> 00:58:58,089
My lord.

505
00:58:58,089 --> 00:59:03,254
The ex-director talked about
the evidence before he died.

506
00:59:03,254 --> 00:59:05,214
Evidence?

507
00:59:05,214 --> 00:59:07,254
I don't know the details,

508
00:59:07,254 --> 00:59:10,464
but I think he had a copy of
the documents and secret files.

509
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:15,254
Prince Youngsung doesn't have them, does he?

510
00:59:15,254 --> 00:59:17,254
No.

511
00:59:17,254 --> 00:59:21,547
Good.

512
00:59:21,547 --> 00:59:27,254
Whatever that evidence is,
we must find it first.

513
00:59:27,254 --> 00:59:30,254
Yes, my lord.

514
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:40,254
I have a question.

515
00:59:43,254 --> 00:59:48,464
Can you give up the seat of
Crown Prince for Attendant Yang?

516
00:59:48,464 --> 00:59:50,089
What?

517
00:59:50,089 --> 00:59:56,006
If you don't want her to be
unhappy, you should let her go.

518
00:59:57,422 --> 01:00:02,630
I know one thing for sure.

519
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:08,756
I will never make Yang Sooneui
unhappy... no matter what.

520
01:00:08,797 --> 01:00:15,254
I'm sorry to hear you were
scolded by the Empress Dowager.

521
01:00:15,254 --> 01:00:18,254
Oh, that.

522
01:00:18,254 --> 01:00:21,254
I notified you I was leaving that morning,

523
01:00:21,254 --> 01:00:24,173
but you didn't give me permission.

524
01:00:24,173 --> 01:00:26,254
You don't have to feel bad.

525
01:00:30,422 --> 01:00:38,589
I gave two assignments on art and wisdom
on which to evaluate the two Princes.

526
01:00:38,589 --> 01:00:44,254
I'd like the evaluation committee to give
me your opinion on the art assignment.

527
01:00:44,254 --> 01:00:47,131
What does the Royal Kin think?

528
01:00:47,131 --> 01:00:49,254
Everyone in the Royal Kin thinks

529
01:00:49,254 --> 01:01:01,672
that Prince Joon's concert was superior
in both formality and significance.

530
01:01:01,672 --> 01:01:07,047
Your Majesty, may I speak?

531
01:01:07,047 --> 01:01:08,254
Go ahead.

532
01:01:08,254 --> 01:01:18,254
I agree with the Royal Kin,
but that concert had its own judges.

533
01:01:35,254 --> 01:01:39,254
What are these letters about?

534
01:01:39,254 --> 01:01:43,254
They're from the foster care children
who came to the concert that day.

535
01:01:43,254 --> 01:01:46,254
What about their letters?

536
01:01:46,254 --> 01:01:48,254
I'm sure you all know

537
01:01:48,254 --> 01:01:57,505
that this competition's evaluation
committee was selected privately.

538
01:01:57,505 --> 01:02:07,131
Those children formed the most important
part of the evaluation committee.

539
01:02:07,131 --> 01:02:10,964
I heard this ahead of time from Her Majesty,

540
01:02:10,964 --> 01:02:16,254
but I had been silent because it
might've affected the concert.

541
01:02:16,254 --> 01:02:19,254
As a traditional Korean classical musician,

542
01:02:19,254 --> 01:02:22,254
I was skeptical of
Prince Youngsung's concert.

543
01:02:22,254 --> 01:02:29,254
But, I learned something from watching
the children having a good time.

544
01:02:29,254 --> 01:02:40,254
Maybe art is best understood by innocent
children who do not have any standards.

545
01:02:40,254 --> 01:02:45,756
All the children were pleased with
Prince Youngsung's performance.

546
01:02:45,756 --> 01:02:48,047
Your Majesty!

547
01:02:48,047 --> 01:02:52,254
They're only little kids!

548
01:02:52,254 --> 01:02:55,797
Besides, I can't approve of such
an unprecedented performance.

549
01:02:55,797 --> 01:03:00,422
One form of art is beautiful
because it has formality.

550
01:03:00,422 --> 01:03:06,047
The other is also beautiful
with its unprecedented form.

551
01:03:08,422 --> 01:03:10,881
I have an idea.

552
01:03:12,297 --> 01:03:19,672
Prince Moonsung's concert
was very artistic in many ways.

553
01:03:19,672 --> 01:03:29,254
Prince Youngsung's concert made
the children have a good time.

554
01:03:29,254 --> 01:03:36,338
Since both yielded good
results, let's call it a tie.

555
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:43,881
It's a tie!

556
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:47,254
It's a tie!

557
01:03:47,254 --> 01:03:51,254
What about Wisdom?

558
01:03:51,254 --> 01:03:58,464
I asked the two Princes to act as my regents
while I was away from the palace.

559
01:03:58,505 --> 01:04:05,254
Their assignment was to fulfill
the duties of a monarch wisely.

560
01:04:05,254 --> 01:04:12,254
But, Prince Youngsung was
disqualified during the process,

561
01:04:12,254 --> 01:04:19,173
which means that Prince Moonsung
won the Wisdom part of the test.

562
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:29,254
Now, all we have left are Courage and Virtue.

563
01:04:29,254 --> 01:04:38,254
Your Majesty, forgive me for saying this,
but the competition should end at this point.

564
01:04:38,254 --> 01:04:39,797
This competition is about

565
01:04:39,797 --> 01:04:46,089
which of the two Princes is more
qualified to be Crown Prince.

566
01:04:46,089 --> 01:04:52,756
But, Prince Youngsung left the palace
during competition without permission.

567
01:04:52,756 --> 01:05:00,547
This is like giving up
the competition altogether.

568
01:05:00,547 --> 01:05:07,254
It is only right to deprive Prince Youngsung
of his candidacy for Crown Prince.

569
01:05:07,254 --> 01:05:09,630
Please take this into consideration,
Your Majesty.

570
01:05:09,630 --> 01:05:12,589
Please take this into consideration,
Your Majesty.
