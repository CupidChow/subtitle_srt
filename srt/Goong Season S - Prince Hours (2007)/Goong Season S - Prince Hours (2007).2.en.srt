1
00:00:51,407 --> 00:00:53,488
What are you doing?

2
00:00:56,047 --> 00:00:57,161
Hey!

3
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,613
Saeryung is always very pretty.

4
00:02:11,613 --> 00:02:16,242
I am getting jealous of her male
classmates even at this old age.

5
00:02:17,943 --> 00:02:24,172
Hearing you praise her like that,
I'm a bit embarrassed.

6
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:28,319
My wife and I think we spoiled her too much.

7
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,495
We are always worried about her.

8
00:02:33,495 --> 00:02:36,707
Mr. Deputy Prime Minister, you're too humble.

9
00:02:37,847 --> 00:02:41,927
Saeryung has what it takes
to become the future Empress.

10
00:02:41,927 --> 00:02:43,534
Isn't that so, honey?

11
00:02:44,975 --> 00:02:50,698
I, too, think she's the best candidate
for Empress this country will ever have.

12
00:02:56,926 --> 00:03:01,910
I have many other school activities, so I
only practiced for about 2 weeks or so.

13
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,358
- 2 weeks?
- Yes.

14
00:03:03,358 --> 00:03:06,250
How was my dance?

15
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,120
- It was great.
- Thank you!

16
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,375
Which couple do you think danced the best?

17
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:15,032
Well, since Prince Joon and I
have been friends since we were little...

18
00:03:15,032 --> 00:03:16,897
I enjoyed your performance!

19
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:19,031
- Thank you.
- Then...

20
00:03:26,296 --> 00:03:30,654
You did the martial arts
demonstration earlier, right?

21
00:03:31,801 --> 00:03:32,698
Yes!

22
00:03:32,698 --> 00:03:36,658
It was really you! You were really cool!

23
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:38,859
Are you a martial artist?

24
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:40,420
I learned a little before.

25
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,814
No wonder you had good form!

26
00:03:43,814 --> 00:03:46,436
Men are all about looking good, right?

27
00:03:46,436 --> 00:03:51,316
But, that sword dance you did...
why did you do it like that?

28
00:03:51,316 --> 00:03:53,932
It was a fly in the ointment.

29
00:03:53,932 --> 00:03:56,494
But, your martial arts demonstration
was really good though!

30
00:03:56,494 --> 00:04:00,712
Martial arts is not about looking good,
it's a spiritual practice.

31
00:04:03,562 --> 00:04:05,411
It seems as though you
know how to look good yourself.

32
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,330
I'd like you to instruct me some time.

33
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,937
Anytime!

34
00:04:09,937 --> 00:04:13,676
But, was that a real sword?

35
00:04:15,302 --> 00:04:17,298
It was a pleasure to meet you.

36
00:04:24,626 --> 00:04:25,997
Yang Sooneui!

37
00:04:30,451 --> 00:04:33,400
Hey, can't you hear me?

38
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,197
What?

39
00:04:42,644 --> 00:04:46,194
Long time no see.

40
00:04:46,194 --> 00:04:48,519
It's been 7 years, right?

41
00:04:49,865 --> 00:04:51,238
I think so.

42
00:04:51,914 --> 00:04:54,909
But, what are you doing here?

43
00:04:55,884 --> 00:04:57,581
You work here?

44
00:04:58,082 --> 00:05:00,586
Yes, I work here!

45
00:05:00,586 --> 00:05:05,361
I successfully passed the royal exam
to become a court attendant.

46
00:05:06,252 --> 00:05:09,007
I'm only a trainee right now though.

47
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:15,659
So, you're like a maid like in
those historical dramas, right?

48
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,857
I thought you were a princess
because you were so arrogant.

49
00:05:21,857 --> 00:05:24,776
What about you? What are you doing here?

50
00:05:24,776 --> 00:05:26,941
How did you get in here?

51
00:05:27,768 --> 00:05:30,129
I see!

52
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:33,219
You must work for the company
that's going to host the funfest tonight.

53
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:34,838
Right?

54
00:05:34,838 --> 00:05:39,123
Funfest?

55
00:05:39,123 --> 00:05:42,491
True, this is a great event.

56
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:44,173
You don't know me?

57
00:05:44,173 --> 00:05:46,821
I'm popular wherever I go, you know!

58
00:05:46,821 --> 00:05:51,123
Geez! You haven't changed
a bit, you narcissist!

59
00:05:51,123 --> 00:05:53,863
You haven't changed either, Ms. Attitude!

60
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:58,907
Anyway, you can't just walk around here.

61
00:05:58,907 --> 00:06:02,275
You better leave before you get into trouble!

62
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:07,091
Hey! We were classmates
from 1st through 8th grade.

63
00:06:07,091 --> 00:06:09,023
Aren't you happy to see me?

64
00:06:09,923 --> 00:06:12,806
What about you? Are you?

65
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:14,062
No!

66
00:06:14,062 --> 00:06:15,592
Me neither!

67
00:06:15,592 --> 00:06:17,657
But, when I ran into you earlier,

68
00:06:17,657 --> 00:06:22,653
I was a bit touched thinking what a darned
fate this is that keeps bringing us together.

69
00:06:23,528 --> 00:06:24,545
Exactly!

70
00:06:24,545 --> 00:06:27,382
Not running into each other
would've been best for both of us!

71
00:06:27,382 --> 00:06:28,618
I'm going!

72
00:06:28,618 --> 00:06:30,057
Go then!

73
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,716
Hey, Yang Sooneui?

74
00:06:33,415 --> 00:06:34,426
What?

75
00:06:34,426 --> 00:06:37,871
I'm afraid we'll run into each
other a lot in the future.

76
00:06:37,871 --> 00:06:39,129
What?

77
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:42,809
By the way, do you still
easily forget things?

78
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,014
I hope you don't get lost
in this huge palace.

79
00:06:48,643 --> 00:06:52,227
How about you? Do you still wear long johns?

80
00:06:52,227 --> 00:06:55,183
You used to wear them until spring break!

81
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,317
Heh!

82
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,753
How did I run into that rascal again?

83
00:07:15,464 --> 00:07:18,473
What? We'll run into each
other a lot in the future?

84
00:07:18,473 --> 00:07:20,873
What a liar!

85
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:23,273
You can't go in and out of
the palace as you please!

86
00:07:23,273 --> 00:07:24,860
What a joke!

87
00:07:29,095 --> 00:07:30,687
I am sorry!

88
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,396
I am so sorry!

89
00:07:34,396 --> 00:07:37,167
I wasn't paying attention.

90
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:40,481
You must've been really absorbed if you
couldn't even see the person in front of you.

91
00:07:40,481 --> 00:07:41,661
Pardon?

92
00:07:42,737 --> 00:07:46,477
You're heavier than you look.

93
00:07:48,585 --> 00:07:51,184
Are you hurt anywhere?

94
00:07:51,184 --> 00:07:54,092
From now on, watch what's in
front of you when walking.

95
00:07:55,048 --> 00:07:57,775
I will be careful from now on.

96
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,603
Then...

97
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,155
Excuse...

98
00:08:07,313 --> 00:08:08,554
Ouch!

99
00:08:32,536 --> 00:08:35,094
I still have to try harder.

100
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:37,090
You're always number one in the class.

101
00:08:38,878 --> 00:08:40,825
I love your earrings!

102
00:08:40,825 --> 00:08:43,712
My mother sent them from New York.

103
00:08:43,712 --> 00:08:45,116
I love them, too.

104
00:08:46,248 --> 00:08:48,884
That guy keeps staring at you.

105
00:08:48,884 --> 00:08:50,179
What?

106
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:51,825
That guy over there!

107
00:09:13,555 --> 00:09:17,756
Ladies and gentlemen, please rise.

108
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:20,208
Her Majesty the Empress has arrived!

109
00:10:11,112 --> 00:10:14,685
Hello, Your Majesty!
I sincerely welcome you.

110
00:10:16,753 --> 00:10:19,901
Thank you for inviting me.

111
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:43,313
Did you enjoy the martial arts demonstration?

112
00:10:43,313 --> 00:10:45,858
Yes, it was really cool!

113
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:49,562
I trust it was a good time.

114
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:59,262
It's been 2 years since Crown
Prince Hwemin passed away.

115
00:10:59,262 --> 00:11:01,366
For the sake of the Imperial Court,

116
00:11:01,366 --> 00:11:06,055
we can't leave the position
vacant, not even for a day.

117
00:11:06,055 --> 00:11:08,478
You are right!

118
00:11:08,478 --> 00:11:11,702
We cannot wait any longer
for an heir to the throne.

119
00:11:11,702 --> 00:11:19,964
We, the Imperial Court, believe Prince Joon
is the best candidate to be a successor.

120
00:11:19,964 --> 00:11:23,552
Mr. Deputy Prime Minister,
what is your opinion?

121
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:29,249
The Royal Council does
not object to the idea of

122
00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:33,158
appointing an heir as soon as possible.

123
00:11:33,158 --> 00:11:36,432
Mr. Prime Minister has also agreed.

124
00:11:37,013 --> 00:11:43,702
Although the government committee is the
final decision-maker for appointing an heir,

125
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:47,597
it must be approved by Her Majesty.

126
00:11:47,597 --> 00:11:50,975
But, if the Prime Minister thinks that way,

127
00:11:50,975 --> 00:11:54,754
then Her Majesty can no
longer delay the issue.

128
00:12:02,045 --> 00:12:04,250
Her Majesty is making her arrival.

129
00:12:25,966 --> 00:12:29,836
I hope I didn't interrupt anything.

130
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:35,483
It is my honor just to be here
with you tonight, Your Highness.

131
00:12:47,732 --> 00:12:50,892
They say people like compliments.

132
00:12:50,892 --> 00:12:56,873
Listening to you always makes my ears happy.

133
00:13:00,564 --> 00:13:02,752
I am grateful, Your Majesty.

134
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:08,572
Today is definitely a joyful day.

135
00:13:08,572 --> 00:13:15,868
I have great news to share

136
00:13:15,868 --> 00:13:21,564
while all members of the Imperial Court
and the parliament are here.

137
00:13:23,276 --> 00:13:28,678
What is it that the Imperial Household
has been waiting for all this time?

138
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:33,850
An heir, is it not?

139
00:13:34,903 --> 00:13:39,662
I'm going to introduce to you someone
who's going to surprise you all.

140
00:13:39,662 --> 00:13:47,386
I hope everyone can understand why
I've been delaying in appointing an heir.

141
00:13:50,134 --> 00:13:52,594
Prince Hoo, please step forward.

142
00:14:13,758 --> 00:14:16,847
Keep in mind what I tell you.

143
00:14:16,847 --> 00:14:24,958
The people here are high-status officials
of the Imperial Court and parliament.

144
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,030
Show your loyalty to your country

145
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:32,371
and your determination to do your duty
by paying your respects to them,

146
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:41,807
I'm pleased to make your acquaintance.

147
00:14:41,807 --> 00:14:44,313
My name is Kang...

148
00:14:44,313 --> 00:14:46,123
Yi Hoo.

149
00:14:55,336 --> 00:15:01,440
Prince Hoo here is a relative of Her Majesty.

150
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,279
He's a direct descendant of Emperor Shin Jo,

151
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:12,588
and the biological son of the late
Grand Prince Hyoin and his wife.

152
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:23,135
I'm very happy and excited
to find a relative of mine.

153
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:27,480
I'm going to have his name
entered in the family register.

154
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,030
Royal Council, please take
care of all the paperwork.

155
00:15:41,911 --> 00:15:44,411
Boyfriend, did you order black-bean noodles?

156
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:52,677
Boyfriend, did you order black-bean noodles?

157
00:15:53,848 --> 00:15:56,427
Boyfriend, did you order black-bean noodles?

158
00:15:58,223 --> 00:15:59,418
Hello?

159
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:02,799
You bastard! Are you scared?

160
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:04,885
Are you?

161
00:16:04,885 --> 00:16:08,622
Stop running! When are you going to face me?

162
00:16:08,622 --> 00:16:10,349
You got the wrong number.

163
00:16:10,349 --> 00:16:11,681
Hello?

164
00:16:17,116 --> 00:16:19,529
Boyfriend, did you order black-bean noodles?

165
00:16:22,846 --> 00:16:27,897
Boyfriend, did you order black-bean noodles?
Boyfriend, did you order black-bean noodles?

166
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,656
Boyfriend, did you order black-bean noodles?

167
00:16:32,477 --> 00:16:35,257
Boyfriend, did you order black-bean noodles?

168
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:46,725
The Empress embarrassed herself tonight.

169
00:16:46,725 --> 00:16:50,556
It will take her a long
time to discipline him.

170
00:16:50,556 --> 00:16:54,610
Did you see her face when that phone rang?

171
00:16:56,332 --> 00:16:59,542
How can you laugh at a time like this?

172
00:16:59,542 --> 00:17:02,659
A direct descendent has
appeared all of a sudden.

173
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:07,092
I was so shocked I thought
my heart stopped beating.

174
00:17:08,991 --> 00:17:10,378
Joon?

175
00:17:11,022 --> 00:17:12,606
Yes, Father.

176
00:17:12,606 --> 00:17:16,065
Don't ever forget the
discrimination I suffered

177
00:17:16,065 --> 00:17:20,337
because I come from an indirect line.

178
00:17:20,337 --> 00:17:24,095
Also, don't ever forget
all the hard work I've done

179
00:17:24,095 --> 00:17:28,246
to stop you going through the same pain.

180
00:17:28,246 --> 00:17:31,240
I will never forget.

181
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:37,240
Let's think of this as the last challenge
that fate is putting us through.

182
00:17:49,924 --> 00:17:55,181
Boyfriend, did you order black-bean noodles?
Boyfriend, did you order black-bean noodles?

183
00:17:57,082 --> 00:17:59,855
Mother, this is not a laughing matter.

184
00:18:02,004 --> 00:18:03,682
It is not!

185
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,859
But, I can imagine the expressions

186
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:10,191
on the faces of the government
officials and aristocrats.

187
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:15,703
I missed such a spectacle.

188
00:18:17,576 --> 00:18:18,781
Prince Hoo.

189
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,369
Yes, Your Majesty.

190
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:24,553
I'm going to have the court
attendant keep your cell phone.

191
00:18:24,553 --> 00:18:25,806
What?

192
00:18:26,841 --> 00:18:28,203
But...

193
00:18:43,383 --> 00:18:47,988
It'll be returned to you once
you get used to living in the palace.

194
00:18:49,665 --> 00:18:50,739
Yes, ma'am.

195
00:18:52,782 --> 00:18:57,278
So, where should Prince Hoo live?

196
00:18:57,278 --> 00:19:00,951
Do you have any plans?

197
00:19:00,951 --> 00:19:04,440
He's currently staying at a guest house.

198
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,487
According to the Imperial law,

199
00:19:06,487 --> 00:19:12,993
he cannot stay in the palace for long
until he officially becomes a Crown Prince.

200
00:19:12,993 --> 00:19:18,967
He could stay at his late father's house
or at the academy dorm...

201
00:19:18,967 --> 00:19:20,960
That cannot happen!

202
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,064
They're both outside the palace!

203
00:19:24,804 --> 00:19:27,636
Don't you know what kind of people they are?

204
00:19:27,636 --> 00:19:32,500
We learned about Prince Hoo's
existence only a week ago.

205
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,761
Yet, they somehow found out
and tried to kidnap him!

206
00:19:36,761 --> 00:19:39,563
Forgive me, Your Majesty!

207
00:19:39,563 --> 00:19:45,675
We're currently investigating
how it all happened.

208
00:19:45,675 --> 00:19:50,923
Please forgive us for almost
failing to carry out your order.

209
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:54,162
Prince Hoo must live inside the palace.

210
00:19:54,162 --> 00:19:56,799
Only then will I have peace of mind.

211
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:00,211
Please think of a way.

212
00:20:00,211 --> 00:20:02,710
Yes, Your Majesty!

213
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,114
Yummy!

214
00:20:12,114 --> 00:20:15,737
Your mom makes really good kimchi.

215
00:20:15,737 --> 00:20:18,789
The food at the party was so greasy.

216
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:20,471
I feel much better now.

217
00:20:21,266 --> 00:20:25,806
So he's really a prince, huh?

218
00:20:29,386 --> 00:20:30,914
Don't you think that's shocking?

219
00:20:30,914 --> 00:20:34,730
A Chinese-food delivery
boy becoming a prince?

220
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:38,707
This is like something you see on TV.

221
00:20:38,707 --> 00:20:40,413
A soap opera!

222
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:43,635
It can't be! No way!

223
00:20:49,505 --> 00:20:53,255
There's no way that arrogant
narcissist is a prince!

224
00:20:54,137 --> 00:20:56,070
- By the way...
- Yes?

225
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,742
Do you know him?

226
00:20:57,742 --> 00:20:59,656
What?

227
00:20:59,656 --> 00:21:03,048
No, how?

228
00:21:03,048 --> 00:21:04,717
I don't know him.

229
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:18,333
This is some bad luck!

230
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:22,395
He used to get into trouble and got
yelled at by the teacher all the time.

231
00:21:22,395 --> 00:21:27,487
Just ask our 6th-grade teacher
if any of this makes sense!

232
00:21:37,394 --> 00:21:40,919
[Prince Hours]

233
00:21:43,612 --> 00:21:46,571
In the past few days,
you've studied the terms

234
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:50,276
that are used by the Imperial Court.

235
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:53,395
Yes, I was forced to do it.

236
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:56,267
But, do I really have to talk like that?

237
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:02,637
Please remember the customs of
the Royal Palace start with language.

238
00:22:03,904 --> 00:22:11,195
Starting today, you'll be
taught the required etiquette

239
00:22:11,195 --> 00:22:13,589
and knowledge necessary
to live a life of royalty.

240
00:22:13,589 --> 00:22:14,884
What?

241
00:22:16,408 --> 00:22:18,000
I really don't want to learn...

242
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,178
You must also learn the Imperial
customs and proper etiquette

243
00:22:22,178 --> 00:22:25,223
to adapt quickly to life inside the palace.

244
00:22:25,891 --> 00:22:33,224
Her Majesty personally prepared all this,
so please devote yourself to studying it.

245
00:22:35,107 --> 00:22:37,103
Everybody, come in.

246
00:22:46,023 --> 00:22:47,825
What's all this?

247
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:53,318
Do you have any knowledge
of the Imperial Court?

248
00:22:53,318 --> 00:22:55,423
I learned that in school, of course.

249
00:22:55,423 --> 00:23:02,029
King Tae, Jong, Tae, Se, Moon, Dan, Se...

250
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:05,393
and then I'm not sure about the rest.

251
00:23:06,141 --> 00:23:08,813
I see what level you are.

252
00:23:08,813 --> 00:23:12,640
I will teach you at your level.

253
00:23:13,197 --> 00:23:19,493
You have a nice face and body,
and great common sense, too!

254
00:23:19,493 --> 00:23:20,737
You're too perfect!

255
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,266
[The Imperial Family's Genealogy]

256
00:23:37,846 --> 00:23:39,225
What is this?

257
00:23:39,766 --> 00:23:49,607
This is a simple family tree that shows
all the past kings and their sons.

258
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,101
A member of the Imperial Court
must know this much at least.

259
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,334
I have to learn all this in one day?

260
00:23:57,334 --> 00:23:59,134
You don't think you can do it?

261
00:23:59,134 --> 00:24:01,285
I'm a smart person.

262
00:24:01,285 --> 00:24:03,944
I can memorize anything
if it's something I like.

263
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:05,450
You want to hear?

264
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:08,513
There are 6 major clans of kung fu.

265
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,144
Number one is Shaolin.

266
00:24:10,144 --> 00:24:13,166
You know the Shaolin Temple, right?

267
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:14,670
Some of the Shaolin kung fu styles

268
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:17,556
include Shaolin Sword, Shaolin Spear,
Twelve Styles of Yijinjing,

269
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:20,709
the Shaolin Cudgel, and the
Eighteen Types of Shaolin Weapons!

270
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,533
Next is Wu Tang, which is
a Taoist-influenced school.

271
00:24:23,533 --> 00:24:25,678
Their fighting skills include
the Arts of the White Python,

272
00:24:25,678 --> 00:24:30,117
Tai Chi Ch'uan, Dragon Veins of H'sing-I
Ch'uan, and Black Scorpion Ground Fighting!

273
00:24:30,117 --> 00:24:33,069
I'm getting tired. Then, there's...

274
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:36,471
I got it, Your Highness.

275
00:24:36,471 --> 00:24:42,986
If your memory is that good, you can
memorize the family tree in one day.

276
00:24:44,846 --> 00:24:46,553
I didn't mean it like that.

277
00:24:48,901 --> 00:24:53,205
Aww, my stomach suddenly hurts!

278
00:24:53,205 --> 00:24:57,596
My head hurts, too,
and I can't really concentrate.

279
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,626
Can we do this when I
have better concentration?

280
00:25:05,598 --> 00:25:07,822
This is a learning aide.

281
00:25:07,822 --> 00:25:11,077
When you wear this, your
concentration level will increase.

282
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:12,867
So don't worry.

283
00:25:14,053 --> 00:25:16,539
Do I just put them in my ears?

284
00:25:18,804 --> 00:25:19,304
Piddy-piddy pid.

285
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:39,464
You can't hold your rice bowl in your hands.

286
00:25:39,464 --> 00:25:41,235
Please put it down.

287
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:48,657
You can't pick up the spoon
and chopsticks at the same time.

288
00:25:50,365 --> 00:25:53,153
You must eat rice with a spoon only.

289
00:25:56,829 --> 00:25:59,694
You're using the chopsticks incorrectly.

290
00:26:00,586 --> 00:26:05,690
Your thumb and the ring finger
work like an axis and a lever.

291
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:09,682
Rest the chopsticks in the crook
of your thumb and forefinger.

292
00:26:09,682 --> 00:26:12,161
Use your ring finger to lift the chopsticks,

293
00:26:12,161 --> 00:26:14,690
and use your thumb to hold
the chopsticks in place.

294
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:17,051
Then, hold the chopsticks
as if it were a pen,

295
00:26:17,051 --> 00:26:20,514
and keep the two parallel to each other.

296
00:26:20,514 --> 00:26:25,480
Open and close the
chopsticks to pick up food.

297
00:26:55,644 --> 00:26:57,453
I'm hungry.

298
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:03,304
Do I have to know how to use
my chopsticks to be able to eat?

299
00:27:03,304 --> 00:27:06,269
I can still eat even I don't.

300
00:27:07,689 --> 00:27:12,752
Now, please find Honghwamun
Gate inside Changdeok Palace.

301
00:27:12,752 --> 00:27:14,013
Honghwamun Gate?

302
00:27:15,945 --> 00:27:17,776
There...

303
00:27:19,843 --> 00:27:21,101
There!

304
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,378
That's incorrect!

305
00:27:24,378 --> 00:27:28,011
Honghwamun Gate is here.

306
00:27:28,011 --> 00:27:31,938
Oh, there! I was going
to say that's the one!

307
00:27:31,938 --> 00:27:34,037
- Honghwamun Gate...
- Ma'am?

308
00:27:40,276 --> 00:27:42,776
May I speak to you outside?

309
00:27:47,307 --> 00:27:51,260
Your Highness, please wait a moment.

310
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,272
Okay.

311
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:18,629
Oh, Yang Sooneui!

312
00:28:20,363 --> 00:28:22,250
I am Attendant Yang, Your Highness.

313
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,811
Quit playing! Hey!

314
00:28:24,811 --> 00:28:30,520
What? Please don't "Hey" me! Your Highness...

315
00:28:31,099 --> 00:28:33,017
Can I borrow your cell phone?

316
00:28:34,642 --> 00:28:36,843
Why? What happened to yours?

317
00:28:36,843 --> 00:28:39,138
They took it away from me.

318
00:28:39,138 --> 00:28:41,171
I haven't called anybody for a few days.

319
00:28:41,171 --> 00:28:43,427
I need to make an urgent call,
so give it to me!

320
00:28:43,427 --> 00:28:45,987
No! Borrow it from somebody else!

321
00:28:45,987 --> 00:28:48,564
Don't be so stingy!

322
00:28:48,564 --> 00:28:51,064
You weren't this bad in the past!

323
00:28:51,764 --> 00:28:55,212
I can't believe this! Look who's talking!

324
00:28:55,212 --> 00:28:56,929
Give it!

325
00:28:56,929 --> 00:28:57,761
No!

326
00:28:57,761 --> 00:28:59,086
- Give it!
- No!

327
00:28:59,086 --> 00:29:00,465
Give it!

328
00:29:06,415 --> 00:29:09,617
How could you do such a thing?

329
00:29:09,617 --> 00:29:12,088
I didn't do it on purpose.

330
00:29:12,088 --> 00:29:14,261
Yes, you did!

331
00:29:14,261 --> 00:29:18,533
Your hands just touched here!

332
00:29:18,533 --> 00:29:20,079
No, they didn't!

333
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:20,909
Yes, they did!

334
00:29:20,909 --> 00:29:22,062
No, they did not!

335
00:29:22,062 --> 00:29:24,034
Yes, they did, you scumbag!

336
00:29:25,702 --> 00:29:30,379
Whatever. It was an accident anyway.

337
00:29:30,379 --> 00:29:34,307
How can you be so brazen?

338
00:29:34,307 --> 00:29:35,547
Real funny!

339
00:29:35,547 --> 00:29:39,924
You're flat-chested,
so I didn't feel a thing!

340
00:29:39,924 --> 00:29:41,027
For real!

341
00:29:41,027 --> 00:29:45,176
You rascal! You scumbag!

342
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,471
You still trip all the time?

343
00:29:56,603 --> 00:29:58,130
Chuba?

344
00:29:58,806 --> 00:30:00,645
It's me, Hoo.

345
00:30:00,645 --> 00:30:02,346
I know. It just happened.

346
00:30:03,813 --> 00:30:07,200
I'm at the palace! How many
times do I have to tell you?

347
00:30:07,836 --> 00:30:10,692
My bike's at the body shop
right now getting fixed.

348
00:30:10,692 --> 00:30:13,303
And, I have to pick it up today.
Can you pick it up for me?

349
00:30:13,972 --> 00:30:15,784
Okay, kid!

350
00:30:15,784 --> 00:30:17,749
I'm hanging up.

351
00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:24,626
Don't be so stingy over one phone call.

352
00:30:24,626 --> 00:30:25,991
Stingy?

353
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,518
You!

354
00:30:28,518 --> 00:30:29,913
Seriously!

355
00:30:36,718 --> 00:30:42,550
A crown prince is someone
who will inherit the throne.

356
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:49,042
We can't crown someone who's not fit
just because he's of royal blood.

357
00:30:50,438 --> 00:30:58,150
I don't oppose my brother's only child
becoming the Crown Prince.

358
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:03,254
I'm just afraid there'll be
chaos in the palace

359
00:31:03,254 --> 00:31:06,869
when an unfit person gets seated
in an important position,

360
00:31:06,869 --> 00:31:12,142
and cannot carry out his duties...

361
00:31:12,142 --> 00:31:17,179
like my son, Crown Prince Hwemin,
when he died in an accident.

362
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:23,204
Please do not rush things.

363
00:31:23,204 --> 00:31:26,526
It will not be too late to bestow
the Crown Prince title upon him

364
00:31:26,526 --> 00:31:34,163
once he acquires the qualifications
needed for the position.

365
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:40,067
But, would Grand Prince Hyojang
sit back and let it happen?

366
00:31:42,342 --> 00:31:47,766
Uncle, I'm honestly afraid.

367
00:31:47,766 --> 00:31:50,111
When I took over the throne,

368
00:31:50,111 --> 00:31:53,480
I didn't think me being a
woman would be a problem

369
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,258
as long as I gave my all to our country.

370
00:32:00,094 --> 00:32:03,256
But, then what happened?

371
00:32:03,256 --> 00:32:07,674
Even the people inside the palace
attacked me and discriminated against me

372
00:32:07,674 --> 00:32:10,037
because I was a woman.

373
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:16,613
I can't pretend to be understanding
about it anymore.

374
00:32:20,427 --> 00:32:21,637
Uncle!

375
00:32:26,754 --> 00:32:32,117
Do you now understand why I've gotten
all my hopes up about Prince Hoo?

376
00:32:33,082 --> 00:32:35,511
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

377
00:32:38,906 --> 00:32:42,042
I will remember your words.

378
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:45,774
Appointing a crown prince
is an important matter

379
00:32:45,774 --> 00:32:47,567
that involves the future of the Royal Palace.

380
00:32:47,567 --> 00:32:50,810
I will be very careful.

381
00:33:12,302 --> 00:33:17,830
Your Highness, this isn't the time
to just sit back and relax.

382
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:22,486
Introducing Prince Hoo to us
the other night must mean

383
00:33:22,486 --> 00:33:30,207
she's going to reject our petition asking her
to appoint Prince Joon as Crown Prince.

384
00:33:30,207 --> 00:33:37,077
I know the dignity of our Royal Palace isn't
the same ever since we enthroned an empress.

385
00:33:37,077 --> 00:33:39,148
But, we can't just sit back and just
watch that wild boy inherit the throne.

386
00:33:39,148 --> 00:33:42,315
- He's right!
- We must get involved!

387
00:33:42,315 --> 00:33:43,638
Definitely!

388
00:33:44,795 --> 00:33:51,884
The patriotism of you gentlemen
is so true and deep.

389
00:33:51,884 --> 00:33:55,644
How can I possibly go against it?

390
00:33:55,644 --> 00:34:02,248
For the sake of the Royal Palace,
I will leave my son in your hands.

391
00:34:24,308 --> 00:34:25,564
Your Highness,

392
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:29,527
if your father ever finds out about
your doing this dangerous sport...

393
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:32,414
That's why I always ask you for a favor.

394
00:34:32,414 --> 00:34:34,387
You'll keep it a secret, right?

395
00:34:50,952 --> 00:34:53,797
I heard you coughing, so I
brought you some lemonade.

396
00:34:55,647 --> 00:34:58,953
You sometimes act very kind and caring.

397
00:34:58,953 --> 00:35:04,530
People tend to view others the
way they want others to view them.

398
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:06,573
Perhaps you need to warm your heart up a bit?

399
00:35:10,721 --> 00:35:16,297
An unexpected threat has arisen,
yet you don't look nervous at all.

400
00:35:16,297 --> 00:35:18,036
Is it self-confidence or arrogance?

401
00:35:19,104 --> 00:35:20,876
Do I have a reason to be nervous?

402
00:35:21,723 --> 00:35:24,465
You're no longer next in line to be emperor.

403
00:35:24,465 --> 00:35:29,197
That man will become an heir as soon
as the parliament approves it, right?

404
00:35:29,985 --> 00:35:31,295
I guess so.

405
00:35:33,002 --> 00:35:35,409
I think this is an exceptional circumstance.

406
00:35:35,409 --> 00:35:37,244
You need to be a little nervous.

407
00:35:40,121 --> 00:35:43,153
Ever since I was a child,

408
00:35:43,153 --> 00:35:46,008
I was told that there are three very
important aspects of the lives of royalty.

409
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:49,858
Education, sincerity, and dignity.

410
00:35:51,287 --> 00:35:53,965
You can't lack in any of the three.

411
00:35:53,965 --> 00:35:58,474
But of those three, I think dignity is
what makes royalty seem like royalty.

412
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:04,286
The royal family put up with
all the inconveniences

413
00:36:04,286 --> 00:36:06,690
just to maintain their dignity.

414
00:36:07,502 --> 00:36:09,453
That's true.

415
00:36:09,453 --> 00:36:13,298
A delivery boy becoming
a crown prince is kind of absurd.

416
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:25,779
I hope you're the man who
can give me everything I want.

417
00:36:30,046 --> 00:36:33,545
Does your mother in New York
know about our engagement, too?

418
00:36:35,709 --> 00:36:37,896
She's not even interested.

419
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:41,187
She always does whatever she pleases.

420
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:45,754
She probably knows. Don't worry.

421
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,386
Shin Saeryung, freshman-class president,

422
00:36:50,386 --> 00:36:53,771
please report immediately
to the principal's office.

423
00:36:53,771 --> 00:36:56,124
Shin Saeryung, freshman-class president,

424
00:36:56,124 --> 00:36:59,040
please report immediately
to the principal's office.

425
00:37:02,823 --> 00:37:08,239
The Royal Academy is honored to accept
Prince Hoo as one of our students.

426
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:11,934
We'll take care of the enrollment process.

427
00:37:11,934 --> 00:37:14,308
Please do not worry.

428
00:37:14,308 --> 00:37:17,056
And please pass on my words to Her Majesty.

429
00:37:17,871 --> 00:37:20,010
Thank you.

430
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:22,550
I will do that.

431
00:37:28,762 --> 00:37:30,727
Here you are, Saeryung.

432
00:38:01,067 --> 00:38:02,472
Shall we?

433
00:38:02,472 --> 00:38:03,468
Yes.

434
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:17,167
The Royal Academy focuses
on physical education.

435
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:19,088
Such as horseback riding, marksmanship, golf,

436
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:23,256
swimming, fencing, martial arts,
and traditional dance.

437
00:38:23,256 --> 00:38:28,524
In a way, our school offers more physical
activity courses than liberal arts ones.

438
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,231
From this point on is the palace.

439
00:38:44,231 --> 00:38:47,843
On the right is the Academy,
and on the left is the Imperial Palace.

440
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:04,085
This point forward is off limits
to the Academy students.

441
00:39:04,085 --> 00:39:05,621
Why is that?

442
00:39:05,621 --> 00:39:07,190
Just because you're a member
of royalty doesn't mean

443
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:09,879
you can go in and out of
the palace as you wish.

444
00:39:09,879 --> 00:39:12,131
Oh, I see!

445
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:15,940
But, you're allowed to
enter up to this point...

446
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,320
only if you're one of the Academy students.

447
00:39:20,408 --> 00:39:23,961
You can only enter here
when you need to use the library.

448
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:27,477
But, kids always find excuses
to come in here and hang out.

449
00:39:27,477 --> 00:39:29,430
And, why is that?

450
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:34,432
Hmm. Maybe it's because it makes
you feel privileged entering a

451
00:39:34,432 --> 00:39:37,302
place where not everyone can.

452
00:39:37,302 --> 00:39:40,125
Anyway, everyone likes to hang out here.

453
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:44,454
From now on, you'll probably stay
at the House of the Gifted, too.

454
00:39:44,454 --> 00:39:45,843
The House of the Gifted?

455
00:39:46,893 --> 00:39:50,202
It's a place where the country's
young geniuses gather.

456
00:39:50,202 --> 00:39:51,754
I see.

457
00:39:51,754 --> 00:39:56,104
You're not going to ignore me
if I come looking for you, are you?

458
00:39:56,834 --> 00:39:58,192
Of course not!

459
00:40:05,468 --> 00:40:07,000
Which way do I go now?

460
00:40:24,606 --> 00:40:28,208
[Racquetball Room / Cafe Terrace /
Art Studio / Golf Course / Science Lab]

461
00:40:45,924 --> 00:40:47,816
It's not here.

462
00:40:49,291 --> 00:40:52,532
I'm going to go crazy!

463
00:40:52,532 --> 00:40:54,729
How did you find this spot?

464
00:40:55,935 --> 00:40:57,626
I see it! I see it!

465
00:40:58,185 --> 00:41:03,062
She's hot! She's got beautiful curves!

466
00:41:03,062 --> 00:41:07,226
Sexiness is not something you can create,
but something you're born with.

467
00:41:07,226 --> 00:41:11,154
Oh, she's maturing into a woman.

468
00:41:11,154 --> 00:41:14,262
Like a flower that's about to bloom!

469
00:41:18,219 --> 00:41:22,362
I can still see it no matter how hard
they try to hide it with a school uniform.

470
00:41:22,362 --> 00:41:24,980
- Women must have...
- Boobs.

471
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,718
And also a sexy butt!

472
00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:29,407
You can't overlook that!

473
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,148
Did you see that?

474
00:41:32,148 --> 00:41:33,192
Yup!

475
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:36,671
- That girl is really...
- She's hot!

476
00:41:36,671 --> 00:41:38,760
Isn't she hot?

477
00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:41,328
She's really hot!

478
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,489
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

479
00:41:47,562 --> 00:41:49,126
Who are you?

480
00:41:50,443 --> 00:41:52,550
What was that? Who's there?

481
00:41:53,905 --> 00:41:55,866
Who is he?

482
00:42:07,685 --> 00:42:08,320
What the heck!

483
00:42:14,129 --> 00:42:17,904
[Prince Hours]

484
00:42:53,632 --> 00:42:55,390
Your Highness!

485
00:43:00,937 --> 00:43:01,437
Here.

486
00:43:13,598 --> 00:43:14,677
Hey!

487
00:43:14,677 --> 00:43:16,386
Hurry up and run!

488
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,822
Ouch! Ah...

489
00:43:33,318 --> 00:43:36,202
Huh? Why doesn't this thing work?

490
00:43:39,279 --> 00:43:43,442
Oh, this one is the latest model.

491
00:43:46,597 --> 00:43:48,233
A call is coming in!

492
00:43:49,868 --> 00:43:52,462
Boyfriend, did you order black-bean noodles?
Did you order black-bean noodles?

493
00:43:55,886 --> 00:43:57,187
Hello!

494
00:43:57,797 --> 00:43:59,112
Hello?

495
00:43:59,112 --> 00:44:03,358
You should say something
when you pick up your phone.

496
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:04,941
Yes?

497
00:44:04,941 --> 00:44:06,714
Is this The Palace?

498
00:44:10,692 --> 00:44:12,716
Hello, is it?

499
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:16,021
Yes, this is the palace.

500
00:44:16,021 --> 00:44:18,754
This is Honey Soju Bar at dock 3.

501
00:44:18,754 --> 00:44:23,791
Bring us 1, 2, 3, no 4 black-bean,
spicy-seafood-noodle soup combos.

502
00:44:23,791 --> 00:44:25,689
Black-bean noodles?

503
00:44:25,689 --> 00:44:27,541
How dare you...

504
00:44:29,727 --> 00:44:32,123
Why are you so slow?

505
00:44:34,096 --> 00:44:38,388
Your Highness, Young Prince Joon has arrived.

506
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:42,603
Let him in.

507
00:44:55,279 --> 00:44:57,779
I don't think this is the latest model.

508
00:44:58,882 --> 00:45:00,026
Really?

509
00:45:01,552 --> 00:45:07,387
But, it seems to have the ability to
show you to whom you're talking.

510
00:45:12,527 --> 00:45:18,007
By the way, Prince Hoo will be
attending the Academy soon.

511
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:20,828
I hope you will look out for him.

512
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,578
Certainly. I will do all
that I can to help him.

513
00:45:26,578 --> 00:45:28,631
Yes, of course.

514
00:45:31,332 --> 00:45:36,072
I really wish Prince Hoo
was half as good as you.

515
00:45:54,069 --> 00:45:55,815
Argh, my knees!

516
00:45:55,815 --> 00:45:58,318
If I keep doing this, I'll get arthritis.

517
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:02,728
Why are there even rules
and regulations to mopping the floor?

518
00:46:02,728 --> 00:46:04,544
Look! What is this?

519
00:46:04,544 --> 00:46:08,760
We should just use a mop or machine.

520
00:46:13,141 --> 00:46:15,115
I'm tired!

521
00:46:15,115 --> 00:46:17,629
We won't be able to finish this
even if we stay up all night.

522
00:46:18,434 --> 00:46:22,238
When will we become the
more privileged court ladies?

523
00:46:35,763 --> 00:46:37,077
Get up!

524
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:39,198
Why?

525
00:46:53,402 --> 00:46:54,941
Ta-da!

526
00:46:55,675 --> 00:46:59,366
Yang Sooneui takes the lead!

527
00:47:04,147 --> 00:47:06,496
Can you do this?

528
00:47:07,404 --> 00:47:08,402
Watch this!

529
00:47:08,402 --> 00:47:10,934
I can do this!

530
00:47:11,976 --> 00:47:13,854
Yeah, right!

531
00:47:21,497 --> 00:47:25,274
Did you hear Prince Hoo
got into trouble the other day?

532
00:47:25,274 --> 00:47:26,697
What trouble?

533
00:47:26,697 --> 00:47:30,041
Big, big trouble!

534
00:47:30,041 --> 00:47:35,249
He got caught peeping into the
girls' locker room at the Academy.

535
00:47:35,249 --> 00:47:37,609
What? Is he out of his mind?

536
00:47:37,609 --> 00:47:40,870
Anyway, he turned the academy upside down.

537
00:47:42,337 --> 00:47:45,063
Attendant Yang! Attendant Ma!

538
00:47:46,473 --> 00:47:48,849
How long have you two been palace attendants?

539
00:47:48,849 --> 00:47:51,521
How could you be so careless and negligent?

540
00:47:51,521 --> 00:47:56,098
How could you call yourselves
court ladies if you act like that?

541
00:47:56,098 --> 00:47:59,375
Take out the Code of Conduct card
and read it a hundred times.

542
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:01,182
And think of its meaning.

543
00:48:01,182 --> 00:48:03,263
A hundred times?

544
00:48:03,263 --> 00:48:04,594
Now!

545
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:12,159
"Your mouth can lead you to trouble.
Your tongue is a sword that can hurt people.

546
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:14,926
If you shut your mouth and keep
your tongue deep inside,

547
00:48:14,926 --> 00:48:18,339
there will be peace
and solidity at all times.

548
00:48:18,339 --> 00:48:24,129
If this happens again in the future,
you two will be reprimanded and disciplined!

549
00:48:25,379 --> 00:48:26,727
Keep reading.

550
00:48:31,637 --> 00:48:36,584
"Your mouth can lead you to trouble.
Your tongue is a sword that can hurt people."

551
00:48:37,351 --> 00:48:40,072
I feel like my lips are numb!

552
00:48:42,036 --> 00:48:44,252
So whatever happened
to the prince afterward?

553
00:48:44,252 --> 00:48:47,612
I'm sure he got a good scolding. How
can someone who's royalty do such a thing?

554
00:48:47,612 --> 00:48:49,524
Anyway, he's got so many problems.

555
00:48:49,524 --> 00:48:51,284
He's the prince of problems!

556
00:48:51,284 --> 00:48:53,323
What an idiot! Serves him right!

557
00:48:53,323 --> 00:48:56,842
You don't seem to like him much. Why is that?

558
00:48:56,842 --> 00:48:59,915
He just looks so arrogant and rude.

559
00:49:02,732 --> 00:49:03,232
Ah.

560
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:13,543
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

561
00:49:13,543 --> 00:49:16,632
I'm truly sorry.

562
00:49:16,632 --> 00:49:18,799
I am very, very sorry!

563
00:49:18,799 --> 00:49:20,558
Please forgive me!

564
00:49:23,216 --> 00:49:26,420
Isn't this something precious
to court ladies?

565
00:49:27,056 --> 00:49:28,670
Please forgive me.

566
00:49:31,351 --> 00:49:32,860
[Code of Conduct Card]

567
00:49:34,473 --> 00:49:37,939
Oh, no! I think you have a bump!

568
00:49:37,939 --> 00:49:40,324
You must be in pain.

569
00:49:40,324 --> 00:49:43,480
I'll go to the Royal Infirmary
and get some medicine.

570
00:49:44,347 --> 00:49:45,805
- It's okay.
- Pardon?

571
00:49:47,641 --> 00:49:49,513
If you like me, just say so.

572
00:49:49,513 --> 00:49:51,722
I don't want this sort of
an overly intense expression of love.

573
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:52,846
Pardon?

574
00:49:54,796 --> 00:49:56,825
You've troubled me twice already.

575
00:49:56,825 --> 00:49:58,609
How are you going to make it up to me?

576
00:49:58,609 --> 00:50:02,357
Pardon? Well...

577
00:50:20,376 --> 00:50:22,738
Thank you for your hard work, Your Highness.

578
00:50:22,738 --> 00:50:23,881
Okay.

579
00:50:28,834 --> 00:50:31,415
Are they trying to kill me?

580
00:50:34,188 --> 00:50:37,233
Do not go to department
stores to buy clothes...

581
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:48,202
Who did such a nice thing?

582
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:57,234
Your Highness, the Grand
Chamberlain has arrived.

583
00:51:09,854 --> 00:51:13,483
Your Highness! Your Highness!

584
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,548
I'll have to tell Her Majesty you're asleep.

585
00:51:20,576 --> 00:51:22,202
Were you looking for me?

586
00:51:31,214 --> 00:51:32,940
Your Highness,

587
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:38,500
There will be a special lecture
and an evaluation tomorrow morning.

588
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:42,837
Pardon? What special lecture?

589
00:51:42,837 --> 00:51:44,452
What evaluation?

590
00:51:44,452 --> 00:51:49,852
Her Majesty will personally be
attending the lecture tomorrow.

591
00:51:49,852 --> 00:51:53,328
And you'll be examined on the
material you were taught...

592
00:51:53,328 --> 00:51:57,600
Wait! You mean like a test?

593
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,073
Yes, Your Highness.

594
00:51:59,073 --> 00:52:03,573
So, I suggest you study
before you go to bed tonight.

595
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:07,182
Oh, no, I'm dead!

596
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,488
Yongnam, can you answer my phone?

597
00:52:34,488 --> 00:52:36,397
I'm in the bathroom...

598
00:52:37,778 --> 00:52:39,139
Again?

599
00:52:52,184 --> 00:52:53,610
Hello?

600
00:52:54,816 --> 00:52:57,560
What? Kang Hoo?

601
00:52:58,486 --> 00:53:01,030
He's not here.

602
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:03,338
What? It's a matter of life or death?

603
00:53:03,789 --> 00:53:05,998
What's going on?

604
00:53:05,998 --> 00:53:09,669
We just left the palace.
Why do you have to go back in?

605
00:53:09,669 --> 00:53:12,869
My life gets all twisted
whenever he shows up.

606
00:53:12,869 --> 00:53:14,250
Who?

607
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:21,436
- I will take this with me.
- For what?

608
00:53:21,436 --> 00:53:23,613
I have to have a reason to enter the palace!

609
00:53:50,554 --> 00:53:51,990
Your Highness!

610
00:53:53,594 --> 00:53:55,136
Your Highness!

611
00:54:03,058 --> 00:54:04,222
Hey!

612
00:54:05,802 --> 00:54:07,831
Kang Hoo!

613
00:54:08,842 --> 00:54:09,978
Hey!

614
00:54:09,978 --> 00:54:13,497
Why are you in my dream?

615
00:54:14,306 --> 00:54:16,192
This is not a dream.

616
00:54:16,192 --> 00:54:18,710
Oh, what are you doing here?

617
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:20,661
Do you think I wanted to come?

618
00:54:21,177 --> 00:54:23,754
Huh? What's with that plant?

619
00:54:23,754 --> 00:54:24,969
Is that for me?

620
00:54:24,969 --> 00:54:27,823
You wish! This was just an excuse.

621
00:54:30,883 --> 00:54:33,395
Someone called from Incheon.
He said it was urgent.

622
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:34,504
Call him!

623
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:35,907
What is it?

624
00:54:35,907 --> 00:54:37,434
How am I supposed to know?

625
00:54:37,434 --> 00:54:39,265
You came here this late to tell me this?

626
00:54:40,267 --> 00:54:43,421
He said it's a matter of life or death!

627
00:54:43,421 --> 00:54:46,286
You're so hopeless!

628
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:47,818
So are you!

629
00:54:48,686 --> 00:54:53,123
Hello, Chuba?

630
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,238
What?

631
00:54:55,378 --> 00:54:57,008
Bulbam?

632
00:54:57,795 --> 00:54:59,583
That punk!

633
00:55:00,667 --> 00:55:01,832
Okay.

634
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:08,023
Is something wrong?

635
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:23,047
- Hey!
- Yes?

636
00:55:23,047 --> 00:55:24,934
You're going to stand there?

637
00:55:24,934 --> 00:55:25,954
No.

638
00:55:34,193 --> 00:55:37,433
But, why are you changing?

639
00:55:37,433 --> 00:55:40,268
It's a matter of life or death.
I have to get out of here.

640
00:55:40,268 --> 00:55:41,226
What?

641
00:55:41,226 --> 00:55:44,004
You saw it, didn't you?

642
00:55:44,004 --> 00:55:46,147
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did!

643
00:55:46,147 --> 00:55:48,412
I guess you're a woman after all.

644
00:55:48,412 --> 00:55:49,544
What?

645
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:53,128
Now that this has happened, we're even now!

646
00:55:53,786 --> 00:55:58,302
Hey... your zipper is down.

647
00:55:58,302 --> 00:55:59,372
What?

648
00:56:00,295 --> 00:56:02,196
How embarrassing!

649
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:07,729
Are you going to run away?

650
00:56:07,729 --> 00:56:11,305
I'm not running away.
I'm coming back in a while.

651
00:56:11,305 --> 00:56:12,809
Did you get permission?

652
00:56:12,809 --> 00:56:13,917
Forget it!

653
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:18,866
Anyway, help me!

654
00:56:18,866 --> 00:56:22,345
Help you with what? Help you run away?

655
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:25,075
No way! If I get caught, I'll get fired.

656
00:56:25,075 --> 00:56:26,689
It's not like you're running away with me!

657
00:56:26,689 --> 00:56:28,173
Just help me!

658
00:56:28,173 --> 00:56:30,157
I said no!

659
00:56:30,157 --> 00:56:32,421
Why should I help you?

660
00:56:32,421 --> 00:56:34,546
It's a matter of life or death! Okay?

661
00:56:34,546 --> 00:56:35,858
I will come back soon.

662
00:56:35,858 --> 00:56:38,714
If anything happens to you,
I will take full responsibility.

663
00:56:38,714 --> 00:56:42,178
Yeah, right. There's no way.

664
00:56:42,178 --> 00:56:45,273
Come on, help me!

665
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:54,620
[Prince Hours]

666
00:57:42,978 --> 00:57:46,050
Can't you just ask them if you could leave?

667
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:48,927
If that were possible, I wouldn't
be here right now, would I?

668
00:57:53,172 --> 00:58:00,426
A vegetable delivery truck is parked
behind that building right now.

669
00:58:00,426 --> 00:58:03,291
It's going to leave soon, so hurry.

670
00:58:03,291 --> 00:58:05,832
If you get caught, I'm dead meat!

671
00:58:05,832 --> 00:58:07,160
Am I going alone?

672
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,642
Of course. You expect me to go with you?

673
00:58:09,642 --> 00:58:11,188
Let's go together!

674
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:16,344
But, how do I get there?

675
00:58:16,344 --> 00:58:18,052
What do you mean how?

676
00:58:19,354 --> 00:58:21,562
- You have to jump off!
- What?

677
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:27,179
I can't! I'm afraid of heights.

678
00:58:27,925 --> 00:58:31,968
Hey! Are you kidding me right now?

679
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:35,187
Fine! Move!

680
00:58:42,688 --> 00:58:44,091
I can't do it!

681
00:58:45,139 --> 00:58:47,695
You're unbelievable! Move!

682
00:59:06,922 --> 00:59:09,885
Ahhh! That hurts!

683
00:59:09,885 --> 00:59:12,847
- Are you okay?
- It hurts!

684
00:59:12,847 --> 00:59:14,345
Let me see!

685
00:59:14,345 --> 00:59:15,481
Forget it!

686
00:59:15,481 --> 00:59:17,408
Let me see!

687
00:59:18,739 --> 00:59:20,392
That looks painful.

688
00:59:23,387 --> 00:59:24,832
Are you okay?

689
00:59:25,843 --> 00:59:28,923
Forget it! It's all because of you!

690
00:59:28,923 --> 00:59:31,726
I didn't do it on purpose! Let me see!

691
00:59:37,858 --> 00:59:39,335
You're fine!

692
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:05,482
That's the truck?

693
01:00:06,544 --> 01:00:07,936
Yes.

694
01:00:07,936 --> 01:00:10,195
It's going to make me look really uncool!

695
01:01:54,097 --> 01:01:55,167
[Prince Hours]

696
01:01:55,167 --> 01:01:56,991
Where were you?

697
01:01:56,991 --> 01:01:59,766
I told you I was in the
palace with the Empress!

698
01:01:59,766 --> 01:02:01,894
Were you in the hospital by chance?

699
01:02:01,894 --> 01:02:04,120
It appears he has escaped on his own will.

700
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,975
According to these snapshots
from the security cameras,

701
01:02:06,975 --> 01:02:09,895
a palace attendant must've helped him.

702
01:02:09,895 --> 01:02:13,279
You know me, the legendary 17 against 1!

703
01:02:13,279 --> 01:02:14,770
He's in a rage right now!

704
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:17,570
He's not Bulbam. He's "Bul-bomb!"

705
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:20,480
Did something happen to His Highness?

706
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:25,137
I'm a prince, and my grandfather
is Emperor Hunchin!

707
01:02:25,137 --> 01:02:27,960
I've been in the palace
for the last two days!

708
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:32,545
Kang Hoo! You're such a nuisance!

709
01:02:32,545 --> 01:02:34,009
You royal loser!

710
01:02:34,009 --> 01:02:35,292
Worthless piece of crap!

711
01:02:35,292 --> 01:02:37,561
You need to take responsibility for me!

712
01:02:37,561 --> 01:02:39,153
Are you asking me to marry you?

713
01:02:39,153 --> 01:02:41,080
I can't do that.

714
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,824
I'd rather die.

715
01:02:42,824 --> 01:02:45,401
I can arrest you for trespassing

716
01:02:45,401 --> 01:02:46,836
and hand you over to the police!

717
01:02:46,836 --> 01:02:49,226
Why do you want me
to get engaged so soon?

718
01:02:49,226 --> 01:02:53,033
The Imperial Court is in
Grand Prince Hyojang's hands.

719
01:02:53,033 --> 01:02:56,073
I want to wait and see who holds the ace.

720
01:02:56,073 --> 01:02:57,810
You're such a coward!

721
01:02:57,810 --> 01:03:01,590
You don't deserve the people's respect!
