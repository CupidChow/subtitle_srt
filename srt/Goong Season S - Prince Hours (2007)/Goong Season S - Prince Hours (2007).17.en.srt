1
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:14,845
There's going to be
a special council meeting?

2
00:00:14,887 --> 00:00:18,845
Yes, Your Majesty. The four Royal Kin who

3
00:00:18,887 --> 00:00:24,804
side with Grand Prince Hyojang
demanded a special Council meeting.

4
00:00:24,845 --> 00:00:31,346
But, there are only two
more assignments left.

5
00:00:31,388 --> 00:00:33,469
Please help him, Prime Minister Shin.

6
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:35,929
We can postpone the council.

7
00:00:35,929 --> 00:00:41,804
Yes, we can decide after
evaluating the remaining assignments.

8
00:00:41,845 --> 00:00:47,929
Since I just came into office,
I don't have much power.

9
00:00:47,971 --> 00:00:51,929
We'll be grateful if you help us.

10
00:00:51,971 --> 00:00:56,845
But, then again, my daughter
asked me to help him as well.

11
00:00:56,887 --> 00:01:01,595
Saeryung did?

12
00:01:01,637 --> 00:01:09,260
This can bring those two closer together.

13
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:14,145
My father will do something about this.

14
00:01:15,692 --> 00:01:18,059
So, don't worry about this.

15
00:01:20,388 --> 00:01:24,304
You and your father are
always doing me a favor.

16
00:01:24,346 --> 00:01:28,595
I enjoy helping Your Highness.

17
00:01:28,637 --> 00:01:34,512
I had no idea helping someone
can make you feel so fulfilled.

18
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:45,179
Ah, you're here early.

19
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:51,179
I came here to give my regards to
Her Majesty and heard you were here.

20
00:01:52,595 --> 00:01:55,512
You postponed the Royal Council meeting.

21
00:01:55,553 --> 00:01:57,096
As you know,

22
00:01:57,137 --> 00:02:00,720
the Prime Minister has the authority to
open or postpone the cabinet meeting.

23
00:02:00,762 --> 00:02:04,096
Even so, isn't this extremely arbitrary

24
00:02:04,137 --> 00:02:08,429
when the reason for the meeting is valid?

25
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:12,346
You say its arbitrary, but it isn't so.

26
00:02:12,346 --> 00:02:17,469
In looking into the matter, there is a fault
with the candidacy-qualification argument.

27
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:18,971
What do you mean?

28
00:02:18,971 --> 00:02:22,346
According to Imperial Law
Article 5, Section 12,

29
00:02:22,388 --> 00:02:28,469
"A royal whose special rights have
been revoked does not need

30
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:34,929
to fulfill the responsibilities
or duties entrusted to him."

31
00:02:34,971 --> 00:02:40,679
In other words, Prince Youngsung is
nothing more than a candidate now

32
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,971
that he's not a Regent anymore.

33
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:50,262
There is no law that forbids
him from leaving the palace.

34
00:02:50,262 --> 00:02:55,595
You'll be punished if you cross me like this.

35
00:02:55,637 --> 00:02:58,804
I don't appreciate hearing that from you.

36
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,971
Prime Minister Shin!

37
00:03:02,012 --> 00:03:07,637
If you turn your back on me,
you'll have to pay.

38
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:12,595
Then, you should've been more careful.

39
00:03:20,512 --> 00:03:22,387
I only did what I was supposed to do.

40
00:03:22,387 --> 00:03:25,643
But, you helped me and I
want to pay my gratitude back.

41
00:03:25,643 --> 00:03:29,041
Come with Hoo. Please, take my invitation.

42
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,469
Okay, I will.

43
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:35,716
Then, I will see you this evening. Bye.

44
00:03:47,971 --> 00:03:51,553
Yang Sooneui!

45
00:03:51,553 --> 00:03:53,137
You're already here?

46
00:03:53,137 --> 00:03:56,262
Of course. I don't want to waste a second.

47
00:03:56,262 --> 00:03:58,469
Let's go!

48
00:04:38,429 --> 00:04:40,429
Really?

49
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:44,512
You should go if you're invited.

50
00:04:44,553 --> 00:04:48,470
That means I can be
with you until nighttime.

51
00:04:56,595 --> 00:05:00,637
Are you sure you can be out like this?

52
00:05:00,637 --> 00:05:02,553
I got permission.

53
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:07,720
I'll be seeing less of you when
the competition starts again.

54
00:05:07,762 --> 00:05:11,720
There are many things I want to do
with you before that happens.

55
00:05:11,762 --> 00:05:15,637
I'll do everything I couldn't
do for you until now.

56
00:05:19,595 --> 00:05:23,679
Don't even think about running away.

57
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,221
I'm holding you as hostage.

58
00:05:26,262 --> 00:05:28,304
Says who?

59
00:05:28,346 --> 00:05:30,012
Says me.

60
00:05:35,804 --> 00:05:40,054
Do you have to be his study buddy?

61
00:05:40,054 --> 00:05:43,887
I don't want you to do it.

62
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:47,137
You have a study buddy, too.

63
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:50,388
I had no choice because
Her Majesty made me do it.

64
00:05:50,429 --> 00:05:51,637
You could've said no.

65
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:55,971
The Empress Dowager made me do it, too.

66
00:05:56,012 --> 00:06:00,221
The Imperial Court is paying for my tuition.

67
00:06:00,262 --> 00:06:02,470
I can't say no.

68
00:06:02,512 --> 00:06:04,096
If they tell me to do it, I have to do it...

69
00:06:04,137 --> 00:06:06,181
If you had said no, what
would they have done?

70
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:12,137
I'm just saying you should
speak your mind. Got it?

71
00:06:13,512 --> 00:06:17,595
It bothers me.

72
00:06:17,637 --> 00:06:22,388
Oh, my. You're so jealous.

73
00:06:22,429 --> 00:06:24,679
It's not jealousy. It's instinct.

74
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,679
What?

75
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:33,720
No man would want his girl to be
together in a room with another man.

76
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:39,137
I'm not your girl.

77
00:06:39,137 --> 00:06:40,720
I know you like it.

78
00:06:44,262 --> 00:06:48,469
They're so cool... don't you think?

79
00:06:50,429 --> 00:06:51,637
Not at all...

80
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:54,637
Why? I think they're good.

81
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:56,553
It looks fun.

82
00:06:56,595 --> 00:06:59,470
Want to give it a try?

83
00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:13,223
- Don't let go!
- I won't.

84
00:07:13,223 --> 00:07:14,571
- You can't let go!
- Okay.

85
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:16,866
- Slow down.
- Wow!

86
00:07:16,929 --> 00:07:19,096
Don't push me! Don't push me!

87
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:42,221
From Daeyeon Elementary School?

88
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:43,637
Sixth grade, Classroom 6?

89
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:45,054
Kang Hoo?

90
00:09:08,469 --> 00:09:11,553
I heard Attendant Yang is
now your study buddy.

91
00:09:11,595 --> 00:09:14,470
I wonder how she can help you.

92
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:21,429
I just wanted her to be by my side.

93
00:09:21,469 --> 00:09:24,179
You're too honest.
I don't know what to say.

94
00:09:24,221 --> 00:09:27,637
How about you?

95
00:09:27,637 --> 00:09:31,429
Are you getting what you want?

96
00:09:31,429 --> 00:09:36,137
I want you to be more aggressive.

97
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:40,971
My father told me the Empress
Dowager has made up her mind.

98
00:09:44,512 --> 00:09:47,469
What we saw at the burial site
doesn't change anything.

99
00:09:47,469 --> 00:09:53,512
Prince Youngsung's feelings...
I think I can turn it around.

100
00:09:53,553 --> 00:09:56,262
Help me.

101
00:09:56,304 --> 00:10:02,137
You'll get what you want by helping me.

102
00:10:02,137 --> 00:10:05,553
I'm surprised.

103
00:10:05,553 --> 00:10:09,887
I never expected you to talk
about moving someone's heart.

104
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:14,470
I think I now know what
it feels to like someone,

105
00:10:14,512 --> 00:10:19,679
and why you can't let Attendant Yang
go even though she doesn't like you.

106
00:10:21,553 --> 00:10:29,553
Longing for someone I can't have is so cruel.

107
00:10:30,637 --> 00:10:35,469
It's getting harder and harder.

108
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:40,221
I want you to get engaged soon, too.

109
00:10:40,221 --> 00:10:42,679
Tell me if there's anything
you need me to do.

110
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,679
I'll do my best to help you.

111
00:10:58,221 --> 00:10:59,469
The pig!

112
00:10:59,469 --> 00:11:01,179
The pig?

113
00:11:01,221 --> 00:11:02,470
Oink oink?

114
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,469
He only invited us two?

115
00:11:13,469 --> 00:11:15,762
I think so.

116
00:11:15,804 --> 00:11:18,971
It'll be great if Her Majesty can join us.

117
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,553
It must be tough for both of them.

118
00:11:22,595 --> 00:11:27,304
They want to be together, but they can't.

119
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,469
Why don't we get that?

120
00:11:40,469 --> 00:11:42,469
I'll take this.

121
00:11:48,231 --> 00:11:49,725
No, we don't candles.

122
00:11:50,595 --> 00:11:54,257
- Do you also need poppers?
- No, that's okay.

123
00:11:55,305 --> 00:11:56,999
It's $15.

124
00:12:02,512 --> 00:12:05,595
Hello, Eunuch Kwak.

125
00:12:05,637 --> 00:12:09,469
I think I'll be home late... Yes...

126
00:12:09,469 --> 00:12:11,595
Please also relay that to Lady Han.

127
00:12:12,535 --> 00:12:13,035
Yes.

128
00:12:14,595 --> 00:12:16,179
Look at that cell phone!

129
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:16,762
I think he's a royal.

130
00:12:16,762 --> 00:12:18,720
You're right.

131
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,637
He looks familiar.

132
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:22,835
I think he's Prince Yi Hoo.

133
00:12:22,835 --> 00:12:24,603
Hey, let's hurry and go see!

134
00:12:29,012 --> 00:12:31,262
- Are you Prince Yi Hoo?
- You are, aren't you?

135
00:12:31,262 --> 00:12:33,575
- Oh boy!
- I can't believe it!

136
00:12:47,096 --> 00:12:48,469
See?

137
00:12:48,469 --> 00:12:53,469
I told you we should avoid crowded places.

138
00:12:53,469 --> 00:12:56,720
This is inconvenient, isn't it?

139
00:12:56,762 --> 00:12:59,221
I'm sorry.

140
00:12:59,262 --> 00:13:01,512
It's okay.

141
00:13:01,553 --> 00:13:04,762
Bear with me here.

142
00:13:04,804 --> 00:13:07,469
Don't pay attention to anything else.

143
00:13:07,469 --> 00:13:10,720
Just follow me.

144
00:13:10,762 --> 00:13:17,096
Promise me you'll never run away,
no matter what others say.

145
00:13:29,512 --> 00:13:32,845
Don't ever let go of my hand.

146
00:13:48,356 --> 00:13:51,332
[Prince Hours]

147
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:12,637
I'm disappointed we couldn't get
anything out of her in Africa.

148
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:17,887
They met in an official ceremony in Europe,

149
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:23,512
but I'm sure they met discreetly in Africa.

150
00:14:23,553 --> 00:14:27,679
Maybe she's protecting herself.

151
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:29,887
Maybe they broke up.

152
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:33,096
I don't think so.

153
00:14:33,096 --> 00:14:38,429
The more obstacles they have,
the fonder they'll be of each other.

154
00:14:38,469 --> 00:14:45,637
I told Lady Yoo to be on her guard
so that she won't miss a single detail.

155
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:50,637
We'll have to wait then.

156
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:53,553
Let's wait.

157
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:02,012
You need to hurry, Your Majesty.

158
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:07,469
I'll be there soon.

159
00:15:12,553 --> 00:15:18,679
I left it on the desk inside the red folder.

160
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,720
Give it to him and get me
his reply if you can.

161
00:15:24,762 --> 00:15:27,971
The court ladies and attendants
will rotate shifts in 30 minutes.

162
00:15:28,012 --> 00:15:31,429
The room will be empty for 10 minutes.

163
00:15:31,469 --> 00:15:34,012
Don't let anyone see you.

164
00:15:34,012 --> 00:15:36,512
I understand, Your Majesty.

165
00:15:36,512 --> 00:15:39,470
Don't worry, and enjoy your trip.

166
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:27,401
- Well done.
- Thank you.

167
00:17:40,805 --> 00:17:42,990
I'm sorry for the trouble.

168
00:17:44,388 --> 00:17:48,971
- Sorry.
- Not at all, Professor.

169
00:17:48,971 --> 00:17:53,346
But, things are looking bad.

170
00:17:53,346 --> 00:17:59,469
I don't think you should see
or call Her Majesty for now.

171
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:06,553
Only exchange letters through me,
except for unusual circumstances.

172
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:08,762
I will do so, Madam Chamberlain.

173
00:18:08,762 --> 00:18:15,137
Her Majesty wanted your reply.

174
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:16,762
Is it possible?

175
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:22,196
Yes, please allow me a moment.
I will have it ready immediately.

176
00:18:22,196 --> 00:18:25,858
We have taken pictures together
in Africa without anyone noticing us.

177
00:18:25,858 --> 00:18:30,584
She would love to see those pictures.
I will have them with the letter.

178
00:18:31,971 --> 00:18:35,470
Professor.

179
00:18:35,512 --> 00:18:39,887
Thank you for the gift you got for me.

180
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:43,399
You mean the bell of luck.

181
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,469
What was the apartment number again?

182
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,762
He must be waiting for us.

183
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:05,469
- Huh?
- What's wrong'?

184
00:19:05,469 --> 00:19:08,845
Over there.

185
00:19:08,887 --> 00:19:12,429
It's Madam Chamberlain.

186
00:19:24,512 --> 00:19:26,346
Give me your bag!

187
00:19:26,346 --> 00:19:28,887
If you do, I'll let you live.

188
00:19:29,346 --> 00:19:30,887
No!

189
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:32,512
No!

190
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,469
What are you doing?

191
00:19:37,512 --> 00:19:39,221
Move!

192
00:19:40,469 --> 00:19:42,595
Help her!

193
00:19:54,221 --> 00:19:56,469
No!

194
00:20:06,137 --> 00:20:07,262
Stop!

195
00:20:10,553 --> 00:20:12,137
Stop!

196
00:20:14,262 --> 00:20:15,470
Kang Hoo!

197
00:20:16,553 --> 00:20:20,595
No!

198
00:20:22,762 --> 00:20:24,346
Stop!

199
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,595
I should've been more careful.

200
00:20:42,637 --> 00:20:45,553
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

201
00:20:45,595 --> 00:20:49,845
I'm just glad you're okay.

202
00:20:49,887 --> 00:20:52,595
I should've sent the Royal
Guard Captain with you.

203
00:20:52,637 --> 00:20:56,012
This is my fault.

204
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,679
Captain.

205
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,304
Yes, Your Majesty.

206
00:20:59,346 --> 00:21:05,637
Find out discreetly who attacked
Madam Chamberlain.

207
00:21:05,637 --> 00:21:08,469
Yes, Your Majesty.

208
00:21:12,346 --> 00:21:18,179
I saw a familiar face among those
who attacked Madam Chamberlain.

209
00:21:18,221 --> 00:21:23,595
Have you seen the woman who always
walks behind Grand Prince Hyojang?

210
00:21:23,637 --> 00:21:31,637
I saw that woman while I ran
after the paparazzi as well.

211
00:21:32,054 --> 00:21:34,637
Is that true?

212
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:37,012
Yes.

213
00:21:37,054 --> 00:21:43,512
Grand Prince Hyojang was trying to get me.

214
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:46,096
Captain, put her on the wanted list.

215
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,388
Yes, Your Majesty.

216
00:22:30,469 --> 00:22:35,553
I can't believe you couldn't even take
a letter from Madam Chamberlain.

217
00:22:38,553 --> 00:22:44,137
I didn't know Prince Youngsung would show up.

218
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:46,679
I'm sorry, my lord.

219
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:49,595
Do you know who took the letter?

220
00:22:49,595 --> 00:22:52,553
Not yet.

221
00:22:52,553 --> 00:22:59,012
Who could've found out
about our plan and ruined it?

222
00:22:59,054 --> 00:23:03,469
This wouldn't have happened if you
had taken the letter in the first place.

223
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:15,762
Now that he's seen your face,
you should stay in hiding for now.

224
00:23:15,804 --> 00:23:19,469
Madam Chamberlain...

225
00:23:19,469 --> 00:23:23,137
So she's the Empress' messenger.

226
00:23:41,346 --> 00:23:45,469
Your Highness, we have a message
from Her Majesty's Office.

227
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,054
Her Majesty's personal letter to

228
00:23:47,096 --> 00:23:51,762
the Helvetian Royal Family
disappeared last night.

229
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,637
What?

230
00:23:54,637 --> 00:23:57,595
Who dares to take Her Majesty's letter?

231
00:24:01,637 --> 00:24:03,429
You know what?

232
00:24:03,469 --> 00:24:07,388
I must talk to the Empress right away.

233
00:24:11,595 --> 00:24:18,762
The Royal Investigative Commission
is working on the case.

234
00:24:18,804 --> 00:24:20,595
Don't worry.

235
00:24:20,637 --> 00:24:27,137
Your Majesty, I don't think
this is a simple matter.

236
00:24:27,137 --> 00:24:32,469
I think this is an inside job.

237
00:24:32,469 --> 00:24:37,429
You're right.

238
00:24:37,469 --> 00:24:45,469
Who else would dare to walk inside
Her Majesty's office to steal the letter?

239
00:24:49,469 --> 00:24:54,469
What do you think, Grand Prince Hyojang?

240
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:57,301
Yes, I had this thought.

241
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:06,469
For the 5th task on Courage, why don't we let
the two Princes take on this investigation?

242
00:25:06,469 --> 00:25:11,429
You want to test their courage
through the investigation?

243
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:14,469
That's right.

244
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:22,470
We can't place the two Princes in
physical danger to test their courage.

245
00:25:22,804 --> 00:25:30,137
I think we should take a
different approach to courage.

246
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:35,469
Also, it'll make them aware of the powers who
try to jeopardize Your Majesty's safety.

247
00:25:35,469 --> 00:25:37,304
On the other hand, you can show

248
00:25:37,304 --> 00:25:42,469
how determined the Imperial Court
is in bringing about truth and justice.

249
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:52,595
It's a good idea to let the two Princes know
who are trying to harm Your Majesty.

250
00:25:52,637 --> 00:25:55,221
What do you think?

251
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:58,221
I support his idea.

252
00:25:58,262 --> 00:26:05,137
I think it's a good idea to have them
investigate in a chosen time frame.

253
00:26:06,469 --> 00:26:08,679
Very well.

254
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:10,679
Let us do that then.

255
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:25,217
I'll take that.

256
00:26:32,781 --> 00:26:38,644
This contest on Courage will be to find the
person who stole my personal correspondence.

257
00:26:39,847 --> 00:26:42,850
Through this contest, we will be evaluating

258
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:47,117
your tenaciousness in searching for
the truth, or courage to the end.

259
00:26:51,181 --> 00:26:56,491
Three days will be given
to investigate this matter,

260
00:26:56,491 --> 00:27:00,625
so do your best within this time frame.

261
00:27:05,276 --> 00:27:07,829
I remember the first...

262
00:27:09,384 --> 00:27:11,485
I remember it being inside Tae An Hall...

263
00:27:19,855 --> 00:27:22,139
It doesn't feel right to
interfere in this kind of...

264
00:27:22,139 --> 00:27:28,134
I know. I know this type of request is going
above your duties as my study buddy.

265
00:27:29,787 --> 00:27:36,086
But, you are in a better position to
find out what goes inside the palace.

266
00:27:36,086 --> 00:27:39,548
Also, you can come in and out
of my residence freely.

267
00:27:40,294 --> 00:27:42,071
I request this of you.

268
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,376
I understand, Your Highness.

269
00:27:51,376 --> 00:27:55,032
Thank you.

270
00:27:55,032 --> 00:27:56,980
I have something I wanted
to ask you right away.

271
00:27:58,435 --> 00:28:03,351
What do the court ladies do
when they're not on duty?

272
00:28:04,578 --> 00:28:06,785
Can they move about freely in the palace?

273
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:08,919
It depends on the building.

274
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:14,103
If it's Tae An Hall, they're not allowed
inside unless they are on duty,

275
00:28:15,588 --> 00:28:18,590
It's where Her Majesty resides after all.

276
00:28:24,174 --> 00:28:27,414
I came across something strange
while examining the protocol records.

277
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:36,707
In Tae An Hall, I heard loitering
after work hours is prohibited.

278
00:28:36,707 --> 00:28:40,836
But, why were you still there past
8 p.m. when you were off duty?

279
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,848
Frankly, I wasn't able to get off duty.

280
00:28:46,848 --> 00:28:55,497
I lost my ID card that day, so I
couldn't show that I was off duty.

281
00:28:55,497 --> 00:29:00,398
I still don't understand why
you couldn't leave work...

282
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:06,825
If you lose the ID card, your
evaluation points are taken away.

283
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:09,680
So, what did you do in Tae An Hall?

284
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:14,999
I went around looking for my ID card.

285
00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:26,543
Really? There's no record
of your going off duty.

286
00:29:30,463 --> 00:29:33,573
Well... Your Highness.

287
00:29:35,918 --> 00:29:39,333
While at Tae An Hall looking for my ID card,

288
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:44,359
I saw someone coming out
of Her Majesty's chambers.

289
00:29:46,323 --> 00:29:47,835
Who was that?

290
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:51,828
It was Madam Chamberlain, Your Highness.

291
00:29:51,828 --> 00:29:53,222
Madam Chamberlain?

292
00:29:56,858 --> 00:30:00,018
Right now, Madam Chamberlain
is the only prime suspect.

293
00:30:00,018 --> 00:30:04,086
That's why I'd like to ask a few questions.

294
00:30:04,086 --> 00:30:07,128
When Her Majesty's personal
correspondence disappeared,

295
00:30:07,128 --> 00:30:10,867
is it true you went into the
Tae An Hall chambers?

296
00:30:13,088 --> 00:30:15,155
Yes, Your Highness.

297
00:30:15,952 --> 00:30:20,570
From looking at the entry records that day,

298
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:26,629
you left the palace at around 8 p.m.
and came back late that night.

299
00:30:28,571 --> 00:30:34,216
Just from looking at this, I can only
conclude that you took the correspondence.

300
00:30:34,709 --> 00:30:40,088
It's true that I did leave the
palace and come back at that time,

301
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:43,254
but I did not steal the correspondence.

302
00:30:43,254 --> 00:30:50,100
Then, knowing full well that
Her Majesty was at an event,

303
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:56,673
why did you enter her chambers,
and whom did you meet outside the palace?

304
00:31:02,565 --> 00:31:04,600
Why are you not saying anything?

305
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,025
I cannot... tell you that.

306
00:31:13,563 --> 00:31:19,771
Fine then... The only person to go
inside her chambers that night

307
00:31:19,771 --> 00:31:24,455
after Her Majesty left is you.

308
00:31:26,515 --> 00:31:32,497
Besides, I have a witness to testify
that you took the correspondence.

309
00:31:39,057 --> 00:31:46,050
But, you admit that you went in,
but you didn't take the correspondence?

310
00:31:48,292 --> 00:31:56,047
Why can't you tell me why you went into
Her Majesty's chambers and what you took?

311
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:04,744
Grand Chamberlain.

312
00:32:04,744 --> 00:32:07,111
Yes, Your Highness.

313
00:32:07,111 --> 00:32:12,079
Please escort Madam Chamberlain out
and until this investigation is over,

314
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:14,606
she should be watched by the guards.

315
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,938
As you command.

316
00:32:19,358 --> 00:32:27,931
Wait! Isn't it going overboard to
have the guards watch her?

317
00:32:28,837 --> 00:32:32,451
Right now, Madam Chamberlain
is the prime suspect.

318
00:32:34,007 --> 00:32:40,711
I personally don't like this, but I
must follow the rules of investigation.

319
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:46,311
Prince Moonsung is right, Your Highness.

320
00:32:52,382 --> 00:32:54,160
Please stand up.

321
00:33:26,791 --> 00:33:28,881
You have to help Prince Moonsung?

322
00:33:29,436 --> 00:33:32,218
Then, whose side are you taking this time?

323
00:33:33,752 --> 00:33:38,928
I honestly don't know...
But, do you have money?

324
00:33:39,456 --> 00:33:44,735
This one is the best for my skin tone.
Stop worrying!

325
00:33:44,735 --> 00:33:48,695
I got back all the money I had lent to
Attendant Kim from Tae An Hall with interest!

326
00:33:50,623 --> 00:33:52,217
The attendant who was in
debt that you told me about?

327
00:33:52,217 --> 00:33:53,962
Don't speak of it.

328
00:33:53,962 --> 00:33:58,202
There's not one attendant
who didn't lend her money.

329
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:02,757
Everyone's talking about it. She's
really into expensive luxury brands,

330
00:34:02,757 --> 00:34:07,912
and ran up her credit card, so she was
trying to borrow money from everyone.

331
00:34:09,944 --> 00:34:12,283
So, how did you get the money to pay back?

332
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:16,739
I have no idea! But, she
almost ran off with my money.

333
00:34:18,613 --> 00:34:21,240
Oh my! Isn't that Attendant Kim?

334
00:34:25,641 --> 00:34:28,342
She does know the best things…

335
00:34:29,361 --> 00:34:35,634
But... for someone who just paid off her
debts, how can she buy all that makeup?

336
00:34:36,048 --> 00:34:38,321
Where could she have gotten so much money?

337
00:34:55,212 --> 00:34:57,253
I was on my way to pay my respects,

338
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:59,796
But, you must be going
somewhere, Your Highness.

339
00:34:59,837 --> 00:35:03,879
I was on my way to the Jipyoung Tower.

340
00:35:03,921 --> 00:35:06,046
Congratulations, Your Highness.

341
00:35:06,088 --> 00:35:09,004
Congratulations?

342
00:35:09,004 --> 00:35:11,169
For what?

343
00:35:11,169 --> 00:35:19,169
Now that the competition is practically
over, you'll feel much more at ease.

344
00:35:19,504 --> 00:35:21,921
The competition isn't over yet.

345
00:35:21,962 --> 00:35:29,671
It's over, now that Prince
Moonsung found the culprit.

346
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:35,504
Is there any need to continue
with the competition?

347
00:35:35,545 --> 00:35:42,212
Grand Duchess, the
investigation isn't over yet.

348
00:35:42,212 --> 00:35:50,212
I'm more worried a woman's rash
judgment will cause misfortune.

349
00:35:50,671 --> 00:35:53,754
We'll get the results soon.

350
00:36:07,253 --> 00:36:11,379
What brings you to the Jipyoung Tower?

351
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,504
I came here to see you because I heard

352
00:36:15,504 --> 00:36:21,587
that you always visit
Prince Youngsung at this hour.

353
00:36:21,587 --> 00:36:25,504
I'm honored, Your Highness.

354
00:36:28,837 --> 00:36:32,129
Shall we sit down?

355
00:36:43,253 --> 00:36:51,253
I was your age when I first
came to live in the palace.

356
00:36:51,504 --> 00:36:57,462
I've been through a lot after coming
to this place at a young age.

357
00:36:57,504 --> 00:37:01,796
Many women have lived in the palace,

358
00:37:01,837 --> 00:37:05,879
but do you know that the Empress is the
only woman who can live in the palace

359
00:37:05,921 --> 00:37:07,712
for the rest of her life?

360
00:37:09,671 --> 00:37:12,545
Yes.

361
00:37:12,587 --> 00:37:18,796
Your thoughts will lead to determination,
and eventually become reality.

362
00:37:18,796 --> 00:37:23,504
So, did you hear from your father?

363
00:37:23,504 --> 00:37:25,754
Yes, Your Highness.

364
00:37:25,754 --> 00:37:28,462
What do you think?

365
00:37:28,504 --> 00:37:31,712
Is it okay for me to have my expectations?

366
00:37:31,754 --> 00:37:39,088
If I can, I want to help Prince
Youngsung with my life.

367
00:37:39,129 --> 00:37:45,212
But, I hope Prince Youngsung doesn't
feel uncomfortable with how I feel.

368
00:37:45,253 --> 00:37:47,420
Uncomfortable?

369
00:37:47,462 --> 00:37:51,169
You two are already good friends.

370
00:37:59,088 --> 00:38:00,712
No way.

371
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:05,337
All the palace attendants here
look up to Madam Chamberlain.

372
00:38:05,379 --> 00:38:09,295
We can't make an investigation
based on personal feelings.

373
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:40,169
Not many palace attendants
like Attendant Kim.

374
00:38:40,169 --> 00:38:43,587
Do you trust her testimony?

375
00:38:43,629 --> 00:38:49,212
The witness and Madam Chamberlain's
testimonies matched.

376
00:38:49,253 --> 00:38:51,088
I don't have a reason to doubt her.

377
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:55,046
I heard from the Inspector Court Lady

378
00:38:55,088 --> 00:39:01,712
that Attendant Kim told Prince Youngsung
she doesn't know anything.

379
00:39:01,712 --> 00:39:07,379
Don't you think it's strange how she gave
different answers to different people?

380
00:39:25,169 --> 00:39:27,169
I'm full of jealousy.

381
00:39:27,169 --> 00:39:29,088
Take it easy.

382
00:39:29,129 --> 00:39:32,169
You should ditch once in a while.

383
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:42,545
I heard about Madam Chamberlain.

384
00:39:42,587 --> 00:39:44,253
What should we do?

385
00:39:44,295 --> 00:39:50,837
What can we do? We have
to bring out the truth.

386
00:39:50,879 --> 00:39:57,088
You know... I don't trust Attendant Kim.

387
00:40:09,545 --> 00:40:13,337
Yongnam told me Attendant Kim
had a lot of credit card debt,

388
00:40:13,337 --> 00:40:19,129
but she somehow found the money
to pay it all off and splurge.

389
00:40:19,169 --> 00:40:22,169
Really?

390
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:27,169
Is that the only reason why
you didn't tell him anything?

391
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,504
Yes, Your Highness.

392
00:40:28,545 --> 00:40:36,046
Many attendants including myself
want you to become Crown Prince.

393
00:40:36,088 --> 00:40:40,212
That's why I told you what happened.

394
00:40:46,169 --> 00:40:47,212
Joon!

395
00:40:54,337 --> 00:40:58,212
Good afternoon, Grand Duchess.

396
00:40:58,253 --> 00:41:01,921
- You may go outside now.
- Okay.

397
00:41:13,169 --> 00:41:18,295
I heard the case is practically over.

398
00:41:18,295 --> 00:41:21,545
I knew my son would do it.

399
00:41:21,587 --> 00:41:30,253
Even the Imperial Court can't do anything
about who becomes Crown Prince now.

400
00:41:30,295 --> 00:41:33,504
You don't seem to mind today.

401
00:41:33,545 --> 00:41:39,004
You didn't ask me why I was having tea
with an attendant or who she is.

402
00:41:39,046 --> 00:41:46,169
Why? Do I need to pay
attention to this attendant?

403
00:41:52,253 --> 00:41:54,545
Lady Yoo?

404
00:41:56,962 --> 00:42:02,129
Make sure Joon doesn't find out.

405
00:42:17,796 --> 00:42:22,169
[Grand Duchess Hyojang]

406
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:31,169
If Madam Chamberlain didn't do it,

407
00:42:31,169 --> 00:42:34,379
then that means the witness
gave a false testimony.

408
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,169
False testimony?

409
00:42:35,169 --> 00:42:36,169
Yes.

410
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:39,240
When there isn't any evidence,
a witness can give false testimony,

411
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,000
and the truth gets covered up.

412
00:42:42,276 --> 00:42:44,623
Did you get a background
check done on that witness?

413
00:42:45,921 --> 00:42:47,169
Background check?

414
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:49,169
She should have something on file.

415
00:42:49,169 --> 00:42:54,587
What an interesting case.

416
00:42:54,587 --> 00:42:57,796
Until darkness falls...

417
00:42:57,796 --> 00:42:59,867
Dark mysteries...

418
00:42:59,867 --> 00:43:02,929
- Coming soon!
- Coming soon...

419
00:43:04,129 --> 00:43:06,088
You guys are so cute!

420
00:43:06,837 --> 00:43:09,169
Hey! Where are you going?

421
00:43:15,712 --> 00:43:20,796
What you asked me to find out requires
the financial supervisor's permission.

422
00:43:20,837 --> 00:43:23,170
So, it'll be ready by the morning
after tomorrow because it takes time.

423
00:43:23,212 --> 00:43:25,170
Really?

424
00:43:26,754 --> 00:43:27,671
Oh, no.

425
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:29,337
[Witness Statement]

426
00:43:29,337 --> 00:43:33,169
[Attendant Kim Minah /
Background Check Information]

427
00:43:42,379 --> 00:43:45,169
I know everything.

428
00:43:45,169 --> 00:43:51,170
You framed Madam Chamberlain, right?

429
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:53,504
I'm impressed... that you found out so soon.

430
00:43:53,545 --> 00:43:58,818
So, what are you going to do about it?

431
00:43:58,818 --> 00:44:07,447
Does this mean you planned
this competition out as well?

432
00:44:08,776 --> 00:44:12,472
And, I became your puppet again!

433
00:44:15,712 --> 00:44:20,169
I will go back and tell everyone the truth.

434
00:44:20,169 --> 00:44:23,796
Her name is Yang Sooneui, right?

435
00:44:23,837 --> 00:44:31,837
I won't have a problem with her
if you become Crown Prince.

436
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:40,962
Do you know what it means to have power?

437
00:44:40,962 --> 00:44:48,587
Having power means... I
can do whatever I want.

438
00:44:48,629 --> 00:44:51,462
I can do whatever I want.

439
00:44:51,504 --> 00:44:56,337
That's why people strive for power.

440
00:44:56,379 --> 00:44:58,587
Women aren't any different.

441
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:02,462
Women want men who have power.

442
00:45:02,504 --> 00:45:05,462
Are you telling me to turn a blind eye to

443
00:45:05,504 --> 00:45:07,921
Madam's Chamberlain's
false charge to get what I want?

444
00:45:07,921 --> 00:45:19,295
You've already experienced how much benefit
you can reap by keeping your mouth closed.

445
00:45:20,462 --> 00:45:27,587
One wrong move, and your mother
and I will suffer the consequences.

446
00:45:27,629 --> 00:45:31,921
Think carefully before you act.

447
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:08,796
I can't believe I'm making
you suffer like this.

448
00:46:08,837 --> 00:46:14,462
Suffer? Not at all.

449
00:46:14,462 --> 00:46:18,046
Please be strong.

450
00:46:18,046 --> 00:46:22,337
Your Majesty is the parent of this country.

451
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:23,671
Madam Chamberlain.

452
00:46:23,712 --> 00:46:31,671
I am willing to do this
and more for Your Majesty.

453
00:46:31,712 --> 00:46:34,379
If it wasn't for you,

454
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:42,420
an orphan like me couldn't have worked
in the palace or gone to school.

455
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:51,921
Your Majesty has already done enough for me.

456
00:46:51,921 --> 00:46:56,462
Don't worry about what's
going to happen to me.

457
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:26,169
Your Majesty, the two Princes'
investigation term is up.

458
00:47:26,295 --> 00:47:32,212
We need to pass this case onto
the Royal Investigative Commission.

459
00:47:35,962 --> 00:47:40,504
I have no choice, since that's
how it's supposed to be done.

460
00:47:40,545 --> 00:47:46,462
Your Majesty, I have a favor to ask.

461
00:47:46,504 --> 00:47:52,837
Please give me an extra
day to investigate this case.

462
00:47:52,837 --> 00:47:59,253
Prince Youngsung, we've never had the
Princes investigate a case like this before.

463
00:47:59,253 --> 00:48:03,379
We can't stop the Investigative
Commission from intervening anymore.

464
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:06,462
We only have one palace
attendant's testimony.

465
00:48:06,504 --> 00:48:09,962
And the suspect refuses
to tell us what happened.

466
00:48:10,004 --> 00:48:12,796
We don't even have conclusive evidence.

467
00:48:12,837 --> 00:48:20,837
I think a person's reputation says
a lot about who that person is.

468
00:48:21,169 --> 00:48:27,169
Accordingly, I strongly believe
Madam Chamberlain didn't do it.

469
00:48:27,169 --> 00:48:31,671
Can you prove her innocence in a day?

470
00:48:31,671 --> 00:48:33,337
Yes.

471
00:48:33,337 --> 00:48:39,169
Please give me one
more day to investigate.

472
00:48:39,169 --> 00:48:46,754
I think we need Prince Moonsung's
consent to be fair.

473
00:48:48,046 --> 00:48:50,253
What do you think, Prince Moonsung?

474
00:48:50,295 --> 00:48:55,295
A fair competition can only be
attained by following the rules.

475
00:48:55,337 --> 00:49:01,879
I can't accept Prince Youngsung's proposal.

476
00:49:01,879 --> 00:49:04,337
This isn't about our competition.

477
00:49:04,337 --> 00:49:07,462
This is about a person's life.

478
00:49:07,462 --> 00:49:15,462
If I can't prove her innocence in a day,
I'll forfeit the remaining competition.

479
00:49:27,379 --> 00:49:32,504
Why did you do this for me?

480
00:49:34,088 --> 00:49:39,295
Because I know that you didn't do it.

481
00:49:41,295 --> 00:49:48,169
To be honest, you can say
that I'm doing this for myself.

482
00:49:48,169 --> 00:49:53,754
I think l now understand why my
mother acknowledged the crime.

483
00:49:53,796 --> 00:50:01,796
Maybe she took the blame to protect
someone else like you're doing right now.

484
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:14,545
Maybe my mother was in the
same situation you're in.

485
00:50:14,587 --> 00:50:19,004
Of course, I don't think
that's the right thing to do.

486
00:50:19,046 --> 00:50:27,046
Regardless of what your reasons are,
you shouldn't distort the truth.

487
00:50:29,046 --> 00:50:37,046
I'm going to bring out the truth
about you and my mother.

488
00:50:51,169 --> 00:50:53,796
These are the files you mentioned.

489
00:50:57,169 --> 00:50:58,796
Thanks.

490
00:50:58,837 --> 00:51:04,962
I've brought them like you said,
but you can't read them all in one day.

491
00:51:05,004 --> 00:51:08,170
I have to do whatever it takes.

492
00:51:08,212 --> 00:51:12,088
Your school friends are outside right now.

493
00:51:16,295 --> 00:51:18,671
Right this way.

494
00:51:21,921 --> 00:51:23,295
What are you guys doing here?

495
00:51:23,337 --> 00:51:26,169
What are friends for?

496
00:51:26,169 --> 00:51:29,169
This is when you use your friends.

497
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:32,587
File after file to read.

498
00:51:32,629 --> 00:51:36,253
Sure, let's do it.

499
00:51:36,295 --> 00:51:37,545
Thanks.

500
00:51:37,587 --> 00:51:39,337
- Let's do this.
- Let do it.

[Prince Hours]

502
00:51:46,504 --> 00:51:52,046
One day won't change anything.

503
00:51:52,046 --> 00:51:59,671
I can understand why he doesn't want
to lose, but he's wasting his time.

504
00:51:59,712 --> 00:52:03,879
He's not doing it because
he doesn't want to lose.

505
00:52:03,921 --> 00:52:06,754
He wants to do everything he can
to save Madam Chamberlain

506
00:52:06,796 --> 00:52:09,796
because he believes that she's innocent.

507
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:16,088
That's just who he is.

508
00:52:40,864 --> 00:52:44,852
- Take a look at this?
- What is it?

509
00:52:44,852 --> 00:52:48,987
I think it's...

510
00:52:58,992 --> 00:53:04,402
Hey! Hey! Attendant Kim's clock-out time!

511
00:53:04,402 --> 00:53:05,125
- Clock-out time?
- Where did I just see that?

512
00:53:59,471 --> 00:54:02,846
You had your extra day.

513
00:54:02,888 --> 00:54:06,053
Did you find anything?

514
00:54:09,929 --> 00:54:14,554
Captain, please bring Attendant Kim,
the witness to this case.

515
00:54:14,596 --> 00:54:18,970
And, I'd like Lady Yoo of Empress Dowager's
Court to come and sit in with her.

516
00:54:24,721 --> 00:54:27,137
Sit in the inside chair.

517
00:54:42,053 --> 00:54:45,471
Have a seat.

518
00:54:52,804 --> 00:54:54,095
Attendant Kim, you said that you saw

519
00:54:54,137 --> 00:54:59,762
Madam Chamberlain walk out of Her
Majesty's chambers on that day.

520
00:54:59,762 --> 00:55:00,888
Correct?

521
00:55:02,304 --> 00:55:04,137
Yes.

522
00:55:04,137 --> 00:55:08,596
But, Madam Chamberlain
said she didn't see you.

523
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:13,762
Attendant Kim, how far away were
you from Madam Chamberlain?

524
00:55:20,969 --> 00:55:23,345
About this much?

525
00:55:23,387 --> 00:55:25,262
Yes.

526
00:55:25,304 --> 00:55:26,969
According to the records, you saw

527
00:55:26,969 --> 00:55:32,721
Madam Chamberlain walking out with
a folder with the Imperial Seal on it.

528
00:55:32,721 --> 00:55:38,929
Can you see the Imperial Seal?

529
00:55:38,929 --> 00:55:42,637
Yes, I can see it.

530
00:55:42,679 --> 00:55:44,969
You can?

531
00:55:46,762 --> 00:55:52,262
You really do have poor vision.

532
00:55:52,304 --> 00:55:59,554
This folder doesn't have any seal on it.

533
00:55:59,596 --> 00:56:04,969
This is Attendant Kim's personal information.

534
00:56:04,969 --> 00:56:11,387
It says here that here that
your vision is 0.4 and 0.3.

535
00:56:11,387 --> 00:56:14,929
But, it seems as though it's gotten worse.

536
00:56:14,929 --> 00:56:16,969
Besides, it was night time.

537
00:56:16,969 --> 00:56:20,095
Only a small light was on
after Her Majesty had left.

538
00:56:20,137 --> 00:56:22,969
The room was much darker than it is now.

539
00:56:22,969 --> 00:56:30,345
Attendant Kim couldn't have seen
a small seal from this distance.

540
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:36,179
I have another piece of evidence
that she gave false testimony.

541
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:41,554
You stated you didn't go home that night

542
00:56:41,554 --> 00:56:45,969
after your shift ended because
you had lost your badge?

543
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:46,969
Yes.

544
00:56:46,969 --> 00:56:49,137
So, did you find it?

545
00:56:49,179 --> 00:56:52,304
Pardon?

546
00:56:52,345 --> 00:56:54,679
Y-yes.

547
00:56:54,721 --> 00:56:55,969
That's a relief.

548
00:56:55,969 --> 00:57:01,304
Did you find it in the reception hall?

549
00:57:01,345 --> 00:57:04,220
Yes.

550
00:57:04,262 --> 00:57:09,137
When did you lose your badge?

551
00:57:09,179 --> 00:57:13,345
I don't remember...

552
00:57:15,888 --> 00:57:23,429
The Court Lady who was at the station said
she didn't see you from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.

553
00:57:23,471 --> 00:57:28,095
That means you must've lost your
badge before 6 p.m. at least.

554
00:57:28,137 --> 00:57:30,969
Correct?

555
00:57:30,969 --> 00:57:37,137
Yes, probably...

556
00:57:37,179 --> 00:57:45,179
But, there's a record of your entry at
7:20 p.m. at the Empress Dowager's Court.

557
00:57:49,804 --> 00:57:52,512
How do you explain this?

558
00:57:52,512 --> 00:57:56,387
Did you lie about the badge as well?

559
00:58:02,554 --> 00:58:08,762
You recently paid off all the money
you owe the other attendants.

560
00:58:08,804 --> 00:58:11,053
That totaled to more than $10,000.

561
00:58:11,095 --> 00:58:14,179
Where did you get the money?

562
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:19,345
The Investigative Commission will
find out where it came from.

563
00:58:19,345 --> 00:58:22,596
Thus, all evidence leads to the fact

564
00:58:22,596 --> 00:58:28,179
that Attendant Kim committed perjury
against Madam Chamberlain

565
00:58:28,179 --> 00:58:33,969
who stayed true to her conviction and honor.

566
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:36,888
Now tell me the truth!

567
00:58:36,929 --> 00:58:44,137
You stole Her Majesty's
letter that night, right?

568
00:58:44,179 --> 00:58:47,179
Answer!

569
00:58:49,596 --> 00:58:51,596
I'm sorry...

570
00:59:01,053 --> 00:59:02,846
Forgive me.

571
00:59:02,888 --> 00:59:07,179
I only did what I was told to do.

572
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:12,804
Lady Yoo, help me!

573
00:59:28,762 --> 00:59:30,888
Hello?

574
00:59:30,888 --> 00:59:34,637
Uh-huh.

575
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:38,304
Really?

576
00:59:38,345 --> 00:59:41,262
Okay.

577
00:59:41,304 --> 00:59:42,512
He did it!

578
00:59:42,554 --> 00:59:45,387
Prince Youngsung found the real culprit!

579
00:59:45,429 --> 00:59:46,262
Really?

580
00:59:46,304 --> 00:59:48,471
Thank God!

581
00:59:48,909 --> 00:59:52,794
- Whoa! That's right!
- Yeah!

582
00:59:54,218 --> 00:59:57,111
My goodness!

583
01:00:09,969 --> 01:00:12,721
Madam Chamberlain!

584
01:00:12,762 --> 01:00:16,012
Were you waiting for me?

585
01:00:16,053 --> 01:00:18,969
Thank you, Your Highness.

586
01:00:18,969 --> 01:00:22,053
I've troubled you in many ways.

587
01:00:23,721 --> 01:00:25,970
I only did what I was supposed to do.

588
01:00:26,012 --> 01:00:27,969
You saved me last time.

589
01:00:27,969 --> 01:00:30,095
We're even now.

590
01:00:34,471 --> 01:00:41,095
It seems like only yesterday
you came into this palace.

591
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:44,762
You've changed a lot.

592
01:01:04,095 --> 01:01:06,012
Are you looking for someone?

593
01:01:14,512 --> 01:01:17,220
Congratulations.

594
01:01:17,262 --> 01:01:19,095
Thanks.

595
01:01:19,137 --> 01:01:21,969
Were you looking for me?

596
01:01:25,429 --> 01:01:29,137
No, my study buddy.

597
01:01:29,179 --> 01:01:31,012
Yeah, right.

598
01:01:32,387 --> 01:01:36,345
You can't even live a day without me, right?

599
01:01:38,345 --> 01:01:40,262
Says who?

600
01:01:42,929 --> 01:01:44,969
Attendant Yang.

601
01:01:44,969 --> 01:01:46,762
Come in.

602
01:01:48,471 --> 01:01:51,929
Come on! Come in, I said.

603
01:01:51,969 --> 01:01:54,095
Didn't you hear the Prince?

604
01:01:58,095 --> 01:02:00,345
Come on.

605
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:17,554
If you're inside, why are you looking around?

606
01:02:23,969 --> 01:02:27,969
Were you going to go
home if I hadn't seen you?

607
01:02:29,095 --> 01:02:32,053
Easier said than done.

608
01:02:32,095 --> 01:02:33,804
Why not?

609
01:02:33,846 --> 01:02:37,179
Saeryung visits Prince Moonsung
whenever she wants.

610
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:39,969
Is it the same?

611
01:02:39,969 --> 01:02:41,596
What's so different?

612
01:02:43,053 --> 01:02:44,969
Maybe it is.

613
01:02:47,012 --> 01:02:53,846
Anyway, I want to be simple-minded
and brave whenever I see you.

614
01:02:53,846 --> 01:02:55,804
You already are.

615
01:02:55,804 --> 01:02:58,637
Look what you did for Madam Chamberlain.

616
01:02:58,679 --> 01:03:02,304
You're becoming more and more like a royal.

617
01:03:02,345 --> 01:03:07,512
Well, I fell down and got back
on my feet several times.

618
01:03:09,179 --> 01:03:11,929
Like how we met again.

619
01:03:11,969 --> 01:03:13,471
Remember?

620
01:03:15,012 --> 01:03:18,345
You were holding some sort of tray.

621
01:03:22,095 --> 01:03:22,970
"Are you..."

622
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:28,804
"Are you..."

623
01:03:43,637 --> 01:03:45,012
Hello!

624
01:03:48,137 --> 01:03:49,969
Is His Highness in?

625
01:03:49,970 --> 01:03:50,970
Yes, he is.

626
01:03:51,012 --> 01:03:53,471
Please go in.

627
01:05:08,262 --> 01:05:10,179
Saeryung!

628
01:05:14,012 --> 01:05:16,970
Forgive me, Your Highness.

629
01:05:17,012 --> 01:05:18,969
I have to go.

630
01:05:32,969 --> 01:05:38,012
I wonder how I fell for you.

631
01:05:40,596 --> 01:05:45,012
We fought whenever we saw each other.

632
01:05:48,429 --> 01:05:53,888
I can't believe we're doing this right now.

633
01:05:57,429 --> 01:05:59,179
Yang Sooneui.

634
01:06:01,888 --> 01:06:05,220
Let's not hide our feelings.

635
01:06:05,262 --> 01:06:07,846
Let's follow our hearts.

636
01:06:10,137 --> 01:06:12,345
Follow our hearts?

637
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:17,721
Will that be okay?

638
01:06:55,013 --> 01:06:56,424
[Prince Hours]

639
01:06:58,219 --> 01:07:01,400
Why don't we settle the marriage proposal

640
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,879
between Prince Youngsung and Miss Saeryung?

641
01:07:05,978 --> 01:07:09,396
Prince Youngsung and I
started seeing each other

642
01:07:09,396 --> 01:07:12,531
after we found out how we
felt toward each other.

643
01:07:14,744 --> 01:07:20,611
For ruining the lives of those two, no,
all those involved... you'll pay the price.

644
01:07:20,611 --> 01:07:22,148
Must you follow your
petty sense of justice

645
01:07:22,148 --> 01:07:24,472
at the expense of ruining a person
with whom you have a familial bond?

646
01:07:26,006 --> 01:07:30,857
Just what is wrong with you two?
Two princes fighting over a court lady?

647
01:07:32,169 --> 01:07:37,284
You have to be my son
until the day you die!

648
01:07:38,837 --> 01:07:40,418
Let's just stay friends.

649
01:07:40,418 --> 01:07:42,676
This is the first time I've opened
my heart and liked someone.

650
01:07:42,676 --> 01:07:45,193
How can I stop now?
