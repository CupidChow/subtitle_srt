1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:04,246
They're coming!

2
00:00:05,523 --> 00:00:06,309
Wait! Wait!

3
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:07,777
Please say something!

4
00:00:07,777 --> 00:00:09,867
Wait! Wait!

5
00:00:13,442 --> 00:00:15,983
How can you be so thoughtless?

6
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:22,815
The Empress is having
enough trouble as it is!

7
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:27,275
What are we going to do about this?

8
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:28,815
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:28,815 --> 00:00:30,815
It's not his fault, Mother.

10
00:00:30,815 --> 00:00:34,815
Don't defend him.

11
00:00:34,815 --> 00:00:39,317
You should be concerned about
the safety of the Imperial Court.

12
00:00:39,317 --> 00:00:42,650
I can't believe you did this.

13
00:00:45,815 --> 00:00:51,815
What will happen to the Imperial Court if
the people turn their backs on you?

14
00:00:51,815 --> 00:00:57,815
I should ask the Prime Minister for his help.

15
00:01:13,815 --> 00:01:16,815
Your Highness Prince Moonsung!

16
00:01:20,358 --> 00:01:23,066
What are you doing here?

17
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:36,815
I couldn't think of anywhere else to go.

18
00:01:36,815 --> 00:01:45,815
Everything has fallen apart.

19
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:53,815
Attendant Yang.

20
00:01:53,815 --> 00:01:57,815
I need you to hold me.

21
00:02:07,815 --> 00:02:09,442
Your Highness!

22
00:02:09,442 --> 00:02:10,815
Your Highness!

23
00:02:10,815 --> 00:02:12,815
Your Highness!

24
00:03:38,941 --> 00:03:41,815
Your Highness!

25
00:03:47,815 --> 00:03:50,815
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:53,442
I really put you through a lot of trouble.

27
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:57,815
Forget about that... are you alright?

28
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:21,871
Geez! A grown woman like you should
cover your mouth when you yawn!

29
00:04:21,871 --> 00:04:26,638
What do you expect? I stayed up all night
because of the emergency situation.

30
00:04:26,638 --> 00:04:29,563
But, he's giving us a ride though.

31
00:04:29,911 --> 00:04:34,146
Of course! I'm a very
generous person, you know.

32
00:04:34,146 --> 00:04:39,247
Attendant Ma, how about a cup of hot
coffee when we get to your place?

33
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:43,295
I'm so sleepy I'm about to pass
out and you want coffee?

34
00:04:50,127 --> 00:04:52,014
Your Highness!

35
00:05:07,989 --> 00:05:09,353
Thank you.

36
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:29,666
What's going on? I didn't know
they had that kind of relationship.

37
00:05:30,475 --> 00:05:36,558
Oh, my! This is shocking! This is hot news!

38
00:05:36,558 --> 00:05:38,142
There's no way!

39
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:42,255
[Her Majesty's Scandal]

40
00:05:42,255 --> 00:05:50,749
You pulled it off, Grand Prince. The mighty
Empress walked right into your trap.

41
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:55,530
Now all that's left is the last competition.

42
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:59,279
We must get rid of the Empress
while she's in a weak position.

43
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,938
Did you try calling Joon?

44
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:17,831
I couldn't get a hold of
him all night. I'm worried.

45
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,737
Father...

46
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:23,912
This is worse than we expected.

47
00:07:23,912 --> 00:07:28,703
Those who instigate the
public are a real problem.

48
00:07:28,703 --> 00:07:31,532
But, some citizens are even
asking you to step down.

49
00:07:31,532 --> 00:07:34,283
Oh, my head... Ow...

50
00:07:34,494 --> 00:07:36,870
Mother...

51
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:41,996
It's okay. I'm okay.

52
00:07:41,996 --> 00:07:46,494
Now that we're all here,
let's think of a plan.

53
00:07:46,494 --> 00:07:52,494
We should do something
before public opinion gets worse.

54
00:07:52,494 --> 00:07:58,494
For instance, you can make
a formal announcement.

55
00:07:58,494 --> 00:08:02,585
Your Majesty should just tell
everyone that you're not in

56
00:08:02,585 --> 00:08:09,943
a relationship with Professor Alexander,
but just friends from school.

57
00:08:09,943 --> 00:08:13,704
How does that sound?

58
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:22,494
I think that's enough to pacify the public.

59
00:08:22,494 --> 00:08:29,371
I don't think that's right.
I can't lie to the people.

60
00:08:29,371 --> 00:08:32,494
I agree.

61
00:08:32,494 --> 00:08:35,704
Thing might get worse.

62
00:08:35,704 --> 00:08:41,494
Why don't we make them pay
attention to something else?

63
00:08:41,494 --> 00:08:50,870
We can speed up the Crown Prince
installment, or announce a royal wedding.

64
00:09:00,494 --> 00:09:06,494
If Prince Moonsung becomes the Crown Prince,

65
00:09:06,494 --> 00:09:15,745
Grand Prince Hyojang will try to dethrone the
Empress and make Prince Moonsung the Emperor.

66
00:09:15,745 --> 00:09:24,494
That's the worst-case scenario, but that'll
come true if we don't do anything.

67
00:09:24,494 --> 00:09:30,329
That's why we decided to go through
with your wedding with Miss Saeryung.

68
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:35,494
That's our only resort.

69
00:09:35,494 --> 00:09:43,704
I will do my best for the remainder of
the competition, but I won't marry her.

70
00:09:43,704 --> 00:09:47,870
I won't let you marry Attendant Yang!

71
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:53,329
Think of what happened to your mother.

72
00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:59,494
A royal can't choose to
marry whomever he wishes.

73
00:09:59,494 --> 00:10:01,620
Even if I give you my approval,

74
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,037
you need the Royal Kin
and Royal Council's consent.

75
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:13,371
There's even a lengthy process of seeing
how the public will feel about the wedding!

76
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:25,578
A royal cannot live by emotions alone.

77
00:10:25,578 --> 00:10:32,287
With our privileges come
duties and responsibilities.

78
00:10:38,494 --> 00:10:40,494
What did you just say?

79
00:10:40,494 --> 00:10:45,494
I will forfeit the last competition.

80
00:10:50,494 --> 00:10:53,246
I'm sorry.

81
00:10:56,494 --> 00:11:04,494
I thought you wanted to make a deal with me.

82
00:11:04,494 --> 00:11:07,494
Listen.

83
00:11:07,494 --> 00:11:11,037
The Empress will soon be dethroned.

84
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:17,494
What's left for you is not the seat
of Crown Prince, but of Emperor.

85
00:11:17,494 --> 00:11:23,787
You don't have to do anything.
Just sit back and watch.

86
00:11:23,787 --> 00:11:31,494
All you need to do is keep
your place in this competition.

87
00:12:54,494 --> 00:12:57,494
Your Highness.

88
00:13:00,578 --> 00:13:10,537
Her Majesty has ordered you to write the
character on the scroll by this evening.

89
00:16:15,494 --> 00:16:22,704
I'd like to commend both
of you for a job well done.

90
00:16:22,704 --> 00:16:26,494
Store these in the Imperial Safe
and guard them closely

91
00:16:26,494 --> 00:16:30,329
until you are given further instructions.

92
00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:33,745
Yes, Grand Chamberlain.

93
00:17:00,246 --> 00:17:06,079
Prince Youngsung can't oppose
this marriage forever.

94
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:13,204
Since the Empress Dowager is
desperate, let's wait for now.

95
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:20,287
All we have left is the last competition.

96
00:17:35,494 --> 00:17:38,037
Good job.

97
00:19:53,454 --> 00:20:00,037
Before we reveal what the two
Princes wrote, we will first reveal

98
00:20:00,037 --> 00:20:07,912
what Her Majesty considers as the
most important virtue of a monarch.

99
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:23,494
Your Majesty! Why did you
turn in a blank scroll?

100
00:20:23,494 --> 00:20:31,494
Her Majesty believes there are many things
a monarch needs in order to have virtue.

101
00:20:31,494 --> 00:20:39,494
A royal calling, insight, sense of balance,
decisiveness, drive, responsibility, faith,

102
00:20:39,494 --> 00:20:46,870
persuasiveness, morality,
along with many others.

103
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:54,494
Being in this position has made me believe
that actions are more important than words.

104
00:20:54,494 --> 00:21:01,494
I need to set my eyes on what
is right and act accordingly.

105
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:13,371
A monarch can make mistakes
if he has selfishness or prejudice.

106
00:21:13,371 --> 00:21:26,494
There are talks about my dethronement
because I've been selfish in my actions.

107
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:36,121
I've concluded that one word cannot
express the virtue of a monarch.

108
00:21:36,121 --> 00:21:39,494
That's why I turned in a blank scroll.

109
00:21:39,494 --> 00:21:45,204
We will now reveal Prince Youngsung's scroll.

110
00:21:58,494 --> 00:22:02,494
You wrote "sacrifice."

111
00:22:02,494 --> 00:22:06,494
Tell us why you wrote "sacrifice."

112
00:22:06,494 --> 00:22:11,494
I still don't know what it
means to be virtuous.

113
00:22:11,494 --> 00:22:16,287
That's why I wrote what I
think it means to be virtuous.

114
00:22:16,287 --> 00:22:22,454
I think a monarch is someone
who makes sacrifices.

115
00:22:22,454 --> 00:22:24,454
Back in my delivery days,

116
00:22:24,454 --> 00:22:27,494
even being a leader among
deliverymen made me selfless.

117
00:22:27,494 --> 00:22:41,494
I had to be considerate of my
friends to be their leader,

118
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:46,121
and be better than other deliverymen.

119
00:22:46,121 --> 00:22:48,494
When I was on the outside looking in,

120
00:22:48,494 --> 00:22:54,494
I thought Your Majesty lived
elegantly in a nice palace.

121
00:22:54,494 --> 00:23:03,494
But, now I know Your Majesty is someone
who gives up more things than enjoys.

122
00:23:03,494 --> 00:23:12,246
That's why I wrote "sacrifice."

123
00:23:18,204 --> 00:23:23,494
We will now reveal Prince Moonsung's scroll.

124
00:24:02,494 --> 00:24:04,494
A blank scroll?

125
00:24:04,494 --> 00:24:07,121
That's absurd!

126
00:24:07,121 --> 00:24:11,287
Defining virtue with just
one word itself is absurd.

127
00:24:11,287 --> 00:24:16,413
Then, she shouldn't have said
it was one word in the first place.

128
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:20,204
We shouldn't have been so hung up
on the fact that it was one word.

129
00:24:20,204 --> 00:24:25,494
There wasn't an answer in the first place.

130
00:24:25,494 --> 00:24:29,204
He turned in a blank scroll, but that
doesn't mean he meant the same thing!

131
00:24:29,204 --> 00:24:31,079
That's not the important thing here.

132
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:36,494
What's important is that Prince Moonsung won.

133
00:24:36,494 --> 00:24:39,996
What's going to happen to Prince Youngsung?

134
00:24:39,996 --> 00:24:45,494
That's it. I'm going to the palace.

135
00:24:45,494 --> 00:24:47,494
Call me, Saeryung!

136
00:26:08,494 --> 00:26:11,371
I heard the news.

137
00:26:11,371 --> 00:26:16,079
Are you okay?

138
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:21,494
I can't believe I lost.

139
00:26:21,494 --> 00:26:24,494
You did your best.

140
00:26:24,494 --> 00:26:26,494
I have to accept my loss.

141
00:26:26,494 --> 00:26:29,494
I found out something about your mother.

142
00:26:29,494 --> 00:26:31,494
You might know this already,
but there was a problem

143
00:26:31,494 --> 00:26:36,954
because the Educational Foundation
gave some funds to a senior citizens group

144
00:26:36,954 --> 00:26:38,494
while she was Chairwoman of the Board.

145
00:26:38,494 --> 00:26:42,494
She wasn't supposed to do that?

146
00:26:42,494 --> 00:26:51,620
It was for a good cause, but it was
against the foundation's bylaws.

147
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:56,494
You can say she misused
her power as the Chairwoman.

148
00:26:56,494 --> 00:26:59,745
She did it for the public good,
but she did break the law.

149
00:26:59,745 --> 00:27:05,494
There were people who took advantage of that.

150
00:27:06,494 --> 00:27:11,494
By the way, what evidence did you get?

151
00:27:11,537 --> 00:27:12,870
Evidence?

152
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,704
Yes.

153
00:27:14,704 --> 00:27:17,829
I called the former director's family.

154
00:27:17,829 --> 00:27:22,745
And, I heard they gave the
embezzlement evidence to you.

155
00:27:22,745 --> 00:27:24,494
Really?

156
00:27:24,494 --> 00:27:28,494
You didn't hear anything about it?

157
00:27:30,494 --> 00:27:31,494
Really?

158
00:27:31,494 --> 00:27:32,494
So they say!

159
00:27:32,494 --> 00:27:33,868
Seeing that he left in the
morning, isn't it obvious?

160
00:27:33,868 --> 00:27:38,246
Oh my goodness! I thought
there was something going on

161
00:27:38,246 --> 00:27:40,494
with Attendant Yang and Prince
Youngsung at the Royal Academy!

162
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:42,037
You mean she's a two-timer?

163
00:27:42,037 --> 00:27:44,494
That's right.

164
00:27:44,494 --> 00:27:46,204
Can't you find a better use of your time?

165
00:27:46,204 --> 00:27:47,494
That's ridiculous!

166
00:27:47,494 --> 00:27:48,912
Says who?

167
00:27:48,912 --> 00:27:51,287
Who told you that rumor?

168
00:27:51,287 --> 00:27:56,494
It doesn't matter. Everyone
already knows about it.

169
00:28:00,704 --> 00:28:02,578
Eunuch Kwak!

170
00:28:02,578 --> 00:28:04,662
It wasn't me!

171
00:28:04,704 --> 00:28:06,246
Then, was it you?

172
00:28:06,246 --> 00:28:10,704
I only told Attendant Cho. I'm serious!

173
00:28:11,578 --> 00:28:13,494
Oh, no!

174
00:28:13,494 --> 00:28:18,494
What's going to happen to
her now? Yang Sooneui...

175
00:28:33,494 --> 00:28:34,494
Mr. Cho!

176
00:28:41,704 --> 00:28:43,494
Mr. Cho!

177
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:07,494
He's not here.

178
00:29:07,494 --> 00:29:08,578
I wonder what happened.

179
00:29:08,578 --> 00:29:16,494
I hope nothing bad happened to him
because of the evidence he received.

180
00:29:18,329 --> 00:29:20,494
I'll ask my friends.

181
00:29:20,494 --> 00:29:23,494
Let's go outside.

182
00:29:37,494 --> 00:29:40,494
I hope nothing happened.

183
00:29:40,494 --> 00:29:44,494
I'll look into it as soon as we get there.

184
00:29:46,704 --> 00:29:49,494
Would you like to have dinner at my house?

185
00:29:49,494 --> 00:29:55,494
You didn't eat anything the entire day.

186
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:59,494
I'm a little hungry, too.

187
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:07,494
Your Highness.

188
00:30:10,494 --> 00:30:12,494
Huh?

189
00:30:12,494 --> 00:30:15,494
Yes?

190
00:30:15,494 --> 00:30:21,494
You didn't hear anything I said, right?

191
00:30:21,494 --> 00:30:23,787
I'm sorry.

192
00:30:40,745 --> 00:30:44,494
It's from Attendant Yang.

193
00:30:55,662 --> 00:30:57,494
Can you pull over?

194
00:30:57,494 --> 00:31:00,287
I'll get off here.

195
00:31:00,287 --> 00:31:04,494
You can drop me off and speak
comfortably to her on the phone.

196
00:31:04,494 --> 00:31:06,829
We're almost there.

197
00:31:06,829 --> 00:31:11,494
No, it's okay.

198
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:14,494
Please pull over!

199
00:31:34,494 --> 00:31:36,079
Miss Saeryung!

200
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:37,494
Miss Saeryung!

201
00:31:44,494 --> 00:31:46,494
What's wrong with you?

202
00:31:46,494 --> 00:31:49,246
What's wrong with me?

203
00:31:49,246 --> 00:31:53,287
Do you know how I felt in that car?

204
00:31:53,287 --> 00:32:00,246
I felt so useless.

205
00:32:01,704 --> 00:32:05,371
How did this happen to me?

206
00:32:05,371 --> 00:32:08,996
I can't believe I'm....

207
00:32:08,996 --> 00:32:12,494
You're so mean.

208
00:32:12,494 --> 00:32:17,704
Why... why are you making me so miserable?

209
00:32:19,454 --> 00:32:25,578
I don't know... why I can't have you.

210
00:32:25,578 --> 00:32:33,037
I'm trying so much harder than
she is, but I can't have you.

211
00:32:39,494 --> 00:32:41,494
Let's go.

212
00:32:41,494 --> 00:32:43,829
I'll drive you home.

213
00:32:56,494 --> 00:33:03,620
Stand still for a minute.

214
00:33:32,494 --> 00:33:34,494
What are you doing?

215
00:33:44,494 --> 00:33:49,494
What are you doing here at this hour?

216
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:53,494
I was worried about His Highness.

217
00:33:53,494 --> 00:33:58,037
Which one are you talking about?

218
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:04,494
You really are going to
complicate things, aren't you?

219
00:34:04,494 --> 00:34:08,494
Don't you know you're ridiculing
the Empress's favor,

220
00:34:08,494 --> 00:34:10,494
Prince Moonsung's request,

221
00:34:10,494 --> 00:34:19,494
and your relationship with
Prince Youngsung by doing this?

222
00:34:19,494 --> 00:34:24,494
What's wrong with you, Lady Han?

223
00:34:24,494 --> 00:34:28,494
I thought only the brightest women
were allowed to work here!

224
00:34:28,494 --> 00:34:36,870
How can you let a foolish girl
like her roam freely around here?

225
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:45,494
Anyone who doesn't know
her rightful place is a nuisance.

226
00:34:45,494 --> 00:34:51,494
And even more so if we're
talking about the palace.

227
00:34:51,494 --> 00:34:57,494
I better not see you in this palace again!

228
00:35:09,537 --> 00:35:11,494
Prince Youngsung!

229
00:35:11,494 --> 00:35:19,494
Your Highness told me that you
and the Empress need me, right?

230
00:35:19,494 --> 00:35:23,079
I'm sure my father felt the
same way about my mother,

231
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:29,494
and I feel the same way about Yang Sooneui.

232
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:33,745
Now is not the time for you to speak up!

233
00:35:33,745 --> 00:35:39,037
I'm very sorry for losing the competition.

234
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:46,787
But, I was able to get through palace
life because of Yang Sooneui.

235
00:35:46,787 --> 00:35:52,745
If it wasn't for her, I would've
run away a long time ago.

236
00:35:56,494 --> 00:36:03,494
Even in the future, I will always
be where Yang Sooneui is.

237
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:07,494
I don't want to live as my father did.

238
00:36:14,662 --> 00:36:16,829
I'm sorry.

239
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:21,494
I was so worried.

240
00:36:21,494 --> 00:36:24,329
I shouldn't have done that.

241
00:36:28,494 --> 00:36:33,371
What are you thinking about?

242
00:36:33,371 --> 00:36:37,870
I'm not thinking about anything.

243
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:41,494
Are you okay?

244
00:36:41,494 --> 00:36:42,787
Yes.

245
00:36:42,787 --> 00:36:44,954
Don't worry.

246
00:36:44,954 --> 00:36:48,329
I'm okay.

247
00:37:29,787 --> 00:37:34,162
Do you remember the day we first met?

248
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:46,494
How could I forget it?

249
00:37:48,494 --> 00:37:53,620
I came to your house after my parents
passed away when I was seven.

250
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,494
You greeted me with a smile.

251
00:37:56,494 --> 00:38:02,537
I remember the first time you laughed...

252
00:38:02,537 --> 00:38:06,494
You barely spoke for a year.

253
00:38:06,494 --> 00:38:16,662
And, then when we went to the mountain
cottage, you laughed for the first time.

254
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:28,121
Remember how much trouble we got
into because we fell into the river?

255
00:38:28,121 --> 00:38:35,494
I miss those days when we were kids.

256
00:38:35,494 --> 00:38:36,578
Young Master...

257
00:38:36,578 --> 00:38:51,454
I miss those happy days in that cottage
when we didn't know anything.

258
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:15,745
Parliament received a proposal
to dethrone the Empress.

259
00:40:15,745 --> 00:40:17,745
Isn't that going too far?

260
00:40:17,745 --> 00:40:22,537
The Imperial Court should've made
a public announcement sooner.

261
00:40:22,537 --> 00:40:26,371
I have to do whatever it takes to stop it.

262
00:40:26,371 --> 00:40:31,494
First, I have to make sure there's no
more negative press about her.

263
00:40:31,494 --> 00:40:39,494
Since it's the media's nature to chase hot
topics, we need to give them a new one fast.

264
00:40:39,494 --> 00:40:45,870
Both the Empress and the Empress Dowager
have been slow to react... It's frustrating.

265
00:40:53,336 --> 00:40:54,494
[Countdown to Abdication]

266
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:59,204
This matter isn't serious enough
to propose dethronement!

267
00:40:59,204 --> 00:41:01,537
I'm sure Grand Prince Hyojang is behind this!

268
00:41:07,578 --> 00:41:09,912
Your Highness.

269
00:41:09,912 --> 00:41:20,204
Forgive me for saying this, but there
has been a wild rumor in the palace.

270
00:41:24,272 --> 00:41:27,320
[Prince Hours]

271
00:41:28,494 --> 00:41:31,494
We'll be set as soon as the
Lower House passes it.

272
00:41:31,494 --> 00:41:35,454
That means Joon will be the Emperor.

273
00:41:41,787 --> 00:41:43,494
Hello?

274
00:41:43,494 --> 00:41:45,494
Oh, hi.

275
00:41:45,494 --> 00:41:49,494
What's going on?

276
00:41:49,494 --> 00:41:51,704
What?

277
00:41:51,704 --> 00:41:54,494
What did you say?

278
00:42:02,494 --> 00:42:06,371
Grand Prince, what should we do?

279
00:42:06,371 --> 00:42:07,494
The entire palace is gossiping about

280
00:42:07,494 --> 00:42:15,246
the relationship between Joon,
Prince Youngsung, and that girl.

281
00:42:15,246 --> 00:42:22,620
Attendant Yang is out to ruin Joon's future.

282
00:42:31,494 --> 00:42:35,494
Does everyone want to see me collapse?

283
00:42:35,494 --> 00:42:41,454
Mother, calm down.

284
00:42:41,454 --> 00:42:46,494
I'm very disappointed in your
discernment, Empress.

285
00:42:46,494 --> 00:42:55,494
You fostered the seed of trouble.

286
00:42:55,494 --> 00:42:57,829
Kick her out at once!

287
00:42:57,829 --> 00:43:00,494
From both the palace and Royal Academy!

288
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:03,287
No, that can't happen.

289
00:43:03,287 --> 00:43:04,121
What?

290
00:43:04,121 --> 00:43:06,954
Attendant Yang didn't do anything wrong.

291
00:43:06,954 --> 00:43:10,870
She passed the entrance exam and
officially became a palace attendant.

292
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:14,912
You shouldn't kick her out just because
she has something to do with me.

293
00:43:14,912 --> 00:43:18,494
I can't believe you're saying
that after hearing the rumor.

294
00:43:18,494 --> 00:43:21,494
As you said, they're only rumors.

295
00:43:21,494 --> 00:43:27,079
I know who she likes because I like her!

296
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:30,662
Prince Moonsung! Tell them!

297
00:43:30,662 --> 00:43:33,870
Why aren't you saying anything?

298
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:38,494
If you really think about it,
isn't this your fault?

299
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:49,912
I was drunk one night, and went to her house.

300
00:43:49,912 --> 00:43:56,704
I went inside her house because
I was barely able to control my body.

301
00:43:56,704 --> 00:44:02,494
The only thing Attendant Yang did
wrong was providing me with lodging.

302
00:44:02,494 --> 00:44:07,037
You should punish me instead.

303
00:44:07,037 --> 00:44:12,829
I don't want to hear any more of this.

304
00:44:12,829 --> 00:44:21,494
At this point, she should be
held liable for her conduct.

305
00:44:21,494 --> 00:44:25,413
What a disgrace to the Imperial Court!

306
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:29,954
To settle this matter, I'm going to have the
Internal Affairs Division tighten discipline.

307
00:44:29,954 --> 00:44:37,494
If you two object to this, I'll consider
it as a show of contempt to me.

308
00:44:39,745 --> 00:44:45,578
I'd also like the Empress
to stay out of this.

309
00:44:50,787 --> 00:44:54,494
Here's your change.

310
00:44:54,494 --> 00:45:00,494
You can keep the change,
but can you tell me your secret?

311
00:45:00,494 --> 00:45:01,494
What?

312
00:45:01,494 --> 00:45:07,079
How did you seduce both Princes?

313
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:11,454
Like they say, it's always the quiet ones.

314
00:45:11,454 --> 00:45:12,494
Watch your mouth.

315
00:45:12,494 --> 00:45:16,494
Oh my, does that mean
the rumors are true?

316
00:45:16,494 --> 00:45:20,578
Isn't there a huge difference
between a commoner and a royal?

317
00:45:20,578 --> 00:45:26,787
There is... as much as this change.

318
00:45:55,494 --> 00:45:59,494
Are you satisfied now?

319
00:45:59,494 --> 00:46:07,494
The Empress Dowager summoned
and scolded both Princes.

320
00:46:07,494 --> 00:46:10,494
What are you going to do now?

321
00:46:10,494 --> 00:46:14,204
Are you going to hide behind
them this time, too?

322
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:20,413
You asked me to choose one, right?

323
00:46:20,413 --> 00:46:24,494
From the start, all I wanted
was Prince Youngsung.

324
00:46:24,494 --> 00:46:27,494
So, I have nothing to hide.

325
00:46:29,494 --> 00:46:33,037
How can you be so confident?

326
00:46:33,037 --> 00:46:34,494
Do you want to know?

327
00:46:34,494 --> 00:46:37,494
Very much so.

328
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:39,620
Because I believe in Hoo.

329
00:47:00,454 --> 00:47:01,494
Madam Chamberlain!

330
00:47:01,494 --> 00:47:05,662
Her Majesty is waiting for you.

331
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,935
[Sacrifice]

332
00:47:27,494 --> 00:47:37,494
Maybe I was being too selfish for
wanting us to be on good terms forever.

333
00:47:37,494 --> 00:47:42,745
I'm sorry for making you concerned.

334
00:47:42,745 --> 00:47:46,371
Have you heard the rumor?

335
00:47:50,494 --> 00:47:52,662
Yes, I did.

336
00:47:52,662 --> 00:48:00,287
I favored you, and you
even did a favor for me.

337
00:48:00,287 --> 00:48:06,383
However, Attendant Yang...

338
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:10,731
It's ironic that I'm telling you this.

339
00:48:13,494 --> 00:48:24,037
But... I think there are some relationships
that need to be broken against your will.

340
00:48:24,037 --> 00:48:30,620
I still want Prince Youngsung
to be my successor.

341
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:39,578
But, I'm having a hard time since Prince
Youngsung doesn't have many supporters.

342
00:48:39,578 --> 00:48:46,954
If your relationship becomes disclosed,

343
00:48:46,954 --> 00:48:55,494
it'll be a huge blow to both the
Imperial Court and Prince Youngsung.

344
00:48:55,494 --> 00:49:03,287
As a woman, it's hard for
me to ask you to do this.

345
00:49:03,287 --> 00:49:08,494
But, I have to because I need
to be more concerned about

346
00:49:08,494 --> 00:49:18,494
the Imperial Court than my
duties as a human being.

347
00:49:18,494 --> 00:49:21,076
Help Prince Youngsung so he can establish

348
00:49:21,076 --> 00:49:24,798
himself as a stronger member
of the Imperial Court.

349
00:49:28,037 --> 00:49:32,494
Do you understand what I mean?

350
00:50:28,121 --> 00:50:35,287
I feel uncomfortable fighting
with my son over a girl.

351
00:50:35,287 --> 00:50:38,704
You should let her go.

352
00:50:38,704 --> 00:50:42,494
You already won the competition.

353
00:50:42,494 --> 00:50:47,079
Now is not the time for you to quarrel
with Prince Youngsung over a silly girl.

354
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:50,079
You should throw out that useless toy.

355
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:51,787
Father!

356
00:50:54,246 --> 00:50:58,287
How can do think that way about
everything and everyone?

357
00:50:58,287 --> 00:51:04,037
Everyone's either useful or useless to you!

358
00:51:04,037 --> 00:51:05,704
That's not right!

359
00:51:05,704 --> 00:51:08,494
Idiot.

360
00:51:08,494 --> 00:51:13,494
Only those with power have the privilege
to view and handle people that way.

361
00:51:13,494 --> 00:51:17,829
That's how you viewed me, too.

362
00:51:17,829 --> 00:51:26,121
I was only a tool to help you fulfill
your expectations and ambition.

363
00:51:27,494 --> 00:51:30,494
You must've hated me.

364
00:51:30,494 --> 00:51:34,494
I'm not even your son.

365
00:51:34,494 --> 00:51:39,494
You... really scare me.

366
00:51:42,494 --> 00:51:45,204
Don't ever talk about that again!

367
00:51:45,204 --> 00:51:46,870
And, don't forget.

368
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:51,494
You're my son, and you need
to help me realize my dream.

369
00:51:51,494 --> 00:51:57,371
If you can control your feelings for now,
I'll give you the power of Emperor.

370
00:51:57,371 --> 00:51:59,787
So, what is your problem?

371
00:51:59,787 --> 00:52:02,494
No.

372
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:08,494
I can't deny my feelings like you can.

373
00:52:08,494 --> 00:52:19,371
I can't keep a secret like that for my goal,
and I can't think of people as tools.

374
00:52:19,371 --> 00:52:26,287
Since I'm not a royal, I can't be Emperor.

375
00:52:26,287 --> 00:52:28,787
Attendant Yang is not a toy.

376
00:52:28,787 --> 00:52:31,704
She's a person.

377
00:52:31,704 --> 00:52:35,494
She's the woman whom I love.

378
00:52:40,454 --> 00:52:42,954
Joon!

379
00:52:42,954 --> 00:52:44,494
Come back here!

380
00:52:48,494 --> 00:52:50,079
Joon!

381
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:54,121
I was just about to call you.

382
00:53:07,494 --> 00:53:09,494
Joon!

383
00:53:33,494 --> 00:53:41,787
Please... run away with me.

384
00:53:41,787 --> 00:53:45,494
Stop it, Your Highness!

385
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:58,745
You and Prince Youngsung
can never be together.

386
00:53:58,745 --> 00:54:05,494
Just give it up and take off with me, please.

387
00:54:05,494 --> 00:54:09,370
Your Highness, I don't know
what seems to be the matter,

388
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:11,494
but please leave me alone today.

389
00:54:11,494 --> 00:54:13,121
Miss Sooneui!

390
00:54:13,121 --> 00:54:15,494
Why are you torturing me?

391
00:54:15,494 --> 00:54:18,454
Torturing the other person isn't love.

392
00:54:18,454 --> 00:54:19,912
We just have different
ways of expressing love.

393
00:54:19,912 --> 00:54:23,495
I... don't like Your Highness' way.

394
00:54:23,495 --> 00:54:28,494
I don't ever want to see you again!

395
00:54:33,494 --> 00:54:36,954
I'm sorry.

396
00:54:36,954 --> 00:54:46,287
I have too much trouble of
my own to care for others.

397
00:54:46,287 --> 00:54:50,494
Just leave me alone, please.

398
00:55:04,495 --> 00:55:08,494
You have a call from Professor Alexander.

399
00:55:09,494 --> 00:55:12,494
Professor? Hold on, please.

400
00:55:12,494 --> 00:55:15,494
I'll put Her Majesty on the line.

401
00:55:20,494 --> 00:55:22,494
Thank you.

402
00:55:29,996 --> 00:55:31,495
Alex...

403
00:55:37,662 --> 00:55:43,494
Yes, I'm okay.

404
00:55:46,494 --> 00:55:57,494
What really makes me sad is that
you're suffering because of me.

405
00:56:17,494 --> 00:56:19,494
Empress...

406
00:56:24,494 --> 00:56:28,494
I'll call you back.

407
00:56:35,246 --> 00:56:39,204
Is it that hard for you?

408
00:56:39,204 --> 00:56:44,494
I don't know what's wrong with me.

409
00:56:44,494 --> 00:56:50,494
It's hard for me to let Alex go.

410
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:53,162
Empress...

411
00:56:53,162 --> 00:57:05,494
Mother... I don't deserve
to be the Empress, do I?

412
00:57:05,494 --> 00:57:16,079
I told myself over and over
I have to live as the Empress,

413
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:20,620
but I hate who I am right now.

414
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:23,996
Now is not the time to be shaken.

415
00:57:23,996 --> 00:57:27,662
You must be strong.

416
00:57:27,704 --> 00:57:32,495
You must remember your people.

417
00:57:32,495 --> 00:57:36,912
My people?

418
00:57:42,662 --> 00:57:52,494
But... I sometimes wish
I don't have to be who I am.

419
00:57:56,017 --> 00:58:07,962
Yang Sooneui! Yang Sooneui!
What's wrong? Are you okay?

420
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:43,643
It's been a while since you last came.
But, I'm afraid the place isn't ready.

421
00:58:44,476 --> 00:58:47,639
If I knew you were coming,
I would've made some preparations.

422
00:58:47,639 --> 00:58:56,637
It's okay. I just had the urge to come here.
Please don't tell my father about this.

423
00:58:56,637 --> 00:58:59,087
Yes, Young Master!

424
00:59:19,261 --> 00:59:22,163
Don't ever talk about that again!

425
00:59:22,163 --> 00:59:23,872
And, don't forget.

426
00:59:23,872 --> 00:59:28,469
You're my son, and you need
to help me realize my dream.

427
00:59:28,469 --> 00:59:34,031
If you can control your feelings for now,
I'll give you the power of Emperor.

428
00:59:34,031 --> 00:59:35,797
So, what is your problem?

429
01:00:07,726 --> 01:00:13,822
Did... Attendant Yang go somewhere?
She should be working now.

430
01:00:13,822 --> 01:00:19,003
She quit the Academy as
of today, Your Highness.

431
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:52,769
You said your goal was to graduate from
the Academy and become a chamberlain.

432
01:00:52,769 --> 01:00:54,261
What are you going to do now?

433
01:00:57,773 --> 01:01:02,329
I'll find something to do while
I take a break. Don't worry.

434
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,298
Should I just take you in and live with you?

435
01:01:07,949 --> 01:01:09,484
That makes no sense.

436
01:01:10,594 --> 01:01:14,669
Why doesn't it make sense?
I already lost the competition.

437
01:01:16,893 --> 01:01:18,372
Who said I would live with you?

438
01:01:18,372 --> 01:01:19,732
Then, what are you going to do now?

439
01:01:22,447 --> 01:01:27,448
If possible, I want to go back to college.

440
01:01:27,448 --> 01:01:30,952
I want to become a talented woman
who's recognized by the whole world.

441
01:01:32,005 --> 01:01:35,557
Who knows? Perhaps then, I might suit
you better even though I'm a commoner.

442
01:01:35,557 --> 01:01:41,957
We suit each other perfectly already!
I know you'll do well in anything you do.

443
01:01:41,957 --> 01:01:46,469
Of course... because you're
Yang Sooneui! You can do it!

444
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:47,952
I can!

445
01:01:53,004 --> 01:01:57,032
[Prince Hours]

446
01:02:26,791 --> 01:02:34,016
I brought some candles for you. They said
the lights will be back on in an hour.

447
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:36,966
It must've been so uncomfortable for you.

448
01:02:39,583 --> 01:02:43,392
I'm fine. Don't worry about it.

449
01:02:51,838 --> 01:02:55,699
Your call will be transferred to an
automated voicemail system...

450
01:02:57,191 --> 01:03:04,051
Grand Prince... Are you
sure nothing happened?

451
01:03:04,508 --> 01:03:07,869
Why is he doing this to me all of a sudden?

452
01:03:07,869 --> 01:03:10,529
He hasn't answered his phone all day.

453
01:03:14,361 --> 01:03:18,380
Everything's going to settle down
once he's appointed as Crown Prince.

454
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:20,922
What is with him all of a sudden?

455
01:03:29,829 --> 01:03:33,094
I still don't know where he is.

456
01:03:33,094 --> 01:03:36,094
I'm sorry.

457
01:03:36,094 --> 01:03:39,512
I'll find him soon, Grand Duchess.
