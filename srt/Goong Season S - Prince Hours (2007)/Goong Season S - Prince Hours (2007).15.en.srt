1
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,769
Do you know how worried I was about you?

2
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:10,769
I called you many times after I got back.

3
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:12,229
How come you never answered my calls?

4
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:13,769
What about the district palace?

5
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:16,769
How did you come to the Royal Academy?

6
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:17,769
One question at a time.

7
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:20,769
Just listening to you makes me tired.

8
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:21,769
What are you so worried about?

9
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:23,769
You even gave me my worry doll back.

10
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:27,937
Tell me what happened.

11
00:00:27,937 --> 00:00:29,187
I'll tell you later.

12
00:00:29,187 --> 00:00:31,396
You have to go to class.

13
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:36,769
Okay, let's talk later.

14
00:00:39,769 --> 00:00:43,062
Anyway, Yang Sooneui.

15
00:00:43,062 --> 00:00:44,769
Welcome back.

16
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:08,718
Good morning, Class. I've
brought you a new mate.

17
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:14,769
Hi, I'm Yang Sooneui,
the new student attendant.

18
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:17,769
Nice to meet you.

19
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:20,979
I'll be working at the
cafeteria during breaks.

20
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:23,769
I need a lot of customers if I want to
have good performance reviews.

21
00:01:23,769 --> 00:01:25,895
Please come by often.

22
00:01:25,895 --> 00:01:27,707
Thank you!

23
00:01:27,707 --> 00:01:32,233
And guess what class? She was
recommended by Her Majesty herself.

24
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:34,328
Welcome, Yang Sooneui.

25
00:01:56,187 --> 00:02:01,062
You were raised by your uncle
after your parents passed away

26
00:02:01,062 --> 00:02:04,769
when you were in elementary school?

27
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:07,769
Yes, Your Highness.

28
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,521
I never imagined anything like that

29
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:17,769
because of your fine
character and upbringing.

30
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:23,979
You should get married for
your belated parents' sake.

31
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:28,769
Are you nagging Madam Chamberlain now?

32
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:34,479
You don't need to stay
single like your superior.

33
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:44,769
The weather's getting warmer outside,
but we're all alone as three singles.

34
00:02:50,812 --> 00:02:56,145
I thought about what to
assign for the art part.

35
00:02:56,187 --> 00:02:59,769
You're changing the subject.

36
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:03,688
What did you come up with?

37
00:03:09,145 --> 00:03:11,020
What's the matter, Grand Chamberlain?

38
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:18,769
Your Highness, King Julius III
of Helvetia has passed away.

39
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:31,769
Culture, relativism, and prejudice.

40
00:03:35,584 --> 00:03:41,816
You may all be aware of the demise of His
Majesty, the King Julius III of Helvetia.

41
00:03:41,816 --> 00:03:44,978
The Helvetia monarchy
and my family, Esterhazy,

42
00:03:44,978 --> 00:03:48,726
have been exchanging art
for many generations.

43
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:54,506
So, I have to pay my respects
at the funeral ceremony.

44
00:03:55,637 --> 00:03:59,342
Further details shall be posted by my T.A.

45
00:03:59,342 --> 00:04:02,958
So please, keep close attention
on your assignments till I return.

46
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:22,229
Wasn't it supposed to be a group project?

47
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,729
Can he just leave without
assigning the groups?

48
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:27,688
We already have our groups.

49
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:55,769
It was you, right?

50
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:57,937
Did you ask Her Majesty to
write a recommendation letter for her?

51
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:00,770
I found this out today, too.

52
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:05,769
I think you should ask
Prince Youngsung, not me.

53
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:37,769
Ohhh, nice! She's my type.

54
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:40,562
She looks good in a school uniform.

55
00:05:40,562 --> 00:05:41,769
Stop it I said.

56
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:44,769
Why? She's not your
residential attendant anymore.

57
00:05:44,769 --> 00:05:48,769
I have a question.

58
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:51,769
I knew something was up!

59
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:55,769
If a girl says she's having
a hard time because of me,

60
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:56,769
does that mean she likes me?

61
00:05:56,769 --> 00:06:00,271
You can say that. So?

62
00:06:00,271 --> 00:06:03,769
So, I sort of told her that I like her, too.

63
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:08,769
But, she hasn't answered my
calls or called back since then.

64
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,769
She even canceled her homepage account.

65
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:14,562
I can't contact her.

66
00:06:14,562 --> 00:06:19,769
She did show up again, but what do you think?

67
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:20,769
She's being indifferent.

68
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:23,729
What did you say when you sort
of told her that you like her?

69
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:33,688
Huh? Well... that I'm in a bad situation.

70
00:06:33,688 --> 00:06:35,895
That I was sorry...

71
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,521
And there's nothing I can do for her.

72
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:38,769
That's it?

73
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:40,729
Still, I told her everything I need to.

74
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:42,770
What did you tell her?

75
00:06:42,812 --> 00:06:47,769
I still said that I wanted her by my side.

76
00:06:53,769 --> 00:07:04,769
That's what guys say when they want to
break up, but don't want to sound harsh.

77
00:07:04,769 --> 00:07:06,979
That's not what I meant.

78
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:10,769
She did say it's hard for her to face me.

79
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:12,769
That means she likes me, right?

80
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:16,396
Who is she anyway?

81
00:07:16,396 --> 00:07:18,145
Do you have a secret girlfriend?

82
00:07:18,145 --> 00:07:19,145
No.

83
00:07:19,187 --> 00:07:22,769
Come on! Tell us!

84
00:07:25,937 --> 00:07:29,312
You're the only son in five
generations of eunuchs?

85
00:07:29,312 --> 00:07:32,187
No wonder your name is Gwidong.

86
00:07:32,187 --> 00:07:37,354
It's a little corny, but they say
the name will bring longevity.

87
00:07:38,769 --> 00:07:43,769
But who cares? The Royal Academy
is sucking the life out of me.

88
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:46,769
Do they give you a lot of stuff to study?

89
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:50,853
Well... not that.

90
00:07:50,853 --> 00:07:56,729
We wear the same school uniforms,
but we're not the same students.

91
00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:00,769
Is that what you meant by assigned groups?

92
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:04,895
You wouldn't know because
Her Majesty's got your back.

93
00:08:04,937 --> 00:08:11,104
But, then again, maybe they'll
hate you more because of that.

94
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:17,020
In this place, he's the best
backup you can depend on.

95
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:33,062
Long time no see.

96
00:08:33,062 --> 00:08:34,769
Hi.

97
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,853
You've lost weight.

98
00:09:24,104 --> 00:09:30,020
Please leave a message after the beep...

99
00:09:40,586 --> 00:09:42,844
I'd like to make a reservation.

100
00:09:43,973 --> 00:09:46,288
I'd like to make a reservation.

101
00:09:46,804 --> 00:09:48,267
[A]

102
00:09:49,493 --> 00:09:52,244
Sure. Sure.

103
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:55,617
When would you like it for?

104
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,045
For tomorrow night.

105
00:10:00,062 --> 00:10:02,104
Are you playing a game?

106
00:10:02,104 --> 00:10:05,769
No, I'm studying English.

107
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:06,543
For how many people?

108
00:10:07,604 --> 00:10:10,437
Whoa, you are!

109
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:13,769
Hey! Eat while studying.

110
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:14,460
Six people.

111
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:31,646
[Congratulations on entering
the Royal Academy.]

112
00:10:31,646 --> 00:10:32,769
[Kang Hoo/Yi Hoo]

113
00:10:37,396 --> 00:10:39,145
[Delete? Yes / No]

114
00:10:57,138 --> 00:10:58,825
How long will you be staying?

115
00:11:04,722 --> 00:11:08,272
The tasks in Art and Wisdom
will be given simultaneously.

116
00:11:08,311 --> 00:11:13,201
Is there a special reason as to why
Her Majesty has chosen two tasks at once?

117
00:11:16,604 --> 00:11:24,374
Your Highnesses are probably aware of
the passing of King Julius of Helvetia.

118
00:11:24,374 --> 00:11:30,938
Since King Julius attended His Majesty
Emperor Ikjo's funeral ceremony,

119
00:11:30,938 --> 00:11:35,264
good foreign relations dictate
that Her Majesty attend likewise,

120
00:11:35,264 --> 00:11:37,407
so as to not be discourteous.

121
00:11:38,804 --> 00:11:42,639
However, because we do not have an
official heir while Her Majesty is away,

122
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:50,444
Her Majesty the Empress Dowager
will act as Regent.

123
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:53,329
According to Imperial Court principles,

124
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:57,173
it actually would be proper for one
of you to be acting as Regent.

125
00:11:57,512 --> 00:12:03,634
Therefore, with the two subjects in Art
and Wisdom, the latter task will be to assist

126
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:09,070
the Empress Dowager in her
duties as Regent while I'm away.

127
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:13,792
You can view it as a collaborative
preliminary exercise in ruling.

128
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:15,451
As Regent?

129
00:12:15,451 --> 00:12:17,603
That is right.

130
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:21,393
When Her Majesty the Empress Dowager
acts as Regent during this short period,

131
00:12:21,393 --> 00:12:31,616
both Your Highnesses will act as her agent,
to gain direct experience in daily duties.

132
00:12:31,616 --> 00:12:34,389
I believe Prince Moonsung has already
experienced some of these duties,

133
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:37,217
so I am sure you are familiar.

134
00:12:37,217 --> 00:12:40,336
Yes, I am familiar with it.

135
00:12:40,336 --> 00:12:48,318
Generally, Wisdom is to understand
all things right and wrong,

136
00:12:48,318 --> 00:12:51,649
having the ability and good sense
to judge and act when there is injustice.

137
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:56,405
Her Majesty decided on this task
because performing your duties

138
00:12:56,405 --> 00:13:00,731
in this capacity will be an
endless test of wisdom.

139
00:13:00,731 --> 00:13:08,566
Do you understand? Regent duties
will be your assignment for Wisdom.

140
00:13:08,566 --> 00:13:12,441
Then, what will be the test on Art?

141
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:25,336
Here is the information regarding

142
00:13:25,336 --> 00:13:29,420
the annual invitation of organizations
funded by the Imperial Court

143
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,629
and the concert held for them.

144
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:37,296
The art assignment will be
in relation to the concert.

145
00:13:37,296 --> 00:13:41,336
There have been many
problems with the concerts.

146
00:13:41,336 --> 00:13:47,629
Your assignment is to solve those problems.

147
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:52,587
If this works out, it'll be
meaningful for the Imperial Court.

148
00:13:52,587 --> 00:13:59,337
We've had this event for many years
to be "together with the people,"

149
00:13:59,337 --> 00:14:04,337
but many people point out that it's outdated.

150
00:14:04,337 --> 00:14:08,336
It's only a formality now.

151
00:14:08,336 --> 00:14:14,629
I hope you two can add a
fresh voice to this event.

152
00:14:14,671 --> 00:14:19,336
Which organization is invited this year?

153
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:22,336
That's a secret.

154
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:25,088
Pardon?

155
00:14:25,088 --> 00:14:29,336
Then, how do you expect us
to prepare for the concert?

156
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:34,629
That's the point.

157
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:35,796
Grand Chamberlain?

158
00:14:35,796 --> 00:14:38,462
Yes, Your Majesty.

159
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:42,336
All you need to do is prepare a
performance with the theme of "Art"

160
00:14:42,336 --> 00:14:47,336
without being confined by
formality or subject matter.

161
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:52,213
You may seek help from anyone you wish.

162
00:14:52,213 --> 00:14:56,337
You will meet the thirty judges who will view

163
00:14:56,337 --> 00:15:01,336
and evaluate the concert at the
concert hall on the day of the event.

164
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:05,336
Since I'm scheduled to arrive
the day before the concert,

165
00:15:05,336 --> 00:15:08,046
I, too, will attend the concert.

166
00:15:08,046 --> 00:15:09,838
Do you understand?

167
00:15:09,838 --> 00:15:14,336
To be honest, not really.

168
00:15:16,336 --> 00:15:21,336
By "fresh voice," do you
mean something modern?

169
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:25,336
I already told you not to be confined
by formality or subject matter.

170
00:15:25,336 --> 00:15:32,296
That's why I didn't explain
the definition of "Art."

171
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:42,336
I hope this assignment will
allow you two to think about

172
00:15:42,336 --> 00:15:45,921
what it means to be Crown Prince.

173
00:15:55,504 --> 00:15:59,336
We're back to the starting point.

174
00:15:59,336 --> 00:16:02,546
Do you think you can beat me?

175
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:08,671
You'll never beat me... because
I won't be careless anymore.

176
00:16:08,671 --> 00:16:12,879
Then, are you telling me that you
went easy on me until now?

177
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:18,129
No, I did my best.

178
00:16:18,963 --> 00:16:20,796
I just want you to know

179
00:16:20,796 --> 00:16:26,129
that having a lot of assignments
left is to your disadvantage.

180
00:16:39,444 --> 00:16:43,908
Imperial charity events and Regent duties...

181
00:16:43,908 --> 00:16:47,379
Prince Youngsung wouldn't
know anything about the events.

182
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:52,716
And, this is even truer
with being a Regent. But...

183
00:16:52,716 --> 00:16:55,374
The Empress Dowager worries me.

184
00:16:56,471 --> 00:17:04,899
At the last martial arts competition, she was
clearly biased toward Prince Youngsung.

185
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:09,324
What do you think?

186
00:17:12,172 --> 00:17:18,781
The Empress Dowager thinks and cares
for Prince Youngsung like her own child.

187
00:17:19,878 --> 00:17:26,260
However, when it comes to qualifications,
she thinks of Prince Moonsung very highly.

188
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,689
Didn't they say the elbow
always bends inward?

189
00:17:30,689 --> 00:17:35,361
She will probably favor Prince Youngsung
who's like her son over those qualifications.

190
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:40,280
How about paying her a personal visit?

191
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,258
To the Empress Dowager?

192
00:17:41,258 --> 00:17:47,363
Joon is in the palace, so it would be
your duty to pay her frequent visits.

193
00:17:47,363 --> 00:17:50,427
It would be good to see what's going, too.

194
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:01,081
My lord, Her Majesty's Imperial
correspondence has arrived.

195
00:18:16,438 --> 00:18:19,142
It's about the Crown Prince contest.

196
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:29,210
Prof. Alexander will also be attending

197
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:33,446
King Julius' funeral ceremony
as is Her Majesty.

198
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:41,301
A reunion in Europe... we cannot
make any mistakes this time.

199
00:18:41,301 --> 00:18:46,737
Yes. We're preparing for all
the head figures in Europe,

200
00:18:46,737 --> 00:18:48,166
including Austria and Helvetia of course.

201
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:55,618
Good... If it goes well, we'll
reach our final destination

202
00:18:55,618 --> 00:18:58,920
regardless of the Crown Prince contest.

203
00:19:13,746 --> 00:19:17,356
Aren't you done with your
duties at Jipyong Tower?

204
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,662
I've come to pay my respect
to the Court Lady Han.

205
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,403
I guess... You can see the two
Princes every day at the Academy,

206
00:19:25,403 --> 00:19:27,465
so there's no reason to come here.

207
00:19:30,556 --> 00:19:33,690
A special admission with Her Majesty's
recommendations...

208
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,318
It's really truly amazing.
I see you differently.

209
00:19:38,272 --> 00:19:40,773
Well, then...

210
00:19:40,773 --> 00:19:44,735
Joon's feelings toward you...
it's all genuine.

211
00:19:44,735 --> 00:19:48,696
I know Joon very well you know.

212
00:19:49,153 --> 00:19:53,075
There's nothing going on between Prince
Moonsung and me. Don't misunderstand.

213
00:19:53,075 --> 00:20:00,492
I think it's better to choose one of the two
instead of leading both of them on.

214
00:20:04,341 --> 00:20:06,651
You are going too far by the minute.

215
00:20:09,205 --> 00:20:12,252
Are you hoping Prince Youngsung
becomes Crown Prince?

216
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:14,914
Pardon?

217
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:19,991
Then you must've thought
about what's important...

218
00:20:19,991 --> 00:20:24,160
such as who will be helpful or be an
obstacle to Prince Youngsung.

219
00:20:24,793 --> 00:20:27,733
I don't know what you heard
and why you are doing this...

220
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:34,713
Right. Are these your notes?

221
00:20:34,713 --> 00:20:37,780
I was going to return them,
but I guess I'm a bit late.

222
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:36,678
Oh... When did you get here?

223
00:21:40,459 --> 00:21:45,771
Just now. I heard the Art and Wisdom
assignments were announced so...

224
00:21:47,917 --> 00:21:52,498
Ah, I fell asleep.

225
00:21:54,176 --> 00:21:56,562
[Grand Duchess Kang, 2nd Chair of
the Imperial Educational Foundation]

226

[Grand Duchess Kang Suspected of Imperial
Educational Foundation Embezzlement]

227
00:22:00,681 --> 00:22:05,320
This... these papers have
nothing to do with you.

228
00:22:07,381 --> 00:22:11,909
The truth you can gather from those papers...

229
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:17,414
is the reason why Your Highness made
the decision to become Crown Prince?

230
00:22:18,928 --> 00:22:20,420
I've observed you since you
first came to the palace...

231
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,107
even if you don't tell me, I know that much.

232
00:22:23,107 --> 00:22:27,221
Please pretend you didn't see it.
It's not even good news...

233
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:31,252
You wanted my help, but why do you
insist on doing everything alone?

234
00:22:31,252 --> 00:22:32,950
It might be dangerous.

235
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,311
That's why you shouldn't
be doing it all alone.

236
00:22:37,311 --> 00:22:42,106
Whether they were false charges or not,
it's a scandal that ruined a royal.

237
00:22:43,266 --> 00:22:51,274
It won't be easy. I cant help,
but my father might be able to.

238
00:22:52,613 --> 00:23:00,152
Well... there's a high probability
I can't give you what you want.

239
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,465
I'm disappointed. If you only
thought of me in those terms...

240
00:23:14,231 --> 00:23:19,973
I think the sooner your mother's
incident gets resolved, the better.

241
00:23:19,973 --> 00:23:23,679
In order to become Crown Prince,
having your mother's incident with you

242
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:29,912
can't be good... because
it's too important of a position.

243
00:23:34,794 --> 00:23:37,376
Mr. Prime Minister, I need
you to help Her Majesty.

244
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:45,229
Assisting Her Majesty is
what any citizen should do.

245
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:49,469
I'm glad to hear you say that.

246
00:23:50,185 --> 00:23:55,772
I felt bad for Saeryung last time.

247
00:23:55,772 --> 00:24:02,880
I'm honored that Your Highness is so
concerned about my humble daughter.

248
00:24:03,388 --> 00:24:08,945
But, you need not worry, Your Highness.

249
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:13,875
Although my daughter is young, she's strong.

250
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,744
I'm glad to hear you say that.

251
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:23,444
I think Saeryung is helping Prince
Youngsung a lot for the competition.

252
00:24:23,693 --> 00:24:25,816
I'm so proud of her.

253
00:24:25,816 --> 00:24:35,848
I'm just glad Prince Youngsung is
respectful of my daughter's opinions.

254
00:24:35,848 --> 00:24:42,281
Well, you can't force
two people to be together.

255
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:46,301
I guess Saeryung and Prince Moonsung
both belong to someone else.

256
00:24:48,817 --> 00:24:53,817
Your Highness, Grand Duchess Hyojang is here.

257
00:25:16,027 --> 00:25:21,943
I see more and more of you
in the palace nowadays.

258
00:25:21,943 --> 00:25:24,817
Forgive me, Your Highness.

259
00:25:24,817 --> 00:25:29,817
I'm just concerned about
living away from my only son.

260
00:25:30,817 --> 00:25:36,817
You can't blame a mother for missing her son.

261
00:25:36,817 --> 00:25:38,068
Have some.

262
00:25:38,068 --> 00:25:44,235
Excuse me, but I'd like to say something.

263
00:25:45,027 --> 00:25:50,444
Please keep in mind that people
will gossip if the Imperial Court

264
00:25:50,444 --> 00:25:53,817
and political powers become too intimate.

265
00:25:53,817 --> 00:25:56,110
You're right about that.

266
00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:05,152
But, since Emperor Ikjo passed
away, I'm the palace elder.

267
00:26:05,152 --> 00:26:09,110
I should at least know what's
going on with this country.

268
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:15,817
I can't just sit around
and waste people's tax money.

269
00:26:35,152 --> 00:26:41,817
This is an access card to
the Imperial Court Archives.

270
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:48,817
All the information in the Imperial Court
Archives can only be read by the monarch,

271
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:52,817
the Prince Regent who rules

272
00:26:52,817 --> 00:26:57,110
when something unfortunate happens
to the monarch, and Crown Prince.

273
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:01,817
Do you want to know I'm giving these to you?

274
00:27:01,817 --> 00:27:03,610
As Madam Chamberlain said,

275
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:07,193
only the monarch, one who
has the monarch's authority,

276
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:13,444
and Crown Prince can
go inside that place.

277
00:27:13,444 --> 00:27:17,068
That means there are many important
documents kept in there.

278
00:27:19,818 --> 00:27:24,694
I'm letting you two have access to this place

279
00:27:24,694 --> 00:27:32,817
because you'll need to read official
documents when you assist my mother.

280
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:37,985
I want you to take a glimpse of
the Imperial Court's history.

281
00:27:37,985 --> 00:27:40,277
Thank you, Your Majesty.

282
00:27:40,277 --> 00:27:49,193
I'd like you to aid my mother well to manage
all the affairs of the Imperial Court.

283
00:27:49,193 --> 00:27:51,152
Can I trust you two?

284
00:27:51,152 --> 00:27:54,152
I will do my best from
the bottom of my heart.

285
00:27:54,152 --> 00:27:57,817
I will do my best for this assignment.

286
00:27:59,027 --> 00:28:04,193
- Your Majesty, it's time to depart.
- I see.

287
00:28:04,193 --> 00:28:08,901
Empress, take good care of yourself.

288
00:28:08,901 --> 00:28:11,817
Yes, Mother.

289
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:28,817
Were all the performances like this Korean
classical music performance from last year?

290
00:28:28,817 --> 00:28:31,817
Yes, from what I remember.

291
00:28:31,817 --> 00:28:34,943
There's no point in watching this any longer.

292
00:28:34,943 --> 00:28:37,817
I'll go and talk to the Master.

293
00:28:58,817 --> 00:29:03,527
Your Highness, are you done watching?

294
00:29:04,817 --> 00:29:06,817
Somewhat.

295
00:29:06,817 --> 00:29:08,817
Uh...

296
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:16,985
I think Prince Moonsung already
thought of something.

297
00:29:16,985 --> 00:29:19,817
Really?

298
00:29:19,817 --> 00:29:22,817
I think I need more time.

299
00:29:57,817 --> 00:30:01,068
Touch the hearts of everyone.

300
00:30:20,077 --> 00:30:24,848
With its unique attempt to combine the
intense movements of break dancing,

301
00:30:24,848 --> 00:30:27,094
and the graceful artistry of ballet,
it's a sell out every night.

302
00:30:35,283 --> 00:30:40,325
It was so much fun and truly exciting.
I will remember it for a long time.

303
00:30:40,325 --> 00:30:42,983
- It was simply delightful.
- Yes, it was so much fun.

304

[B-BOY UNIT]
They were so cool.

305
00:30:45,471 --> 00:30:47,808
And it makes me want to learn it, too.

306
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:54,652
A B-boy performance?

307
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:55,817
Yes.

308
00:30:55,817 --> 00:30:57,985
I don't know about you,

309
00:30:57,985 --> 00:31:04,736
but I think a B-boy performance with
Korean classical music would be nice.

310
00:31:04,736 --> 00:31:07,817
I can't do that, Your Highness.

311
00:31:07,817 --> 00:31:08,610
Pardon?

312
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:17,817
Each member of the Imperial Orchestra
takes pride in what he or she does.

313
00:31:17,817 --> 00:31:20,777
We want to maintain our dignity.

314

Please understand.

Master!

316
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:29,027
I'm sorry if I offended you.

317
00:31:29,027 --> 00:31:29,817
However, I thought

318
00:31:29,817 --> 00:31:35,817
the most important thing about music
and dance is making people merry.

319
00:31:35,817 --> 00:31:41,943
Mixing with other genres can give you
a new experience.

320
00:31:41,943 --> 00:31:44,694
Forgive me.

321
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:49,817
I can't tell my orchestra to be just
the accompaniment for the B-boys.

322
00:31:49,818 --> 00:31:53,817
Please understand where I'm coming from.

323
00:32:49,817 --> 00:32:51,817
I see.

the future as well. Bye.

Yes, my lord.

Do you think a B-boy concert would be fun?

329

I don't know about that,
but it does go with the times.

330

Really?

331
00:33:32,817 --> 00:33:35,360
That's not good.

can't stand idly by for the art competition.

coming inside the palace.

336
00:33:56,277 --> 00:33:57,817
I'll look into it.

337

If I ask my theatre friends, I'm sure
we can find some solid dancers.

338
00:34:03,817 --> 00:34:07,817
What about the music?

339
00:34:07,817 --> 00:34:09,068
I have no choice.

340
00:34:09,068 --> 00:34:13,235
I wanted to mix the two genres,
but I don't think I can.

341

Tell them to select their own music.

342
00:34:15,652 --> 00:34:19,817
Wouldn't that shock everyone who's
used to the past performances?

343
00:34:19,817 --> 00:34:21,818
I don't know who the
evaluation committee will be,

344
00:34:21,818 --> 00:34:25,068
but anyone connected with
the Imperial Court is conservative.

345
00:34:25,068 --> 00:34:27,943
Don't try to break too far away.

346
00:34:27,943 --> 00:34:30,068
Saeryung has a good point.

347
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,569
What if they don't like
it from the beginning?

348
00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:38,817
Don't you get excited and happy when
you dance without a care in the world?

349
00:34:38,817 --> 00:34:45,817
Tradition and dignity are important, too,
but I want to go with my intuition.

350
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:51,817
I noticed what a great dancer
you are at the birthday party.

351
00:34:53,817 --> 00:34:58,027
I just think it's wise to be on the
same wavelength as the judges.

352
00:34:58,027 --> 00:34:59,817
Okay, let's do it!

353
00:34:59,817 --> 00:35:02,817
What about the stage lights and stuff?

354
00:35:02,817 --> 00:35:04,777
- I'll look into that.
- Okay!

355
00:35:06,817 --> 00:35:09,027
Thanks, everyone.

356
00:35:09,027 --> 00:35:11,901
Miss Saeryung, thanks.

357
00:35:14,777 --> 00:35:20,193
This is titled "The Magic Flute."

358
00:35:20,193 --> 00:35:24,360
It's from Mozart's last opera.

359
00:35:25,817 --> 00:35:27,277
What do you think?

360
00:35:27,277 --> 00:35:28,817
Maybe it's because I'm used to this tune.

361
00:35:28,817 --> 00:35:31,277
I like it.

362
00:35:39,777 --> 00:35:40,860
See you later.

363
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,985
See you later.

364
00:36:32,027 --> 00:36:40,817
I heard that Mozart was
inspired by Goethe's Faust.

365
00:36:40,817 --> 00:36:49,027
Only love can lead those who love to heaven.

366
00:36:49,068 --> 00:36:56,817
Goethe must've been happily in
love to write something like this.

367
00:37:51,818 --> 00:37:54,817
Don't you have class?

368
00:37:54,817 --> 00:37:56,817
I do.

369
00:37:56,817 --> 00:37:59,027
Then, why do you keep following me around?

370
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:00,943
When did I do that?

371
00:38:00,943 --> 00:38:04,360
I was just on my way.

372
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,817
I can't believe you didn't come visit me
once after coming to the Royal Academy.

373
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:08,817
Why would I want to visit you?

374
00:38:08,817 --> 00:38:14,817
Huh? Well...

375
00:38:14,817 --> 00:38:19,901
About what you said at Onyang...

376
00:38:19,943 --> 00:38:22,943
Oh, that.

377
00:38:22,943 --> 00:38:28,817
I just got frustrated because I had a
lot of things on my mind at the time.

378
00:38:28,817 --> 00:38:30,817
Just pretend I never said that.

379
00:38:30,817 --> 00:38:36,817
I'm sorry, but I can't.

380
00:38:36,817 --> 00:38:39,943
Just forget about it.

381
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:42,817
I'm sorry for making you concerned.

382
00:38:42,817 --> 00:38:45,569
It won't happen again.

383
00:38:45,569 --> 00:38:46,277
What?

384
00:38:46,277 --> 00:38:50,817
I must've been out of my mind at the time.

385
00:38:50,817 --> 00:38:52,817
It won't happen again.

386
00:38:52,817 --> 00:38:54,485
So, try to understand.

387
00:38:54,485 --> 00:38:57,817
You mean you didn't mean that?

388
00:38:57,817 --> 00:39:01,817
Huh? Yes.

389
00:39:04,817 --> 00:39:07,152
How can you...

390
00:39:07,152 --> 00:39:10,817
I can't believe how selfish you are.

391
00:39:10,817 --> 00:39:15,860
Don't you care about how I feel?

392
00:39:16,943 --> 00:39:18,817
Kang Hoo...

393
00:39:18,817 --> 00:39:21,817
You know what? Forget it.

394
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,817
Were you always this selfish?

395
00:39:23,817 --> 00:39:25,068
Why are you getting mad at me?

396
00:39:25,068 --> 00:39:26,817
Because I have a good reason!

397
00:39:26,817 --> 00:39:29,193
You only talk to Prince Moonsung in
the Royal Academy.

398
00:39:29,193 --> 00:39:33,736
You don't even talk to me anymore.

399
00:39:33,736 --> 00:39:37,817
I'm here to study, not to chat with you.

400
00:39:37,817 --> 00:39:41,110
Why am I having this conversation?

401
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,817
I have to go to class.

402
00:39:43,817 --> 00:39:48,110
I'm not done talking yet.

403
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,402
Forget it.

404
00:39:49,402 --> 00:39:51,817
You can talk to yourself.

405
00:39:59,121 --> 00:40:02,765
[Prince Hours]

406
00:40:08,402 --> 00:40:11,817
Your Highness! We have trouble!

407
00:40:11,817 --> 00:40:13,027
Why?

408
00:40:13,068 --> 00:40:15,152
Did you get a call from Minhyuk?

409
00:40:15,152 --> 00:40:17,068
No.

410
00:40:18,943 --> 00:40:22,319
The B-boys who were supposed to
perform today got into a car accident!

411
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:23,901
What?

412
00:40:23,943 --> 00:40:29,736
It's not a major accident,
but they can't perform.

413
00:40:29,736 --> 00:40:31,817
Minhyuk and Inwoo are
looking for other dancers,

414
00:40:31,817 --> 00:40:35,817
but it's hard to find anyone
on such short notice.

415
00:40:37,736 --> 00:40:39,817
We have 6 hours left.

416
00:41:15,027 --> 00:41:18,152
Her Highness the Empress Dowager is here.

417
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:37,319
I have an announcement to make.

418
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:48,527
Her Majesty planned on attending this
concert and the two Princes' competition,

419
00:41:48,527 --> 00:41:51,569
but there has been a change of schedule.

420
00:41:51,569 --> 00:41:59,027
Her Highness the Empress Dowager
will attend the competition tonight.

421
00:41:59,068 --> 00:42:07,485
On behalf of the Her Majesty the Empress,
I'd like to thank everyone for coming.

422
00:42:07,485 --> 00:42:09,277
As you already know,

423
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:18,985
today is the Imperial Court's annual event
as well the two Princes' competition.

424
00:42:19,027 --> 00:42:24,817
Please enjoy both the
concert and competition.

425
00:42:24,817 --> 00:42:26,610
By the way, Your Highness.

426
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:31,985
What are these kids doing here at
the solemn Royal Concert?

427
00:42:32,027 --> 00:42:42,027
I'll tell you who they are after the Empress
comes back for the final evaluation.

428
00:42:42,027 --> 00:42:44,235
I understand, Your Highness.

429
00:42:44,235 --> 00:42:45,817
Sit down, everyone.

430
00:43:09,152 --> 00:43:11,943
How did it go?

431
00:43:11,943 --> 00:43:14,985
Everything's taken care of.

432
00:43:15,068 --> 00:43:16,817
Good.

433
00:43:47,817 --> 00:43:49,485
Hey, let's go that way!

434
00:43:49,485 --> 00:43:50,817
Hurry!

435
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:27,817
I'm honored to show you
the concert I've prepared.

436
00:44:27,817 --> 00:44:32,817
Tonight's concert is focused on how
versatile our traditional instruments are.

437
00:44:32,817 --> 00:44:37,817
Our traditional instruments will
play a wide range of genres.

438
00:44:37,817 --> 00:44:40,817
Please sit back and watch

439
00:44:40,817 --> 00:44:42,817
how many different genres can be
covered by Korean classical music.

440
00:44:42,817 --> 00:44:51,817
And, please enjoy the harmonious blend of
western music played with Korean instruments.

441
00:45:46,817 --> 00:45:52,817
[Danger! Do not enter]

442
00:45:53,193 --> 00:45:55,235
What the...

443
00:45:55,235 --> 00:45:56,817
Turn around!

444
00:46:21,068 --> 00:46:23,901
Your Highness, you need to get ready.

445
00:46:23,901 --> 00:46:28,569
Prince Moonsung's concert is almost over.

446
00:46:28,569 --> 00:46:30,860
Why aren't they here yet?

447
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,485
Maybe something has happened to them.

448
00:47:02,817 --> 00:47:04,817
I'll be honest.

449
00:47:04,817 --> 00:47:08,527
I prepared a joint concert of Korean with
traditional music and a B-boy performance.

450
00:47:08,527 --> 00:47:14,817
But, both of them couldn't make it.

451
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,933
Your friends!

452
00:47:30,817 --> 00:47:33,710
So, I will replace it with a
performance I hadn't planned on.

453
00:47:34,068 --> 00:47:36,485
Aside from the Crown Prince competition,

454
00:47:36,485 --> 00:47:41,817
please sit back and watch the
performance put together by my friends.

455
00:48:00,817 --> 00:48:04,319
One, two, three.

456
00:48:05,235 --> 00:48:06,569
[The Incheon Boys' Strong Performance!]

457
00:48:06,569 --> 00:48:08,193
[Applause]

458
00:50:34,736 --> 00:50:37,736
Long time no see, Grand Prince.

459
00:50:37,736 --> 00:50:39,817
Oh, hi.

460
00:50:39,817 --> 00:50:44,485
It seems like you're getting
along well with the Empress.

461
00:50:44,485 --> 00:50:48,736
This is all thanks to you.

462
00:50:48,736 --> 00:50:52,943
It's hard to see you around ever
since you became the Prime Minister.

463
00:50:52,943 --> 00:51:00,817
As you know, I don't have
a lot of time on my hands.

464
00:51:14,931 --> 00:51:17,201
Hey, let's take a commemorative picture.

465
00:51:17,201 --> 00:51:18,475
Good, good, good, good!

466
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:22,934
Hey, hey, hey, what picture? Hey, how
would we ever come to a place like today?

467
00:51:23,192 --> 00:51:27,030
Hey, wait! Hwangga, Jodang, sit here.

468
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:29,297
Okay! One, two, three! Smile, kimchee!

469
00:51:30,707 --> 00:51:32,435
That's right!

470
00:51:32,435 --> 00:51:34,891
Entering Her Highness, the Empress Dowager!

471
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:50,012
Your Highness, these are my friends.
Pay your respects.

472
00:51:50,012 --> 00:51:52,546
- Hello, Your Highness!
- Hello, Your Highness!

473
00:51:52,546 --> 00:51:54,558
Yes! So, it was you guys.

474
00:51:54,558 --> 00:51:55,555
Yes, it was...

475
00:51:55,555 --> 00:51:58,336
Today's performance was very memorable.

476
00:51:58,336 --> 00:52:02,399
It's been a long time since I've enjoyed
myself as much as I have today.

477
00:52:02,399 --> 00:52:04,514
You are too gracious...

478
00:52:04,514 --> 00:52:09,520
But, Prince Youngsung, why
didn't the original team come?

479
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:15,957
They were in a car accident,
but I don't have all the details.

480
00:52:15,957 --> 00:52:20,999
A car accident... I wonder...

481
00:52:20,999 --> 00:52:25,204
Your Highness, I would like to be with
my friends outside of the palace

482
00:52:25,204 --> 00:52:27,333
since they came here on my behalf. May I?

483
00:52:27,959 --> 00:52:38,798
Hmm? What shall I do... I've already
asked Saeryung to dinner with us...

484
00:52:38,798 --> 00:52:40,444
With Saeryung?

485
00:52:40,444 --> 00:52:46,024
Your Highness, I apologize,
but may we have dinner next time?

486
00:52:46,024 --> 00:52:49,085
Truthfully, today's performance
was so much fun,

487
00:52:49,085 --> 00:52:52,899
I also would like to get to know
Prince Youngsung's friends.

488
00:52:54,849 --> 00:53:04,203
I won't keep you if you insist.
Then, we will have dinner next time.

489
00:53:04,203 --> 00:53:06,914
You are very gracious, Your Highness!

490
00:53:07,803 --> 00:53:12,891
I am in a very good mood today,
so I'm especially giving you my permission.

491

Saeryung home afterward.

Here you go, Miss Saeryung.

512
00:54:25,817 --> 00:54:29,817
Come on, Miss Saeryung wouldn't drink this!

513
00:54:29,817 --> 00:54:31,652
Oh, I see.

514
00:54:31,652 --> 00:54:35,817
It's alright. I don't enjoy drinking,
but I can hold my liquor.

- Please give me some.
- Whoa!

Remember, bottoms up for the first drink.

517
00:54:42,527 --> 00:54:43,817
- No, no, don't make her...
- Bottoms up!

518
00:54:43,817 --> 00:54:44,817
It's okay.

519
00:54:44,817 --> 00:54:47,319
Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

520
00:54:47,319 --> 00:54:48,817
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

521
00:54:48,817 --> 00:54:53,152
Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

522
00:54:53,152 --> 00:54:57,152
- Oooooh!
- Oooooh!

523
00:54:57,152 --> 00:54:58,817
This is good.

524
00:54:58,817 --> 00:55:00,485
- Can I have another drink?
- Whoa!

525
00:55:01,817 --> 00:55:05,319
Miss Saeryung! You're a good soju drinker!

526
00:55:05,319 --> 00:55:08,817
Fill it to the brim!

527
00:55:11,398 --> 00:55:13,706
Oh, yeah!

528
00:55:13,783 --> 00:55:14,908
Tastes good, right?

529
00:55:14,908 --> 00:55:17,027
Applause! Applause!

531
00:55:24,985 --> 00:55:26,694

Africa?

533
00:55:28,817 --> 00:55:30,319
Why all of a sudden?

534
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:37,817
She wanted to visit the elementary
schools being funded by

535
00:55:37,817 --> 00:55:42,110
the Imperial Court on
her way back from Helvetia.

536
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:46,817
You'll be acting as regents for
longer than we expected,

537
00:55:46,817 --> 00:55:53,817
but we can't blame her for looking
after the Imperial Court's project.

538
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:59,817
As of yesterday, the Arts contest
of the two-part assignment is over.

539
00:55:59,817 --> 00:56:03,817
The Empress will evaluate you
after she gets back.

540
00:56:03,817 --> 00:56:05,652
Starting from today,

541
00:56:05,652 --> 00:56:11,817
the real test on Wisdom begins, so you must
put all of your energy into acting as Regent.

542
00:56:11,817 --> 00:56:15,817
We'll keep that in mind, Your Highness.

543
00:56:22,817 --> 00:56:25,817
Miss Saeryung, what are you doing here?

544
00:56:25,817 --> 00:56:29,817
You can take a break from
being my study buddy today.

545
00:56:30,901 --> 00:56:35,652
I have something important to tell you.

546
00:56:35,652 --> 00:56:39,860
There's someone I'd like you to meet.

547
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:41,817
Who?

548
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:52,817
The former director at the foundation
in which your mother was involved.

549
00:57:44,817 --> 00:57:50,817
I heard you talked often about Grand
Duchess Hyoin when you drink, Mr. Choi.

550
00:57:50,817 --> 00:57:53,569
I never did that.

551
00:57:53,569 --> 00:57:55,818
Because you were the director, I'm sure
you looked at the account books concerning

552
00:57:55,818 --> 00:57:59,943
how the foundation's money was spent.

553
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:04,817
Just tell us anything about what happened.

554
00:58:04,817 --> 00:58:09,652
I don't remember anymore.

555
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,817
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

556
00:58:11,817 --> 00:58:17,943
I also know
that my mother is not a bad person.

557
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:20,818
Because I'm her son.

558
00:58:20,901 --> 00:58:27,817
No one knows a person better than her child.

559
00:58:27,817 --> 00:58:29,817
Please try to remember.

560
00:58:42,817 --> 00:58:46,319
Are you okay?

561
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:50,817
You took after you mother.

562
00:58:52,694 --> 00:58:57,817
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

563
00:58:57,817 --> 00:59:02,901
I can't help you at all.

564
00:59:02,901 --> 00:59:06,817
You came to the wrong person.

565
00:59:06,817 --> 00:59:12,027
I can't tell you anything even
if my life depended on it.

566
00:59:24,068 --> 00:59:26,235
What do you mean?

567
00:59:26,235 --> 00:59:30,985
How did Saeryung arrange a meeting with
the ex-director and Prince Youngsung?

568
00:59:30,985 --> 00:59:37,027
I don't know the details,
but it did take place.

569
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:40,817
No, no...

570
00:59:40,818 --> 00:59:45,817
That means the Prime Minister's office
had something to do with this...

571
00:59:45,817 --> 00:59:50,817
Maybe the Prime Minister is using
his daughter for his own schemes.

572
00:59:50,817 --> 00:59:52,277
Siyun.

573
00:59:52,277 --> 00:59:55,817
Yes, my lord.

574
00:59:55,817 --> 01:00:04,817
If something goes wrong, we might need
to shut the ex-director's mouth forever.

575
01:00:04,817 --> 01:00:08,817
I understand, my lord.

576
01:00:14,817 --> 01:00:17,817
You want a study buddy, Prince Moonsung?

577
01:00:17,817 --> 01:00:19,360
Yes, Your Highness.

578
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:23,817
I see. Who is it?

579
01:00:23,817 --> 01:00:25,817
Her name is Yang Sooneui.

580
01:00:25,817 --> 01:00:29,817
She received Her Majesty's special
recommendation to be a Student Attendant.

581
01:00:29,817 --> 01:00:33,817
Her Majesty's special recommendation?

582
01:00:33,817 --> 01:00:36,817
I never heard of anything like that.

583
01:00:36,817 --> 01:00:40,817
But, why do you need a study buddy?

584
01:00:40,817 --> 01:00:47,817
I know Prince Youngsung's
study buddy helps him a lot.

585
01:00:47,817 --> 01:00:51,817
If this is a fair competition, then we
must compete under the same conditions.

586
01:00:51,817 --> 01:00:54,817
I don't think you're the one

587
01:00:54,817 --> 01:01:01,817
who you should bring up the issue of
competing under the same conditions.

588
01:01:01,817 --> 01:01:10,319
After all, this competition is between two
people who are no match for each other.

589
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:16,152
But, if you want, I don't see a reason
why you shouldn't have a study buddy.

590
01:01:16,152 --> 01:01:17,860
Go ahead.

591
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:20,817
Thank you, Your Highness.

593
01:01:25,817 --> 01:01:29,277
I have a question.

594
01:01:29,277 --> 01:01:32,901
What is it, Your Highness?

595
01:01:32,901 --> 01:01:38,817
It's about your engagement to Saeryung...
What happened exactly?

596
01:01:38,817 --> 01:01:44,068
That was very unlike you.

597
01:01:44,068 --> 01:01:50,193
Forgive me, but I have nothing
to tell you concerning that.

598
01:01:50,193 --> 01:01:53,485
I shouldn't have asked you that.

599
01:01:53,485 --> 01:01:54,817
Very well.

600
01:01:54,817 --> 01:01:56,817

602

603
01:02:20,694 --> 01:02:25,610
I think we can help each other.

604
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:30,110
You can teach me about the common
folk's way of life and thoughts.

605
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:32,901
I can help you with your schoolwork.

606
01:02:35,943 --> 01:02:38,277
I can't do it.

607
01:02:40,817 --> 01:02:42,817
Is it because of Prince Youngsung?

608
01:02:45,817 --> 01:02:48,027
No.

609
01:02:48,027 --> 01:02:54,817
It's just that... I don't think it's
right for me to stay by your side.

610
01:02:54,817 --> 01:02:57,027
You have no choice.

611
01:02:57,068 --> 01:03:01,402
I already received
the Empress Dowager's permission.

612
01:03:01,402 --> 01:03:02,235
What?

613
01:03:02,235 --> 01:03:08,277
If you're so reluctant, then why
don't we put it this way?

614
01:03:08,277 --> 01:03:12,817
You can use me to get what you want.

615

to assist Her Majesty by her side.

I can help you.

619
01:03:32,817 --> 01:03:33,817

620
01:03:33,817 --> 01:03:38,444

we need from each other.

to say no, but I don't care.

had so much work to do.

take on some of that work.

Can I get back to them later?

629
01:04:29,817 --> 01:04:32,444
I'm fine. Please go ahead.

630
01:04:32,444 --> 01:04:36,027
I'll need at least an hour to read
everything you just gave me.

631
01:04:36,027 --> 01:04:41,277
I'll be back soon, Your Highness.

632
01:04:53,817 --> 01:04:56,652

That's where the Imperial Court
Records are kept, Your Highness.
