1
00:00:21,754 --> 00:00:23,169
Yang Sooneui!

2
00:00:27,169 --> 00:00:29,169
What are you doing here?

3
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:34,169
I've been ordered to work here
as an official palace attendant.

4
00:00:34,169 --> 00:00:37,170
Yeah, right! Stop pulling my leg!

5
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,629
That's good news, Attendant Yang.

6
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,169
Prince Youngsung and I will be living here.

7
00:00:47,169 --> 00:00:49,295
I see.

8
00:00:49,295 --> 00:00:50,169
Pardon?

9
00:00:50,169 --> 00:00:54,169
You mean you're a residential attendant?

10
00:00:54,169 --> 00:00:55,629
Hi, Joon.

11
00:00:58,545 --> 00:01:00,169
Hi.

12
00:01:19,962 --> 00:01:21,921
May I talk to Prince Youngsung?

13
00:01:21,921 --> 00:01:25,462
I'm Shin Saeryung, his schoolmate.
Can you call him for me?

14
00:01:25,462 --> 00:01:32,169
I'm sorry, he's out to take care of business.

15
00:01:32,169 --> 00:01:34,169
He said he'll be back soon.

16
00:01:34,169 --> 00:01:38,587
Would you like to wait outside?

17
00:01:40,504 --> 00:01:42,046
Here?

18
00:01:42,046 --> 00:01:50,962
I'm sorry, this residence isn't even
ready yet for His Highness to use.

19
00:01:50,962 --> 00:01:54,169
I can't let a guest in before he even...

20
00:01:54,169 --> 00:01:57,587
I guess I'll talk to him later.

21
00:01:57,587 --> 00:02:00,169
The place isn't ready yet?

22
00:02:00,169 --> 00:02:04,169
You're not very prepared for
an important resident, are you?

23
00:02:04,169 --> 00:02:06,169
What's your name?

24
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:07,671
Yang Sooneui.

25
00:02:07,671 --> 00:02:09,169
Attendant Yang.

26
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:11,629
See you around.

27
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:15,169
This was mine in the first place.

28
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,671
Your Highness.

29
00:03:43,088 --> 00:03:46,712
I heard that you helped
me get off suspension.

30
00:03:46,712 --> 00:03:53,169
I'm a little late, but thank you.

31
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:58,921
Oh, it's about what I said to Lady Yoo.

32
00:03:58,921 --> 00:04:01,754
Don't worry about it. It was nothing.

33
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:06,712
I wouldn't have become an official
attendant if you hadn't helped me.

34
00:04:06,712 --> 00:04:09,169
Really?

35
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,212
Then, I need something in return.

36
00:04:11,295 --> 00:04:12,169
What?

37
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,169
Do you always respond right away like that?

38
00:04:16,212 --> 00:04:18,169
You make me want to make fun of you.

39
00:04:20,295 --> 00:04:22,169
Then...

40
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:23,337
Wait...

41
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:32,169
Nothing. See you later.

42
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:35,169
I better get going now.

43
00:04:42,088 --> 00:04:44,837
What was he trying to say?

44
00:04:44,837 --> 00:04:46,169
Maybe it's that...

45
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:49,169
Hey.

46
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:51,169
Why do you look so surprised?

47
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:56,295
Congratulations on becoming
an official attendant.

48
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,337
I hope we get along.

49
00:04:58,337 --> 00:05:02,420
Same here, Your Highness.

50
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,170
We're both newbies here, but help me out.

51
00:05:06,212 --> 00:05:09,046
I can't make a mistake like I did last time.

52
00:05:09,046 --> 00:05:15,169
Right, I'll never take part in
something so reckless again.

53
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:17,046
Are you still mad?

54
00:05:17,046 --> 00:05:28,170
No, Your Highness and I should just
do what our status requires us to do.

55
00:05:28,253 --> 00:05:31,379
I better get going now.

56
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:33,169
Hold on.

57
00:05:33,253 --> 00:05:34,754
What now?

58
00:05:34,754 --> 00:05:41,004
Something happened between you
and Prince Moonsung that day, right?

59
00:05:41,004 --> 00:05:44,504
Even his shirt was off.

60
00:05:44,504 --> 00:05:50,169
That's... because he had ink on it.

61
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:53,379
I tried to wash it for him...

62
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:58,169
Still, something's fishy.

63
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:04,169
Your face turned red, and he
looked embarrassed, too.

64
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:14,169
Oh, my supervisor was
looking for us at the time.

65
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:17,212
I really have to go now.

66
00:07:45,862 --> 00:07:52,125
[Grand Atlas Historique]

67
00:08:18,004 --> 00:08:23,379
I knocked, but you weren't here.

68
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:28,169
What brings you here?

69
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:30,504
You have a lot of books.

70
00:08:30,504 --> 00:08:33,169
Can I read some?

71
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:36,169
Reading is my hobby.

72
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:39,169
It should be a part of
your life, not a hobby.

73
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:44,295
Reading needs to be more
than a hobby for a royal.

74
00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:48,783
I don't know how to say this,
but since we're both here...

75
00:08:48,783 --> 00:08:53,587
Let's put the past behind us and get along.

76
00:08:53,587 --> 00:08:55,337
What do you think?

77
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:26,504
Mr. Cho Sangki sent your
belongings from Incheon.

78
00:09:26,504 --> 00:09:28,169
Really?

79
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:53,587
His stuff is so much better.

80
00:09:53,587 --> 00:09:57,088
But then again, we've
been living different lives.

81
00:09:58,837 --> 00:10:02,169
Your Highness, do you want
me to help you unpack?

82
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:05,962
Stop saying, "Your Highness"!

83
00:10:05,962 --> 00:10:07,379
Just be yourself when we're alone.

84
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:15,629
No, I've been appointed to be a residential
attendant who serves both Princes.

85
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:18,545
Yang Sooneui, I'll take care of it.

86
00:10:18,545 --> 00:10:20,796
Yeah, right!

87
00:10:20,796 --> 00:10:24,169
You never took care of anything!

88
00:10:24,169 --> 00:10:25,170
See, that's more your style.

89
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:32,754
Besides, my name is Yang Sooneui!

90
00:10:32,754 --> 00:10:36,088
I like calling you Yang Soon-ee.

91
00:10:36,088 --> 00:10:37,418
It's tacky and fits you.

92
00:10:37,418 --> 00:10:38,963
You little...

93
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:03,725
When did you start practicing martial arts?

94
00:11:03,921 --> 00:11:06,169
You weren't into it before.

95
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:09,921
I started after my mom passed away.

96
00:11:09,921 --> 00:11:11,796
I become simple-minded
when I practice martial arts.

97
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:15,169
I don't have time to think
about other things.

98
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:17,169
I remember your mom.

99
00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:19,169
She was very pretty.

100
00:11:19,169 --> 00:11:22,295
All the other kids thought so, too.

101
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:28,004
Maybe I shouldn't have said that.

102
00:11:28,004 --> 00:11:29,379
It's okay.

103
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:33,169
She's right here with me.

104
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,295
What?

105
00:11:39,337 --> 00:11:41,587
Why are you looking at me like that?

106
00:11:41,587 --> 00:11:42,962
Like what?

107
00:11:42,962 --> 00:11:47,169
"Poor kid, you must've been sad.
You must've been lonely."

108
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:48,169
Something like that.

109
00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:51,169
How did you know?

110
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:54,169
Hey, I'm not an orphan.

111
00:11:54,169 --> 00:11:57,169
Stop pretending to be sad.

112
00:11:57,169 --> 00:12:00,212
After my mom died, I had Mr. Cho.

113
00:12:00,337 --> 00:12:02,587
Now, I have my relatives.

114
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:07,337
And, my relatives are big shots.

115
00:12:07,337 --> 00:12:11,170
Now that I think about it, I'm loaded.

116
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,545
How does it feel to live in the palace?

117
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,837
It was bound to happen someday.

118
00:13:02,837 --> 00:13:08,504
You finally were allowed to live
here because of your rival.

119
00:13:08,504 --> 00:13:10,754
You should thank Prince Youngsung.

120
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,671
The battle has begun.

121
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:18,169
I think it'll be interesting.

122
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:20,169
It won't take long.

123
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:23,169
That's what I want, too.

124
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:27,169
How long have you known that attendant for?

125
00:13:27,169 --> 00:13:28,671
Who?

126
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:34,170
No wonder you were more aggressive today.

127
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,921
What's the matter?

128
00:13:35,921 --> 00:13:39,629
Are you concerned about a mere attendant?

129
00:13:41,337 --> 00:13:44,169
I'm not concerned about an attendant.

130
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:47,169
I just don't like your attitude.

131
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:50,379
Are you interested in her?

132
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:54,253
She's fun, and cute.

133
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:32,169
Your Highness, it's time for P.E.

134
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:33,837
Come this way.

135
00:14:33,837 --> 00:14:35,712
Hey, Madam Chamberlain.

136
00:14:35,712 --> 00:14:39,420
Can I go to class without everyone
following me around?

137
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,170
I'm not in kindergarten.

138
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:45,462
This is embarrassing.

139
00:14:45,462 --> 00:14:49,169
I'm sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable.

140
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:56,587
But, Her Majesty has ordered me
to follow you as if I was your shadow.

141
00:14:56,587 --> 00:14:59,295
But, nothing bad has happened so far.

142
00:14:59,295 --> 00:15:02,004
Afternoon class at Bongre Building.

143
00:15:02,004 --> 00:15:05,169
That's where I saw people fencing last time.

144
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:08,337
Kang Hoo the hottie is a quick learner.

145
00:15:08,337 --> 00:15:11,169
A man's got to have his wits.

146
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:17,169
Welcome.

147
00:15:17,169 --> 00:15:19,169
Welcome, Your Highness.

148
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:21,255
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

149
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:26,169
This is my first P.E. class.

150
00:15:26,169 --> 00:15:30,169
This is the place, right?

151
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:34,671
Yes, but we're having class
at a different place today.

152
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:37,169
A different place?

153
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:38,671
Yes.

154
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,169
Yes, we just found out, too.

155
00:15:41,169 --> 00:15:45,046
This usually doesn't happen...

156
00:15:45,046 --> 00:15:46,504
Come with us.

157
00:15:46,504 --> 00:15:49,169
We'll take you there.

158
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:54,169
We have to learn this, too?

159
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:56,169
This is so not my style.

160
00:15:56,169 --> 00:16:00,169
We didn't like it at first,
but we got used to it.

161
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:05,295
I wouldn't have done this
if this wasn't a required class.

162
00:16:05,295 --> 00:16:07,712
But still...

163
00:16:07,712 --> 00:16:13,462
One, two, arabesque...

164
00:16:13,462 --> 00:16:16,169
Don't move!

165
00:16:16,169 --> 00:16:19,837
And... One, two, three, four.

166
00:16:19,837 --> 00:16:24,837
And one, two, three, four.

167
00:16:25,933 --> 00:16:30,697
- What is this?
- What's he doing here?

168
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:37,088
Your Highness?

169
00:16:37,088 --> 00:16:38,169
Nice to meet you.

170
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:40,420
What are you doing here?

171
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,169
To take your class.

172
00:16:43,204 --> 00:16:49,238
And one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight!

173
00:16:49,238 --> 00:16:51,669
One! Two! High up!

174
00:17:05,254 --> 00:17:08,945
Especially here in Korea, the
family tree goes way back.

175
00:17:10,661 --> 00:17:12,730
Who knows why we have to learn this?

176
00:17:15,258 --> 00:17:16,657
Who is Hoo?

177
00:17:20,508 --> 00:17:23,600
Knowing about our family tree
gives us a big picture

178
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,271
to all the questions we
have about who we are.

179
00:17:27,271 --> 00:17:34,221
Giddy yap! Giddy yap! Go forward!

180
00:17:41,212 --> 00:17:46,169
Okay, let's do it like they do
in Westerns. Hee-haw!

181
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:49,361
Oh, oh, oh, oh... hey, hey, hey...

182

Oh, oh, oh...

183
00:18:28,004 --> 00:18:31,962
Oops, it went straight to you. Sorry.

184
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:36,837
Why that little...

185
00:18:36,837 --> 00:18:39,504
Leave him alone.

186
00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:44,164
He started it! Heeyah!

187
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:52,004
Yoo Minhyuk! What are you doing?

188
00:18:52,046 --> 00:18:57,004
I didn't mean to hit you, but I'm sorry.

189
00:18:57,004 --> 00:19:02,129
What? Is that supposed to an apology?

190
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:03,169
Let me explain.

191
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:06,253
Are you trying to tell the
world you're a hater?

192
00:19:06,253 --> 00:19:10,671
You're a disgrace to the aristocrats' honor!

193
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:15,169
Just stay put, will you?

194
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:20,420
We don't care about our honor,
so you can keep it to yourself.

195
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:25,169
Get down from your horses. Now!

196
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:26,462
What's the matter?

197
00:19:26,462 --> 00:19:31,169
Minhyuk, what's wrong?

198
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:36,004
I don't know what this is
about, but just let him go.

199
00:19:36,004 --> 00:19:41,962
It's probably just a little prank.

200
00:19:41,962 --> 00:19:48,169
I'll let you get off this time,
but no more second chances.

201
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:55,796
I commend you for protecting your friend,
but you should pick better friends.

202
00:19:55,796 --> 00:19:59,587
I need to click with them first.

203

204
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:16,169
I think I owe you one.
I'll pay you back later.

205
00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:19,169
Why not now?

206
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:22,169
Teach me how this works.

207
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:26,837
Ouch, that hurts.

208
00:20:26,837 --> 00:20:29,169
Maybe I overdid it.

209
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,066
Ah! Ow...

210
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:41,575
Ow...

211
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:49,169
I can't ask anyone to put it on for me.

212
00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:52,170
I can log on the internet
through my TV, right?

214
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:03,169

219
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:36,169
What's this smell?

220
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:40,253
I'm doing yoga.

221
00:21:40,253 --> 00:21:42,420
Yoga?

222
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,169
That's yoga?

223
00:21:45,169 --> 00:21:51,169
It's a new type of yoga. This is
supposed to help with blood circulation.

What's up?

225
00:21:57,337 --> 00:21:59,462
Aren't you going to the royal recital?

226
00:21:59,545 --> 00:22:01,379
You should get dressed.

227
00:22:01,379 --> 00:22:05,169
You're right! The royal recital!

228
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:20,169

Your Highness.

00:22:44,169 --> 00:22:47,169
You'll be late for school.

233
00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:50,004
Please get up.

234
00:22:53,587 --> 00:22:56,379

235
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:00,379
Okay, fine.

236
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:04,754
I only have Anthropology today.

237
00:23:04,754 --> 00:23:10,169
I can't understand it
because it's in English anyway.

238
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:13,169
Do I really have to go?

239
00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:15,420
Your Highness.

240

Yang Sooneui, I'm sick.

249
00:24:06,253 --> 00:24:07,796
You're sick?

250
00:24:07,796 --> 00:24:09,754
Yes.

251
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:24,169
You're right!

252
00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:26,587
It's hot, huh?

253
00:24:26,587 --> 00:24:31,169
I think I'm fatigued from playing polo.

254
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:32,504
Are you cold?

255
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:35,379
Yes, I'm cold.

256
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:39,169
How's your throat?

257
00:24:43,379 --> 00:24:49,629
Tell Madam Chamberlain that
I can't go to school today.

258
00:24:49,629 --> 00:24:55,629
I don't want her to see me like this.
Tell her not to come inside.

259

What should I do?

260
00:25:01,796 --> 00:25:06,169
I'll go and get the Royal Physician.

261
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:08,169
What? Wait!

262
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:10,169
Wait a minute!

263
00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:13,169
Why?

264
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:19,921
I can't stand doctors and medicine!

265

Powdered medicine tastes bitter!

00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:05,169
I think your fever's gone down.

269

I'm cold.

Why is my heart breaking?

271
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,295
Maybe he's sick because he's lonely.

272
00:26:35,169 --> 00:26:39,504
Did you select a court lady
to educate the Prince?

273
00:26:39,504 --> 00:26:41,629
Yes, Your Majesty.

274
00:26:41,629 --> 00:26:44,169
How about Lady Han?

275
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:51,169
The late Emperor selected
her to be Your Majesty's instructor.

276
00:26:51,169 --> 00:26:57,587
Oh, no! Not her!

277
00:26:57,587 --> 00:27:01,169
According to the Office of
the Censor-General...

278
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:06,169
during King Jungjo's days,
a nanny should be gentle.

279
00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:16,169
Lady Han is dignified alright,
but she's not gentle.

280
00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:26,169
But, I can't find a better
person to teach the Prince.

281
00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:29,169
I guess we don't have a choice.

282
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:32,169
Poor Prince.

283
00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:34,212
Lady Han is coming!

284
00:28:55,504 --> 00:28:57,169
Which color is that?

285
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:59,379
Huh?

286
00:28:59,379 --> 00:29:03,587
You should refrain
from wearing dark lipstick.

287
00:29:03,712 --> 00:29:08,754
And, keep your hands clean.

288
00:29:10,169 --> 00:29:13,587

polish are not allowed!

Yes.

Where's the other one?

292
00:29:19,169 --> 00:29:28,169
Attendant Yang is... uh...
at Prince Youngsung's residence...

293
00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:31,796

instead of going to school?

295
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:43,169
Yes.

296
00:30:00,169 --> 00:30:02,169
I have to go.

297
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:04,169
You do?

298
00:30:07,253 --> 00:30:09,545

299
00:30:09,545 --> 00:30:12,462
- My stomach...
- Your stomach?

300
00:30:12,462 --> 00:30:15,169
- I feel nauseous.
- Really?

301
00:30:18,337 --> 00:30:23,088
I'll get the Royal Physician!

302
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:25,169
No!

303
00:30:26,379 --> 00:30:28,027

304
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:32,039
- Ah!
- Ah! Ow...

305
00:30:33,462 --> 00:30:37,712
- What are you doing?
- Who told you to run like that?

306
00:30:37,712 --> 00:30:38,629
What?

307
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:42,337
You wench! Get up immediately!

308
00:30:47,462 --> 00:30:53,169
How dare you show such scandalous behavior!

309
00:30:53,169 --> 00:30:57,169
Well, you see...

310
00:30:57,169 --> 00:30:59,754
I'm sorry, Lady.

311
00:30:59,754 --> 00:31:03,212
Yo, lady...

312
00:31:03,212 --> 00:31:05,169
"Yo, lady"?

313
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:09,129
You shouldn't say that, Your Highness.

314
00:31:09,129 --> 00:31:14,754
I don't know who you are,
but this girl didn't do anything wrong.

315
00:31:14,754 --> 00:31:16,837
This girl?

316
00:31:16,837 --> 00:31:20,462
His Highness told me that he's sick, so...

317
00:31:23,169 --> 00:31:27,046
I'll let you go this time...

318
00:31:27,046 --> 00:31:32,379
but you'll be kicked out
if this happens again.

319
00:31:32,379 --> 00:31:34,295
Understand?

320
00:31:34,295 --> 00:31:36,169
Yes, ma'am.

321
00:31:54,504 --> 00:32:03,212
Lady Han will be in charge of
your education from now on.

322
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:09,169
She has been the Court Lady...

323
00:32:09,169 --> 00:32:19,169
in charge of education until Her
Majesty ascended to the throne.

324
00:32:19,169 --> 00:32:21,754
Let me introduce myself.

325
00:32:21,754 --> 00:32:25,169
I'm Lady Han.

326
00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:33,169
I was at Jangseowon until Her Majesty
ordered me to serve you.

327
00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:35,253
Oh, hello.

328
00:32:35,295 --> 00:32:42,169
But, you see, I have body chills
and a headache right now...

330
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:46,046
Yes, Lady.

331
00:32:46,046 --> 00:32:51,712
Does Her Majesty know that
His Highness is sick?

332
00:32:53,796 --> 00:32:59,169
Uh... no, she does not.

333
00:32:59,169 --> 00:33:04,879
You haven't reported this to Her Majesty yet?

334
00:33:04,879 --> 00:33:10,169
How can you be so inconsiderate
when Her Majesty is so concerned...

335
00:33:10,169 --> 00:33:14,420
with the Prince's wellbeing?

336
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:22,169
I will go and tell Her Majesty
how lazy you all are!

337
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:25,169
Yo!

338
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,169
I mean, Lady!

339
00:33:27,169 --> 00:33:29,462
Your Highness.

340
00:33:29,462 --> 00:33:35,169
I feel so much better now.

341
00:33:35,169 --> 00:33:42,504
You're a little late, but would
you like to go to school?

342
00:33:42,504 --> 00:33:48,169
Yes, I should.

343
00:33:48,169 --> 00:33:50,088
I will.

344
00:33:51,169 --> 00:33:55,169
You've been suspended after
helping His Highness escape.

345
00:33:55,169 --> 00:34:00,169
- You still haven't got yourself together?
- Forgive me.

346
00:34:00,169 --> 00:34:02,169

and second in line to the throne reside.

348
00:34:10,504 --> 00:34:15,629
You should be more prudent here.

349
00:34:15,629 --> 00:34:17,169
I'll keep that in mind.

350
00:34:17,169 --> 00:34:24,129
You will be punished
if you make another mistake.

351
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:25,420
Understand?

352
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:28,169
Yes, Lady Han.

353
00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:36,337
I can't believe this is Joon's room.

354
00:34:39,169 --> 00:34:43,004
I wonder when he can go
to the Crown Prince's Palace.

363
00:36:25,504 --> 00:36:30,169
You like coming to the royal recitals?

364
00:36:30,169 --> 00:36:35,169
Yes, I've watched them every year
since I was at Royal Middle School.

365
00:36:35,169 --> 00:36:41,088
I especially like the Chinese poetry
Your Highness recited every year.

366
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:44,462
They were beautiful,
even to a young kid like me.

367
00:36:44,504 --> 00:36:48,169
Really?

368
00:36:48,169 --> 00:36:51,169
Why don't I recite it then?

369
00:36:54,169 --> 00:36:57,212
Chun Wuam writes in his book,

370
00:36:57,212 --> 00:37:01,169
The spring rain falls on the pond.

00:37:01,169 --> 00:37:03,169
Gyeong Han writes on the horse,

372
00:37:03,169 --> 00:37:06,671
The cold wind sinks into the tent.

373
00:37:06,671 --> 00:37:08,837
Sew a small cotton covering.

374
00:37:08,837 --> 00:37:12,504
I lean on the screen because of my grief.

375
00:37:16,088 --> 00:37:18,712
The long sword spells disaster.

376
00:37:18,712 --> 00:37:22,420
The apricot blossoms fall on the fence.

377
00:37:25,169 --> 00:37:28,879
You are so young, yet so
good at Chinese poetry.

378
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:30,754
Very impressive.

379
00:37:30,754 --> 00:37:32,253
I'm honored, Your Highness.

380
00:37:32,253 --> 00:37:38,504
You two seem like a match made in heaven.

381
00:37:40,169 --> 00:37:42,420
What do you think, Your Majesty?

382
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,169
I agree.

383
00:37:46,169 --> 00:37:48,129
A match made in heaven?

384
00:37:54,088 --> 00:37:59,461
I heard that your family funds musicians.

385
00:37:59,461 --> 00:38:02,047
I feel very honored that
you know about my family.

386
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,169
Your Majesty.

387
00:38:28,169 --> 00:38:30,504
Long time no see, Grand Prince.

388
00:38:30,504 --> 00:38:35,169
You must've been shocked to see
the protesters at the concert hall.

389
00:38:35,169 --> 00:38:46,169
Don't worry. I learned my lesson.

390
00:38:46,169 --> 00:38:52,169
I will no longer tolerate those
who challenge my authority.

391
00:38:52,169 --> 00:38:55,629
Of course you shouldn't, Your Majesty.

392
00:38:55,629 --> 00:39:02,379
However, prudence is not
limited to the clergy.

393
00:39:02,379 --> 00:39:03,712
Remember...

394
00:39:03,712 --> 00:39:12,004
modesty and compromise can
ease a person's troubled mind.

395
00:39:12,004 --> 00:39:15,504
I better get going, so you can rest.

396
00:39:35,462 --> 00:39:37,169
Your Highness Empress Dowager...

397
00:39:37,169 --> 00:39:42,169
these are the attendants
for Jipyoung Tower.

398
00:39:45,921 --> 00:39:49,169
Did you summon us, Your Highness?

399
00:39:49,169 --> 00:40:04,169
I summoned you to remind you to do your
best in taking care of the Prince and...

400
00:40:04,169 --> 00:40:10,587
Hmm. Isn't she the child who helped Prince
Youngsung leave the palace last time?

401
00:40:13,169 --> 00:40:15,420
Yes, she is.

402
00:40:17,295 --> 00:40:19,212
Forgive me, Your Highness.

403
00:40:19,212 --> 00:40:23,169
I regret it deeply.

404
00:40:23,169 --> 00:40:25,169
Listen.

405
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:28,169
I redeemed you...

406
00:40:28,169 --> 00:40:33,169
because Prince Youngsung was
so eager to keep his promise.

407
00:40:33,169 --> 00:40:40,169
You should serve the Prince wholeheartedly.

408
00:40:40,169 --> 00:40:42,504
I will.

409
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:52,879
- Let's go.
- Oh, my gosh!

410
00:40:52,879 --> 00:40:55,879
The troublemaker is better
than I gave him credit for.

411
00:40:55,879 --> 00:40:58,169
I thought he was an immature punk.

412
00:40:58,169 --> 00:41:01,629
He's not that bad.

413
00:41:01,629 --> 00:41:05,504
You're protecting him because
he's your elementary school friend.

414
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:10,170
Remember how mad you were
when you first saw him?

415
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:15,379
Be more consistent.

416
00:41:15,379 --> 00:41:19,169
You went out with that troublemaker
in elementary school, right?

417
00:41:19,169 --> 00:41:20,837
You did!

418
00:41:20,837 --> 00:41:23,169
Did you?

419
00:41:42,587 --> 00:41:47,169
Your Highness, the recital is over.

420
00:41:47,169 --> 00:41:49,212
You should go back.

421
00:41:49,295 --> 00:41:51,754
Why did you lie?

422
00:41:51,754 --> 00:41:53,004
What?

423
00:41:53,004 --> 00:41:57,169
You and Prince Youngsung
are childhood friends.

424
00:41:57,169 --> 00:42:00,169
How long are you going to keep it a secret?

425
00:42:02,545 --> 00:42:09,169
I thought I might get kicked
out if the elders found out.

426
00:42:09,212 --> 00:42:14,169
I didn't lie. I just didn't tell them.

427
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:20,253
I don't think you can stay at
Jipyoung Tower if they find out.

428
00:42:20,253 --> 00:42:28,169
Your Highness, can you just
pretend you didn't find out?

429
00:42:28,169 --> 00:42:33,169
Do you want to stay at Jipyoung
Tower because of him?

430
00:42:33,169 --> 00:42:39,169
No... this is my first job
as an official attendant.

431
00:42:39,169 --> 00:42:43,169
I want to do my best.

432
00:42:43,169 --> 00:42:45,462
Really?

433
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:47,921
Is that all?

434
00:42:47,921 --> 00:42:49,921
Yes.

435
00:42:55,504 --> 00:42:57,169
I see.

436
00:42:57,169 --> 00:43:02,170
Because it's you and not somebody else,
I'll do you a favor and let it slide.

437
00:43:04,337 --> 00:43:07,545
Thank you, Your Highness.

438
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:10,169
But, you should be careful.

439
00:43:10,169 --> 00:43:14,046
You'll be in trouble if the elders find out.

440
00:43:14,046 --> 00:43:15,253
You know that, right?

441
00:43:15,253 --> 00:43:17,295
Yes.

442
00:43:54,169 --> 00:43:59,169
You were surprised by what the
Empress Dowager said, right?

443
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:03,462
"A match made in heaven"? Yes.

444
00:44:03,462 --> 00:44:07,169
Royals usually marry at an early age.

445
00:44:07,169 --> 00:44:10,504
Your Highness probably will, too.

446
00:44:10,504 --> 00:44:14,169
Who am I going to marry?

447
00:44:14,169 --> 00:44:17,545
The Imperial Court will decide, of course.

448
00:44:17,545 --> 00:44:19,420
Really?

449
00:44:21,253 --> 00:44:24,169
You must care a lot about Attendant Yang.

450
00:44:24,169 --> 00:44:25,796
You mean Yang Sooneui?

451
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:30,253
She's not just an attendant. She's
my friend from elementary school.

452
00:44:30,253 --> 00:44:35,169
I can't let her get fired because of me.

453
00:44:35,169 --> 00:44:37,379
Oh, I see.

454
00:44:40,587 --> 00:44:46,169
No wonder people call her "Malignant Virus."

455
00:44:46,169 --> 00:44:50,295
Her mere existence is a threat
to the entire department.

456
00:44:50,295 --> 00:44:55,295
What should I do? I'm already her target.

457
00:44:55,379 --> 00:45:00,545
Even your doll won't do you any good now.

458
00:45:00,545 --> 00:45:04,169
What was that embarrassing
scene you made today?

459
00:45:04,169 --> 00:45:06,169
Did you two go out when you were little?

460
00:45:06,169 --> 00:45:08,671
What? Are you crazy?

461
00:45:08,671 --> 00:45:12,796
Why would I go out with
Kang Hoo, the thermal boy?

462
00:45:12,796 --> 00:45:17,169
Then, why are you so nice to him?
Do you like serving your classmate?

463
00:45:17,169 --> 00:45:21,170
He's a Prince, and I'm his maidservant.
Of course I don't like it.

464
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:26,796
But... come to think of it, he's all alone.

465
00:45:26,796 --> 00:45:28,295
He'll be lonely.

466
00:45:28,295 --> 00:45:32,879
Ha! Why feel pity?

467
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:14,712
Attendant Yang! Why are you so forgetful?

468
00:46:14,796 --> 00:46:16,582
It's rubbed off on me, too!

469
00:46:16,582 --> 00:46:22,169
- That's...
- Be quiet!

470
00:46:22,169 --> 00:46:24,962
Attendant Yang.

471
00:46:24,962 --> 00:46:26,545
Yes?

472
00:46:28,169 --> 00:46:30,169
Your Highness.

473
00:46:30,169 --> 00:46:33,169
Come with me. I have a request.

474
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,879
Come on.

475
00:46:50,712 --> 00:46:52,941
Why the library?

476
00:46:52,941 --> 00:46:55,170
I need to find research for the Academy.

477
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:59,504
I don't know anything about the Royal Court.

478
00:47:15,169 --> 00:47:18,169
This wasn't the door.

479
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:21,169
- Bye.
- Why?

480
00:47:21,169 --> 00:47:22,754
I can't go inside.

481
00:47:22,754 --> 00:47:27,169
Only royalty and students of
the Royal Academy can go inside.

482
00:47:27,169 --> 00:47:30,587
Who cares. I've never
been in a library before.

483
00:47:30,587 --> 00:47:33,169
Come with me.

484
00:47:33,169 --> 00:47:36,169
Gosh, he's so irritating.

485
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:43,169
I'm sorry. It's against our policy.

486
00:47:43,169 --> 00:47:46,462
She's my residential attendant.
I can guarantee her status.

487
00:47:46,629 --> 00:47:48,587
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

488
00:47:48,712 --> 00:47:51,169
Is she a student attendant
at the Royal Academy?

489
00:47:51,169 --> 00:47:56,169
What's that?

490
00:47:56,337 --> 00:48:01,796
Some attendants are selected
to study at the Royal Academy.

491
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:07,754
They can come in here, but she cannot.

492
00:48:09,295 --> 00:48:12,169
Don't you trust me more than a building pass?

493
00:48:12,169 --> 00:48:15,004
What? Well...

494
00:48:15,004 --> 00:48:17,712
I'm bringing her in with my authority.

495
00:48:17,712 --> 00:48:21,169
Attendant Yang, come in.

496
00:48:23,169 --> 00:48:26,420
It's okay. Hurry up.

497
00:48:50,504 --> 00:48:56,169
[10th year of the Changhwa Era - Grand Prince
Hyoin Yi Yoon marries Kang Sooyoung]

498
00:49:10,169 --> 00:49:14,962
Andong's culture of nobility?

499
00:49:14,962 --> 00:49:16,712
I'll look it up.

500
00:49:16,712 --> 00:49:19,712
You can look around.

501
00:49:30,712 --> 00:49:33,796
I found it!

502
00:49:55,706 --> 00:49:57,514
I'm not sure if this will do it.

503
00:50:00,513 --> 00:50:04,996
Yang Sooneui... There's
something I want to ask you.

504
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:07,230
What is it?

505
00:50:08,414 --> 00:50:09,769
Do you like Prince Moonsung?

506
00:50:10,811 --> 00:50:11,311
What?

507
00:50:13,915 --> 00:50:16,125
Just say so if you do!

508
00:50:17,233 --> 00:50:18,671
I can connect you two.

509
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:21,274
Are you kidding me?

510
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:25,077
So why are you looking down?

511
00:50:26,097 --> 00:50:27,400
Look at me straight in the eye!

512
00:50:27,712 --> 00:50:29,322
Look at me and tell me.

513
00:50:30,907 --> 00:50:36,241
Why are you doing this? If you're no longer
looking for books, then I'll leave now.

514
00:50:36,754 --> 00:50:37,723
Yang Sooneui!

515
00:50:38,199 --> 00:50:43,792
I asked you to organize this yesterday,
didn't I? Huh? My goodness...

516
00:50:43,792 --> 00:50:46,896
I told you the flowers must be
changed properly, didn't I?

517
00:50:46,896 --> 00:50:48,631
I'm sorry...

518
00:50:50,006 --> 00:50:52,435
What the heck were you doing until now, huh?

519
00:50:52,435 --> 00:50:53,356
I was...

520
00:50:53,356 --> 00:50:56,895
If you keep this up, I'll kick
you out of the palace!

521
00:50:58,397 --> 00:51:01,373
- Sir!
- Just a minute.

522
00:51:06,744 --> 00:51:07,989
Your Highness...

523
00:51:14,883 --> 00:51:19,313
Isn't Attendant Yang's most important duty
to take care of me and Prince Moonsung?

524
00:51:19,515 --> 00:51:22,168
Of course, it most certainly is.

525
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:26,030
I asked her to find some books for me,

526
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:29,672
But, if you scold her, doesn't that
put me in an awkward position?

527
00:51:29,708 --> 00:51:34,123
I had no idea... Forgive me, Your Highness!

528
00:51:34,978 --> 00:51:36,418
Attendant Yang, be on your way.

529
00:51:41,338 --> 00:51:43,854
Yes, Your Highness.

530
00:51:48,835 --> 00:51:52,793
- Eunuch Kwak, your tie is really stylish.
- Thank you.

531
00:51:55,126 --> 00:51:55,626
Hello.

532
00:51:58,501 --> 00:52:01,450
Do you know Prince Youngsung and
Attendant Yang are childhood friends?

533
00:52:04,114 --> 00:52:05,365
How did you find out?

534
00:52:07,435 --> 00:52:10,087
Are you that close to Prince Youngsung now?

535
00:52:11,263 --> 00:52:13,889
Then, what about you and Attendant Yang.
Aren't you a bit chummy?

536
00:52:14,469 --> 00:52:15,805
I found out accidentally.

537
00:52:16,646 --> 00:52:21,688
Is that so? I think those two
have an odd relationship.

538
00:52:22,043 --> 00:52:26,115
It's not easy running into a childhood
friend... and in the palace no less.

539
00:52:35,888 --> 00:52:37,289
Where did she disappear to?

540
00:53:06,241 --> 00:53:11,703
Thanks for having my punishment lifted.

541
00:53:11,703 --> 00:53:15,013
I had no idea.

542
00:53:15,013 --> 00:53:18,526
Hey, I said I'd take care of it, didn't I?

543
00:53:21,551 --> 00:53:23,940
You still have this?

544
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:25,870
Still?

545
00:53:27,509 --> 00:53:29,071
When did you ever see this?

546
00:53:29,329 --> 00:53:36,891
Huh? No, it's just that it looks
familiar... Who gave this to you?

547
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:40,783
Manito. You know that game we used to play in

548
00:53:40,783 --> 00:53:43,736
6th grade where we would give
each other secret gifts?

549
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:46,870
Did we?

550
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:50,781
Yeah. I was really curious then.

551
00:53:51,716 --> 00:53:56,437
But, our homeroom teacher
transferred, so we never found out.

552
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:59,276
But it's praiseworthy.

553
00:53:59,352 --> 00:54:00,452
What is?

554
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:04,863
I'm talking about her.

555
00:54:05,753 --> 00:54:08,191
Are your parents well?

556
00:54:09,237 --> 00:54:12,841
They always took first place
at the town talent show.

557
00:54:15,696 --> 00:54:19,088
My mom and dad are a bit peculiar.

558
00:54:20,266 --> 00:54:22,930
Now that I think about it,
you've sure grown up a lot.

559
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:27,247
You used to be such a
crybaby in the old days.

560
00:54:27,247 --> 00:54:31,615
Hey! Who do you think made me cry?

561
00:54:31,798 --> 00:54:38,069
Who puts a dead mouse in someone's bag?
If I think about how freaked out I was...

562
00:54:38,909 --> 00:54:41,904
Hey, do you know how hard
it was for me to catch that rat?

563
00:54:42,424 --> 00:54:44,441
Then, you caught it on purpose?

564
00:54:45,221 --> 00:54:46,598
Why?

565
00:54:48,194 --> 00:54:53,212
No, it's just that there were
many mice in the neighborhood...

566
00:54:57,569 --> 00:55:02,755
You liked me then, didn't you?

567
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:04,887
That's why you'd pull such weird pranks.

568
00:55:05,097 --> 00:55:08,401
Hey, would I be crazy enough to like you?

569
00:55:09,343 --> 00:55:11,608
It would be more like the other way around.

570
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:17,042
If you confess now, I'll consider it.

571
00:55:19,165 --> 00:55:21,753
You sure do dream big!

572
00:55:21,904 --> 00:55:23,288
Same goes for you, too.

573
00:55:30,217 --> 00:55:33,533
[Prince Hours]

574
00:55:41,469 --> 00:55:44,804
- Thanks for listening to me.
- You're welcome.

575
00:55:44,845 --> 00:55:46,720
Bye.

576
00:55:50,429 --> 00:55:52,031
- About Prince Yi Hoo...

577
00:55:52,031 --> 00:55:54,441
- See you later.
- Goodbye, Your Highness.

578
00:55:54,441 --> 00:56:01,469
Has he ever attended school before?
He really needs to shape up.

579
00:56:01,469 --> 00:56:05,469
- He should at least try to learn.
- That's what I'm saying.

580
00:56:05,469 --> 00:56:08,469
He thinks the palace is his playground!

581
00:56:08,469 --> 00:56:12,469
He's always checking
himself out in the mirror.

582
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:16,887
He looks like an orangutan
with his thick lips.

583
00:56:16,887 --> 00:56:18,887
What a showoff.

584
00:56:18,929 --> 00:56:23,720
I can't believe I have to serve
a Chinese-noodle delivery boy.

585
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:32,469
I feel bad for the freshmen
who need to pay respect to him.

586
00:56:32,469 --> 00:56:35,845
You bastards! What did you just say?

587
00:56:35,845 --> 00:56:41,096
Don't insult Kang Hoo, you snobs!
Who do you think you are, huh?

588
00:56:41,096 --> 00:56:44,469
Just ignore them. Can't you
tell they're a bunch of losers?

589
00:56:44,469 --> 00:56:51,054
Do you know where this is? Don't act
low-class and get out of here!

590
00:56:51,054 --> 00:56:52,804
What? You jerk!

591
00:56:52,804 --> 00:56:55,720
Stop it.

592
00:57:00,469 --> 00:57:03,469
Stop it. They're my friends.

593
00:57:03,469 --> 00:57:08,469
Your Highness. Let me say something.

594
00:57:08,595 --> 00:57:13,720
You should pick better friends
for the dignity of the Imperial Court.

595
00:57:26,469 --> 00:57:30,012
Don't mind them. Let's get out of here.

596
00:57:30,012 --> 00:57:34,262
You got lucky this time!

597
00:57:44,469 --> 00:57:48,469
It's nice to see you guys again. Cheers!

598
00:57:48,469 --> 00:57:49,469
Cheers!

599
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:55,012
Wait! Let's sing "Clear Liquor."

600
00:57:55,137 --> 00:57:58,469
♪ Clear liquor, cheers, cheers, cheers!
A lovely sound, cheers, cheers, cheers! ♪

601
00:57:58,469 --> 00:58:00,804
♪ If you drink soju, bottoms up! ♪

602
00:58:00,804 --> 00:58:04,429
- Bottoms up!
- Bottoms up!

603
00:58:08,929 --> 00:58:13,304
That's how you drink soju.

604
00:58:13,304 --> 00:58:17,054
Drinking with you brings me
back to the good old days.

605
00:58:17,054 --> 00:58:23,012
Stop acting sad. It hasn't been that long.

606
00:58:23,054 --> 00:58:28,346
Did you just hit me? Want to fight?

607
00:58:28,346 --> 00:58:35,469
Forget it. I'll get thrown
in jail if I punch the Prince.

608
00:58:35,469 --> 00:58:41,720
You're right. I can't do anything I want now.

609
00:58:41,804 --> 00:58:43,137
Kang Hoo!

610
00:58:43,137 --> 00:58:45,012
Aren't you going to buy that bottle-cap cafe?

611
00:58:45,012 --> 00:58:47,054
You have money now.

612
00:58:47,054 --> 00:58:49,469
No.

613
00:58:49,469 --> 00:58:52,469
I'll buy it with my money,
not my father's money.

614
00:58:52,469 --> 00:58:58,512
- What if it's gone by then?
- Don't worry. I'll get it back.

615
00:58:58,512 --> 00:59:05,469
Everyone's so down. Let's drink.

616
00:59:05,469 --> 00:59:08,469
Let's drink beer now.

617
00:59:08,469 --> 00:59:14,887
- Where's the beer?
- Here it is!

618
00:59:14,929 --> 00:59:17,469
The aristocrats are so uncool.

619
00:59:17,469 --> 00:59:21,929
For our friendship that transcends status!

620
00:59:21,929 --> 00:59:24,469
Cheers!

621
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:52,637
Hello?

622
00:59:55,469 --> 00:59:59,512
Why does your voice sound like that?

623
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:02,804
Are you drunk?

624
01:00:11,469 --> 01:00:15,637
What are you doing here?

625
01:00:15,637 --> 01:00:18,469
Yang Sooneui!

626
01:00:18,469 --> 01:00:20,804
Hi, Yang Sooneui.

627
01:00:36,469 --> 01:00:39,762
Why did you get so drunk?

628
01:00:39,762 --> 01:00:44,595
Drunk? A little.

629
01:00:44,595 --> 01:00:46,720
Just a little.

630
01:00:49,887 --> 01:00:53,470
Get up.

631
01:00:53,637 --> 01:00:58,469
I want to stay here a little longer.

632
01:00:58,469 --> 01:01:02,804
I don't want to go back to the palace.

633
01:01:02,845 --> 01:01:07,262
I wanted to go to Incheon with my friends.

634
01:01:07,262 --> 01:01:09,470
I belong there.

635
01:01:11,679 --> 01:01:17,137
But, this is your home now.
You know that, too.

636
01:01:17,137 --> 01:01:19,429
You're right.

637
01:01:19,429 --> 01:01:22,637
My home... is the palace.

638
01:01:27,469 --> 01:01:29,469
Yang Sooneui.

639
01:01:29,469 --> 01:01:34,845
You don't think I'm fit to be
Crown Prince either, right?

640
01:01:34,845 --> 01:01:36,804
Right?

641
01:01:40,804 --> 01:01:42,595
I don't want to disappoint Her Majesty..

642
01:01:42,595 --> 01:01:51,469
the Empress Dowager,
and Uncle Hyosang, but...

643
01:02:01,469 --> 01:02:03,469
I don't know...

644
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:05,762
It's okay.

645
01:02:05,762 --> 01:02:08,971
I don't need it.

646
01:02:12,469 --> 01:02:15,469
Your hair's very long

647
01:03:03,932 --> 01:03:05,679
[Prince Hours]

648
01:03:07,157 --> 01:03:09,309
Are you mocking me again?

649
01:03:09,811 --> 01:03:11,924
A residential attendant is supposed

650
01:03:12,778 --> 01:03:14,085
to aid me in everything, right?

651
01:03:14,955 --> 01:03:17,283
How's Joon doing?

652
01:03:17,644 --> 01:03:21,952
As usual, he's getting along
well with Miss Saeryung.

653
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:26,668
Are you going to play?

654
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:28,285
Of course.

655
01:03:28,806 --> 01:03:31,134
I don't think you're ready
to play while on a horse.

656
01:03:31,134 --> 01:03:33,729
We'll see about that.

657
01:03:34,821 --> 01:03:37,322
A man and woman can't be friends.

658
01:03:37,437 --> 01:03:41,334
Your friend becomes "babe,"
then "dear," and then "Daddy."

659
01:03:41,334 --> 01:03:43,049
Don't you agree?

660
01:03:43,161 --> 01:03:48,322
We'll soon be in-laws.
I think we've been too formal until now.

661
01:03:48,322 --> 01:03:52,870
So, why don't we postpone the engagement?

662
01:03:56,437 --> 01:04:00,399
You became another man's school buddy
right before your engagement. How absurd.

663
01:04:00,399 --> 01:04:02,555
I don't think we're engaged yet.

664
01:04:02,858 --> 01:04:05,558
Show me some results if you want me.
