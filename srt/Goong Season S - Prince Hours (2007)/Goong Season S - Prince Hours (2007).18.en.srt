1
00:00:24,046 --> 00:00:28,169
The evaluation committee
has reached a decision.

2
00:00:28,169 --> 00:00:34,629
Prince Youngsung has won
the courage round.

3
00:00:34,671 --> 00:00:38,295
Your Majesty, I object.

4
00:00:38,337 --> 00:00:39,879
Speak.

5
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:42,629
We have yet to hold a special
Council meeting to determine

6
00:00:42,671 --> 00:00:46,253
whether he's qualified to
be a candidate or not.

7
00:00:46,295 --> 00:00:53,712
Determining who won when his qualifications
are still in doubt is difficult to accept.

8
00:00:58,337 --> 00:01:08,337
Prince Youngsung, by taking a great risk,
showed true Courage to bring truth to light.

9
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:15,004
I don't think you should
question his qualifications.

10
00:01:16,837 --> 00:01:20,712
I think we should put an end to
useless disputes.

11
00:01:22,212 --> 00:01:24,379
What does the Royal Kin think about this?

12
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:32,046
Well, we have to give him credit for
resolving this disgraceful matter

13
00:01:32,046 --> 00:01:37,712
and preserving the Imperial Court's safety.

14
00:01:40,295 --> 00:01:45,420
I agree as well.

15
00:01:45,462 --> 00:01:51,088
I don't have to bring up
the Imperial Law to discuss

16
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:53,295
how unsavory it is to
doubt his qualifications.

17
00:01:53,337 --> 00:01:55,337
Very well.

18
00:01:55,379 --> 00:02:01,671
Let's put an end to
the qualification controversy.

19
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:15,379
It's now time to announce
the last assignment.

20
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,462
Prince Youngsung won, and no one doubts
his qualifications anymore.

21
00:02:20,504 --> 00:02:25,545
Life is full of surprises.

22
00:02:25,587 --> 00:02:28,462
It's a tie now.

23
00:02:28,504 --> 00:02:36,504
The Virtue task... will be a killer round!

24
00:02:43,253 --> 00:02:45,169
The Canon of Reason
and Virtue teaches

25
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:53,169
that reason is what makes everything in
the world come alive.

26
00:02:53,295 --> 00:02:58,212
When reason accumulates,
virtue appears.

27
00:02:58,253 --> 00:03:06,253
To state it simply, virtue is being and
acting fair and understanding others.

28
00:03:12,712 --> 00:03:16,754
There are three scrolls.

29
00:03:16,754 --> 00:03:19,962
Written on the closed scroll is
a Chinese character

30
00:03:20,004 --> 00:03:27,170
which Her Majesty believes is the
most important virtue for a monarch.

31
00:03:27,212 --> 00:03:30,629
The two Princes can each write in one word

32
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:37,169
what you believe to be the most
important virtue for a monarch.

33
00:03:38,253 --> 00:03:43,337
That's your assignment for this round.

34
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:46,879
Whatever you write on the scroll will show

35
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:54,879
how prepared you are to
become a true monarch.

36
00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:01,295
We will see what each
Prince holds in his heart,

37
00:04:01,337 --> 00:04:06,169
and make a final decision
based on that.

38
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,629
We're very excited to
see Prince Youngsung's improvement.

39
00:04:19,212 --> 00:04:26,295
To be honest, I didn't expect him to
measure up to Prince Moonsung.

40
00:04:26,337 --> 00:04:32,921
What he did for the Courage
assignment really impressed me.

41
00:04:32,962 --> 00:04:40,962
I've since calmed down, but what happened
with Lady Yoo left me pondering.

42
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:46,671
I'm sure Grand Prince Hyojang is behind this.

43
00:04:47,712 --> 00:04:50,169
What do you think, Empress?

44
00:04:52,212 --> 00:04:55,253
I can't believe he did such a thing.

45
00:04:55,295 --> 00:05:00,420
That's how much be belittles
the Imperial Court.

46
00:05:00,462 --> 00:05:05,212
We need to have power.

47
00:05:05,253 --> 00:05:11,169
To do that, we need to create a
strong bond with the Prime Minister!

48
00:05:14,212 --> 00:05:16,545
A strong bond?

49
00:05:16,587 --> 00:05:19,796
Get Prince Youngsung
and Saeryung married, of course!

50
00:05:19,837 --> 00:05:22,379
How can he be so lucky?

51
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,879
Even the Royal Kin are supporting him.

52
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,462
I have to do something about this.

53
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:29,712
Like what?

54
00:05:29,712 --> 00:05:36,253
I need to strip the Empress
of both dignity and honor.

55
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,462
I'm sure there's a way...

56
00:05:55,046 --> 00:06:03,046
Why do you think my mother admitted
to the crime and left the palace?

57
00:06:03,587 --> 00:06:11,170
From my experiences in the palace
and what I found out about my mother,

58
00:06:13,837 --> 00:06:21,754
I've concluded that she had no choice.

59
00:06:24,462 --> 00:06:29,462
She sacrificed herself for my father.

60
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:41,212
Who could've tortured my parents like this?

61
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:49,337
Maybe it's Grand Prince Hyojang.

62
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:56,796
He was the only man involved
with the foundation at the time

63
00:06:56,837 --> 00:07:02,671
who had enough power to frame her.

64
00:07:06,671 --> 00:07:11,169
I can't let him do this to me.

65
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:13,337
We need to do something.

66
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:19,837
But, we don't have any evidence.

67
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:24,545
We might if we use our heads.

68
00:07:31,253 --> 00:07:36,337
What happened to the director's evidence?

69
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:37,712
Well...

70
00:07:37,712 --> 00:07:42,420
It's not in Prince Youngsung's hands, right?

71
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:47,379
The day before the director died,

72
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:52,169
he told Cho Sangki that he'd
hand over the evidence.

73
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:53,462
What?

74
00:07:53,504 --> 00:07:55,170
Does that mean it's in his hands?

75
00:07:55,212 --> 00:07:56,921
Maybe.

76
00:08:22,337 --> 00:08:25,295
So, what brings you here?

77
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:27,295
I have something to tell you

78
00:08:27,337 --> 00:08:31,295
regarding the embezzlement
scandal my mother was in.

79
00:08:31,337 --> 00:08:34,088
I'm sure you're aware

80
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:37,253
that the former director of the foundation
died in a car crash not too long ago.

81
00:08:37,295 --> 00:08:41,169
What about him?

82
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:46,169
He called me before he died.

83
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:48,504
He told me that my mother was framed

84
00:08:48,504 --> 00:08:53,671
and that he'd give me evidence to prove that.

85
00:08:56,921 --> 00:08:59,921
And?

86
00:08:59,962 --> 00:09:05,462
I have that evidence with me right now.

87
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:13,504
I thought I should talk to you
before I talk to Her Majesty.

88
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:18,169
After all, you were the chairman of
the board before the scandal took place,

89
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:23,212
and you were in charge of the
investigation for the scandal.

90
00:09:29,712 --> 00:09:31,754
What are you trying to say?

91
00:09:31,796 --> 00:09:38,504
I'm here to tell you that I think we'll
soon find who the real culprit is.

92
00:09:43,646 --> 00:09:46,702
[Prince Hours]

93
00:09:56,379 --> 00:10:01,295
It's been a long time since
I last laughed this hard.

94
00:10:01,337 --> 00:10:05,921
I feel so much better now.

95
00:10:10,253 --> 00:10:14,796
You're all here on your busy schedules.

96
00:10:14,837 --> 00:10:16,545
Why don't we settle the marriage proposal

97
00:10:16,587 --> 00:10:20,337
between Prince Youngsung and Miss Saeryung?

98
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:21,796
Mother.

99
00:10:21,837 --> 00:10:24,212
We don't even know how the Prince
and Miss Saeryung feel about this.

100
00:10:24,212 --> 00:10:26,921
Let's hear from them now then.

101
00:10:26,921 --> 00:10:29,420
We already know how Miss Saeryung feels.

102
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,420
All we need is Prince Youngsung's answer.

103
00:10:34,212 --> 00:10:37,046
Prince Youngsung!

104
00:10:37,088 --> 00:10:38,837
Yes, Your Highness.

105
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:44,170
I heard you and Miss Saeryung
are good friends.

106
00:10:44,212 --> 00:10:50,253
I don't think you can find a more
suitable wife than Miss Saeryung.

107
00:10:50,295 --> 00:10:53,253
What do you think?

108
00:11:03,212 --> 00:11:06,837
We shouldn't take our time
with marriage talks.

109
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,754
If the Prime Minister is okay
with it, I'd like to set a date.

110
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,253
Sure thing, Your Highness.

111
00:11:14,295 --> 00:11:17,169
Thank you.

112
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:20,962
Uh...

113
00:11:21,004 --> 00:11:23,587
I can't marry Miss Saeryung.

114
00:11:28,337 --> 00:11:32,088
What... What do you mean?

115
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:34,879
I'm sorry.

116
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:39,169
I already like someone else.

117
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:50,253
How dare he say such a
thing at a place like that?

118
00:11:50,295 --> 00:11:52,504
You shouldn't have done that.

119
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,170
You should've first checked
how Prince Youngsung feels.

120
00:11:55,212 --> 00:12:01,169
I only did that because I knew he'd say no.

121
00:12:01,169 --> 00:12:03,337
Like father, like son.

122
00:12:03,337 --> 00:12:07,046
He already likes someone else.

123
00:12:07,046 --> 00:12:08,921
She's out of the question.

124
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:12,337
I can't accept her.

125
00:12:12,337 --> 00:12:17,879
Do you know who she is?

126
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:22,212
I don't even want to talk about her.

127
00:12:22,253 --> 00:12:27,545
We don't need to make
the same mistake again.

128
00:12:29,671 --> 00:12:37,671
I remember the way you looked at me
when you first came into the palace.

129
00:12:54,253 --> 00:13:01,253
I want to believe you'll look
at me like that again someday.

130
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:10,629
Let's just stay friends.

131
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,629
That's very sad to hear.

132
00:13:20,671 --> 00:13:27,921
Miss Saeryung. Please stop.

133
00:13:27,962 --> 00:13:34,169
I don't deserve someone like you.

134
00:13:38,962 --> 00:13:41,295
I can't stop.

135
00:13:41,337 --> 00:13:43,796
I've just started.

136
00:13:48,004 --> 00:13:56,004
This is the first time I've opened
my heart and liked someone.

137
00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:58,337
How can I stop now?

138
00:14:24,212 --> 00:14:26,921
Where's Attendant Yang Sooneui?

139
00:14:28,962 --> 00:14:31,046
The Empress Dowager is looking for you.

140
00:14:31,088 --> 00:14:34,545
What's going on?

141
00:14:34,587 --> 00:14:38,169
Are you in love with Prince Youngsung?

142
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:42,129
You better not lie to me!

143
00:14:43,587 --> 00:14:46,046
Answer me!

144
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,629
Your Highness has guessed correctly.

145
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:58,587
What?

146
00:14:58,587 --> 00:15:01,587
Prince Youngsung and I
started seeing each other

147
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:05,170
after we found out how we
felt toward each other.

148
00:15:05,212 --> 00:15:06,504
You're merely a palace attendant!

149
00:15:06,545 --> 00:15:10,212
How can you feel that way
about your superior?

150
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,420
Stop crying...

151
00:15:32,462 --> 00:15:35,712
It's not over yet.

152
00:15:35,754 --> 00:15:39,420
I won't let it end like this.

153
00:15:46,754 --> 00:15:52,671
Fine, I'll trust that it's not because
of Prince Youngsung's status.

154
00:15:52,712 --> 00:16:00,712
But, I'm sure you've thought
this matter over as well.

155
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:06,169
Where do you think Prince Youngsung
and you will end up?

156
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:12,253
I hadn't thought about that yet.

157
00:16:12,295 --> 00:16:16,253
This is unbelievably frustrating.

158
00:16:16,295 --> 00:16:22,212
I only decided to be honest about
my feelings for as long as I can.

159
00:16:22,253 --> 00:16:30,253
Does that mean you'll willingly step away
if I won't tolerate your relationship?

160
00:16:35,088 --> 00:16:41,295
As you know, Prince Youngsung
is different from ordinary royalty.

161
00:16:41,337 --> 00:16:45,504
He was raised outside of the
palace by a commoner mother.

162
00:16:45,545 --> 00:16:54,170
He needs a prominent wife's help if he
wants to establish himself as a leader.

163
00:16:54,212 --> 00:17:00,379
There have been marriage talks.

164
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:06,169
You're attending the Royal Academy because
of the Empress's recommendation, right?

165
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:12,295
You seem like a smart person.

166
00:17:12,337 --> 00:17:16,169
If you're sincere about your feelings
towards Prince Youngsung,

167
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:24,169
you'll know what to do.

168
00:17:44,351 --> 00:17:48,775
It's about Attendant Yang whom you
requested as your study mate.

169
00:17:50,222 --> 00:17:55,713
Did you know she was in a serious
relationship with Prince Youngsung?

170
00:18:00,931 --> 00:18:03,104
Let me ask you one more thing.

171
00:18:03,104 --> 00:18:13,966
Did you request her to be your study mate
because you were interested in her, too?

172
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:20,432
Just what is wrong with you two?
Two princes fighting over a court lady?

173
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:39,640
Geez! Stop acting like you
can drink! Here, drink this.

174
00:18:45,648 --> 00:18:52,219
Okay, let's just pretend you're
drunk. Tell me. What's going on?

175
00:18:54,566 --> 00:19:03,225
Pretend? Fine... Hey, you! Your Highness!

176
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,500
You must be really drunk.

177
00:19:10,341 --> 00:19:15,892
You... What is it that you
like about me? Huh?

178
00:19:15,892 --> 00:19:21,617
What did I do that made you fall for me? Huh?

179
00:19:21,617 --> 00:19:23,372
What are you talking about?

180
00:19:26,257 --> 00:19:39,733
Like you said, I don't have a hot body.
I'm not as smart as I once used to be!

181
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:45,497
And! Though I don't have credit card debt,
I don't have any money saved up either.

182
00:19:45,497 --> 00:19:50,836
Right? So... why? Huh?

183
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,814
What about you? So why do you like me then?

184
00:19:56,656 --> 00:20:05,394
Me? Why do you need a reason to fall in love?

185
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:16,590
Why do you ask when you already
know the answer? Girls are so weird.

186
00:20:29,198 --> 00:20:40,673
You have to be brave. You have to be strong.
And don't be soft-hearted, okay?

187
00:20:44,574 --> 00:20:52,516
We've only made it halfway.
Or, maybe this is just a beginning.

188
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,664
She's drunk. Please put her to bed.

189
00:21:55,408 --> 00:21:57,512
Oh! Drunk?

190
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:14,955
Ugh! You smell like alcohol!
Girl, drink responsibly!

191
00:22:14,955 --> 00:22:16,374
- Ah, geez!
- Is she okay?

192
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:22,194
Please come in for a minute, Your Highness.

193
00:22:22,194 --> 00:22:24,882
No, it's too late. I should leave.

194
00:22:45,055 --> 00:22:46,350
Prince Moonsung!

195
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,165
Why did she get so drunk?

196
00:22:49,127 --> 00:22:53,603
I don't know. She really
wasn't herself tonight.

197
00:22:53,603 --> 00:22:58,098
Did you know the Empress
Dowager met with her today?

198
00:22:59,456 --> 00:23:06,911
If you can't protect her, then let her go!
You're only going to make her miserable!

199
00:23:06,911 --> 00:23:12,625
Is that why you requested her to be your
study buddy? You forced her to do it!

200
00:23:18,459 --> 00:23:25,934
I'll never give her up to you... because
I know you'll only make her unhappy!

201
00:23:25,934 --> 00:23:33,726
Same here! As someone who loves
her, I'm going to protect her!

202
00:24:00,725 --> 00:24:04,683
What are you doing here at this hour?

203
00:24:04,725 --> 00:24:09,308
I have something to tell you.

204
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:19,516
I want to make you the Emperor.
I came here to tell you that.

205
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:21,516
What do you mean?

206
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:26,100
I know what you want.

207
00:24:26,142 --> 00:24:34,142
You want to make me Emperor so you
hold the real power from behind.

208
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:43,725
I only wanted to become the Emperor
so I could run away from you.

209
00:24:43,766 --> 00:24:47,683
But, things are different now.

210
00:24:47,725 --> 00:24:51,599
There's a woman I want.

211
00:24:51,641 --> 00:24:54,267
I'll take the woman I want.

212
00:24:54,308 --> 00:25:00,683
In exchange, you can have
what you want as well.

213
00:25:00,725 --> 00:25:02,725
Do you need my help?

214
00:25:02,725 --> 00:25:06,766
I'm offering you a deal.

215
00:25:06,766 --> 00:25:14,434
I will join you in getting
rid of any obstacle

216
00:25:14,475 --> 00:25:18,683
that will hinder me from
becoming the Emperor...

217
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:26,434
whether it is Prince Youngsung
or the Imperial Court itself.

218
00:25:37,515 --> 00:25:39,515
Who is it?

219
00:25:53,766 --> 00:25:55,558
What are you doing here?

220
00:26:00,975 --> 00:26:04,808
I have a favor to ask.

221
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:12,350
Give me the evidence the director gave you.

222
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:15,392
I can't.

223
00:26:15,392 --> 00:26:18,515
That's useless now!

224
00:26:18,515 --> 00:26:21,515
The case is already statute-barred.

225
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:35,350
Please help me, for old time's sake.

226
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:40,683
Useless?

227
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:43,808
The Grand Duchess who was
sacrificed because of you

228
00:26:43,808 --> 00:26:48,058
never had a day of peace
for 20 years before her death.

229
00:26:48,058 --> 00:26:53,850
Even His Highness grew up
not knowing his true identity.

230
00:26:53,891 --> 00:26:57,267
It's all because of you two.

231
00:26:57,308 --> 00:27:05,558
For ruining the lives of those two, no,
all those involved... you'll pay the price.

232
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:12,641
Must you follow your
petty sense of justice

233
00:27:12,683 --> 00:27:18,558
at the expense of ruining a person
with whom you have a familial bond?

234
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:22,850
What are you talking about?

235
00:27:30,725 --> 00:27:34,058
Now is the time to reveal the truth.

236
00:27:39,017 --> 00:27:47,017
It's a little late, but there's
something you should know.

237
00:28:24,683 --> 00:28:26,475
This is The Palace.

238
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:32,599
What?

239
00:28:32,641 --> 00:28:36,558
You're... Director Doo-Hyun Choi's son?

240
00:29:15,641 --> 00:29:18,392
As an apology to the Grand Duchess,

241
00:29:18,434 --> 00:29:26,434
I will hand over the evidence
I kept just in case.

242
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:31,725
Listen! An Empress should love her people.

243
00:29:31,725 --> 00:29:35,516
I'm sure she wrote "love."

244
00:29:35,516 --> 00:29:38,680
That's what you would think. Ugh!

245
00:29:39,551 --> 00:29:41,065
Ah!

246
00:29:42,584 --> 00:29:45,227
Hoo, don't you have any guesses?

247
00:29:45,227 --> 00:29:48,558
Huh? Not yet.

248
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:56,599
I read a book about a monarch's virtues
and narrowed it down to about 30 words.

249
00:29:56,683 --> 00:29:58,683
Let's pick one.

250
00:30:03,641 --> 00:30:05,434
It's the last assignment.

251
00:30:05,434 --> 00:30:06,891
I doubt she'll make it that easy.

252
00:30:06,891 --> 00:30:10,515
The answer is probably
in Her Majesty's heart.

253
00:30:10,515 --> 00:30:12,225
Miss Saeryung!

254
00:30:17,641 --> 00:30:23,808
I looked into the things that happened
during Her Majesty's reign.

255
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,683
I'm sure Her Majesty picked something

256
00:30:25,725 --> 00:30:30,599
that touched her during
her life as an Empress.

257
00:30:30,641 --> 00:30:35,515
It'll help if you look back on her life.

258
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:57,515
I can't let you help me anymore.

259
00:30:57,515 --> 00:30:59,933
Don't worry about it.

260
00:30:59,975 --> 00:31:02,850
I'm only trying to help you
as your study buddy.

261
00:31:02,891 --> 00:31:08,058
I don't think you should be
my study buddy anymore.

262
00:31:15,516 --> 00:31:20,891
You still trust me as your friend,
right'?

263
00:31:20,933 --> 00:31:26,516
I don't think I should keep you by
my side when I know how you feel.

264
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:31,515
If you know how I feel,
please do me a favor.

265
00:31:35,515 --> 00:31:40,975
Let me help you until
the competition is over.

266
00:31:42,683 --> 00:31:45,641
You can do that for me, right?

267
00:31:52,434 --> 00:31:53,267
Miss Sooneui.

268
00:31:59,891 --> 00:32:02,641
Are you going to your Anthropology class?

269
00:32:02,683 --> 00:32:05,725
Let's walk together.

270
00:32:07,933 --> 00:32:11,183
I heard you spoke to the Empress Dowager.

271
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:16,725
How did you know?

272
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:22,515
I got in trouble for the same thing.

273
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:26,515
She was very concerned.

274
00:32:27,516 --> 00:32:28,599
Did you...

275
00:32:28,641 --> 00:32:34,933
If you're asking me if I told her
that I like you, the answer is no.

276
00:32:36,683 --> 00:32:39,058
I don't think it's time yet.

277
00:32:42,142 --> 00:32:46,183
I'm not that stupid.

278
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:53,850
I know what my role is in our relationship.

279
00:32:58,766 --> 00:33:04,515
What's your role in your relationship
with Prince Youngsung?

280
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:09,183
I will be with Prince Youngsung.

281
00:33:12,142 --> 00:33:17,350
A dream that can't be rooted
in reality is only a mirage.

282
00:33:20,434 --> 00:33:29,100
She saw what Prince Youngsung's father
went through after he married a commoner.

283
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:36,850
Do you know what it means that the
Empress Dowager knows how you two feel?

284
00:33:36,891 --> 00:33:41,975
She'll never approve of your
relationship with Prince Youngsung.

285
00:33:42,017 --> 00:33:43,350
Never.

286
00:33:46,641 --> 00:33:48,808
I'll get going.

287
00:33:58,697 --> 00:33:59,882
That's it for today.

288
00:34:00,642 --> 00:34:05,881
If you have any further questions,
please come to see me. Have a nice day.

289
00:34:10,726 --> 00:34:14,534
Yi Hoo and Yang Sooneui, would you please
have a moment with me before you leave?

290
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:35,089
It's not accepted yet,
but I submitted my resignation.

291
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:37,414
What?

292
00:34:37,414 --> 00:34:40,691
But, before I leave, I'd like
to invite you to dinner

293
00:34:40,691 --> 00:34:45,448
to show my appreciation for what you
have done for me at the district palace.

294
00:34:45,448 --> 00:34:49,515
Is it because of Her Majesty?

295
00:34:57,891 --> 00:35:01,725
They're finally going to break up.

296
00:35:03,933 --> 00:35:06,100
Do you think Her Majesty knows?

297
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:10,183
Probably.

298
00:35:11,641 --> 00:35:19,599
Her Majesty told me that she never forgot
about the Professor for the past 7 years.

299
00:35:19,641 --> 00:35:22,515
And now, they have to break up again.

300
00:35:25,308 --> 00:35:27,599
She has no choice.

301
00:35:27,641 --> 00:35:29,725
She's the Empress after all.

302
00:35:29,766 --> 00:35:35,475
I'm not too happy about Her Majesty
going out with the Professor either.

303
00:35:36,515 --> 00:35:39,515
I want her to date a Korean.

304
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:44,808
But, you can't control your feelings.

305
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:50,516
If they really love each other,
they shouldn't break up like that.

306
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:58,515
I think I can understand
why he wants to leave.

307
00:35:58,515 --> 00:35:59,808
It's being considerate of the other person.

308
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,515
How can you be considerate by leaving?

309
00:36:03,641 --> 00:36:07,267
You left me without
saying anything last time.

310
00:36:07,267 --> 00:36:10,225
Do you know how upset I was?

311
00:36:10,225 --> 00:36:13,100
I don't believe this.

312
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,475
Do you know how sad I was that time?

313
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:19,599
You refused to look me in the eye.

314
00:36:19,641 --> 00:36:23,225
You were so cold and mean!

315
00:36:23,267 --> 00:36:23,891
Do you know that?

316
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:27,683
You only hung out with Prince Moonsung!

317
00:36:27,725 --> 00:36:33,308
How do you think I felt whenever
I saw you two together?

318
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:38,850
Speaking of which, how long are
you going to be his study buddy?

319
00:36:38,891 --> 00:36:39,850
You should quit!

320
00:36:39,891 --> 00:36:43,392
I can't quit whenever I want to.

321
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,975
It was the Empress Dowager's order.

322
00:36:44,975 --> 00:36:49,515
Fine, I'll talk to the
Empress Dowager for you.

323
00:36:49,515 --> 00:36:51,725
No! Are you out of your mind?

324
00:36:51,766 --> 00:36:57,933
Do you like being with
Prince Moonsung or something?

325
00:36:59,725 --> 00:37:05,225
This is such a waste of time. Forget it.

326
00:37:05,267 --> 00:37:08,516
You know what? Forget it.

327
00:37:11,017 --> 00:37:13,017
I have to go home.

328
00:37:14,308 --> 00:37:15,850
Fine then.

329
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,599
Bye.

330
00:37:25,515 --> 00:37:32,515
"Smart love begins with loving yourself
more than anyone else in this world."

331
00:37:32,515 --> 00:37:37,766
That means you have to
make yourself beautiful.

332
00:37:37,808 --> 00:37:41,683
Can you help me out here?

333
00:37:41,725 --> 00:37:47,975
"A woman who loves herself
is of course loved by men."

334
00:37:57,183 --> 00:37:58,558
Your Highness!

335
00:37:59,641 --> 00:38:03,434
We just got new tiles on these floors.

336
00:38:03,475 --> 00:38:05,267
What?

337
00:38:05,308 --> 00:38:08,558
Ride softly.

338
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:14,725
Your Highness!

339
00:38:14,766 --> 00:38:15,766
What about dinner?

340
00:38:16,515 --> 00:38:19,515
Can't you clean during the day?

341
00:38:19,515 --> 00:38:21,350
What's the use of buying
expensive cosmetics

342
00:38:21,392 --> 00:38:25,641
if I'm going to get dust all over my face?

343
00:38:25,641 --> 00:38:28,100
Is that good for your skin?

344
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,142
Will that make me pretty?

345
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:31,100
Of course.

346
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:35,683
This will make your skin
moist and healthy.

347
00:38:35,725 --> 00:38:38,683
Beauty is a woman's weapon.

348
00:38:38,725 --> 00:38:41,516
You can get away with
anything if you're pretty.

349
00:38:42,725 --> 00:38:46,434
It's sad, but true.

350
00:38:48,475 --> 00:38:50,225
Let me try some.

351
00:38:50,267 --> 00:38:51,891
I want to be pretty, too.

352
00:38:57,641 --> 00:38:58,808
I wonder who that is.

353
00:38:58,808 --> 00:39:00,515
Who is it?

354
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:13,142
What are you doing here?

355
00:39:13,183 --> 00:39:15,515
Is Yang Sooneui inside?

356
00:39:32,017 --> 00:39:34,850
What's this picture about?

357
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:37,683
Can't you tell?

358
00:39:37,725 --> 00:39:41,808
It's the Empress and Professor
Alexander's secret rendezvous in Africa.

359
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:45,515
Are they lovers?

360
00:39:46,683 --> 00:39:48,683
Why do you have this picture?

361
00:39:48,725 --> 00:39:54,350
I'm going to send that picture to
the Empress Dowager tomorrow.

362
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,058
The Empress Dowager
and the Empress will think

363
00:39:56,100 --> 00:40:00,558
that it's from Grand Prince Hyojang.

364
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:01,933
I don't understand why you'd do that.

365
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:05,766
Why don't you take a guess?

366
00:40:09,308 --> 00:40:11,516
You want to coerce Her Majesty
and ruin her relationship

367
00:40:11,558 --> 00:40:18,558
with Grand Prince Hyojang,
so you can reap the benefits?

368
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:19,683
Yes.

369
00:40:19,725 --> 00:40:21,766
Aren't you going too far?

370
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,683
I'm doing this for you.

371
00:40:26,725 --> 00:40:28,515
The more threatened the Imperial Court feels,

372
00:40:28,515 --> 00:40:33,515
they more anxiously they'll want you
and Prince Youngsung to get married.

373
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:46,725
Wow! This looks good.

374
00:40:46,766 --> 00:40:48,515
Kimchi.

375
00:40:50,308 --> 00:40:51,933
Thank you!

376
00:41:03,641 --> 00:41:04,725
What a sight.

377
00:41:06,515 --> 00:41:08,183
You have all the delicacies
you can ask for in the palace,

378
00:41:08,183 --> 00:41:11,558
yet you want this ramen.

379
00:41:11,558 --> 00:41:13,891
This is so good.

380
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:20,599
I wonder why Yongnam went
jogging all of a sudden.

381
00:41:20,641 --> 00:41:21,766
Leave her alone.

382
00:41:21,808 --> 00:41:25,558
She needs to lose weight.

383
00:41:26,308 --> 00:41:28,599
What's wrong with Yongnam?

384
00:41:28,641 --> 00:41:32,267
Do you check out the attendants' bodies?

385
00:41:33,516 --> 00:41:38,516
No, it's just basic instinct.

386
00:41:38,558 --> 00:41:40,725
It's all about instincts.

387
00:41:44,683 --> 00:41:47,017
Stop eating.

388
00:41:47,017 --> 00:41:49,516
I was eating that! That's so dirty!

389
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,641
Wow, this reminds me of the old days.

390
00:41:55,683 --> 00:41:57,683
Do your parents ever talk about me?

391
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:07,975
What's this book about?

392
00:42:08,017 --> 00:42:11,515
"What Men Really Think"?

393
00:42:11,515 --> 00:42:12,766
You even underlined it.

394
00:42:12,808 --> 00:42:16,475
"The 6-Step Strategy for
Nabbing the Best Boyfriend."

395
00:42:18,017 --> 00:42:21,058
You actually study this stuff?

396
00:42:21,058 --> 00:42:23,515
I didn't buy this book.

397
00:42:35,515 --> 00:42:37,558
I'm sorry.

398
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,975
I was wrong.

399
00:42:40,017 --> 00:42:41,599
Forgive me.

400
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:55,766
All this for ramen?

401
00:42:55,766 --> 00:42:58,850
What a loser.

402
00:43:01,641 --> 00:43:06,599
Did you talk to Her Majesty today?

403
00:43:06,641 --> 00:43:08,142
No.

404
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,599
What if she doesn't know?

405
00:43:14,641 --> 00:43:16,515
I'm worried.

406
00:43:19,515 --> 00:43:25,017
If he has to leave, shouldn't she
see him before he's gone?

407
00:43:47,058 --> 00:43:48,515
Your Highness.

408
00:44:15,515 --> 00:44:17,599
Alex resigned?

409
00:44:19,683 --> 00:44:23,515
Is that true?

410
00:44:26,142 --> 00:44:29,267
Yes, Your Majesty.

411
00:44:31,516 --> 00:44:34,850
Why... why did Alex...

412
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:37,515
The Empress Dowager is here.

413
00:44:40,515 --> 00:44:42,683
Mother, what brings you here?

414
00:44:42,725 --> 00:44:47,558
Empress, what happened?

415
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,515
What?

416
00:44:49,515 --> 00:44:55,100
I'm asking you about that picture.

417
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:05,392
He resigned?

418
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:11,641
Maybe he was shocked by
what happened last time.

419
00:45:11,683 --> 00:45:15,515
That means we can't corner the Empress.

420
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:19,516
Forgive me, my lord.

421
00:45:19,558 --> 00:45:25,515
If he really is leaving,
she'll see him one last time.

422
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:29,516
This is our last chance.

423
00:45:29,558 --> 00:45:31,683
I understand, my lord.

424
00:45:31,725 --> 00:45:34,267
Grand Prince...

425
00:45:34,267 --> 00:45:41,183
shouldn't we be more worried about
the evidence Prince Youngsung has?

426
00:45:43,641 --> 00:45:47,850
He might be bluffing.

427
00:45:47,891 --> 00:45:52,515
If he really does have the evidence,

428
00:45:52,515 --> 00:45:58,808
he couldn't have visited the man
who did that to his own mother.

429
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:01,599
Yes, but...

430
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:10,691
[Prince Hours]

431
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:31,558
People might see us.
You don't have to greet me.

432
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:34,058
What did you want to talk to me about?

433
00:46:45,475 --> 00:46:46,599
What's this?

434
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:54,599
Something very important to Your Highness,
your parents, and Prince Youngsung.

435
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:52,142
Why are you...

436
00:47:52,142 --> 00:47:55,516
People might hear us.

437
00:47:55,516 --> 00:47:57,350
Please lower your voice.

438
00:48:00,558 --> 00:48:03,017
How did you get these?

439
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:08,058
Why are you giving these to me?

440
00:48:09,558 --> 00:48:11,975
What were you thinking?

441
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:18,350
You're the only one
who can resolve the conflict

442
00:48:18,392 --> 00:48:21,641
concerning the embezzlement scandal.

443
00:48:21,641 --> 00:48:29,183
This matter also concerns your parents.

444
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:33,516
You know what I'm going to do with these.

445
00:48:33,558 --> 00:48:40,516
Prince Youngsung only wants
to restore his mother's honor.

446
00:48:40,558 --> 00:48:42,891
He doesn't want to punish anyone.

447
00:48:45,225 --> 00:48:51,683
The deeds of the parents are now
being passed onto the children.

448
00:48:51,725 --> 00:48:59,516
You're the only one who can persuade
your parents and resolve this karma.

449
00:49:21,891 --> 00:49:23,515
Wait!

450
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:28,599
Use your sound judgment.

451
00:50:01,267 --> 00:50:04,515
You have something to tell me?

452
00:50:04,515 --> 00:50:07,142
Where's Mother?

453
00:50:07,142 --> 00:50:11,142
Does she need to hear this too?

454
00:50:11,183 --> 00:50:17,891
Actually, I prefer this because I know
my mother will never tell me the truth.

455
00:50:19,515 --> 00:50:20,975
The truth?

456
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,515
Do you know who Cho Sangki is?

457
00:50:28,434 --> 00:50:31,516
How do you know him?

458
00:50:31,558 --> 00:50:35,516
Though Prince Youngsung?

459
00:50:35,516 --> 00:50:37,475
He visited me yesterday.

460
00:50:39,641 --> 00:50:43,516
He told me something very
disturbing about you two.

461
00:50:45,558 --> 00:50:53,475
I thought about turning
a blind eye, but I couldn't.

462
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:00,599
I don't have anything to tell you.

463
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:01,515
Go back.

464
00:51:01,515 --> 00:51:02,392
Father!

465
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,058
Go back!

466
00:51:07,183 --> 00:51:09,308
Why you little...

467
00:51:12,558 --> 00:51:18,058
Tell me, please...

468
00:51:20,515 --> 00:51:24,350
Are you really...

469
00:51:24,392 --> 00:51:25,975
Shut up!

470
00:51:27,308 --> 00:51:28,142
Shut up!

471
00:51:28,183 --> 00:51:29,683
Shut up!

472
00:51:31,308 --> 00:51:36,515
Regardless of what Sangki told you,
and regardless of what you think,

473
00:51:36,515 --> 00:51:38,515
you're my son.

474
00:51:38,515 --> 00:51:41,891
I've always thought of you as my son!

475
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:46,683
Do you know why?

476
00:51:46,683 --> 00:51:52,267
You have to be my son until the day you die!

477
00:51:52,308 --> 00:51:55,683
Because you have to be the Emperor!

478
00:52:33,142 --> 00:52:34,808
Young Master...

479
00:52:53,515 --> 00:52:58,515
Regardless of what Sangki told you,
and regardless of what you think,

480
00:52:58,515 --> 00:53:00,766
you're my son.

481
00:53:00,808 --> 00:53:04,558
I've always thought of you as my son!

482
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:09,515
Do you know why?

483
00:53:09,515 --> 00:53:14,392
You have to be my son
until the day you die!

484
00:53:15,308 --> 00:53:18,475
Because you have to be the Emperor!

485
00:53:20,515 --> 00:53:24,142
Please, for old time's sake.

486
00:53:25,515 --> 00:53:27,392
Please, Sangki.

487
00:53:34,725 --> 00:53:41,225
The deeds of the parents are now
being passed onto the children.

488
00:53:41,267 --> 00:53:48,599
You're the only one who can persuade
your parents and absolve past sins.

489
00:53:48,641 --> 00:53:50,100
Do you know why?

490
00:53:50,142 --> 00:53:55,558
You have to be my son
until the day you die!

491
00:54:55,515 --> 00:54:59,058
Prince Youngsung is here.

492
00:55:06,641 --> 00:55:11,350
Your Majesty, I have something
important to tell you.

493
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:15,100
Can I have dinner with you?

494
00:55:32,683 --> 00:55:34,308
Professor.

495
00:56:28,599 --> 00:56:31,515
Did you find Joon yet?

496
00:56:31,515 --> 00:56:34,308
Where is he?

497
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:38,434
My lord, the Empress is outside.

498
00:56:41,558 --> 00:56:43,183
Really?

499
00:56:43,183 --> 00:56:49,515
She's having a secret rendezvous
with the Professor at a restaurant.

500
00:56:49,515 --> 00:56:51,183
I knew it!

501
00:56:51,225 --> 00:56:53,392
She had to see him one last time.

502
00:56:53,434 --> 00:56:55,683
The press is probably there by now.

503
00:56:56,641 --> 00:56:58,766
Good.

504
00:56:58,808 --> 00:57:04,225
They're probably rushing like
a bunch of hungry piranhas.

505
00:57:11,641 --> 00:57:16,434
I wonder what they're talking about.

506
00:57:16,434 --> 00:57:21,308
Her Majesty is probably going
to persuade him not to go.

507
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:31,850
I think the Professor is persuading
Her Majesty just to let him go.

508
00:57:33,641 --> 00:57:35,766
Are you still not over that yet?

509
00:57:35,808 --> 00:57:38,225
Why would anyone want to
break up when they're in love?

510
00:57:39,515 --> 00:57:40,933
You're dumb.

511
00:57:40,975 --> 00:57:42,683
They're breaking up because they're in love.

512
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:47,683
If you're in love, you should stand
by that person until the end.

513
00:57:47,725 --> 00:57:51,515
Leaving the person you love
because you're in love is stupid!

514
00:57:51,515 --> 00:57:53,515
Why are you so mad?

515
00:57:56,183 --> 00:57:59,515
This reminds me of my mother.

516
00:57:59,515 --> 00:58:05,308
I heard my father missed my mother for the
rest of his life after they were separated.

517
00:58:06,017 --> 00:58:08,558
My mother did the same.

518
00:58:08,599 --> 00:58:10,725
That's wrong.

519
00:58:26,558 --> 00:58:32,515
Promise me you won't leave me first.

520
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:19,975
I won't regret it.

521
00:59:25,142 --> 00:59:33,142
I won't regret loving you, or missing you.

522
00:59:35,641 --> 00:59:43,641
It was short, but I was
happy while it lasted.

523
00:59:48,641 --> 00:59:55,515
I'll cherish these moments with
you for the rest of my life.

524
00:59:59,933 --> 01:00:03,058
I won't tell you that I'm sorry.

525
01:00:05,641 --> 01:00:13,641
Because I loved you in the best way I can.

526
01:00:19,641 --> 01:00:25,933
And, I still will.

527
01:00:29,558 --> 01:00:35,017
This is the last day I'm going to cry.

528
01:00:35,017 --> 01:00:41,891
I won't cry anymore.

529
01:00:43,725 --> 01:00:51,725
Because I'm the Empress of this country.

530
01:00:55,641 --> 01:01:03,641
I will be resolute and strong.

531
01:01:06,641 --> 01:01:13,599
So, don't worry about me.

532
01:01:38,515 --> 01:01:41,475
Promise me!

533
01:01:41,475 --> 01:01:42,683
I can't.

534
01:01:42,683 --> 01:01:43,725
What?

535
01:01:43,725 --> 01:01:46,891
Why not?

536
01:01:46,891 --> 01:01:48,683
You never know what
will happen in the future.

537
01:01:48,683 --> 01:01:50,350
In life...

538
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:52,392
In life what?

539
01:01:54,808 --> 01:02:02,515
Something you can't do
anything about can happen.

540
01:02:02,515 --> 01:02:09,515
Like what happened to your
mother and the Professor...

541
01:02:09,515 --> 01:02:17,392
Maybe I have to leave because I'm in love.

542
01:02:21,142 --> 01:02:23,515
So...

543
01:02:23,515 --> 01:02:28,933
Are you saying you'll leave if that happens?

544
01:02:33,515 --> 01:02:38,558
Yang Sooneui, don't.

545
01:02:38,599 --> 01:02:44,641
If you leave me again,
I won't be able to take it.

546
01:02:52,891 --> 01:03:00,516
So, promise me you'll be by
my side for the rest of my life.

547
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:15,599
What's that?

548
01:03:49,683 --> 01:03:51,350
What's going on between you two?

549
01:03:51,392 --> 01:03:52,725
Your Majesty! Say something!

550
01:03:52,766 --> 01:03:56,100
Which country is he from?

551
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:59,725
What do you think the people will
say about this relationship?

552
01:03:59,725 --> 01:04:03,142
- Please say something!
- Please say something!

553
01:04:39,176 --> 01:04:40,894
[Prince Hours]
