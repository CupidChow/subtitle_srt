1
00:00:07,015 --> 00:00:10,308
That's the truck?

2
00:00:10,308 --> 00:00:12,015
Yes.

3
00:00:12,015 --> 00:00:15,225
It's going to make me look really uncool!

4
00:01:36,934 --> 00:01:39,099
Excuse me, your backlight is out.

5
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,015
Which one?

6
00:01:41,015 --> 00:01:42,892
The left one.

7
00:01:42,892 --> 00:01:45,266
Something happen?

8
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:47,600
But I just replaced them.

9
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,015
Anyway... drive safely.

10
00:01:51,015 --> 00:01:52,683
Thank you.

11
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:42,767
This is so not cool.

12
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:45,433
My heart is racing.

13
00:02:55,015 --> 00:02:58,558
The Royal Council meeting is tomorrow?

14
00:02:58,558 --> 00:03:08,015
Prince Hyosung petitioned for it,
and the Prime Minister approved.

15
00:03:08,015 --> 00:03:16,558
If we don't get enough votes,
it'll be a waste of time.

16
00:03:16,558 --> 00:03:22,015
All 8 members except

17
00:03:22,015 --> 00:03:25,266
for the Speaker of the House
and the Chief Justice will attend.

18
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:28,015
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

19
00:03:28,015 --> 00:03:36,433
The Royal Kin and the Lower House
members are with Grand Prince Hyojang.

20
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:40,725
Only Prince Hyosung, the Prime Minister,

21
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:44,475
and the Director of Palace
will welcome Prince Hoo.

22
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:47,016
Yes, Your Majesty.

23
00:03:47,016 --> 00:03:49,642
What about the Deputy Prime Minister?

24
00:03:49,642 --> 00:03:54,015
He has many ties with the Royal
Council and the lower house.

25
00:03:54,015 --> 00:04:00,183
I don't know if the Deputy Prime
Minister will vote in favor.

26
00:04:04,015 --> 00:04:12,015
I'll need at least 6 votes then.

27
00:04:12,015 --> 00:04:14,015
That'll be hard.

28
00:04:14,015 --> 00:04:15,475
Your Majesty.

29
00:04:15,475 --> 00:04:21,015
The Royal Council approved
of Prince Hyoin's wedding.

30
00:04:21,015 --> 00:04:26,558
That marriage was never revoked.

31
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:34,015
Why would they disapprove of His Highness
Emperor Hunchin's descendant?

32
00:04:34,015 --> 00:04:36,225
It's Prince Hyojang!

33
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,010
As the head of the Upper House,

34
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,808
he has control over the ruling
party and the Royal Kin!

35
00:04:41,808 --> 00:04:49,975
He thinks nothing of me, and this
concerns Prince Moonsung's future!

36
00:04:49,975 --> 00:04:54,642
I can't even register a direct royal
descendant without their approval.

37
00:04:54,642 --> 00:05:00,015
What would my father say if he saw this?

38
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:08,015
I feel like a caged bird.

39
00:05:44,808 --> 00:05:47,725
Who is that stunning lady?

40
00:05:51,141 --> 00:05:54,015
Welcome, Mother.

41
00:05:57,225 --> 00:06:01,015
Like mother, like daughter.

42
00:06:01,015 --> 00:06:06,183
You're more beautiful than
most actresses out there.

43
00:06:06,183 --> 00:06:12,099
No wonder many men want
to be your palace attendant.

44
00:06:23,642 --> 00:06:31,015
This ballet performance was put
together by Professor Huh's son.

45
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:34,975
Mother, how many times do I have to tell you?

46
00:06:34,975 --> 00:06:37,058
I don't want to get married.

47
00:06:37,058 --> 00:06:43,015
Let nature take its course!

48
00:06:43,015 --> 00:06:46,015
You're a woman, too.

49
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:51,141
Why would you want to live by yourself?

50
00:06:53,015 --> 00:06:56,433
It's been seven years
since you took the throne.

51
00:06:56,433 --> 00:07:02,015
I don't know how I'll face
the late Emperor when I die.

52
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:13,015
Don't you know how I feel?

53
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:15,433
Of course I do, Mother.

54
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:16,015
But...

55
00:07:16,015 --> 00:07:19,015
That's enough.

56
00:07:19,015 --> 00:07:23,350
I'll tell them that you're coming.

57
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,015
Bye.

58
00:07:25,015 --> 00:07:27,725
Mother!

59
00:07:27,725 --> 00:07:29,099
Mother!

60
00:07:57,015 --> 00:08:00,934
I can't believe you're
keeping a secret from me!

61
00:08:00,934 --> 00:08:06,015
Remember how we met at that
huge Court Lady Exam?

62
00:08:06,015 --> 00:08:11,015
We were in the same group,
and ended up becoming roommates!

63
00:08:11,015 --> 00:08:14,517
How can you do this to me?

64
00:08:14,517 --> 00:08:17,015
I'm disappointed.

65
00:08:18,225 --> 00:08:22,016
But, you're a blabbermouth.

66
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,683
I'm going to turn this into a pin cushion!

67
00:08:28,683 --> 00:08:31,015
No!

68
00:08:31,015 --> 00:08:35,558
You'll have insomnia until the day you die.

69
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:39,015
I'll talk! I'll talk!

70
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:48,015
You're crazy!

71
00:08:48,015 --> 00:08:49,015
He just stepped outside.

72
00:08:49,015 --> 00:08:53,015
No, he ran away!

73
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:56,975
If they find out, you'll never get promoted.

74
00:08:56,975 --> 00:09:00,015
You'll forever be a trainee.

75
00:09:00,015 --> 00:09:00,642
No way...

76
00:09:00,642 --> 00:09:03,828
Didn't you hear what
happened to that one girl?

77
00:09:03,828 --> 00:09:07,015
She set a chicken that was in
the Senate free out of pity...

78
00:09:07,015 --> 00:09:11,015
and ended up being a trainee
until she was thirty!

79
00:09:11,015 --> 00:09:12,934
He said he'll be back soon.

80
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:14,015
And, you believed him?

81
00:09:14,015 --> 00:09:16,600
He ran away in the middle of the night!

82
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,517
We can't sit back. Tomorrow's your day off.

83
00:09:21,517 --> 00:09:24,099
Find him and bring him back.

84
00:09:24,099 --> 00:09:26,015
What?

85
00:09:29,015 --> 00:09:31,358
Kang Hoo, where the heck were you?

86
00:09:32,055 --> 00:09:33,970
There are so many palaces. I asked
Mr. Cho and he wouldn't tell me.

87
00:09:35,015 --> 00:09:38,015
What about those guys?

88
00:09:38,015 --> 00:09:40,015
Where were you?

89
00:09:40,015 --> 00:09:42,683
You idiots!

90
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:45,141
I told you I was in the
palace with the Empress!

91
00:09:45,141 --> 00:09:48,850
Were you in the hospital by chance?

92
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:54,767
Anyway, I'm going to have a duel with Bulbam.

93
00:09:54,767 --> 00:09:57,015
A duel with Bulbam? No way!

94
00:09:57,015 --> 00:10:00,141
Bulbam may be short,
but he's a tough fighter!

95
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,767
You won't stand a chance!

96
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:08,350
You know me, the legendary 17 against 1!

97
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:13,183
He's in a rage right now! He's
not Bulbam. He's "Bul-bomb!"

98
00:10:13,183 --> 00:10:14,808
I'll go with you.

99
00:10:14,808 --> 00:10:18,683
Hey, it's supposed to be a duel!

100
00:10:18,683 --> 00:10:21,015
A man's got to keep his cool.

101
00:10:21,015 --> 00:10:24,016
It's that girl.

102
00:10:24,016 --> 00:10:26,015
Don't answer that!

103
00:10:26,015 --> 00:10:27,767
Who is she?

104
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:30,015
Miss Forgetful.

105
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,015
I'm off.

106
00:10:34,015 --> 00:10:35,015
Don't follow me.

107
00:10:35,015 --> 00:10:36,808
Okay.

108
00:10:39,058 --> 00:10:40,808
Aren't you going to follow me?

109
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:42,015
You told us not to.

110
00:10:42,015 --> 00:10:44,015
Come with me.

111
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,331
- You!
- Yeah!

112
00:11:00,015 --> 00:11:03,015
Yo, Bulbam.

113
00:11:03,015 --> 00:11:06,015
How've you been?

114
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:09,015
Are you a nice guy now?

115
00:11:09,015 --> 00:11:14,015
You got my bike back from the shop.

116
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:17,015
If you even laid a finger on it, you're dead.

117
00:11:17,015 --> 00:11:21,975
Don't even think about
pulling something funny.

118
00:11:21,975 --> 00:11:24,183
Aren't you cold?

119
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:28,015
Be quiet, man...

120
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,016
Take it easy, man.

121
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,015
I'm going to crush you!

122
00:11:51,015 --> 00:11:52,015
No!

123
00:11:52,015 --> 00:11:54,015
Bulbam! Calm down.

124
00:11:54,015 --> 00:11:56,015
I still have payments left on that bike.

125
00:11:56,015 --> 00:12:00,266
You have no idea how mad I am!

126
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:02,015
No!

127
00:12:02,015 --> 00:12:04,015
- Let me ask you one thing.
- What?

128
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:07,225
Are you sure you fought 17 against 1?

129
00:12:07,225 --> 00:12:09,015
Weren't you one of the 17?

130
00:12:09,015 --> 00:12:10,975
Of course I was the 1!

131
00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:12,058
Whatever!

132
00:12:12,058 --> 00:12:14,015
I asked someone about this, you jerk!

133
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:18,517
What? Don't talk crap about my legend!

134
00:12:18,517 --> 00:12:20,015
Tell me the truth!

135
00:12:20,015 --> 00:12:22,015
You're right!

136
00:12:22,015 --> 00:12:23,642
I was one of the 17!

137
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:27,015
I was sent to the ER because he
beat the crap out of me. Satisfied?

138
00:12:27,015 --> 00:12:30,266
Really? I'm sorry then.

139
00:12:32,015 --> 00:12:34,015
Hit me instead!

140
00:12:34,015 --> 00:12:36,266
I'll take it.

141
00:12:36,266 --> 00:12:38,015
Something smells fishy.

142
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,015
He's holding something.

143
00:12:40,015 --> 00:12:43,266
Is that a knife?

144
00:12:44,934 --> 00:12:46,015
Kang Hoo!

145
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:50,642
You're about to lose your teeth!

146
00:12:50,642 --> 00:12:53,015
Wait, Bulbam!

147
00:12:53,015 --> 00:12:55,934
You should know something before you hit me.

148
00:12:55,934 --> 00:12:57,015
Why, you!

149
00:12:57,015 --> 00:13:01,558
I'm actually a very important person.

150
00:13:01,558 --> 00:13:03,141
Whatever!

151
00:13:03,141 --> 00:13:07,016
I'm going to be the next Emperor!

152
00:13:07,016 --> 00:13:09,934
- Whatever!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

153
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,015
- Let go!
- Let go!

154
00:13:15,015 --> 00:13:18,015
Come over here!

155
00:13:18,015 --> 00:13:21,015
What did you say?

156
00:13:21,015 --> 00:13:24,266
Come over here!

157
00:13:30,015 --> 00:13:32,475
Police are coming!

158
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:40,720
Wait up!

159
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,558
Bulbam! See you later!

160
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:13,088
Bulbam! Hop on!

161
00:14:24,143 --> 00:14:27,808
A one, a two, a one-two-three-four!

162
00:14:27,808 --> 00:14:30,286
♪ Feels so hot, feels so hot hot ♪

163
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,136
♪ The soju bottle I'm holding in my hand ♪

164
00:14:33,136 --> 00:14:38,052
♪ Feels so hot, feels so hot hot ♪

165
00:14:38,052 --> 00:14:40,514
Woooo!

166
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,357
- Get up, man.
- Get up!

167
00:14:44,357 --> 00:14:46,436
- I can't!
- Get up!

168
00:14:46,436 --> 00:14:48,015
But, I can't sing.

169
00:14:48,015 --> 00:14:52,475
A toast of love between the two bosses.

170
00:14:55,866 --> 00:14:57,364
Lift up your glasses.

171
00:14:59,015 --> 00:15:00,183
This is so embarrassing...

172
00:15:04,266 --> 00:15:06,600
Applause!

173
00:15:08,683 --> 00:15:12,350
Sit down.

174
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:17,350
Let's drink ourselves silly tonight!

175
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:21,558
Does this mean Bulbam's group
and Kang Hoo's group are together now?

176
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:27,558
Kang Hoo, let's take over the
other areas while we're at it!

177
00:15:27,558 --> 00:15:29,266
Leave me out of it.

178
00:15:29,308 --> 00:15:30,433
Why?

179
00:15:30,433 --> 00:15:33,642
I have to go to the palace.

180
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:36,266
Gosh, I don't want to go.

181
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:38,808
This is more my style.

182
00:15:38,808 --> 00:15:40,015
Here we go again!

183
00:15:40,015 --> 00:15:43,266
You and that nonsense crap
about being the next Emperor!

184
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:44,808
I'm serious!

185
00:15:44,808 --> 00:15:50,391
Want me to tell you again? I'm a prince,
and my grandfather is Emperor Hunchin!

186
00:15:50,391 --> 00:15:53,197
I've been in the palace
for the last two days!

187
00:15:53,197 --> 00:15:57,654
- Whatever!
- You're sick in the head!

188
00:15:57,808 --> 00:16:00,517
I'm dead serious!

189
00:16:00,517 --> 00:16:05,015
I can't sleep or wear whatever I want!

190
00:16:05,015 --> 00:16:08,015
I can't even hold my
chopsticks the way I want!

191
00:16:08,015 --> 00:16:09,896
This is driving me crazy...

192
00:16:09,896 --> 00:16:15,099
- You're crazy!
- Shut up!

193
00:16:16,015 --> 00:16:18,683
Stop it.

194
00:16:18,683 --> 00:16:21,475
I'll just consider this as
your way of saying farewell.

195
00:16:21,475 --> 00:16:26,015
You better manage my piers well.

196
00:16:26,015 --> 00:16:30,015
And take care of Mr. Cho, too.

197
00:16:30,015 --> 00:16:35,015
Aren't you going back to The Palace?

198
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:38,015
Not that Palace. The other palace!

199
00:16:39,683 --> 00:16:41,015
Your Highness!

200
00:16:44,015 --> 00:16:46,015
Your Highness!

201
00:16:48,015 --> 00:16:49,850
Your Highness!

202
00:17:02,015 --> 00:17:06,058
Yang Sooneui, you're in trouble.

203
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,934
Okay.

204
00:17:54,015 --> 00:17:55,433
Hello?

205
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:58,850
Is Kang Hoo with you?

206
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,892
Kang Hoo?

207
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,475
Yes.

208
00:18:04,475 --> 00:18:07,015
Where are you?

209
00:18:07,015 --> 00:18:11,015
In the restaurant. Where else?

210
00:18:11,015 --> 00:18:13,015
The restaurant?

211
00:18:13,015 --> 00:18:15,015
What's that?

212
00:18:15,015 --> 00:18:19,015
It's Tae Wang!

213
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:22,015
Tae Wang? Where's that?

214
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:28,015
In Incheon, Chinatown! The best Chinese
restaurant! You don't even know Tae Wang?

215
00:18:31,266 --> 00:18:33,433
Hello?

216
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:35,475
Hey!

217
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:36,530
Hey!

218
00:18:42,975 --> 00:18:46,015
How did the Prince leave the palace?

219
00:18:46,015 --> 00:18:48,683
What were the Royal Guards doing?

220
00:18:48,683 --> 00:18:51,015
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

221
00:18:51,015 --> 00:18:53,266
It happened all too sudden.

222
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:56,642
We don't know what happened.

223
00:18:56,642 --> 00:19:06,015
I'll report to you after we
inspect the security cameras.

224
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:15,350
I knew he'd be a mischievous boy,
but I didn't know he'd be this reckless.

225
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:22,015
There will be a meeting to determine
whether he'll be registered today!

226
00:19:22,015 --> 00:19:24,015
- Grand Chamberlain!
- Yes?

227
00:19:24,015 --> 00:19:27,015
No one must know what happened.

228
00:19:27,015 --> 00:19:30,266
Keep that in mind, and find the Prince!

229
00:19:30,308 --> 00:19:34,808
I'll do as you say, Your Majesty.

230
00:19:34,808 --> 00:19:43,015
It seems like a new wind is blowing
ever since the Prince came here.

231
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,600
I hope it's a wind of fortune.

232
00:20:05,015 --> 00:20:08,767
I'd like you and Saeryung
to get engaged soon.

233
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:11,558
What do you think?

234
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:19,391
The Deputy Prime Minister will be the
next Prime Minister unless I cross him.

235
00:20:19,391 --> 00:20:28,475
I need him to make you the next Emperor.

236
00:20:28,475 --> 00:20:33,558
Saeryung is a perfect candidate for a bride.

237
00:20:33,558 --> 00:20:38,975
I know that I won't be able to find
a better bride than her.

238
00:20:38,975 --> 00:20:44,015
But, Saeryung and I are still in school.

239
00:20:44,015 --> 00:20:49,016
And, I need to know her thoughts first.

240
00:21:00,015 --> 00:21:03,517
I'm sorry to disturb you, Your Highness.

241
00:21:03,517 --> 00:21:06,308
Our intelligence in the palace's
Internal Affairs has told me

242
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:10,308
that Grand Prince Hyoin's
son has disappeared.

243
00:21:10,308 --> 00:21:12,015
Disappeared?

244
00:21:12,015 --> 00:21:20,642
I don't know the details, but it appears
he has escaped of his own will.

245
00:21:31,433 --> 00:21:34,391
According to these snapshots
from the security cameras,

246
00:21:34,391 --> 00:21:37,015
a palace attendant must've helped him.

247
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:52,015
What great news to hear for
the Royal Council meeting.

248
00:21:52,015 --> 00:22:00,642
The meeting hosted by Her Majesty
will be a stumbling block for her.

249
00:22:00,642 --> 00:22:04,015
He must've gone to his former residence.

250
00:22:04,015 --> 00:22:07,015
Siyun, find him discreetly.

251
00:22:07,015 --> 00:22:09,558
Yes, my lord.

252
00:22:38,015 --> 00:22:43,058
Dad, why do you want me
to get engaged so soon?

253
00:22:43,058 --> 00:22:46,015
Even if Grand Prince Hyoin's
son gets registered,

254
00:22:46,015 --> 00:22:51,266
he still needs the Royal Kin
and Royal Council's approval.

255
00:22:51,266 --> 00:22:55,225
No one's on the Empress' side.

256
00:22:55,225 --> 00:22:56,350
And?

257
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:01,183
The Imperial Court is in
Prince Hyojang's hands.

258
00:23:01,183 --> 00:23:05,015
I know who's going to win.

259
00:23:05,015 --> 00:23:08,015
I beg to differ.

260
00:23:08,015 --> 00:23:12,015
We have nothing to gain by acting in haste.

261
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:16,308
I want to wait and see who holds the ace.

262
00:23:22,054 --> 00:23:26,301
[Prince Hours]

263
00:23:30,085 --> 00:23:37,725
Tae... Tae Wa... Tae Wang...

264
00:23:37,725 --> 00:23:40,015
Where is he?

265
00:23:48,391 --> 00:23:50,015
Kang Hoo!

266
00:23:50,015 --> 00:23:53,015
You're such a nuisance!

267
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:56,642
You royal loser! Worthless piece of crap!

268
00:23:56,642 --> 00:24:03,183
I'm going to kill you with my
own two hands when I find you!

269
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,517
What?

270
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:16,183
He's not here.

271
00:24:16,183 --> 00:24:20,183
Did something happen to His Highness?

272
00:24:22,308 --> 00:24:26,558
Oh, I see.

273
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:29,099
Okay, got it.

274
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:33,266
I'll call you right away when he does.

275
00:24:33,266 --> 00:24:35,058
Bye.

276
00:24:41,015 --> 00:24:43,015
Did they...

277
00:24:53,517 --> 00:24:56,015
- Did you see Kang Hoo?
- No.

278
00:24:56,015 --> 00:25:01,015
Did you get the background
information on Cho Sangki?

279
00:25:01,015 --> 00:25:03,015
I see.

280
00:25:03,015 --> 00:25:05,015
No.

281
00:25:05,015 --> 00:25:07,015
I don't think he's here.

282
00:25:07,015 --> 00:25:09,225
I sent someone to Seoul.

283
00:25:09,225 --> 00:25:12,433
Good.

284
00:25:12,433 --> 00:25:18,266
Keep an eye on him just in case.

285
00:25:38,225 --> 00:25:43,517
We've come a long way.

286
00:28:01,015 --> 00:28:04,015
Hey! Kang Hoo!

287
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,517
Hey!

288
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:16,475
Hey, Kang Hoo!

289
00:28:16,475 --> 00:28:18,141
Kang Hoo!

290
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:39,015
Hey, Hoo!

291
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,309
Ahhhhhh!

292
00:28:54,015 --> 00:28:58,015
You mean you left because of this bike?

293
00:28:58,015 --> 00:29:00,600
Yes.

294
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,517
That's so ridiculous!

295
00:29:03,517 --> 00:29:05,015
You jerk!

296
00:29:05,015 --> 00:29:07,015
I'm not dead.

297
00:29:07,015 --> 00:29:08,600
Don't yell.

298
00:29:12,015 --> 00:29:12,975
Fine.

299
00:29:12,975 --> 00:29:15,183
Let's just get out of here.

300
00:29:15,183 --> 00:29:17,015
Go by yourself.

301
00:29:17,015 --> 00:29:18,308
I have some business to take care of.

302
00:29:18,308 --> 00:29:19,642
What business?

303
00:29:19,642 --> 00:29:21,015
None of your business.

304
00:29:21,015 --> 00:29:23,225
What?

305
00:29:23,225 --> 00:29:25,099
You dirty jerk!

306
00:29:25,141 --> 00:29:27,433
How can you be so selfish?

307
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:33,225
If they find out that I helped you,
I'll be fired!

308
00:29:33,225 --> 00:29:35,015
No one will know
as long as I keep my mouth shut.

309
00:29:35,015 --> 00:29:37,016
What if they still find out?

310
00:29:37,016 --> 00:29:39,015
They didn't!

311
00:29:39,015 --> 00:29:41,015
You just got scared.

312
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:45,892
The palace must be in chaos by now.

313
00:29:45,892 --> 00:29:49,015
This is your fault, so you need
to take responsibility for me!

314
00:29:49,015 --> 00:29:50,015
What?

315
00:29:50,015 --> 00:29:52,350
Are you asking me to marry you?

316
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:55,015
What?

317
00:29:55,015 --> 00:29:58,266
I can't do that. I'd rather die.

318
00:30:01,141 --> 00:30:03,642
I must've gone mad.

319
00:30:03,642 --> 00:30:06,517
I shouldn't have helped you.
I'm the crazy one.

320
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,558
Well, you did help me.

321
00:30:11,558 --> 00:30:13,015
Thanks.

322
00:30:15,015 --> 00:30:16,015
I'm going with you.

323
00:30:16,015 --> 00:30:17,015
What?

324
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:20,725
I'll be dead if I don't take
you with me anyway.

325
00:30:20,725 --> 00:30:22,015
Suit yourself.

326
00:30:28,308 --> 00:30:29,225
Bye.

327
00:30:38,015 --> 00:30:41,725
You're such a nuisance.

328
00:30:41,725 --> 00:30:44,767
The palace must be in chaos right now.

329
00:30:44,767 --> 00:30:46,850
This is the same as running away.

330
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,558
Geez!

331
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:51,015
Hey! Kang Hoo!

332
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,600
Stop yelling before I turn deaf!

333
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,600
You're so irresponsible, you jerk!

334
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,015
Don't call me a jerk!

335
00:30:59,015 --> 00:31:00,350
Coward.

336
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,350
You're such a coward!

337
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,099
What?

338
00:31:03,099 --> 00:31:07,600
If you really hate the palace,
then go and say so!

339
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,015
Don't run away like this,
and ruin my life, too!

340
00:31:11,015 --> 00:31:18,015
You're not royalty! You're too
inconsiderate and selfish!

341
00:31:18,015 --> 00:31:20,015
You're a dirty and irresponsible coward!

342
00:31:20,015 --> 00:31:23,016
You're such an obnoxious jerk!

343
00:31:23,016 --> 00:31:24,058
Do whatever you want!

344
00:31:24,058 --> 00:31:27,934
You don't deserve the people's respect!

345
00:31:27,934 --> 00:31:31,016
I don't even want royalty like you!

346
00:31:54,475 --> 00:31:57,015
Yang Sooneui!

347
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:58,350
What?

348
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,266
Are you going to walk?

349
00:32:00,266 --> 00:32:02,099
Hop on.

350
00:32:02,141 --> 00:32:03,099
Okay.

351
00:32:09,015 --> 00:32:11,308
I don't even want an attendant like you!

352
00:32:11,308 --> 00:32:12,892
What?

353
00:32:27,442 --> 00:32:31,271
[Prime Minister Han Euihyun]

354
00:32:32,015 --> 00:32:43,850
Does anyone have anything to say about
registering and appointing the Prince?

355
00:32:45,433 --> 00:32:53,475
I will now officially register
and appoint the Prince.

356
00:32:53,475 --> 00:32:57,015
As an official member of the Royal Family,

357
00:32:57,015 --> 00:33:06,015
he is entitled to the benefits
and rights given by the country.

358
00:33:06,015 --> 00:33:07,225
Wait!

359
00:33:07,225 --> 00:33:09,225
What is it?

360
00:33:09,225 --> 00:33:13,683
I heard that Prince Yi Hoo has
left his quarters without permission

361
00:33:13,683 --> 00:33:16,767
and is missing.

362
00:33:16,767 --> 00:33:24,058
I'd like you, Mr. Prime Minister,
to say something about this.

363
00:33:24,058 --> 00:33:26,882
Same here.

364
00:33:26,882 --> 00:33:28,582
That's right.

365
00:33:30,015 --> 00:33:35,558
I'd like to say something.

366
00:33:35,558 --> 00:33:43,015
We can't confirm that here.
And, even if we could,

367
00:33:43,015 --> 00:33:46,391
that has nothing to do with this.

368
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:47,892
What do you mean?

369
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:49,808
Of course it matters!

370
00:33:49,808 --> 00:34:01,725
We're trying to determine if he's qualified
to be a member of the Imperial Court.

371
00:34:01,725 --> 00:34:07,183
Why are we having a meeting if we don't care

372
00:34:07,183 --> 00:34:10,015
whether he left the palace
without permission?

373
00:34:10,015 --> 00:34:14,683
We should first find out
if this is true or not.

374
00:34:14,683 --> 00:34:16,058
If this is true...

375
00:34:16,058 --> 00:34:22,642
then we don't know what dumb
things he's up to right now?

376
00:34:22,642 --> 00:34:25,015
Dumb things?

377
00:34:25,015 --> 00:34:28,350
He's of direct royal lineage!

378
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:31,225
Watch what you say about Prince Youngsung!

379
00:34:31,225 --> 00:34:35,391
I'm only saying that
if that's what's going on.

380
00:34:35,391 --> 00:34:39,015
Prince Youngsung?

381
00:34:39,015 --> 00:34:42,141
Don't call him by that name!

382
00:34:43,308 --> 00:34:48,058
I have an idea.

383
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:55,099
Why don't we adjourn the meeting and
ask the Imperial Court what happened?

384
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:05,308
That seems to be a good idea.

385
00:35:05,308 --> 00:35:13,391
Let's adjourn the meeting for now
and continue after we find out.

386
00:35:32,015 --> 00:35:34,433
The meeting was adjourned?

387
00:35:36,015 --> 00:35:39,391
How did it come to this?

388
00:35:39,391 --> 00:35:42,015
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

389
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:44,391
It's Prince Hyojang!

390
00:35:44,391 --> 00:35:50,016
His has his men everywhere in the palace!

391
00:36:01,433 --> 00:36:05,015
Your ID Card says Kang Hoo.

392
00:36:05,015 --> 00:36:07,558
But, my real name is Yi Hoo!

393
00:36:07,558 --> 00:36:09,433
I'm the Prince!

394
00:36:10,767 --> 00:36:13,141
I'm a palace attendant.

395
00:36:13,141 --> 00:36:17,308
This is His Highness Prince Yi Hoo.

396
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,015
I don't know anything about that.

397
00:36:19,015 --> 00:36:22,141
I was in there until yesterday!

398
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,433
Stop it!

399
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:29,642
I can arrest you for trespassing
and hand you over to the police!

400
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:33,934
Wait right here.

401
00:36:33,934 --> 00:36:37,266
I'll get the Grand Chamberlain.

402
00:36:41,015 --> 00:36:43,808
Hey!

403
00:36:43,808 --> 00:36:45,808
Stay right here, okay?

404
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:05,892
Please try again.

405
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,099
What's going on?

406
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:11,015
Please try again.

407
00:37:16,015 --> 00:37:18,015
- What are you doing here?
- Pardon?

408
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,864
[Prince Hours]

409
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:32,015
Nice.

410
00:37:54,099 --> 00:37:57,015
Is that a real gun?

411
00:38:01,934 --> 00:38:03,099
Why isn't she here yet?

412
00:38:36,558 --> 00:38:38,391
Hello.

413
00:38:38,391 --> 00:38:41,141
Your Highness, what are you doing here?

414
00:38:41,141 --> 00:38:44,558
I'm just... waiting for someone.

415
00:38:44,558 --> 00:38:46,432
Do you have a visitor?

416
00:38:46,432 --> 00:38:52,183
Huh? Yes... So, what are you doing here?

417
00:38:52,183 --> 00:38:57,015
I have to do something for an
event hosted by the Imperial Court.

418
00:38:57,015 --> 00:39:00,433
It'll be nice if you could come.

419
00:39:00,433 --> 00:39:03,266
Would you like to come
with me if you're not busy?

420
00:39:08,225 --> 00:39:11,058
Wow, this bike is nice!

421
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:14,350
Yes, I just fixed it up!

422
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:16,600
Can you ride a motorcycle?

423
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,015
How cool!

424
00:39:20,015 --> 00:39:24,015
Are you telling the truth?

425
00:39:24,015 --> 00:39:29,016
Believe me, His Highness
is waiting at the gate!

426
00:39:37,015 --> 00:39:41,015
Okay, I'll believe you.

427
00:39:41,015 --> 00:39:46,183
But, you'll be punished if you're lying.

428
00:40:03,183 --> 00:40:04,892
Where is he?

429
00:40:04,892 --> 00:40:09,015
He was here a minute ago.

430
00:40:57,015 --> 00:41:07,725
Since we don't know where the Prince is,
I'll postpone your punishment.

431
00:41:07,725 --> 00:41:14,015
But, even if he comes back safely,

432
00:41:14,015 --> 00:41:20,767
you still need to pay the
price for what you've done.

433
00:41:20,767 --> 00:41:26,015
The Imperial Court's Justice Committee
will decide what to do with you.

434
00:41:26,015 --> 00:41:35,433
Until then, your privileges as a
palace attendant will be revoked.

435
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:48,767
Hi, this is Yang Sooneui's cell phone.

436
00:41:48,767 --> 00:41:53,058
Please leave a message.

437
00:41:53,058 --> 00:41:56,183
Darn, maybe I should've stayed there.

438
00:41:59,015 --> 00:42:01,015
Is something wrong?

439
00:42:01,015 --> 00:42:02,767
Nothing's wrong.

440
00:42:02,767 --> 00:42:06,015
Now that you're here, I'll just head back.

441
00:42:06,015 --> 00:42:09,141
No way!

442
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:15,350
I have something I want to show you.

443
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:21,015
You'll have to participate in a lot of
Imperial Court activities from now on.

444
00:42:21,015 --> 00:42:22,350
Let's go!

445
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,058
You brought this upon yourself.
Don't blame anyone!

446
00:42:51,058 --> 00:42:53,015
Follow me!

447
00:42:56,266 --> 00:43:01,141
Maybe he's being threatened by them again.

448
00:43:01,141 --> 00:43:04,350
I think he's in Seoul.

449
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:10,015
The Captain of the Royal
Guard is still looking for him.

450
00:43:10,015 --> 00:43:15,015
Since everyone knows who the Prince is...

451
00:43:15,015 --> 00:43:19,600
Prince Hyojang won't be able to harm him.

452
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,225
Don't worry too much.

453
00:43:24,225 --> 00:43:28,308
I thought he was a branch out of firm roots.

454
00:43:28,308 --> 00:43:35,308
I thought he'd have his father's qualities.

455
00:43:35,308 --> 00:43:37,015
Your Majesty...

456
00:43:37,015 --> 00:43:43,015
But, I guess my hopes were in vain.

457
00:43:43,015 --> 00:43:53,015
Your Majesty, remember what we
said when you first took the throne?

458
00:43:53,015 --> 00:44:02,015
You were afraid and thought you
weren't ready to be the Empress.

459
00:44:02,015 --> 00:44:05,015
I remember....

460
00:44:05,015 --> 00:44:11,015
And, you told me I have
nothing to be afraid of

461
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:20,015
as long as I'm willing to serve
my country and people.

462
00:44:20,015 --> 00:44:25,015
Everything needs time.

463
00:44:25,015 --> 00:44:35,015
The Prince needs to have the heart
to do so before he becomes qualified.

464
00:44:35,015 --> 00:44:42,350
When will he have the heart
to be Crown Prince?

465
00:44:48,558 --> 00:44:52,266
His Highness Prince Moonsung is here.

466
00:45:07,725 --> 00:45:10,015
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

467
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:17,015
Her Majesty is not in a good mood today.
She's not accepting visitors.

468
00:45:17,015 --> 00:45:21,350
You should go back.

469
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:51,225
I think Attendant Yang will be fired.

470
00:45:51,225 --> 00:45:52,015
Really?

471
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:53,099
Of course!

472
00:45:53,099 --> 00:45:56,015
She helped the Prince run away.

473
00:45:56,015 --> 00:45:59,099
She'll get fired even if he comes back.

474
00:46:07,015 --> 00:46:09,015
You jerk!

475
00:46:10,558 --> 00:46:12,767
You jerk!

476
00:46:16,225 --> 00:46:19,015
It's okay.

477
00:46:19,015 --> 00:46:22,517
Nothing will go wrong.

478
00:46:22,517 --> 00:46:26,015
It's okay. Don't cry!

479
00:46:31,183 --> 00:46:33,015
Use this.

480
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:41,725
It's okay, Your Highness.

481
00:46:41,725 --> 00:46:43,433
Use it.

482
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,767
Or else you're embarrassing me.

483
00:46:48,475 --> 00:46:50,015
Thank you.

484
00:47:00,725 --> 00:47:04,350
Are you in a relationship with the Prince?

485
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:06,642
Huh?

486
00:47:06,642 --> 00:47:09,015
No.

487
00:47:09,015 --> 00:47:10,141
Don't worry...

488
00:47:10,141 --> 00:47:13,015
Even the palace has clemency.

489
00:47:21,015 --> 00:47:22,015
Hello?

490
00:47:23,225 --> 00:47:26,600
Hold on, Mom.

491
00:47:33,015 --> 00:47:34,015
Me?

492
00:47:35,934 --> 00:47:38,015
I'm doing fine.

493
00:47:41,015 --> 00:47:42,015
Really?

494
00:47:44,015 --> 00:47:46,015
Do you trust me?

495
00:47:49,016 --> 00:47:51,225
Mom...

496
00:47:51,225 --> 00:47:54,015
I'm sorry.

497
00:47:54,015 --> 00:47:56,725
No, nothing's wrong.

498
00:47:56,725 --> 00:48:00,308
I just feel bad for not calling too often.

499
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:26,016
This is a reenactment of the enthronement.

500
00:48:32,015 --> 00:48:35,350
There are many events hosted
by the Imperial Court.

501
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:40,350
All proceeds from this event will be donated
to UNICEF for impoverished children.

502
00:48:48,015 --> 00:48:49,475
Your Highness!

503
00:48:55,475 --> 00:48:57,767
Hold on.

504
00:48:59,433 --> 00:49:01,725
Did you look into what I asked you?

505
00:49:01,725 --> 00:49:04,016
Yes, I looked into it...

506
00:49:04,016 --> 00:49:06,808
Good.

507
00:49:18,015 --> 00:49:21,015
You two are so dead.

508
00:49:24,058 --> 00:49:30,015
I was going to tell on you guys,
but decided to take it like a man.

509
00:49:30,015 --> 00:49:34,015
What are you talking about?
Did we tell you to watch?

510
00:49:34,015 --> 00:49:35,015
What?

511
00:49:35,015 --> 00:49:37,015
He's right.

512
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:39,475
We never asked you to watch with us.

513
00:49:41,015 --> 00:49:44,015
Fine then. Let's say that's true.

514
00:49:44,015 --> 00:49:48,015
Then, why'd you leave me by
myself at the last minute?

515
00:49:48,015 --> 00:49:54,850
I can't stand dirty rascals like you guys.

516
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:59,015
Tell me how many punches do you want?

517
00:49:59,015 --> 00:50:01,725
Let's talk it out.

518
00:50:01,725 --> 00:50:05,015
No. He's a big talker.

519
00:50:05,015 --> 00:50:07,892
Alright, then let's duke it out!

520
00:50:07,892 --> 00:50:10,015
Stop it!

521
00:50:15,015 --> 00:50:18,308
This is Prince Yi Hoo.

522
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:20,015
Pay your respects.

523
00:50:20,015 --> 00:50:22,391
Prince Yi Hoo?

524
00:50:22,391 --> 00:50:24,015
You mean...

525
00:50:28,266 --> 00:50:30,015
I'm late, Mother.

526
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:32,015
What happened?

527
00:50:32,015 --> 00:50:35,225
You're never late.

528
00:50:35,266 --> 00:50:37,015
I'll be more careful from now on.

529
00:50:38,266 --> 00:50:40,015
Hey.

530
00:50:43,015 --> 00:50:46,015
The Royal Council meeting has been adjourned.

531
00:50:46,015 --> 00:50:49,015
You mean he's not registered yet?

532
00:50:51,015 --> 00:50:58,099
Joon, you have nothing to
worry even if he's here.

533
00:50:58,141 --> 00:51:06,725
Just follow your father's lead and
a throne will be waiting for you in the end.

534
00:51:06,725 --> 00:51:12,475
You must be the Emperor,
for your mother's sake.

535
00:51:15,015 --> 00:51:17,015
Let's go inside.

536
00:51:22,015 --> 00:51:29,015
Anyway, it was very manly of you
to keep silent about what we did.

537
00:51:29,015 --> 00:51:34,350
We apologize for putting you
in a bad situation that day.

538
00:51:35,308 --> 00:51:39,015
Well, since you say that...

539
00:51:39,015 --> 00:51:42,642
After all, real men are of few words.

540
00:51:42,642 --> 00:51:45,015
A man's got to watch his mouth, right?

541
00:51:45,015 --> 00:51:49,350
Watching men reconcile is pretty interesting.

542
00:51:51,225 --> 00:51:58,015
Gentlemen, how was the women's dressing room?

543
00:51:58,015 --> 00:52:06,015
As a student, it was a
good learning experience.

544
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:13,892
It was an opportunity to gaze upon
the blossoming female body...

545
00:52:16,015 --> 00:52:21,015
And, well... the body is a piece of art...

546
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:33,850
I hope you'll be more understanding of
us gentlemen's need to appreciate art.

547
00:52:36,099 --> 00:52:39,683
What an interesting way to put it.

548
00:52:39,683 --> 00:52:41,015
Your Highness...

549
00:52:41,015 --> 00:52:44,266
I need to talk to the people
who are preparing this event.

550
00:52:44,266 --> 00:52:48,517
You should wait here
with these dirty gentlemen.

551
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:07,183
Joon!

552
00:53:15,015 --> 00:53:17,975
When did you get here with him?

553
00:53:17,975 --> 00:53:19,015
Who?

554
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:22,391
Ah.

555
00:53:22,391 --> 00:53:26,725
His Highness was kind enough to
give me a ride here.

556
00:53:26,725 --> 00:53:28,015
A ride?

557
00:53:29,015 --> 00:53:34,308
Like delivering black-bean noodles?

558
00:53:34,308 --> 00:53:37,266
I hope you don't get the wrong idea.

559
00:53:37,266 --> 00:53:39,015
The wrong idea?

560
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:45,015
I just want to know who your rival is.

561
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:50,850
After all, he's a candidate.

562
00:53:55,015 --> 00:53:57,058
I'm going to be the best woman.

563
00:53:57,099 --> 00:54:02,433
And, of course, I need the
best man to be by my side.

564
00:54:02,517 --> 00:54:05,642
And, as of now, that's you.

565
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:07,015
So don't worry.

566
00:54:07,015 --> 00:54:10,015
Should I say thank you?

567
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:13,350
Why?

568
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:16,015
You now have two cards to choose from.

569
00:54:16,015 --> 00:54:18,058
He needs to be up to par.

570
00:54:26,015 --> 00:54:29,183
Hello, Your Highness.

571
00:54:36,391 --> 00:54:40,307
[Prince Hours]

572
00:54:51,225 --> 00:54:53,850
I wonder if Sooneui is okay.

573
00:55:03,015 --> 00:55:06,015
What are you doing here, Your Highness?

574
00:55:06,015 --> 00:55:09,015
What?

575
00:55:09,015 --> 00:55:14,015
Did you get Her Majesty's
permission to leave the palace?

576
00:55:14,015 --> 00:55:16,016
Of course.

577
00:55:16,016 --> 00:55:22,058
Although you've grown up
with roughnecks from the streets,

578
00:55:22,058 --> 00:55:28,099
you must maintain your dignity as royalty.

579
00:55:28,099 --> 00:55:32,015
You can't enter and leave
the palace like that.

580
00:55:32,015 --> 00:55:36,015
I don't think that's any of your business.

581
00:55:36,015 --> 00:55:41,015
If a future successor to the
throne leaves without permission,

582
00:55:41,015 --> 00:55:45,015
the palace will be in chaos.

583
00:55:45,015 --> 00:55:48,015
Don't you have any discernment?

584
00:55:48,015 --> 00:55:52,015
If the people find out...

585
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:56,015
how will they respect and trust royalty?

586
00:55:56,015 --> 00:56:01,850
I'm stunned at how much
you lack common sense.

587
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:03,391
Those are fighting words!

588
00:56:03,391 --> 00:56:06,016
Go back right now.

589
00:56:06,016 --> 00:56:08,558
Let's pretend we didn't see
each other here today.

590
00:56:08,558 --> 00:56:10,517
I came here of my own free will!

591
00:56:10,517 --> 00:56:12,015
Free will!

592
00:56:12,015 --> 00:56:19,808
Above free will, royalty must consider
responsibility and duty as priority no. 1.

593
00:56:19,808 --> 00:56:23,308
Otherwise, he'll only be a
shell of someone who's royal.

594
00:56:23,308 --> 00:56:25,015
Shell?

595
00:56:25,015 --> 00:56:27,225
What did you just say?

596
00:56:46,015 --> 00:56:50,767
Now that you've come to your
senses, go back to the palace.

597
00:56:53,729 --> 00:56:54,712
Move it!

598
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:02,015
It's up to me to decide whether
I'll go back or not! Got that?

599
00:57:09,099 --> 00:57:11,517
Captain, what are you doing?

600
00:57:11,517 --> 00:57:13,183
Stop it, please.

601
00:57:21,015 --> 00:57:24,015
There are many people watching.

602
00:57:26,016 --> 00:57:31,350
I think the two of you,
Highnesses, must stop now.

603
00:57:31,433 --> 00:57:34,015
You're right.

604
00:57:34,015 --> 00:57:36,141
I was wrong.

605
00:57:36,266 --> 00:57:39,391
The two Highnesses?

606
00:57:39,391 --> 00:57:41,475
You mean... he's...

607
00:57:43,308 --> 00:57:45,558
You should say hello, Your Highness.

608
00:57:45,558 --> 00:57:52,015
This is Prince Moonsung Joon Lee,
King Eunchin's grandson

609
00:57:52,015 --> 00:57:54,642
and Grand Prince Hyojang's son.

610
00:57:56,015 --> 00:58:02,015
You two are second cousins.

611
00:58:43,308 --> 00:58:47,683
Excuse me. Who are you?

612
00:58:55,183 --> 00:58:57,016
Your Majesty...

613
00:59:50,998 --> 00:59:52,084
[Prince Hours]

614
00:59:52,084 --> 00:59:57,886
The reason why I personally came here
is to give you an opportunity.

615
00:59:57,886 --> 00:59:58,386
An opportunity?

616
00:59:59,111 --> 01:00:02,928
Leaving the palace...
An opportunity for you to return here.

617
01:00:02,928 --> 01:00:05,282
There was a court lady who
helped me leave the palace...

618
01:00:05,282 --> 01:00:07,635
I was wondering what happened to her.

619
01:00:07,635 --> 01:00:12,457
That attendant will find it
difficult to stay in the palace.

620
01:00:12,905 --> 01:00:15,773
Don't ever appear before me again! Got it?

621
01:00:16,504 --> 01:00:18,231
Can we trust Grand Prince Hyojang?

622
01:00:18,231 --> 01:00:20,684
There seems to be no
other way, Your Majesty.

623
01:00:21,779 --> 01:00:24,741
If the Inspector Court Lady
sees me, I'm dead meat!

624
01:00:25,112 --> 01:00:27,299
I'm sorry. Please help me just once!

625
01:00:27,594 --> 01:00:29,143
She becomes more interesting
the more I see her.

626
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:32,199
This is not a simple matter
of exiting the palace,

627
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:37,549
but damaging the Empress and the
authority of the Imperial Court!

628
01:00:37,602 --> 01:00:42,555
He had no idea of his identity and lived
as a commoner for 20 years.

629
01:00:42,846 --> 01:00:46,279
It, indeed, was a scandalous matter...

630
01:00:46,279 --> 01:00:52,225
But, no one can deny that the
Prince is a royal descendant.

631
01:00:52,393 --> 01:00:54,669
You left the palace without
permission. Was there a reason?

632
01:00:54,669 --> 01:00:59,000
After the incident, public opinion has been
negative. How do you feel about that?

633
01:00:59,292 --> 01:01:03,605
I feel... happy about it.

634
01:01:03,605 --> 01:01:06,736
The world is ready to welcome you, Your Highness.

635
01:01:06,736 --> 01:01:09,866
Are you ready to face the new world?
