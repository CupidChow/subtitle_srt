00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:36,871
EPISODE 1

2
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:52,136
{\an8}<i>The urban jungle moves at a pace so</i>
<i>frantic that no one has a moment to spare.</i>

3
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:58,392
{\an8}<i>If you were to describe the mankind</i>
<i>that lives there in a single phrase...</i>

4
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:03,439
{\an8}Homo Laundrycus.

5
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:05,316
{\an8}The laundering human.

6
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:11,030
{\an8}Until the day we die,
the laundry piles up again and again.

7
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:17,203
{\an8}And mankind's effort to wash away
that filthy grime? It's never stopped.

8
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,039
<i>Gu Pan-su, known as the Coin King,</i>

9
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:22,416
<i>was arrested for manipulating</i>
<i>the cryptocurrency market.</i>

10
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,960
<i>On appeal, he received a fine</i>
<i>and a suspended sentence.</i>

11
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:29,215
<i>The ruling has sparked debate among</i>
<i>victims over restitution and compensation.</i>

12
00:01:30,216 --> 00:01:34,386
You can just toss dirty laundry
into the washing machine.

13
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,390
But what do you do with people
who are a lost cause?

14
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:42,603
{\an8}<i>The Sand Foundation held a community</i>
<i>service event at Sand Haven,</i>

15
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,605
{\an8}<i>a child welfare center</i>
<i>in Gyeonggi Province.</i>

16
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:47,441
<i>To mark the center's 10th anniversary,</i>

17
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:51,195
<i>Chairman Jeon Tae-su and 20 employees</i>
<i>took part in volunteer activities</i>

18
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,406
<i>and gifted sports equipment</i>
<i>they purchased with the donations.</i>

19
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:57,576
Welcome to my world.

20
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,518
You're covered in ashes.

21
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:25,354
No matter how hard you try
to brush it off, it can't be shaken off.

22
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,022
What? What do you mean...

23
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:38,909
This is uncontrollable.

24
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:42,746
Yes. Every time she takes an exam,
she starts coughing.

25
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,000
She once got kicked out
so she wouldn't disturb other students.

26
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,127
Mom. That's because of asthma...

27
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,340
-A ghost burned to death is on her.
-What?

28
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,844
It must be purged from deep within.

29
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:59,805
Does that mean we need
to perform a ritual?

30
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:03,309
Mark my words or grave misfortune
will strike in November.

31
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:07,855
We can't afford a ritual right now.

32
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:13,277
This is about saving her life,
and yet you're talking about money?

33
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:18,574
Mr. Kim.

34
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,284
Mr. Kim!

35
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,243
Yes.

36
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:27,875
Get them out of my sight now.

37
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:31,587
How dare you bring these fools
into the holy shrine?

38
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,713
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,341
-Ye-sol, let's go. Ma'am, come with me.
-Wait...

40
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:39,470
-I didn't mean any disrespect.
-Disrespect? Leave now.

41
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:40,888
Get out of my sight!

42
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:44,266
If the truth doesn't get through
that thick skull, maybe some salt will.

43
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,977
Mr. Kim, throw salt at them. Salt!

44
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:48,729
Come with me. Let's go.

45
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,576
Usually, she's fine like that.

46
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:07,539
Ma'am, don't worry
about what she said earlier.

47
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:12,628
Ye-sol just needs to get a few more points
to get into a med school in the city.

48
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,338
So I pushed you too hard, I guess.

49
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,674
My apologies
for making you go through that.

50
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,218
You don't need to apologize.

51
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:22,429
I know you're worried about my daughter.

52
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:26,600
-It's here.
-Yes.

53
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,852
-Ye-sol.
-Ye-sol.

54
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,020
Ma'am, take care.

55
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:37,236
Gosh, it's so tight.

56
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:42,574
Kim Deok-pil, nice.

57
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:44,493
That should be enough
to reel her in, right?

58
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,079
Hop in.

59
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,460
She'll send the money
by the end of the day.

60
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:58,048
That's the thing about the poor.
Their money is as light as a feather.

61
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:01,760
Even the neighborhood
they live in is a total dump.

62
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,470
Are you sure this is worth it?

63
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,353
You have a long way to go, Mr. Kim.

64
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:16,066
It's easier to manipulate the poor.

65
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,903
They barely make a living,
yet they're so greedy.

66
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,905
So they go all in on their kids.

67
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:28,495
I bet that woman will even sell
her store to send me the money.

68
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:30,581
You think so?

69
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,000
If that doesn't work out,

70
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,378
I bet she'd leave her kid
with her own life insurance payout.

71
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:41,675
Gosh, you make brutal jokes.

72
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,100
IM MI-SEON
DEPOSIT: 20,000,000

73
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:51,060
See that?

74
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,282
That woman is shameless.

75
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:59,044
There's only one way to win this game.

76
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,590
Don't be fooled by what you see.

77
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:09,304
What you see right now may be real...

78
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:18,981
But it can also be fake.

79
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:22,484
Oh, my.

80
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:29,783
Ma'am. I'm honored to meet you again.

81
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,953
I appreciate the warm welcome.

82
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:37,457
You look even more elegant
and beautiful today.

83
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,668
People would laugh if they heard that.

84
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:44,923
I mean, why else would a young boyfriend
like him be chasing after you?

85
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:48,385
She's laying it on thick.

86
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:57,853
Red!

87
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,316
This is our signature game,
a modern take on <i>juryeonggu</i>

88
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,652
that our ancestors used to play
while drinking.

89
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:07,946
The chance is 50-50.

90
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,240
The simpler the game is,
the more your blood boils.

91
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:15,621
That's what I like.

92
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,017
White or red.

93
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,688
Do you want to go
with the moon or the sun?

94
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:43,565
White.

95
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:46,360
Go with white for now.

96
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,655
-Let's go.
-No.

97
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,990
-Hey.
-Anyone else who wants to bet?

98
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:56,954
Then we'll check.

99
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:04,670
White!

100
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,382
White!

101
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,146
White or red.

102
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,565
What's your choice?

103
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,734
-Yes!
-All right. Let's do this.

104
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:30,362
Red.

105
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,033
Red!

106
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:37,577
-Red!
-Red!

107
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:41,957
-White!
-White!

108
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,583
White!

109
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,420
Red!

110
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,630
We're rich now!

111
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:51,967
2 WEEKS AGO

112
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:58,140
So this is how someone of your stature
enjoys their leisure.

113
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:04,187
We got you something we knew you'd like.

114
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:07,524
-Call it a gesture of goodwill.
-You shouldn't have.

115
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:13,113
-Oh, this is so precious.
-That was just a bonus.

116
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,033
This is the highlight.

117
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,493
What is this?

118
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:25,250
It's a waste of talent for
the great Gwiyisu of Paldalsan Mountain,

119
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:28,795
who once ruled the scene,
to put up with a young wench.

120
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:33,467
Why don't we strip your boss clean

121
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,052
and set up our own joint?

122
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,558
<i>White and red sound different.</i>

123
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:43,643
Red.

124
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,438
Red!

125
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,023
Red!

126
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,191
Red!

127
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,153
You should stop here for today.

128
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:59,951
Don't be like this.
Let me play a little more.

129
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:04,081
Gambling is meant to stop
when you win money.

130
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,624
Why do you keep telling us to leave?

131
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,046
You ran out of cash.

132
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,173
Is that it?

133
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:18,762
There's no cash?

134
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,973
What's going on?

135
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,271
If you have eyes, take a good look.

136
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:34,194
Here, we always have at least
three billion won in cash ready.

137
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:38,323
Why did you have to say that?

138
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,868
I'm really sorry about that.

139
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:46,248
Okay. I'll play one last round.

140
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,167
All in.

141
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,382
Ma'am, if you raise the bet--

142
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:58,176
Is it time for the young and rich boss
to step forward?

143
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,929
It's the last round.
You all right with that?

144
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,652
In that case,
we'll be switching the dealer.

145
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,761
Shoot.

146
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:53,356
Now, let me roll the <i>juryeonggu.</i>

147
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,583
White or red.

148
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,045
Between the moon and the sun,

149
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,423
what would you choose?

150
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,971
-Red?
-Red? No.

151
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,610
Red... Red.

152
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:39,694
Red.

153
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,404
-Red it is.
-Red.

154
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:42,739
Red.

155
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,035
Then I'll go with white.

156
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:58,880
Shall we check now?

157
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:04,803
Let's see who the goddess
of victory smiles upon.

158
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,947
Red.

159
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,031
It's red.

160
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,663
No way.

161
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:34,833
It's two billion.

162
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,380
This doesn't count.

163
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,591
This doesn't count! It's my money.

164
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:43,550
Let this go.

165
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,760
There's no way I'd make a mistake.

166
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:47,053
This doesn't count.

167
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,471
You're a scammer.

168
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:51,891
You said it was a 50-50 chance.

169
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:52,976
Let go!

170
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:00,442
Let this go, you prick!

171
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,735
You let go!

172
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:09,701
Two billion...

173
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,499
Leave the money behind.

174
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,709
Then I won't kill you.

175
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,512
You think it's that easy to kill someone?

176
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:11,429
What?

177
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,391
You think I can't?

178
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:16,976
All right.

179
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:19,688
Kill me if you can.

180
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,109
I dare you.

181
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:32,325
The cops are here!

182
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:35,036
It's the police! Run!

183
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:39,249
The police are here! Run!

184
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:44,295
Freeze!

185
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,424
Oh, long time no see, Kim Mi-yeong.

186
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,801
Why are you holding a sword?
That's dangerous.

187
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:54,347
Are you performing shows
at the casino now?

188
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,808
You must be so busy.

189
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:03,565
Oh, is this about that bag?

190
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,191
Bring it here.

191
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,152
What? Oh, the bag.

192
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,447
Hurry. Give it to him.

193
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,325
That's mine. Don't touch it.

194
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:15,702
Kim Mi-yeong.

195
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:19,330
You're under arrest for operating
an illegal gambling den

196
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:22,417
and the attempted murder of Park Tae-chun.

197
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,836
Put the sword down.

198
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:27,589
I'm spending my money in my establishment.

199
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,883
How's that illegal or attempted murder?
Are you crazy?

200
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:34,137
And the rest of you.
None of you can get out of here.

201
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,347
You all came here to gamble,

202
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,141
so don't act like you're innocent.

203
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,226
No one's getting out of here. No one!

204
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,103
She's lost it.

205
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:43,021
Take her!

206
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:43,938
No.

207
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,318
-Drop the sword.
-No one's leaving.

208
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,905
Where do you think you're going?

209
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:03,082
Deok-pil.

210
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,335
Baek-hwa, run.

211
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,170
-Deok-pil, are you okay?
-Run for your life.

212
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,505
Come with me.

213
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,925
Don't worry about me. Be happy.

214
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,011
Run! I said go!

215
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:16,721
Now!

216
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:21,059
Goodbye, my love!

217
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,200
Seriously. I thought I was going to die.

218
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,369
That dreadful wench.

219
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:43,081
Goodbye, my love!

220
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:47,877
That shameless kid basically
threw himself at me.

221
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,715
Well, I guess it's my fault.

222
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,887
If it's a crime to be this attractive,
then I guess I'm guilty.

223
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:18,825
Cut.

224
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,957
Are you going to lie there all day?

225
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:31,921
Dang, this disguise is just overkill.

226
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,424
Ouch. I'm too busy for this.

227
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,303
It stings.

228
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:58,865
This one was so much fun.

229
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,284
Stop laughing.

230
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,454
Hey, "my love"? Seriously?

231
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,962
Goodbye, my love!

232
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,715
Hey, that was in the script.

233
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,759
I almost got up because of you.

234
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,594
I only sticked to the script.

235
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:22,180
-Seriously.
-It was hilarious.

236
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:24,432
Be quiet.

237
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,684
Everyone, good work.

238
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,353
Good work.

239
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,106
Well done.

240
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:35,318
My money.

241
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:42,867
Two billion won...

242
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:51,000
What is all this?

243
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:53,962
What is this...

244
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:57,340
My two billion.

245
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:13,272
Kim Deok-pil, you son of a bitch!

246
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,738
My two billion!

STARRING MYUNG GU-HO

250
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:47,223
I can't believe you did that.

251
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,683
Change the dealer?

252
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:50,643
James, does that make sense to you?

253
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:53,312
What's the fun if we only stick
to the script?

254
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:55,231
The best part of a scam is the improv.

255
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,109
I'm all for improv,
but you need to dial it back.

256
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,778
You coming in like that
totally threw me off.

257
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:01,738
That's what I mean.

258
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,323
Still, that look on your face
wasn't so bad.

259
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:07,618
What happened there?
Did you really fall for me?

260
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:10,705
I didn't fall for you. No.

261
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,207
-No...
-Never mind then.

262
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,960
I'm hungry. How about some lobster?

263
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:16,878
Sounds good to me.

264
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:44,739
It's full-bodied,

265
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:49,202
has a delicate nose,
and there's even a subtle wisp of smoke.

266
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:52,705
Montrachet is the best white wine.

267
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:54,791
Montrachet goes down smoothly.

268
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,417
So? Is it France this time?

269
00:22:57,335 --> 00:23:02,507
I went shopping in Paris last week,
and I bought a winery there.

270
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,593
Of course you'd go global
with your investments.

271
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:09,222
So how's the laundering cost this time?

272
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:10,389
Not bad.

273
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:13,101
We saved the production cost
thanks to Mr. Mustache's connection,

274
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:14,560
because he used to be on a film crew.

275
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:17,105
I love it. Amazing.

276
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,024
Why don't we take a trip to celebrate?

277
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:21,984
Sounds good to me. Just the three of us.

278
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:24,654
How about sky diving in Waikiki?

279
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:27,198
How'd you know? That's on my bucket list.

280
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:30,952
That was on your bucket list?

281
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:33,663
It's surfing in Waikiki,
but if I can skydive,

282
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:34,747
that's one shot two kills.

283
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:36,457
I love it.

284
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,587
Gu-ho, you're coming, right?

285
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:44,674
I'll sit that one out.

286
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,051
-What's the fun without you?
-Why?

287
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:51,055
I just don't think this line of work
really suits me.

288
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,056
I'm out.

289
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,432
My goodness.

290
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:54,600
What are you talking about?

291
00:23:54,684 --> 00:23:55,852
I can't do it anymore.

292
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,522
Gu-ho, have you forgotten
about our promise?

293
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:01,649
Oh, the ten billion?

294
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:03,693
We cleaned that out two jobs ago.

295
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,361
-Did we?
-Yes.

296
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,074
What about you do this next job
out of loyalty?

297
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:13,286
I've got some really dirty laundry
to deal with.

298
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,912
So I need you.

299
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,998
Please? What do you say?

300
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,334
Please, will you?

301
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:25,006
-Please?
-I'm off. Bye for real.

302
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:27,466
Don't try to reach me. Goodbye.

303
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,718
Are you leaving?

304
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:31,470
Are you leaving? What about your share?

305
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:35,474
Donate the rest.

306
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:37,351
Really? Jackpot.

307
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:38,436
-Split it?
-Split it?

308
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:41,397
"Split it"?

309
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:44,108
Can't you say goodbye

310
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:47,904
or take care like normal people?

311
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,864
-Goodbye.
-Take care.

312
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,157
Forget it.

313
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:55,870
I'll bet my arm that he'll come back.

314
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:57,914
-I'll bet my foot on it.
-Oh, yes.

315
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,507
1 MONTH LATER

316
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:36,118
Hey. That hurts.

317
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:37,286
CHEONMYEONG SHOP

318
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,622
-What's taking you so long?
-You came just in time.

319
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:41,165
-Ma'am.
-I packed you side dishes.

320
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:44,126
I feel bad every time.

321
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,213
I packed it while I packed some for Bo-ra.
Don't feel bad.

322
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:50,508
-Thank you so much.
-One cone, three popsicles.

323
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:54,136
You little brats.
Do you think he's your wallet?

324
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,097
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

325
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,350
Still, they try to be thoughtful
and avoid picking anything expensive.

326
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:01,978
Hurry up. Let's play soccer.

327
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:04,105
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

328
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:05,523
Wait for me!

329
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:07,775
Hey. Pass.

330
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:08,693
Wait.

331
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:11,195
You need to pass better.

332
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:13,656
Go grab it.

333
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:16,200
Can you throw the ball?

334
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:18,452
Gosh.

335
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:20,746
-The ice cream...
-Look.

336
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,206
-What?
-What is it?

337
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,332
Over there.

338
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:24,250
What is it?

339
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,512
Cool.

340
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:44,520
What?

341
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:03,372
-What…
-What's that?

342
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:06,167
-This is weird.
-Guys, stay here.

343
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,044
-Okay.
-Okay.

344
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,005
It's stuffy in here.

345
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,509
Are you okay?

346
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:19,221
-What's happening?
-Excuse me?

347
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:22,933
Hey!

348
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:27,605
I missed you.

349
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:37,406
-Gosh. Yi-rang.
-I missed you.

350
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,575
What are you doing here?

351
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,536
Seriously!

352
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:46,624
Yi-rang, what are you doing here?

353
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:48,584
Gosh, seriously!

354
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:06,769
Yi-rang, the moment you enter my life,
you ruin the peace.

355
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,979
-Just like today.
-How about this interpretation?

356
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:14,652
A very quiet independent movie met me

357
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:18,781
and becomes
a wild, spectacular mega hit movie.

358
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:21,117
You know, just like the day we first met.

359
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:44,932
Look. A shooting star.

360
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:49,353
Hey, how many shooting stars
do you see a day?

361
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:53,774
If the weather is nice,
you can see 12 easily.

362
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:55,192
-Twelve?
-Yes.

363
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:01,365
That means 12 of my wishes
will come true in a day.

364
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,118
I like it here.

365
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:07,830
Here.

366
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:11,375
Bon appétit!

367
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:14,003
I caught them today.

368
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,380
They're fresh wild abalones.

369
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:19,258
So it should be fancy enough
even for your refined palate.

370
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:25,681
It's not just fancy. This is magnificent.

371
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:29,560
The texture... So yummy.

372
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:36,734
It's annoying.

373
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,987
Why? What is?

374
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:44,992
I mean, I expected you
to be miserable and struggling.

375
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:48,871
But with fresh food and fresh air,
you were doing better without me.

376
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:49,914
Was it fun?

377
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:54,418
You were worried about me.

378
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,755
You know I never worry about anything.

379
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:02,259
I guess those emotions are too much to ask
from someone who was born a sociopath.

380
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:04,970
Gu-ho.

381
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:09,099
I'm not a sociopath.

382
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:15,189
I'm sorry. I was joking.
Don't be so serious.

383
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:19,652
I'm a genius sociopath.

384
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:22,571
So call me a geniopath. I'm a geniopath.

385
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:26,033
Right. I almost forgot I never stood
a chance against a geniopath.

386
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:27,535
Just eat this.

387
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,578
-Gosh.
-Good.

388
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:32,164
This one's perfectly cooked.

389
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,917
JAMES

390
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:37,586
Why is he calling me at this hour?

391
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:41,757
Hello?

392
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:47,972
What?

393
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,432
What is it? What's he saying?

394
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,070
It's all your fault.

395
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:05,322
What?

396
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:09,952
What happened, Yi-rang?

397
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,413
Our plan was perfect.

398
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:15,207
What plan?

399
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:17,626
How did this happen to James?

400
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:19,128
Tell me.

401
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:21,672
Say something, Yi-rang.

402
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,428
Jeon Tae-su.

403
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:30,222
Jeon Tae-su?

404
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:33,058
The chairman of the Sand Foundation,
a public trust.

405
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,938
Ready, set, go.

406
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,483
SAND HAVEN SPORTS DAY

407
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,777
Be careful not to run into each other.

408
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:49,074
One, two, one, two.

409
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:52,745
<i>On the outside,</i>
<i>he looks like an honest business man</i>

410
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:59,043
{\an8}<i>who donates and runs an orphanage</i>
<i>with the money he made.</i>

411
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,045
Bye, kids. See you!

412
00:32:01,462 --> 00:32:03,213
-No!
-No!

413
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:05,341
-Don't go!
-I'll see you again.

414
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:09,261
-Bye.
-Bye.

415
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:13,599
<i>But that's completely fabricated.</i>

416
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:16,310
Well done, sir.

417
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:21,315
-Tell them to bathe the kids.
-Yes, sir.

418
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,233
Gosh.

419
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:37,998
Do you know what the most important thing
is in a relationship?

420
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:42,544
Trust, obviously. It'd be trust, sir. Yes.

421
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:47,091
You say that,
yet you miss the interest due date?

422
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:51,178
That's not it.

423
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:53,097
There's someone who refuses to vacate.

424
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,808
So we ran into a snag
with the land acquisition.

425
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:59,520
And because of that,
the construction got delayed.

426
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:02,231
And I couldn't retrieve the money.

427
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:09,530
Please help me, sir.
This is too much for me to handle.

428
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,867
How long has it been
since we've known each other?

429
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,245
It's been 20 years this year.

430
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:23,419
Sir.

431
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,046
Please.

432
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:33,011
We've spent enough time
for mountains and rivers to change twice.

433
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:37,558
You and I are basically family.

434
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:40,269
Yes, sir.

435
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,396
For sure, sir.

436
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:44,898
We should help each other
when things get tough.

437
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:47,693
We're family.

438
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:50,320
Right, family.

439
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:59,037
Let me settle it smoothly.

440
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,039
Thank you, sir.

441
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:01,999
Thank you!

442
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,376
Thank you so much.

{\an8}Hey. We're going in.

446
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:25,773
We're having seaweed soup today.

447
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:30,652
I just need to bring meat and rice.

448
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,822
Min-su, you're late.

449
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:44,124
Who are you?

450
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,461
Where do you want me to sit, Sister?

451
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,633
Gosh.

452
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:57,679
How can you be eating right now?

453
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:01,350
When someone's about to be buried in debt?

454
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,435
I'm not saying I won't leave.

455
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:05,229
I told you I need to find a place first--

456
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,480
Exactly.

457
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:09,942
Because of you,
we're about to end up on the street!

458
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,153
What are you doing?

459
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:14,363
Tear it apart.

460
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,114
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

461
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:18,700
What are you doing?

462
00:35:27,251 --> 00:35:28,502
Please stop.

463
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:29,753
Please!

464
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:36,552
Stop it.

465
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:37,761
Seriously.

466
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:38,887
Sister!

467
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:42,808
Min-su!

468
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:45,978
-Min-su.
-Get out of my way!

469
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,063

Thanks to you, I was able to start
the construction on time.

475
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:14,131
It's all thanks to you.

476
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:18,468
I will serve you with all my heart.

<i>But in reality,</i>
<i>he's a living legend among loan sharks.</i>

478
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:27,728
<i>A mere loan shark who used to lend money</i>
<i>to merchants and pick on gambling houses</i>

479
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:30,480
<i>became the biggest gang in Gangnam.</i>

It's not enough.

<i>He's the godfather</i>
<i>of the underground economy.</i>

<i>His so-called family is built on trust,</i>
<i>with him at the very top.</i>

485
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:49,666
<i>It's almost like a cult.</i>

486

00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:33,210
<i>Once one betrays, it's over.</i>

490
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:34,753
<i>Your life's done for.</i>

491
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:37,214
{\an8}SAND FOUNDATION
SINCE 1998

492
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:49,351
<i>He got the tip-off that Sand Foundation's</i>
<i>tax evasion is being investigated.</i>

493
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:53,563
<i>The National Tax Service is conducting</i>
<i>a special investigation,</i>

494
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:55,357
<i>and no one knows when they will strike.</i>

495
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,359
<i>But I'm pretty sure it's tormenting him.</i>

496
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:03,240
<i>The public trust is only a shield</i>
<i>to hide his slush fund.</i>

497
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:09,955
<i>Rumor has it that he hid tens of billions</i>
<i>from the National Tax Service.</i>

498
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:17,421
<i>He hid it so well</i>
<i>that no one knows where that money is.</i>

499
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,553
<i>Anyway, now that</i>
<i>the investigators are closing in,</i>

500
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,264
<i>what Jeon Tae-su needs is</i>

501
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:30,767
<i>to take off to another country</i>
<i>with as much cash as he can.</i>

502
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:42,738
KIM HAN-SU

503
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:46,241
<i>And James approached him</i>
<i>at the perfect time.</i>

504
00:38:47,117 --> 00:38:48,952
I'm not worried about the cash,

505
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:52,205
but without my ID and license,
I won't be able to set sail.

506
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:54,124
I'll look into it right away.

507
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:55,333
Thank you.

508
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:57,919
Is this yours?

509
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:04,134
Yes. Thank you.

510
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,845
I don't know how to repay you.

511
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,305
No, it's okay.

512
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:09,598
-Bye now.
-One second.

513
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:15,020
I'll contact you
as soon as I return from Singapore.

514
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:16,229
CAPTAIN KIM HAN-SU

515
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:24,071
How was your trip to Singapore?

516
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:26,990
Thanks to you, I had a good trip.

517
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:28,742
Cheers.

518
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:34,790
What do you think?

519
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,917
It's huge.

520
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,044
Thank you.

521
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:56,853
I think I was lucky to meet you.

522
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:01,399
<i>We were waiting for him to bite the bait.</i>

523
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:04,611
<i>Then Jeon Tae-su suddenly</i>
<i>reached out to us.</i>

524
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:11,451
Captain, may I ask you for a big favor?

525
00:40:11,785 --> 00:40:14,663
What's there to hesitate between us?

526
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,289
What can be so big?

527
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:17,332
Tell me anything.

528
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:19,376
Excuse me.

529
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:25,006
Actually there's something
I want to send abroad from Seoul.

530
00:40:26,383 --> 00:40:31,012
<i>When James couldn't reach me,</i>
<i>he proceeded alone.</i>

531
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,893
-We're from the Customs Office!
-Who are you?

532
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:38,770
Get out of the way. We're on duty.

533
00:40:38,854 --> 00:40:39,688
Make way.

534
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,190
-Get out.
-Get out of the way.

535
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:43,108
Open it.

536
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:49,239
-What the?
-There's nothing.

537
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:56,204
<i>Are you saying Jeon Tae-su caught on?</i>

538
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:15,307
<i>Yes.</i>

539
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:18,518
<i>Jeon Tae-su did this to James.</i>

540
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:21,354
PATIENT: JAMES
DIAGNOSIS: MULTIPLE FRACTURES

541
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:22,314
I should've been there.

542
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:25,775
What should I do if James doesn't wake up?

543
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,195
I'll do it.

544
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:30,197
Do what?

545
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,616
I'll take revenge for James.

546
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:34,868
No. That's too dangerous.

547
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:37,037
Then are you going to let him
get away with this?

548
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:42,417
Jeon Tae-su.

549
00:41:43,752 --> 00:41:47,589
I'm going to take every penny he's got.

550
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:54,012
If that's his hell, I'll give him hell.

551
00:41:57,474 --> 00:41:59,809
I'm just as angry as you are,
but this is too dangerous.

552
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:01,895
James is my family.

553
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:05,732
Isn't he yours?

554
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:11,655
-James, I suddenly got a question.
-Yes?

555
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:15,700
Who's saved as number one in your phone?

556
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:18,828
-All of a sudden?
-I'm suddenly curious.

557
00:42:18,912 --> 00:42:20,330
Of course, it's you.

558
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,501
What are you talking about?

559
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:29,297
GU-HO

560
00:42:29,381 --> 00:42:31,174
You're always my number one.

561
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:33,885
What?

562
00:42:36,638 --> 00:42:38,223
Anyway, why is Yi-rang taking so long?

563
00:42:38,932 --> 00:42:39,933
YI-RANG

564
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:43,270
<i>I was always his number one.</i>

565
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:46,481
What? You were his number one?

566
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:50,652
You're right. You got the call earlier
letting us know about his state.

567
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:53,113
What?

568
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:56,700
Then what's my number?

569
00:42:57,367 --> 00:42:58,201
James.

570
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:00,870
-What's my number?
-That's not the point.

571
00:43:00,954 --> 00:43:01,913
Stop it.

572
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:05,125
-Yi-rang.
-Where's his phone?

573
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,725
Gu-ho. Look.

574
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:23,310
-What?
-What do you think?

575
00:43:23,393 --> 00:43:27,439
Like Meonggae that died
holding the enemy's general.

576
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:31,109
I'll sacrifice myself to take his revenge.

577
00:43:31,735 --> 00:43:33,737
-Hey.
-How do I look?

578
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,697
-No. Wait right there.
-What?

579
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,656
-Wait right there.
-Why?

580
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:39,117
-What?
-Put that away.

581
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,786
Besides, it's Nongae, not Meonggae.

582
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:44,664
Never. Please don't do that.

583
00:43:44,748 --> 00:43:47,250
Why not? Oh, is it too sexy?

584
00:43:48,585 --> 00:43:49,753
I knew

585
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:52,547
you were the only one who cares about me.

586
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,590
Me?

587
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:54,507
Yes.

588
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:55,425
-No?
-No.

589
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:58,094
-I said you shouldn't because you can't.
-I can't?

590
00:43:58,178 --> 00:44:00,180
Yi-rang, to be honest,

591
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:02,265
you don't have what it takes to do that.

592
00:44:03,892 --> 00:44:06,519
What are you talking about?
When I have my fortune read,

593
00:44:06,603 --> 00:44:09,773
they say I'm all about
being artistic and attractive.

594
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:11,524
My beauty is my biggest weapon.

595
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,908
Let's be honest.
Have you ever succeeded before?

596
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:22,118
What should I say about your badger game?

597
00:44:22,202 --> 00:44:25,789
You're way too enthusiastic. It's scary.

598
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:28,958
You make a man's desire for romance
shrivel up and disappear.

599
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:31,669
Do you remember the laundry guy before?

600
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:34,089
He turned himself in
just to get away from you.

601
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:36,174
So we didn't get any money

602
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:37,842
and ended up spending
so much for the cost.

603
00:44:37,926 --> 00:44:39,761
-And--
-Enough. Stop it.

604
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:43,598
I'll find another way.

605
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:49,604
How could you say something so mean?

606
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:51,439
You can do it.

607
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:52,649
-Get lost.
-Get lost.

608
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:54,692
You can do it.

609
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:56,945
Jerk.

610
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:26,558
Have you given up on the plan?

611
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:28,226
I already have it ready.

612
00:45:28,685 --> 00:45:29,769
But you were slacking off.

613
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:34,065
You get creative ideas when you slack off.

614
00:45:35,817 --> 00:45:37,360
So what's your plan?

615
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:45,034
The place no one can get out,
even the president.

616
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:48,329
We already failed with the ship.

617
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:49,247
So now,

618
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,167
over there.

619
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:55,253
The sky.

620
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:10,810
Yes!

621
00:46:10,894 --> 00:46:13,980
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>
<i>Thank you for flying...</i>

622
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:45,094
Here's some fruit.

623
00:46:45,178 --> 00:46:47,514
Do you need anything else?
How about some wine?

624
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:50,350
-I'm good.
-Okay.

625
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:52,852
{\an8}SAND FOUNDATION HOLDS EVENT
AT THE CHILD WELFARE FACILITY

626
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:57,273
-Here.
-Do you need anything?

627
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,569
If you had used that brain better,
you'd be successful now.

628
00:47:01,653 --> 00:47:03,863
That'd be a waste of talent.

629
00:47:16,209 --> 00:47:18,461
-Oh, it's cold!
-What the? Are you kidding me?

630
00:47:18,545 --> 00:47:19,420
It's so cold.

631
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:22,090
Don't you know
that I only drink Canadian water

632
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:24,175
from the North Atlantic glacier?

633
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:27,762
-Sorry. The flight schedule was mixed up.
-The flight schedule?

634
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:32,141
What's more important between your crappy
flight schedule or my high-end taste?

635
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:35,603
Did Director Choi hire you? I can tell.

636
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:37,230
Do you want me to fire you both?

637
00:47:37,647 --> 00:47:39,274
Why involve him when it's my fault?

638
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:42,694
How dare you talk back to me?
I could just...

639
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:45,196
Keep it down. It's not like
you rented this plane.

640
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,948
Rent?

641
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:50,285
Only poor people would rent planes.
This whole plane is mine.

642
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,288
-Do you want to get out?
-This will only cause trouble.

643
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:56,332
-If you could please calm down...
-Don't touch me.

644
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:58,543
These pathetic losers.

645
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:00,962
Now go get me the water already!

646
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:04,424
Made from Canadian glacier ice.

647
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:05,550
I'm sorry.

648
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:07,719
-My apologies.
-It has to be from Canada.

649
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:36,748
-Watch out, man.
-You little...

650
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:38,374
My apologies.

651
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:42,837
Gosh. You can't even carry the bag?

652
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:50,762
Seriously? This is so ridiculous.

653
00:48:51,721 --> 00:48:54,724
You're driving me crazy.

654
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:56,934
What are you doing?

655
00:48:57,018 --> 00:48:58,102
This isn't my bag!

656
00:48:58,186 --> 00:49:01,314
Seriously. This is ridiculous.

657
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:04,651
Why do you always have to drive me crazy?

658
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:16,913
Where's the car?

659
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:30,468
-I swear I didn't even touch it.
-What?

660
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:35,390
I didn't know it was your money... Sir.

661
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:37,433
Please I'm begging you.

662
00:49:37,517 --> 00:49:40,687
I'll work like a dog from now on. Sir.

663
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:46,901
You still don't know your place.

664
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:52,740
You've always been a dog.
You were never anything more than that.

665
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:07,797
You'll still have to pay for the interest
before you die.

666
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,341
Open him up to see what we can sell
and dump his body in the ocean.

667
00:50:10,425 --> 00:50:11,634
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

668
00:50:11,718 --> 00:50:14,595
Sir. Please give me one more chance.

669
00:50:21,436 --> 00:50:22,979
That son of a bitch.

670
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:26,983
What's this?

671
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:36,367
Seriously, you're unbelievable.

672
00:50:36,451 --> 00:50:38,327
This isn't my bag!

673
00:50:38,411 --> 00:50:39,996
<i>What are you going to do about my money?</i>

674
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,712
What a coincidence.

675
00:51:19,786 --> 00:51:23,539
Should you really be this relaxed,
Ms. Flight Attendant?

676
00:51:23,623 --> 00:51:27,043
Oh, my. What brings you here?

677
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:29,045
You're more relaxed than expected.

678
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:31,881
I asked around to find you
because I was worried.

679
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:34,091
Oh, that man?

680
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:39,138
He's probably drunk by now.

681
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:50,691
Oh, my. Thank you so much.

682
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:53,945
I didn't know what to do
because I didn't even have your number.

683
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,824
Consider yourself lucky.

684
00:51:58,533 --> 00:51:59,784
Oh, yes.

685
00:52:04,205 --> 00:52:06,916
You know how to drink.

686
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:16,467
Why is life so tough?

687
00:52:16,926 --> 00:52:19,595
You saw how that prick treated me, right?

688
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:21,806
He shouldn't do that
to someone's precious daughter.

689
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:24,433
Right? That's what I mean.

690
00:52:24,517 --> 00:52:26,978
He's not the owner. It's his dad.

691
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:31,983
Only poor people would rent planes.
This whole plane is mine.

692
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:35,945
He's nothing more than a love child.

693
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:40,700
Oh, my goodness. What am I saying?

694
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:42,952
I'm sorry.

695
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:46,664
-I forgot what I just said.
-What?

696
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:48,457
I don't remember either.

697
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:52,003
Oh, my gosh. You're so witty.

698
00:52:55,673 --> 00:53:00,595
-That cute young master--
-No, he's a horrible son of a bitch.

699
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:16,235
Do you want to go somewhere else?

700
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:20,114
-Round two?
-Round two.

701
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,074
Sounds good to me.

702
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:23,784
For round two.

703
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:08,371
Hi. My young master bastard.

704
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:28,474
Hey, film this.

705
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:32,728
Our young master.

706
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:35,982
Are you happy?

707
00:54:40,236 --> 00:54:45,324
One's high, and the other's drunk.

708
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:47,868
What a fantastic couple.

709
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:49,787
-You are stupid.
-Yeah?

710
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:51,455
-You want to die?
-Die?

711
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:55,918
Wake up, young master.

712
00:54:56,002 --> 00:54:58,838
-Hey.
-Hey. Let go.

713
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:07,680
Who the hell are you? Huh?

714
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:11,767
Hey. Put the bottle down
and fight like a man. You cheap jerk.

715
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:15,187
Fine.

716
00:55:15,563 --> 00:55:19,775
Hey. I was a boxer. Bring it on.

717
00:55:19,859 --> 00:55:21,402
Bring it on.

718
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:28,534
Happy?

719
00:55:42,131 --> 00:55:46,552
I don't care whether you spend this money
on gambling or on drugs.

720
00:55:47,178 --> 00:55:48,387
What I care about is

721
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:52,767
how you brought this money
into this country without any trouble.

722
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:56,562
This is my first time.
You have to trust me.

723
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:58,689
Are you trying
to slip out of this by yourself?

724
00:55:58,773 --> 00:56:00,608
I'm doing this because I'm a newbie.

725
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:01,734
-I never--
-Sir.

726
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,736
I need you to take a look at this.

727
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:07,364
Here's the video
of Rising Airlines' love child.

728
00:56:09,075 --> 00:56:11,118
Me? What about me? What?

729
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:15,206
{\an8}RISING AIRLINES' LOVE CHILD

730
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:23,130
Check his left shoulder.

731
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:35,768
A gun?

732
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:51,492
Who are you?

733
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:15,641
YE-SOL'S

734
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,152
SAKWANG REAL ESTATE

735
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:29,155
Hello.

736
00:57:31,073 --> 00:57:34,201
I put the restaurant on the market.

737
00:57:41,876 --> 00:57:42,960
Jeong Ye-sol.

738
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:48,132
How do you know my name?

739
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:50,176
Who doesn't know about you
in this neighborhood?

740
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:53,304
Here. This is for your mom.

741
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:59,310
And if you keep faking your cough,
you'll get sick for real.

742
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:04,023
You've done well in the past,
and you continue to do quite well.

743
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:06,442
So trust yourself.

744
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:08,944
Don't let your mom visit fortune tellers.

745
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:12,156
I'm sorry.

746
00:58:13,908 --> 00:58:16,744
No need to apologize to me. Bye.

747
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,210
What is all this?

748
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:29,381
Let's just...

749
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,260
call it the laundry bill.

750
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:05,167
{\an8}<i>This much evidence could lead</i>
<i>to a search warrant within a month.</i>

751
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:07,503
{\an8}<i>I need to push the timeline forward.</i>

752
00:59:07,586 --> 00:59:10,631
{\an8}<i>What do you want me to do about the two?</i>
<i>Should I keep digging?</i>

753
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:13,842
{\an8}<i>No one outside of these four walls</i>
<i>must know about our meeting.</i>

754
00:59:13,926 --> 00:59:15,052
{\an8}<i>That's how people are.</i>

755
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:18,097
{\an8}<i>They only believe</i>
<i>what they can see with their own eyes.</i>

756
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:21,934
{\an8}<i>Stop spinning that worthless brain</i>
<i>of yours and find a way.</i>

757
00:59:22,017 --> 00:59:23,936
{\an8}That's why I kept you alive.

758
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:27,106
{\an8}<i>We can fool the X-ray by placing</i>
<i>a shielding device in our luggage.</i>

759
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:31,652
{\an8}<i>It's all a set-up.</i>

760
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:33,404
{\an8}<i>You were born to do this.</i>

761
00:59:34,238 --> 00:59:36,282
{\an8}<i>It'd be a shame</i>
<i>to let this talent go to waste.</i>

762
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:37,825
{\an8}<i>What a shame.</i>

763
00:59:39,118 --> 00:59:40,577
{\an8}<i>-What?</i>
<i>-It was almost perfect.</i>

764
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:43,664
{\an8}<i>You know what happens</i>
<i>when you fail to carry out his order?</i>

765
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:45,374
{\an8}I beg you.

766
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:47,835
{\an8}<i>We should enjoy the ending</i>
<i>of our project together.</i>
