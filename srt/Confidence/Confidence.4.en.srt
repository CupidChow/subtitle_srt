1
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,546
See?

2
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,591
I told you
even Mr. Famous would fall for it.

3
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,968
Now, let's start working on other painters
one by one.

4
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:53,804
All right.
Let's wet our whistles to celebrate!

5
00:00:54,597 --> 00:00:55,765
You're talking like an old man.

6
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:56,682
What the heck?

7
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:59,101
Why do good beginnings always end badly?

8
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,394
What the heck?

9
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,111
-What?
-Wait.

10
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:10,237
What's going on?

11
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,495
Over there. That's Mr. Famous!

12
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,413
-It's Mr. Famous. Run.
-Mr. Famous is here?

13
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,754
This way.

14
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,179
Get down, James!

15
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,096
He's gone.

16
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:37,765
Is he gone now?

17
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:38,849
Mr. Kim…

18
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:39,892
What just happened?

19
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,268
Gosh, we almost got caught.

20
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:42,728
He didn't see us, right?

21
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:44,563
-No.
-Right, I don't think he saw us.

22
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:46,190
He didn't see us.

23
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:47,733
He saw us!

24
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:49,443
He must have! He's calling me.

25
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:51,028
-What the heck?
-Calm down.

26
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:53,364
We don't know what's going on yet.

27
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,740
You're an heir to a family empire.

28
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:56,742
-I'm an heir to a family empire.
-Exactly.

29
00:01:57,243 --> 00:01:58,577
I'm the one with leverage.

30
00:01:58,661 --> 00:01:59,912
-I'm the dominant one.
-Answer it.

31
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:01,372
MR. FAMOUS

32
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,332
<i>Hello, Mr. Choi. This is Mr. Famous.</i>

33
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:04,333
Yes, what is it?

34
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:06,710
-Wasn't that rude?
-No, it's fine.

35
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:09,088
-No? Did I sound okay?
-You sounded so polite!

36
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,175
<i>If you're available tomorrow,</i>
<i>could I come see you at your place?</i>

37
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:14,635
No, you're not available.

38
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,595
-I have to answer him.
-Say you can't.

39
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:18,055
No, wait!

40
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:19,390
Well…

41
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:21,934
There's a place I often go to.

42
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:22,893
Let's meet there.

43
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:24,812
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>
<i>Please send me the address.</i>

44
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,939
We don't have a house! What do we do now?

45
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,607
What's he planning?

46
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:29,525
Perhaps…

47
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:31,402
No way.

48
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,070
Did he find out?

49
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,000
EPISODE 4

50
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:53,883
{\an8}Mr. Famous.

51
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,854
{\an8}Do you know Kim Yong-bok?

52
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:11,817
{\an8}Kim Yeon-bok...

53
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,611
{\an8}Kim Yeon-bok…

54
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:17,823
{\an8}Yeon-bok's the name
of a Chinese chef. Geez.

55
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:34,381
I asked if you knew a man
called Kim Yong-bok.

56
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:38,677
I'm not sure who Kim Yong-bok is…

57
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:49,188
My apologies
for not telling you in advance.

58
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:52,483
Why are you apologizing…

59
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,652
I'm sure you felt very uneasy

60
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,820
when I reported your painting.

61
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:58,989
I had to verify something.

62
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:01,575
I apologize again
for not informing you beforehand.

63
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:05,412
Honestly,

64
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,415
I'd be lying if I said
I didn't feel uneasy.

65
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,877
This won't get you involved
with the police

66
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:13,462
or put you in any trouble.

67
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:14,421
That's a relief.

68
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:18,008
But how did you know it was a forgery?

69
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:20,469
Well, to keep it short,

70
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,972
just like how everyone
has their own unique handwriting,

71
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:25,140
all painters have their own
unique brushstrokes.

72
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:28,560
Even the art forgers
have habits they can't hide.

73
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:30,521
You can never ignore experience.

74
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:35,192
I have data on all the art forgers
and art conservators in Korea.

75
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,986
I can see through all of them.

76
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:39,905
Any ordinary appraiser would have
fallen for it. But I'm Mr. Famous!

77
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:42,908
No one can fool me.

78
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:44,535
What's your opinion on appraisers?

79
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,745
Being an appraiser is not an easy job!

80
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:50,749
The history of appraisers
will start with me.

81
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,335
An appraiser doesn't only judge
if the artwork is real or not,

82
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:54,712
but also one's emotions…

83
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:56,422
Geez, that was exhausting.

84
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,716
He's so damn talkative.

85
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:04,304
We didn't think
he'd have data on art conservators.

86
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:05,889
<i>Director of Gallery Fame</i>

87
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,225
{\an8}<i>and seasoned art critic, Mr. Famous,</i>

88
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,352
{\an8}<i>is drawing attention after revealing</i>

89
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:12,396
<i>that a recently sold Elcasso painting</i>
<i>was a forgery.</i>

90
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,315
<i>And now, several other forgeries</i>
<i>he previously identified</i>

91
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,276
<i>are receiving attention again.</i>

92
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,945
Mr. Famous will only get more followers.

93
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:22,823
His clients will trust him even more.

94
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,367
We underestimated him.

95
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,494
We were completely wrong.

96
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:28,912
That's kind of true.

97
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,122
Kind of.

98
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:36,545
He needed a reputation
to make more money before the big event.

99
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,547
And we fell for it.

100
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:41,383
Wait. By big event…

101
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:45,262
do you mean this?

102
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,559
"A charity auction party."

103
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:52,811
He called to give you this.

104
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:54,688
Yeah. He told me…

105
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:56,648
It's time to play in the big leagues now.

106
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:59,485
-Let me invite you to said big leagues.
-Right.

107
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,945
Join us in the big leagues.

108
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,198
"It's time to play
in the big leagues, Mr. Choi."

109
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,366
"Join us in the big leagues."

110
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,868
Then, he gave that to me.

111
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,328
Yi-rang, are you listening?

112
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:10,913
Stop talking.

113
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,248
I'm going to get some sleep.
Don't wake me up.

114
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:19,671
She must be shocked.

115
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:20,589
Right.

116
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:23,842
We should give her some time, right?

117
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:25,844
I think so.

118
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:30,307
Yay, the fried chicken is here!

119
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,601
Fried chicken that's to die for!

120
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:33,852
Sweet and salty!

121
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:36,230
And crispy on the outside
and juicy on the inside!

122
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:40,275
Today, I got some
with special garlic sauce,

123
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,570
which will help boost your immune system.

124
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:45,072
There's no time to sleep.

125
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:48,992
Excessive drinking is bad for your liver.

126
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,452
So let's drink a lot!

127
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:51,787
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

128
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:57,751
By the way, Yi-rang.

129
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:00,629
It's about time
you come up with the next plan.

130
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,298
Of course.
Yi-rang would never give up like this.

131
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:04,258
She would never.

132
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,093
I bet she came up
with an even more wicked plan.

133
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,010
For sure.

134
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,221
We'll find Mr. Famous's list.

135
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:10,764
Mr. Famous's list?

136
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:13,267
The artwork ledger
that Mr. Famous used for deals.

137
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,811
The root of the politicians' slush funds.

138
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,272
Right. But how are we going to find that?

139
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,402
We'll find the answer to that
at this party.

140
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:26,697
Neither Mr. Famous's house

141
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,074
nor his gallery had a place
to hide his weakness.

142
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:32,703
If they are Mr. Famous's public spaces,

143
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,123
this has to be his personal space.

144
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,625
All of his illegal conduct
is committed here.

145
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,463
It must be here somewhere.

146
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:52,097
<i>The operation will begin.</i>
<i>Is everyone ready?</i>

147
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,810
<i>I'm ready, Boss. Let's do this, Olivia.</i>

148
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:08,864
Just you wait, Mr. Famous.

149
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,080
Is this the performing artist's van?

150
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,707
Yes, is everything all right?

151
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,418
Are you the singer? It can't be you.

152
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,961
I'm not the singer.

153
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:25,088
Sir, I think you'll have
to show him your face.

154
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,340
But you're so handsome.

155
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,430
I almost didn't recognize you
without your wig.

156
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,848
Hello. I'm a fan of yours.

157
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,850
Don't you have a TV at home?

158
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,772
The director gave me special orders
to guide you.

159
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,570
Mr. Choi.

160
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:50,697
-Hello.
-Thank you for coming.

161
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:52,324
My pleasure.

162
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:55,202
And may I ask who this is?

163
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,621
This is the Head of Purchasing
for Wonderby Asia,

164
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:58,956
Olivia Kim.

165
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,377
I see.

166
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,755
I've heard much about you.

167
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,632
I'm Choi Seung-chan from LHC.

168
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,468
It's an honor to meet you.

169
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,721
The honor is mine.

170
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:18,558
I would have never imagined meeting
such a beautiful lady like you.

171
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,983
I will take that as a compliment.

172
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,070
I have someone to introduce you to.
Come with me.

173
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:35,075
-What's with that nasally voice?
-What's with that cheesy speech?

174
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:37,744
What?

175
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,799
You must be tired. Get some rest.

176
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,052
I'll find a way to handle the performance.

177
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,644
I got the invitation. I'm going in.

178
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:06,982
Now,

179
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:10,402
we will begin the special auction.

180
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,530
The first painting was donated
by Mrs. Na Mi-hee,

181
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,241
the wife of the leader
of the Jinpureun Party.

182
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:17,576
Ma'am.

183
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,045
There's nothing special about it.

184
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,546
Why is everyone so amazed?

185
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,381
It's a fascinating work.

186
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:33,759
We'll start from seven million.

187
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:34,968
Seven million.

188
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,137
Eight million.

189
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,555
Nine million.

190
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,556
Ten million.

191
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,433
How high will it go?

192
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:44,186
Hey, Yi-rang. Shouldn't I bid too?

193
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,354
Don't do anything stupid.

194
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,857
Now, we'll raise the bid increment
from millions to the tens of millions.

195
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,233
Twenty million.

196
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,360
I'm bidding.

197
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:52,277
Thirty million.

198
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,905
-What's wrong with him?
-Forty million.

199
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,031
Fifty million.

200
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:57,616
Eighty million.

201
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,117
One hundred million.

202
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:03,080
Now, we'll raise the bid increment
to 50 million.

203
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:05,040
One hundred and fifty million.

204
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,124
Two hundred million.

205
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,376
Two hundred and fifty million.

206
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,502
Three hundred million.

207
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:10,879
Three hundred and fifty million.

208
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,047
Four hundred million.

209
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,757
Four hundred and fifty million.

210
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,509
Five hundred million.

211
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:20,722
Anyone for 500 million?

212
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:27,396
Suit yourself.

213
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,273
Anyone else for 500 million?

214
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:32,943
Then…

215
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:35,737
Five hundred million.

216
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:38,740
Five hundred million!

217
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:41,868
What a relief.

218
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:43,620
Sold for 500 million.

219
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,832
Congratulations.

220
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,380
-Please follow my manager for assistance.
-Hey, Yi-rang.

221
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,798
Why are the two leaving together?

222
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:59,636
It's creating a chance to bribe
in the name of a charity auction.

223
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,222
So basically, big spenders
get their favors granted.

224
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,266
Is that how it works?

225
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:05,767
That's right.

226
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:08,145
My goodness. This is just perfect.

227
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:23,243
Here is the last painting.

228
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,913
It was donated by the chairman
of Hundred Victories Group.

229
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:29,916
His wife is present tonight.

230
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:34,921
Okay, then.

231
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:36,298
I will reveal the artwork.

232
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,844
The Intangible Cultural Heritage
Number Two,

233
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,555
the Maltugi Tal
of Yangju Byeolsandae Nori.

234
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:44,931
What? <i>Kkolttugi?</i>

235
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,600
It was created in the late Joseon Dynasty.

236
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,811
And it couldn't be
in any better condition.

237
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:51,521
The bid starts from 100 million.

238
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:52,481
What?

239
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:53,565
One hundred million.

240
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:54,983
Two hundred million.

241
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,777
-Are they buying it for real?
-Five hundred million.

242
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,446
Eight hundred million.

243
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:00,655
One billion.

244
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,073
One and a half billion.

245
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,533
Two billion.

246
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:04,784
Two and a half billion.

247
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:13,585
Three billion.

248
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,295
Hey.

249
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,964
Are you trying to pull the same stunt?
Seriously?

250
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,299
Anyone for three billion?

251
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:21,760
Three billion.

252
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:25,430
Three billion.

253
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:30,435
Three and a half billion.

254
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,562
Sold for 3.5 billion.

255
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,648
Thank goodness.

256
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,525
Congratulations.

257
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,652
We've prepared an after-party.

258
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,238
-I hope you enjoy.
-Three billion, for goodness' sake.

259
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:44,741
He could make several hundred million won
overnight just from commission.

260
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,110
Okay, I got his fingerprint.

261
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:34,457
I got the password!

262
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,667
<i>Password secured.</i>

263
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:40,630
Behind the frame next to the desk.

264
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,134
Darn.

265
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,078
Hey.

266
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,706
You shouldn't have.

267
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,126
I brought snacks to keep your spirits up.

268
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:19,711
-Come in.
-Sure.

269
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,510
-The director told me…
-Yeah.

270
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,638
…to get you non-alcoholic drinks.

271
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,017
-Non-alcohol?
-What a considerate man.

272
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:55,955
CONTROL ROOM

273
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:10,929
The control room has been taken care of.

274
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,265
What's wrong?

275
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:15,642
Are you okay, Olivia?

276
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:24,025
Geez. What is she doing
in the middle of an operation?

277
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:28,780
Do you want to get some fresh air outside?

278
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:31,574
Shall we?

279
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:33,618
Let's do that then.

280
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,206
I feel lightheaded.

281
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:39,791
Oh, boy.

282
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,835
I'm sorry. Be careful.

283
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,070
Gosh, you flatter me.

284
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,910
I'm sorry. I couldn't stop myself.

285
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:59,120
I should've held back.

286
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:00,955
Olivia.

287
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,586
Holding back will make you sick.

288
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,004
Don't hold back.

289
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:26,731
What's that?

290
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,360
Security! Run to my office! Hurry!

291
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,277
Yes, sir.

292
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:32,695
What the…

293
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:45,083
I found it.

294
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,293
I got it.

295
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:00,640
Something wrong?

296
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:04,811
Olivia.

297
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,065
It's dangerous.

298
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:11,025
Stay right here.

299
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:13,194
I'll be right back.

300
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:23,288
Where are you?

301
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,164
<i>-Get out of there now.</i>
-Not yet.

302
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:26,332
Wait.

303
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,334
James, buy me more time.

304
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,379
What? I can't hear you.

305
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,172
What? Stop them?

306
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:35,174
Where are they?

307
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,344
Got it.

308
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,264
To the right!

309
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,604
Jump!

310
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,648
Jump higher!

311
00:19:56,863 --> 00:20:00,950
Okay! Jump!

312
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:05,288
Damn it.

313
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:40,281
Check the control room.

314
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:41,199
Yes, sir.

315
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:48,873
What the heck?

316
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,250
Damn it.

317
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,921
Hey. Wake up.

318
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,756
I think it's all been deleted.

319
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,132
-Hey, check that too.
-Okay.

320
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:13,523
Hey, who are you?

321
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,208
That hurts.

322
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:45,221
CONTROL ROOM

323
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:24,093
What's all this noise?

324
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:25,595
Hey, what are you two doing?

325
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:27,972
Still partying.

326
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:36,939
Damn it.

327
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:57,418
Should I call the police?

328
00:22:57,502 --> 00:23:00,671
Are you trying to tell everyone
that we got robbed?

329
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:02,590
If I lose the VVIPs' trust,

330
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:04,258
how are you going to make up for that?

331
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:05,760
I'm sorry, sir.

332
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,145
What's that car?

333
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:17,772
Stop that car. Now!

334
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:19,398
-Stop that car!
-Yes, sir.

335
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:21,526
Thank you for coming.

336
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,736
Get home safely. Goodbye.

337
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:27,323
Here.

338
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:29,242
Are you sure you're okay?

339
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:30,910
It's nothing.

340
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:32,703
I'm glad to hear that.

341
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,833
Mr. Famous.

342
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:37,750
Thank you.

343
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,127
-Good night, then.
-Good night.

344
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:55,059
Should I turn the heat on?

345
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:56,644
Yeah, to level four.

346
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:00,731
That's not the heat control.

347
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:01,691
I thought it was.

348
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:06,612
It's on.

349
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:07,655
Oh, it's warm.

350
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:11,784
At least let me change my shoes.

351
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:13,327
Come on.

352
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:14,704
-I'm drained.
-Geez.

353
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,038
Why take off your heels--

354
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,249
-I think I got a cold from Mr. Famous.
-Hey.

355
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:20,960
-Geez. Thanks.
-This way. Careful.

356
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,213
Goodness.

357
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:27,383
Good.

358
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:30,511
I'm thirsty.

359
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:31,888
Guys, you want something to drink?

360
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,890
Yeah. Maybe chamomile tea.

361
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,474
No, just drink water.

362
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:37,351
Gosh, that was really close.

363
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:39,020
Let's see what's in this.

364
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,065
FAME WORK TRANSACTION LEDGER

365
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:45,276
-Oh, boy.
-Gosh, I'm so tired.

366
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:48,613
Seriously, that was so close.

367
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,411
This is a huge list.

368
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,329
Really?

369
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:05,963
Let's check out the VIPs
in league with Mr. Famous.

370
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:07,757
This isn't a transaction history though.

371
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:10,426
"M27CH dash one." What's that?

372
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,094
M and F.

373
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:14,013
So, male and female.

374
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,057
Male, 27 years old?

375
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:23,648
What's this?

376
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:40,414
What is this?

377
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:01,102
Gosh, this jerk.
He's an even bigger piece of trash.

378
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:04,188
What kind of ridiculous situation is this?

379
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:09,819
Would you believe me if I said
even bigger works have been created

380
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,070
by my own hands?

381
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:15,157
So he's locking up naive, obscure painters

382
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:17,159
{\an8}and running a forgery factory.

383
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,539
Wait.

384
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:24,333
Kim Bo-ra. 23 years old. Kim…

385
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:31,590
Bo-ra.

386
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:54,613
Hey, stop watching.

387
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,004
JAEHAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

388
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:32,902
Bo-ra.

389
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,419
Are you feeling better?

390
00:27:57,802 --> 00:28:01,555
Hey, your mother is worried
because you're not eating.

391
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:05,476
You should at least pretend to eat
for your mother. Okay?

392
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,945
It's cold today.

393
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:18,322
Do you want to go back inside?

394
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:31,252
I'll go first and talk with your mother.
Take your time.

395
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:36,882
Gu-ho.

396
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,225
Mr. Famous…

397
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,022
He said he'd take a look at my paintings,

398
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:53,357
so I went to see him.

399
00:28:58,237 --> 00:28:59,488
You're here, Bo-ra.

400
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:00,573
It's me.

401
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:04,493
You've gotten better from last time.

402
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:06,704
Really?

403
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,666
You're improving every day.

404
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:26,348
Bo-ra.

405
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:27,808
Yes?

406
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:29,310
How about working

407
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,313
as an intern artist at my company?

408
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,940
An intern artist?

409
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:37,568
After the internship,

410
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:41,572
I'd like to open an exhibition
for people with talent.

411
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:44,200
An exhibition?

412
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:49,455
An exhibition.

413
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:54,293
You could totally be one of them.

414
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:57,338
You're so pretty.

415
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:59,715
<i>A debut exhibition at Gallery Fame.</i>

416
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:05,012
<i>It was the best bait for students like me.</i>

417
00:30:15,523 --> 00:30:17,274
<i>I had to endure it.</i>

418
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,111
<i>I thought that was the only way for me</i>

419
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:23,822
<i>to open an exhibition</i>
<i>and debut as an artist.</i>

420
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:26,909
But…

421
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,420
You scumbag!

422
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:41,006
I did everything you said.
Wasn't that enough for you?

423
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:42,758
The exhibition.

424
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:44,468
You said you'd open it for me.

425
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:46,428
This really is the last time!

426
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:52,142
My hand is not listening to me!

427
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:55,729
But I have to be in the exhibition.

428
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:58,524
Professor!

429
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,152
-I finished it!
-How long do I have to keep painting?

430
00:31:02,236 --> 00:31:04,113
So please stop this!

431
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,824
<i>-Everyone was going insane.</i>
-Let me out of here!

432
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:09,868
<i>And my body was breaking down…</i>

433
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,706
<i>in that short period of time.</i>

434
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:27,803
<i>I kept telling myself to get it together…</i>

435
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:30,889
<i>but it was no use.</i>

436
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:52,119
<i>That kind Mr. Famous</i>
<i>when he was tossing the bait</i>

437
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:54,955
<i>was long gone.</i>

438
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:56,415
Hey, watch it.

439
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:02,755
I kept hearing there were minor mistakes.

440
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,632
I guess it was your work.

441
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:06,342
No, Mr. Famous.

442
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:09,553
If I get some sleep, I'll be okay.

443
00:32:09,637 --> 00:32:11,930
Sleep isn't the issue.

444
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:13,265
The issue is your skills.

445
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,646
But I've been doing well until now.

446
00:32:19,897 --> 00:32:21,982
I've been working really hard.

447
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,234
-Now, the exhibition--
-What?

448
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:26,445
Exhibition?

449
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:28,155
Hey.

450
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:32,451
Do you think you've become a real artist
because you're painting here?

451
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,537
With your disgusting and pathetic skills?

452
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:38,290
You think any damn fool
can hold an exhibition?

453
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:49,551
It's tragic to put in all that effort
with zero talent.

454
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:54,932
But you definitely said I had talent then.

455
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:56,141
"Not bad."

456
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:58,894
"You've improved since the last time."

457
00:32:59,353 --> 00:33:02,981
Do any of those words mean talent?

458
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:06,527
I'll be good.

459
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:09,488
I swear I can be good. Please!

460
00:33:09,947 --> 00:33:12,449
Give me one more chance!

461
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:14,243
Geez, for Christ's sake.

462
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,286
I can show you now.

463
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:18,539
Show me what?

464
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,669
Hey, just get lost.

465
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:26,130
Stop ruining my paintings.

466
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:30,467
Geez.

467
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,684
And don't do anything stupid.

468
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,436
The security camera caught you...

469
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:43,689
taking the drugs on your own.

470
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,441
If you want to call the cops, do it.

471
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,317
Then, you'll become a drug offender.

472
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:50,404
Your mom will be happy to hear
that her daughter is a junkie.

473
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:32,404
<i>What? Exhibition?</i>

474
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:37,701
<i>Do you think you've become a real artist</i>
<i>because you're painting here?</i>

475
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:39,912
With your disgusting and pathetic skills?

476
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:42,498
You think any damn fool
can hold an exhibition?

477
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:44,458
<i>It's tragic to put in all that effort</i>

478
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:46,585
<i>with zero talent.</i>

479
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:58,972
<i>Hey, Kim Bo-ra.</i>

480
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,434
<i>Kim Bo-ra!</i>

481
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,979
No!

482
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:20,702
Hey, are you okay?

483
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:35,968
Hey, Bo-ra. Come on.

484
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:52,234
That damn scumbag.

485
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:02,661
So? How's Purple doing?

486
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:06,164
She's just spaced out all day.

487
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:08,375
Gosh, it must be tough.

488
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:11,128
She was hurt by the work she loves to do.

489
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:15,465
That scum of the earth takes advantage
of innocent passion for his own gain!

490
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:17,175
I'm going to stomp all over him.

491
00:36:18,886 --> 00:36:20,095
This must be it!

492
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,764
Bo-ra's mom's side dish trifecta?

493
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:25,767
Aren't you supposed to ask
how Bo-ra is doing like James did?

494
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:27,102
James already asked.

495
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,396
What's this? I've never seen this before.

496
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:30,355
Is this kimchi?

497
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:31,857
It's fermented flounder.

498
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,984
Bo-ra's mother's family
is from Hamgyong Province.

499
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,569
That's where they learned the recipe.

500
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:36,778
It's not bad. It's tasty.

501
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:42,409
-It's pure art.
-Right?

502
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,496
What did you just say?

503
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:49,333
Nothing.

504
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:50,667
He didn't say anything.

505
00:36:58,008 --> 00:36:59,092
That's it!

506
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:05,223
They don't match the interior design
of the villa I'm moving to.

507
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:09,519
Still, there's more artwork
than I expected.

508
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:11,855
Let me take a closer look.

509
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:21,615
Did your daughter draw this one?

510
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:23,200
Just kidding.

511
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:24,660
That little…

512
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:27,412
You should get rid

513
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:30,123
of all these pieces here.

514
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,085
They don't suit you.

515
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,504
You can't just accept everything
that comes your way.

516
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,255
They're cracked and broken.

517
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:40,258
It's like pouring water
into a bottomless jar.

518
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:04,533
Mr. Choi, is this…

519
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:05,492
Oh, that.

520
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:11,915
That's from 1933.

521
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:13,875
<i>The Sight of the Sea.</i>

522
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:17,129
The name of the painter
is Cheon Myeong-shin.

523
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,382
That name sounds familiar.

524
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,303
It's beautiful.

525
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:30,058
It's so beautiful that it's making me cry.

526
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,484
What year did you say?

527
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:42,863
It's from 1933.

528
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:46,491
From...

529
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:49,453
1933?

530
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:54,541
From 1933?

531
00:38:57,461 --> 00:39:00,922
The next artwork has an interesting story.

532
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:02,716
Perhaps,

533
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:06,303
this is a very valuable piece.

534
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:08,138
Piece number 23.

535
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,515
<i>The Sight of the Sea</i>

536
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:12,809
by Cheon Myeong-shin.

537
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:18,106
It's from 1933.

538
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,357
It's an oil painting.

539
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:21,151
Dimensions are 61 by 50 centimeters.

540
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:27,074
The main thing to focus on is the period
in which this was drawn, which is 1933.

541
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:29,242
That was during
the Japanese occupation period.

542
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:30,869
Unlike other countries that accepted

543
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,913
{\an8}various European painting styles slowly,

544
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:36,875
many painting styles
swarmed into Korea all at once,

545
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:40,420
so it wasn't easy for each style
to mature during that time.

546
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:41,963
However,

547
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:45,926
there is always one genius in every era.

548
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,511
During that difficult period,

549
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:49,846
one obscure painter we weren't aware of

550
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,599
used strong brushstrokes and vivid colors.

551
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:54,017
Like Fauvism and Cubism,

552
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:57,687
as if van Gogh and Cezanne were mixed.

553
00:39:57,771 --> 00:39:59,856
And the artist has
a unique, delicate touch.

554
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,944
To me, it was a refreshing jolt.

555
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:07,489
Now, the decision is up to you.

556
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:08,740
The bid price starts...

557
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,660
from 15 million won.

558
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:13,995
Fifteen million.

559
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:15,831
Sixteen million.

560
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:17,457
Seventeen million.

561
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:18,834
Eighteen million.

562
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:19,835
Nineteen million.

563
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:20,877
Twenty million.

564
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:24,005
We'll raise the bid increment
to 10 million.

565
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:25,173
Thirty million.

566
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,300
-Forty--
-One hundred million.

567
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:41,815
We have 100 million.

568
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:43,066
Anyone else?

569
00:40:44,151 --> 00:40:45,360
One hundred million.

570
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:47,112
Sold!

571
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:54,494
In all honesty,

572
00:40:55,162 --> 00:40:58,248
I never expected you
to say 100 million just like that.

573
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:00,542
Let's call it an investment.

574
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:04,921
Do you think there's only one painting
done by this artist?

575
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:09,968
When this painting was put up for auction,

576
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,970
the seller probably
had another plan in mind.

577
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,640
I keep thinking…

578
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:21,104
we could become the best partners ever.

579
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:24,316
What are you talking about?

580
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,204
KOREAN ART'S HIDDEN GEM FOUND

581
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:40,207
BY DIRECTOR OF GALLERY FAME
AND ART CRITIC, MR. FAMOUS

582
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,585
<i>I'm an investor.</i>

583
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:47,464
Do you think there's only one painting
done by this artist?

584
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:55,972
If Wonderby purchases all the pieces
by Cheon Myeong-shin,

585
00:41:57,474 --> 00:41:59,517
the profit will be enormous.

586
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:06,316
Secretary Kim, it's me.

587
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:10,111
Look up Cheon Myeong-shin's paintings.

588
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:13,365
Now that I threw the bait,

589
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,118
there should be a bite.

590
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:20,121
Sir!

591
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:22,457
I got a call that someone
has a similar painting.

592
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,794
Really?

593
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:39,057
When I got the call,

594
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,102
I searched thoroughly,
like I was combing for lice.

595
00:42:46,398 --> 00:42:47,399
So?

596
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:50,986
Is it one of his paintings?

597
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:59,869
<i>Sensual texture. Dizzying colors.</i>

598
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:04,165
<i>This was definitely painted</i>
<i>by Cheon Myeong-shin.</i>

599
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:08,086
Sir.

600
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,255
Let me take this painting over.

601
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:11,756
I'll pay you triple.

602
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,718
Do you have any information
about this painting?

603
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:17,595
I thought I saw something
written on the back.

604
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:21,641
Oh, there it is.

605
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:25,562
{\an8}CHEON JONG-YEOP
EUNGSAN-EUP, PAEJU-SI

606
00:43:44,706 --> 00:43:48,501
CHEON JONG-YEOP

607
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:52,756
Excuse me.

608
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:55,800
Mr. Cheon Jong-yeop? Are you inside?

609
00:43:57,052 --> 00:43:58,219
I came down from Seoul.

610
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:02,140
-What do you want?
-Geez!

611
00:44:02,724 --> 00:44:03,558
Gosh!

612
00:44:04,017 --> 00:44:06,644
Were you peeping in to see
if there was anything to steal?

613
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:07,854
Mr. Cheon Jong-yeop?

614
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:15,111
Thank you.

615
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,116
Right. Thank you.

616
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:24,204
Every guest who visits my house
must drink one.

617
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:26,414
It's the rule and a rite of passage.

618
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:33,254
I selected only the good herbs
and boiled them in the cauldron.

619
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:34,214
I did it myself.

620
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:37,467
It's good for there.

621
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:38,760
There?

622
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,470
I mean, down there.

623
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:42,347
Do I have to say it? Geez.

624
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:43,264
Down there.

625
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,893
I see. Down there.

626
00:44:47,644 --> 00:44:49,521
Down there. Right.

627
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:51,147
Drink.

628
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,028
Geez, how disgusting.

629
00:44:58,405 --> 00:44:59,406
It reeks.

630
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:04,786
Drink up.

631
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:07,205
I…

632
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:08,873
-It's a rite of passage.
-Okay.

633
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:14,879
-You've passed.
-Thank you.

634
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:17,424
By chance,

635
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:19,759
do you happen to know Cheon Myeong-shin?

636
00:45:21,553 --> 00:45:24,597
Let me think.
Myeong-shin. Cheon Myeong-shin.

637
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:27,142
That sounds familiar… Yes!

638
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:28,184
Yes?

639
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,564
Why are you looking for my aunt?

640
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:35,316
Well, then…

641
00:45:35,692 --> 00:45:37,652
are any of her paintings here…

642
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:41,197
Oh, my. How did you know
that she was a dauber?

643
00:45:46,578 --> 00:45:48,413
-Yes, here it is.
-Okay.

644
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,878
I guess she was born in 1919.

645
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:57,922
Sir, by any chance,

646
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:00,758
could I see her paintings?

647
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:17,358
She was born frail during difficult times.

648
00:46:17,442 --> 00:46:19,694
I heard she came close
to death many times.

649
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,946
But I guess she painted a lot.

650
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:24,365
It seems she won awards at primary school.

651
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:26,993
<i>Goodness, but what's the point?</i>

652
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:30,371
<i>She was born to a poor family,</i>
<i>and she was in poor health.</i>

653
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:35,502
<i>At the time,</i>
<i>canvases and paint cost a lot.</i>

654
00:46:36,628 --> 00:46:38,421
<i>To prepare painting materials,</i>

655
00:46:38,505 --> 00:46:41,466
<i>she delivered milk</i>
<i>when she wasn't even well,</i>

656
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:43,760
<i>and she even did piles of laundry</i>

657
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:46,304
<i>until her hands were all swollen.</i>

658
00:46:48,348 --> 00:46:50,683
<i>That year, when it snowed</i>
<i>an insane amount,</i>

659
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:53,144
<i>she went out to deliver milk</i>
<i>and never came back.</i>

660
00:46:53,228 --> 00:46:56,147
<i>So we went out to find her,</i>
<i>and that's what happened.</i>

661
00:46:58,024 --> 00:46:59,484
Aunt Myeong-shin, you have a visitor.

662
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:02,695
Are these all her paintings?

663
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:05,406
There's an unnecessary amount,
isn't there?

664
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:09,077
How were so many pieces painted
in such a short time?

665
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,995
Gosh, it was such an ordeal.

666
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:13,498
Pardon?

667
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,585
I mean,

668
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:20,255
she kept painting without eating properly.

669
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:22,006
So imagine what happened to her stomach.

670
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:23,591
Of course, it'd be an ordeal for her.

671
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:25,176
Right.

672
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,678
Would it or wouldn't it be an ordeal?

673
00:47:27,971 --> 00:47:29,013
It would. Yes.

674
00:47:40,817 --> 00:47:41,693
Sir.

675
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:43,987
I will purchase...

676
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:46,656
all these paintings.

677
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:49,993
My goodness. What for?

678
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:53,037
I can give you 100 million won.
How does it sound?

679
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:56,499
My goodness.

680
00:47:57,292 --> 00:48:00,128
Stop joking around.
Do you think I'm an idiot?

681
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:04,090
Then, I'll double it

682
00:48:04,173 --> 00:48:05,258
and give you 200 million.

683
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,680
Forget it.
I'll trade them for taffies later.

684
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,182
Then, ten million for each work.

685
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:14,976
I'll give you 300 million.

686
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:18,021
Three hundred million.

687
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:23,192
My goodness. Is this really happening?

688
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:25,695
Then, I will…

689
00:48:34,537 --> 00:48:36,205
How about three billion won, sir?

690
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:40,501
Three billion?

691
00:48:42,295 --> 00:48:44,130
Olivia, how did you find this place?

692
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:47,300
You left in a rush, so I tailed you.

693
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:50,470
Are these
all Cheon Myeong-shin's paintings?

694
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:53,097
Miss, did you just say three billion?

695
00:48:53,181 --> 00:48:54,682
Yes, three billion.

696
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:57,018
Three billion isn't much
for beautiful paintings like these.

697
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:59,270
Hold on, sir.

698
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:03,274
You can spend that much
without your company's approval?

699
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:06,152
I know it's Wonderby,
but don't they have procedures?

700
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:07,445
My, what a shame.

701
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,203
Mr. Choi? But why…

702
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:19,248
You told me to play in the big leagues.

703
00:49:19,332 --> 00:49:21,000
So I decided to make an investment.

704
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:21,918
Hello.

705
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:23,461
Who is this man now?

706
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:26,798
They say vices learned late in life
are the worst and you two just…

707
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:27,799
Hold on!

708
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:30,385
You just said three billion…

709
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:32,345
Three and a half billion!

710
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:33,429
Three and a half?

711
00:49:34,222 --> 00:49:37,308
Sir, calm down and listen to me.

712
00:49:37,392 --> 00:49:40,269
This person is just a buyer from abroad.

713
00:49:40,353 --> 00:49:42,313
She'll be sending all these precious works

714
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:43,940
-to foreign countries.
-What?

715
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:46,526
Sir, to this man,
paintings are just money.

716
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:48,861
You saw it yourself.
He offered only 100 million for all of…

717
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:50,405
Seriously, how shameless.

718
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:52,407
-Right. Earlier, he said…
-Damn it!

719
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:56,494
Olivia, you seriously
have it wrong right now.

720
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:59,288
But you're a buyer, not an appraiser.

721
00:49:59,372 --> 00:50:02,250
Turning an amateur painter
from the countryside into van Gogh.

722
00:50:02,709 --> 00:50:03,543
Only I,

723
00:50:04,836 --> 00:50:06,838
Mr. Famous can do that.

724
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:07,755
Got it?

725
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,718
Gosh, if you're that good,
why don't you be van Gogh yourself then?

726
00:50:12,427 --> 00:50:13,553
Sir.

727
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:15,179
Let me settle this for you.

728
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:17,473
I'll buy all
of Cheon Myeong-shin's precious works

729
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:21,644
for four billion won.

730
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:22,854
Four billion?

731
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,064
Four and a half billion.

732
00:50:25,148 --> 00:50:26,524
Four and a half billion!

733
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:28,151
-Five billion!
-Five…

734
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:30,486
For goodness' sake!

735
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:37,952
What a shame.

736
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:42,206
Yes, five billion.

737
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:46,043
Sold.

738
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:04,604
In today's auction,

739
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:06,856
we'll only feature the works
of an obscure painter

740
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:09,233
who hasn't been widely discovered yet.

741
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:13,279
This marks the birth of a new star
in the Korean art scene.

742
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:16,115
The late Cheon Myeong-shin

743
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:20,077
was a passionate artist
who poured her soul into painting

744
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:23,706
while battling illness
during the Japanese occupation period.

745
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:27,335
Her bold drawings and powerful strokes

746
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:32,882
capture her aching desire to live
in this masterpiece!

747
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:35,384
Hey, that's me.

748
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:40,097
What?

749
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:52,109
Please remain silent. Thank you.

750
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:54,278
I said I'm Cheon Myeong-shin.

751
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:56,322
I'm not a genius painter
who died at a young age.

752
00:51:56,405 --> 00:52:00,284
I'm a small business owner who runs
Cheonmyeongshin Shop by the beach.

753
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:04,121
I wasn't born in 1919. I was born in 1964,
the Year of the Dragon.

754
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:07,291
I am the mother

755
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:09,043
of Kim Bo-ra, my dear daughter.

756
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:11,128
Kim Bo-ra?

757
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:40,491
So, did you enjoy admiring my paintings?

758
00:52:41,576 --> 00:52:42,743
Your paintings?

759
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:44,620
These are all your works?

760
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:46,414
How?

761
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:51,961
We'll make her a real artist! A real one!

762
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:55,923
Then, the paintings will be real,
because they're done by a real artist.

763
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:58,384
-A real artist!
-A real artist!

764
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,973
Well, it wasn't your fault
you were bitten by a rabid dog.

765
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:07,018
But whether you fall apart like this

766
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:09,353
or get back on your feet

767
00:53:09,437 --> 00:53:11,397
is up to you.

768
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:16,944
Sleep on it.

769
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:27,872
78 DOKSIMNI, MUN-GU, SEOUL
ANTIQUE ART SHOP

770
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:36,255
Look here. Yes, very nice.

771
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:38,633
Let's see.

772
00:53:39,634 --> 00:53:41,928
-Pretty good, right?
-It's a really good picture.

773
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:43,721
All right.

774
00:53:49,852 --> 00:53:52,480
I was worried
just in case you'd recognize it.

775
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:57,944
I guess you really admired my talent.

776
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:02,740
I painted all of them, everyone.

777
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:07,078
-What's going on?
-He's a swindler!

778
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:08,245
So this was all a scam?

779
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:10,790
Historical moment, my foot.

780
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:13,250
What kind of trick
are you trying to pull on us?

781
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:15,711
That damn junkie must still be high.

782
00:54:15,795 --> 00:54:17,129
How dare she come in here?

783
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:19,840
Hey, you little…

784
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,638
How dare you lay your hand
on my precious daughter?

785
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:28,224
I'll cut it off
and turn it into radish kimchi!

786
00:54:30,977 --> 00:54:32,645
-What's that?
-My goodness!

787
00:54:36,399 --> 00:54:38,734
Are they painting forgeries?

788
00:54:39,402 --> 00:54:40,820
How is that possible?

789
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:42,488
What…

790
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:45,408
<i>Show me what?</i>

791
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:50,121
<i>Just get lost. Stop ruining my paintings.</i>

792
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:53,082
No.

793
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:54,375
No!

794
00:54:55,835 --> 00:54:57,211
What's going on?

795
00:54:58,337 --> 00:54:59,171
Oh my!

796
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:05,386
-What's he doing?
-My goodness.

797
00:55:08,264 --> 00:55:09,098
Oh, dear.

798
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:10,307
How pathetic.

799
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:16,397
No. This isn't true!

800
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:18,107
This was all fabricated.

801
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:19,734
It's a deepfake!

802
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:22,361
That's AI. That's not me!

803
00:55:22,445 --> 00:55:23,404
Mr. Famous.

804
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:24,697
You're Mr. Famous, right?

805
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:26,032
What now?

806
00:55:26,115 --> 00:55:27,158
We received a report.

807
00:55:28,034 --> 00:55:28,909
A report?

808
00:55:28,993 --> 00:55:31,370
You're under arrest
for abduction, confinement,

809
00:55:31,454 --> 00:55:33,789
blackmailing,
and the distribution and sale of drugs.

810
00:55:34,457 --> 00:55:37,585
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to an attorney.

811
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:40,212
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

812
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:44,133
Who are you to arrest me?
Who do you think you are?

813
00:55:44,216 --> 00:55:45,051
We can talk later.

814
00:55:45,134 --> 00:55:46,469
-I'm Mr. Famous.
-Take him.

815
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:48,929
I'm Mr. Famous. Don't you know who I am?

816
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:52,308
Hey! I'm Mr. Famous!

817
00:55:53,434 --> 00:55:55,352
Just you wait.

818
00:55:55,436 --> 00:55:56,687
You filthy little…

819
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:12,161
Gosh.

820
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:14,330
-Goodness.
-It smells amazing.

821
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:16,582
-Be careful.
-No, I got it. Call the kids.

822
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:20,503
Hey, come here!
The <i>ramyeon </i>will get soggy!

823
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:22,546
Guys, let's run! Let's go eat <i>ramyeon!</i>

824
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:26,509
I thought Gu-ho was just a clumsy guy
with a handsome face.

825
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:27,968
But he's actually pretty amazing.

826
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:30,554
I know. I see him in a new light now.

827
00:56:30,638 --> 00:56:32,389
How about him as husband material?

828
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:35,476
What are you talking about?

829
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:37,520
-What? He's not so bad.
-No.

830
00:56:38,229 --> 00:56:39,605
Is that really a no?

831
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:42,066
Absolutely not.

832
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:43,067
Really?

833
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,402
-Bon appetit!
-Bon appetit!

834
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:47,655
-You lost, so you can't eat.
-No, stop it.

835
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:48,697
No, I won.

836
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:50,866
We scored three goals.

837
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:52,868
-He's right.
-Right, you scored two.

838
00:56:52,952 --> 00:56:54,286
-And I scored one.
-No, we…

839
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:07,925
FAME WORK TRANSACTION LEDGER

840
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:13,973
YU KANG-IL, GHOST CASTLE

841
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:15,099
EMPTY TRASH

842
00:57:23,649 --> 00:57:26,402
DO NOT ENTER

843
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:32,671
{\an8}<i>We should've suspected it.</i>

844
01:00:32,755 --> 01:00:36,925
{\an8}We should've seen if he was
a real doctor or just a damn fraud.

845
01:00:37,426 --> 01:00:39,345
{\an8}<i>Are we supposed to let the kid die?</i>

846
01:00:39,428 --> 01:00:41,388
{\an8}You think we'll be the only ones
getting screwed?

847
01:00:41,472 --> 01:00:43,432
{\an8}She didn't die during surgery.
Isn't that enough?

848
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:46,894
{\an8}<i>If we got a good scene</i>
<i>for our hospital's promotional video,</i>

849
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:48,187
{\an8}<i>she's run out of use, you idiot.</i>

850
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:50,522
{\an8}How are we going to make them pay?

851
01:00:50,606 --> 01:00:54,735
{\an8}<i>Okay. The codename for this operation</i>
<i>will be "Eye and Tooth."</i>

852
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:56,320
{\an8}<i>An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.</i>

853
01:00:56,403 --> 01:01:00,449
{\an8}I'll make sure she experiences fire
and brimstone even in the dead of winter.
