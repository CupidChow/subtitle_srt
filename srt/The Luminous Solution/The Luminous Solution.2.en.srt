Just tell me.

but if your clinic opens,

190
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:33,912
we'll talk later.

191
00:20:36,118 --> 00:20:37,485
Okay.

192
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:40,821
Hey.

193
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,571
Aren't you going to work?

194
00:20:43,603 --> 00:20:44,680
It's going to be late.

195
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,133
I’m going to be late, too.

196
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:48,625
Oh.

197
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:50,680
That's right, then you go out first.

198
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:53,133
You'll be late because of me.

199
00:20:54,915 --> 00:20:55,915
Alright.

200
00:20:59,454 --> 00:21:00,654
Oh, by the way.

201
00:21:01,735 --> 00:21:04,368
Darin's birthday party is today.

202
00:21:05,383 --> 00:21:06,672
You didn't forget, right?

203
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:08,266
Of course.

204
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:10,836
Tell me which restaurant.

205
00:21:10,861 --> 00:21:12,657
I'll join you when I get off work.

206
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,610
Okay.

207
00:21:15,087 --> 00:21:16,687
You should go now.

208
00:21:16,969 --> 00:21:18,438
Go.

209
00:21:54,255 --> 00:21:57,270
(Kor Mor 4, Sena)

210
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:05,122
Hi.

211
00:22:06,364 --> 00:22:07,364
Hey.

212
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:32,249
Hey.

213
00:22:32,606 --> 00:22:33,646
Sit properly.

214
00:22:34,497 --> 00:22:35,754
You wanna start something?

215
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,333
No.

216
00:22:43,794 --> 00:22:45,234
Hey.

217
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:46,551
How much does your mom

218
00:22:46,576 --> 00:22:47,934
give you for school daily?

219
00:22:50,317 --> 00:22:51,317
100 baht.

220
00:22:53,786 --> 00:22:54,950
Let me see.

221
00:22:55,606 --> 00:22:56,629
Are you lying?

222
00:22:58,841 --> 00:23:00,041
Show it to me.

223
00:23:07,092 --> 00:23:08,309
Ya got a lot, man.

224
00:23:10,231 --> 00:23:11,271
Is it enough?

225
00:23:12,856 --> 00:23:13,856
Not enough?

226
00:23:16,638 --> 00:23:17,638
Well,

227
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:20,145
I feel like I really clicked with you.

228
00:23:20,997 --> 00:23:22,098
Have 20 more baht.

229
00:23:24,255 --> 00:23:25,325
That's 120 in total.

230
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,223
Go buy some snacks.

231
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,629
Brother, where's my 100 baht?

232
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,700
Hello.

233
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:54,725
Hello.

234
00:23:54,802 --> 00:23:56,410
Is this a Bangkhen Honda Car?

235
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,745
Yes, we are speaking.

236
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,129
I want to make a car paint appointment.

237
00:24:00,294 --> 00:24:01,864
License plate number, please.

238
00:24:01,889 --> 00:24:04,209

239
00:24:04,481 --> 00:24:06,207
Booker's name, please.

240
00:24:06,677 --> 00:24:09,067
The booker's name is Phathit.

241
00:24:09,426 --> 00:24:11,285
When will it be convenient for you?

242
00:24:11,395 --> 00:24:13,223
If it's tomorrow, is it possible?

243
00:24:13,325 --> 00:24:14,668
Yes, sure.

244
00:24:15,177 --> 00:24:16,535
Okay, see you tomorrow.

245
00:24:16,552 --> 00:24:18,051
Yes, thank you.

246
00:24:29,591 --> 00:24:30,965
Oh! Ryou, Nack!

247
00:24:32,481 --> 00:24:33,863
Why are you so late?

248
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:36,488
Nack, you did your homework

249
00:24:36,513 --> 00:24:37,753
at Ryou's house yesterday?

250
00:24:37,778 --> 00:24:38,778
Yep.

251
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:40,559
Come here, let me copy it,

252
00:24:40,584 --> 00:24:42,317
or I won't be able to submit it in time.

253
00:24:42,325 --> 00:24:43,325
Hey!

254
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,520
Hey!

255
00:24:45,809 --> 00:24:47,082
Are you still mad at me?

256
00:24:51,091 --> 00:24:52,575
What, I'm not mad at you.

257
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,152
I sent you a message yesterday.

258
00:24:57,239 --> 00:24:58,239
So?

259
00:24:58,802 --> 00:24:59,918
You've read it.

260
00:25:01,755 --> 00:25:02,755
So?

261
00:25:04,872 --> 00:25:06,840
That means you're still angry with me.

262
00:25:08,614 --> 00:25:09,934
No,

263
00:25:10,099 --> 00:25:11,239
I just don't care.

264
00:25:13,684 --> 00:25:14,884
You're that angry?

265
00:25:14,989 --> 00:25:15,989
What?

266
00:25:18,005 --> 00:25:19,692
Are you really that angry at me?

267
00:25:20,513 --> 00:25:21,520
Actually,

268
00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:23,957
I didn't even care.

269
00:25:42,503 --> 00:25:45,035
(PTG agency)

270
00:25:56,627 --> 00:25:59,643
(Panticha Pornsitthipokin 180k baht)

271
00:26:02,514 --> 00:26:03,928
How many months can we live

272
00:26:03,953 --> 00:26:05,240
with only this amount?

273
00:26:08,218 --> 00:26:10,670
(Thana Saengsubsiri 240k baht)

274
00:26:15,905 --> 00:26:17,425
Let's go eat.

275
00:26:49,263 --> 00:26:50,263
It's not delicious?

276
00:26:51,497 --> 00:26:52,497
It’s okay.

277
00:26:54,465 --> 00:26:56,059
But what?

278
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,457
The situation is not good right now.

279
00:27:05,044 --> 00:27:06,044
Wow.

280
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:09,239
I have no appetite.

281
00:27:09,263 --> 00:27:10,543
How can you eat?

282
00:27:12,513 --> 00:27:13,762
I'm hungry.

283
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,439
So, I have to eat.

284
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:17,121
Don't worry.

285
00:27:17,848 --> 00:27:20,887
You're lucky that you have
Phathit as your boyfriend.

286
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:22,801
Look at me.

287
00:27:23,191 --> 00:27:24,449
I don't have a boyfriend.

288
00:27:24,715 --> 00:27:26,231
This is all the money I have.

289
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:27,864
When it's all gone,

290
00:27:28,684 --> 00:27:29,903
I have to go home and

291
00:27:29,928 --> 00:27:31,746
be forced into an arranged marriage

292
00:27:31,771 --> 00:27:32,926
with Yut for sure.

293
00:27:33,598 --> 00:27:34,926
I feel sorry for you.

294
00:27:35,098 --> 00:27:37,504
Yes, your life is better than mine.

295
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:40,606
You don't have to stress about it.

296
00:27:41,153 --> 00:27:42,489
Eat up.

297
00:27:42,514 --> 00:27:43,634
If you don't,

298
00:27:44,348 --> 00:27:46,512
(Mom)
your body will become weak,

299
00:27:46,661 --> 00:27:48,200
and you'll feel disheartened.

300
00:27:56,388 --> 00:27:58,075
- Hello, Mom.
- Hello, Thana.

301
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,067
Son, when can you transfer me the money

302
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:01,410
I'll transfer it right now.

303
00:28:01,434 --> 00:28:03,082
- Really?
- I already received the money.

304
00:28:03,106 --> 00:28:04,528
Sorry to bother you.

305
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,920
Don’t worry.

306
00:28:06,013 --> 00:28:07,137
Thank you so much.

307
00:28:07,161 --> 00:28:08,028
Yes.

308
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:10,098
So I can finally pay them.

309
00:28:10,747 --> 00:28:11,747
Okay.

310
00:28:17,638 --> 00:28:18,770
Hold on,

311
00:28:18,841 --> 00:28:20,153
where are you going?

312
00:28:20,388 --> 00:28:21,918
Is there a bank close by?

313
00:28:23,427 --> 00:28:24,934
Around the corner, I guess.

314
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:26,926
Okay. I’ll get going.

315
00:28:28,513 --> 00:28:29,513
Hey.

316
00:28:29,802 --> 00:28:30,864
What about yours?

317
00:28:34,356 --> 00:28:35,556
How much is it, Auntie?

318
00:28:37,653 --> 00:28:39,348
Do you have any discount?

319
00:28:56,177 --> 00:28:57,785
Is there anything I can help?

320
00:29:01,763 --> 00:29:02,883
Pick that pen up.

321
00:29:08,911 --> 00:29:10,598
Write your name on the paper,

322
00:29:11,755 --> 00:29:12,755
that's it.

323
00:29:16,582 --> 00:29:19,089
I didn't help with this
project if it's like this.

324
00:29:21,198 --> 00:29:22,398
You’ve already helped.

325
00:29:25,409 --> 00:29:26,682
You’ve already ruined it.

326
00:29:29,628 --> 00:29:31,370
You always make me feel guilty.

327
00:29:32,402 --> 00:29:33,643
You should feel guilty.

328
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:37,190
I really feel guilty.

329
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,315
That's why I apologized.

330
00:29:46,644 --> 00:29:47,644
I'm sorry.

331
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:07,659
Where to place it?

332
00:30:42,457 --> 00:30:43,457
Thanks, man.

333
00:30:46,253 --> 00:30:48,284
Come on, I'll treat you to an ice cream.

334
00:30:50,324 --> 00:30:51,675
No, I don't want to eat.

335
00:30:52,449 --> 00:30:54,183
Come on, don't be considerate.

336
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:55,808
That's not it.

337
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:57,198
I just don't want to eat it.

338
00:30:59,574 --> 00:31:01,753
Why are you always so serious?

339
00:31:06,332 --> 00:31:07,839
What do you want me to do?

340
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:09,855
You punched me yesterday.

341
00:31:10,316 --> 00:31:12,456
Today, you're all smiley.

342
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:15,105
See?

343
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,190
You're still mad at me.

344
00:31:18,722 --> 00:31:20,612
I already apologized.

345
00:31:27,933 --> 00:31:29,487
I really feel guilty, you know?

346
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:44,017
Yes, I got it.

347
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,963
Let's make up, then.

348
00:31:50,338 --> 00:31:51,618
You're so silly.

349
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,392
But you're willing to pinky promise.

350
00:32:00,529 --> 00:32:01,799
Let's eat some ice cream.

351
00:32:01,815 --> 00:32:02,815
No.

352
00:32:03,471 --> 00:32:04,471
Mai!

353
00:32:10,705 --> 00:32:11,782
The coach wants you for

354
00:32:11,807 --> 00:32:13,049
the basketball practice.

355
00:32:14,158 --> 00:32:15,158
Sure.

356
00:32:16,213 --> 00:32:17,213
Go ahead.

357
00:32:17,238 --> 00:32:18,285
See you later.

358
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,675
- Hello, Mom.
- Hello.

359
00:32:34,878 --> 00:32:35,964
I already transferred it.

360
00:32:35,988 --> 00:32:37,276
Thanks a lot, son.

361
00:32:38,253 --> 00:32:39,635
Update your bankbook.

362
00:32:39,761 --> 00:32:41,120
Okay, I’ll go check soon.

363
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,252
Thank you so much.

364
00:32:42,277 --> 00:32:43,479
You’re welcome, Mom.

365
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:45,057
Do you have enough money?

366
00:32:46,526 --> 00:32:47,589
Geez,

367
00:32:47,614 --> 00:32:49,214
your son is awesome, right?

368
00:32:49,917 --> 00:32:51,440
What are you worried about?

369
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:53,995
Go and deal with your stuff.

370
00:32:54,277 --> 00:32:55,862
Call me if you need anything.

371
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:57,331
I know.

372
00:32:58,128 --> 00:32:59,331
I'm worried about you,

373
00:32:59,356 --> 00:33:00,870
take care of yourself.

374
00:33:02,495 --> 00:33:03,535
Alright, Mom.

375
00:33:04,745 --> 00:33:05,854
No problem.

376
00:33:06,027 --> 00:33:08,425
Come back and see me when you're free.

377
00:33:09,292 --> 00:33:10,510
Of course.

378
00:33:10,901 --> 00:33:12,237
That's all for now, Mom.

379
00:33:12,394 --> 00:33:13,557
I have to go to work.

380
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,445
Love you, Mom.

381
00:33:45,768 --> 00:33:46,862
Hey.

382
00:33:47,196 --> 00:33:48,507
Didn't you go to school?

383
00:33:57,818 --> 00:33:58,935
What about you?

384
00:33:59,233 --> 00:34:00,646
Why don't you go to work?

385
00:34:02,178 --> 00:34:04,263
Why aren't you answering my question?

386
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,622
Always asking me back.

387
00:34:10,273 --> 00:34:11,393
I quit my job.

388
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,125
I also quit school.

389
00:34:16,727 --> 00:34:17,843
Really?

390
00:34:18,938 --> 00:34:20,335
So, what now?

391
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,171
Looking for a new school?

392
00:34:24,516 --> 00:34:26,316
Yep, I'm currently...

393
00:34:27,211 --> 00:34:28,570
homeschooling for now.

394
00:34:28,695 --> 00:34:30,375
Homeschooling?

395
00:34:30,695 --> 00:34:31,975
Like, self-study?

396
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,062
Yes. Something like that.

397
00:34:36,578 --> 00:34:37,578
Oh and...

398
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:40,937
What about your friend?

399
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:43,364
My friend?

400
00:34:43,852 --> 00:34:44,852
Who?

401
00:34:45,148 --> 00:34:46,835
The one that you often walk with

402
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,980
at the condo.

403
00:34:52,922 --> 00:34:54,609
He doesn't have a lot of free time.

404
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:55,674
He's working.

405
00:35:00,344 --> 00:35:01,585
Are you guys a couple?

406
00:35:04,453 --> 00:35:05,453
Not telling.

407
00:35:06,656 --> 00:35:07,656
The heck…!

408
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:09,692
Why are you asking?

409
00:35:09,766 --> 00:35:11,046
Do you know him?

410
00:35:11,188 --> 00:35:12,188
No.

411
00:35:12,742 --> 00:35:13,984
Why did you ask, then?

412
00:35:18,261 --> 00:35:19,878
I see that you're always alone.

413
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,581
Must be lonely.

414
00:35:21,651 --> 00:35:22,870
Who's lonely?

415
00:35:23,511 --> 00:35:24,871
That's nonsense!

416
00:35:25,868 --> 00:35:26,868
What about you?

417
00:35:28,048 --> 00:35:29,399
You must be so lonely.

418
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,578
Sitting by the river alone like this.

419
00:35:33,313 --> 00:35:34,313
Not at all.

420
00:35:34,744 --> 00:35:36,392
I have games on my phone.

421
00:35:36,821 --> 00:35:37,961
I'm not lonely at all.

422
00:35:38,157 --> 00:35:39,157
Hey.

423
00:35:40,243 --> 00:35:41,290
It is not the same.

424
00:35:41,821 --> 00:35:42,821
How?

425
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:46,438
Do you know what loneliness is?

426
00:35:52,729 --> 00:35:54,024
Loneliness comes from

427
00:35:54,688 --> 00:35:56,336
being used to something.

428
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,297
We are lonely because we get used

429
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,000
to having someone next to us,

430
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,938
and one day when they're gone,

431
00:36:04,149 --> 00:36:05,235
it feels lonely.

432
00:36:10,345 --> 00:36:11,875
Seems like you understand it.

433
00:36:18,392 --> 00:36:20,266
Let's go find something to eat.

434
00:36:21,204 --> 00:36:22,540
No, I'm not hungry.

435
00:36:22,565 --> 00:36:24,602
Hey. Come on. Hurry.

436
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,360
Come on.

437
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,069
What are you listening to?

438
00:36:45,596 --> 00:36:46,796
Let me listen, too.

439
00:36:52,486 --> 00:36:53,486
Thank you.

440
00:36:56,135 --> 00:36:57,135
Oh.

441
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,440
Hello.

442
00:36:58,465 --> 00:37:00,486
How are you, Mai? Getting more familiar?

443
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:01,518
Yes.

444
00:37:02,152 --> 00:37:04,261
Thank you for taking care of him, Ryou.

445
00:37:05,542 --> 00:37:06,542
Yes.

446
00:37:16,482 --> 00:37:17,482
Thank you.

447
00:37:46,666 --> 00:37:48,181
The last work isn't even done,

448
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,330
here comes more work.

449
00:37:50,939 --> 00:37:52,751
Why are you complaining so much?

450
00:37:53,236 --> 00:37:54,837
You act like you already did it.

451
00:37:55,041 --> 00:37:56,993
We have Ryou, what are we afraid of?

452
00:37:57,883 --> 00:37:58,984
Are you serious?

453
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:00,751
Of course, you are smart!

454
00:38:02,134 --> 00:38:03,689
So, what’s the topic?

455
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,360
Anything. You decide, Ryou.

456
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:29,400
Hey, be careful!

457
00:38:31,549 --> 00:38:33,393
Mai, that was so sick!

458
00:38:34,651 --> 00:38:36,346
Just like the actor in the series,

459
00:38:37,042 --> 00:38:38,604
makes me want to be Ryou!

460
00:38:38,776 --> 00:38:40,385
Imagine, if a handsome guy

461
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:41,783
came to knock away a basketball

462
00:38:41,807 --> 00:38:43,088
for a lovely girl like me.

463
00:38:43,471 --> 00:38:44,869
It must be so romantic.

464
00:38:44,924 --> 00:38:46,044
So cool, Mai!

465
00:38:47,276 --> 00:38:48,276
So,

466
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,367
I’ll take the ecosystem

467
00:38:50,392 --> 00:38:51,666
in the community topic.

468
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:53,119
Let's have a meeting

469
00:38:53,144 --> 00:38:54,283
in school on Saturday.

470
00:38:55,275 --> 00:38:56,447
I'd better go.

471
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:01,739
Bye!

472
00:39:04,244 --> 00:39:11,423
(The Luminous Solution)

473
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:18,728
(The Luminous Solution)

474
00:39:19,338 --> 00:39:21,306
According to the external examination,

475
00:39:21,331 --> 00:39:23,368
there are no problems after the surgery.

476
00:39:23,393 --> 00:39:24,907
The wound closed well.

477
00:39:25,048 --> 00:39:27,548
I'd like you to rest sufficiently,

478
00:39:27,704 --> 00:39:29,274
take medication as prescribed,

479
00:39:29,299 --> 00:39:30,579
and don't rush to use it.

480
00:39:31,189 --> 00:39:32,279
Thank you, Doctor.

481
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:33,943
Anyway, I'd like to thank you

482
00:39:33,968 --> 00:39:36,045
the other doctor who operated on me.

483
00:39:36,077 --> 00:39:37,077
Certainly.

484
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,100
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

485
00:39:38,732 --> 00:39:39,819
This way, please.

486
00:40:04,175 --> 00:40:05,916
(Eight missed calls from Thana)

487
00:40:05,968 --> 00:40:08,201
(Two missed calls from Darin)

488
00:40:10,938 --> 00:40:12,531
Today's cases are over.

489
00:40:13,317 --> 00:40:14,543
You can take a break.

490
00:40:14,772 --> 00:40:16,052
Thank you.

491
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:40,193
Let's have a look.

492
00:41:03,303 --> 00:41:04,303
Hey.

493
00:41:05,022 --> 00:41:06,685
Stick your tongue out like this.

494
00:41:08,326 --> 00:41:09,334
Why?

495
00:41:09,668 --> 00:41:10,840
It helps with spiciness?

496
00:41:10,943 --> 00:41:11,983
Nope.

497
00:41:13,186 --> 00:41:14,951
Why did you tell me to do it, then?

498
00:41:15,568 --> 00:41:16,568
It’s funny.

499
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,435
Jerk.

500
00:41:21,186 --> 00:41:22,341
Drinking water won't

501
00:41:22,366 --> 00:41:23,498
help with spiciness.

502
00:41:26,631 --> 00:41:27,834
I think it's easier

503
00:41:27,859 --> 00:41:29,130
to stop eating meatballs.

504
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:32,277
You have to eat meatballs with

505
00:41:32,302 --> 00:41:34,169
and vegetables so it won't be spicy.

506
00:41:35,357 --> 00:41:36,490
I don't believe you.

507
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:38,521
You will fool me again.

508
00:41:39,364 --> 00:41:40,927
Aww, Big Bro.

509
00:41:41,389 --> 00:41:42,880
Giving up so easily.

510
00:41:42,943 --> 00:41:44,223
You're no fun.

511
00:41:44,943 --> 00:41:46,052
You want me

512
00:41:46,826 --> 00:41:48,248
to fight the spiciness?

513
00:41:48,279 --> 00:41:49,279
Exactly!

514
00:43:24,252 --> 00:43:25,932
Are you done with work?

515
00:43:26,408 --> 00:43:27,955
Let me go grab the cake first.

516
00:43:28,174 --> 00:43:29,837
Do you want me to pick you up?

517
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:31,564
Grab the cake?

518
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:34,705
Yep, a cake.

519
00:43:35,954 --> 00:43:37,462
You haven't forgotten, right?

520
00:43:38,166 --> 00:43:39,251
I haven't forgotten.

521
00:43:40,603 --> 00:43:42,337
See you at the restaurant, then.

522
00:43:43,024 --> 00:43:44,314
So you don't drive back.

523
00:43:45,549 --> 00:43:47,306
Okay. See you, then.

524
00:44:01,768 --> 00:44:02,768
Today,

525
00:44:04,182 --> 00:44:05,222
thanks a lot.

526
00:44:05,869 --> 00:44:07,298
You want hang out again tomorrow?

527
00:44:07,323 --> 00:44:08,323
Tomorrow?

528
00:44:08,932 --> 00:44:10,978
Well... You're not doing anything.

529
00:44:11,151 --> 00:44:12,377
I feel like hanging out

530
00:44:12,402 --> 00:44:13,768
to shake off this boredom.

531
00:44:15,503 --> 00:44:16,503
See ya.

532
00:44:22,955 --> 00:44:24,002
Today is so fun.

533
00:44:24,373 --> 00:44:25,810
- The coach was tough.
- Today, I shot

534
00:44:26,354 --> 00:44:27,940
like professional!

535
00:44:33,615 --> 00:44:35,310
Where's Nack rushing off to?

536
00:44:35,818 --> 00:44:38,044
He must hurry back to his home, idiot.

537
00:44:38,654 --> 00:44:40,857
And you're so smart, huh?

538
00:44:40,882 --> 00:44:42,036
Of course,

539
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:43,997
my brain is brilliant.

540
00:44:44,506 --> 00:44:46,318
Well, I’ve got to go now.

541
00:44:46,443 --> 00:44:47,669
See you, man.

542
00:44:47,864 --> 00:44:48,864
See you.

543
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:02,833
Yes, I know.

544
00:45:03,545 --> 00:45:05,802
But you must learn to do it yourself,

545
00:45:05,959 --> 00:45:07,161
don't just rely on me.

546
00:45:07,381 --> 00:45:08,825
Because I can't do it,

547
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,247
so I want you to teach me.

548
00:45:10,263 --> 00:45:11,888
Yeah, fine.

549
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,240
Then, I'll see you.

550
00:45:14,708 --> 00:45:15,708
Okay, see you.

551
00:45:16,036 --> 00:45:17,156
Okay, see you.

552
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,146
(Happy birthday Darin)

553
00:45:23,171 --> 00:45:25,716
Cheers! Move it here.

554
00:45:25,741 --> 00:45:26,741
Can you reach it?

555
00:45:28,553 --> 00:45:29,553
Hey.

556
00:45:33,952 --> 00:45:35,072
Wait a moment.

557
00:45:38,857 --> 00:45:39,928
How are you today?

558
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,160
Are you tired?

559
00:45:42,131 --> 00:45:43,467
Not at all.

560
00:45:43,546 --> 00:45:44,725
I took a motorbike.

561
00:45:46,241 --> 00:45:48,240
So, are you hungry?

562
00:45:48,467 --> 00:45:49,865
Have you eaten anything?

563
00:45:50,178 --> 00:45:51,698
I ate a little bit.

564
00:45:53,262 --> 00:45:54,623
Then, let’s go.

565
00:45:55,147 --> 00:45:56,147
Come on.

566
00:45:57,475 --> 00:45:59,928
Oh, here comes the hero.

567
00:46:00,116 --> 00:46:01,365
Come and sit, Thana.

568
00:46:02,014 --> 00:46:03,334
Always late.

569
00:46:03,819 --> 00:46:04,928
Happy birthday.

570
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,108
Wow, you are beautiful today!

571
00:46:07,928 --> 00:46:09,076
You're exaggerating.

572
00:46:09,889 --> 00:46:11,076
Excuse me,

573
00:46:11,662 --> 00:46:12,873
Can I have a glass and

574
00:46:12,898 --> 00:46:14,295
a plate for this guy, please.

575
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:16,162
Are you hungry?

576
00:46:16,654 --> 00:46:17,654
Not really.

577
00:46:18,155 --> 00:46:19,264
Not really?

578
00:46:25,108 --> 00:46:26,365
Come on, Let’s cheers.

579
00:46:26,522 --> 00:46:27,722
- We're all here.
- Sure.

580
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:30,162
Cheers!

581
00:46:46,176 --> 00:46:48,191
Lightweight as always.

582
00:46:51,691 --> 00:46:53,027
Probably tired of working.

583
00:46:55,309 --> 00:46:56,669
He's very talented.

584
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,933
He is so successful when he's so young.

585
00:47:00,762 --> 00:47:01,824
Whoever gets to be

586
00:47:01,849 --> 00:47:03,152
his boyfriend is so lucky.

587
00:47:04,129 --> 00:47:05,129
How?

588
00:47:06,426 --> 00:47:08,425
Well... Lucky for dating him.

589
00:47:09,192 --> 00:47:10,480
Anyone would be proud.

590
00:47:11,231 --> 00:47:12,246
That's true.

591
00:47:12,254 --> 00:47:13,754
If I'm his boyfriend,

592
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:15,793
I would be so proud.

593
00:47:16,293 --> 00:47:17,519
I would stay at home

594
00:47:17,895 --> 00:47:20,433
and only fool around not working.

595
00:47:22,574 --> 00:47:23,816
What about you,

596
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:24,980
how's your job?

597
00:47:25,043 --> 00:47:26,433
You'd better quit your job

598
00:47:26,458 --> 00:47:28,269
- to help Phathit work.
- Hey.

599
00:47:29,777 --> 00:47:31,105
How could you ask that?

600
00:47:31,871 --> 00:47:32,879
That’s our friend.

601
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:35,140
If it were me...

602
00:47:38,692 --> 00:47:39,812
I can't do it.

603
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,785
I'd rather stay at home.

604
00:47:43,348 --> 00:47:45,548
What are you guys talking about?

605
00:47:45,902 --> 00:47:47,933
It's a matter between those two.

606
00:47:48,339 --> 00:47:50,058
It's not your guy's business.

607
00:47:50,996 --> 00:47:53,300
What? We're just joking like friends do.

608
00:47:53,418 --> 00:47:54,636
Yeah, that's right.

609
00:47:54,957 --> 00:47:56,207
We're just teasing him.

610
00:47:56,629 --> 00:47:59,121
Thana isn't as upset as you are.

611
00:47:59,363 --> 00:48:00,746
Why are you complaining?

612
00:48:00,762 --> 00:48:02,105
Oh, I'm in the wrong?

613
00:48:04,621 --> 00:48:06,152
So let me ask you a question,

614
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:08,484
it's a matter between the two of us,

615
00:48:09,434 --> 00:48:10,863
why do you seem troubled?

616
00:48:12,415 --> 00:48:13,532
Take it easy, man.

617
00:48:15,049 --> 00:48:16,251
Aren't they just drunk?

618
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,689
It's okay to be foul-mouthed

619
00:48:17,714 --> 00:48:18,767
when you're drunk?

620
00:48:19,197 --> 00:48:20,557
Thana,

621
00:48:20,582 --> 00:48:21,582
calm down.

622
00:48:22,955 --> 00:48:23,995
To be honest,

623
00:48:24,939 --> 00:48:27,650
I'm just speaking based on what I see.

624
00:48:29,509 --> 00:48:30,993
Who's leeching off his partner here?

625
00:48:31,018 --> 00:48:32,018
Shut it!

626
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,119
Calm down.

627
00:48:36,252 --> 00:48:37,822
- Enough.
- You don't have to poke me.

628
00:48:37,955 --> 00:48:38,955
Seriously,

629
00:48:39,689 --> 00:48:40,892
why can't I say it?

630
00:48:41,947 --> 00:48:42,947
We know,

631
00:48:42,971 --> 00:48:44,158
everyone here knows,

632
00:48:44,891 --> 00:48:46,469
that you're leeching off of him.

633
00:48:46,494 --> 00:48:48,455
Not to mention that condo of yours.

634
00:48:48,471 --> 00:48:49,471
Seriously,

635
00:48:50,635 --> 00:48:52,095
do you even own anything?

636
00:49:08,978 --> 00:49:11,119
Hey, where are you guys going?

637
00:49:13,041 --> 00:49:14,072
What's with him?

638
00:49:18,446 --> 00:49:20,246
What's wrong with you guys?

639
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:22,461
You think you can say anything

640
00:49:22,486 --> 00:49:23,594
when you're drunk?

641
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,133
Dang. Are you alright?

642
00:49:38,891 --> 00:49:40,789
Come on, I'll open the door for you.

643
00:50:00,095 --> 00:50:01,634
Naphat is drunk.

644
00:50:01,796 --> 00:50:03,063
Don't mind him.

645
00:50:05,337 --> 00:50:06,665
He was rude, regardless.

646
00:50:07,243 --> 00:50:08,876
Why does he hate me that much?

647
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,274
He doesn't hate you.

648
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:12,649
But you know the reason.

649
00:50:16,739 --> 00:50:18,395
So, I have to be understanding?

650
00:50:18,653 --> 00:50:20,166
We already became a couple

651
00:50:20,191 --> 00:50:22,059
and live together now.

652
00:50:23,036 --> 00:50:24,199
If he's not okay,

653
00:50:25,027 --> 00:50:26,324
he should deal with it.

654
00:50:26,981 --> 00:50:28,191
Just forget it.

655
00:50:28,378 --> 00:50:31,575
You won't see each other often anyway.

656
00:50:31,809 --> 00:50:33,488
Well, just let it be.

657
00:50:34,106 --> 00:50:35,106
Okay?

658
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,355
Thank you for protecting me.

659
00:50:39,238 --> 00:50:40,285
Don't mention it.

660
00:50:40,395 --> 00:50:42,195
You can drive back, right?

661
00:50:42,926 --> 00:50:44,027
Yes, I can.

662
00:50:44,052 --> 00:50:45,254
I didn't even drink.

663
00:50:45,481 --> 00:50:47,910
Great, then drive home safely.

664
00:50:48,997 --> 00:50:51,316
Are you returning to the party? Or...

665
00:50:52,161 --> 00:50:53,535
Want me to drive you home?

666
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:54,902
No, I'll go back inside and

667
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:56,512
take care of them first.

668
00:50:57,911 --> 00:50:59,215
Go on already.

669
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,629
- Drive safely, dude.
- Okay.

670
00:51:10,958 --> 00:51:11,958
Bye!

671
00:51:20,634 --> 00:51:23,477
(Bualoy and sweet egg dessert)

672
00:51:25,704 --> 00:51:26,868
Excuse me,

673
00:51:26,893 --> 00:51:28,532
could we have the bill, please?

674
00:51:29,313 --> 00:51:30,821
20 baht.

675
00:51:30,846 --> 00:51:32,286
It's so delicious.

676
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:41,816
Are you hiding from me?

677
00:51:43,223 --> 00:51:44,223
Says who?

678
00:51:44,527 --> 00:51:45,995
I was looking for something.

679
00:51:48,293 --> 00:51:49,378
Where is it?

680
00:51:49,387 --> 00:51:50,683
Have you found it?

681
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:54,644
That’s none of your concern.

682
00:51:56,729 --> 00:51:58,674
Eating sweets at night, you'll get fat.

683
00:51:59,205 --> 00:52:00,221
So what?

684
00:52:00,245 --> 00:52:02,010
Someone still likes me anyway.

685
00:52:03,542 --> 00:52:04,690
What are you eating?

686
00:52:11,743 --> 00:52:13,704
Excuse me, can I have one of this?

687
00:52:15,348 --> 00:52:17,114
Why did you order just like me?

688
00:52:17,568 --> 00:52:18,786
Oh, why can't I?

689
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,364
So someone will like me as well,

690
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:22,771
can't I?

691
00:52:24,951 --> 00:52:25,951
Thank you.

692
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:45,032
Can I have some?

693
00:52:46,954 --> 00:52:48,360
Can I have some water?

694
00:53:07,134 --> 00:53:08,134
Take mine.

695
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,040
You go ahead.

696
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:15,125
Eat lots so you'll be liked by many.

697
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,440
Babe.

698
00:53:30,034 --> 00:53:31,034
We’re home.

699
00:53:43,761 --> 00:53:44,761
Babe.

700
00:53:46,034 --> 00:53:47,838
Wake up and go sleep in our room.

701
00:53:58,808 --> 00:54:00,292
I’m awake now.

702
00:54:03,973 --> 00:54:04,980
Are you alright?

703
00:54:07,183 --> 00:54:08,463
I'm fine.

704
00:54:09,331 --> 00:54:10,386
What about you?

705
00:54:10,621 --> 00:54:11,628
Are you alright?

706
00:54:12,629 --> 00:54:13,749
I'm totally fine.

707
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:16,238
I barely drank.

708
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:18,566
I did not mean that.

709
00:54:19,793 --> 00:54:20,793
I meant,

710
00:54:21,793 --> 00:54:22,894
can you carry me?

711
00:54:26,524 --> 00:54:27,524
Of course.

712
00:54:47,073 --> 00:54:48,073
Babe.

713
00:54:49,807 --> 00:54:50,807
Yes?

714
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:56,486
Can we make love?

715
00:55:00,253 --> 00:55:01,253
Here?

716
00:55:04,049 --> 00:55:05,169
That's weird.

717
00:55:08,573 --> 00:55:09,573
Why?

718
00:55:12,034 --> 00:55:13,034
Normally,

719
00:55:14,221 --> 00:55:15,799
you wouldn't do such thing.

720
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,240
What happened?

721
00:55:19,956 --> 00:55:21,636
Nothing...

722
00:55:23,354 --> 00:55:24,634
I just want to try it.

723
00:55:47,271 --> 00:55:49,232
Do you think that vendor will survive?

724
00:55:49,404 --> 00:55:50,591
I don't know

725
00:55:50,616 --> 00:55:52,825
but I'm not going back there anymore.

726
00:55:54,693 --> 00:55:55,950
Why didn't you tell me

727
00:55:55,975 --> 00:55:57,146
that it wasn't good?

728
00:55:57,381 --> 00:55:58,724
You suddenly showed up

729
00:55:58,749 --> 00:55:59,949
and ordered it,

730
00:56:00,959 --> 00:56:02,357
I didn't want to interrupt.

731
00:56:04,935 --> 00:56:06,021
You said that

732
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,068
people will like me if I eat it.

733
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:09,310
And you fell for it.

734
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:11,669
Do you want someone

735
00:56:11,694 --> 00:56:13,029
to like you that much?

736
00:56:13,107 --> 00:56:14,169
No.

737
00:56:14,592 --> 00:56:15,810
But what about you?

738
00:56:16,178 --> 00:56:17,240
Why are you so sure

739
00:56:17,265 --> 00:56:18,537
that someone likes you?

740
00:56:20,529 --> 00:56:21,622
I was just babbling.

741
00:56:22,568 --> 00:56:24,357
Who would like someone like me?

742
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:33,575
(THE CROWN)

743
00:56:39,943 --> 00:56:41,911
(THE CROWN)

744
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:49,470
Ryou!

745
00:56:51,133 --> 00:56:52,837
What's the matter? Why so quiet?

746
00:56:53,892 --> 00:56:54,892
You don't...

747
00:56:56,337 --> 00:56:57,509
Did you see a ghost?

748
00:57:15,903 --> 00:57:22,810
(The Luminous Solution)

749
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:30,427
(The Luminous Solution)

750
00:57:33,474 --> 00:57:34,512
Is this your dorm?

751
00:57:35,872 --> 00:57:36,872
Yeah.

752
00:57:37,966 --> 00:57:39,239
Why did you follow me?

753
00:57:39,434 --> 00:57:40,698
Why don't you go home?

754
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:42,372
Your house is on the other side.

755
00:57:43,005 --> 00:57:44,278
Just walking you home.

756
00:57:44,942 --> 00:57:46,004
Walking me home?

757
00:57:47,153 --> 00:57:48,153
Why?

758
00:57:49,984 --> 00:57:50,984
I'm just worried.

759
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:54,514
If you were to see a ghost again,

760
00:57:54,539 --> 00:57:55,992
the ghost would pee itself

761
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,120
and get a fever.

762
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:59,149
The ghost would pee itself?

763
00:57:59,587 --> 00:58:01,267
I'm the one who'll pee myself.

764
00:58:03,273 --> 00:58:04,593
Are you scared of ghosts?

765
00:58:12,063 --> 00:58:13,132
So you live alone?

766
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:14,484
What about your parents?

767
00:58:16,516 --> 00:58:17,570
Yeah, I live alone.

768
00:58:18,883 --> 00:58:20,375
I have an uncle and aunt,

769
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,900
but we don't live together.

770
00:58:22,336 --> 00:58:23,773
They sent me here to study.

771
00:58:24,664 --> 00:58:25,664
So cool!

772
00:58:26,117 --> 00:58:27,648
You know how to live alone.

773
00:58:27,797 --> 00:58:28,797
How?

774
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:30,546
The fact that you can live alone.

775
00:58:30,765 --> 00:58:31,906
If it's me,

776
00:58:31,931 --> 00:58:32,931
I can't live alone.

777
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:34,694
Why?

778
00:58:34,898 --> 00:58:36,226
Are you afraid of ghosts?

779
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:39,218
Ghosts do not scare me.

780
00:58:40,297 --> 00:58:41,609
What are you scared of?

781
00:58:42,155 --> 00:58:43,624
Just afraid of being lonely.

782
00:58:43,945 --> 00:58:45,225
Are you lonely?

783
00:58:46,984 --> 00:58:48,335
No.

784
00:58:48,875 --> 00:58:49,937
Dena and Nack come

785
00:58:49,962 --> 00:58:51,257
to sleep over sometimes.

786
00:58:59,172 --> 00:59:00,172
It's Nack.

787
00:59:01,777 --> 00:59:03,027
I'd better go, then.

788
00:59:03,349 --> 00:59:05,574
There's nothing to worry about now.

789
00:59:06,683 --> 00:59:07,683
Go.

790
00:59:12,019 --> 00:59:13,050
Mai!

791
00:59:13,854 --> 00:59:15,105
I'm not afraid of ghosts.

792
00:59:16,746 --> 00:59:17,786
I'm serious.

793
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:19,245
Yes, I know.

794
00:59:43,149 --> 00:59:44,149
Today...

795
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:47,992
I look terrible, right?

796
00:59:51,055 --> 00:59:52,125
Not at all.

797
00:59:52,539 --> 00:59:53,819
Same as always.

798
00:59:55,305 --> 00:59:56,515
So, that means

799
00:59:57,282 --> 00:59:58,476
it's very bad, then.

800
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:05,672
Not now.

801
01:00:05,875 --> 01:00:07,492
I haven't yet brushed my teeth.

802
01:00:08,672 --> 01:00:10,272
It does not matter.

803
01:00:18,382 --> 01:00:19,647
So,

804
01:00:20,046 --> 01:00:22,100
what are these marks on me?

805
01:00:27,085 --> 01:00:28,593
I didn't see any

806
01:00:29,577 --> 01:00:31,046
complaints about it last night.

807
01:00:35,889 --> 01:00:36,982
I know you

808
01:00:37,779 --> 01:00:39,623
don't want anyone to see the marks

809
01:00:39,648 --> 01:00:40,888
outside of your clothes.

810
01:00:48,709 --> 01:00:49,709
So...

811
01:00:51,407 --> 01:00:52,578
Where are you going?

812
01:00:53,188 --> 01:00:54,188
Work?

813
01:00:55,008 --> 01:00:56,008
Yes,

814
01:00:56,289 --> 01:00:57,289
Why?

815
01:00:58,173 --> 01:00:59,329
It's Saturday, isn't it?

816
01:01:02,142 --> 01:01:03,391
Noch asked me for help.

817
01:01:03,845 --> 01:01:05,118
The work is quite urgent

818
01:01:05,143 --> 01:01:06,954
and I want to work on my stuff.

819
01:01:08,922 --> 01:01:10,171
Alright.

820
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:12,001
Then...

821
01:01:13,743 --> 01:01:15,000
Concentrate your work.

822
01:01:15,149 --> 01:01:16,149
Okay.

823
01:01:40,764 --> 01:01:42,069
It's Phathit.

824
01:01:42,094 --> 01:01:43,803
I’ve reserved

825
01:01:44,366 --> 01:01:45,490
a car today.

826
01:01:47,608 --> 01:01:48,725
Can I

827
01:01:49,108 --> 01:01:51,131
postpone it for later?

828
01:01:55,913 --> 01:01:57,193
Oh...

829
01:01:58,225 --> 01:01:59,748
that's okay, then.

830
01:02:00,053 --> 01:02:01,100
I will

831
01:02:01,795 --> 01:02:02,795
be.

832
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,022
There today.

833
01:02:07,131 --> 01:02:08,131
Thank you.

834
01:03:33,348 --> 01:03:34,434
What is this, uncle?

835
01:03:34,872 --> 01:03:35,934
You're late because

836
01:03:35,959 --> 01:03:37,129
you were dressing up?

837
01:03:37,154 --> 01:03:39,621
Is this how you dress to go to work?

838
01:03:41,668 --> 01:03:43,855
Please call me brother.

839
01:03:45,723 --> 01:03:46,637
Here.

840
01:03:46,662 --> 01:03:47,662
Let's go.

841
01:04:00,841 --> 01:04:02,809
Ryou, Nack, come quickly,

842
01:04:02,974 --> 01:04:04,014
put it here.

843
01:04:05,248 --> 01:04:06,368
Place it here.

844
01:04:11,146 --> 01:04:12,146
Alright.

845
01:04:12,794 --> 01:04:14,474
You and you.

846
01:04:14,904 --> 01:04:16,630
Let's go collect a sample of water.

847
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:18,505
And you...

848
01:04:19,896 --> 01:04:20,981
arrange things here.

849
01:04:22,482 --> 01:04:23,700
Here's yours.

850
01:04:25,748 --> 01:04:26,841
You come with me.

851
01:04:26,873 --> 01:04:27,873
Thanks.

852
01:04:28,302 --> 01:04:29,302
Let's go.

853
01:05:38,358 --> 01:05:39,358
Ryou,

854
01:05:39,530 --> 01:05:40,741
be careful,

855
01:05:40,774 --> 01:05:41,774
it's scared.

856
01:05:42,843 --> 01:05:43,843
Yeah.

857
01:05:49,616 --> 01:05:50,616
Come here.

858
01:05:50,898 --> 01:05:51,898
Come here.

859
01:05:59,015 --> 01:06:00,015
Ouch!

860
01:06:02,827 --> 01:06:03,850
Ryou?

861
01:06:05,085 --> 01:06:06,342
What happened?

862
01:06:07,108 --> 01:06:08,811
The cat in the net scratched him.

863
01:06:11,381 --> 01:06:12,693
Let's go treat the wound.

864
01:06:12,779 --> 01:06:15,138
It's okay, just a scratch.

865
01:06:15,263 --> 01:06:17,599
No, It was a feral cat.

866
01:06:18,187 --> 01:06:20,171
You should get a tetanus vaccine first.

867
01:06:21,341 --> 01:06:22,458
Want me to come along?

868
01:06:22,483 --> 01:06:24,654
No, you stay and pack things here.

869
01:06:27,428 --> 01:06:28,548
Get well soon.

870
01:06:30,263 --> 01:06:31,716
Let's take a break and

871
01:06:32,224 --> 01:06:34,121
then we'll return the stuff to school.

872
01:06:34,545 --> 01:06:35,545
Sure.

873
01:06:44,242 --> 01:06:45,359
You always

874
01:06:45,384 --> 01:06:46,979
go out for a ride all the time?

875
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:48,952
Geez, you came here

876
01:06:48,977 --> 01:06:50,444
to talk about boring things?

877
01:06:53,703 --> 01:06:54,903
I was just asking.

878
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:57,580
You're always out.

879
01:06:57,803 --> 01:06:59,609
Your parents are alright with that?

880
01:07:01,383 --> 01:07:02,423
I live alone.

881
01:07:09,556 --> 01:07:11,165
My parents live in the country.

882
01:07:12,479 --> 01:07:13,783
I had a fight

883
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:15,299
at my old school,

884
01:07:16,471 --> 01:07:18,104
so I came out to study at home,

885
01:07:18,487 --> 01:07:20,322
but my mom wasn't happy about it.

886
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,509
So I separated to live on my own.

887
01:07:23,346 --> 01:07:24,432
Whoa.

888
01:07:26,228 --> 01:07:27,508
You're so brave.

889
01:07:33,813 --> 01:07:34,844
How?

890
01:07:34,883 --> 01:07:36,101
You have only one life.

891
01:07:36,328 --> 01:07:38,008
Live however you like.

892
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:50,154
The guy asked me about yesterday,

893
01:07:51,952 --> 01:07:53,357
he's actually my boyfriend.

894
01:07:55,301 --> 01:07:56,301
I knew that.

895
01:07:59,074 --> 01:08:00,074
You do?

896
01:08:01,816 --> 01:08:02,855
Why?

897
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:04,956
Do you want to go out with me?

898
01:08:07,004 --> 01:08:08,230
You little...

899
01:08:15,772 --> 01:08:16,772
I am...

900
01:08:18,725 --> 01:08:19,733
completely useless.

901
01:08:21,241 --> 01:08:22,529
My patience is low.

902
01:08:24,186 --> 01:08:25,386
Such a loser.

903
01:08:27,874 --> 01:08:29,522
I still haven't told my boyfriend

904
01:08:30,213 --> 01:08:31,330
that I quit my job.

905
01:08:32,264 --> 01:08:33,654
And I had to pretend.

906
01:08:34,108 --> 01:08:35,170
I was still working.

907
01:08:36,397 --> 01:08:37,522
It's so embarrassing.

908
01:08:43,318 --> 01:08:45,652
It's okay,

909
01:08:46,748 --> 01:08:48,006
I'll help you find a job.

910
01:08:51,041 --> 01:08:52,806
Huh? A kid like you will help me?

911
01:08:52,939 --> 01:08:54,299
That's hilarious.

912
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:55,660
What?

913
01:08:55,962 --> 01:08:57,329
Being called a kid again.

914
01:08:58,119 --> 01:09:00,056
Am I not judged enough?

915
01:09:12,075 --> 01:09:13,075
So...

916
01:09:13,355 --> 01:09:15,121
Why did you move to this school?

917
01:09:17,192 --> 01:09:18,660
I got an athletic scholarship.

918
01:09:18,747 --> 01:09:19,762
Among the offers,

919
01:09:19,787 --> 01:09:20,973
this is the best choice.

920
01:09:21,879 --> 01:09:23,964
There will also be dorms in the future.

921
01:09:24,957 --> 01:09:26,230
Don’t you live at home?

922
01:09:27,207 --> 01:09:28,301
I do.

923
01:09:28,848 --> 01:09:30,184
But my parents are moving

924
01:09:30,209 --> 01:09:31,309
to other provinces.

925
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:32,334
Why?

926
01:09:34,192 --> 01:09:35,996
They complained about money.

927
01:09:37,004 --> 01:09:38,426
I really don't want to know.

928
01:09:42,498 --> 01:09:43,795
I understand.

929
01:09:44,599 --> 01:09:45,990
You don't have to worry.

930
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:47,552
Ryou's been living alone

931
01:09:47,577 --> 01:09:48,841
since elementary school.

932
01:09:50,006 --> 01:09:52,473
If you feel lonely, you can call me.

933
01:09:52,623 --> 01:09:55,138
I'll run to at your dorm, okay?

934
01:09:55,193 --> 01:09:56,633
Let's have a party.

935
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:58,263
Sure.

936
01:09:58,287 --> 01:09:59,287
Yeah.

937
01:10:00,063 --> 01:10:01,265
Don't think too much.

938
01:10:09,727 --> 01:10:10,922
Here is your medicine.

939
01:10:10,992 --> 01:10:12,649
Take your medicine on time.

940
01:10:12,821 --> 01:10:13,821
Thank you.

941
01:10:19,561 --> 01:10:21,170
Are you okay, Ryou?

942
01:10:21,608 --> 01:10:22,685
It was just a scratch.

943
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:24,740
I cleaned the wound and got a vaccine,

944
01:10:24,748 --> 01:10:25,948
it'll be fine.

945
01:10:27,264 --> 01:10:28,599
I'm worried about you.

946
01:10:30,196 --> 01:10:31,474
I know,

947
01:10:31,741 --> 01:10:33,764
then shall we go help those two?

948
01:10:33,975 --> 01:10:35,224
They're done

949
01:10:35,249 --> 01:10:37,146
and they've taken our work to school.

950
01:10:38,358 --> 01:10:39,358
Then...

951
01:10:40,256 --> 01:10:41,818
can you drive me to the dorm?

952
01:10:42,584 --> 01:10:43,584
Sure.

953
01:10:43,609 --> 01:10:44,889
Are you hungry?

954
01:10:45,342 --> 01:10:47,224
Want to grab something before that?

955
01:10:47,467 --> 01:10:50,201
No, I'd like to sleep more.

956
01:10:50,311 --> 01:10:51,951
Are you hungry?

957
01:10:52,303 --> 01:10:53,428
I'm not hungry.

958
01:10:53,459 --> 01:10:55,045
I'll get the car to pick you up.

959
01:10:55,248 --> 01:10:56,248
Hey.

960
01:10:56,475 --> 01:10:57,865
I can walk by myself.

961
01:10:57,890 --> 01:10:59,326
Let's go together. I'm okay.

962
01:11:08,702 --> 01:11:10,530
(Honda)

963
01:11:10,554 --> 01:11:12,234
This car is the newest model.

964
01:11:12,259 --> 01:11:13,436
If you are interested,

965
01:11:13,461 --> 01:11:14,975
you can take a test drive.

966
01:11:15,015 --> 01:11:17,366
(Import cars)
There are only a few of them in Thailand.

967
01:11:20,788 --> 01:11:23,436
I will let the driver make a decision.

968
01:11:23,608 --> 01:11:24,608
Yes.

969
01:11:34,374 --> 01:11:36,147
Sorry the number that you've dialed

970
01:11:36,179 --> 01:11:37,859
cannot be connected...

971
01:11:43,663 --> 01:11:44,663
Then...

972
01:11:45,743 --> 01:11:46,782
I'll take this car.

973
01:11:46,807 --> 01:11:48,446
But I'd like to change the name

974
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:49,610
from Thana to Phathit.

975
01:11:49,626 --> 01:11:50,626
Sure, sir.

976
01:11:54,829 --> 01:11:55,852
Ryou,

977
01:11:55,877 --> 01:11:56,923
you sure you don't

978
01:11:56,948 --> 01:11:57,994
want me to sleep over?

979
01:11:58,001 --> 01:11:59,001
Hey.

980
01:11:59,026 --> 01:12:00,305
I'm really fine.

981
01:12:00,392 --> 01:12:01,602
You are too worried.

982
01:12:02,181 --> 01:12:03,381
You can go home.

983
01:12:03,579 --> 01:12:04,798
Fine.

984
01:12:04,892 --> 01:12:06,572
But if you feel unwell,

985
01:12:06,597 --> 01:12:08,680
call me and I'll come right away.

986
01:12:09,829 --> 01:12:10,829
Okay.

987
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:20,500
Boo!

988
01:12:24,402 --> 01:12:26,202
What? Only applying the bandage?

989
01:12:29,425 --> 01:12:31,167
You came to my dorm to bug me?

990
01:12:33,441 --> 01:12:34,441
No.

991
01:12:34,667 --> 01:12:35,729
Why are you here?

992
01:12:36,191 --> 01:12:37,339
I just walked past by.

993
01:12:37,433 --> 01:12:38,846
So I came to see you.

994
01:12:38,995 --> 01:12:40,026
You poor thing.

995
01:12:40,276 --> 01:12:41,276
Bull crap.

996
01:12:41,995 --> 01:12:43,604
Your house is on the other side,

997
01:12:43,629 --> 01:12:44,925
why would you pass by?

998
01:12:45,909 --> 01:12:47,385
Are you worried about me?

999
01:12:54,419 --> 01:12:55,419
Thank you.

1000
01:13:07,392 --> 01:13:08,549
Your body is a bit hot.

1001
01:13:09,877 --> 01:13:11,212
I will stay here tonight.

1002
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:12,462
If you get a fever,

1003
01:13:12,487 --> 01:13:14,142
I can watch you struggling.

1004
01:13:14,689 --> 01:13:15,845
No need,

1005
01:13:15,970 --> 01:13:16,970
I'm fine.

1006
01:13:17,166 --> 01:13:18,846
You won't see it happen.

1007
01:13:19,033 --> 01:13:20,228
You should go home.

1008
01:13:20,627 --> 01:13:22,173
I didn't come to beg for a sleepover.

1009
01:13:22,198 --> 01:13:23,947
I'm saying that I'll sleep with you.

1010
01:13:24,916 --> 01:13:25,978
How is it different?

1011
01:13:26,291 --> 01:13:27,900
You can even tell?

1012
01:13:29,111 --> 01:13:30,595
You're getting a bit fever.

1013
01:13:31,049 --> 01:13:32,049
Come on.

1014
01:13:42,409 --> 01:13:43,409
Ahem.

1015
01:13:45,549 --> 01:13:46,908
Why is such a great doctor

1016
01:13:46,933 --> 01:13:47,955
walking all alone?

1017
01:13:50,526 --> 01:13:51,815
What's with you?

1018
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:53,479
You were a doctor yesterday,

1019
01:13:54,549 --> 01:13:55,752
and now you're a chef?

1020
01:13:56,167 --> 01:13:57,167
I guess.

1021
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,627
It's my day off today.

1022
01:13:58,899 --> 01:14:00,391
So I came to buy some stuff.

1023
01:14:00,938 --> 01:14:01,938
And...

1024
01:14:02,251 --> 01:14:03,829
don't you have to work today?

1025
01:14:05,329 --> 01:14:07,438
Who is working on Saturday?

1026
01:14:11,445 --> 01:14:12,445
Hey.

1027
01:14:13,718 --> 01:14:14,718
Huh?

1028
01:14:15,921 --> 01:14:17,437
Still eating convenience food?

1029
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:19,010
It's not good.

1030
01:14:19,492 --> 01:14:21,265
Why don't you eat properly?

1031
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:22,523
If you get sick,

1032
01:14:22,742 --> 01:14:24,062
I will not treat you.

1033
01:14:26,570 --> 01:14:28,023
Then come and cook for me.

1034
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,866
I have a kitchen at home,

1035
01:14:31,211 --> 01:14:32,259
I'm only lacking

1036
01:14:32,515 --> 01:14:33,515
a chef.

1037
01:14:40,395 --> 01:14:41,465
Hey, just kidding,

1038
01:14:42,371 --> 01:14:43,379
I can do it myself.

1039
01:14:49,355 --> 01:14:50,886
Thana must be very happy,

1040
01:14:51,995 --> 01:14:53,308
eating his boyfriend's cooking

1041
01:14:53,333 --> 01:14:54,333
every day.

1042
01:14:55,511 --> 01:14:56,870
Hurry up to find someone,

1043
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:58,886
so you'll have someone to cook for you.

1044
01:15:00,339 --> 01:15:01,379
Find someone?

1045
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,480
Surely, you’ll find them.

1046
01:15:06,464 --> 01:15:07,464
Are you done?

1047
01:15:08,707 --> 01:15:09,907
Should be done.

1048
01:15:10,324 --> 01:15:11,808
You want to check out now?

1049
01:15:13,105 --> 01:15:14,167
Okay.

1050
01:15:14,433 --> 01:15:15,503
You paying for me?

1051
01:15:16,191 --> 01:15:17,909
Eat properly first and I'll pay.

1052
01:15:50,889 --> 01:15:51,889
Brother.

1053
01:15:52,186 --> 01:15:53,626
How about a puff?

1054
01:15:54,123 --> 01:15:55,185
What a kid.

1055
01:15:55,865 --> 01:15:57,732
Are you asking me to smoke?

1056
01:16:02,071 --> 01:16:03,071
Just one, then.

1057
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:23,880
Here.

1058
01:16:37,576 --> 01:16:39,059
Weak as always.

1059
01:16:49,491 --> 01:16:50,491
Copy me.

1060
01:16:51,288 --> 01:16:52,498
Do this.

(Next episode)
Where did you go?

1063
01:18:00,749 --> 01:18:02,084
I went to buy some stuff.

1064
01:18:02,593 --> 01:18:03,944
Did you secretly smoke?

1065
01:18:04,069 --> 01:18:05,287
I already apologized!

1066
01:18:05,482 --> 01:18:07,162
Why make a fuss about it?

1067
01:18:07,451 --> 01:18:09,248
Did I make him upset?

1068
01:18:09,428 --> 01:18:10,905
Anyone out there?

1069
01:18:12,436 --> 01:18:14,319
Thana's working today.

1070
01:18:14,577 --> 01:18:16,248
Thana's got a new job already?

1071
01:18:16,655 --> 01:18:18,436
Are you hiding something from me?

1072
01:18:19,405 --> 01:18:25,670
(The Luminous Solution)
Can I forget you? I really want to forget.

1073
01:18:27,296 --> 01:18:29,498
Forget everything.

1074
01:18:30,163 --> 01:18:33,522
Even if I wanted to, I can't.

1075
01:18:33,614 --> 01:18:36,536
Forget everything.

1076
01:18:36,585 --> 01:18:38,233
Enough already.

1077
01:18:38,249 --> 01:18:40,006
It's over.

1078
01:18:40,031 --> 01:18:43,420
Forget already.

1079
01:18:43,538 --> 01:18:48,225
Can I forget?

1080
01:18:57,718 --> 01:18:59,663
I just want to forget

1081
01:18:59,688 --> 01:19:02,913
the memories that I still hold tightly.

1082
01:19:03,202 --> 01:19:06,459
Erase your image from my heart.

1083
01:19:06,804 --> 01:19:11,459
Please let me forget, let me forget.

1084
01:19:12,194 --> 01:19:17,177
I just want to forget, how long must I remember?

1085
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:19,895
Like a curse that makes me forget

1086
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:24,458
you last.

1087
01:19:27,411 --> 01:19:29,653
