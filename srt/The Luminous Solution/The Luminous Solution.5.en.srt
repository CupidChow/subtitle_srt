Maslow said that

humans basic needs

60
00:02:53,603 --> 00:02:56,235
are inherent

61
00:02:57,368 --> 00:02:58,790
and consist of five levels,

62
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,383
starting from the lowest to the highest.

63
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:06,719

64
00:03:07,204 --> 00:03:09,001

65
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:10,782
to a satisfactory level

66
00:03:11,563 --> 00:03:14,195

00:03:15,243 --> 00:03:19,626

about the clinic

93
00:05:34,454 --> 00:05:35,814

94
00:05:35,932 --> 00:05:37,665

I'll stop after this new job.

103

What do you mean?

104
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:16,962
Stop smoking or

105
00:06:16,987 --> 00:06:18,032
stop talking to me?

106
00:06:19,845 --> 00:06:21,525
Stop smoking, obviously.

107
00:06:22,455 --> 00:06:23,775
But we might see each other

108
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,853
less than before.

109
00:06:25,908 --> 00:06:26,970
You'll be lonely

110
00:06:27,127 --> 00:06:28,509
without me annoying you.

111
00:06:30,095 --> 00:06:31,095
Really?

112
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,821
More like, I'd feel more at ease.

113
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:36,540
Don't you enjoy our time together?

114
00:06:42,423 --> 00:06:43,509
I feel comfortable

115
00:06:43,534 --> 00:06:44,962
spending time with you.

116
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:49,047
But I should turn over a new leaf.

117
00:06:57,908 --> 00:06:59,407
I guess I would be lonely

118
00:07:00,275 --> 00:07:01,728
if I had to come here alone.

119
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:06,025
But you said you got used to loneliness.

120
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:08,509
Yes, I did.

121
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,759
But since you came into my life,

122
00:07:13,071 --> 00:07:15,204
I don't want to go anywhere alone again.

123

131
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:46,539

Once you’re done.

190
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,708
Return and stand in

191
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:47,927
the corner of the room.

192
00:18:49,818 --> 00:18:50,818
Yes.

193
00:18:55,466 --> 00:18:56,935
Let's continue.

194
00:18:57,318 --> 00:18:59,028
There are other elements as well,

195
00:18:59,053 --> 00:19:01,271
such as oxygen, nitrogen,

196
00:19:01,513 --> 00:19:03,411
phosphorus, and sulfur.

197
00:19:03,436 --> 00:19:05,208
They are mixed together

198
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:06,732

The group of atoms that

202
00:19:19,147 --> 00:19:21,443
exhibit specific molecular properties...

203
00:19:26,326 --> 00:19:27,326
Amazing!

204
00:19:36,498 --> 00:19:38,521
Please congratulate him.

205
00:19:38,546 --> 00:19:40,771
At noon today, Mai will be picking up

206
00:19:40,796 --> 00:19:43,403
the trash in the courtyard.

207
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,458
Big round of applause, please!

210
00:20:15,033 --> 00:20:16,016
Mr. Thana,

211
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,095
the manager would like to see you now.

212
00:20:18,268 --> 00:20:19,268
Yes.

214
00:20:34,152 --> 00:20:35,721
Here’s Mr. Thana.

215
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:37,714
Please take a seat, Mr. Thana.

216
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:38,738
Hello.

217
00:20:41,965 --> 00:20:44,363
I can leave the sales job to you, right?

218
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:45,785
Yes.

219
00:20:45,816 --> 00:20:47,416
I will try my best.

220
00:20:48,043 --> 00:20:49,472
Good.

221
00:20:49,497 --> 00:20:51,206
That lady is my secretary.

222
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,732
She will help you.

223
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,542
If you have any questions,

224
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:55,613
please ask her.

225
00:20:55,638 --> 00:20:56,638
Yes.

226
00:20:56,941 --> 00:20:58,621
I will be in your care.

227
00:20:58,777 --> 00:20:59,777
My pleasure.

228
00:21:01,082 --> 00:21:02,122
Do your best.

229
00:21:02,176 --> 00:21:03,176
Yes.

Sorry, the number that you've dialed

cannot be connected...

234
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:55,396
You just started today

235
00:21:55,421 --> 00:21:57,264
but you already secured a deal.

236
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,451
Amazing.

237
00:21:59,811 --> 00:22:00,833
You flatter me.

238
00:22:00,858 --> 00:22:02,561
I still have a lot to learn.

239
00:22:03,116 --> 00:22:04,553
You are humble.

240
00:22:04,578 --> 00:22:06,258
Keep up the good work.

241
00:22:06,803 --> 00:22:07,803
Yes.

242
00:22:08,358 --> 00:22:09,740
Please excuse me then...

243
00:22:18,878 --> 00:22:19,878
Mai!

244
00:22:32,732 --> 00:22:33,732
Thank you.

245
00:22:33,927 --> 00:22:35,047
Eat up.

246
00:22:35,864 --> 00:22:36,984
My hands are dirty.

247
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:41,020
Fine. I'll open the seal for you.

248
00:22:41,896 --> 00:22:44,286
Geez, Ryou.

249
00:22:44,505 --> 00:22:46,005
You quickly had lunch

250
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,036
to come flirt with Mai.

251
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:49,419
What flirting?

252
00:22:50,122 --> 00:22:51,380
I just felt sorry for him.

253
00:22:51,405 --> 00:22:53,114
I was afraid he would be hungry.

254
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:54,579
What if he fainted?

255
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,880
So what did you buy? Can I have some?

256
00:23:02,185 --> 00:23:03,185
Go ahead.

257
00:23:03,318 --> 00:23:04,411
I'll take this.

258
00:23:08,215 --> 00:23:09,215
Mai!

259
00:23:09,966 --> 00:23:11,255
You finish cleaning up?

260
00:23:11,785 --> 00:23:12,933
It's time for practice.

261
00:23:17,106 --> 00:23:18,106
Just go.

262
00:23:21,989 --> 00:23:23,137
I'll leave it to you, Dena.

263
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:24,622
Huh?

264
00:23:25,622 --> 00:23:26,480
Fighting.

265
00:23:26,504 --> 00:23:27,739
Can you believe him?

266
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:30,083
Does he really want me to do this?

267
00:23:30,427 --> 00:23:32,239
How can I do something like that?

268
00:23:32,264 --> 00:23:33,384
It's so dirty. Here.

269
00:23:34,153 --> 00:23:35,661
Stop! He told you to help.

270
00:23:35,685 --> 00:23:36,805
It's so dirty.

271
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,567
Just leave here and come back into it.

272
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,794
Move, I'm going to sit.

273
00:23:51,393 --> 00:23:53,252
Listening to music now, are we?

274
00:23:57,874 --> 00:23:59,154
Let me listen, too.

275
00:24:16,945 --> 00:24:18,385
Is it a love song?

276
00:24:19,773 --> 00:24:21,053
Are you in love?

277
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,890
You like Mai, don't cha?

278
00:24:28,937 --> 00:24:30,457
Or do you like Nack?

279
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:34,100
So, do you like Mai or Nack?

280
00:24:38,884 --> 00:24:39,884
You see...

281
00:24:42,033 --> 00:24:43,766
I told Nack already that...

282
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,696
I only think of him as a friend.

283
00:24:57,048 --> 00:24:58,568
Does this mean that...

284
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,149
you like Mai?

285
00:25:09,117 --> 00:25:10,117
I...

286
00:25:19,257 --> 00:25:20,851
Shall we skip to another song?

287
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:22,781
Sure, what song?

288
00:25:39,014 --> 00:25:40,014
Do you like Ryou?

289
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,750
No.

290
00:25:47,499 --> 00:25:48,499
I like Ryou.

291
00:25:52,062 --> 00:25:53,320
That’s not my business.

293
00:26:01,468 --> 00:26:03,038
Dr. Phathit! There's an urgent

294
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:04,124
patient case right now!

295
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:05,265
The other doctors are busy.

296
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:07,398
We need you to go with the lead surgeon.

297
00:26:07,423 --> 00:26:09,546
I called you, why didn't you pick up?

298
00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:12,405
I’m sorry. I set it on mute.

299
00:26:12,742 --> 00:26:13,788

Sister Pen...

304
00:27:15,388 --> 00:27:16,388
Yes?

305
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,146
Thank you so much.

306
00:27:30,763 --> 00:27:32,363
My dear Dr. Phathit,

307
00:27:34,295 --> 00:27:36,028
you should get some rest.

308
00:27:38,263 --> 00:27:39,997
No matter what happened to you,

309
00:27:40,678 --> 00:27:42,536
in my eyes, you are always

310
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:44,628
the most amazing to me.

311
00:27:50,904 --> 00:27:51,935
I understand.

312
00:27:52,435 --> 00:27:53,552
No matter how

313
00:27:53,607 --> 00:27:54,646
skilled we are,

314
00:27:54,671 --> 00:27:56,341
we all have our vulnerable days.

315
00:27:56,366 --> 00:27:58,566
Today is just one of those days.

316
00:27:59,771 --> 00:28:01,301
I want you to remember the days

317
00:28:01,326 --> 00:28:02,566
when you were strong.

318
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,482
And the days when you were proud.

319
00:28:17,336 --> 00:28:18,406
I am trying.

320
00:28:20,329 --> 00:28:22,328
I am trying to be fine...

321
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:31,852
To become a doctor or a nurse,

322
00:28:32,688 --> 00:28:33,789
there are many things

323
00:28:33,814 --> 00:28:35,227
that need to be sacrificed.

324
00:28:35,252 --> 00:28:37,266
Everyone must sacrifice.

325
00:28:38,227 --> 00:28:39,320
It all depends on

326
00:28:39,345 --> 00:28:41,025
how each person manages.

327
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:52,117
Thank you

328
00:28:52,602 --> 00:28:55,336
for letting me see your vulnerable side.

329
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:58,697
Thank you so much. Sister Pen.

330
00:29:43,426 --> 00:29:44,426
Mai! Come here!

331
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:48,457
What’s wrong with you today?

332
00:29:49,403 --> 00:29:50,746
Those were all bad shots!

333
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,582

Start!

337
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:41,043
Are you alright?

338
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:42,106
Go away!

339
00:30:48,593 --> 00:30:49,859
What’s wrong with you?

340
00:30:51,906 --> 00:30:52,906
I’m sorry.

341
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,268
I made you a sandwich,

342
00:31:03,293 --> 00:31:04,463
don’t forget to eat.

343
00:31:10,248 --> 00:31:12,873
Please, take care of yourself there.

344
00:31:14,709 --> 00:31:16,615
Write me some letters, dear.

345
00:31:17,677 --> 00:31:18,717
Can I not go?

346
00:31:23,201 --> 00:31:24,271
It's tough

347
00:31:25,974 --> 00:31:27,174
living with me.

348
00:31:30,998 --> 00:31:32,912
We have spoken about this.

349
00:31:34,334 --> 00:31:35,334
Yes.

350
00:31:37,326 --> 00:31:38,568
I love you, dear.

351
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:41,388
I love you, too.

352
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:44,850
Let's hug.

353
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,110
Let's get going.

354
00:34:16,003 --> 00:34:17,003
Did you...

355
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:19,948
fight with Mai again?

356
00:34:20,738 --> 00:34:22,855
He suddenly got upset and ran away.

357
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:25,863
Strange.

358
00:34:43,565 --> 00:34:44,799
I just finished practice.

359
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:47,806
Can both of you wait for me?

360
00:34:48,228 --> 00:34:49,486
I will drive you home.

361
00:35:05,504 --> 00:35:07,745
Thanks! Drive safe.

362
00:35:19,415 --> 00:35:20,615
Are you hungry?

363
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,376
Not really.

364
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,001
You just finished with your practice,

365
00:35:27,026 --> 00:35:28,220
I guess you are, huh?

366
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:30,245
Just a little.

367
00:35:37,031 --> 00:35:38,471
About my rejection,

368
00:35:40,335 --> 00:35:41,600
were you okay with that?

369
00:35:44,413 --> 00:35:46,147
You're being inconsiderate.

370
00:35:49,054 --> 00:35:50,116
Thank you.

371
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,585
But I want to stay friends

372
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,694
with you forever.

373
00:35:59,913 --> 00:36:00,913
Forever?

374
00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:04,709
I am not sure.

375
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:14,087
But I can still like you, right?

376
00:36:38,065 --> 00:36:39,472

377
00:36:44,871 --> 00:36:47,353

00:37:11,975 --> 00:37:14,139
Hello, Thana. What's up?

382
00:37:14,796 --> 00:37:16,256
Have you talked to Phathit?

383
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:18,631
Straight to the point. Just like that?

384
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:21,190
Not going to ask how I'm doing?

385
00:37:21,491 --> 00:37:22,623
I don't see the point.

386
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,326
All right, fine.

387
00:37:25,351 --> 00:37:27,031
Did you guys fight again?

388
00:37:27,483 --> 00:37:28,483
Yeah.

389
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,038
We did.

390
00:37:32,725 --> 00:37:34,787
I'm not going to ask what it's about.

391
00:37:36,038 --> 00:37:38,171
But I talked to him this morning,

392
00:37:38,553 --> 00:37:40,264
he seemed normal.

393
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,014
He still wanted to meet up

394
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:43,225
for a meal next week.

395
00:37:44,038 --> 00:37:45,038
Thank you.

396
00:37:46,217 --> 00:37:47,794
I will try to reconcile with him.

397
00:37:48,608 --> 00:37:49,608
Don't worry.

398
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:51,131
Good.

399
00:37:51,147 --> 00:37:53,350
Quickly make up with him.

400
00:37:54,592 --> 00:37:56,272
And keep me informed too.

401
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,225
Okay. Bye.

402
00:38:28,953 --> 00:38:29,953
Hey, Phathit.

403
00:38:30,312 --> 00:38:31,468
What are you doing?

404
00:38:32,297 --> 00:38:33,718
Let's go see them installing the

405
00:38:33,743 --> 00:38:35,726
treatment room in the clinic together.

406
00:38:37,984 --> 00:38:39,742
I have a case now.

407
00:38:40,266 --> 00:38:41,390
And

408
00:38:41,835 --> 00:38:43,054
I am too tired to go.

409
00:38:43,414 --> 00:38:45,960
Can I leave it to you?

410
00:38:49,023 --> 00:38:50,578
Alright. I will go on my own.

411
00:38:52,156 --> 00:38:53,531
You should get some rest.

412
00:39:00,141 --> 00:39:01,587
Regardless...

413
00:39:01,603 --> 00:39:02,603
thank you.

414
00:39:04,455 --> 00:39:05,455
It's nothing.

415
00:39:05,923 --> 00:39:07,212
I will go check it for you.

416
00:39:12,798 --> 00:39:13,798
Hey, Phathit.

417
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:17,001
Can I just say something?

418
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:19,564
Of course.

419
00:39:20,961 --> 00:39:23,062
I am not okay seeing you like this.

420
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,040
If you have any problems,

421
00:39:27,525 --> 00:39:29,001
I hope you can talk to me.

422
00:39:31,855 --> 00:39:33,214
I don’t know how to start.

423
00:39:34,277 --> 00:39:35,511
Just say it.

424
00:39:44,678 --> 00:39:46,725
My boyfriend has been cheating on me.

425
00:40:01,011 --> 00:40:02,949
Is he aware that you know?

426
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,308
No, he doesn’t.

427
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,200
Do you want to tell him?

428
00:40:10,528 --> 00:40:11,528
Maybe not.

429
00:40:13,872 --> 00:40:15,199
Now that you found out,

430
00:40:17,528 --> 00:40:18,645
do you still love him?

431
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:28,122
I’m not sure at all.

432
00:40:31,661 --> 00:40:32,965
But what I know is that

433
00:40:36,536 --> 00:40:38,067
I can't live without him.

434
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:41,520
You have to answer that yourself,

435
00:40:43,317 --> 00:40:45,770
whether the reason you're still together

436
00:40:48,224 --> 00:40:49,262
is it due to love

437
00:40:51,364 --> 00:40:52,564
or just habit.

438
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,700
In the past,

439
00:40:56,232 --> 00:40:57,504
I was confident

440
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:00,170
that it was love.

441
00:41:01,685 --> 00:41:02,685
And now?

442
00:41:04,075 --> 00:41:05,355
Can you answer yourself?

443
00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:08,129
Are you still in love with him

444
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:11,903
or have you fallen out of love?

445
00:41:17,927 --> 00:41:19,309
I am still in love with him.

446
00:41:29,516 --> 00:41:30,664
If you are still in love,

447
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:33,555
it is okay

448
00:41:35,352 --> 00:41:36,352
to forgive him.

449
00:41:38,899 --> 00:41:39,899
Forgive?

450
00:41:47,102 --> 00:41:48,142
Listen to me.

451
00:41:50,016 --> 00:41:51,039
If you love him,

452
00:41:51,594 --> 00:41:52,609
just forgive him.

453
00:41:54,328 --> 00:41:55,531
And you guys

454
00:41:56,297 --> 00:41:57,616
should talk about it.

455
00:42:07,439 --> 00:42:08,439
Alright.

456
00:42:13,588 --> 00:42:14,948
Thank you so much.

457
00:42:16,564 --> 00:42:18,119
Whenever you're in trouble,

458
00:42:18,541 --> 00:42:19,876
you can talk to me.

459
00:42:22,181 --> 00:42:23,541
Get a lot of rest.

460
00:42:40,994 --> 00:42:45,712
(The Luminous Solution)

461
00:42:46,737 --> 00:42:53,072
(The Luminous Solution)

462
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:11,743
Sorry, the number that you've dialed

463
00:43:11,768 --> 00:43:12,985
cannot be connected...

464
00:43:45,218 --> 00:43:46,498
Yes, sister Pen?

465
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:48,726
I just want to see if you are

466
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:49,796
already off duty.

467
00:43:50,312 --> 00:43:52,218
I want to invite you to eat Thai BBQ.

468
00:43:52,664 --> 00:43:54,788
I invited Earn and Oil, too.

469
00:43:55,718 --> 00:43:57,015
Would you like to come?

470
00:43:58,672 --> 00:43:59,672
All right.

471
00:43:59,711 --> 00:44:01,311
Let me pack my stuff.

472
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,913
I will go and get changed now.

473
00:44:04,922 --> 00:44:05,922
Sure.

474
00:44:58,974 --> 00:45:00,841
(Thana)

475
00:45:03,482 --> 00:45:05,052

476
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,894
(Thana)

477
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,700
(Thana)

478
00:45:31,818 --> 00:45:33,310
Thanks for driving me home.

479
00:45:34,013 --> 00:45:35,013
My pleasure.

480
00:45:45,354 --> 00:45:48,549
So, what did the coach say to Mai today?

481
00:45:50,494 --> 00:45:51,694
He seemed upset.

482
00:45:55,595 --> 00:45:56,799
He seemed unfocused,

483
00:45:56,822 --> 00:45:57,845
so he was scolded.

484
00:45:59,549 --> 00:46:00,749
But it's normal.

485
00:46:02,228 --> 00:46:03,580
It happens to everyone.

486
00:46:05,143 --> 00:46:06,143
I see.

487
00:46:10,205 --> 00:46:11,822
You seem so worried about him.

488
00:46:25,372 --> 00:46:26,372
I'm off, then.

489
00:46:27,911 --> 00:46:28,911
See ya.

490
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,599
(Ryou)

491
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:19,802
Mai.

492
00:47:20,098 --> 00:47:21,427
Did you make a decision?

493
00:47:21,865 --> 00:47:24,380
Will you come with us or stay here?

494
00:47:29,273 --> 00:47:30,953
You can stay if you want,

495
00:47:31,141 --> 00:47:33,007
Just make a clear decision.

496
00:47:43,141 --> 00:47:44,141
Mai.

497
00:47:44,648 --> 00:47:45,688
You're a man,

498
00:47:45,869 --> 00:47:47,289
speak your mind.

499
00:47:47,953 --> 00:47:49,570
If you want to stay, then stay.

500
00:47:49,595 --> 00:47:51,115
I'm not complaining.

501
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:53,171
I'm just asking you

502
00:47:53,187 --> 00:47:54,484
to fulfill your role.

503
00:47:54,766 --> 00:47:56,279
Don't get any girls pregnant.

504
00:47:56,304 --> 00:47:57,539
Dad.

505
00:47:59,664 --> 00:48:00,796
That's all I'm asking.

506
00:48:01,851 --> 00:48:02,891
You're a man,

507
00:48:03,258 --> 00:48:05,007
don't be afraid to make a decision.

508
00:48:08,195 --> 00:48:09,195
Eat up.

509
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:27,680
(Doctor room)

510
00:48:33,657 --> 00:48:34,657
Oh!

511
00:48:36,336 --> 00:48:37,976
Sorry, who are you looking for?

512
00:48:38,774 --> 00:48:40,187
I’m looking for Dr. Phathit.

513
00:48:44,946 --> 00:48:45,992
Are you a patient?

514
00:48:46,422 --> 00:48:48,328
No, I’m his boyfriend.

515
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:51,219
Boyfriend?

516
00:48:53,547 --> 00:48:56,390
He already went outside.

517
00:48:58,273 --> 00:48:59,640
When will he get back?

518
00:49:00,515 --> 00:49:01,680
I don’t really know.

519
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:05,101
He was off-duty for a while.

520
00:49:05,126 --> 00:49:06,806
You can give him a call.

521
00:49:10,774 --> 00:49:12,640
Do you know where he went to?

522
00:49:12,899 --> 00:49:15,375
Are you really his boyfriend?

523
00:49:16,172 --> 00:49:18,211
Why do you not know where he went?

524
00:49:24,953 --> 00:49:27,367
You can go check the medical dormitory.

525
00:49:27,392 --> 00:49:28,832
He might be there.

526
00:49:31,047 --> 00:49:32,167
Where is that?

527
00:49:32,555 --> 00:49:33,915
More questions...

528
00:49:35,625 --> 00:49:38,320
Behind the hospital.

529
00:49:38,345 --> 00:49:39,539
Just follow this path

530
00:49:39,563 --> 00:49:41,500
and take a left turn, another left,

531
00:49:41,525 --> 00:49:42,645
another left...

532
00:49:42,766 --> 00:49:43,766
then you've already missed it.

533
00:49:44,961 --> 00:49:47,028
Return and take the right turn.

534
00:49:47,821 --> 00:49:48,937
You’ll find it.

535
00:49:51,484 --> 00:49:52,398
Thank you.

536
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:53,430
Yes.

537
00:49:56,375 --> 00:49:58,055
So persistent, so many questions.

538
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:12,164
Doctor, please eat more.

539
00:50:12,774 --> 00:50:15,055
Let me help you.

540
00:50:16,516 --> 00:50:17,758
Don't overdo it.

541
00:50:17,783 --> 00:50:18,805
I heard someone's

542
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:20,266
picking you up tonight.

543
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:22,461
It's nothing serious.

544
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:25,547
I'm just trying to lighten up the mood.

545
00:50:25,899 --> 00:50:27,579
He seems stressed out.

546
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,680
Yeah sure.

547
00:50:28,766 --> 00:50:30,305
Just joking, huh?

548
00:50:30,922 --> 00:50:33,122
Your boyfriend is here already.

549
00:50:33,579 --> 00:50:36,258
Wow! He seemed upset.

550
00:50:36,532 --> 00:50:37,532
Where?

551
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:41,070
You got tricked!

552
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:43,781
Geez, guys!

553
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:45,469
I don't have an appetite now.

554
00:50:45,907 --> 00:50:48,563
Come on. Eat up. Let's continue.

555
00:50:48,938 --> 00:50:49,883
Let's continue.

556
00:50:49,899 --> 00:50:50,939
Let's dig in.

557
00:50:53,547 --> 00:50:55,969
Mai, I am leaving now.

558
00:52:40,884 --> 00:52:44,047
The two of use are leaving now, see you!

559
00:52:44,368 --> 00:52:45,665
- Goodbye, sister Pen.
- Goodbye.

560
00:52:45,673 --> 00:52:47,477
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

561
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,040
Bye!

562
00:52:52,361 --> 00:52:54,295
Are you heading home now?

563
00:52:55,143 --> 00:52:57,119
I will stay at the medical dormitory.

564
00:52:59,228 --> 00:53:00,705
I won't be home for a while.

565
00:53:02,924 --> 00:53:04,642
You can stay there

566
00:53:04,667 --> 00:53:06,347
until you feel better.

567
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,440
And how will you go home?

568
00:53:10,814 --> 00:53:12,334
I will take a taxi.

569
00:53:13,143 --> 00:53:15,064
Alright, sure. See you.

570
00:53:15,424 --> 00:53:16,853
Yes, I'm off then.

571
00:53:17,088 --> 00:53:18,189
See you tomorrow.

572
00:53:18,986 --> 00:53:20,258
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

573
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:21,330
Take care.

574
00:53:52,217 --> 00:53:54,139
(Mai)

575
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:57,170
(Call)

576
00:54:40,472 --> 00:54:43,886
Why doesn't my heart

577
00:54:44,442 --> 00:54:46,205
listen?

578
00:54:47,489 --> 00:54:51,088
The more I try to forget,

579
00:54:51,511 --> 00:54:53,924
the more I remember.

580
00:55:41,812 --> 00:55:42,812
Babe.

581
00:55:43,304 --> 00:55:44,991
Why didn't you answer my calls?

582
00:55:45,952 --> 00:55:47,366
You don't even come home.

583
00:55:50,085 --> 00:55:51,388
Come out and let's talk.

584
00:55:54,022 --> 00:55:55,022
Babe!

585
00:55:55,491 --> 00:55:56,834
What’s wrong? Let's talk!

586
00:55:59,069 --> 00:56:00,467
What’s wrong with you?

587
00:56:00,538 --> 00:56:01,538
Hey!

588
00:56:01,694 --> 00:56:03,061
Come out and let's talk!

589
00:56:03,483 --> 00:56:05,045
Why the heck are you quiet?

590
00:56:08,397 --> 00:56:09,397
Speak!

591
00:56:36,367 --> 00:56:37,367
I’m sorry.

592
00:56:39,126 --> 00:56:40,150
Please…

593
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:44,884
Come out and talk, please…

00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:43,719
(Next episode)
Do you know

596
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:46,555
I'm being tortured by your treatment?

597
00:57:46,821 --> 00:57:48,211
I saw you with that boy.

598
00:57:48,236 --> 00:57:49,344
I didn’t mean it.

599
00:57:49,547 --> 00:57:50,812
You didn’t mean it?

600
00:57:51,118 --> 00:57:52,305
It won’t happen again.

601
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:56,000
How would you feel if I did that to you?

602
00:57:57,570 --> 00:57:58,813
I just wanted us to go back

603
00:57:58,838 --> 00:57:59,789
to how we were.

604
00:57:59,814 --> 00:58:00,898
And my feelings?

605
00:58:00,923 --> 00:58:02,657
Can I still feel the same?

606
00:58:04,164 --> 00:58:10,429
(The Luminous Solution)
Can I forget you? I really want to forget.

607
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:14,257
Forget everything.

608
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:18,348
Even if I wanted to, I can't.

609
00:58:18,373 --> 00:58:21,295
Forget everything.

610
00:58:21,344 --> 00:58:22,992
Enough already.

611
00:58:23,008 --> 00:58:24,765
It's over.

612
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:28,179
Forget already.

613
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:32,991
Can I forget?

614
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,422
I just want to forget

615
00:58:44,447 --> 00:58:47,672
the memories that I still hold tightly

616
00:58:47,961 --> 00:58:51,218
Erase your image from my heart.

617
00:58:51,563 --> 00:58:56,218
Please let me forget, let me forget.

618
00:58:56,953 --> 00:58:58,782
I just want to forget,

619
00:58:58,807 --> 00:59:02,085
how long must I remember?

620
00:59:02,178 --> 00:59:04,654
Like a curse that makes me forget

621
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:09,217
you last.

622
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:14,412
Can I forget you,

623
00:59:14,437 --> 00:59:17,764
I just want to forget
