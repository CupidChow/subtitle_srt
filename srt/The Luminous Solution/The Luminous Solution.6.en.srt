Why didn't you pick up my call?

You didn't even go home!

Why didn't you say something?

I'm sorry.

55
00:02:45,135 --> 00:02:47,192
Come out and talk, please.
I'm begging you.

56
00:02:50,135 --> 00:02:53,650
I keep telling you about
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs,

57
00:02:54,135 --> 00:02:57,107
that failed to let you know
the rules for this magic store.

58
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,790
You will only get one wish.

59
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,790
Once your wish has been granted.

60
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,078
The key on my neck
will turn a copper color,

61
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,230
which means...

62
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,620
it is about time for this cafe

63
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,078
to set me free.

64
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,735
I’ve told you many times

65
00:03:30,735 --> 00:03:32,730
that you do not belong here.

66
00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:37,992
Miss,

67
00:03:39,021 --> 00:03:40,478
listen to me.

68
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,710
I am here today…

69
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,078
…to say good bye.

70
00:03:57,735 --> 00:03:59,164
I’d better leave soon.

71
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:02,850
Actually...

72
00:04:04,135 --> 00:04:05,964
I was looking for someone.

73
00:04:12,192 --> 00:04:13,710
But I have to give up now.

74
00:04:21,021 --> 00:04:23,735
I think I’m heading
back to the USA soon.

75
00:04:24,107 --> 00:04:25,307
When?

76
00:04:26,164 --> 00:04:27,300
In a couple days.

77
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:30,335
As I said,

78
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:35,030
Some people can never be
pleased with what they get.

79
00:04:35,392 --> 00:04:36,730
When you get into something,

80
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:39,678
you always hope it's more than it is.

81
00:04:39,992 --> 00:04:42,707
According to the cafe rules,

82
00:04:43,535 --> 00:04:47,221
you would be able to make one more wish.

83
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,278
But,

84
00:04:49,364 --> 00:04:56,430
you have to stay in this cafe forever
until all the keys turn into copper.

85
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,250
Does it sound easy?

86
00:04:58,335 --> 00:05:01,530
I'm telling you now that it’s not!

87
00:05:06,935 --> 00:05:09,270
Sorry to keep you waiting.

88
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,950
I’m alright.

89
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,821
How are you today? Are you tired?

90
00:05:14,507 --> 00:05:15,820
I was,

91
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,820
but I’m getting better now.

92
00:05:18,107 --> 00:05:19,364
Huh? Why is that?

93
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:21,907
Maybe because I got to see your face.

94
00:05:23,392 --> 00:05:24,564
Smooth-tongued.

95
00:05:26,621 --> 00:05:28,192
How do you know
I've got a smooth tongue?

96
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:30,907
Because I’ve tasted it.

97
00:05:32,907 --> 00:05:33,878
Well...

98
00:05:34,307 --> 00:05:35,050
You aren't bored yet?

99
00:05:37,678 --> 00:05:38,650
I like it.

100
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,335
You've got a smooth-tongue yourself.

101
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,392
Shall we taste it once again?

102
00:05:48,507 --> 00:05:49,507
Here and now?

103
00:05:50,992 --> 00:05:51,850
Who cares?

104
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,850
I don’t but…

105
00:05:57,335 --> 00:05:58,764
I see...

106
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,964
Because you are going to be a Doctor,

107
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,278
that's why you're being
condescending, right?

108
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:05,550
Don’t you dare.

109
00:06:06,535 --> 00:06:08,050
Which patient's doctor would you be,

110
00:06:08,221 --> 00:06:09,160
I don't know.

111
00:06:09,507 --> 00:06:11,620
But you are my one and only

112
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,507
boyfriend.

113
00:06:16,021 --> 00:06:16,850
I know that.

114
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:18,278
Thanks.

115
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,164
Thanks for what?

116
00:06:21,564 --> 00:06:23,364
Thanks for your understanding

117
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:24,450
and...

118
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,735
thank you for being here.

119
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:29,164
I'm willing to do so.

120
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:33,250
Come on.

121
00:06:33,992 --> 00:06:34,678
Let's go home.

122
00:06:35,678 --> 00:06:37,221
Well...

123
00:06:38,592 --> 00:06:39,621
Can I ride on your back?

124
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:43,507
The doctor probably
works so hard today.

125
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,135
Hard as usual.

126
00:06:47,592 --> 00:06:48,678
But today...

127
00:06:49,135 --> 00:06:50,335
I need a special treat.

128
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:52,330
Come on.

129
00:06:58,535 --> 00:06:59,678
Are you sure?

130
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:04,192
I’m getting used to it.

131
00:07:05,164 --> 00:07:05,821
And tonight...

132
00:07:06,821 --> 00:07:07,650
I will let you ride me.

133
00:07:09,935 --> 00:07:10,735
Take care.

134
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:11,478
Come on.

135
00:08:33,992 --> 00:08:34,878
Do you know...

136
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:40,250
what you are doing is torturing me?

137
00:08:52,592 --> 00:08:53,792
Calm down.

138
00:08:55,364 --> 00:08:56,250
Let’s talk.

139
00:09:09,221 --> 00:09:10,078
I’m sorry.

140
00:09:12,964 --> 00:09:13,964
For what?

141
00:09:15,592 --> 00:09:16,678
About our fight.

142
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:23,107
You don't know anything, do you?

143
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:26,735
So...

144
00:09:28,307 --> 00:09:29,707
Why do you run away from me?

145
00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:34,964
That day...

146
00:09:35,935 --> 00:09:37,192
at the fire exit,

147
00:09:41,392 --> 00:09:42,870
I saw you with that boy.

148
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:50,678
I’m sorry.

149
00:09:53,364 --> 00:09:54,735
I didn’t mean it.

150
00:09:56,935 --> 00:09:57,735
Can cheating...

151
00:09:59,592 --> 00:10:00,992
happen by mistake?

152
00:10:01,964 --> 00:10:03,678
I don’t know how to explain.

153
00:10:04,907 --> 00:10:06,050
However, I can reassure

154
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,278
that isn't about love at all.

155
00:10:10,164 --> 00:10:12,335
You don’t have to explain anything.

156
00:10:13,992 --> 00:10:15,907
I'm trying to understand this on my own.

157
00:10:17,392 --> 00:10:18,421
We have been together for so long,

158
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:21,621
this kind of thing can happen.

159
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:23,992
I promise...

160
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:26,278
it won’t never happen again.

161
00:10:27,564 --> 00:10:28,907
You don’t have to.

162
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,535
We have been together for so long.

163
00:10:34,335 --> 00:10:36,250
If this problem hadn't happened now,

164
00:10:37,764 --> 00:10:38,678
it would happen

165
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:40,670
in the future anyway.

166
00:10:40,992 --> 00:10:41,707
No.

167
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,535
It won’t happen to the two of us again.

168
00:10:47,621 --> 00:10:49,421
Shall we fix this?

169
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:56,707
Should we try
to have an open relationship?

170
00:10:58,392 --> 00:10:59,021
How?

171
00:11:00,564 --> 00:11:01,364
You...

172
00:11:03,592 --> 00:11:05,078
can have somebody else,

173
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:09,535
you can have sex with anyone,

174
00:11:11,792 --> 00:11:13,535
but I just want you
to tell me everything.

175
00:11:16,164 --> 00:11:17,592
And I will never ever
stop you from doing that.

176
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:21,764
No.

177
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:25,850
I don’t want somebody else,

178
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,335
all I need is you.

179
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:33,278
But what I saw

180
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,564
is not what it seems.

181
00:11:38,135 --> 00:11:39,850
I really didn’t mean it.

182
00:11:40,464 --> 00:11:42,093
I just went with the flow.

183
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:45,250
What if I did the same to you,

184
00:11:46,307 --> 00:11:47,821
How the hell would you feel?

185
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:54,850
I would feel bad for sure.

186
00:11:55,564 --> 00:11:57,392
I would feel really terrible.

187
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:00,192
Let's not be like that.

188
00:12:00,592 --> 00:12:03,964
I just want us to be
focus on our relationship like before,

189
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,960
Just like the first day we met.

190
00:12:06,135 --> 00:12:07,050
Right now,

191
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:08,792
The more we talk, the more we fight.

192
00:12:08,878 --> 00:12:09,821
The reason you cheated,

193
00:12:11,907 --> 00:12:13,450
you are blaming it on me now?

194
00:12:16,021 --> 00:12:17,392
I didn't blame you.

195
00:12:18,792 --> 00:12:19,390
And you know that.

196
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,478
So what do you want me to do?

197
00:12:26,592 --> 00:12:27,678
Tell me.

198
00:12:27,678 --> 00:12:29,670
You don't just go cheat on someone else.

199
00:12:30,392 --> 00:12:31,935
Now I am asking you
to have an open relationship,

200
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,821
you just don't want it.

201
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:40,135
I only want us to be where we started.

202
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,710
How about my feelings?

203
00:12:42,735 --> 00:12:44,307
Can it be the same as before?

204
00:13:04,478 --> 00:13:06,221
You just need to forget about it.

205
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,907
Let's forget about the past.

206
00:13:12,135 --> 00:13:13,307
And start all over again.

207
00:13:25,707 --> 00:13:27,364
Why does it sound easy for you?

208
00:13:30,621 --> 00:13:31,678
I know...

209
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:34,707
It's all my fault.

210
00:13:36,878 --> 00:13:37,964
Please forgive me.

211
00:13:53,878 --> 00:13:54,907
I have had enough.

212
00:14:00,878 --> 00:14:01,907
Arguing now...

213
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:05,564
won't make anything better.

214
00:14:07,364 --> 00:14:08,507
You’d better go back first.

215
00:14:09,764 --> 00:14:10,250
No.

216
00:14:11,507 --> 00:14:13,335
I need to clear things up right away.

217
00:14:19,764 --> 00:14:21,078
Don't be stubborn.

218
00:14:32,878 --> 00:14:33,735
I can go back now...

219
00:14:35,964 --> 00:14:37,678
But can you promise me,

220
00:14:39,507 --> 00:14:40,792
that you will pick up my call?

221
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:45,821
Alright,

222
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:49,050
I promise.

You can tell me anything.

227
00:16:17,378 --> 00:16:18,607
Last time when you said...

228
00:16:19,235 --> 00:16:20,600
you would stand by me forever.

229
00:16:21,635 --> 00:16:22,600
You were telling the truth, right?

Yes.

Mai!

236
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,550
Mai! Wait, please.

you came so early today.

- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

257

You work so hard. Be careful,
the others will bother you.

258

I don’t think so.

259
00:21:01,064 --> 00:21:02,807
However, I will do my best.

260
00:21:03,378 --> 00:21:03,921
Great!

Having someone
who is so eager on my team,

262
00:21:06,635 --> 00:21:07,521
I am so thankful.

Good morning, doctor.

268

Pen, what happened to her?

269
00:21:28,207 --> 00:21:30,664
There is a rash on her arm, doctor.

270
00:21:31,007 --> 00:21:33,092
Can I have a look, please?

271
00:21:33,978 --> 00:21:34,664
Yes.

- It's right here.
- Alright.

274
00:21:41,207 --> 00:21:43,350
I had the flu too.

275
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,235
Alright.

276
00:21:47,035 --> 00:21:47,978
Well...

277
00:21:48,092 --> 00:21:49,292
From what I have seen,

278
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,521
There's nothing to worry about. I
think you might have an allergic reaction.

279
00:21:53,835 --> 00:21:56,292
I'll give you some topical
and oral medication.

280
00:21:58,407 --> 00:21:59,521
Doctor,

281
00:22:01,864 --> 00:22:02,664
I...

282
00:22:03,477 --> 00:22:04,991
didn't have anything serious, right?

283
00:22:05,435 --> 00:22:06,970
I am afraid I will get shingles.

284
00:22:07,321 --> 00:22:08,970
There is an old saying,

285
00:22:09,407 --> 00:22:13,178
if it spreads all over my body,
it would kill me.

286
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,292
No worry at all.

287
00:22:17,092 --> 00:22:18,464
So, you...

288
00:22:18,978 --> 00:22:21,321
apply medication and take medication
as I said.

289
00:22:22,178 --> 00:22:24,921
You will be fine in a week, I promise.

290
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,235
Are you sure, doctor?

291
00:22:29,435 --> 00:22:30,892
I am sure.

292
00:22:31,264 --> 00:22:33,007
Anyway, I will give you a prescription.

293
00:22:34,407 --> 00:22:35,864
Only one condition,

294
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:41,178
You need to apply and take the medication,

295
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,721
and rest well.

296
00:22:43,835 --> 00:22:45,064
Then you will be just fine.

297
00:22:46,207 --> 00:22:47,464
Ok, doctor.

298
00:22:48,778 --> 00:22:51,864
- Thank you, doctor.
- Thank you.

299
00:23:05,321 --> 00:23:06,664
This way please.

300
00:23:23,807 --> 00:23:24,835
Just got back from work, bro?

301
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:27,892
Yeah.

302
00:23:28,464 --> 00:23:28,921
Already finished.

303
00:23:30,235 --> 00:23:31,064
Are you alright, bro?

304
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:32,950
I'm fine.

305
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:33,978
I'm ok.

306
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,150
Well, why did you pretend like
you didn't notice me?

307
00:23:38,892 --> 00:23:41,464
No, who would do that?

308
00:23:45,807 --> 00:23:48,378
I thought you saw me,
but you act like you didn't?

309
00:23:51,378 --> 00:23:52,664
If I really saw you, I would say hi.

310
00:23:53,435 --> 00:23:54,660

Dr. Phathit! Let's go to the clinic.

314

Let's go.

315
00:24:33,864 --> 00:24:36,864
- Shall we go now?
- Come on. Quick!

telling him to submit the assignment?

319

Hello, Prem.

327

- Alright.

It is alright. I just arrived.

Why didn't you call me?

It's fine.

335
00:31:22,892 --> 00:31:24,150
Sure.

336
00:31:25,007 --> 00:31:25,778
Well...

337
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:30,207
Here is the updated data
from last time, right?

338

Yes.

339
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:34,207
- We should proceed in the this way.
- Alright.

340
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,550
Ok.

341
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:40,378
- Thank you very much. It's my pleasure.
- You're welcome.

342

But I want to thank you anyway.

348
00:32:24,721 --> 00:32:26,407
Thank you
for continuing to run this clinic.

349
00:32:30,921 --> 00:32:31,807
I'm willing to do so.

350
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,378
I'm willing to wait for you
as I have been doing.

351
00:32:38,492 --> 00:32:39,807
The reason
you are operating this clinic...

352
00:32:42,435 --> 00:32:43,921
It's not because we are friends, right?

353
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,235
Yes.

354
00:32:47,807 --> 00:32:50,664
I invested
because I knew what you can do.

355
00:32:54,378 --> 00:32:55,064
Sure?

356
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:57,464
Not really!

357
00:32:59,464 --> 00:33:01,207
I'm kidding.

358
00:33:02,171 --> 00:33:04,428
You already forgot
that I'm a business man?

359
00:33:05,664 --> 00:33:08,492
Every time I decide to invest in something,

360
00:33:09,607 --> 00:33:11,150
I always see key to success.

361
00:33:12,092 --> 00:33:13,064
I'm glad.

362

I'm glad that we're still friends.

363
00:33:18,407 --> 00:33:19,321
I know.

364
00:33:20,235 --> 00:33:23,550
Even I expect more than that,
but it’s alright.

365
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:25,750
Whatever.

366
00:34:12,464 --> 00:34:13,378
Not today.

367
00:34:15,092 --> 00:34:15,692
Alright.

368

happens to lonely people anyway.

And this didn't happen just to you.

372
00:34:42,607 --> 00:34:43,950
From now on...

373
00:34:46,321 --> 00:34:47,750
we should act like we don’t
know each other anymore.

374
00:34:51,378 --> 00:34:52,007
What's wrong?

375
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,607
Patis knew everything about us.

376
00:35:10,778 --> 00:35:11,264
What if...

377
00:35:12,692 --> 00:35:14,121
the doctor didn't know about this,

378
00:35:15,235 --> 00:35:16,750
would you still want to get to know me?

379
00:35:30,692 --> 00:35:31,410
Nevermind.

380
00:35:33,721 --> 00:35:34,721
I didn't mind anyway,

381
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,892
We are just like a cigarette.

382
00:35:39,521 --> 00:35:41,864
If you want to smoke, you just smoke.

383
00:35:42,835 --> 00:35:45,864
If we want to quit, you quit.

384
00:35:50,635 --> 00:35:51,435
I understand everything.

385
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:57,721
I'm sorry.

386
00:36:00,178 --> 00:36:01,664
Why do you keep saying sorry?

387
00:36:06,807 --> 00:36:07,807
Because I really feel sorry.

388
00:37:04,235 --> 00:37:07,750
Dena, have you ever liked someone?

389
00:37:14,864 --> 00:37:15,721
I have.

390
00:37:18,121 --> 00:37:20,035
But there are many guys like me too.

391
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:22,721
Do you see how beautiful I am?

392
00:37:27,807 --> 00:37:30,664
What about you? Last time we talked,

393
00:37:32,378 --> 00:37:33,178
are you sure about it?

394
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,178
Not yet.

395
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:43,635
I am not even sure if it's called love.

396
00:37:48,635 --> 00:37:51,350
Ryou, you are a smart guy,

397
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,264
But sometimes
you are so stupid.

398
00:38:34,978 --> 00:38:35,835
Come on. Let's get in the car.

399
00:39:20,835 --> 00:39:21,978
Not romantic at all.

400
00:39:26,378 --> 00:39:27,892
You want this to be romantic?

401
00:39:30,007 --> 00:39:31,950
There should at least be some stars?

402
00:39:39,864 --> 00:39:41,378
How can I stop being stupid?

403
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:47,207
You have to
stop thinking with your brain,

404
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,835
use your feelings
and listen to your heart more.

405
00:39:53,578 --> 00:39:56,035
You are so professional at this stuff.

406
00:39:57,464 --> 00:39:59,064
Why don’t you have a boyfriend then?

407
00:40:05,664 --> 00:40:08,321
Actually, I like someone.

408
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,578
But I think he doesn't like me back.

409
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:16,978
Who's that?

410
00:40:18,264 --> 00:40:22,150
Who would overlook such a
beautiful young lady in our group.

411
00:40:25,378 --> 00:40:26,121
It was you.

412
00:40:32,092 --> 00:40:33,178
I like you, Ryo.

413
00:40:40,778 --> 00:40:41,950
Are you kidding me?

414
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,064
It’s true.

415
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:13,578
Thanks.

416
00:41:48,178 --> 00:41:49,092
Dena…

417
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,750
I am sorry.

418
00:41:56,778 --> 00:41:58,292
You are my best friend.

419
00:42:00,578 --> 00:42:02,492
I only think of you as a friend.

420
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:16,721
I think I can see the stars now.

421
00:42:38,321 --> 00:42:41,607
My back hurts, I think
I should go for a walk.

422
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:15,292
What if the doctor
didn't know about this,

423
00:43:15,464 --> 00:43:17,064
would you still want to get to know me?

424
00:44:41,321 --> 00:44:47,235
(Ryou: Want you to be here with me.)

425
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:10,650
(Ryou: Want you to be here with me.)

426
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:24,464

each other. You are my best friend.)

Go ahead.

430
00:49:39,864 --> 00:49:43,407
I keep telling you about
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs,

431
00:49:43,721 --> 00:49:46,492
that I forgot to let you know
the rules for this magic store.

432
00:49:47,092 --> 00:49:50,207
You will only get one wish.

433
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:52,350
Once your wish has been granted.

434
00:49:53,064 --> 00:49:56,664
The key on my neck
will turn a copper color,

435
00:49:57,235 --> 00:49:58,664
which means...

436
00:49:59,092 --> 00:50:01,121
it is about time for this cafe

437
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:03,521
to set me free.

438
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:05,492
As I said,

439
00:50:06,064 --> 00:50:10,292
Some people can never be pleased
with what they get.

440
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:12,064
When you get into something,

441
00:50:12,664 --> 00:50:15,092
you always hope it's more.

442
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:17,864
According to the cafe rules,

443
00:50:26,464 --> 00:50:28,950
I think
I’m heading back to the USA soon.

444
00:50:29,635 --> 00:50:30,407
When?

445
00:50:31,721 --> 00:50:32,521
In a couple days.

446
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:36,464
You would be able to make one more wish.

447
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:38,407
But,

448
00:50:38,807 --> 00:50:45,664
you have to stay in this cafe forever
until all the keys turn into copper.

449
00:50:46,035 --> 00:50:47,664
Does it sound easy?

450
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:50,778
I'm telling you now that it’s not!

451
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,150
Oh! Good morning, sir.

452
00:50:55,807 --> 00:50:56,721
Good morning, Thana.

453
00:50:57,235 --> 00:50:58,150
You came early again.

454
00:50:58,905 --> 00:51:02,734
Thanks for coming to help
even though it is your holiday.

455
00:51:03,207 --> 00:51:04,150

for your safety,

There will be a loud alarm
when you drive out of the lane.

However, if this bothers you.

467
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:06,378
- You can...
- Can you stop talking about the car?

468
00:53:11,921 --> 00:53:13,264
Why don’t you tell me
that you want to buy a new car?

469
00:53:15,264 --> 00:53:15,978
No, I don't.

470
00:53:17,321 --> 00:53:18,350
I'm not getting a new car.

471
00:53:21,092 --> 00:53:22,407
I want to buy this car for you.

472
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:31,170
I'm sorry.

473
00:53:32,407 --> 00:53:33,950
Stop saying that you're sorry.

474
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:36,892
It won’t help.

475
00:53:39,807 --> 00:53:41,035
The thing that happened,

476
00:53:43,292 --> 00:53:44,864
does that make you
feel less love for me?

477
00:53:46,321 --> 00:53:48,035
I've never loved you any less.

478
00:53:51,264 --> 00:53:52,550
I was just devastated.

479
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:32,350
If I could make you forget
about what happened,

480
00:54:32,835 --> 00:54:34,750
- would we be the same?
- Impossible.

481
00:54:38,007 --> 00:54:40,050

that could help me forget?

It's interesting that...

495
00:56:08,464 --> 00:56:10,921
your boyfriend can see this cafe.

496
00:56:16,178 --> 00:56:17,150
What's your name again?

You both got a wish
from this cafe already.

501
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:56,092
What exactly does that mean?

502
00:56:56,692 --> 00:56:57,607
You've got a wish?

503
00:56:59,150 --> 00:56:59,692
I...

504
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:02,435
have seen this kind of cafe before.

505
00:57:03,635 --> 00:57:04,664
But it wasn't here.

506
00:57:06,178 --> 00:57:06,921
Back then, I was still young

507
00:57:07,807 --> 00:57:09,150
so I made a wish.

508
00:57:34,178 --> 00:57:36,730
You're ready to make a wish now?

509
00:58:03,921 --> 00:58:07,350
I wish Mai Thana Saengsubsiri...

510
00:58:08,207 --> 00:58:09,664
loved me with all his heart.

511
00:58:27,578 --> 00:58:29,035
I didn't think you would come back.

512
00:58:29,835 --> 00:58:31,178
I would come back.

513
00:58:38,492 --> 00:58:39,664

514

00:59:25,092 --> 00:59:25,435
Well...

522
00:59:27,635 --> 00:59:28,950
Can you forgive me then?

523
00:59:35,578 --> 00:59:37,292
I also want to forget what happened,

524
00:59:40,435 --> 00:59:41,492
but I couldn't.

525
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:44,530
If you forgive me,

526

The two of us will be the same as before.

527

If we break up now

532
01:00:27,978 --> 01:00:29,635
and allow each other
to consider ourselves,

533
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:34,250
we might find a way to come back.

534
01:00:36,378 --> 01:00:37,321
But not now...

535
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:42,978
I still couldn't forget
about what happened.

536
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:48,250
Then...

537
01:00:51,121 --> 01:00:52,635
can I hug you

538
01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:57,050
for one last time?

539
01:00:59,607 --> 01:01:00,435

You can't take anyone's life,
even your own.

555
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:53,464
No.2.

556
01:04:54,121 --> 01:04:58,550
The customer will forget about you,
but you remember them.

557
01:04:59,121 --> 01:05:00,550
And No.3.

558
01:05:01,193 --> 01:05:03,993
When all the keys

559
01:05:04,607 --> 01:05:06,292
turn into copper,

560
01:05:07,378 --> 01:05:10,178
you will be able to make one last wish.

561
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:13,521
Then this cafe...

562
01:05:13,664 --> 01:05:14,692
will disappear.

563
01:05:15,635 --> 01:05:17,892
Or there will be
someone to take over it.

564
01:05:18,521 --> 01:05:20,035
And if you can succeed,

565
01:05:20,807 --> 01:05:25,235
all of your memories
from this cafe will also be gone.

566
01:05:27,721 --> 01:05:29,150
If I want to make one more wish,

567
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:32,378
what do I need to do?

568
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:38,410
You can...

569
01:05:39,570 --> 01:05:40,921
ask for one more wish.

570
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:43,850
But...

571
01:05:44,435 --> 01:05:46,264
there are some conditions
you need to follow.

572
01:06:03,090 --> 01:06:04,730
Whatever it takes, I'll do it.

573
01:06:06,321 --> 01:06:07,664
Shall we start?

574
01:07:47,064 --> 01:07:50,321
And if you're leaving this cafe,

575
01:07:51,692 --> 01:07:53,435
then you'll forget
about this cafe completely.

576
01:08:09,721 --> 01:08:11,807
Many people said that memories...

577
01:08:12,207 --> 01:08:14,121
are key treasures of our life.

578
01:08:14,986 --> 01:08:16,243
(Bring sandwich to the old house before 9)
There are some people...

579
01:08:16,978 --> 01:08:18,807
(With love, mom)
who would exchange this key treasure

580
01:08:19,407 --> 01:08:21,778
for only one additional wish.

581
01:08:22,835 --> 01:08:23,950
Stupid, right?

582
01:08:24,492 --> 01:08:26,350
But I want to tell you that...

583
01:08:26,978 --> 01:08:28,350
memory...

584
01:08:28,350 --> 01:08:29,692
is a curse.

585
01:08:30,264 --> 01:08:31,807
However, forgetting...

586
01:08:32,235 --> 01:08:33,800
is the final permanent wish.

587
01:08:36,692 --> 01:08:37,721
You're sure

588
01:08:38,078 --> 01:08:39,650
that you want to do this?

589
01:08:44,692 --> 01:08:45,490
I'm sure.

590
01:09:17,835 --> 01:09:19,264
I knew that you would come.

591
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:25,378
I came back to make one more wish.

592
01:09:28,635 --> 01:09:30,635
You already knew the conditions needed
for the second wish.

593
01:09:32,378 --> 01:09:33,092
I would do it.

594
01:09:46,092 --> 01:09:47,610
I want to know,

595
01:09:50,178 --> 01:09:51,778
what kind of wish
you are attempting to make?

596
01:09:52,578 --> 01:09:54,464
Why is it so important to you?

597
01:09:57,378 --> 01:09:57,750
I...

598
01:10:00,664 --> 01:10:03,121
I wish I could see my son once again.

599
01:10:18,092 --> 01:10:19,490
It seems worthwhile.

600
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:22,750
Please

601
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:24,750
I'm begging you.

602
01:10:56,607 --> 01:10:58,970
I wish I could see my son once again.

603
01:11:55,970 --> 01:11:57,778
(Bring sandwich to old house before 9)
(With love, mom)

604
01:11:58,664 --> 01:12:01,607
I made you sandwich,
don’t forget to eat.

605
01:12:02,321 --> 01:12:04,350
Don't forget to write me a letter.

606
01:12:10,835 --> 01:12:11,530
You...

607
01:12:15,178 --> 01:12:16,150
You...

608
01:12:17,492 --> 01:12:18,550
are my mom,

609
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:20,550
right?

610
01:12:38,464 --> 01:12:41,407
I miss you. I miss you so much.

612
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:13,807
If wishing for Ryou to love me
is not possible,

613
01:13:14,121 --> 01:13:17,064
I wish no one would ever remember Dena.

614
01:13:17,064 --> 01:13:19,060
Ryo, Mai, and Nack.

615
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:23,150
Instead, they would remember
only Darin, Phathit, Thana, and Naphat.

616
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:34,410
(THE CROWN)

617
01:13:55,241 --> 01:13:56,184
Did you forget something, sir?

618
01:14:13,864 --> 01:14:18,750
Um... where is the lady
who owned this cafe?

619
01:14:20,521 --> 01:14:21,692
She is no longer here.

620
01:14:23,441 --> 01:14:25,041
And this cafe
can not give you anymore wishes.

621
01:14:30,378 --> 01:14:30,921
Alright.

622
01:14:33,178 --> 01:14:33,950
Thank you.

623
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:39,492
But if you're feeling sad

624
01:14:40,864 --> 01:14:41,490
or lonely,

625
01:14:42,721 --> 01:14:44,207
I want you to come here

626
01:14:44,721 --> 01:14:45,770
and share your sadness with me.

627
01:14:48,264 --> 01:14:49,064
Share it with you?

628
01:14:51,692 --> 01:14:52,350
Yes.

629
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:57,064
Why do you look so familiar?

630
01:15:02,121 --> 01:15:03,607
We might have seen each other before

631
01:15:05,492 --> 01:15:06,292
somewhere.

632
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:19,150
Let’s take a photo.

633
01:15:43,807 --> 01:15:45,807
- Who said it would turn out good?
- Why is that?

634
01:15:53,150 --> 01:15:55,121
Doesn't look good at all.

635
01:16:44,892 --> 01:16:46,664
Can I come here to see you everyday?

636
01:16:55,578 --> 01:16:56,692
Of course.

637
01:17:11,850 --> 01:17:19,690
(The Luminous Solution)
Can I forget you? I really want to forget.

638
01:17:20,350 --> 01:17:21,778
Forget everything.

639
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:26,321
Even if I wanted to, I can't.

640
01:17:26,578 --> 01:17:29,578
Forget everything.

641
01:17:29,692 --> 01:17:31,092
Enough already.

642
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:33,321
It's over.

643
01:17:33,492 --> 01:17:36,121
Forget already.

644
01:17:36,578 --> 01:17:39,607
Can I forget?

645
01:17:51,035 --> 01:17:52,464
I just want to forget

646
01:17:52,635 --> 01:17:55,921
the memories that I still hold tightly.

647
01:17:56,150 --> 01:17:59,807
Erase your image from my heart.

648
01:17:59,921 --> 01:18:04,207
Please let me forget, let me forget.

649
01:18:04,692 --> 01:18:06,807
I just want to forget,

650
01:18:06,921 --> 01:18:10,035
how long must I remember?

651
01:18:10,264 --> 01:18:12,978
Like a curse that makes me forget

652
01:18:13,035 --> 01:18:17,064
you last.

653
01:18:20,435 --> 01:18:22,321
Can I forget you,

654
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:24,492
I just want to forget.
