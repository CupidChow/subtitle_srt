00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:18,400
(The Luminous Solution)
(Episode 1)

2
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,160
Do you believe in magic?

3
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,200
Mystical powers that alter destiny

4
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:50,720
replacing sorrow with delight
and despair with aspiration.

5
00:02:54,712 --> 00:02:58,851
Does eating this mean I can make a wish?

6
00:02:59,336 --> 00:03:01,148
Yes.

7
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,920
But be aware nothing come without a price,
every gain has its cost.

8
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,920
And so it is with magic,
when you receive it.

9
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,400
Once you have a harvest.

10
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,920
You must offer something in exchange.

11
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,880
That is the first rule.

12
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,680
Babe, can we do it next time?

13
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:37,040
Let's do it now. You
just lie down and I'll do it.

14
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,240
But I was working all
night, I feel exhausted.

15
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,920
Well, that's why I said I'll handle it.

16
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,840
I really can't

17
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,840
I need more sleep.

18
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,880
Please please please...

19
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,880
You are not listening to me,
I am extremely exhausted.

20
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,480
You calling me because
you've arrived already, right?

21
00:06:56,591 --> 00:07:00,911
I've been here for a while now
and the weather is good.

22
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,200
You should come too.

23
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,720
Hey, you and dad have chosen
to go on my first day of school.

24
00:07:07,824 --> 00:07:09,344
If I don't go to school
from the very first day

25
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,240
I won't be able to make new friends.

26
00:07:11,344 --> 00:07:13,104
You can still change your mind.

27
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,200
I can deduct money from your allowance.

28
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,800
Ohhh Mom, enough.

29
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,600
you leave me here and you
still wanted to take away money?

30
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,560
When will you return?

31
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,600
Okay, mom, I'll call you later.

32
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,080
What?

33
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,120
You crashed into me;
all my stuff broke.

34
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,760
Can you move, I'll pick it up.

35
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,120
It's a minibus dude!

36
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,280
If you want to have more space,
why don't you take a taxi?

37
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,840
Hey, you bumped into me,
isn't there an apology?

38
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,760
Clumsy.

39
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,400
Ouch!

40
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,160
What!

41
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,120
What do we have today?

42
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,960
Just like before, you can wait there.

43
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,160
Thank you.

44
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,640
There you go,

45
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,560
this is for you.

46
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,114
(Where are you, doctor?)

47
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,480
Err babe, there's an
emergency case at the clinic

48
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,040
I need to head over there.

49
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,160
What would you like to have
for dinner tonight?

50
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,480
Umm, tonight I won't be able to
make it for dinner.

51
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,720
You can go ahead and
fix yourself something to eat

52
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,160
and I'll grab something on my own.

53
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,720
I'll see you later.

54
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,040
Hey! Ryou.

55
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,200
Hi!

56
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,320
What happened with your project?

57
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,840
I thought you already put
glue on it last night.

58
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,640
Yes,

59
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,360
but that idiot crashed into me,

60
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,440
and he stepped on my
finger while I was picking up.

61
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,760
What the hell!

62
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,240
Who?

63
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,520
Him.

64
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,960
Don't worry, I'll help.

65
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,240
Let's go, we don't want to be late.

66
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,280
Umm okay.

67
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,640
Ryou, struggling with the work?

68
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,840
I thought I gave you enough time to work.

69
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,440
Teacher, I dropped my work this morning

70
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,440
after being bumped into.

71
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,240
Please redo it.

72
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,440
Excuse me, mr. Chanchai.

73
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,360
Yes, Ms. Savitre.

74
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,840
I have the pleasure of introducing
your new student

75
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,360
but now I must depart.

76
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,680
Thank you very much, ms. Savitre.

77
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,110
You're welcome.

78
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,880
Everyone, so today we
have a new friend here.

79
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,240
Introduce yourself, please?

80
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,880
Hello, my name is Mai.

81
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,800
That's sharp introducing.

82
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,880
Mai just joined us in the middle of term.

83
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,520
Let's extend a warm
welcome to our new classmate.

84
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,080
Oh, right.

85
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,680
Ryou, I would like to assign Mai to
collaborate with you on the pending project.

86
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,680
But, teacher, he...

87
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,480
No excuse. This is an order.

88
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,160
Yes.

89
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:05,009
You can sit over there.

90
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,320
Please do it again.

91
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,320
Next one.

92
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,480
You did it so stylishly,
just like I described.

93
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,120
Yes, indeed.

94
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:28,800
- Look at your window and
this staircase. They look real!

95
00:12:28,942 --> 00:12:29,440
- You're right.

96
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,240
- You did an amazing job!

97
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,920
Ah um! Mr.Thana,
are you done with your work?

98
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,640
Note and Saknin gave me their work

99
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,200
so I don't have time for my own.

100
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,760
So what's the difference between.

101
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,720
"Drink then Siz" and "Drink then zling."

102
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,120
Don't you understand
the moment of "Sizzling"?

103
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,240
Like, when you wake in the morning.

104
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,120
I'm a morning person.

105
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,720
No no no no no no,
you don't understand, not at all.

106
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,680
What's wrong with you,

107
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:38,280
I guess if you present this work to Jo,
it's not gonna work.

108
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,760
Hey everyone.

109
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,640
Can we all gather for
a quick meeting right now?

110
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,920
And you too!

111
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,063
(What's the reason for this meeting?)

112
00:14:09,088 --> 00:14:11,880
Everyone is here, right?

113
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,680
I'll get to the point

114
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,720
the company's performance
this year hasn't been great,

115
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,480
and in order to guarantee
the company's survival,

116
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,200
a strategy must be implemented
to decrease the workforce by 30%.

117
00:14:27,087 --> 00:14:28,407
But don't worry,

118
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,920
if anyone is willing to resign,

119
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,000
the company will provide compensation.

120
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,440
Otherwise, we'll have to resort to layoffs.

121
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,960
Hope everyone understands.

122
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,520
So I ask some people to leave,
hoping that everyone can understand.

123
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,840
Excuse me, here's the morning case
report for your review.

124
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,120
Please come in Ms.Phen.

125
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,800
I have some snacks for you, Doctor.

126
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,240
I noticed that you haven't eaten
anything since this morning.

127
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,040
Thank you so much Ms.Phen.

128
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,160
You take the call.

129
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,320
(Thana's calling.)

130
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,920
Umm, maybe next time.

131
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,680
I'm sorry, but I think I
may be interrupting you.

132
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:15,761
I'm happy to see you

133
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,840
and it's my pleasure to have
you taking care of me.

134
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,160
Thank you for all you do.

135
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,080
I was wondering how your work is
coming along. Is everything going well?

136
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,960
Things are going well, it feels like the same
kind of work I was doing during my placement.

137
00:16:27,126 --> 00:16:28,926
No, it's not quite the same.

138
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,040
You're a Resident now,

139
00:16:31,152 --> 00:16:33,472
which means you have additional
responsibilities to handle.

140
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,880
I suppose you're right,

141
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,560
but I can still be your younger brother.

142
00:16:42,664 --> 00:16:44,384
If you need someone to talk to,
please don't hesitate to come to me.

143
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,040
Sure,

144
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,160
but I also want to remind you

145
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,400
that taking care of your personal life
is just as important as your work.

146
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,072
You're doing an amazing job here,

147
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,640
but it's important to take a break
and spend time with your loved ones too.

148
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,320
You deserve to have a
good work-life balance.

149
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,440
Okay, I'll call him back,

150
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,080
Thanks again ms. Phen.

151
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,760
Well, I don't want to take up
any more of your time.

152
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,400
I'll excuse myself now.

153
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,760
Alright.

154
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:04,080
May I...

155
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,040
No.

156
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,880
You can eat your own.

157
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,320
Take it from Nack,

158
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,520
he got a lot of pork in his meal.

159
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,040
Nack, give it to me.

160
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,440
Take a look.

161
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,120
Take it, mine is tasteless.

162
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,120
I haver hardly any, look at it.

163
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,000
You must be hungry.

164
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,240
Hey, Mai, come on have a seat.

165
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,480
Why did you invite him?

166
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,487
Don't be rude, he's new here.

167
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,160
Take a seat, I'm Dena, that is Nack.

168
00:18:34,185 --> 00:18:36,625
This is Ryou, we're in the same classroom.

169
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,800
Umm, I knew it.

170
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,040
So, arrogant.

171
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,880
Hey, Nack how many
times I have to tell you,

172
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,800
if you don't like onion
give it to me, I'll take it.

173
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,720
Do you want more,

174
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,760
I buy it for you.

175
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,360
No thank you, this is enough.

176
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,960
How can you eat it? I'm going to throw up.

177
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,520
Its smell is making me sick to death.

178
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,040
Even Nack, who can eat anything,
doesn't like it.

179
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,320
You should think twice about eating it.

180
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,040
It's not that bad, you
guys are bullying me.

181
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,480
Fine, you take it.

182
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,320
I tease you because you're so easygoing,

183
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,000
So rude!!

184
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,120
Why are you looking at me?

185
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:40,080
Umm "YOU" what is it's about,
I mean the project.

186
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,960
It's the project that "YOU" broke.

187
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,880
Sorry.

188
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,280
It's too late to apologize.

189
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,240
Did you hear that?

190
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,135
Are you actually sorry,
or are you just pretending to be?

191
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,920
I really feel sorry, so I said it.

192
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,120
Why don't you say it nicely?

193
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,680
I just said it, and you already heard it.

194
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:11,640
Enough!! Stop fighting.

195
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:14,071
But he started first.

196
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,080
You started it.

197
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,680
What do you want, you
wanna fight, I'm ready,

198
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,480
let turn this cafeteria into a boxing ring.

199
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,000
Ryou, come on over, okay?

200
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,360
Couldn't agree more.

201
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,680
-Alright, calm down. - Hit back, please.

202
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,080
Nack, this doesn't concern you.

203
00:20:29,215 --> 00:20:31,855
I'll go up on stage
and let's see who's brave enough

204
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,680
to fight with a beautiful girl like me

205
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,920
- I'm the one.
- Me too.

206
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,760
Hey, do you love me any less?

207
00:20:38,896 --> 00:20:40,256
Why are you being like this?

208
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,760
You don't love me anymore, do you?

209
00:20:41,911 --> 00:20:45,311
What the hell, where is that bold girl...

210
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,600
Love me love you? What the hell...

211
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,000
You don't love me anymore, do you?

212
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,240
Why? Am I not pretty enough, my boo?

213
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,800
Stop!! Give me your food.

214
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,480
Noooooo.

215
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,400
Hey, are you not eating?

216
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,560
I noticed you've been pushing your food
around for a while now.

217
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:27,392
How are you able to eat?

218
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,040
The company is firing 30% of the employees,

219
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,880
and I'm not sure
if we'll be able to make it through.

220
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,760
If even creative people
like you can't make it,

221
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:39,247
there's no hope for an AE like me.

222
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,320
If we get fired,

223
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,840
what are your plans for moving forward?

224
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,880
I haven't made any plans yet.

225
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,960
I've been working here
since I graduated from university.

226
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,480
I started working at the same time as you.

227
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,720
If I get fired, I'll have
to be a housewife and

228
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:13,640
take care of my child and husband.

229
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,360
Taking care of my husband
is the right thing to do.

230
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,680
Wait a minute, Ying.

231
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,640
What's the matter, Mr. Nosh.

232
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,080
As for being a housewife, that's up to you,

233
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,800
but what about your child?

234
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,440
Have you found a husband yet?

235
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,440
Oh yeah, I forgot I don't
have a husband yet.

236
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,920
Before worrying about others,
shouldn't you worry about yourself first?

237
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,000
Thana's boyfriend is a doctor,
so even if he quits his job,

238
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,560
he still has enough money
to spend comfortably.

239
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,760
His money isn't my money, Mr. Nosh.

240
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:46,079
So, what will you you do if get laid off?

241
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,360
Aren't you already living together? I
heard he's gonna run his own clinic.

242
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,720
I don't think they'd be heartless to fire me. How
about you guys? What if both of you get laid off?

243
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,640
I don't believe they would
heartlessly lay me off.

244
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,360
Well, if I do get fired,
I might just take the money

245
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,960
and move to another province

246
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,600
to start growing mushrooms
and raising chickens for a living.

247
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,440
Oh, really?

248
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,560
Everyone, we have a
new friend joining us today,

249
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,320
introduce yourself to your friends.

250
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,240
Hi, I'm Mai.

251
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,000
Nack, you're in the same room
with the new kid

252
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,800
show him around.

253
00:23:41,592 --> 00:23:43,752
For practice schedules
and athlete's rules,

254
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,360
you can ask Nack about it.

255
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,120
Thanks.

256
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,280
Alright, everyone,
get ready and let's meet outside.

257
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,000
Yeah!

258
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,960
Hey, the locker over there is available,
you can use it.

259
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,840
Oh, thank you. My name is Mai.

260
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,640
Umm, I'm Koon.

261
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,320
Are you guys done talking?

262
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,080
Let's go.

263
00:24:15,591 --> 00:24:16,831
Let's go.

264
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,240
Mai is really good,
his skills are worth the scholarship.

265
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,280
He's mediocre.

266
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,000
Over actiing.

267
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,240
Who?

268
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,280
It's Mai, your new friend.

269
00:26:11,456 --> 00:26:15,656
Ahh! You said he's mediocre and overacting,

270
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,600
but I saw you eyeing him.

271
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,120
I just don't like him, he ruined my project

272
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,960
and he stepped on my finger.

273
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,240
I'm leaving now.

274
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,760
Wait for me.

275
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,520
(Pathit's calling)

276
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:53,960
Hello.

277
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,240
Why answer so fast?

278
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,640
Because I'm missing you.

279
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,880
Aww, you're totally overacting!

280
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,200
We've only been apart
for less than 4 hours!

281
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,920
It's been 4 whole hours,

282
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,120
and you also called back late.

283
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,640
Aww, I was busy.

284
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,840
I know.

285
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:15,720
Are you mad at me from this morning?

286
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,240
No I'm not upset.

287
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,600
I am so sorry, I try my best,

288
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,160
please go easy on me.

289
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,600
Do you know why am I upset with you?

290
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:36,840
Is it because I refused
to have sex this morning?

291
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,000
Nope, not that.

292
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:44,200
So, what is it that's
making you upset then?

293
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,080
The issue is that you went to work
without having breakfast.

294
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,360
Oh! I see.

295
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,840
You are a doctor,

296
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,640
you take care many patients,

297
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,080
don't forget to take care of yourself too.

298
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,320
Sir yes sir.

299
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,880
Babe, I'm sorry

300
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,240
but I have to end our call now.

301
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,000
I need to leave for work.
I'll see you tonight though.

302
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,160
Okay.

303
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,320
"Babe, I'm sorry but I
have to end our call now.

304
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,560
I need to leave for work.
I'll see you tonight though"

305
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,040
Such an adorable conversation

306
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,280
It's just lovebird
things, unlike you...

307
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,160
who seems to use more charming language
when you flirt with the nurse.

308
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,280
Don't say it lound.

309
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,520
Tried?

310
00:28:37,527 --> 00:28:40,167
Try this.

311
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:45,320
Try it, you'll feel Sizzling.

312
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,760
Stop it! Ying.

313
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,440
Still don't have any ideas right?

314
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,200
Your Sizzling.

315
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,400
Can I ask you something?

316
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,640
Do you think my slogan is not that good?

317
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,920
I have no idea..

318
00:29:13,063 --> 00:29:15,183
It's just strange.

319
00:29:15,831 --> 00:29:17,351
What is strange?

320
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,600
Dude, I don't know, my job is to sell,

321
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,800
but your is to think, right?

322
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,360
Ying,

323
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,120
Yes

324
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,680
bring me a summer package
from the customer in 30 minutes.

325
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,200
Within half an hour, okay.

326
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,520
Yes Boss.

327
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,600
Thana

328
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,560
meet me at my office.

329
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,800
Sizz ling...

330
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,400
riding horse sparking,

331
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:13,200
sip it sizzling, sizzling.

332
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,840
Sizz ling...

333
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,160
are you sure about this idea?

334
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,960
Please let me know if you want
any change for this campaign.

335
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,880
If I ask you to make changes,

336
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,400
are you sure you will be able to do it?

337
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,640
I had to think everything out
for the last campaign.

338
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,600
You made the same mistake
even after redoing it.

339
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,120
I apologize, boss. It won't happen again.

340
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,480
This sentence again,

341
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,280
This is not the first time
you've made a mistake.

342
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,240
You need to be more careful,

343
00:30:47,344 --> 00:30:50,664
especially since our
product targets 12-year-olds.

344
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,680
Can we use the word 'sizzling'?

345
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,520
Do you think you sell sex stimulant drugs?

346
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,080
I am so sorry.

347
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:09,896
Let me put it this way.

348
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:15,960
As your university senior,
I understand how you feel.

349
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,000
However, as your boss,

350
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:22,560
I think you should consider finding
a new occupation that suits you better.

351
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,240
Regarding the company's suggestion
of providing compensation,

352
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,280
you should think it over.

353
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,960
I will assign everyone to a group of 4,

354
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,160
but if there is anyone left over,
you can group up as 5.

355
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,680
If you already have a group,
please send me the name list.

356
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,800
I will pick the topic for your group.

357
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,080
Let's begin the selection process.

358
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,320
Can I be with you?

359
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,040
I was the one who invited you

360
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,440
I want to be here just because Ryou.

361
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,840
Oh, I see.

362
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,480
Can I be with you guys?

363
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,840
Sure, there's still one spot left

364
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,720
move your chair over here.

365
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,800
Why would you invite him?

366
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,800
Our group has only 3 people anyway.

367
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,360
I'm moving my chair.

368
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:38,335
Why didn't you do that in the first time.

369
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,240
How was I supposed to know?

370
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,840
Use your brain.

371
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,200
Oh. Right

372
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,320
let's write down our name.

373
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,440
(Phathit's calling)

374
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,080
Have you gone back home yet?

375
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,000
I'm on my way back.
Would you like something to eat?

376
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,080
I can stop by and buy it for you.

377
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,040
I probably won't be
going back home tonight.

378
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,720
I have to cover for my friend at the ER.

379
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,000
He asked me to help.

380
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,320
Okay, got it.

381
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,840
Have you eaten yet?

382
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,080
Not yet.

383
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,000
What about you?

384
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,840
Not yet either.

385
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,760
Should I buy something for you
to eat at the hospital?

386
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,560
It's okay, you don't have to.

387
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,640
When you get back home,

388
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,560
you'll be tired, so should find
something for yourself to eat.

389
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,880
Alright then, don't forget
to find something to eat too.

390
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,400
Okay.

391
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,880
What are you looking at?

392
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,920
You're a student,

393
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,000
why do you smoke?

394
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,000
(Useless)

395
00:35:29,112 --> 00:35:33,032
Hey, I just asked. Why
are you cursing at me?

396
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,360
If you didn't hear anything,

397
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,960
it means I didn't curse at you.

398
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,640
(You SHIT)

399
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,400
Did you curse at me?

400
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,800
I didn't hear anything,

401
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,280
so I didn't curse at you.

402
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,840
You asshole, what a load of shit.

403
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,040
(Mom's calling.)

404
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,080
Hey mom, why aren't you sleeping yet?

405
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,600
I can't sleep.

406
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,920
Is there something on your mind?

407
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,360
The lottery ticket didn't win, huh?

408
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,040
It's just...

409
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,960
the house that I mortgaged to pay for your
father's medical bills before he died...

410
00:36:52,056 --> 00:36:55,856
The bank sent a letter saying
they are going to foreclose on it.

411
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,240
I don't know what to do

412
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,480
because I don't have much income
from selling things like before.

413
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:06,294
Moreover, I'm not feeling well these days

414
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,880
and it's hard for me to do anything.

415
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,520
Also, I don't want to ask you for help,

416
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,480
Hmm, I'll take care of it for you.

417
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,680
You were scolding me about it,

418
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,000
but now you do it.

419
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,560
I'm an adult.

420
00:38:26,575 --> 00:38:29,695
This is nothing related to adults.

421
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,680
I smoke because I'm stressed.
Is there a problem?

422
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,920
This is nothing related to stress.

423
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,400
I just want to smoke.

424
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,160
Smoking won't help you get rid of stress.

425
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,240
Here,

426
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,640
take this.

427
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,720
What is it?

428
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,160
Such a noob.

429
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,040
Nube what?

430
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,120
This is a good.

431
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,680
What's good about it?

432
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,520
It's good that you can smoke, obviously.

433
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,200
Then...

434
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,360
I can see that you're stressed,
so I just wanted to help.

435
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,520
I think I'm even more stressed now.

436
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:47,480
Oh, I see. I genuinely want to help.

437
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,360
What's your name? I'm Thana.

438
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,040
I'm Time.

439
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,880
Hey, Mai,

440
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,880
how do you get back?

441
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,000
By minibus.

442
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,960
Where is your place?

443
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:32,600
Hey!! Let go, I'll drop you off.

444
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,040
Alright, we'll see you later.

445
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,600
See you.

446
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,280
( Are you sleeping, Doctor?)

447
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,720
( I just came down from the ward.)

448
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,600
(I miss you, Doctor.)

449
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,280
( I miss my patients too,
but now I have to go to bed.)

450
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,720
(I have to get up at 3 am.)

451
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,920
( Good night, Doctor.)

452
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,240
Babe.

453
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,600
Yes.

454
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,960
I love you.

455
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,680
I know I love you too.

456
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:02,720
Say it again, please. I didn't capture it.

457
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,400
No, that's enough. I'm shy.

458
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,400
Shy of what?

459
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,160
Say it again, please.

460
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:16,920
Okay, I love you.

461
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,960
I'll count to three, 1, 2, 3!!

462
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,040
Shall we go to Thit's house
to do our homework this week?

463
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,560
How about coming to my house?

464
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,960
That sounds good too.

465
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:46,200
You all come to my house too often.

466
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,120
It's nice to have a change of atmosphere.

467
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,360
Then I'll let Mai know, okay?

468
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,720
What's going on?
Can't it just be the three of us?

469
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,480
What's the problem with that?
This is a group assignment, after all.

470
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,160
I just don't like him
from my perspective.

471
00:45:57,295 --> 00:45:59,615
He ruined Ryon's work and stepped on his
hand, and he still refuses to apologize.

472
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:05,320
It's okay. How about homework,
which one, Math or English?

473
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,400
Are you off to work?

474
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,960
Hmm...

475
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:29,160
Alright, focus on your work.

476
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:42,200
I'm feeling quite drained,
I think I need some sleep.

477
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,280
Uh... bab..e...

478
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,520
Ryou, I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

479
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,120
Just let me get my things.

480
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,080
Okay, hurry up.

481
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,480
Come on, I'll help you
collect them together.

482
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,400
That's enough.

483
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,080
- Let's go then.
- I want to go too.

484
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,440
Can you please top up the detail
for this product?

485
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,840
Once done, please send it to my email.

486
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,680
Sure, Mr. Noch.

487
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,040
Bro, can you please scan the work
for this week into the book for me?

488
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,440
It's urgent and Boss Jo requested it.

489
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,200
Sure, Mr. Sakdinil.

490
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,160
Thanks Bro.

491
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:12,760
No problem.

492
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,520
It should done in 10 minutes.

493
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:27,599
Ms. Ladda, can I have 20 more minutes to finish
it and then I will bring it to your table?

494
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,040
It's been a long day, dude.

495
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,960
Yeah, it has.

496
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,520
I'm tired too.

497
00:50:38,647 --> 00:50:40,007
Everyone knows how to put on a facade.

498
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,920
Everyone is all rushing to
finish the work for Boss Jo.

499
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,680
I'm really exhausted.

500
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,080
Is your work almost done?

501
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,320
Nah.

502
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,520
Then, why haven't you gone to do it yet?

503
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,360
I am not going to do it anymore.

504
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,640
I think I'll accept compensation instead.

505
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:09,720
Are you serious?

506
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,640
Yes, I've thought about it.

507
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,080
Ying.

508
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,120
Yes Boss.

509
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,000
We have to talk.

510
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,840
Yes.

511
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,960
(Resignation Letter)

512
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,280
(Resignation Letter)

513
00:52:44,233 --> 00:52:46,833
Mr. Thana, are you sure?

514
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,160
Yes.

515
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:55,800
On the page compensation
agreement you hasn't signed it yet.

516
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,520
Oh, I see.

517
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,200
We are not pressuring you,
just letting you know.

518
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,680
I understand.

519
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,240
(Employee Signature:
Supervisor Signature:)

520
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,040
(Exam Room 1
Dr. Phathit Busirisayan)

521
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,840
What brings you in today?

522
00:53:36,208 --> 00:53:38,608
The doctor needs to ask you, grandmom.

523
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,840
It's just a joke, Doctor.

524
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,960
I've been here so many times,

525
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,200
and you ask the same thing every time.

526
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,480
You seem to be in a good mood today.

527
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,080
Yes, I saw a handsome doctor,

528
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,520
and I'm in a particularly good mood today.

529
00:53:56,768 --> 00:54:01,160
By the way, Doctor, do you have
a girlfriend? I want to ask you out.

530
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,760
Do you mean you want to ask
for your daughter?

531
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,400
No, I mean I want to ask you out.

532
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,720
You really are in a good mood today.

533
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,960
I wish you were in a good
mood like this every day.

534
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:17,840
But let me ask you about the
latest medication that I gave you.

535
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,640
Did you take it as instructed?

536
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:26,080
Sometimes I eat,
and sometimes I forget to eat.

537
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:32,120
Okay, can I ask you to do one thing for me?

538
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,440
I'll arrange for the
medication for next week.

539
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:39,240
Can you promise me that you'll take it all?

540
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,320
Yes, Doctor.

541
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:45,400
And should I continue
taking the old medication?

542
00:54:45,504 --> 00:54:48,784
No need for the old medication.

543
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,240
You can dispose of it.

544
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,160
Just take the medication
that I arrange for you next week.

545
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:55,560
But make sure to take all of it, okay?

546
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,840
Yes, Doctor. Thank you.

547
00:54:59,944 --> 00:55:02,464
Thank you, and take care.

548
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,240
Thank you, Ms. Phen.

549
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,040
- This way, please.
- Goodbye, Doctor.

550
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,480
Goodbye.

551
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,760
This's so good.

552
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,280
This is for you.

553
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:38,800
Oh.

554
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,240
What?

555
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,880
How about me?

556
00:55:46,464 --> 00:55:49,824
What the... you're so biased,
only giving things to Ryou.

557
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,400
You take mine then.

558
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,960
Can I give it to her?

559
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:58,960
Thank you.

560
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,400
Honey milk flavor.

561
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:05,600
Nack, we going to the court,
do you want to join us.

562
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:06,880
Sure,

563
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,920
Ryou do you want to watch me this break?

564
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,520
I'll go.

565
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,920
Maybe next time,

566
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,280
I'll prep the details of project,

567
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,080
it's almost done.

568
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,320
Well I don't want to go.

569
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:23,240
No, you come with me.

570
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,280
Why?

571
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,040
You said you will go,

572
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,520
then go, keep the plate.

573
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,920
- Hurry up, I'll help you carry it.
- Alright.

574
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:29,641
I'll help you carry it.

575
00:56:29,665 --> 00:56:30,880
Let me take care of
the contacting.

576
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,280
Goodbye.

577
00:56:42,967 --> 00:56:44,327
Whose table is that?

578
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,680
It's Mai, the new basketball player.

579
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,960
Maybe he went to practice ball.

580
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,080
But Net is here, though.

581
00:56:53,216 --> 00:56:55,844
Did he enter the wrong classroom
or did he not hear the class bell?

582
00:56:56,282 --> 00:56:57,563
Ryou, could
you go find him, please?

583
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:01,320
I think he's just in one
of the nearby classrooms.

584
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,640
Teacher, may I go with Ryou to find him?

585
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,360
No need, then.

586
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,200
He will go by himself, then.

587
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,280
We should start, turn to page 65.

588
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,360
Why do you imprison me?

589
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,600
Ouch, I'm not the one who did it.

590
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:20,120
I was tasked by the teacher to
find you because you weren't in class.

591
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,200
There's no one here,

592
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,320
who else could it be if not you?

593
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,280
You are dumb!

594
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,400
If I am the one who did it
then why should I reopen it?

595
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,120
Do you think I am going to believe you?

596
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,040
Whether or not to believe me
is your own business.

597
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,600
I think you deserve it.

598
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:19,080
(Phathit)

599
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:29,200
Sorry, the number you
dialed is unavailable.

600
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:32,600
Please have a seat.

601
01:00:40,552 --> 01:00:42,032
May I have a menu please?

602
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,520
Unfortunately, we don't take orders here,

603
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:02,960
but we select a menu
that's suitable for each customer.

604
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:07,200
But I don't usually drink coffee.

605
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,760
Please try it first.

606
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,080
Is it bitter?

607
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:37,120
But what you're experiencing right now i

608
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,960
is even more bitter
than this cup of coffee.

609
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:59,280
Affogato is a vanilla ice cream

610
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:06,160
with a shot of espresso
poured on top of the icecream.

611
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:08,440
You should taste it
and see for yourself.

612
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:59,000
How did you know what I was feeling,

613
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,400
or do you have magic powers?

614
01:03:04,961 --> 01:03:08,401
You look so gloomy.

615
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,600
It's obvious to anyone.

616
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,560
Does it show that much on my face?

617
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,520
Yes.

618
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:30,120
But not everyone can tell.

619
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:48,760
This chocolate cake
will make you feel better.

620
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,080
But I didn't order it.

621
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:57,800
I told you before that we don't
have a menu to order from.

622
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:11,960
Mom.

623
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,400
You scared me!

624
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,560
Don't sneak up on me like that.

625
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,720
How about you?
You came back without telling me.

626
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,120
Dad, Mai is back home.

627
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,320
Oh, you're back.

628
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,280
You came back and it's already dark.

629
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,920
Dad and Mom, please.

630
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,720
You didn't even tell me
you were coming back.

631
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:32,920
I thought I was robbed.

632
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:34,520
What are you saying?

633
01:05:35,151 --> 01:05:37,231
How's the new school,

634
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,760
is it good?

635
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:43,720
It's good.

636
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,040
Then why do you look so gloomy?

637
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:48,240
Is the training here harder than before?

638
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,600
Not really.

639
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:02,080
I got locked in the locker room today.

640
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:08,080
So what? You let them bully you?

641
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,720
Tomorrow, you'll get them back.

642
01:06:10,872 --> 01:06:13,832
As a young man,
you can't just let them do it.

643
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:16,280
Are you scared, Mai?

644
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,240
You seem so sad.

645
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:21,560
I've been worried since the first day.

646
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,080
It's not like that, Mom.

647
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,640
I didn't give in. I already gave it back.

648
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:29,200
That's how it is, son.

649
01:06:29,303 --> 01:06:32,383
But I'm not sure if it was the person
who locked me in.

650
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:36,080
It seems like they
opened the door very easily.

651
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:39,640
Wait, I'm not sure.

652
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,960
But you apologized to him, right?

653
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,440
Uh-oh, things are not looking good.

654
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:47,520
Will we be called to school
by the teacher tomorrow?

655
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:51,760
It's natural for boys to engage in
some roughhousing among themselves.

656
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:55,440
Come on, Mom. Boys
have to fight each other.

657
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:00,200
At most, just say you misunderstood.

658
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:06,760
Did you apologize to him, Mai?

659
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,280
You're going to apologize
to him tomorrow, okay?

660
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,880
Mom, Boys are like this.

661
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,280
Teenagers have to fight
each other. It's normal.

662
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:19,240
Dad. He doesn't even know if the person

663
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,680
who opened the door
was the one who locked him in.

664
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:24,000
Then it's probably the kid
on the basketball team.

665
01:07:24,135 --> 01:07:29,815
You just got there.
They probably took the new kid in the team.

666
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:35,680
Be patient, as a young man,
you have to be patient.

667
01:07:35,776 --> 01:07:37,216
But if you can't take
it, you'll give it back.

668
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:39,040
Okay, Dad.

669
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,440
Alright, kid's mother.

670
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:47,000
Mai, go take a shower and come down to eat.

671
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,240
You should fight back, you know.

672
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,160
Sigh.

673
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,080
They always teach irrelevant things.

674
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,840
Excuse me, check please.

675
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:21,520
We don't accept any money
at our coffee shop.

676
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:26,240
So, how can I pay for it?

677
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,360
One Blessing.

678
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,640
One Blessing.

679
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:38,720
Yes, you can ask me for one blessing.

680
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,680
You must be joking,

681
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:44,120
you let me make a wish,
and that's how I pay?

682
01:08:44,211 --> 01:08:48,200
Shut up, stop asking,
anything you want, just ask for it.

683
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,520
Wait... what... I...

684
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:56,440
I said make a wish.

685
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,720
Alright

686
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,440
but can I just think of it first?

687
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:06,880
Stop negotiating, I said make a wish.

688
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:13,480
Excuse me,

689
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,280
is the shop closed or still open?

690
01:09:48,725 --> 01:09:51,225
(Next Episode)
Hey! Let's have sex.

691
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:52,483
Right here?

692
01:09:53,319 --> 01:09:55,053
What's wrong with you?

693
01:09:55,078 --> 01:09:56,412
Are you still mad at me?

694
01:09:56,437 --> 01:09:58,787
Honestly, I don't care about you.

695
01:09:58,812 --> 01:10:00,647
You really love to guilt trip me.

696
01:10:00,672 --> 01:10:01,834
You should feel guilty.

697
01:10:01,859 --> 01:10:02,952
Where are you going?

698
01:10:02,977 --> 01:10:04,225
Today is Saturday.

699
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:06,954
What do you call people who use
their lovers' money to live? A leech?

700
01:10:06,979 --> 01:10:08,271
Is there a leech here?

701
01:10:08,296 --> 01:10:09,033
Shut up.
