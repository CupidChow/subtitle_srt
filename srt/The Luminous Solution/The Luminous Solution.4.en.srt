- Love leads people into my shop

- I know...

56
00:03:02,773 --> 00:03:03,999
- it sounds funny that

57
00:03:04,436 --> 00:03:07,264
- those people would use their only wish

58
00:03:07,835 --> 00:03:10,235
- to exchange for love and ownership.

- Are you blind to the
love you can't grasp?

62
00:03:20,732 --> 00:03:23,083
- Hurry, open your eyes
and open your heart,

63
00:03:23,457 --> 00:03:28,066
- in case you will see more
than the love that blinds you.

00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:32,861
You look

190
00:17:33,955 --> 00:17:35,017
so exhausted.

191
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:37,927
I’m okay, bro.

192
00:17:40,979 --> 00:17:42,019
Are you sure?

193
00:17:42,526 --> 00:17:43,526
Don’t worry!

194
00:17:44,768 --> 00:17:45,970
This meeting

195
00:17:46,088 --> 00:17:48,221
might change your life forever.

196
00:17:50,674 --> 00:17:51,697
Exactly.

197
00:17:52,323 --> 00:17:53,400
I've been waiting

198
00:17:53,424 --> 00:17:54,751
for this chance for ages.

199
00:17:54,775 --> 00:17:55,845
I’m ready for it.

200
00:17:56,392 --> 00:17:57,478
Good!

201
00:17:58,330 --> 00:17:59,330
Do you know?

202
00:17:59,571 --> 00:18:01,556
Everyone wants this group of investors

203
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,243
to invest and establish a clinic.

204
00:18:03,557 --> 00:18:05,174
You are so lucky.

205
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:07,049
And...

206
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,791
How do you know them?

207
00:18:12,268 --> 00:18:13,268
Who am I?

208
00:18:13,604 --> 00:18:15,345
I'm Dr. Prem, man.

209
00:18:20,963 --> 00:18:21,963
Hurry up!

210
00:18:22,698 --> 00:18:23,698
Thank you!

211
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,031
Hello sir,

212
00:18:31,407 --> 00:18:32,985
may I help you?

213
00:18:33,555 --> 00:18:34,953
I’m here for the job interview.

214
00:18:34,978 --> 00:18:37,196
Yes, my name is Sawitri,

215
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,906
I’m a salesperson here.

216
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,117
Nice to meet you, Ms. Sawitri.

217
00:18:41,438 --> 00:18:42,438
I’m Thana.

218
00:18:42,852 --> 00:18:44,986
Please come this way, Mr. Thana.

219
00:18:45,344 --> 00:18:46,500
Fill out this document

220
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:47,954
and wait a moment.

221
00:18:48,188 --> 00:18:49,188
Yes.

(Thana Saengsubsiri)

223
00:19:11,356 --> 00:19:12,293
Mr. Naphat!

224
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,318
Hello.

225
00:19:13,343 --> 00:19:14,262
Hello, Dr. Prem.

226
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:15,637
This is Dr. Phathit.

227
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:18,559
Hey, dude.

228
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,114
Don’t tell me that

229
00:19:25,715 --> 00:19:26,785
you are the one that.

230
00:19:27,528 --> 00:19:28,809
Dr. Prem talked about?

231
00:19:28,848 --> 00:19:30,379
Surprise?

232
00:19:31,184 --> 00:19:32,384
Are you serious?

233
00:19:33,863 --> 00:19:35,394
Surprise!

234
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:37,465
Do you guys know each other?

235
00:19:37,966 --> 00:19:38,966
Right.

236
00:19:38,991 --> 00:19:40,020
We've been friends

237
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,215
since our school days.

238
00:19:41,661 --> 00:19:42,701
That’s great.

239
00:19:43,263 --> 00:19:44,590
Should we go inside

240
00:19:45,113 --> 00:19:46,387
the meeting room now?

241
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:47,684
This way, Mr. Naphat.

242
00:19:48,661 --> 00:19:49,701
To be honest,

243
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:52,465
you can just call me Naphat.

244
00:19:52,622 --> 00:19:54,075
No way, it's inappropriate.

245
00:19:54,997 --> 00:19:56,200
Come on, let's go.

246
00:19:56,731 --> 00:19:57,731
Naphat.

247
00:19:57,911 --> 00:19:59,293
Phathit. Let's go.

248
00:20:10,981 --> 00:20:11,989
Are you Mr. Thana?

249
00:20:13,473 --> 00:20:14,394
Yes.

250
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:15,873
This way, please.

(BK Import Cars)

252

The kidneys are responsible

253
00:22:21,397 --> 00:22:22,638
for regulating water

254
00:22:22,663 --> 00:22:24,177
and chemicals in our bodies.

255
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:26,599
Get it?

256
00:22:34,172 --> 00:22:35,929
You said you weren't hungry,

257
00:22:35,953 --> 00:22:37,753
so why is your stomach growling?

258
00:22:38,687 --> 00:22:39,991
And who didn't

259
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,975
share that glass of milk with me?

260
00:22:58,354 --> 00:22:59,354
What a mess.

261
00:23:00,284 --> 00:23:01,658
Do you have some snacks?

262
00:23:15,207 --> 00:23:16,207
Oh you...

263
00:23:17,949 --> 00:23:19,105
It's fun teasing you.

264
00:23:21,215 --> 00:23:22,675
But I’m not having fun!

265
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:29,058
Come.

266
00:23:30,402 --> 00:23:31,503
Let me feed you.

267
00:23:31,566 --> 00:23:33,300
- No!
- Your hand got hurt, right?

268
00:23:33,348 --> 00:23:34,425
No!

269
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:35,450
Eat up.

270
00:23:52,475 --> 00:23:53,475
Eat it.

271
00:23:53,795 --> 00:23:54,795
It's yours.

272
00:23:59,361 --> 00:24:00,361
Hey!

273
00:24:02,814 --> 00:24:04,579
Calm down!

274
00:24:04,891 --> 00:24:06,571
Wait, calm down!

275
00:24:08,118 --> 00:24:09,641
I’m not your boyfriend, okay?

276
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:12,032
Sorry. I’m just very happy.

277
00:24:13,376 --> 00:24:14,376
It's fine.

278
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,279
Let’s go back!

279
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:46,490
Will you guys be available tomorrow?

280
00:24:46,928 --> 00:24:47,928
Oh...

281
00:24:48,295 --> 00:24:49,735
Is something wrong?

282
00:24:50,904 --> 00:24:52,794
Let’s go celebrate. Will you come?

283
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:54,833
Oh, you shouldn't have!

284
00:24:55,107 --> 00:24:56,307
You free, dude?

285
00:24:57,201 --> 00:24:58,201
Oh...

286
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:01,013
Yes, I am free.

287
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:04,161
So, you're free?

288
00:25:04,912 --> 00:25:05,912
Yeah.

289
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:06,937
I am free.

290
00:25:07,357 --> 00:25:09,037
So, which place are we going?

291
00:25:09,701 --> 00:25:11,381
Phathit knows the store well.

292
00:25:14,607 --> 00:25:15,607
Then...

293
00:25:15,998 --> 00:25:16,998
See you later.

294
00:25:18,146 --> 00:25:19,146
See you later.

295
00:25:20,334 --> 00:25:21,334
Take care.

296
00:25:24,076 --> 00:25:25,138
See you tomorrow.

297
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,193
See you, Dr. Prem.

298
00:25:27,646 --> 00:25:29,036
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

299
00:25:45,792 --> 00:25:46,948
I don’t understand.

300
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,018
Why don’t you just let me copy?

301
00:25:49,183 --> 00:25:50,729
Thank you.

302
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:52,370
Have you tried reading it?

303
00:25:52,395 --> 00:25:53,916
No. It’s too difficult for me.

304
00:25:56,229 --> 00:25:57,229
Here.

305
00:25:59,573 --> 00:26:01,002
Why did you give me this?

306
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:02,679
Just drink it.

307
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,893
Drinking milk will make you taller.

308
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:17,580
Mai, have you finished

309
00:26:17,605 --> 00:26:19,401
your homework for this afternoon?

310
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,509
I have to practice basketball

311
00:26:21,534 --> 00:26:22,541
this afternoon.

312
00:26:22,566 --> 00:26:23,744
I'll do it later.

313
00:26:24,768 --> 00:26:26,557
We need to submit it this afternoon.

314
00:26:26,582 --> 00:26:27,942
Let’s do it now.

315
00:26:31,964 --> 00:26:32,964
Suit yourself.

316
00:26:34,581 --> 00:26:36,612
I'll submit your homework with mine.

317
00:26:36,854 --> 00:26:37,948
I'll leave it to you.

318
00:26:38,573 --> 00:26:39,885
Oh, hello Mai.

319
00:26:39,956 --> 00:26:41,026
Hi, Nungning!

320
00:26:41,042 --> 00:26:42,174
You're submitting homework?

321
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:44,018
Yes. Want me to submit your homework?

322
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,080
Let's go together.

323
00:26:46,347 --> 00:26:47,674
Wait a moment.

324
00:26:48,588 --> 00:26:49,971
- I'll leave it to you.
- Sure.

325
00:26:53,581 --> 00:26:54,581
Let's go.

326
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,440
Ouch!

327
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:34,815
Feeling better? Doesn't hurt anymore.

328
00:27:37,933 --> 00:27:39,330
It still hurts.

329
00:27:40,252 --> 00:27:42,173
When I'm in pain, my
dad blows on it for me,

330
00:27:42,198 --> 00:27:43,759
and says it's gone,

331
00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:45,698
the pain really goes away.

332
00:27:52,016 --> 00:27:53,235
I love teasing you.

333
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,047
So fun.

334
00:27:56,548 --> 00:27:57,656
I’m so, so happy.

Come and sit,

338
00:28:59,713 --> 00:29:01,516
don't be slow,

339
00:29:01,876 --> 00:29:02,876
come and sit here.

340
00:29:07,298 --> 00:29:08,578
Ryou and Mai,

341
00:29:09,258 --> 00:29:10,406
are you guys flirting?

342
00:29:11,133 --> 00:29:12,688
Oh my...

343
00:29:13,704 --> 00:29:14,704
What flirting?

344
00:29:16,515 --> 00:29:17,524
I was just sleepy.

345
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:19,297
I needed a place to lay down.

346
00:29:20,274 --> 00:29:21,688
Geez,

347
00:29:21,891 --> 00:29:22,828
sure.

348
00:29:22,853 --> 00:29:24,110
Are you so sleepy that

349
00:29:24,135 --> 00:29:25,688
you had to sleep on his lap?

350
00:29:26,751 --> 00:29:27,751
Yeah. Sure.

351
00:29:27,774 --> 00:29:28,961
Whatever you say.

352
00:29:31,344 --> 00:29:33,219
Hey, where are you going?

353
00:29:34,516 --> 00:29:35,758
Nack!

354
00:29:36,555 --> 00:29:37,570
Look at him.

355
00:29:37,594 --> 00:29:38,625
I just dragged him

356
00:29:38,649 --> 00:29:40,257
to start on the project draft.

357
00:29:40,282 --> 00:29:41,328
I'll be right back.

358
00:29:41,337 --> 00:29:42,524
I'll go look after him.

359
00:29:42,727 --> 00:29:44,602
Nack, where are you going?

360
00:30:06,948 --> 00:30:08,510
Are you ready to go to school?

361
00:30:09,417 --> 00:30:11,112
Can I not go to school, Mom?

362
00:30:12,762 --> 00:30:13,762
Oh?

363
00:30:13,823 --> 00:30:14,823
Why?

364
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,831
My friends like to tease me

365
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:17,972
for not having a dad.

366
00:30:39,383 --> 00:30:40,601
If I finish all of it,

367
00:30:41,672 --> 00:30:43,672
will I be able to make a wish?

368
00:30:45,664 --> 00:30:46,664
Sure.

369
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:33,608
I wish that

00:31:34,123 --> 00:31:35,186
my son

371
00:31:36,343 --> 00:31:37,968
will have a better life.

372
00:32:53,117 --> 00:32:54,960
Nack! What’s wrong with you?

373
00:33:03,632 --> 00:33:05,072
You like Ryou, right?

374
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,210
Yeah.

375
00:33:12,592 --> 00:33:13,592
Since when?

376
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,310
I have no idea.

377
00:33:17,154 --> 00:33:18,209
Once I realized it,

378
00:33:18,233 --> 00:33:19,716
I wanted to take care of him.

379
00:33:19,741 --> 00:33:21,310
I wanted to be closer to him.

380
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:23,273
I think I've

381
00:33:24,608 --> 00:33:26,225
liked him for a long time now.

382
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:27,771
And especially now that

383
00:33:27,796 --> 00:33:29,240
he's drifting apart from me,

384
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:31,545
I'm feeling uneasy.

385
00:33:34,241 --> 00:33:35,241
Does Ryou know?

386
00:33:43,006 --> 00:33:44,498
I understand how you feel.

387
00:33:46,084 --> 00:33:49,279
But it’d be better if you told him.

388
00:34:06,721 --> 00:34:08,027
(Thana)

389
00:34:12,355 --> 00:34:13,766
Sorry, the number that you've dialed

390
00:34:13,791 --> 00:34:14,956
cannot be connected...

391
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,654
Still not coming home?

392
00:34:52,561 --> 00:34:53,732
Not yet.

393
00:34:54,897 --> 00:34:56,021
I'll go back in a bit.

394
00:34:58,186 --> 00:34:59,186
Phathit.

395
00:35:00,256 --> 00:35:01,810
If something's on your mind,

396
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,834
you can tell me.

397
00:35:07,459 --> 00:35:08,739
I’m really okay.

398
00:35:11,405 --> 00:35:12,405
You're fine?

399
00:35:12,733 --> 00:35:13,920
You always say that,

400
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,640
then you're off zoning out again.

401
00:35:16,732 --> 00:35:17,857
Is it about the clinic?

402
00:35:19,436 --> 00:35:20,436
No.

403
00:35:21,491 --> 00:35:22,851
If it's about the clinic,

404
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,725
I’m so happy about it.

405
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,475
So, what has made you so down recently?

406
00:35:35,428 --> 00:35:36,468
Family issues.

407
00:35:41,498 --> 00:35:42,498
Trust me,

408
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,054
you guys will make up eventually.

409
00:35:49,623 --> 00:35:50,983
I had better go.

410
00:35:51,491 --> 00:35:52,685
I'm still on the shift.

411
00:35:55,225 --> 00:35:56,225
See ya.

412
00:35:56,733 --> 00:35:57,733
Thanks.

413
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,951
(Call rejected)

414
00:36:13,976 --> 00:36:16,264
(I'm not free at the moment)

415
00:36:38,608 --> 00:36:39,740
Ryou,

416
00:36:39,765 --> 00:36:41,357
Nack has something to tell you.

417
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:45,959
Umm...

418
00:36:48,943 --> 00:36:50,014
Want to grab a bite

419
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:51,234
after school together?

420
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:52,335
My treat.

421
00:36:52,928 --> 00:36:54,131
Sorry,

422
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:56,865
I want to finish next week assignments.

423
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:59,029
So that I can be free next week.

424
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,100
Ryou, they are for next week.

425
00:37:01,733 --> 00:37:03,466
Stop being a nerd for a day, man,

426
00:37:03,827 --> 00:37:05,185
your brain might explode.

427
00:37:07,741 --> 00:37:09,225
But I need to go home early.

428
00:37:09,428 --> 00:37:10,474
My parents will go

429
00:37:10,499 --> 00:37:11,975
to another province tonight.

430
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,520
I'm afraid I'll miss them.

431
00:37:13,717 --> 00:37:15,529
Oh, let's head back together then.

432
00:37:16,272 --> 00:37:18,232
I need to buy something around there.

433
00:37:18,373 --> 00:37:19,865
Sure, let's go.

434
00:37:21,279 --> 00:37:22,318
See you later.

435
00:37:23,186 --> 00:37:24,186
Bye bye.

436
00:37:24,211 --> 00:37:25,250
See you later, dude.

437
00:37:25,612 --> 00:37:26,612
Take care.

438
00:37:31,401 --> 00:37:32,940
Why didn’t you just tell him?

439
00:37:34,995 --> 00:37:36,035
I don’t know.

440
00:38:52,385 --> 00:38:57,479
Why doesn't my heart listen?

441
00:38:59,423 --> 00:39:05,462
Your image keeps spinning in my mind.

442
00:39:08,697 --> 00:39:09,697
Brother!

443
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,384
Not celebrating your job with Doc?

444
00:39:17,025 --> 00:39:18,025
No.

445
00:39:18,962 --> 00:39:20,087
Geez,

446
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:22,548
you should go celebrate

447
00:39:22,962 --> 00:39:24,657
instead of looking sad like this.

448
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,225
What if I take you out

449
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,468
for a celebration?

450
00:39:38,523 --> 00:39:39,523
No.

451
00:39:40,437 --> 00:39:42,296
Don't be so stubborn.

452
00:39:46,929 --> 00:39:47,929
I'm not stubborn.

453
00:39:49,913 --> 00:39:51,147
Just for today, please.

454
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:56,971
Okay, brother.

455
00:40:04,091 --> 00:40:05,091
Then,

456
00:40:05,325 --> 00:40:06,340
I’m going now.

457
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:10,583
Hey, Time.

458
00:40:13,919 --> 00:40:16,004
Thanks again for today.

459
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:40,770
Come in.

460
00:40:40,903 --> 00:40:41,903
Sure.

461
00:40:43,489 --> 00:40:44,746
I'll take off my shoes first.

462
00:40:44,762 --> 00:40:45,762
Sure.

463
00:40:47,364 --> 00:40:48,488
Make yourself at home.

464
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:49,512
Sure.

465
00:41:01,848 --> 00:41:03,020
Mai,

466
00:41:04,309 --> 00:41:05,886
we have something to tell you.

467
00:41:10,731 --> 00:41:12,171
- Yes?
- You see...

468
00:41:14,223 --> 00:41:16,332
We're going to move to another province.

469
00:41:17,895 --> 00:41:19,543
Are you going to stay here alone?

470
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:20,559
Or do you want to

471
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:22,575
start fresh with us up there?

472
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,629
I know that

473
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,278
we just moved here,

474
00:41:29,303 --> 00:41:30,762
so if we were to move again,

475
00:41:30,787 --> 00:41:31,981
it'd probably be hard.

476
00:41:32,575 --> 00:41:34,543
That's why I wanted to ask you first.

477
00:41:35,653 --> 00:41:36,965
If you want to stay here,

478
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,035
we'll find you a dorm.

479
00:41:39,669 --> 00:41:41,129
Don’t worry about the expense.

480
00:41:41,161 --> 00:41:42,281
I’ll manage it.

481
00:41:43,044 --> 00:41:44,244
Just study hard

482
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,020
and fulfill your own duties.

483
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,621
Or do you want to come along with us?

484
00:41:53,098 --> 00:41:54,715
I'll ask grandma to help you

485
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,770
with a new school.

486
00:41:55,794 --> 00:41:56,848
What do you say?

487
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:05,145
Let me think about it.

488
00:42:05,942 --> 00:42:07,481
I'll give an answer later.

489
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,825
Let’s eat.

490
00:42:35,829 --> 00:42:37,047
Just do it.

491
00:42:38,423 --> 00:42:40,356
The noise isn't disturbing me.

492
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:55,438
Here you go.

493
00:42:56,165 --> 00:42:57,165
Thanks.

494
00:43:35,555 --> 00:43:36,766
I like you.

495
00:43:41,954 --> 00:43:43,430
I like you, Ryou.

496
00:43:45,883 --> 00:43:47,414
I've liked you for a long time.

497
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:41,595
Hey...

498
00:44:46,195 --> 00:44:47,195
Nack...

499
00:45:19,113 --> 00:45:20,464
Why don’t you just buy it?

500
00:45:30,433 --> 00:45:31,956
I'm afraid I couldn’t finish it.

501
00:45:38,378 --> 00:45:39,378
I'm sorry.

502
00:45:42,972 --> 00:45:44,012
It’s alright.

503
00:45:47,113 --> 00:45:48,233
Let’s go home.

504
00:46:14,298 --> 00:46:15,298
Come on.

505
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:17,180
Let's eat.

506
00:46:45,252 --> 00:46:46,252
Is it good?

507
00:46:49,884 --> 00:46:50,884
Absolutely.

508
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,660
Please, eat a lot then.

509
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:56,712
Sure.

510
00:47:04,384 --> 00:47:05,423
By the way...

511
00:47:06,252 --> 00:47:07,252
Yes?

512
00:47:08,494 --> 00:47:10,017
I’ve already found

513
00:47:10,042 --> 00:47:11,493
the investors to help me

514
00:47:11,518 --> 00:47:12,642
with my new clinic.

515
00:47:16,548 --> 00:47:18,407
Good.

516
00:47:18,587 --> 00:47:19,728
Congratulations!

517
00:47:21,017 --> 00:47:22,040
When will it start?

518
00:47:23,267 --> 00:47:24,267
Well...

519
00:47:24,978 --> 00:47:26,782
I think it can start now.

520
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:29,251
Because the funds and the place

521
00:47:29,853 --> 00:47:31,213
are all ready.

522
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:33,587
If there's no problem

523
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,196
then we'll begin right away.

524
00:47:39,179 --> 00:47:40,320
I’m happy for you.

525
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:43,070
Are you alright?

526
00:47:44,265 --> 00:47:45,920
I'm not showing off, you know?

527
00:47:46,124 --> 00:47:47,124
I’m okay.

528
00:47:47,913 --> 00:47:49,033
I understand.

529
00:47:49,819 --> 00:47:51,053
You've been waiting for

530
00:47:51,062 --> 00:47:52,288
this chance for so long.

531
00:47:54,343 --> 00:47:55,343
Besides,

532
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:58,397
I’m really glad for you.

533
00:48:00,062 --> 00:48:01,062
Honestly,

534
00:48:02,201 --> 00:48:03,702
you can come work with me,

535
00:48:05,483 --> 00:48:06,683
if you want to, that is.

536
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:08,577
Actually,

537
00:48:09,257 --> 00:48:10,647
I just got a new job today.

538
00:48:12,577 --> 00:48:13,577
Really?

539
00:48:13,764 --> 00:48:14,764
Yes!

540
00:48:18,163 --> 00:48:19,311
Then

541
00:48:19,889 --> 00:48:21,169
let’s celebrate.

542
00:48:22,272 --> 00:48:23,272
Yeah.

543
00:48:29,145 --> 00:48:31,371
Would you mind grabbing us wine glasses?

544
00:49:00,844 --> 00:49:01,964
For my new job.

545
00:49:03,547 --> 00:49:04,667
For more work.

546
00:49:16,488 --> 00:49:17,707
- By the way...
- By the way...

547
00:49:20,848 --> 00:49:21,888
You go first.

548
00:49:26,059 --> 00:49:27,059
So,

549
00:49:28,278 --> 00:49:29,362
how did you meet

550
00:49:29,387 --> 00:49:30,871
those investors?

551
00:49:32,723 --> 00:49:33,723
Oh...

552
00:49:35,645 --> 00:49:37,114
Brother Prem introduced us,

553
00:49:37,122 --> 00:49:39,051
seems like they know each other.

554
00:49:41,552 --> 00:49:43,020
Guess who they are.

555
00:49:43,645 --> 00:49:44,942
It's a small world.

556
00:49:45,934 --> 00:49:46,934
Who is it?

557
00:49:50,794 --> 00:49:51,794
Naphat.

558
00:49:58,270 --> 00:49:59,310
What’s wrong?

559
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:02,950
Nothing.

560
00:50:04,169 --> 00:50:05,348
Really?

561
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:07,473
You look pretty upset.

562
00:50:10,325 --> 00:50:11,876
It's too much of a coincidence

563
00:50:11,901 --> 00:50:12,991
that he just

564
00:50:13,556 --> 00:50:14,785
invested in your clinic.

565
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:18,705
I think it was just a coincidence.

566
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:22,931
I know that you both

567
00:50:22,956 --> 00:50:24,236
don’t like each other.

568
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:26,564
But

569
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:27,923
I'm actually happy.

570
00:50:29,174 --> 00:50:30,174
I mean,

571
00:50:30,619 --> 00:50:32,603
it's better than working with strangers.

572
00:50:33,353 --> 00:50:35,626
Like, we are friends.

573
00:50:35,978 --> 00:50:37,189
It’s easy for us to talk

574
00:50:37,666 --> 00:50:39,346
if there's any problem.

575
00:50:42,517 --> 00:50:43,517
Yes.

576
00:50:45,788 --> 00:50:47,788
Have you reached an agreement with him?

577
00:50:49,429 --> 00:50:50,429
Yeah.

578
00:50:51,249 --> 00:50:52,369
It’s done.

579
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:03,275
How about you? What’s your new job?

580
00:51:03,955 --> 00:51:05,235
Can you tell me?

581
00:51:08,072 --> 00:51:09,689
Just a general sales manager.

582
00:51:12,049 --> 00:51:13,649
Do you feel bad again?

583
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:20,540
I...

584
00:51:21,322 --> 00:51:22,744
can't stop thinking about it.

585
00:51:24,744 --> 00:51:26,369
I don’t want you to be like this.

586
00:51:30,041 --> 00:51:31,081
I’m so sorry.

587
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:34,837
Sorry for what?

588
00:51:36,939 --> 00:51:37,970
Stop saying sorry.

589
00:51:40,275 --> 00:51:41,275
Let's hug.

590
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:10,584
I love you.

591
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:17,030
May I kiss you?

592
00:52:18,765 --> 00:52:19,772
Now?

593
00:52:21,068 --> 00:52:23,451
No way, we're having dinner.

594
00:52:24,397 --> 00:52:26,022
I haven’t brushed my teeth yet.

595
00:52:28,171 --> 00:52:29,451
Then right here.

596
00:52:30,585 --> 00:52:31,585
Please?

597
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,604
I just want to forget

598
00:52:49,629 --> 00:52:52,839
the memories that I still hold tightly.

599
00:52:52,864 --> 00:52:54,901
Erase your image from my heart.

600
00:52:54,925 --> 00:52:59,831
(The Luminous Solution)

601
00:53:01,003 --> 00:53:07,112
(The Luminous Solution)

602
00:53:30,437 --> 00:53:31,577
You were sleeping,

603
00:53:31,602 --> 00:53:33,108
so I didn’t want to wake you up.

604
00:53:33,133 --> 00:53:34,304
I'll return late tonight,

605
00:53:34,329 --> 00:53:35,702
so please have dinner first.

606
00:54:00,782 --> 00:54:01,782
Dr. Phathit,

607
00:54:02,992 --> 00:54:04,047
the report from this

608
00:54:04,072 --> 00:54:05,265
morning’s ward round.

609
00:54:07,461 --> 00:54:08,741
Thanks, sister Pen.

610
00:54:10,023 --> 00:54:11,625
Congratulations on your clinic.

611
00:54:12,078 --> 00:54:13,226
Dr. Prem just

612
00:54:13,602 --> 00:54:15,109
announced it everywhere.

613
00:54:15,727 --> 00:54:16,727
It's nothing.

614
00:54:17,071 --> 00:54:18,367
I've just started.

615
00:54:18,703 --> 00:54:20,656
The deal was just signed yesterday.

616
00:54:21,711 --> 00:54:23,711
Every first step is important.

617
00:54:25,867 --> 00:54:26,907
Thanks again.

618
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:28,555
Sure.

619
00:54:32,016 --> 00:54:34,187
Hello, sister Pen.

620
00:54:40,875 --> 00:54:41,875
Phathit.

621
00:54:42,508 --> 00:54:44,000
What time will you be off today?

622
00:54:44,016 --> 00:54:46,281
Around 5 p.m.

623
00:54:49,938 --> 00:54:51,138
I might go first.

624
00:54:51,774 --> 00:54:52,922
See you later tonight.

625
00:54:54,821 --> 00:54:56,180
Sure. See you there.

626
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:21,742
Hey, Ryou.

627
00:55:21,774 --> 00:55:22,774
Hey.

628
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:24,023
Did you finish your homework?

629
00:55:24,032 --> 00:55:25,656
Of course. What about you?

630
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:27,539
Yes, I did.

631
00:55:28,618 --> 00:55:29,618
Nack!

632
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:32,828
Huh?

633
00:55:32,844 --> 00:55:33,992
What's with him?

634
00:55:36,477 --> 00:55:37,547
Did you guys fight?

635
00:55:38,422 --> 00:55:39,422
No.

636
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
No?

637
00:55:41,235 --> 00:55:42,484
He already went there.

638
00:55:48,821 --> 00:55:49,821
Last night

639
00:55:51,133 --> 00:55:52,173
he confessed.

640
00:55:58,211 --> 00:55:59,596
So,

641
00:55:59,621 --> 00:56:01,018
what did you tell him?

642
00:56:05,277 --> 00:56:06,510
I rejected him.

643
00:56:12,321 --> 00:56:13,521
Hey, it's alright.

644
00:56:14,931 --> 00:56:16,051
He'll be fine.

645
00:56:20,196 --> 00:56:21,696
I'm not losing a friend, right?

646
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,297
No way.

647
00:56:25,852 --> 00:56:27,292
You don't like him,

648
00:56:27,556 --> 00:56:28,938
he has to accept it.

649
00:56:35,353 --> 00:56:36,665
Shall we go to class?

650
00:56:37,813 --> 00:56:38,813
Hey wait,

651
00:56:38,915 --> 00:56:40,360
you're not waiting for Mai?

652
00:56:40,735 --> 00:56:41,735
No.

653
00:56:41,806 --> 00:56:42,836
We'll meet in class.

654
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:45,790
- Okay.
- Let's go.

655
00:56:52,095 --> 00:56:53,391
What to write here?

656
00:56:53,415 --> 00:56:54,431
Is it H2O?

657
00:56:54,681 --> 00:56:56,141
Yes, and the color's changed.

658
00:56:56,509 --> 00:56:57,509
Okay.

659
00:57:00,048 --> 00:57:03,102
It's changed from blue to green, right?

660
00:57:04,634 --> 00:57:06,313
- Red, too.
- Okay.

661
00:57:16,056 --> 00:57:17,657
Don't worry.

662
00:57:17,689 --> 00:57:18,923
He'll get better soon.

663
00:57:18,948 --> 00:57:20,016
Let him be.

664
00:57:30,978 --> 00:57:31,978
Hey.

665
00:57:33,399 --> 00:57:35,196
Planning to blow up this lab now?

666
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:38,235
Didn't you listen to what the teacher said?

667
00:59:11,313 --> 00:59:12,679
(THE CROWN)

668
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,464
(Thana)

669
01:01:29,098 --> 01:01:30,511
Have you finished your work?

670
01:01:30,535 --> 01:01:31,535
Yes.

671
01:01:31,848 --> 01:01:32,848
But.

672
01:01:33,379 --> 01:01:34,574
I have plans later.

673
01:01:34,599 --> 01:01:36,039
Where are you going?

674
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:39,035
Prem invited the investors

675
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:41,136
for a celebration.

676
01:01:42,642 --> 01:01:43,642
I see.

677
01:01:44,306 --> 01:01:45,680
Would you like to join us?

678
01:01:47,017 --> 01:01:48,017
Maybe not.

679
01:01:50,048 --> 01:01:51,048
Okay.

680
01:01:51,399 --> 01:01:52,399
Then...

681
01:01:53,845 --> 01:01:55,149
Don’t drink too much.

682
01:01:55,759 --> 01:01:57,563
You can call me and I'll pick you up.

683
01:01:58,603 --> 01:01:59,723
Okay.

684
01:02:00,306 --> 01:02:01,306
See you.

685
01:02:21,745 --> 01:02:22,799
Where were you?

686
01:02:23,222 --> 01:02:24,440
I ran out of ciggs.

687
01:02:25,268 --> 01:02:26,580
Have you had anything?

688
01:02:26,869 --> 01:02:28,307
Let’s find something to eat.

689
01:02:28,386 --> 01:02:29,877
Okay, but…

690
01:02:31,995 --> 01:02:32,995
My treat.

691
01:02:35,776 --> 01:02:36,776
Deal.

692
01:03:33,285 --> 01:03:34,675
Hello, Mom and Dad.

693
01:03:39,777 --> 01:03:41,386
I'll put the picture frame here.

694
01:03:59,543 --> 01:04:01,402
(Chalermtai)

695
01:04:14,145 --> 01:04:15,345
Congratulations, man.

696
01:04:16,184 --> 01:04:17,363
Thanks, man.

697
01:04:18,832 --> 01:04:20,272
You really shouldn't have.

698
01:04:21,363 --> 01:04:22,363
It's fine.

699
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:27,239
Let’s take a picture!

700
01:04:31,621 --> 01:04:33,061
One.. Two…

701
01:04:50,895 --> 01:04:52,762
Hey, can I put it there?

702
01:04:52,787 --> 01:04:53,895
Sure.

703
01:04:57,083 --> 01:04:58,203
Are you tired?

704
01:04:59,848 --> 01:05:01,082
Not at all.

705
01:05:02,114 --> 01:05:03,887
You and I will face more hardship.

706
01:05:07,231 --> 01:05:08,231
Cheers!

707
01:05:11,387 --> 01:05:12,894
One… Two… Three...

708
01:06:04,866 --> 01:06:06,483
Let me treat you to some beers.

709
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:07,546
Yeah.

710
01:06:08,288 --> 01:06:09,648
You said it, bro!

711
01:06:34,635 --> 01:06:35,635
Oh.

712
01:06:37,197 --> 01:06:38,252
Come in.

713
01:07:00,385 --> 01:07:01,425
Are you okay?

714
01:07:08,644 --> 01:07:10,003
Can I sleep over tonight?

715
01:07:13,410 --> 01:07:14,410
Sure.

716
01:07:32,084 --> 01:07:33,771
Is your hand getting better now?

717
01:07:36,858 --> 01:07:38,378
Such a small wound,

718
01:07:38,983 --> 01:07:40,183
I'm all healed.

719
01:07:43,538 --> 01:07:44,538
Can I see?

720
01:07:49,061 --> 01:07:50,341
It's better now?

721
01:07:52,069 --> 01:07:53,069
Oww...

722
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:55,170
Mai!

723
01:07:57,123 --> 01:07:58,396
You said it’s healed now.

724
01:08:00,725 --> 01:08:01,725
Geez...

725
01:08:03,866 --> 01:08:04,866
Mai!

726
01:08:07,209 --> 01:08:08,209
It hurts.

727
01:08:10,834 --> 01:08:11,834
Be gentle.

728
01:08:46,285 --> 01:08:47,325
(Chalermtai)
Are you okay?

729
01:08:49,270 --> 01:08:50,270
I’m fine.

730
01:08:50,434 --> 01:08:51,434
I think.

731
01:09:03,797 --> 01:09:04,797
Brother,

732
01:09:05,476 --> 01:09:06,891
I'll go to the toilet.

733
01:09:07,078 --> 01:09:08,078
Sure.

734
01:09:08,469 --> 01:09:09,509
Are you okay?

735
01:09:11,016 --> 01:09:12,055
Wait a moment.

736
01:09:14,212 --> 01:09:15,212
Hey.

737
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:25,599
I’ll be right back.

738
01:09:25,919 --> 01:09:27,020
I'd better check on him.

739
01:09:27,045 --> 01:09:28,045
Sure.

740
01:09:38,312 --> 01:09:39,710
Cheers, bro.

741
01:09:48,526 --> 01:09:49,854
Do you believe in magic?

742
01:09:51,909 --> 01:09:52,909
A fairy tale?

743
01:09:54,714 --> 01:09:55,714
Do you believe it?

744
01:09:57,064 --> 01:09:58,104
I got a job

745
01:09:59,503 --> 01:10:00,503
from

746
01:10:00,987 --> 01:10:02,573
making a wish.

747
01:10:03,049 --> 01:10:04,915
Which shrine did you visit?

748
01:10:05,792 --> 01:10:06,792
I'll go too.

749
01:10:08,237 --> 01:10:09,823
I didn't make a vow.

750
01:10:11,323 --> 01:10:13,745
I made a wish in a cafe.

751
01:10:17,026 --> 01:10:19,160
Wow. You're talking nonsense.

752
01:10:20,854 --> 01:10:21,963
You are drunk now.

753
01:10:28,142 --> 01:10:29,142
So...

754
01:10:30,557 --> 01:10:32,237
What did you ask for?

755
01:10:41,474 --> 01:10:43,874
At first, I was thinking about love.

756
01:10:45,443 --> 01:10:47,481
But you changed it to getting a new job.

757
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:55,793
We've been dating for so long.

758
01:11:01,075 --> 01:11:02,372
Wow...

759
01:11:02,466 --> 01:11:04,400
You and your boyfriend's love

760
01:11:04,896 --> 01:11:06,075
is so wonderful.

761
01:11:12,029 --> 01:11:14,349
But achieving success in your job

762
01:11:15,997 --> 01:11:17,747
is important to me.

763
01:11:24,497 --> 01:11:25,497
Right!

764
01:11:25,787 --> 01:11:27,467
Can I ask you a question?

765
01:11:29,676 --> 01:11:30,676
What?

766
01:11:32,348 --> 01:11:33,956
Have you ever cheated on him?

767
01:11:34,769 --> 01:11:35,769
Never.

768
01:11:39,262 --> 01:11:40,262
And him?

769
01:11:41,137 --> 01:11:42,417
What about him?

770
01:11:42,442 --> 01:11:44,559
Do you think he has ever cheated on you?

771
01:12:10,609 --> 01:12:12,148
Hey!

772
01:12:13,898 --> 01:12:14,992
Are you really okay?

773
01:12:23,718 --> 01:12:24,662
Hey...

774
01:12:24,687 --> 01:12:25,687
Yeah?

775
01:12:27,561 --> 01:12:29,022
Thank you, man.

776
01:12:30,968 --> 01:12:31,990
Thanks for what?

777
01:12:32,811 --> 01:12:35,975
You are making my dream come true.

778
01:12:41,118 --> 01:12:42,367
As I said before,

779
01:12:43,837 --> 01:12:44,930
that’s my pleasure.

780
01:12:48,633 --> 01:12:49,633
I know.

781
01:12:51,305 --> 01:12:52,305
Then...

782
01:12:54,993 --> 01:12:57,000
Can I say thanks to you one last time?

783
01:12:58,523 --> 01:13:00,452
Okay? From now on,

784
01:13:01,484 --> 01:13:02,726
I won’t say it anymore.

785
01:13:03,914 --> 01:13:04,914
Okay?

786
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:08,232
Are you really okay?

787
01:13:08,413 --> 01:13:09,413
Huh?

788
01:13:10,382 --> 01:13:11,562
I think you are drunk.

789
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,155
You're okay, right?

790
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:18,851
Maybe.

791
01:13:22,328 --> 01:13:23,528
I feel so glad

792
01:13:25,304 --> 01:13:27,104
to have a friend working with me.

793
01:13:50,075 --> 01:13:51,482
I believe that Phathit

794
01:13:52,826 --> 01:13:54,185
has never cheated on me.

795
01:13:56,186 --> 01:13:57,529
What makes you so sure?

796
01:14:01,967 --> 01:14:02,967
Because Phathit

797
01:14:04,475 --> 01:14:05,763
always works so hard.

798
01:14:08,553 --> 01:14:10,233
And how's that related?

799
01:14:12,873 --> 01:14:13,913
Even having sex

800
01:14:16,225 --> 01:14:17,225
is rare.

801
01:14:19,654 --> 01:14:20,795
You're starving, huh?

802
01:14:23,248 --> 01:14:24,248
You are...

803
01:14:24,272 --> 01:14:25,272
A kid!

804
01:14:25,297 --> 01:14:26,749
You wouldn't understand it.

805
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:30,341
Clever!

806
01:14:30,568 --> 01:14:31,688
Same old joke.

807
01:14:41,566 --> 01:14:42,566
I think so, too.

808
01:14:49,308 --> 01:14:50,308
Hey,

809
01:14:50,714 --> 01:14:51,995
why are you doing that?

810
01:14:52,753 --> 01:14:54,269
Do you like me or something?

811
01:14:58,035 --> 01:14:59,035
Yeah.

(Next episode)
Can I try kissing you?

814
01:16:03,168 --> 01:16:04,168
Hey.

815
01:16:04,684 --> 01:16:06,473
Why aren't you answering my call?

816
01:16:07,379 --> 01:16:08,691
You don't even come home.

817
01:16:10,145 --> 01:16:11,145
Hey.

818
01:16:11,168 --> 01:16:12,973
The hell? Why aren't you answering?

819
01:16:13,036 --> 01:16:14,036
You okay?

820
01:16:14,129 --> 01:16:15,184
Leave me alone.

821
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:16,271
What's wrong?

822
01:16:16,332 --> 01:16:17,691
Are you going to tell him?

823
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:18,740
Probably not.

824
01:16:20,372 --> 01:16:26,637
(The Luminous Solution)
Can I forget you? I really want to forget.

825
01:16:28,263 --> 01:16:30,465
Forget everything.

826
01:16:31,130 --> 01:16:34,489
Even if I wanted to, I can't.

827
01:16:34,581 --> 01:16:37,503
Forget everything.

828
01:16:37,552 --> 01:16:39,200
Enough already.

829
01:16:39,216 --> 01:16:40,973
It's over.

830
01:16:40,998 --> 01:16:44,387
Forget already.

831
01:16:44,505 --> 01:16:49,192
Can I forget?

832
01:16:58,685 --> 01:17:00,630
I just want to forget

833
01:17:00,655 --> 01:17:03,880
the memories that I still hold tightly.

834
01:17:04,169 --> 01:17:07,426
Erase your image from my heart.

835
01:17:07,771 --> 01:17:12,426
Please let me forget, let me forget.

836
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:14,990
I just want to forget,

837
01:17:15,015 --> 01:17:18,293
how long must I remember?

838
01:17:18,386 --> 01:17:20,862
Like a curse that makes me forget

839
01:17:20,887 --> 01:17:25,425
you last.

840
01:17:28,378 --> 01:17:30,620
Can I forget you,

841
01:17:30,645 --> 01:17:33,972
I just want to forget.
