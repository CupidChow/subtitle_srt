1
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,200
[Mother]

2
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,960
Yes, Mother?

3
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,880
You want me to come home now?

4
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,720
Okay.

5
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,460
Sure.

6
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,320
- Alright.
- Make yourselves at home.

7
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,464
- Today's a good day.
- There she is.

8
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,880
Prem, come on in.

9
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,120
Prem,

10
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,560
greet Krich's parents.

11
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,680
Good morning.

12
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,920
Good morning.

13
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,560
This is Prem, our daughter.

14
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,840
Now that she's here,

15
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,240
should we start?

16
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,120
Alright.

17
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,440
I went to ask a monk for an auspicious date.

18
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,320
The soonest is next month.

19
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,400
What's the date for, Father?

20
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,400
For your engagement with Krich, of course.

21
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,280
Engagement?

22
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,280
Isn't this too soon, Father?

23
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,440
Krich and I have only seen
each other for a while.

24
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,580
It's not too soon at all.

25
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,520
You've known him for several years now.

26
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,600
No need to waste time
getting to know each other anymore.

27
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,000
You can learn more
about each other after you get married.

28
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,920
Is that right?

29
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,080
Right.

30
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,400
Yes.

31
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,680
Don't you worry, Prem.

32
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,480
Krich has already told us about you.

33
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,960
We know all about you.

34
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,640
And the moment I saw you,

35
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,520
I felt a connection right away.

36
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,600
Right, honey?

37
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,800
Yes.

38
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,080
Please excuse me for a moment.

39
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,280
Yes, Bow?

40
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,720
Prem,

41
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,600
stay calm, okay?

42
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,440
Pat was in a car accident.

43
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,840
She's at the hospital right now.

44
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,760
The doctors
are doing everything they can.

45
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,200
Prem, maybe you should hang up first,

46
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,320
so we can discuss the engagement.

47
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,680
Prem...

48
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,960
Prem?

49
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,000
- Prem...
- Prem...

50
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,000
Prem, where are you going?

51
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,760
I'm not getting engaged.

52
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,600
No engagement will happen.

53
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,440
Prem, where are you going? Come here!

54
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,640
I can't be engaged as you wish, Father.

55
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,520
The person I love
is waiting for me right now.

56
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,680
I'm really sorry,

57
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,840
but my heart belongs to someone else.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And she's a woman.

59
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,440
Prem...

60
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,080
Prem!

61
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,240
[RAM2 Hospital]

62
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,960
Papa...

63
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,277
- Mama...
- Prem?

64
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,560
I'm sorry, Mama.

65
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,120
If I had stayed with her

66
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,000
and taken good care of her,

67
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,840
she wouldn't have ended up like this.

68
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,120
Hey, it's not your fault at all.

69
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,040
None of us wanted this,

70
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,840
okay?

71
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,214
It's okay, sweetie.

72
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,934
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

73
00:04:53,956 --> 00:04:55,020
It's okay.

74
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,120
Bow...

75
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,200
Is Pat seriously hurt?

76
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,120
The doctors are trying to save her.

77
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,720
Sita's in there, too.

78
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,360
Prem,

79
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,040
there's something you need to know.

80
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,440
Pat's had a heart condition.

81
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,480
Honey...

82
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,320
She probably lost consciousness
because of an arrhythmia,

83
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,290
which caused the crash.

84
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,920
Her chest hit the steering wheel really hard,

85
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,000
and now she has bleeding around her heart.

86
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,280
Her pulse's dropping.

87
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,080
Adrenaline, please.

88
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,680
Adrenaline injected.

89
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,000
- I wanna...
- Prem...

90
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,141
- Prem...
- Hey, Prem.

91
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:39,880
- Let me go.
- No.

92
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,640
Prem...

93
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,200
You know you can't go in there.

94
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:43,840
Let me see her.

95
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,400
- Prem...
- Prem!

96
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,560
- Prem...
- I need to save her.

97
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,000
- Prem...
- Let me go.

98
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,560
Pat...

99
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,280
I need to save her.

100
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,000
Let me save her.

101
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,120
Let me in.

102
00:05:59,160 --> 00:05:59,680
Pat...

103
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,040
Pat...

104
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,240
Pat!

105
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
I need to save her.

106
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,120
- Pat...
- Prem...

107
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,720
Her heart has stopped.

108
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,800
Pat!

109
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,200
Pat!

110
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,560
- Prem...
- Hey...

111
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
- Prem...
- Prem...

112
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,520
Prem!

113
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,960
Start CPR.

114
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,000
Pat... Pat!

115
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,400
- Prem?
- Prem...

116
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,440
Are you awake, dear?

117
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,560
Look,

118
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,600
you passed out,

119
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,360
so we took you home.

120
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,200
Stay here for now, okay?

121
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,000
- Prem...
- Hey, Prem.

122
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,000
Hey, Prem.

123
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,120
Stop.

124
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,840
Prem...

125
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,240
Where are you going?

126
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
Where are you going, dear?

127
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm going to see Pat.

128
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,240
She's waiting for me.

129
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,800
Don't stop me, Father, Mother.

130
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,320
- No, Prem.
- You can't.

131
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,960
I won't let you do that.

132
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,960
No.

133
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,440
I will go.

134
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,640
You can't stop me this time.

135
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,840
- Prem...
- Hey, stop.

136
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,760
- Prem!
- Prem!

137
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,680
She is no longer with us!

138
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,920
Listen to me.

139
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,120
She's dead.

140
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,480
Do you hear me?

141
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,520
She's gone, dear.

142
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,120
No...

143
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,400
No...

144
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,720
That's not true.

145
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:44,520
It can't be.

146
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,520
- No...
- Get over it, dear.

147
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,280
No...

148
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,560
- It can't be true.
- Prem...

149
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,000
- You're lying.
- Prem...

150
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,320
I'm going to see her.

151
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,280
No...

152
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,560
Prem...

153
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,320
Prem, accept it, okay?

154
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,560
- You need to accept it.
- Let me go, Mother.

155
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,360
No.

156
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,760
- Pat...
- Prem...

157
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,600
Hey.

158
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,160
- Pat...
- Prem!

159
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,880
Pat is gone, Prem.

160
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,000
She is gone.

161
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,200
She's dead.

162
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,560
Accept it, okay?

163
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,236
Prem...

164
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,480
She's not...

165
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,574
She's not dead.

166
00:08:50,632 --> 00:08:51,650
Prem...

167
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,680
I'm really worried about her.

168
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,680
Darling,

169
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,160
is she gonna be okay?

170
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,120
After some time,

171
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,840
she'll feel better.

172
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,080
Don't you worry.

173
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,480
Prem?

174
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,800
Prem,

175
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,040
what do you want?

176
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,880
What are you looking for?

177
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,640
Hey, tell me.

178
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,040
I want my phone.

179
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,120
Have you seen it?

180
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,880
You took it, didn't you?

181
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,240
Give it to me, Mother.

182
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,720
Why do you want it?

183
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,000
You can't do anything with it.

184
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,200
I just want to call Bow.

185
00:10:16,313 --> 00:10:17,600
I want to know...

186
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,520
if she said anything about me

187
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,680
or how she was doing.

188
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,160
What's the point of knowing that?

189
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,320
It will not bring her back.

190
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,880
You need to face the truth

191
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,160
and learn to live with it.

192
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,600
I'm not asking you to do this for us,

193
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,920
but I want you to do it for yourself.

194
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,400
Please, Prem.

195
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,680
Trust me, my dear.

196
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,680
Prem...

197
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,360
Eat something,

198
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,600
or you'll fall ill.

199
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,680
Tell us what you'd like to eat.

200
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,480
I'll go get it, okay?

201
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,600
Can I please go see Pat?

202
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,520
I know she's gone,

203
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,320
but I want to say goodbye to her.

204
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,840
Can you please let me do that?

205
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,120
Please, Father.

206
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,120
Please, Mother.

207
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,835
Prem...

208
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,160
Once you're feeling better,

209
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,960
I'll let you do so.

210
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,760
Even now,

211
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,160
you still won't let me go?

212
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,680
Can I ask you something?

213
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,240
All my life,

214
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,840
have I been such a terrible daughter?

215
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,880
Is that why
I deserve to be punished like this?

216
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,640
No, not like that, dear.

217
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,780
Then why won't you let me
say goodbye to her?

218
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,600
She's already gone.

219
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,600
We can't be together anymore.

220
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,200
Can I just...

221
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,560
see her for one last time?

222
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,480
Mother,

223
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,600
I'm begging you.

224
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,180
My heart...

225
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,880
can't bear this pain anymore.

226
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,920
Prem...

227
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,560
Pat...

228
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,080
Oh...

229
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,880
I've given her the medicine.

230
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,480
She should fall asleep soon.

231
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,560
Darling...

232
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,920
You should get some rest.

233
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,880
All my life,

234
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,120
have I been such a terrible daughter?

235
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,440
She hasn't eaten anything.

236
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,480
Prem,

237
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,160
eat something, okay?

238
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,760
Pat...

239
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,880
Pat!

240
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,200
- Prem...
- Pat!

241
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,960
- Dear...
- Pat...

242
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,480
What happened?

243
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,520
What's wrong?

244
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,720
Pat...

245
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,200
- Did you have a nightmare?
- Pat...

246
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,875
- Pat...
- Tell me.

247
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,400
Was it a bad dream?

248
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,680
Pat came to me, Mother.

249
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,440
It was just a bad dream.

250
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,720
It's gonna be okay.

251
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,640
I'm right here, okay?

252
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,920
It's okay, dear.

253
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,640
I love her, Mother.

254
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,600
So much...

255
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,480
Can you please tell Father...

256
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,520
that I love him so much as well?

257
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,720
But why can the person I love the most...

258
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,360
be this cruel to me?

259
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,960
So you are alone?

260
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,680
Aren't your parents coming, too?

261
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,240
I'm sorry, Uncle, Auntie,

262
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,240
but Prem and I will not get engaged.

263
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,000
I understand that it's hard for you,

264
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,360
but...

265
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,200
we should wait...

266
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,120
until she's back to normal, okay?

267
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,280
Uncle,

268
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,520
we all know who her heart belongs to.

269
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,320
I think...

270
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,200
you should stop telling her what to do

271
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,640
and let her follow her own heart.

272
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,400
That's all I wanted to say.

273
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,840
I'll take my leave now.

274
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,160
Goodbye.

275
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,360
Prem...

276
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,080
- Prem...
- Prem!

277
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,440
Prem, dear...

278
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,640
- Prem...
- What happened?

279
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,080
- Hey, Prem.
- Are you okay?

280
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:07,080
Prem...

281
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,920
Are you hurt?

282
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,400
Mother,

283
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,320
I don't want to live anymore.

284
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,840
Prem,

285
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
don't say that.

286
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,680
Please don't.

287
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,480
Don't say it.

288
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,600
Prem...

289
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,120
I miss her.

290
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,240
I miss her every single day.

291
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,340
Pratt,

292
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,800
I can't do this anymore.

293
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,960
You heard her, didn't you?

294
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,280
She doesn't want to live anymore.

295
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,480
All this time,

296
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,200
I've done everything you asked.

297
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,040
But from now on,

298
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,040
I won't do it anymore.

299
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,960
Our daughter is dying.

300
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm going to save her.

301
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,440
I'm not gonna do what you say.

302
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,400
But everything we've done is for her.

303
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,800
For her?

304
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,920
Are you sure it wasn't for us?

305
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,560
Stop making excuses.

306
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,520
It's Prem

307
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,480
who's tried to do everything for us.

308
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,520
Whatever you forced her to do,

309
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,040
she always agreed, just to satisfy you.

310
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,320
And if we keep doing this,

311
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,160
we will be...

312
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,920
the ones making her live with suffering.

313
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,960
I'm done with this.

314
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,040
I love my daughter.

315
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,360
You?

316
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,200
Do you even love her as much as she loves you?

317
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,040
Life is unpredictable.

318
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,360
Death could come at any time.

319
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,040
Once the funeral's over,

320
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,640
only memories will remain.

321
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,920
Yeah.

322
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,280
That's why we need to do our best every day.

323
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,360
Have we done our best today to help Prem?

324
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,640
Are we doing the right thing?

325
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,920
Her parents asked us not to contact her.

326
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,720
What can we do about that?

327
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,160
How about this?

328
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,400
Should we just go to see her?

329
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,260
They asked us not to contact her,

330
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,360
but they didn't say we couldn't see her.

331
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,520
You're right.

332
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,080
Why didn't it ever cross my mind?

333
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,520
Let's go, Tan.

334
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,800
Yeah, let's go.

335
00:20:52,053 --> 00:20:53,320
I can't stand this any longer.

336
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,200
Bring it!

337
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,500
What's so surprising?

338
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,540
Is your mom calling you?

339
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,600
It's not my mom, but Prem's.

340
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,160
How did she know we were going to Prem?

341
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,080
Just pick it up.

342
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,120
Something might've happened.

343
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,200
Yes, Mother?

344
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,320
Bow,

345
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,040
can you help me?

346
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,600
Yes, Mother.

347
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,680
We've been ready to help for a while now.

348
00:21:52,346 --> 00:21:54,546
Why did you take me here, Mother?

349
00:21:57,346 --> 00:21:58,186
Prem...

350
00:22:00,632 --> 00:22:01,546
Father?

351
00:22:01,906 --> 00:22:03,106
I'm sorry.

352
00:22:04,386 --> 00:22:06,506
I've been a failure as a father

353
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:09,626
and as a husband.

354
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:15,466
I was selfish.

355
00:22:16,216 --> 00:22:19,416
I made you do what I thought was right,

356
00:22:19,826 --> 00:22:22,066
even though you did nothing wrong.

357
00:22:22,746 --> 00:22:23,666
Father...

358
00:22:28,066 --> 00:22:29,466
I'm sorry, too, dear.

359
00:22:30,026 --> 00:22:32,386
I'm sorry for being cruel to you.

360
00:22:32,826 --> 00:22:34,346
I know I was wrong,

361
00:22:35,426 --> 00:22:36,786
but please forgive me.

362
00:22:50,946 --> 00:22:53,146
Thank you, Father, Mother,

363
00:22:53,466 --> 00:22:54,746
for understanding me.

364
00:22:55,546 --> 00:22:58,786
I never thought this day would ever come.

365
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:02,186
I'm really grateful.

366
00:23:10,886 --> 00:23:12,146
Does that mean...

367
00:23:13,546 --> 00:23:16,586
I'm allowed to love Pat now?

368
00:23:18,506 --> 00:23:19,626
You are, dear.

369
00:23:20,146 --> 00:23:22,066
You can love her now.

370
00:23:24,226 --> 00:23:25,426
Thank you.

371
00:23:27,386 --> 00:23:29,626
Even though it's too late...

372
00:23:32,026 --> 00:23:33,386
It is not, Prem.

373
00:23:37,106 --> 00:23:38,546
I need to tell you one thing.

374
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:43,786
I lied to you about something very serious

375
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:45,626
and even forced your mother

376
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:47,986
and your friends to keep it from you.

377
00:23:49,506 --> 00:23:51,106
If you want to love Pat,

378
00:23:53,906 --> 00:23:55,426
do it with all your heart.

379
00:23:57,226 --> 00:23:58,386
She's coming.

380
00:24:37,946 --> 00:24:38,866
Prem...

381
00:24:45,586 --> 00:24:47,346
This isn't a dream, is it?

382
00:24:48,146 --> 00:24:49,426
It is not.

383
00:24:51,946 --> 00:24:53,266
I'm right here.

384
00:25:43,786 --> 00:25:44,626
Pat.

385
00:25:46,386 --> 00:25:47,826
I'm sorry.

386
00:25:48,586 --> 00:25:49,826
I'm really sorry

387
00:25:49,866 --> 00:25:51,746
for giving up on you.

388
00:25:52,906 --> 00:25:55,426
I'm sorry I didn't stay by your side

389
00:25:57,146 --> 00:25:59,226
and made you end up hurt.

390
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,306
It was an accident, Prem.

391
00:26:07,826 --> 00:26:09,603
And I'm really sorry

392
00:26:12,306 --> 00:26:15,097
that I never knew
you had a heart problem.

393
00:26:17,146 --> 00:26:18,906
I didn't know, either.

394
00:26:20,266 --> 00:26:22,146
There were only some symptoms,

395
00:26:23,466 --> 00:26:25,266
but I never told you about them

396
00:26:26,426 --> 00:26:28,386
'cause I didn't want to worry you.

397
00:26:29,386 --> 00:26:31,906
You need to tell me everything, okay?

398
00:26:35,146 --> 00:26:36,346
From now on,

399
00:26:37,646 --> 00:26:39,186
I'll take care of you,

400
00:26:40,306 --> 00:26:41,506
every part of you.

401
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:43,826
I promise.

402
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,266
Thank you

403
00:26:56,706 --> 00:26:58,586
for keeping your promise.

404
00:26:59,506 --> 00:27:01,626
You told me to wait for you

405
00:27:04,186 --> 00:27:06,586
until we could be together again.

406
00:27:09,486 --> 00:27:11,706
I tried, Prem.

407
00:27:14,046 --> 00:27:16,146
I was in such a serious condition,

408
00:27:16,626 --> 00:27:17,846
but I guess...

409
00:27:22,706 --> 00:27:24,626
my will to see you
must've been so strong...

410
00:27:28,886 --> 00:27:30,986
So I cheated death.

411
00:27:34,226 --> 00:27:35,626
Did I do well?

412
00:27:38,886 --> 00:27:40,286
Of course you did.

413
00:27:42,186 --> 00:27:43,866
You're the best, Pat.

414
00:27:48,106 --> 00:27:50,986
And you're really back.

415
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:55,106
I need to.

416
00:27:57,166 --> 00:27:58,226
I was wrong

417
00:27:59,626 --> 00:28:01,466
for letting you go.

418
00:28:04,226 --> 00:28:05,426
I'm sorry

419
00:28:06,346 --> 00:28:08,386
for keeping you waiting this long.

420
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:11,986
As long as it's you,

421
00:28:13,786 --> 00:28:16,066
I can wait no matter how long it takes.

422
00:28:17,186 --> 00:28:18,586
You don't need to wait anymore.

423
00:28:20,146 --> 00:28:21,986
I'm right here,

424
00:28:23,826 --> 00:28:26,026
and I'm not leaving you ever again.

425
00:28:30,706 --> 00:28:31,986
Don't cry, okay?

426
00:28:36,146 --> 00:28:46,066
♫I was born to be the moon to your sun♫

427
00:28:46,586 --> 00:28:54,186
♫With you by my side,
there's nothing else I'd like♫

428
00:28:55,186 --> 00:29:00,026
♫You're the love I'm longing for♫

429
00:29:00,066 --> 00:29:04,506
♫The heaven-sent one I adore♫

430
00:29:04,866 --> 00:29:10,586
♫The final answer to my prayers♫

431
00:29:10,626 --> 00:29:14,426
♫You will be my only love♫

432
00:29:14,466 --> 00:29:19,266
♫For as long as I shall live♫

433
00:29:21,586 --> 00:29:22,786
I love you.

434
00:29:26,146 --> 00:29:27,346
I love you, too.

435
00:29:32,706 --> 00:29:37,706
♫My heart will belong to you♫

436
00:29:44,506 --> 00:29:45,266
So...

437
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:46,586
today,

438
00:29:47,066 --> 00:29:50,146
I'm here to apologize for my rudeness.

439
00:29:50,186 --> 00:29:52,706
I want your daughter to stop seeing mine.

440
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:56,226
We may differ in opinion,

441
00:29:57,066 --> 00:29:58,426
but whatever you say,

442
00:29:59,346 --> 00:30:01,746
I'll never accept
your daughter into my family.

443
00:30:05,186 --> 00:30:07,866
We've realized we were narrow-minded,

444
00:30:08,226 --> 00:30:10,666
unable to accept their love for what it is.

445
00:30:13,866 --> 00:30:15,626
But we truly regret it now,

446
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:18,786
and we hope you can forgive us.

447
00:30:22,586 --> 00:30:23,546
Mr. Pratt...

448
00:30:23,586 --> 00:30:24,226
Yes?

449
00:30:25,306 --> 00:30:26,746
I need you to answer this.

450
00:30:27,546 --> 00:30:29,466
What matters the most to you now?

451
00:30:38,426 --> 00:30:39,626
Prem's happiness.

452
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:47,466
You've finally realized

453
00:30:47,906 --> 00:30:48,986
that you were wrong.

454
00:30:54,266 --> 00:30:55,386
We...

455
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:03,466
We forgive you.

456
00:31:07,786 --> 00:31:08,866
Thank you.

457
00:31:08,906 --> 00:31:09,786
Thank you so much.

458
00:31:11,906 --> 00:31:14,706
From now on, let's be one family.

459
00:31:14,826 --> 00:31:16,306
Thank you so much.

460
00:31:18,026 --> 00:31:19,986
I suppose it's our turn to learn

461
00:31:20,026 --> 00:31:22,706
what unconditional love means from you.

462
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:28,786
We can do that together.

463
00:31:32,906 --> 00:31:35,026
Thank you, Father.

464
00:31:35,746 --> 00:31:37,386
Thank you, Mother.

465
00:31:41,546 --> 00:31:42,546
Thank you.

466
00:32:32,178 --> 00:32:34,358
It's great to see them
talk things through so nicely.

467
00:32:37,138 --> 00:32:39,038
My parents were just pretending to be cold.

468
00:32:39,718 --> 00:32:40,718
I know them.

469
00:32:54,918 --> 00:32:56,438
What's wrong, Pat?

470
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:00,798
Can I really recover from this?

471
00:33:01,118 --> 00:33:02,278
Of course.

472
00:33:02,918 --> 00:33:04,998
You've got a pacemaker now

473
00:33:05,258 --> 00:33:07,678
and are doing physical therapy
as the doctor prescribed.

474
00:33:08,158 --> 00:33:09,158
Are you sure?

475
00:33:09,478 --> 00:33:10,478
I am.

476
00:33:11,518 --> 00:33:13,758
I just don't want to be a burden to you.

477
00:33:14,438 --> 00:33:15,878
What do you mean?

478
00:33:17,438 --> 00:33:18,238
Come on,

479
00:33:18,738 --> 00:33:20,638
why would you say that?

480
00:33:21,838 --> 00:33:23,838
You promised me

481
00:33:23,878 --> 00:33:26,038
that you'd be with me forever.

482
00:33:26,518 --> 00:33:28,598
Hang in there, my love.

483
00:33:29,638 --> 00:33:30,838
Just a little longer.

484
00:33:31,758 --> 00:33:33,638
You'll recover very soon.

485
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:40,038
My love is really for the right person.

486
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:44,398
I love you, too, my love.

487
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:48,118
How did I even fall for you

488
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:50,998
when you're such a crazy villainess?

489
00:33:51,918 --> 00:33:53,078
And so evil, too.

490
00:33:54,998 --> 00:33:56,718
There's no going back, you know.

491
00:33:58,118 --> 00:34:00,118
You're already trapped with this villainess.

492
00:34:02,418 --> 00:34:03,838
I'm fine with it, though.

493
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:07,958
This doctor loves her villainess
with all her heart.

494
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:12,558
This villainess also loves her doctor
with all her heart.

I'm sorry I couldn't make it
to your grandma's funeral.

534
00:37:27,798 --> 00:37:28,798
It's fine.

535
00:37:29,138 --> 00:37:31,518
Just the fact that you survived

536
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:33,918
is enough to let my grandma rest in peace.

537
00:37:35,398 --> 00:37:37,318
Come on, let's just celebrate.

538
00:37:37,878 --> 00:37:39,278
Cheers!

539
00:37:39,318 --> 00:37:42,198

00:37:43,478 --> 00:37:44,878
illness, danger,

542
00:37:44,918 --> 00:37:46,758
and all misfortune.

543
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:47,878
Come on, Bow!

544
00:37:48,198 --> 00:37:49,438
Your blessing sounds like a prayer.

545
00:37:49,478 --> 00:37:50,958
Should we say amen or something?

546
00:37:51,118 --> 00:37:52,638
- Amen.
- Amen.

547
00:37:52,678 --> 00:37:53,758
Hey, what's with you?

548
00:37:54,998 --> 00:37:56,758
Come on, let's just drink.

549
00:37:56,998 --> 00:37:58,558
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

550
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:02,118
You need to stay off alcohol.

551
00:38:03,438 --> 00:38:05,238
Mine's just water, Prem.

552
00:38:05,531 --> 00:38:06,598
Let me see.

553
00:38:06,638 --> 00:38:07,558
I don't believe you.

554
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:11,295
Okay, then.

555
00:38:11,478 --> 00:38:12,678
You're good.

556
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:15,198
- Okay, cheers!
- Cheers!

557
00:38:28,518 --> 00:38:31,038
Pat's so lucky to have Dr. Prem.

558
00:38:31,238 --> 00:38:32,678
I'm honestly relieved

559
00:38:32,718 --> 00:38:35,398
that you finally got away
from that so-called best friend.

560
00:38:36,998 --> 00:38:38,238
As for her,

561
00:38:38,278 --> 00:38:40,238
she's still living the same messed-up life.

562
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:41,798
What do you mean?

563
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:43,278
What do you know?

564
00:38:45,678 --> 00:38:47,838
What's going on, Tor?

565
00:38:47,878 --> 00:38:49,478
Who is this woman?

566
00:38:49,518 --> 00:38:50,158
Uh...

567
00:38:50,198 --> 00:38:50,878
Gosh,

568
00:38:51,158 --> 00:38:52,478
who am I?

569
00:38:52,758 --> 00:38:54,078
His wife, obviously.

570
00:38:54,938 --> 00:38:55,938
That's not true.

571
00:38:56,238 --> 00:38:58,878
You told me you were single, didn't you?

572
00:38:59,398 --> 00:39:00,958
Come on, you moron!

573
00:39:01,598 --> 00:39:03,278
He lied to you.

574
00:39:04,198 --> 00:39:04,918
Tor,

575
00:39:05,238 --> 00:39:06,478
go home now.

576
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:07,998
No,

577
00:39:08,038 --> 00:39:09,758
I won't let him go with you.

578
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:12,678
Are you sure?

579
00:39:20,398 --> 00:39:20,958
Argh!

580
00:39:21,118 --> 00:39:21,718
Argh!

581
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:22,518
Ouch!

582
00:39:23,078 --> 00:39:24,398
The audacity you have...

583
00:39:28,718 --> 00:39:29,718
Let's go home, Fah.

584
00:39:29,758 --> 00:39:31,158
- Let go of me.
- Stop it.

585
00:39:31,678 --> 00:39:33,718
She deserves another slap for her audacity.

586
00:39:34,518 --> 00:39:35,558
Fah, let's go home.

587
00:39:35,598 --> 00:39:36,398
Stop.

588
00:39:37,518 --> 00:39:38,398
Go home, Fah.

589
00:39:38,758 --> 00:39:39,518
Tor...

590
00:39:39,558 --> 00:39:40,798
Please, Tor.

591
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:42,158
Please don't leave me.

592
00:39:42,198 --> 00:39:43,398
Stay with me, okay?

593
00:39:45,198 --> 00:39:46,278
- Let me go!
- Ouch!

594
00:39:50,278 --> 00:39:51,558
Someone like you

595
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,498
will only ever be a mistress
for the rest of your life.

596
00:39:55,318 --> 00:39:56,838
Don't let me see your face again.

597
00:39:57,398 --> 00:39:58,398
Come now.

598
00:39:58,878 --> 00:39:59,678
Tor...

599
00:39:59,918 --> 00:40:00,838
Tor...

600
00:40:10,098 --> 00:40:11,438
The first time might've been a mistake,

601
00:40:11,598 --> 00:40:12,758
but if it happens again...

602
00:40:12,798 --> 00:40:14,038
I guess...

603
00:40:15,438 --> 00:40:16,678
I'd rather not say anything.

604
00:40:16,798 --> 00:40:17,718
Let's leave it like that.

605
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:20,318
She must've chosen how to live her life.

606
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:21,798
And she won't listen.

607
00:40:22,438 --> 00:40:23,318
Right,

608
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:25,718
have you seen that news about Thawat?

609
00:40:26,798 --> 00:40:27,718
I haven't.

610
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:28,958
What is it about?

611
00:40:28,998 --> 00:40:30,958
Yet another scandal, guys.
[Thawat Denied Getting a Woman Pregnant]

612
00:40:30,998 --> 00:40:34,798
Thawat has gotten Miss A pregnant
and is not owning up to it.

613
00:40:34,838 --> 00:40:37,398
Apparently, this isn't the first time, either.

614
00:40:37,438 --> 00:40:40,558
He's done this several times before.

615
00:40:40,598 --> 00:40:42,918
Getting someone pregnant
and refusing responsibility? That's awful.

616
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:44,038
Exactly.

617
00:40:44,078 --> 00:40:44,998
As a man,

618
00:40:45,038 --> 00:40:47,638
acting like this is definitely not gentlemanly.

619
00:40:48,578 --> 00:40:49,958
Fortunately,

620
00:40:49,998 --> 00:40:52,398
our daughter didn't end up
with this terrible guy.

621
00:40:53,198 --> 00:40:54,478
You're right.

622
00:41:01,678 --> 00:41:03,198
- Mr. Thawat...
- Hey, Mr. Thawat...

623
00:41:03,238 --> 00:41:04,758
Mr. Thawat, may we interview you?

624
00:41:04,918 --> 00:41:06,158
Can we interview you?

625
00:41:06,198 --> 00:41:07,758
Is it true that you got a woman pregnant

626
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:08,558
and aren't owning up to it?

627
00:41:08,598 --> 00:41:09,678
- Is it true?
- Answer us.

628
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:11,198
- Is it true?
- Mr. Thawat...

629
00:41:11,238 --> 00:41:12,398
- Tell us.
- Is it true?

630
00:41:12,438 --> 00:41:13,398
Who is the woman?

631
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:14,438
Has it been long?

632
00:41:14,478 --> 00:41:16,558
- Mr. Thawat...
- I have nothing to say.

633
00:41:16,838 --> 00:41:18,038
But we have evidence

634
00:41:18,078 --> 00:41:19,318
- Mr. Thawat...
- that confirms it's you.

635
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:20,958
- Mr. Thawat...
- We've got proof it's you.

636
00:41:23,518 --> 00:41:24,638
Serves him right.

637
00:41:24,678 --> 00:41:25,918
It's honestly satisfying.

638
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:27,238
What goes around

639
00:41:27,278 --> 00:41:28,278
always comes around.

640
00:41:28,698 --> 00:41:29,598
Exactly.

641
00:41:31,818 --> 00:41:33,278
The bad times are over.

642
00:41:33,318 --> 00:41:34,918
I want to hear something good now.

643
00:41:35,238 --> 00:41:36,398
Both of you,

644
00:41:36,438 --> 00:41:37,918
when will we hear good news?

645
00:41:39,718 --> 00:41:42,278
Are you just gonna be that frank, Sita?

646
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:44,958
No need to beat around the bush, right?

647
00:41:49,278 --> 00:41:50,638
As soon as there is any,

648
00:41:50,678 --> 00:41:52,638
I'll let you guys know right away.

649
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:54,798
Right, Prem?

650
00:41:56,278 --> 00:41:57,078
Yes.

651
00:41:59,038 --> 00:42:00,318
Alright, cheers.

652
00:42:00,358 --> 00:42:01,958
- Let's cheers.
- We literally just drank.

655
00:42:49,103 --> 00:42:50,023
Bow...

656
00:42:51,583 --> 00:42:52,583
Wakey-wakey.

657
00:42:56,863 --> 00:42:58,143
Is it time?

658
00:42:58,423 --> 00:43:00,063
It is. We might be late, you know.

659
00:43:06,743 --> 00:43:08,423
There's still some time.

660
00:43:08,743 --> 00:43:10,703
Can we stay like this a little longer?

661
00:43:11,103 --> 00:43:12,383
We can't.

662
00:43:12,803 --> 00:43:13,903
It's late.

663
00:43:14,423 --> 00:43:16,743
Why would you be so pretty this early, then?

664
00:43:18,583 --> 00:43:20,263
It's hard to hold back, you know?

665
00:43:21,623 --> 00:43:23,583
With that compliment,
what are you hoping for?

666
00:43:24,343 --> 00:43:25,943
And what could I possibly get?

667
00:43:27,823 --> 00:43:29,063
This is so frustrating.

668
00:43:29,343 --> 00:43:30,583
You're this good at sweet-talking.

669
00:43:30,623 --> 00:43:32,863
Have you been practicing on other girls?

670
00:43:33,163 --> 00:43:34,343
No, I haven't.

671
00:43:34,383 --> 00:43:35,943
You're the only one I have.

672
00:43:38,503 --> 00:43:39,943
I love you, Sita.

673
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,503
I love you, too.

674

You forgot your files at home?

684

I'm available.

685
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,903
I'll go get them

686
00:44:43,143 --> 00:44:45,263
and give them to you at the hospital.

687
00:44:48,543 --> 00:44:49,463
Okay.

689
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,743
Please marry me.

690
00:46:07,983 --> 00:46:09,863
You gave me your ring as a promise.

691
00:46:11,263 --> 00:46:12,823

00:46:27,523 --> 00:46:28,663
Of course, I will.

Thank you, Prem.

I thought you'd never want
to get married again.

699

If the one I'm marrying is you,
