1
00:00:19,534 --> 00:00:21,014
Do you believe now

2
00:00:21,578 --> 00:00:22,894
that I'm genuinely into you?

3
00:00:22,934 --> 00:00:23,934
No, no, no...

4
00:00:24,494 --> 00:00:25,374
It's not happening.

5
00:00:33,814 --> 00:00:34,694
No, no, no...

6
00:00:37,094 --> 00:00:38,374
I'm just feeling unwell.

7
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,574
The breakfast for my beautiful doctor
is served.

8
00:01:48,614 --> 00:01:51,694
Eat up and don't forget your medicine.

9
00:01:54,594 --> 00:01:56,174
Such familiar handwriting...

10
00:02:37,414 --> 00:02:40,054
We're serving hot tea this morning!

11
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:41,567
- It's about Pat.
- Ooh!

12
00:02:41,607 --> 00:02:43,494
Spill, sis!

13
00:02:43,574 --> 00:02:45,134
She totally flaked out on an event

14
00:02:45,174 --> 00:02:46,974
and ruined everything!

15
00:02:47,014 --> 00:02:48,774
People have criticized her so much
["Pat" flaking out, resulting in a ban]

16
00:02:48,814 --> 00:02:50,894
that #CancelingPat is trending on X!

17
00:02:59,334 --> 00:03:01,094
It's a misunderstanding, Bee.

18
00:03:01,134 --> 00:03:02,734
I no longer have a manager,

19
00:03:02,774 --> 00:03:04,094
so there's been some confusion.

20
00:03:04,614 --> 00:03:06,574
Set the record straight for me, would you?

21
00:03:06,614 --> 00:03:08,374
I'll only talk to you from now on.

22
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:17,774
Right now, netizens are damning Pat

23
00:03:17,814 --> 00:03:20,214
as an adult

24
00:03:20,254 --> 00:03:22,047
who handled her responsibilities
like a child.

25
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:24,254
Right, let's not jump to conclusions

26
00:03:24,294 --> 00:03:27,134
and see what Pat has to say for herself.

27
00:03:29,974 --> 00:03:30,774
Nam!

28
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,694
I didn't think it was gonna be so big

29
00:03:39,734 --> 00:03:41,374
that you'd lose your reputation!

30
00:03:41,534 --> 00:03:43,214
You didn't think,
or did you plan it all out?

31
00:03:43,434 --> 00:03:44,974
What are you trying to say?

32
00:03:45,194 --> 00:03:46,974
If you didn't mean to discredit me,

33
00:03:47,014 --> 00:03:49,094
you wouldn't have said

34
00:03:49,314 --> 00:03:52,007
you couldn't reach me
and blamed me for ruining the event.

35
00:03:52,047 --> 00:03:53,734
If you really meant well,

36
00:03:54,854 --> 00:03:56,494
you would've returned
the payment to the event manager

37
00:03:56,534 --> 00:03:58,054
and turned down the gig entirely.

38
00:03:58,694 --> 00:04:00,534
I was swarmed by the reporters,

39
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,494
so I panicked.

40
00:04:01,534 --> 00:04:03,214
I didn't have time to think!

41
00:04:03,894 --> 00:04:06,134
- I'm sorry, Pat...
- Save it.

42
00:04:06,414 --> 00:04:08,614
I'm so sick of your apologies.

43
00:04:09,214 --> 00:04:12,054
Don't even think
those ever make anything better.

44
00:04:12,654 --> 00:04:14,294
What do you want me to do, then?

45
00:04:14,534 --> 00:04:16,214
Leave me alone,

46
00:04:17,374 --> 00:04:19,054
and never see each other again.

47
00:04:19,254 --> 00:04:20,075
Pat!

48
00:04:20,854 --> 00:04:22,414
This is the only way

49
00:04:22,454 --> 00:04:24,454
I can forgive you

50
00:04:24,674 --> 00:04:26,934
and still have any good thoughts left.

51
00:04:28,294 --> 00:04:29,174
Fine,

52
00:04:29,614 --> 00:04:30,854
this is how you want it to be?

53
00:04:31,894 --> 00:04:33,734
Then, I have nothing more to say.

54
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:24,894
Pat, are you tired?

55
00:05:25,854 --> 00:05:27,374
Not at all.

56
00:05:27,414 --> 00:05:29,380
- Here, take a sip.
- Sure.

57
00:05:32,774 --> 00:05:34,414
Let me turn on the fan for you.

58
00:05:45,974 --> 00:05:47,294
I love you.

59
00:05:48,134 --> 00:05:49,534
Do you know

60
00:05:49,574 --> 00:05:51,494
you're the most important person
in my life?

61
00:05:56,054 --> 00:05:57,574
But I really love him.

62
00:05:58,434 --> 00:06:00,374
I can't live without him, Pat!

63
00:06:00,414 --> 00:06:02,614
He's the only one I want!

64
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,654
It's all because of her!

65
00:06:09,694 --> 00:06:12,334
That witch is the reason
I ended up like this!

66
00:06:13,734 --> 00:06:15,454
It's time you come to your senses, Pat.

67
00:06:25,214 --> 00:06:27,414
The entire industry seems to be fed up.
[Pat Napak, a thoughtless villainess]

68
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:28,894
- Everyone is cursing her out.
- With behavior like this,

69
00:06:28,934 --> 00:06:30,374
she deserves it.

70
00:06:30,934 --> 00:06:31,814
Right?

71
00:06:32,074 --> 00:06:33,734
Completely irresponsible!

72
00:06:33,854 --> 00:06:35,194
What a selfish woman!

73
00:06:35,234 --> 00:06:37,614
She won't even apologize
for ruining the event.

74
00:06:37,894 --> 00:06:39,654
She's the scum of the earth.

75
00:06:41,814 --> 00:06:42,534
Hey.

76
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:44,534
Oops, Doctor...

77
00:06:44,814 --> 00:06:46,848
Do you know her personally,
making all those comments?

78
00:06:46,888 --> 00:06:49,694
No, I've just heard the news.

79
00:06:49,914 --> 00:06:51,414
You've just heard the news,

80
00:06:51,734 --> 00:06:54,454
yet you spoke about her
as if she were a convicted felon.

81
00:06:54,494 --> 00:06:56,614
Be wise in your news consumption.

82
00:06:56,654 --> 00:06:59,094
Don't judge anyone
before you know the whole truth.

83
00:06:59,574 --> 00:07:00,454
- Right.
- Right.

84
00:07:01,414 --> 00:07:02,534
Meal break is over.

85
00:07:02,574 --> 00:07:03,574
Go back to work, you two.

86
00:07:04,074 --> 00:07:05,494
- Of course.
- Absolutely.

87
00:07:11,894 --> 00:07:12,887
What's the matter?

88
00:07:12,927 --> 00:07:14,134
Why would you protect that woman?

89
00:07:15,494 --> 00:07:17,654
Did you forget she ruined your wedding?

90
00:07:18,974 --> 00:07:21,414
I just despise wrongdoing.

91
00:07:21,714 --> 00:07:23,014
Besides,

92
00:07:23,054 --> 00:07:24,334
that's fake news.

93
00:07:24,814 --> 00:07:26,654
I think it's time I asked you these:

94
00:07:26,694 --> 00:07:27,934
how do you know her,

95
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:29,774
how well do you know her,

96
00:07:29,814 --> 00:07:31,774
and how confident are you that it's fake?

97
00:07:33,894 --> 00:07:36,934
I don't know her all too well.

98
00:07:37,614 --> 00:07:39,694
I was just giving them a piece of my mind.

99
00:07:43,514 --> 00:07:44,934
Are you hiding something from me?

100
00:07:45,414 --> 00:07:46,254
No,

101
00:07:46,774 --> 00:07:47,854
what would I hide from you?

102
00:07:49,214 --> 00:07:50,214
I'm going back to work.

103
00:07:58,794 --> 00:07:59,614
Prem!

104
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:02,414
Just hang on, Prem.

105
00:08:03,094 --> 00:08:03,894
Prem!

106
00:08:04,294 --> 00:08:05,494
Listen to me, Sweet Prem!

107
00:08:05,894 --> 00:08:06,534
Prem...

108
00:08:07,234 --> 00:08:07,774
Prem!

109
00:08:07,814 --> 00:08:08,814
Gosh, I'm sorry!

110
00:08:08,854 --> 00:08:09,574
I really am.

111
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:12,654
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm fine.

112
00:08:12,694 --> 00:08:13,814
I'm so sorry.

113
00:08:18,574 --> 00:08:19,654
You again?

114
00:08:19,774 --> 00:08:20,974
Are you happy to see me?

115
00:08:22,754 --> 00:08:23,754
Hey!

116
00:08:24,534 --> 00:08:26,614
I think I'm the one you should talk to.

117
00:08:28,254 --> 00:08:29,974
I can explain, Prem.

118
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:31,974
I don't think that's necessary, Thawat.

119
00:08:32,334 --> 00:08:34,487
I already saw what I needed to see.

120
00:08:34,527 --> 00:08:36,974
Are you not ashamed
of lying to my parents like that?!

121
00:08:37,654 --> 00:08:38,654
What do you want

122
00:08:39,654 --> 00:08:40,754
from all this?

123
00:08:42,234 --> 00:08:43,854
I just want you to know

124
00:08:44,574 --> 00:08:47,134
that there are no such things as secrets.

125
00:08:47,654 --> 00:08:49,574
What you do will come to light eventually.

126
00:08:50,014 --> 00:08:52,534
You can't hide
those little horns for the life of you.

127
00:08:52,854 --> 00:08:54,934
And what does that have to do with you,

128
00:08:55,694 --> 00:08:56,454
huh?

129
00:08:56,574 --> 00:08:57,854
Is it even your business?

130
00:08:59,534 --> 00:09:00,694
It is,

131
00:09:01,294 --> 00:09:03,574
because I have good intentions
toward Dr. Premsinee.

132
00:09:06,394 --> 00:09:08,534
Stop harassing her

133
00:09:08,774 --> 00:09:10,694
since you don't even seem
to feel any sort of remorse.

134
00:09:11,694 --> 00:09:14,214
If I ever see you around her again,

135
00:09:14,574 --> 00:09:17,654
I'll make sure Dr. Prem's parents
see this video.

136
00:09:51,494 --> 00:09:52,494
He left.

137
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:54,934
I'm confident

138
00:09:54,974 --> 00:09:56,734
he won't bother you ever again.

139
00:09:57,374 --> 00:09:59,287
Why are you that confident?

140
00:09:59,327 --> 00:10:00,734
Well, I just am.

141
00:10:00,974 --> 00:10:02,074
I've got it covered.

142
00:10:03,254 --> 00:10:05,134
Before dealing with
someone else's business,

143
00:10:05,974 --> 00:10:07,854
shouldn't you get yours under control?

144
00:10:07,894 --> 00:10:09,654
You read the news about me?

145
00:10:11,254 --> 00:10:12,254
Are you worried?

146
00:10:12,894 --> 00:10:13,894
I'm not.

147
00:10:15,054 --> 00:10:17,054
I just thought you were busy.

148
00:10:18,114 --> 00:10:19,854
The only thing I wanna be busy with

149
00:10:20,174 --> 00:10:21,374
is everything about you.

150
00:10:22,074 --> 00:10:23,774
I don't care about anything else.

151
00:10:24,254 --> 00:10:25,894
I'd do anything for you.

152
00:10:27,454 --> 00:10:28,974
Though...

153
00:10:29,794 --> 00:10:32,054
I'm not entirely the selfless type.

154
00:10:38,674 --> 00:10:40,054
What are you doing, Miss Pat?

155
00:10:40,274 --> 00:10:41,694
Nothing.

156
00:10:42,194 --> 00:10:43,214
It's just that...

157
00:10:43,254 --> 00:10:44,894
I've already given you a hand.

158
00:10:45,014 --> 00:10:48,334
It's time for you to return the favor.

159
00:10:49,214 --> 00:10:50,574
What do you want me to do?

160
00:10:51,014 --> 00:10:52,694
This evening...

161
00:10:52,734 --> 00:10:54,534
you have to come have dinner with me.

162
00:11:03,054 --> 00:11:04,094
I'll be busy.

163
00:11:04,334 --> 00:11:06,814
The best I can give you is...

164
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:08,050
my thanks.

165
00:11:08,654 --> 00:11:10,374
And if you expect something in return,

166
00:11:10,574 --> 00:11:12,134
don't even bother next time.

167
00:11:26,174 --> 00:11:26,974
Prem,

168
00:11:27,414 --> 00:11:28,734
you're feeling better, right?

169
00:11:29,874 --> 00:11:31,054
I am.

170
00:11:31,854 --> 00:11:33,247
I'm back to my normal eating

171
00:11:33,287 --> 00:11:34,727
and working routine.

172
00:11:34,767 --> 00:11:38,294
So I guess
we don't have to be worried anymore?

173
00:11:38,934 --> 00:11:39,614
Mm.

174
00:11:40,814 --> 00:11:42,134
It's time to move on!

175
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:44,974
Why not try a new dating pool?

176
00:11:45,614 --> 00:11:46,614
Someone from that table...

177
00:11:47,334 --> 00:11:49,494
has been staring at you
since you walked in.

178
00:11:53,574 --> 00:11:56,374
Maybe a woman will make you feel
more secure than some pathetic men.

179
00:11:56,814 --> 00:11:57,614
Bow,

180
00:11:58,494 --> 00:12:00,094
you're convincing people
to join the club again.

181
00:12:00,494 --> 00:12:02,414
Anyway, which table was that?

182
00:12:32,474 --> 00:12:34,054
Keep talking,

183
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:36,934
I'll go to the restroom.

184
00:12:51,974 --> 00:12:52,894
Hey!

185
00:12:53,334 --> 00:12:54,134
Miss...

Doc...

189
00:13:06,694 --> 00:13:07,814
Were you following me?

190
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,334
I wasn't...

191
00:13:10,934 --> 00:13:13,054
You refused to have dinner with me

192
00:13:13,414 --> 00:13:15,134
just to come here…

193
00:13:19,214 --> 00:13:20,374
Keep it together!

194
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,244
How come you're this drunk?

195
00:13:30,214 --> 00:13:31,414

I love this one.

197
00:13:35,934 --> 00:13:37,134
Hey!

198
00:13:38,454 --> 00:13:40,814
You can't just bother people
like this when you're drunk!

199
00:13:42,654 --> 00:13:45,334
You say it like
you could take care of yourself.

200
00:13:45,494 --> 00:13:47,134
I most definitely can.

201
00:13:47,774 --> 00:13:49,534
I've never bothered anyone ever before.

202
00:13:52,934 --> 00:13:53,934
What's so funny?

203
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:03,084
Who was it

204
00:14:03,124 --> 00:14:05,054
that got so drunk she got in the wrong car?

205
00:14:15,534 --> 00:14:16,854
You're a doctor;

206
00:14:17,154 --> 00:14:19,214
shouldn't you be the one
with a good memory?

207
00:14:22,614 --> 00:14:24,054
Tonight,

208
00:14:24,094 --> 00:14:27,214
don't get in anyone else's car
if you get drunk.

209
00:14:38,974 --> 00:14:41,294
- Bottoms up!
- Bottoms up!

210
00:15:20,094 --> 00:15:21,094
Excuse me,

211
00:15:22,294 --> 00:15:23,694
but the woman you have your eye on

212
00:15:24,334 --> 00:15:25,534
is already taken.

213
00:15:57,854 --> 00:16:00,094
What brings you here, Doc?

214
00:16:00,494 --> 00:16:02,694
How do you know
I got in the wrong car that night?

215
00:16:05,734 --> 00:16:07,614
Did I blurt that out last night?

216
00:16:07,654 --> 00:16:08,404
Yes,

217
00:16:09,174 --> 00:16:10,734
now please answer my question.

218
00:16:12,134 --> 00:16:13,454
Right here?

219
00:16:13,734 --> 00:16:15,054
Just shoot it.

220
00:16:18,954 --> 00:16:20,454
If you want to catch a tiger cub,

221
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,254
you need to enter the tiger's den.

222
00:16:23,134 --> 00:16:24,854
Do you have the guts?

223
00:16:44,014 --> 00:16:45,454
Are you gonna answer me now?

224
00:16:45,814 --> 00:16:47,814
What if I tell you...

225
00:16:48,654 --> 00:16:50,854
I was the one helping you that night?

226
00:16:52,294 --> 00:16:54,054
Then, why didn't you mention it before?

227
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:56,814
Well, I wasn't sure

228
00:16:57,494 --> 00:16:59,294
that if I did,

229
00:16:59,534 --> 00:17:01,694
you'd like me

230
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:04,214
or hate me even more.

231
00:17:04,894 --> 00:17:06,694
I guess it's the latter

232
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,574
since I dislike insincere people.

233
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:11,734
And if you knew it all along
but still decided not to say anything,

234
00:17:12,014 --> 00:17:13,974
that means you were trying
to hide it from me.

235
00:17:14,914 --> 00:17:16,094
Don't you see?

236
00:17:16,414 --> 00:17:18,134
I've already told you

237
00:17:19,374 --> 00:17:22,054
I was the one helping you that night.

238
00:17:22,774 --> 00:17:25,934
Is it finally time
you give me your attention?

239
00:17:25,974 --> 00:17:27,094
Hey,

240
00:17:28,074 --> 00:17:30,694
are you seriously gonna try
to get my attention this way?

241
00:17:33,334 --> 00:17:34,534
Does it work?

242
00:17:35,214 --> 00:17:36,054
It does,

243
00:17:37,454 --> 00:17:38,614
in a horrible sense.

244
00:17:39,494 --> 00:17:40,694
I don't know

245
00:17:40,734 --> 00:17:43,174
if you're really the person who saved me

246
00:17:44,154 --> 00:17:45,694
or just pretending to be

247
00:17:46,014 --> 00:17:47,654
because one thing I know

248
00:17:48,214 --> 00:17:50,294
is that they were a more decent person.

249
00:17:57,394 --> 00:17:59,654

- Hi, there.
- Hi.

261
00:19:13,334 --> 00:19:14,924
I hope you're doing well, Doc?

00:19:14,964 --> 00:19:16,214
I am, Uncle.

263
00:19:17,134 --> 00:19:19,334
Should we start with the exam?

264
00:19:19,744 --> 00:19:20,454
Sure.

- Honey!
- What?!

Look, if the doctor
also likes our daughter,

293
00:21:01,574 --> 00:21:04,694
then that means
she's going to be our daughter-in-law!

you need to do as I ask.

335
00:23:39,915 --> 00:23:41,395
Then, I don't want it anymore.

336
00:23:41,995 --> 00:23:42,995
You can have it.

337
00:23:47,115 --> 00:23:48,915
Why is it so hard to win your heart?

338
00:23:49,175 --> 00:23:50,395
If it is, just quit.

339
00:23:52,635 --> 00:23:54,715
Or is the reason
you built your wall so high

340
00:23:55,315 --> 00:23:56,915
because you're afraid
you'll fall for me?

341
00:24:02,495 --> 00:24:03,755

353

Yes.

355
00:25:33,595 --> 00:25:34,595
So...

356

00:25:39,275 --> 00:25:40,275
Not really,

You're trying to talk to me!

362

367
00:26:06,235 --> 00:26:07,235

of being more than a neighbor.

372
00:26:18,475 --> 00:26:19,475
Prem.

373
00:26:41,195 --> 00:26:42,715
You actually ate it!

374
00:26:49,595 --> 00:26:50,875
This is like a date.

375
00:26:51,435 --> 00:26:52,955
I don't see how it is.

376
00:26:55,975 --> 00:26:57,435
Well, how is it not like a date?

377
00:26:57,475 --> 00:26:58,275
Well...

378
00:26:59,475 --> 00:27:00,715
In the sense that...

379
00:27:02,435 --> 00:27:03,995
this is not romantic or anything.

Well...

388
00:27:59,275 --> 00:28:00,675
why did you use your tongue, Pat!

389
00:28:01,335 --> 00:28:03,355
So it's as romantic as a date.

390
00:28:05,355 --> 00:28:06,955
You called me Pat?

391
00:28:08,795 --> 00:28:11,315
Does this mean we're close?

392
00:28:11,555 --> 00:28:12,555
No!

You kissed me first!

396
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:21,835
But you kissed me back, didn't you?

397
00:28:22,195 --> 00:28:23,355
Twice already.

398
00:28:26,575 --> 00:28:27,795
What are you talking about?

399
00:28:28,855 --> 00:28:30,595
No, it's actually three times…

00:28:31,115 --> 00:28:33,235
if we count the time
you got in the wrong car.

401
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:37,875
I was heavily drunk that night.

402
00:28:40,155 --> 00:28:41,715
But you're not now.

403
00:28:42,075 --> 00:28:42,955
Uh...

404
00:28:42,995 --> 00:28:44,355
Thank you for dinner.

405
00:28:46,715 --> 00:28:47,955
Are you leaving?

00:28:48,755 --> 00:28:49,915

I'm full.

That's someone with a trembling heart.

Didn't you say you wanna get to know me?

419
00:29:50,835 --> 00:29:52,875
Why did you run away all of a sudden?

420
00:29:53,155 --> 00:29:54,475
I wasn't running away.

421
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:57,315
I was... full.

What?

426
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:06,555
So...

427
00:30:07,675 --> 00:30:09,355
My A/C broke down,

428
00:30:09,395 --> 00:30:11,035
and the water isn't running.

429
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:13,195
Can I bother you just for one night?

430
00:30:15,775 --> 00:30:17,195
Please...

431
00:30:18,115 --> 00:30:18,915
Please?

432
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:25,915
Fine.

433
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:29,315
So, where do you want me to take a shower?

434
00:30:31,195 --> 00:30:32,195
There.

435
00:30:32,235 --> 00:30:34,238
The bathroom on the left.

436
00:30:35,715 --> 00:30:36,595
Sure.

437
00:30:40,235 --> 00:30:41,155
What are you waiting for?

438
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,035
It's over there!

439
00:30:48,195 --> 00:30:49,715
My A/C really did break down.

440
00:30:50,075 --> 00:30:51,995
- Mm.
- And the water isn't running either...

441
00:30:52,035 --> 00:30:53,195
I know!

442
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:58,635
Why are you in my room?!

443
00:30:59,395 --> 00:31:00,675
The bathroom is there!

444
00:31:17,515 --> 00:31:19,595
"If you really get to know Pat,

445
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,955
you'll realize how lovely

446
00:31:22,395 --> 00:31:23,875
and understanding she is."

447
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:26,555
How on earth?

448
00:31:35,795 --> 00:31:37,435
Who said you can be here?

449
00:31:39,075 --> 00:31:41,195
Well, where do you expect me
to sleep, Prem?

450
00:31:43,155 --> 00:31:44,315
The couch.

451
00:31:44,555 --> 00:31:46,035
But the other day,

452
00:31:46,075 --> 00:31:49,635
it gave me really, really bad back pain!

453
00:31:50,755 --> 00:31:51,755
Right here.

454
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:58,435
I'm off to bed, then.

455
00:32:04,235 --> 00:32:06,075
Don't sleep late, Prem,

456
00:32:06,315 --> 00:32:09,595
or you'll get wrinkles!

457
00:32:10,035 --> 00:32:10,835
Hey!

458
00:32:15,255 --> 00:32:16,255
Prem...

459
00:32:18,035 --> 00:32:19,915
do you think...

460
00:32:20,895 --> 00:32:23,315
I could leave my robe...

461
00:32:26,155 --> 00:32:27,395
somewhere?

462
00:32:30,555 --> 00:32:31,475
Over there.

463
00:32:38,275 --> 00:32:39,275
Where?

464
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:41,254
On the rack right there.

465
00:32:47,315 --> 00:32:49,035
Don't you have anything better to wear?

466
00:32:51,315 --> 00:32:52,635
Do you not like it, Prem?

467
00:32:54,035 --> 00:32:56,555
Or do I look bad in it?

468
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:59,555
Why does it matter if I like it or not?

469
00:32:59,715 --> 00:33:02,995
Well, I picked this for you, Prem!

470
00:33:04,275 --> 00:33:05,995
That kind of sleepwear
isn't really my cup of tea.

471
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:10,955
Then...

472
00:33:13,435 --> 00:33:15,835
what kind of sleepwear do you like?

473
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:22,835
What kind?

474
00:33:40,035 --> 00:33:41,795
Are you not removing your robe, Prem?

475
00:33:46,355 --> 00:33:48,075
Are you going to bed?

476
00:33:51,115 --> 00:33:52,115
That's standoffish.

477
00:33:53,215 --> 00:33:55,635
I'll turn off the lights, then.

478
00:33:56,755 --> 00:33:57,635
Mm.

479
00:34:26,955 --> 00:34:28,195
Could you move further away?

480
00:34:37,355 --> 00:34:38,555
Don't worry,

481
00:34:39,355 --> 00:34:40,835
I won't do anything to you, Prem...

482
00:34:45,035 --> 00:34:47,075
unless you want to.

483
00:35:40,976 --> 00:35:42,256
Here you go, Doctor.

484
00:35:42,536 --> 00:35:43,976
Thank you, Nurse Ratee.

485
00:35:49,016 --> 00:35:49,936
Prem!

486
00:35:50,976 --> 00:35:52,736
Why do you look so tired?

487
00:35:52,896 --> 00:35:55,536
You seem pretty drained lately, Doctor.

488
00:35:55,756 --> 00:35:57,056
Didn't you get enough sleep?

489
00:36:05,776 --> 00:36:07,416
Do you like this dress, Prem?

490
00:36:13,456 --> 00:36:14,696
Then...

491
00:36:15,496 --> 00:36:16,776
how about this?

492
00:37:03,736 --> 00:37:04,936
How about this?

493
00:37:05,616 --> 00:37:06,616
Do you like it now?

494
00:37:25,036 --> 00:37:27,776
I'm training myself to fight a demon.

495
00:37:34,016 --> 00:37:36,296
What would it take for Prem to want me?

496
00:37:36,336 --> 00:37:37,136
What?!

497
00:37:39,736 --> 00:37:41,016
Why are you so dramatic?

498
00:37:41,056 --> 00:37:42,536
How could I not be?

499
00:37:42,576 --> 00:37:43,976
Listen to what you just said!

500
00:37:44,656 --> 00:37:45,816
The audacity!

501
00:37:47,656 --> 00:37:48,856
Fortune favors the bold, am I right?

502
00:37:49,396 --> 00:37:52,536
Right now, I think
Prem is starting to have feelings for me,

503
00:37:52,936 --> 00:37:54,136
but...

504
00:37:55,176 --> 00:37:56,176
I don't know why

505
00:37:56,916 --> 00:37:59,496
even when I wear see-through
slip dresses for her every night,

506
00:37:59,696 --> 00:38:01,336
she never seems interested.

507
00:38:01,976 --> 00:38:02,976
Pat,

508
00:38:03,016 --> 00:38:05,896
did you forget
that she's never been into women?

509
00:38:06,696 --> 00:38:08,496
Maybe she's just confused.

510
00:38:09,656 --> 00:38:10,936
Confused?

511
00:38:10,976 --> 00:38:11,856
Yes!

512
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:16,256
She's probably just realized
that she can fall for women, too.

513
00:38:22,136 --> 00:38:24,696
Look, you need to be more patient.

514
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:27,896
That doctor of yours
thought she only liked men all her life.

515
00:38:28,636 --> 00:38:29,936
Give her some time.

516
00:38:37,736 --> 00:38:38,616
Hey,

517
00:38:40,256 --> 00:38:41,776
could I ask you something?

518
00:38:41,816 --> 00:38:43,936
How did you two realize you like women?

519
00:38:44,256 --> 00:38:45,416
Hm...

520
00:38:45,896 --> 00:38:48,576
I don't think it's much different
from straight relationships.

521
00:38:49,096 --> 00:38:50,856
It can start pretty simply,

522
00:38:51,176 --> 00:38:53,896
like wanting to be close to someone

523
00:38:53,976 --> 00:38:57,376
despite how naughty they might be.

524
00:38:57,936 --> 00:38:59,416
Sita!

525
00:38:59,816 --> 00:39:01,216
Prem, why would you ask that?

526
00:39:02,296 --> 00:39:03,976
Just answer me, Bow.

527
00:39:06,616 --> 00:39:07,616
What about you?

528
00:39:07,936 --> 00:39:09,696
How did you know you were into Sita?

529
00:39:09,976 --> 00:39:11,256
Well...

530
00:39:12,776 --> 00:39:14,056
I became possessive of her.

531
00:39:15,296 --> 00:39:16,776
I didn't want anyone near her.

532
00:39:18,116 --> 00:39:19,416
Why do you ask, though?

533
00:39:20,456 --> 00:39:21,376
Well,

534
00:39:21,416 --> 00:39:23,896
I'm not blessed with
as much love experience as you are.

535
00:39:23,936 --> 00:39:25,816
Prem, watch it!

536
00:39:28,376 --> 00:39:29,736
I'm simply just asking.

537
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,816
Never a break for Pat Napak,

538
00:39:35,856 --> 00:39:38,056
who allegedly flaked on an event.

539
00:39:38,096 --> 00:39:39,456
Recently, sis,

540
00:39:39,496 --> 00:39:41,496
hot tea about her being a mistress
has just been served!

541
00:39:41,536 --> 00:39:44,296
Sources even provide

542
00:39:44,336 --> 00:39:47,816
that the girlfriend of the male actor
in question is extremely upset

543
00:39:47,856 --> 00:39:49,791
'cause she always suspects
[Pat's secret affair at her condo]

544
00:39:49,796 --> 00:39:51,273
that her boyfriend

545
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:54,936
secretly fooled around
with Pat at her condo at 3 A.M.!

546
00:39:55,416 --> 00:39:56,736
What kind of person

547
00:39:57,136 --> 00:39:58,576
is that messed up in every way?

548
00:39:59,295 --> 00:40:00,696
I saw people talking on X

549
00:40:00,736 --> 00:40:02,016
that she is the biggest player.

550
00:40:02,936 --> 00:40:05,336
Be careful of the pot
calling the kettle black, Bow.

551
00:40:12,816 --> 00:40:15,176
Insider says she sleeps around.

552
00:40:15,216 --> 00:40:17,856
Her condo is basically a love nest.

553
00:40:25,816 --> 00:40:27,896
Do you really have to show
this much cleavage?

554
00:40:34,256 --> 00:40:36,176
It's not what you think, Prem!

555
00:40:36,216 --> 00:40:37,856
No need for any explanation.

556
00:40:43,136 --> 00:40:45,336
Ticha, why didn't you
wear your bra properly!?

557
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,616
Who knew the doctor would be here?!

558
00:40:58,256 --> 00:40:59,895
The woman earlier was Ticha,

559
00:40:59,935 --> 00:41:01,536
a really good friend of mine.

560
00:41:02,496 --> 00:41:03,776
Stop with the excuses.

561
00:41:03,976 --> 00:41:05,616
A good friend or not,

562
00:41:05,656 --> 00:41:06,936
I don't care.

563
00:41:08,136 --> 00:41:10,216
Well, you seem to be mad at me!

564
00:41:14,216 --> 00:41:15,496
Or are you actually jealous?

565
00:41:17,096 --> 00:41:19,216
Wait, but if you are,

566
00:41:19,256 --> 00:41:20,696
that means you like...

567
00:41:21,976 --> 00:41:23,209
I don't like you.

568
00:41:23,242 --> 00:41:24,616
I was just playing along,

569
00:41:24,656 --> 00:41:25,656
nothing serious.

570
00:41:26,936 --> 00:41:28,056
From now on,

571
00:41:28,096 --> 00:41:29,616
don't come spend the night
at my place again.

572
00:41:48,136 --> 00:41:49,136
That's enough.

573
00:41:49,976 --> 00:41:51,776
I'm done wasting my time with you.

575

Prem!

576
00:42:00,836 --> 00:42:01,836
Prem!

577
00:42:02,816 --> 00:42:05,856
♫It's gonna cut deep, I know♫

578
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:09,886
♫I'm not supposed to yield,♫

579
00:42:10,046 --> 00:42:13,586
♫But the closer to you, the more I feel♫

580
00:42:13,626 --> 00:42:16,706
♫As much as I want to hide,♫

581
00:42:17,036 --> 00:42:20,196
♫I run back to your sight♫

582
00:42:20,316 --> 00:42:24,836
♫Heavenly, yet it's hell,♫

♫No way to tear it apart♫

586
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:39,776
This is cozy.

587
00:42:40,696 --> 00:42:42,896
What did you do?

588
00:42:43,016 --> 00:42:44,536
Why are you so cuddly?

589
00:42:45,056 --> 00:42:46,576
Jeez, Sita,

590
00:42:46,616 --> 00:42:47,976
I didn't do anything.

591
00:42:48,976 --> 00:42:49,976
Just kidding.

592
00:42:52,156 --> 00:42:53,416
Sita,

593
00:42:54,116 --> 00:42:55,656
I'm worried about Prem.

594
00:42:56,796 --> 00:42:58,336
Prem is a grown adult.

595
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:00,576
She's gonna figure it out.

596
00:43:02,936 --> 00:43:05,056
I'm just worried
she's gonna stay single forever.

597
00:43:05,676 --> 00:43:06,976
That's fine, too.

598
00:43:08,176 --> 00:43:11,376
She's not the lonely type like you are.

599
00:43:13,156 --> 00:43:14,536
Again!

600
00:43:14,576 --> 00:43:16,256
I'm always getting roasted!

601
00:43:16,856 --> 00:43:18,376
Don't you worry.

602
00:43:19,576 --> 00:43:23,296
I know Prem will have
enough courage to love again,

603
00:43:25,016 --> 00:43:27,776
with someone who can drive
her painful memories away.

604
00:43:31,616 --> 00:43:33,456
Thank you so much, Sita.

605
00:43:59,096 --> 00:44:03,416
[RAM2 Hospital]

606
00:44:32,176 --> 00:44:33,696
Can I see the doctor now?

607
00:44:33,985 --> 00:44:34,896
Uh...

608
00:44:34,936 --> 00:44:37,056
she's still with a patient.

609
00:45:07,856 --> 00:45:08,856
Doc!

610
00:45:09,776 --> 00:45:10,936
Doc!

611
00:45:12,496 --> 00:45:13,496
Doc!

612
00:47:11,277 --> 00:47:13,357
You have no right
to just barge in like that.

613
00:47:15,357 --> 00:47:16,997
I just wanna give you back your necklace.

614
00:47:17,037 --> 00:47:18,677
Why are you avoiding me, Prem?

615
00:47:18,717 --> 00:47:19,957
Because I don't want to see you.

616
00:47:20,317 --> 00:47:21,157
That's not true.

617
00:47:21,357 --> 00:47:22,797
You're lying to yourself.

618
00:47:23,097 --> 00:47:24,357
I'm not lying.

619
00:47:25,017 --> 00:47:26,237
Who are you

620
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:27,765
to know me better than I do?

621
00:47:27,805 --> 00:47:29,077
I just do

622
00:47:29,317 --> 00:47:30,997
because if you truly hated me,

623
00:47:31,237 --> 00:47:33,917
you wouldn't have let me
be this involved in your life.

624
00:47:33,957 --> 00:47:36,237
You became the chaos in my life
without even asking.

625
00:47:37,997 --> 00:47:40,437
You're driving me insane, Prem!

626
00:47:46,377 --> 00:47:48,197
Simply admitting that we like each other,

627
00:47:50,137 --> 00:47:51,717
is that so hard?

628
00:48:00,297 --> 00:48:01,717
Because if it is,

629
00:48:02,877 --> 00:48:04,837
I will stop bothering you entirely.
