1
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,730
What you're asking for is impossible.

2
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,650
I will never give you a chance.

3
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,380
Prem,

4
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,870
you and your friend should leave.

5
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,560
Let's leave, okay?

6
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,220
Pat...

7
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,850
I'm sorry

8
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,170
you had to go through all of this.

9
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,270
It's totally okay.

10
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,750
I'm sorry, too,

11
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,690
for being rash.

12
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,140
You were being brave.

13
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,120
I can be even braver, you know?

14
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,490
No matter what,

15
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,400
I'll make your parents change their minds.

16
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,670
They won't change that easily.

17
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,740
I know them better than anyone.

18
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,370
Trust me, Prem.

19
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,810
I'm good at winning people over.

20
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,290
I just don't want them
to hurt you anymore.

21
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,480
I'm so sorry.

22
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,710
I really am.

23
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,540
I feel like...

24
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,030
I can't do anything to protect you at all.

25
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,229
Just having you by my side

26
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,010
is already enough.

27
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,850
I know you're lost.

28
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,360
And I know how much you love your parents.

29
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,920
But everything's gonna be okay.

30
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,910
As long as we don't let go of each other,

31
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,280
we'll get through this.

32
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,720
Will we really get through this?

33
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,370
[RAM2 Hospital]

34
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,180
That's how it was.

35
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,700
Whoa...

36
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,350
Pat really went all out.

37
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,390
Absolutely.

38
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,470
Prem's parents are super strict.

39
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,380
I get nervous every time I meet them.

40
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,910
So...

41
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,030
how are you gonna talk to your parents?

42
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,270
I honestly have no idea.

43
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,000
My mind's completely blank.

44
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,230
Then rest for a bit.

45
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,570
Don't rush it.

46
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,020
We're always here anyway.

47
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,010
Thanks.

48
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,670
I gotta go now.

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,309
See you at noon, okay?

50
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:10,990
Okay.

51
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,770
How is Prem doing?

52
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,680
Not good, Sita.

53
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,000
This is not good, Pat.

54
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,310
I know.

55
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,000
Family matters are complicated.

56
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,520
Doctor Prem really loves her parents,

57
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,800
so it's obvious she cares about them.

58
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,900
That's why I have to make them understand.

59
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,470
How, though?

60
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,870
By giving it my all.

61
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,240
Seriously?

62
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,960
What?

63
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,440
You're gonna go against her parents,

64
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,540
but is she standing with you?

65
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,160
What do you mean by that?

66
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,500
Of course she is.

67
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,570
You sure?

68
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,860
Well, then.

69
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,430
I'm just worried

70
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,020
that you might have to face this
all by yourself.

71
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:28,036
Madam,

72
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,516
Miss Pat, the actress, is here to see you.

73
00:05:37,323 --> 00:05:38,814
Hello, Mother.

74
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,690
Just call me Auntie.

75
00:05:44,072 --> 00:05:45,418
Okay, Auntie.

76
00:05:47,287 --> 00:05:49,461
You're really brave, coming here alone.

77
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,385
I came to apologize, Auntie,

78
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,283
for my manners yesterday.

79
00:05:55,214 --> 00:05:57,025
I may have been rude

80
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,778
or have offended both of you.

81
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:04,283
I know you weren't pleased,

82
00:06:05,221 --> 00:06:07,280
and maybe you don't like me much yet,

83
00:06:07,476 --> 00:06:09,309
but I'll show you

84
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,200
how much I love Prem.

85
00:06:12,661 --> 00:06:14,089
If you really loved her,

86
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,585
you wouldn't do this.

87
00:06:17,156 --> 00:06:18,225
Right now,

88
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,105
you're making things hard for her.

89
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:24,334
She's always been obedient

90
00:06:24,335 --> 00:06:25,658
and never caused trouble.

91
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:28,989
But because of you, she's now fighting
with her parents every single day.

92
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:31,025
I know,

93
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,200
and I feel terribly guilty.

94
00:06:34,109 --> 00:06:36,660
But I just can't let go of Prem.

95
00:06:37,905 --> 00:06:40,036
Then you're even more selfish than I thought.

96
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:43,476
What do you mean, Auntie?

97
00:06:44,014 --> 00:06:45,563
Even if she chooses you,

98
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:48,298
do you think she'll be truly happy?

99
00:06:49,054 --> 00:06:50,312
I am sure

100
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,974
I can make her happy.

101
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,100
That's impossible.

102
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,320
She'll never be happy

103
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,909
if she has to disappoint her parents.

104
00:06:59,774 --> 00:07:01,447
Since all this happened,

105
00:07:01,563 --> 00:07:03,534
have you seen her smile at all?

106
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,196
No matter what you say,

107
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,722
I'm confident that

108
00:07:07,723 --> 00:07:09,898
Prem and I can go through this.

109
00:07:10,938 --> 00:07:12,889
This isn't a fairy tale

110
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,807
with a happy ending.

111
00:07:15,723 --> 00:07:17,621
I'll be honest with you.

112
00:07:17,832 --> 00:07:19,665
No matter how hard you try,

113
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:22,872
you'll never change our minds.

114
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,589
And if your love
for her is real, like you said,

115
00:07:27,374 --> 00:07:29,214
then you should step back

116
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:30,843
and let her go.

117
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:34,327
Why are you letting her come in again?

118
00:07:35,272 --> 00:07:36,029
Darling...

119
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:39,111
Please don't blame her.

120
00:07:39,112 --> 00:07:40,734
I asked to see her myself.

121
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,360
Didn't you understand what I said yesterday?

122
00:07:44,443 --> 00:07:45,020
Uncle,

123
00:07:45,243 --> 00:07:46,356
please calm down.

124
00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:49,701
It's this woman
who's causing Prem to make wrong decisions.

125
00:07:49,854 --> 00:07:51,470
I don't need to stay calm with her.

126
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:54,996
I want to apologize
for my rudeness yesterday.

127
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,807
If your apology is sincere,

128
00:07:57,316 --> 00:07:58,814
then stay away from my daughter.

129
00:08:03,134 --> 00:08:04,036
Pat,

130
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:05,985
you should leave.

131
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:08,654
Don't make the situation any worse.

132
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:10,880
I'm not trying to make it worse.

133
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,501
I just want to make it better.

134
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,847
I know both of you love Prem,

135
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,396
and I love her, too.

136
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:21,680
Can't we at least
come to some agreement for her sake?

137
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,181
The only agreement I'll make with you

138
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,160
is that you break up with her.

139
00:08:27,127 --> 00:08:27,869
That is...

140
00:08:28,283 --> 00:08:30,785
how much we love our daughter.

141
00:08:35,301 --> 00:08:36,785
I'll leave for now,

142
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,189
but I'll come back.

143
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,505
Don't come here again.

144
00:08:41,178 --> 00:08:43,330
I will never accept you.

145
00:08:44,327 --> 00:08:47,629
The only son-in-law
I'll ever accept is Krich.

146
00:09:11,665 --> 00:09:13,781
Are you trying to drive me crazy?

147
00:09:14,443 --> 00:09:16,269
You want me to lose my mind?

148
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,101
How long do you want me
to be shamed by everyone?

149
00:09:20,305 --> 00:09:22,567
I'll try to talk to our daughter.

150
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:24,407
Tell her...

151
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:26,916
if she doesn't break up with that woman,

152
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,392
we're no longer her parents.

153
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,025
Mother...

154
00:09:54,749 --> 00:09:57,580
You heard your father, didn't you?

155
00:10:01,912 --> 00:10:03,774
I'm sorry, Mother,

156
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:07,490
that you have to deal with
his temper because of me.

157
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,214
Are you just going to leave it like this?

158
00:10:13,723 --> 00:10:16,574
I'll give you some time to think it over.

159
00:10:17,454 --> 00:10:18,363
Today,

160
00:10:18,647 --> 00:10:20,174
Pat came to our house.

161
00:10:22,298 --> 00:10:24,130
Please tell her...

162
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:25,985
not to come again.

163
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:52,181
You've got a mild fever, Mother.

164
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,472
I've got a bit of a headache.

165
00:10:56,473 --> 00:10:58,460
Some rest should help.

166
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,660
Drink some water, okay?

167
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,232
You can leave for now, dear.

168
00:11:30,741 --> 00:11:32,341
Isn't your schedule busy?

169
00:11:36,094 --> 00:11:37,170
Okay.

170
00:11:39,614 --> 00:11:41,381
Rest well, Mother.

171
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,454
Right now,

172
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,340
you're making things hard for her.

173
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,763
She's always been obedient

174
00:13:42,764 --> 00:13:44,100
and never caused trouble.

175
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,580
But because of you, she's now fighting
with her parents every single day.

176
00:13:48,247 --> 00:13:49,709
Even if she chooses you,

177
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,180
do you think she'll be truly happy?

178
00:13:53,287 --> 00:13:55,052
Since all this happened,

179
00:13:55,053 --> 00:13:57,060
have you seen her smile at all?

180
00:14:00,603 --> 00:14:03,229
And if your love
for her is real, like you said,

181
00:14:04,145 --> 00:14:06,014
then you should step back

182
00:14:06,189 --> 00:14:07,621
and let her go.

183
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:43,345
Pat...

184
00:14:47,818 --> 00:14:48,509
Yes?

185
00:14:49,432 --> 00:14:50,501
Yesterday,

186
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,785
you went to my house, didn't you?

187
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:55,883
I did.

188
00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:04,283
I know you meant well, Pat,

189
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,672
but maybe you shouldn't see
my parents for a while.

190
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:10,487
They're not ready yet.

191
00:15:12,858 --> 00:15:13,738
Sure.

192
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,236
Prem...

193
00:15:26,276 --> 00:15:27,040
Yes?

194
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,287
How about...

195
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,614
we go out for a nice dinner tonight?

196
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,978
It might help you feel better.

197
00:15:34,378 --> 00:15:35,483
I think...

198
00:15:35,607 --> 00:15:38,196
I'll be having dinner with my mom.

199
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,312
I might be back late.

200
00:15:41,418 --> 00:15:42,809
You can go to bed first.

201
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,014
Don't wait for me, okay?

202
00:15:50,465 --> 00:15:51,265
Prem...

203
00:15:53,258 --> 00:15:53,832
Yes?

204
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:55,789
You still remember, don't you?

205
00:15:57,658 --> 00:15:59,250
That I'm right here.

206
00:16:01,192 --> 00:16:02,414
I'm always here

207
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:03,912
for you, Prem.

208
00:17:04,763 --> 00:17:06,569
I'm staying at home tonight.

209
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:07,556
From Prem.

210
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,287
Prem!

211
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:16,229
♫All I can do is hold back tears,
knowing our last days are near♫

212
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:21,738
♫Even though the end is what we both fear♫

213
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:29,970
♫I'm telling myself I need to face reality,♫

214
00:18:31,934 --> 00:18:33,540
I'll go take a shower.

215
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:39,009
♫It's painful going against my heart♫

216
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:42,378
♫It's painful that we have to part♫

217
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:48,865
♫All I can say is a tearful goodbye♫

218
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,508
Please have some tea.

219
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,499
Make yourself at home.

220
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,497
Well, you could've told Pat
to let us know you were coming.

221
00:19:17,498 --> 00:19:19,431
You know, so we would've been ready
to welcome you.

222
00:19:20,428 --> 00:19:22,013
I didn't tell her I was coming.

223
00:19:23,198 --> 00:19:23,817
Then...

224
00:19:23,926 --> 00:19:26,088
how did you find our home?

225
00:19:26,388 --> 00:19:27,860
I had someone track it down.

226
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:30,128
I'm here to talk about our daughters.

227
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:31,937
Whoa...

228
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:33,773
Seems we're in a hurry, huh?

229
00:19:33,778 --> 00:19:35,617
Our daughters

230
00:19:35,618 --> 00:19:36,849
have only been dating for a while.

231
00:19:37,257 --> 00:19:39,728
I want your daughter to stop seeing mine.

232
00:19:40,362 --> 00:19:41,031
Oh...

233
00:19:42,078 --> 00:19:42,660
Uh...

234
00:19:42,661 --> 00:19:45,504
Did Pat offend or upset you?

235
00:19:45,628 --> 00:19:46,537
She did not.

236
00:19:46,878 --> 00:19:48,857
I just don't want Prem to date a woman.

237
00:19:54,631 --> 00:19:56,020
If that's what this is about,

238
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:58,260
I won't stop them.

239
00:20:00,578 --> 00:20:03,308
Don't you care
about your daughter's future at all?

240
00:20:03,664 --> 00:20:04,768
Of course we do.

241
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:08,878
We care enough to want
her happiness above everything else.

242
00:20:09,562 --> 00:20:10,849
Happiness?

243
00:20:12,617 --> 00:20:14,064
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

244
00:20:14,268 --> 00:20:15,904
You're the one who's mistaken.

245
00:20:17,395 --> 00:20:19,526
Those two are just in love.

246
00:20:20,358 --> 00:20:21,860
They've done nothing wrong.

247
00:20:23,882 --> 00:20:25,460
We may differ in opinion,

248
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,926
but whatever you say,

249
00:20:28,668 --> 00:20:30,928
I'll never accept
your daughter into my family.

250
00:20:32,388 --> 00:20:34,297
I don't want any ties

251
00:20:34,298 --> 00:20:36,653
with someone
who doesn't respect my daughter, either.

252
00:20:37,315 --> 00:20:39,075
If you don't love my daughter,

253
00:20:39,078 --> 00:20:39,928
that's alright.

254
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:43,184
But both of us do. We love her.

255
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,075
And most importantly,

256
00:20:45,518 --> 00:20:47,264
they love each other.

257
00:20:49,664 --> 00:20:51,488
So you won't take my side?

258
00:20:53,446 --> 00:20:54,835
I think you should leave.

259
00:20:57,538 --> 00:20:58,224
Please.

260
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,191
Here's the medicine
you asked for, Mother.

261
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:23,860
Thanks, Prem.

262
00:21:37,688 --> 00:21:39,686
What happened to your knee?

263
00:21:44,726 --> 00:21:46,428
I had a small fall, dear.

264
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,188
It's nothing to worry about.

265
00:21:50,551 --> 00:21:52,180
Let me put a compress on it for you.

266
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,180
When you were just a kid,

267
00:22:34,435 --> 00:22:35,868
you fell,

268
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,486
and I tended to you just like this.

269
00:22:41,482 --> 00:22:42,408
Really?

270
00:22:43,097 --> 00:22:45,671
You were only two or three back then.

271
00:22:46,486 --> 00:22:47,991
I don't think you remember it.

272
00:22:49,998 --> 00:22:50,820
Yes.

273
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,620
But I remember...

274
00:22:54,195 --> 00:22:56,668
that you've always taken care of me.

275
00:23:11,478 --> 00:23:12,493
Prem...

276
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,347
You know...

277
00:23:19,348 --> 00:23:21,635
my birthday's coming up soon, don't you?

278
00:23:22,828 --> 00:23:23,875
I know, Mother.

279
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:27,693
So...

280
00:23:27,846 --> 00:23:31,504
can I be the one to ask for a gift this year?

281
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:34,362
What do you want, Mother?

282
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:37,446
What I want from you, my dear...

283
00:23:39,388 --> 00:23:41,671
is for you to stop loving women

284
00:23:42,217 --> 00:23:44,195
and try seeing Krich instead.

285
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,198
Can you do that for me, dear?

286
00:23:49,238 --> 00:23:51,795
What if I can't give you that gift?

287
00:23:56,758 --> 00:23:58,588
I'm not trying to force you,

288
00:23:59,998 --> 00:24:01,809
but I'm begging you, dear.

289
00:24:02,918 --> 00:24:03,751
I...

290
00:24:07,366 --> 00:24:08,900
Your father and I...

291
00:24:09,271 --> 00:24:10,568
love you.

292
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,477
We just want you to have a family

293
00:24:12,478 --> 00:24:14,478
and a perfect life,

294
00:24:14,988 --> 00:24:17,737
just like you once told us you dreamed of.

295
00:24:18,726 --> 00:24:20,217
But right now...

296
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:22,224
Prem,

297
00:24:22,675 --> 00:24:24,217
I've given you everything

298
00:24:25,395 --> 00:24:27,218
you've ever asked for,

299
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,398
and I've never asked for anything back.

300
00:24:30,871 --> 00:24:32,500
But this time...

301
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:37,744
can you just consider it my birthday gift?

302
00:24:41,526 --> 00:24:43,744
That's so heartless of you, Mother.

303
00:24:46,224 --> 00:24:47,528
Prem...

304
00:24:48,537 --> 00:24:50,528
I love you.

305
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,384
Can I ask you something, Mother?

306
00:25:07,846 --> 00:25:09,198
Sure, my dear.

307
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:12,748
Why did you marry Father?

308
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,758
Because we love each other.

309
00:25:18,311 --> 00:25:21,184
Then why can't I marry the person I love?

310
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,209
Prem...

311
00:25:27,351 --> 00:25:29,208
Mother, you've seen...

312
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:33,169
how much pain I'm in...

313
00:25:34,188 --> 00:25:36,435
trying to do
what you and Father expect of me.

314
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,202
Please give me some time.

315
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:52,297
Just a little time to say
goodbye to the person I love.

316
00:25:54,522 --> 00:25:55,177
Prem...

317
00:26:14,413 --> 00:26:17,008
[RAM2 Hospital]

318
00:26:21,722 --> 00:26:22,864
Bow,

319
00:26:23,242 --> 00:26:24,448
what exactly happened?

320
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,217
Prem was crying on the phone,

321
00:26:26,435 --> 00:26:27,969
so Tan went to get her.

322
00:26:28,355 --> 00:26:30,435
Is it about her parents?

323
00:26:30,624 --> 00:26:31,431
Yeah.

324
00:26:31,831 --> 00:26:34,951
Her mother asked her
to end things with Pat as her birthday gift.

325
00:26:40,028 --> 00:26:41,584
How smart of her...

326
00:26:42,282 --> 00:26:44,208
to ask for something like that.

327
00:26:44,355 --> 00:26:45,497
You're right.

328
00:26:46,711 --> 00:26:48,718
If she forced her,
Prem wouldn't have given in.

329
00:26:50,217 --> 00:26:52,711
But she tried to make it look like she cared

330
00:26:53,271 --> 00:26:54,835
and loved Prem

331
00:26:55,737 --> 00:26:58,202
when she just couldn't accept
who her daughter loves.

332
00:27:06,013 --> 00:27:06,798
Prem,

333
00:27:07,882 --> 00:27:09,591
no matter what you decide,

334
00:27:09,868 --> 00:27:12,791
we'll always be by your side.

335
00:27:13,693 --> 00:27:15,322
I know.

336
00:27:17,351 --> 00:27:19,728
But why does it hurt so bad?

337
00:27:24,253 --> 00:27:25,337
Prem...

338
00:27:26,195 --> 00:27:28,013
be kind when you tell Pat, okay?

339
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:30,937
She might be hurting even more than you.

340
00:27:34,711 --> 00:27:37,060
Maybe wait a little longer, Prem?

341
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:40,958
Waiting only makes it worse.

342
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,777
It'll still hurt, now or later.

343
00:28:36,698 --> 00:28:38,835
I wonder if she'd be happy to see this.

344
00:28:41,748 --> 00:28:43,620
You'll be officially mine.

345
00:29:14,863 --> 00:29:15,636
Prem,

346
00:29:15,637 --> 00:29:16,957
what's wrong?

347
00:29:18,448 --> 00:29:19,956
Are you okay?

348
00:29:22,536 --> 00:29:24,259
I'm right here with you.

349
00:29:27,728 --> 00:29:30,245
But I can't be with you.

350
00:29:35,008 --> 00:29:36,594
Why can't we?

351
00:29:38,892 --> 00:29:40,950
We can be together, Prem.

352
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:44,252
I'm sorry.

353
00:29:45,306 --> 00:29:47,190
Is this really the only way?

354
00:29:50,106 --> 00:29:52,710
I'm sorry I couldn't be stronger.

355
00:29:53,328 --> 00:29:54,776
I'm really sorry.

356
00:29:59,663 --> 00:30:01,343
Should we run away...

357
00:30:01,616 --> 00:30:03,285
to somewhere far from here?

358
00:30:06,106 --> 00:30:07,685
I can't do that.

359
00:30:15,466 --> 00:30:17,132
Let's face it together.

360
00:30:17,136 --> 00:30:18,681
Don't give up now.

361
00:30:20,426 --> 00:30:23,270
You're asking me to go against my parents?

362
00:30:30,376 --> 00:30:32,805
I understand you, Prem. I really do.

363
00:30:36,972 --> 00:30:38,906
But isn't there any other way?

364
00:30:43,156 --> 00:30:45,583
Every way only leads to pain.

365
00:30:47,605 --> 00:30:50,034
We can go through the pain together.

366
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,125
I can't let you go through that.

367
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:02,434
I don't want anyone to go through it.

368
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,645
The only way to stop this...

369
00:31:07,648 --> 00:31:10,972
is to let go now before it gets worse.

370
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,259
I'm...

371
00:31:19,088 --> 00:31:20,412
I'm sorry

372
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:23,168
that this is all I can do for you.

373
00:31:36,536 --> 00:31:39,096
You don't have to be sorry, Prem.

374
00:31:41,728 --> 00:31:42,732
I know...

375
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:45,045
you don't want this, either.

376
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,801
But can't we stay together a bit longer?

377
00:31:53,859 --> 00:31:55,939
Just a little longer...

378
00:32:02,306 --> 00:32:04,870
I wish I could,

379
00:32:06,361 --> 00:32:09,692
but I don't want to be selfish
toward you anymore.

380
00:32:10,383 --> 00:32:12,696
You're not selfish at all, Prem.

381
00:32:14,085 --> 00:32:16,492
I'd give up everything...

382
00:32:17,939 --> 00:32:19,612
just to be with you.

383
00:32:22,216 --> 00:32:25,016
All I want is to be with you.

384
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,885
I'll always be in your heart, Pat.

385
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:50,674
And you...

386
00:32:50,812 --> 00:32:53,285
will always be in mine.

387
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:15,256
Why does happiness never last long?

388
00:33:16,623 --> 00:33:18,256
I knew...

389
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,943
this day would come,

390
00:33:23,437 --> 00:33:25,074
but I never thought...

391
00:33:26,157 --> 00:33:28,899
it would come this soon.

392
00:33:30,994 --> 00:33:32,819
Neither did I.

393
00:33:35,212 --> 00:33:38,005
I never wanted to leave you, Pat.

394
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:42,579
I only wanted to be with you forever.

395
00:33:45,176 --> 00:33:47,008
I love you, Pat.

396
00:33:47,932 --> 00:33:49,408
I really do.

397
00:33:51,176 --> 00:33:53,256
I love you, too, Prem.

398
00:33:57,445 --> 00:33:59,983
I'll try my best to be strong

399
00:34:00,725 --> 00:34:03,285
and do what you asked for.

400
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,521
The only way...

401
00:34:11,736 --> 00:34:13,430
for us not to be together...

402
00:34:15,946 --> 00:34:17,156
is for me...

403
00:34:17,736 --> 00:34:20,448
to run away, far from here.

404
00:34:56,703 --> 00:34:58,686
I'm sorry, Pat.

405
00:34:59,445 --> 00:35:00,732
I'm really sorry.

406
00:35:04,696 --> 00:35:05,925
That's enough.

407
00:35:09,052 --> 00:35:10,143
I actually...

408
00:35:10,339 --> 00:35:12,797
brought you a gift...

409
00:35:15,299 --> 00:35:17,270
but I guess it's useless now.

410
00:35:18,266 --> 00:35:19,503
What is it?

411
00:35:20,281 --> 00:35:22,506
What's your gift for me?

412
00:35:37,925 --> 00:35:39,277
A ring...

413
00:35:41,488 --> 00:35:43,263
Put it on me.

414
00:35:49,386 --> 00:35:50,143
But...

415
00:35:52,063 --> 00:35:53,596
My heart...

416
00:35:54,556 --> 00:35:56,812
will only be yours, Pat.

417
00:36:02,046 --> 00:36:03,546
Put it on me.

418
00:36:43,161 --> 00:36:44,768
Thank you...

419
00:36:45,423 --> 00:36:47,766
for wanting to wear it anyway.

420
00:36:50,136 --> 00:36:52,550
I have something for you, too.

421
00:37:02,652 --> 00:37:04,034
This necklace...

422
00:37:05,248 --> 00:37:06,717
means a lot to me

423
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:11,685
'cause I bought it with my first salary.

424
00:37:28,259 --> 00:37:29,968
It's yours now.

425
00:37:31,226 --> 00:37:32,761
I love you.

426
00:37:36,076 --> 00:37:37,430
So deeply.

427
00:37:38,606 --> 00:37:40,172
Stay strong,

428
00:37:41,001 --> 00:37:42,259
my love.

429
00:37:48,376 --> 00:37:49,437
Okay.

430
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:53,045
I'll believe you.

431
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,466
I'll stay strong...

432
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,121
and keep waiting...

433
00:38:05,852 --> 00:38:08,274
until the day we can be together again.

434
00:38:13,466 --> 00:38:14,717
Tonight,

435
00:38:15,619 --> 00:38:18,012
let's say, "I love you," one last time.

436
00:38:20,528 --> 00:38:21,779
Tonight,

437
00:38:23,556 --> 00:38:25,248
let's hold on to our love

438
00:38:27,343 --> 00:38:29,248
and be together, okay?

439
00:38:35,626 --> 00:38:37,066
And just for tonight,

440
00:38:37,796 --> 00:38:40,259
please be mine, Prem.

441
00:38:50,383 --> 00:38:51,728
I love you,

442
00:38:52,921 --> 00:38:54,936
Dr. Premsinee,

I love you, too,

520
00:48:28,582 --> 00:48:29,949
This...

521
00:48:30,714 --> 00:48:32,989
can wait until tomorrow, can't it?

522
00:48:36,138 --> 00:48:37,544
You should take care of yourself.

523
00:48:41,767 --> 00:48:43,864
I look terrible, don't I?

524
00:48:44,894 --> 00:48:45,716
Yeah.

525
00:48:49,476 --> 00:48:51,731
Actually, I ran into Pat yesterday.

526
00:48:52,124 --> 00:48:53,984
She told me
she's leaving for the U.S. tomorrow.

527
00:49:01,585 --> 00:49:03,142
How is she doing?

528
00:49:09,127 --> 00:49:10,545
Just as messed up as you.

529
00:49:13,394 --> 00:49:14,480
She isn't doing great.

530
00:49:19,345 --> 00:49:21,476
I gotta go now.

531
00:49:23,784 --> 00:49:25,462

533
00:49:29,069 --> 00:49:30,938
I'll have to see my family tomorrow.

534
00:49:32,393 --> 00:49:34,674
Come on, won't you at least see her off?

535
00:49:41,651 --> 00:49:43,382

00:49:45,404 --> 00:49:47,084

537
00:49:48,794 --> 00:49:51,425
I'll only want to make her stay...

538
00:49:54,313 --> 00:49:56,262
and then I'll break my promise.

539
00:50:03,024 --> 00:50:06,264
Are you sure
you want to drive to the airport yourself?

540
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:09,469
I am.

541
00:50:10,094 --> 00:50:12,224
I'll have someone drive it back.

542
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,727
Don't worry about me, okay?

543
00:50:17,054 --> 00:50:19,331

546
00:50:24,644 --> 00:50:26,909
until you get used to life there.

547
00:50:28,604 --> 00:50:30,244
I'll be okay.

549
00:50:32,294 --> 00:50:34,305

00:50:34,662 --> 00:50:35,564
Okay.

551
00:50:37,724 --> 00:50:39,144
I love you, Papa, Mama.

552
00:51:02,034 --> 00:51:03,418
I'm leaving now.

553
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,344
Honey,

554
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,144
I can't explain it, but I feel uneasy.

555
00:51:26,407 --> 00:51:28,967
