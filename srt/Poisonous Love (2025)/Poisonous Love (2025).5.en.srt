1
00:02:23,614 --> 00:02:24,814
I slept with a woman...

2
00:02:25,134 --> 00:02:26,334
This is insane.

3
00:02:26,694 --> 00:02:28,854
How could I let that happen?

4
00:03:07,174 --> 00:03:08,974
Did she get so shy that she had to leave?

5
00:03:13,054 --> 00:03:15,214
[RAM2 Hospital]

6
00:03:26,214 --> 00:03:27,974
What an early visit.

7
00:03:29,194 --> 00:03:30,334
Don't act so nonchalant.

8
00:03:31,654 --> 00:03:32,814
I have a ward round today.

9
00:03:33,574 --> 00:03:35,454
A 7:30 one?

10
00:03:35,614 --> 00:03:36,334
Huh?

11
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:37,934
I feel like doing an early one.

12
00:03:40,294 --> 00:03:42,854
I doubt your patients
are early birds, Dr. Premsinee.

13
00:03:50,174 --> 00:03:51,414
Prem, what happened there?

14
00:03:52,334 --> 00:03:54,054
Yeah, you're right.

15
00:03:54,454 --> 00:03:56,541
Huh? What happened?

16
00:03:57,174 --> 00:03:58,054
Where?

17
00:03:58,294 --> 00:03:59,294
On your neck.

18
00:04:08,614 --> 00:04:09,614
It's just a rash.

19
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,638
I don't think it's a rash, though.

20
00:04:16,654 --> 00:04:18,774
Rash would have looked different,

21
00:04:19,014 --> 00:04:21,494
but this looks like a contusion.

22
00:04:26,014 --> 00:04:28,067
Wait, is this...

23
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:29,774
What is it?

24
00:04:30,374 --> 00:04:31,614
It's a hickey!

25
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,094
Prem, tell us who gave you that hickey!

26
00:04:35,134 --> 00:04:36,614
Yeah, who?

27
00:04:36,654 --> 00:04:38,134
Uh... it's...

28
00:04:38,174 --> 00:04:39,254
It's...

29
00:04:39,294 --> 00:04:41,254
What's with the stuttering?
Just spit it out!

30
00:04:42,454 --> 00:04:43,614
Say it!

31
00:04:45,194 --> 00:04:46,374
I was just having fun.

32
00:04:49,534 --> 00:04:51,094
What did I just say?

33
00:04:53,814 --> 00:04:55,774
Don't say that, Dr. Premsinee.

34
00:04:55,814 --> 00:04:57,334
You're not the type to act on impulse!

35
00:04:57,934 --> 00:04:59,454
- I...
- Was it a mistake?

36
00:04:59,974 --> 00:05:01,774
Have you taken morning-after pills?

37
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:04,368
Don't go silent now!

38
00:05:04,534 --> 00:05:05,534
Have you?

39
00:05:07,494 --> 00:05:08,494
I haven't.

40
00:05:10,434 --> 00:05:11,934
It's almost time for the ward round.

41
00:05:12,054 --> 00:05:13,534
Let's just go and do our job.

42
00:05:14,294 --> 00:05:16,414
We can talk later.

43
00:05:21,634 --> 00:05:22,634
Tan,

44
00:05:22,674 --> 00:05:24,214
please tell me that was just one bad joke.

45
00:05:24,494 --> 00:05:25,334
Bow,

46
00:05:25,894 --> 00:05:27,414
she probably thought it out.

47
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,094
She'll probably tell us when she's ready.

48
00:05:31,694 --> 00:05:34,054
I don't think I can just let this go.

49
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:35,934
We've gotta help her.

50
00:05:43,014 --> 00:05:44,974
What are you two even thinking about doing?

51
00:05:45,014 --> 00:05:46,294
Tan, is anyone around?

52
00:05:47,854 --> 00:05:48,854
Nada.

53
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:49,894
The coast is clear.

54
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:51,454
Alright, then, go be on the lookout.

55
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,094
What's the matter with you?

56
00:05:59,494 --> 00:06:00,494
Here are morning-after pills.

57
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,014
Tan and I bought them for you.

58
00:06:04,174 --> 00:06:05,774
- I...
- Don't say no.

59
00:06:05,814 --> 00:06:06,854
I understand everything.

60
00:06:06,894 --> 00:06:08,614
But just hurry and take one now,

61
00:06:08,654 --> 00:06:09,774
or there'll be a bun in your oven!

62
00:06:10,854 --> 00:06:12,494
- But...
- Here, take them!

63
00:06:14,894 --> 00:06:15,654
Prem,

64
00:06:15,694 --> 00:06:17,694
I'm dying to know who that man was.

65
00:06:20,574 --> 00:06:22,654
Yeah, who?

66
00:06:27,414 --> 00:06:28,894
- What?
- Prem!

67
00:06:28,934 --> 00:06:30,054
Don't forget your pills!

68
00:06:33,614 --> 00:06:35,134
Who even is that man,

69
00:06:35,654 --> 00:06:37,334
and why is she hiding it from us?

70
00:06:37,574 --> 00:06:39,694
Yeah, that's odd.

71
00:06:56,254 --> 00:06:57,254
Come in.

72
00:07:31,734 --> 00:07:32,854
Doc?

73
00:07:36,494 --> 00:07:37,174
Uh...

74
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:41,014
Here are the patient files for today.

75
00:07:42,014 --> 00:07:42,894
Right.

76
00:07:43,374 --> 00:07:45,934
Are you okay, Doctor?

77
00:07:46,054 --> 00:07:47,174
I...

78
00:07:47,814 --> 00:07:49,454
I need to take a quick break.

79
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:41,614
Am I going nuts?

80
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:50,614
Hello.

81
00:08:51,414 --> 00:08:52,694
Am I seeing things again?

82
00:08:55,454 --> 00:08:56,374
Oh, Miss Pat!

83
00:08:56,414 --> 00:08:58,774
Does your mother
have an appointment with Dr. Prem today?

84
00:08:59,554 --> 00:09:00,654
That's in the flesh!

85
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,534
No, she doesn't.

86
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,414
I'm here to see Dr. Premsinee.

87
00:09:06,454 --> 00:09:07,774
Is she here today?

88
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,334
She is,

89
00:09:09,374 --> 00:09:10,854
but she's on a break.

90
00:09:11,014 --> 00:09:12,294
Please sit tight, Miss Pat.

91
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:13,774
She'll be back soon.

92
00:09:14,394 --> 00:09:15,144
Sure.

93
00:09:34,134 --> 00:09:35,614
- Doctor...
- Don't say a word.

94
00:09:36,154 --> 00:09:37,534
Just listen to what I say.

95
00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:39,414
Tell that woman

96
00:09:39,814 --> 00:09:41,174
I already left.

97
00:09:44,134 --> 00:09:45,134
Understood?

98
00:09:46,134 --> 00:09:47,294
Why don't you say something?!

99
00:09:47,334 --> 00:09:49,534
You told me to just listen!

100
00:09:52,214 --> 00:09:53,374
So you got it?

101
00:09:53,534 --> 00:09:55,014
Yes, I got it!

102
00:09:57,934 --> 00:09:59,134
What was that?

103
00:10:05,494 --> 00:10:07,574
Uh... Miss Pat?

104
00:10:07,614 --> 00:10:12,254
It turns out Dr. Prem said
she had something coming up

105
00:10:12,294 --> 00:10:13,934
and wouldn't make it back in time.

106
00:10:14,174 --> 00:10:14,894
Right.

107
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:50,694
Last night, you and Dr. Premsinee...

108
00:10:51,094 --> 00:10:52,454
slept together?

109
00:10:54,574 --> 00:10:55,694
Good job, girl,

110
00:10:55,854 --> 00:10:59,694
for cracking such a tough nut like her!

111
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:01,934
You crushed it, sis!

112
00:11:02,354 --> 00:11:03,354
For sure.

113
00:11:03,694 --> 00:11:06,054
I think she gets so shy
that she can't look me in the eye.

114
00:11:06,514 --> 00:11:07,934
I have no idea where she went.

115
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,534
What do you mean?

116
00:11:09,934 --> 00:11:12,614
Well, this morning when I woke up,

117
00:11:13,054 --> 00:11:14,574
she wasn't there anymore,

118
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,334
and she was nowhere to be found
at the hospital.

119
00:11:17,994 --> 00:11:18,934
Wait,

120
00:11:19,354 --> 00:11:20,354
isn't that weird?

121
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:22,214
Weird how?

122
00:11:22,774 --> 00:11:25,214
It's like she's purposely avoiding you!

123
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:26,534
Avoiding me?

124
00:11:26,774 --> 00:11:27,654
Why?

125
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,334
We had an amazing time last night!

126
00:11:30,574 --> 00:11:31,694
How could you be sure?

127
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:33,934
Did you do something bizarre last night?

128
00:11:36,194 --> 00:11:37,996
People who feel something for each other

129
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:39,934
don't just disappear like this.

130
00:12:35,014 --> 00:12:36,254
Why didn't it open?

131
00:12:36,614 --> 00:12:37,734
The password isn't wrong...

132
00:12:41,774 --> 00:12:42,814
Prem!

133
00:12:43,014 --> 00:12:44,014
Prem!

134
00:12:44,294 --> 00:12:45,774
Are you alright?

135
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:46,779
Prem...

136
00:12:47,014 --> 00:12:48,014
Prem!

137
00:12:48,694 --> 00:12:50,294
Prem, would you open the door for me?

138
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:51,654
Prem, what's wrong?

139
00:12:55,854 --> 00:12:56,814
Prem!

140
00:12:57,294 --> 00:12:58,334
I'm begging you,

141
00:12:58,374 --> 00:12:59,854
please open the door!

142
00:13:00,194 --> 00:13:01,134
Prem!

143
00:13:01,694 --> 00:13:02,614
Prem!

144
00:13:03,474 --> 00:13:04,474
Prem!

145
00:13:04,854 --> 00:13:06,174
Prem, what's happening?!

146
00:13:06,534 --> 00:13:08,454
Prem, open the door for me...

147
00:13:08,894 --> 00:13:09,894
Prem!

148
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:11,814
Prem!

149
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:13,774
Prem, what's wrong?

150
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:14,894
Prem!

151
00:13:16,594 --> 00:13:18,574
Prem, please open the door.

152
00:13:18,614 --> 00:13:19,534
Prem...

153
00:13:19,734 --> 00:13:20,734
Prem...

154
00:13:21,214 --> 00:13:22,494
Please, I'm begging you...

155
00:13:22,534 --> 00:13:24,054
Open the door for me.

156
00:13:25,094 --> 00:13:26,214
Prem!

157
00:13:26,534 --> 00:13:27,454
Prem!

158
00:13:47,054 --> 00:13:48,294
You scared me.

159
00:13:48,454 --> 00:13:50,054
Are you alright, Prem?

160
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:51,614
Are you hurt?

161
00:13:59,614 --> 00:14:00,774
That's enough.

162
00:14:01,694 --> 00:14:02,894
Don't come see me ever again.

163
00:14:07,794 --> 00:14:08,934
I don't understand.

164
00:14:09,854 --> 00:14:11,414
Why would you say that, Prem?

165
00:14:12,614 --> 00:14:14,494
And why can't I say that?

166
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,294
Prem, what's wrong?

167
00:14:17,694 --> 00:14:20,094
Did I do something
you didn't like last night?

168
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,334
Let me make it up to you.

169
00:14:22,374 --> 00:14:23,894
What did I do wrong?

170
00:14:24,914 --> 00:14:26,614
It has nothing to do with that.

171
00:14:27,474 --> 00:14:29,074
So what's the matter?

172
00:14:32,774 --> 00:14:34,174
Please say something.

173
00:14:34,594 --> 00:14:35,694
If you don't tell me,

174
00:14:35,734 --> 00:14:37,934
then how am I supposed to know
what my mistake was?

175
00:14:39,454 --> 00:14:40,454
It wasn't you.

176
00:14:41,774 --> 00:14:43,294
The one who made a mistake

177
00:14:43,334 --> 00:14:44,454
was me.

178
00:14:45,854 --> 00:14:47,574
I was the one who lost my senses.

179
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:49,974
I don't understand.

180
00:14:50,694 --> 00:14:52,614
What happened last night

181
00:14:54,414 --> 00:14:57,054
was the biggest lapse
of judgment in my life.

182
00:14:58,814 --> 00:14:59,694
That's not true...

183
00:14:59,734 --> 00:15:01,374
It was just an impulse.

184
00:15:02,414 --> 00:15:03,414
You're lying!

185
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,614
I know you were fond of it.

186
00:15:07,814 --> 00:15:08,974
Just stop talking!

187
00:15:09,014 --> 00:15:10,014
I won't.

188
00:15:12,354 --> 00:15:14,214
I know we felt the same last night.

189
00:15:15,254 --> 00:15:16,774
I didn't feel anything,

190
00:15:17,894 --> 00:15:20,134
and I didn't feel

323
00:24:08,027 --> 00:24:11,115
Maybe even twice or three times a day.

324
00:24:11,155 --> 00:24:13,875
I think that person
is definitely hitting on her!

00:24:29,195 --> 00:24:30,595

328
00:24:34,255 --> 00:24:35,755
I'm worried about Prem, of course.

329
00:24:36,135 --> 00:24:38,035
That someone is hitting on her?

330
00:24:38,675 --> 00:24:41,355
Didn't you say you were afraid
she was gonna stay single?

331
00:24:47,515 --> 00:24:49,275

333
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:51,715
She did.

334
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:54,595
So I've been thinking
that the man who's asking her out

335
00:24:54,715 --> 00:24:57,435
is the same one she slept with.

336
00:24:58,595 --> 00:24:59,755
Isn't this a good thing?

337
00:25:00,435 --> 00:25:03,835
It means he's genuine and serious about her,

338
00:25:04,435 --> 00:25:05,835
so why are you so troubled?

339
00:25:06,855 --> 00:25:08,955
Prem has just gone through
something really bad,

340
00:25:09,515 --> 00:25:12,395
so I'm worried about what to do

341
00:25:12,435 --> 00:25:13,435
if she's with another jerk.

342
00:25:14,655 --> 00:25:16,835
I think the one you should be worried about

343
00:25:17,615 --> 00:25:19,115
is actually yourself.

344
00:25:22,195 --> 00:25:23,875
Well, she's my friend.

345
00:25:26,555 --> 00:25:29,275
You've been sending flowers
and everything to Dr. Prem daily?

346
00:25:29,515 --> 00:25:30,235
Mm.

347
00:25:31,515 --> 00:25:32,860
For how long?

348
00:25:33,595 --> 00:25:34,507
A week.

349
00:25:35,115 --> 00:25:38,115
And how has she reacted?

350
00:25:38,695 --> 00:25:39,455
Nothing.

351
00:25:39,495 --> 00:25:40,355
Hey!

352
00:25:41,675 --> 00:25:44,195
Do you really think this is gonna work?

353
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:46,615
Can you think of anything better to do?

354
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:47,635
Yeah,

355
00:25:47,795 --> 00:25:50,075
you have to stop sending her stuff

356
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,715
completely!

357
00:25:51,835 --> 00:25:52,835
How could I do that?

358
00:25:52,995 --> 00:25:55,595
She's gonna think
I don't go all out for her.

359
00:25:57,035 --> 00:25:57,715
Pat,

360
00:25:58,155 --> 00:26:01,875
a will doesn't always lead to a way;

361
00:26:02,195 --> 00:26:04,395
it can lead to annoyance.

362
00:26:05,275 --> 00:26:06,555
And I think

363
00:26:06,595 --> 00:26:09,115
she's annoyed with you to the core.

364
00:26:09,595 --> 00:26:11,315
That's why she hasn't given you
any reaction.

365
00:26:14,075 --> 00:26:14,835
Really?

366
00:26:15,095 --> 00:26:15,875
Yeah!

367
00:26:15,915 --> 00:26:17,755
You're good at acting.

368
00:26:18,155 --> 00:26:19,715
Other than that, you're a wimp.

369
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:21,315
Rubbing it in much?

370
00:26:22,755 --> 00:26:24,635
Just listen to me.

371
00:26:24,675 --> 00:26:27,955
This way, you can also prove
how Dr. Prem really feels about you.

372
00:26:29,134 --> 00:26:30,995
If you do as I say

373
00:26:31,035 --> 00:26:33,995
and she's still the same,

374
00:26:34,395 --> 00:26:36,435
I suggest you move on while you can.

375
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:38,395
No good in persevering.

376
00:26:38,835 --> 00:26:41,195
Otherwise, the one
who will be hurt the most is you.

377
00:26:47,395 --> 00:26:50,795
[RAM2 Hospital]

378
00:27:01,195 --> 00:27:02,395
Doc,

379
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:04,155
you got into a fight?

380
00:27:04,655 --> 00:27:05,755
With who?

381
00:27:06,595 --> 00:27:09,235
Well... with the one trying to hit on you.

382
00:27:09,635 --> 00:27:13,437
There are usually desserts
or flowers delivered to you every day,

383
00:27:13,555 --> 00:27:15,835
but it's been days

384
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:18,035
with nothing, Doc.

385
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:20,315
Is something happening to them?

386
00:27:20,475 --> 00:27:22,755
Should you try giving them a call?

387
00:27:23,715 --> 00:27:25,075
Why would I do that?

388
00:27:25,595 --> 00:27:27,475
We're not together or anything.

389
00:27:27,755 --> 00:27:30,755
But they used to send you gifts
every day, Doc.

390
00:27:30,975 --> 00:27:34,235
It seems strange when they just stopped.

391
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:38,875
Maybe they're sick...

392
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,115
or there has been an accident!

393
00:30:28,395 --> 00:30:30,075
Thank you, Sita.

394
00:30:30,755 --> 00:30:31,675
It's no big deal.

395
00:30:40,555 --> 00:30:41,315
Prem,

396
00:30:43,215 --> 00:30:45,275
if there's something bothering you,

397
00:30:45,675 --> 00:30:47,075
you can talk to me.

398
00:30:48,155 --> 00:30:49,275
I'm willing to listen.

399
00:30:52,015 --> 00:30:52,595
Of course.

400
00:30:59,935 --> 00:31:00,935
Sita.

401
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:07,475
You didn't sleep with a man,

402
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:09,635
but a woman?

403
00:31:11,275 --> 00:31:11,915
Yes.

404
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,115
I guess Bow and Tan could be at ease now.

405
00:31:16,915 --> 00:31:18,355
No, Sita.

406
00:31:18,635 --> 00:31:20,435
They can't know about this.

407
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:21,755
Why not?

408
00:31:22,475 --> 00:31:25,835
Is it that you are reluctant
about the relationship,

409
00:31:28,475 --> 00:31:31,795
or are you appalled
by the thought of being with a woman?

410
00:31:33,995 --> 00:31:35,515
It's not like that, Sita.

411
00:31:36,515 --> 00:31:38,035
I'm neither reluctant

412
00:31:38,535 --> 00:31:40,395
nor appalled.

413
00:31:41,315 --> 00:31:42,315
It's just...

414
00:31:42,675 --> 00:31:44,515
she is like...

415
00:31:44,555 --> 00:31:46,475
a chaos in my life,

416
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:48,955
but, all of a sudden,
I feel something for her.

417
00:31:49,555 --> 00:31:51,275
Can I ask who she is?

418
00:31:52,975 --> 00:31:54,715
She was the person who ruined my wedding.

419
00:31:59,395 --> 00:32:00,555
I feel that

420
00:32:01,915 --> 00:32:03,355
after the wedding was crashed,

421
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:05,315
my life has been a mess.

422
00:32:06,755 --> 00:32:09,435
Nothing goes as I planned anymore.

423
00:32:10,855 --> 00:32:12,315
That's just the way life is.

424
00:32:12,915 --> 00:32:14,715
Things don't always happen in order

425
00:32:14,755 --> 00:32:16,795
or go according to plan.

426
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:19,515
But it's driving me nuts, Sita.

427
00:32:20,255 --> 00:32:22,035
I was the one pushing her away,

428
00:32:22,935 --> 00:32:23,875
but now I...

429
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,053
Miss her?

430
00:32:25,955 --> 00:32:27,795
What is it that you're worried about?

431
00:32:28,995 --> 00:32:30,395
I'm worried that

432
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:32,875
if I let her be in my life...

433
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,535
Will everything fall apart
like last time, Sita?

434
00:32:39,235 --> 00:32:41,635
I'm wondering if this is what I really want?

435
00:32:43,475 --> 00:32:45,795
Are you happy being with her?

436
00:32:46,775 --> 00:32:48,835
If you can answer yourself

437
00:32:49,155 --> 00:32:51,995
whether or not you're happy being with her,

438
00:32:53,035 --> 00:32:54,795
I think that's enough.

439
00:32:55,535 --> 00:32:56,755
Is that so, Sita?

440
00:32:59,955 --> 00:33:00,715
Prem,

441
00:33:01,495 --> 00:33:04,555
as a doctor, we face
matters of life and death every day.

442
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:06,435
I've seen it all,

443
00:33:06,475 --> 00:33:09,395
how people regret things in their lives

444
00:33:10,015 --> 00:33:12,275
on their last day.

445
00:33:12,855 --> 00:33:16,395
We don't know if something good

446
00:33:16,915 --> 00:33:18,555
or bad awaits

447
00:33:18,895 --> 00:33:21,635
until you open your heart.

448
00:33:25,195 --> 00:33:27,220
Please don't run away
from your feelings, Prem.

449
00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:58,056
Pat, you've gotta double down.

450
00:33:58,256 --> 00:34:00,056
Don't show your face to her at all!

451
00:34:00,223 --> 00:34:01,296
Ticha,

452
00:34:01,536 --> 00:34:03,296
I can't take it anymore.

453
00:34:03,336 --> 00:34:04,536
I miss her.

454
00:34:25,336 --> 00:34:28,016
Didn't you tell me
to hold the hands that want to hold mine?

455
00:34:49,976 --> 00:34:51,896
Didn't you say you wouldn't go anywhere?

456
00:34:52,896 --> 00:34:54,336
You miss me?

457
00:34:58,896 --> 00:34:59,776
Yes,

458
00:35:00,656 --> 00:35:01,656
I miss you.

459
00:35:03,036 --> 00:35:04,236
A lot, actually.

460
00:35:36,956 --> 00:35:38,936
I've never thought

461
00:35:38,976 --> 00:35:41,096
I could miss anyone this tremendously.

462
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,176
You started this, Prem.

463
00:35:44,336 --> 00:35:54,056
♫No words needed to realize you're the one♫

464
00:35:54,096 --> 00:36:04,056
♫I was born to be the moon to your sun♫

495

Please don't run away from me again.

496
00:39:54,816 --> 00:39:56,456
Since when did you wake up?

497
00:39:57,416 --> 00:39:58,816
A while,

498
00:39:59,636 --> 00:40:01,056
but I don't want to get up.

499
00:40:02,536 --> 00:40:04,416
I'm afraid you'll disappear again.

500
00:40:13,016 --> 00:40:14,456
I'm not going anywhere.

501
00:40:14,896 --> 00:40:15,896
Really?

502
00:40:18,656 --> 00:40:19,696
I promise.

503
00:40:24,936 --> 00:40:25,885
Promise.

504
00:40:28,456 --> 00:40:30,016
You're the cutest.

505
00:40:36,956 --> 00:40:38,496
Prem.

506
00:40:39,056 --> 00:40:39,856
Hm?

507
00:40:40,936 --> 00:40:42,976
I don't wanna get up.

508
00:40:43,456 --> 00:40:46,016
I wanna stay in bed like this all day.

509
00:40:46,856 --> 00:40:49,616
Well, you're in luck

510
00:40:50,236 --> 00:40:52,216
because I don't have any patients today.

511
00:40:52,656 --> 00:40:53,575
Yes!

512
00:40:53,896 --> 00:40:55,716
You really don't?

513
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:00,816
That thrilled, huh?

514
00:41:03,696 --> 00:41:06,256
But you've gotta go take a bath.

515
00:41:06,536 --> 00:41:08,336
You're accumulating germs!

516
00:41:08,736 --> 00:41:11,056
Are you calling me a germ?

517
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:14,776
You decide.

518
00:41:16,176 --> 00:41:17,816
A grown adult

519
00:41:17,856 --> 00:41:19,456
will figure it out.

520
00:41:21,816 --> 00:41:23,376
But a germ like me

521
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:27,216
is not easily detected.

522
00:41:28,496 --> 00:41:30,696
I'm fully equipped

523
00:41:38,216 --> 00:41:39,336
with beauty,

524
00:41:48,016 --> 00:41:49,016
sexiness,

525
00:41:58,356 --> 00:41:59,841
and hotness.

526
00:42:02,376 --> 00:42:04,176
Go take a bath!

527
00:42:06,916 --> 00:42:08,256
Fine...

528
00:42:10,296 --> 00:42:12,296
Miss Spotless.

529
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:14,281
Go.

530
00:42:15,056 --> 00:42:16,456
Come take a bath with me, then.

531
00:42:19,896 --> 00:42:21,976
Why would you be shy

532
00:42:22,376 --> 00:42:23,936
when I've seen everything?!

533
00:42:24,656 --> 00:42:25,918
No comments.

534
00:42:30,096 --> 00:42:31,536
Prem!

535
00:42:32,576 --> 00:42:33,549
Yes?

536
00:42:34,856 --> 00:42:37,016
Please take a bath with me...

537
00:42:37,536 --> 00:42:38,496
No.

538
00:42:39,576 --> 00:42:40,456
Yes.

539
00:42:42,096 --> 00:42:43,496
Doc!

540
00:42:43,536 --> 00:42:44,656
Yes?

541
00:42:46,736 --> 00:42:49,496
You need to own up to what you did.

542
00:42:54,256 --> 00:42:55,256
Alright.

543
00:43:04,016 --> 00:43:05,136
Are you gonna keep staring?

544
00:43:06,136 --> 00:43:08,096
Well, I can't help that you're so pretty.

545
00:43:09,616 --> 00:43:11,976
I'll never get tired of the sight of you.

546
00:43:21,616 --> 00:43:22,776
Prem...

547
00:43:23,416 --> 00:43:24,070
Huh?

548
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,416
I'm so happy

549
00:43:27,976 --> 00:43:30,136
that you don't shut me out again.

550
00:43:36,256 --> 00:43:37,576
I'm sorry.

551
00:43:38,416 --> 00:43:39,616
It's just...

552
00:43:41,556 --> 00:43:43,056
I was confused

553
00:43:43,636 --> 00:43:45,656
about what to do next.

554
00:43:48,036 --> 00:43:49,336
But...

555
00:43:49,816 --> 00:43:51,136
you figure it out now, don't you?

556
00:44:11,656 --> 00:44:13,256
I love you, Prem.

557
00:44:21,096 --> 00:44:22,416
Prem.

558
00:44:23,696 --> 00:44:24,490
Hm?

559
00:44:24,976 --> 00:44:27,216
I have another favor to ask.

560
00:44:27,776 --> 00:44:29,016
What favor?

561
00:44:29,856 --> 00:44:33,336
Can you call me 'Pat,'

562
00:44:34,576 --> 00:44:36,456
not 'Miss Pat'?

563
00:44:37,136 --> 00:44:38,979
When you say that,

564
00:44:41,016 --> 00:44:43,216
we feel so distant from each other.

565
00:44:47,416 --> 00:44:48,336
Pat...

566
00:44:49,109 --> 00:44:50,322
Do you like it

567
00:44:50,856 --> 00:44:52,176
when I call you this, Pat?

568
00:44:54,135 --> 00:44:55,135
What?

569
00:44:55,816 --> 00:44:57,776
It sounds so cute!

570
00:44:57,976 --> 00:44:58,976
Do you like it?

571
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:00,056
Yeah,

572
00:45:00,756 --> 00:45:02,856
I like it very much!

573
00:45:03,176 --> 00:45:04,366
Can you say that again?

574
00:45:04,696 --> 00:45:06,256
Of course.

575
00:45:07,256 --> 00:45:10,216
I... will do what you please, Pat.

576
00:45:19,916 --> 00:45:21,296
Let's say that

577
00:45:22,336 --> 00:45:24,296
we're girlfriends now.

578
00:45:24,656 --> 00:45:27,416
You're all mine,

579
00:45:27,896 --> 00:45:31,016
and I'm all yours.

580
00:45:33,496 --> 00:45:36,256
You can't look at anyone ever again.

581
00:45:38,056 --> 00:45:40,296
Neither can you, Pat.

582
00:45:42,336 --> 00:45:43,336
Of course.

583
00:45:43,936 --> 00:45:45,336
- Promise?
- Mm,

584
00:45:49,016 --> 00:45:50,176
I promise.

585
00:46:03,656 --> 00:46:06,096
So this is love.

586
00:46:07,336 --> 00:46:08,336
How sweet.

587
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:42,677
[Agreement on Parental Responsibility]

588
00:46:44,157 --> 00:46:45,437
What is this, Thawat?

589
00:46:45,957 --> 00:46:46,957
An agreement

590
00:46:47,717 --> 00:46:50,677
saying I'll support the child financially
until they're of legal age,

591
00:46:52,437 --> 00:46:53,917
as long as you stay away from me.

592
00:46:59,477 --> 00:47:01,477
What I want is not financial support;

593
00:47:01,517 --> 00:47:03,357
it's you, Thawat!

594
00:47:03,797 --> 00:47:06,114
Are you thick in the head?!

595
00:47:06,154 --> 00:47:07,967
With you, it's just for fun!

596
00:47:08,637 --> 00:47:10,637
I was never serious!

597
00:47:12,477 --> 00:47:15,637
Stop building castles in the air
about us getting married.

598
00:47:16,237 --> 00:47:17,285
Why?

599
00:47:18,397 --> 00:47:20,717
How am I less of a person
than Dr. Premsinee?

600
00:47:20,957 --> 00:47:22,557
You still have the nerve to ask?

601
00:47:24,517 --> 00:47:25,517
What do you have?

602
00:47:26,757 --> 00:47:27,757
A family name?

603
00:47:30,957 --> 00:47:31,957
Wealth?

604
00:47:34,717 --> 00:47:36,037
Social status?

605
00:47:36,677 --> 00:47:37,797
None,

606
00:47:38,557 --> 00:47:42,117
while Prem has everything I need.

607
00:47:44,397 --> 00:47:47,997
The only way for you to be worthy of me

608
00:47:48,797 --> 00:47:50,837
is to die and pray for the next life.

609
00:47:54,597 --> 00:47:57,037
I'll have a new copy sent to you;

610
00:47:57,077 --> 00:47:58,597
if you still can't come to your senses,

611
00:47:59,237 --> 00:48:00,757
just raise that child by yourself.

612
00:48:54,877 --> 00:48:55,637
Pat!

613
00:48:55,917 --> 00:48:57,597
Open the door for me.

614
00:48:57,637 --> 00:48:58,397
Pat!

615
00:48:58,757 --> 00:49:00,717
Pat, what took you...

616
00:49:01,637 --> 00:49:02,637
Who are you looking for?

617
00:49:04,317 --> 00:49:05,557
Isn't this Pat's place?

618
00:49:05,597 --> 00:49:06,917
No. Pat who?

619
00:49:07,317 --> 00:49:08,717
This is Pat's place!

620
00:49:08,757 --> 00:49:10,397
I'm always here, so I would know!

621
00:49:11,957 --> 00:49:13,357
I don't know any Pats,

622
00:49:13,997 --> 00:49:16,837
and I'm now the new owner of this place,

623
00:49:16,877 --> 00:49:17,877
okay?

624
00:49:22,117 --> 00:49:23,397
"The new owner of this place"?

625
00:49:24,417 --> 00:49:25,677
Where's Pat, then?

626
00:49:34,477 --> 00:49:36,117
I ordered this for you:

627
00:49:36,497 --> 00:49:37,837
some clean food,

628
00:49:37,877 --> 00:49:40,477
perfect for someone as healthy as you.

629
00:49:42,737 --> 00:49:44,677
You know me so well!

630
00:49:45,757 --> 00:49:47,597
Well, I really do.

631
00:50:03,237 --> 00:50:04,637
Is it bad?

632
00:50:06,517 --> 00:50:08,797
But the last time I ordered this,

633
00:50:09,477 --> 00:50:11,397
it was yummy...

634
00:50:25,617 --> 00:50:28,917
I think this is
much more pleasant to taste.

635
00:50:31,917 --> 00:50:33,957
You're quite a naughty one, aren't you?

636
00:50:46,177 --> 00:50:47,757
Prem.

637
00:50:48,237 --> 00:50:49,277
Yes?

638
00:50:50,397 --> 00:50:52,797
I want this love

639
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:55,717
to be serious

640
00:50:56,517 --> 00:50:57,757
and healthy.

641
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,797
It will forever bond us with one another.

642
00:51:02,477 --> 00:51:04,157
We will not get separated.

643
00:51:06,477 --> 00:51:07,357
Right.

644
00:51:07,897 --> 00:51:09,477
We will not get separated.

645
00:51:24,637 --> 00:51:25,917
Who's calling?

646
00:51:26,477 --> 00:51:29,797
[Nam]

647
00:51:39,917 --> 00:51:40,917
You're not gonna take it?

648
00:51:42,077 --> 00:51:42,997
No,

649
00:51:44,917 --> 00:51:47,197
I don't want anything ruining our time.

650
00:51:50,717 --> 00:51:51,639
Alright.

651
00:52:05,477 --> 00:52:06,957
[Nam]

652
00:52:10,037 --> 00:52:11,037
Hello.

653
00:52:11,437 --> 00:52:12,557
Ticha,

654
00:52:12,917 --> 00:52:15,157
I can't get ahold of Pat.

655
00:52:15,477 --> 00:52:19,037
Do you know where she moved to?

656
00:52:21,037 --> 00:52:23,557
I'm sorry, but I can't tell you.

657
00:52:23,957 --> 00:52:26,077
What I do know is that
you should stop bothering her

658
00:52:26,297 --> 00:52:27,957
because she's happy

659
00:52:28,477 --> 00:52:29,957
with her new love now.

660
00:52:30,077 --> 00:52:31,757
- "New love"?
- Yes.

661
00:52:31,797 --> 00:52:34,077
Pat has a new love?

662
00:52:34,277 --> 00:52:35,357
Who is it?

663
00:52:35,797 --> 00:52:37,917
Gotta go, too busy to talk.

664
00:52:43,637 --> 00:52:44,917
Pat has a new love?
