00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000


2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,080
Doctor!

3
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,640
It's not what you think!

4
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,360
- Prem!
- Wait, Pat!

5
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,040
Why was the doctor here?

6
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,760
And what's the matter?

7
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,440
Prem!

8
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,520
Prem...

9
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,880
Prem!

10
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,080
Let me explain!

11
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,040
Pat,

12
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,280
let go of me.

13
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,200
Prem, pull yourself together and listen to me.

14
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,760
Nothing happened.

15
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,080
I swear.

16
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,640
But I saw what you two were doing!

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,600
You got it all wrong!

18
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,040
I got it all wrong?

19
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,360
Friends...

20
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,960
aren't as intimate as you two were.

21
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,840
I wasn't intimate with her!

22
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,040
I was sleepy.

23
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,160
I didn't even know when I fell asleep.

24
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,040
Once I woke up, I saw you at the door!

25
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,400
Do you really think what you're saying

26
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,460
is believable?

27
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,360
Well, it's the truth.

28
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,360
What I saw was also the truth.

29
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,360
I trusted you, Pat.

30
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,600
I did it for your friend
who just went through a miscarriage.

31
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,560
You did the right thing.

32
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,200
Nothing truly happened.

33
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,560
Stop saying nothing happened!

34
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,480
Don't you understand

35
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,560
that I'm not comfortable with what I saw?

36
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,720
So what do you want me to do?

37
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,680
I don't know.

38
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,880
I don't know!

39
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,560
Can you give me just another chance?

40
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,160
I would never cheat on you.

41
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,280
Please trust me.

42
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,400
Trust...

43
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,000
is easily given the first time,

44
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,680
but once it's broken,

45
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,480
it's hard to earn back.

46
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:12,020
♫All I can do is hold back tears,
knowing our last days are near,♫

47
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:18,080
♫Even though the end is what we both fear♫

48
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:25,960
♫I keep telling myself I need to face reality,♫

49
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,600
I think you'll have to find a better way.

50
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,240
♫It's painful going against my heart♫

51
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,660
♫It's painful that we have to part♫

52
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:45,440
♫All I can say is a tearful goodbye♫

53
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,320
What happened, Pat?

54
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,600
I can't stay here with you tonight.

55
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,920
Was I the reason you and the doctor fought?

56
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,360
I can kinda tell.

57
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,080
I don't have anything against you dating her.

58
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,240
It's your personal choice, after all.

59
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,800
Thank you for getting it.

60
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,320
Earlier, Prem misunderstood us.

61
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,440
It was me.

62
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,920
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,960
My top was falling off,
so I leaned in to wake you up.

64
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,200
That's probably why she took it the wrong way.

65
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,760
I can tell her
my side of the story if you want.

66
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,920
It's fine.

67
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,440
I'll handle it.

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,880
Ow!

69
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,920
What's wrong, Nam?

70
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,200
I'm suddenly getting a cramp, Pat.

71
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,800
Ow...

72
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,800
Ow!

73
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,440
It'll take a moment.

74
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,520
- Hang in there.
- Ow!

75
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,880
I already called the nurse.

76
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,840
It's fine, Pat.

77
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,840
I'm okay. Just go.

78
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,000
Ouch...

79
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,160
- Ow...
- It's fine.

80
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,240
I'll stay for now.

81
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,960
It's okay, Pat.

82
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,520
Ow, ow...

83
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,160
I'm fine on my own...

84
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,920
Ouch!

85
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,760
Hang on, I'll get the nurse.

86
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,560
Ow!

87
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,280
[You have a new message]

88
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,440
Prem, are you feeling better now?

89
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,160
I'll stop by tomorrow.
Let's talk then.

90
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,520
[RAM2 Hospital]

91
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,120
Why the long face?

92
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,280
You were happy yesterday.

93
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,760
By the look of it,

94
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,560
you're mad at each other, aren't you?

95
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,480
That woman

96
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
had a miscarriage.

97
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,000
Hm?

98
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,960
Which one?

99
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,840
The one Thawat got pregnant.

100
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,480
Are you serious, Prem?

101
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,560
I am.

102
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,560
She's in recovery just upstairs.

103
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,000
Pat's taking care of her.

104
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,600
Right, because they are best friends.

105
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,200
Pat also had feelings for her.

106
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,120
And you're jealous?

107
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,160
I don't know what happened to me.

108
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,280
I've never been like this before.

109
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,200
That's how it is.

110
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,360
The more you love, the more jealous you get.

111
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,120
Talk it out nicely, Prem.

112
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,440
You're certainly
not the type to have a catfight over a lover.

113
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,200
You think that's funny, Tan?

114
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,480
He's right, though.

115
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,880
Just sit still, look pretty

116
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,280
as long as she doesn't do anything suspicious,

117
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,630
like Bow always does.

118
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,640
Sita!

119
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,160
I can't help you with that, Bow.

120
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,320
Just kidding.

121
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,200
It's good to be on the lookout, though.

122
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,800
Old flames die hard.

123
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,120
Don't let that woman
steal another lover from you.

124
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,760
Thank you for keeping me company, Pat.

125
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,240
Don't sweat it.

126
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,800
You're not cramping anymore?

127
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,760
Mm,

128
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,160
it's better.

129
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,800
I'm sorry

130
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,880
that I kept you from seeing Dr. Prem.

131
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,040
It's probably better
to give her time to cool down

132
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,320
so that we can reason with each other.

133
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,400
I don't mean to stick my nose in,

134
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,080
but I don't think
Thawat is giving up on her that easily.

135
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,000
Prem already left him behind.

136
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,680
How come you're so sure?

137
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,960
I trust her.

138
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,720
No matter what,
she's not going back to that douche.

139
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,600
Can I talk to you for a moment?

140
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,130
I'd prefer not to.

141
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,600
This time...

142
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,760
I'm not here to make excuses.

143
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,600
I just want to apologize.

144
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,080
So can we talk?

145
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,720
I want to apologize

146
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,680
for everything.

147
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,640
I admit I made a mistake,

148
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,680
but I'm now free from that woman.

149
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,720
Free?

150
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,240
Yeah.

151
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,120
I have no ties with her anymore.

152
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,760
How can you say that?

153
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,320
You're the reason she had a miscarriage!

154
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,080
You're supposed to take care of her now!

155
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,560
How did you know she had a miscarriage?

156
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,480
Did someone tell you?

157
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,040
It doesn't matter how,

158
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,440
but you can't just brush off
your own responsibility like that!

159
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:01,960
Prem...

160
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,920
I don't love that woman!

161
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,360
I love you!

162
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,280
Can you give me another chance?

163
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,160
There's no such thing anymore.

164
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,440
Marry me, Prem.

165
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,400
Let me go!

166
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,760
I'm not marrying you!

167
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,600
No, we have to, Prem.

168
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,920
I don't love you!

169
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,440
No, that's not true.

170
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,960
Get off her right now!

171
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,520
What don't you get about her not loving you?

172
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,160
And what does that have to do with you?

173
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,440
This is between Prem and me!

174
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,720
Prem's business is also mine!

175
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,760
I gave you a chance, Prem,

176
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,560
but you refused to choose me.

177
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,760
Don't come crying to me later.

178
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,420
Wait here, Prem.

179
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,680
Hey, you!

180
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,760
If you get any closer to her...

181
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,520
Why?

182
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,160
A woman like you is just a freak toy

183
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,320
that comes into her life.

184
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,320
Prem's just in a phase,

185
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,480
but once she comes to her senses,

186
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,840
she will know that I'm the real stuff!

187
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,160
Why do you still have the guts to meet him?

188
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,880
You know how he is!

189
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,960
You have the guts to go back
to your old flame, don't you?

190
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,760
Prem!

191
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,640
You're one to talk

192
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,280
when you still haven't dealt
with your problems?

193
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,200
I was gonna do that,

194
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,880
but I didn't think
I'd find him assaulting you!

195
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,040
What would happen
if I were here a little too late?

196
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,640
Too late?
You didn't even come last night.

197
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,000
Do you know

198
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,480
that I waited for you?

199
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,480
Nam had a stomach cramp last night.

200
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,440
It was beyond my control,

201
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,000
so I was planning to talk to you today.

202
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,160
And how did that turn out?

203
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,080
Was it as convenient as you thought?

204
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,200
Why are you so unreasonable?

205
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,360
So now I'm unreasonable?

206
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,120
I love you,

207
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,160
and I give you my sincerity,

208
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,720
yet you still don't trust me.

209
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,520
Have you done anything to earn that trust

210
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,000
apart from sending that one text

211
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,040
and disappearing for a night?

212
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,080
Maybe I set my expectations too high,

213
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,640
thinking you would put your trust in me

214
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,840
the same way I did in you.

215
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,280
Maybe I also set my expectations too high

216
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,200
that you would care more.

217
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,800
Everything I did all this time

218
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,600
is not enough proof?

219
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,400
That's a separate issue, Pat.

220
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,440
Do you want me to just cut her off?

221
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,360
I'm not saying that.

222
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,160
But it seems like you want me to.

223
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,160
I'm just gonna say this.

224
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,160
Nam is a lot more trustworthy than that jerk.

225
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,520
The one who should be jealous

226
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,120
is me

227
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,120
after seeing my own girlfriend
talking to her ex.

228
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,920
If you still don't get what I'm saying,

229
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,160
then we'd better not talk now!

230
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,160
Prem!

231
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,920
Get back to our conversation!

232
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,000
I want to be alone.

233
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,520
♫A forbidden love of two souls,♫

234
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,960
♫The more I suppress,♫

235
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,600
♫The more it unfolds♫

236
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,760
♫It's gonna cut deep, I know♫

237
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,800
♫I'm not supposed to yield,♫

238
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,360

♫As much as I want to hide,♫

240
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,880
♫I run back to your sight♫

241
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,600
♫Heavenly, yet it's hell,♫

242
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,840
♫Luring me before I fell♫

243
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,440
♫Into your loving realm,♫

244
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,580
♫No way to tear it apart♫

245
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,480
♫Like the thorns

246
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,920
♫Your love sinks me to the bottom♫

247

♫Forbidden to the touch,

252

Pat.

253
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,200
♫Like a moth to a flame♫

254
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,080
Pat.

255
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,120
♫A tether meant to claim,
pulling on my soul,♫

256
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,640
♫Chaining me tight, no matter where I go♫

257
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,440
♫A bitter love that stings♫

258
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,040
♫Tastes so sweet to the tongue,
its irresistible poison clings♫

♫Heavenly, yet it's hell,♫

♫Luring me before I fell♫

261
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,200
Do you know why I gave you this dollhouse?

262
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,360
It's because I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

263
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:06,280
♫Like the thorns
that pierce through my heart...♫

264
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,520
These are heart-shaped,
just like your pendant!

265
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,240
Exactly,

266
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,800
I gave you my heart,

267
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,800
so we can match.

268
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,960

Pat.

I don't know why you're sad.

272
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,760
But you still have me.

00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:53,520
♫Like the thorns

00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,520
Pat,

280
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,320
I want some orange juice.

281
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,480
Can you get it for me?

282
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,560
[Prem]

283
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,800
- Gosh!
- Oops...

284
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,520
It's all messy now!

285
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,000
I'm sorry, Pat!

286
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,360
You...go change upstairs in my bedroom.

287
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,200
There are some of your blouses.

288
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,920
Okay...

289
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,080
[Prem]

290
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,120
I'm leaving.

291
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,520
Pat, slow down.

292
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,640
Stay the night, Pat.

293
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,040
I can't.

294
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,160
Why?

295
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,880
Do you...

296
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,840
not want to be close to me anymore?

297
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,040
I have errands.

298
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,240
What errands?

299
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,040
What can be more important than me?

300
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,120
Please spend the night, Pat.

301
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,320
I miss you...

302
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,040
very much, even.

303
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,120
We're friends, Nam.

304
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,360
But I don't want to be just friends.

305
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,160
I know

306
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,960
that I brought you down,

307
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,680
but can I please get another chance?

308
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,280
This time...

309
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,800
I will make it up to you really nicely...

310
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,720
Don't do this, Nam.

311
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,920
Why not?

312
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,120
You have feelings for me, don't you?

313
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,640
That was all in the past, Nam.

314
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,920
It's over.

315
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,160
I'm with someone I love now.

316
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,960
Don't make me uncomfortable being around you.

317
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,680
Pat is mine.

318
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,680
You're just a rebound.

319
00:23:25,308 --> 00:23:26,308
Doctor!

320
00:23:26,788 --> 00:23:27,668
Yes?

321
00:23:28,868 --> 00:23:30,428
You were my patient yesterday, right?

322
00:23:30,668 --> 00:23:31,668
You got that right.

323
00:23:32,048 --> 00:23:34,428
You provided the best treatment yesterday,

324
00:23:34,728 --> 00:23:37,068
so I want to show
my appreciation with this dessert.

325
00:23:38,628 --> 00:23:39,748
This is for me?

326
00:23:39,788 --> 00:23:40,628
It is.

327
00:23:40,948 --> 00:23:41,628
Here.

328
00:23:43,428 --> 00:23:45,228
Thank you again, Doctor.

329
00:23:47,548 --> 00:23:49,028
Dr. Melanee,

330
00:23:49,268 --> 00:23:50,588
a word, please.

331
00:23:54,588 --> 00:23:55,588
Thank you.

332
00:23:57,148 --> 00:23:58,428
Please excuse me.

333
00:24:07,108 --> 00:24:08,428
I can't take my eyes off you, can I?

334
00:24:08,908 --> 00:24:10,268
What do you mean?

335
00:24:10,828 --> 00:24:13,708
The patient bought me a gift,
so I accepted it.

336
00:24:14,168 --> 00:24:15,508
Is that all?

337
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:17,148
It is.

338
00:24:20,508 --> 00:24:22,308
I thought you didn't like sweets?

339
00:24:24,508 --> 00:24:25,308
I don't.

340
00:24:27,868 --> 00:24:29,388
I prefer the taste of something else.

341
00:24:52,628 --> 00:24:54,388
This tastes a lot better.

342
00:25:12,308 --> 00:25:13,988
I'm sorry I'm late.

343
00:25:14,028 --> 00:25:15,908
I had to take care of something.

344
00:25:17,348 --> 00:25:18,508
It's alright.

345
00:25:19,348 --> 00:25:20,508
What did you want to talk about?

346
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,708
She seems like a piece of work.

347
00:25:40,948 --> 00:25:41,788
She is.

348
00:25:42,468 --> 00:25:45,028
I didn't think she would dare send it to me.

349
00:25:47,748 --> 00:25:49,468
Judging from the hidden camera

350
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:52,148
and how Pat looks reluctant,

351
00:25:52,788 --> 00:25:55,988
I think Nam's intention is pretty clear.

352
00:25:58,388 --> 00:26:00,988
At first, I was blinded by jealousy,

353
00:26:01,388 --> 00:26:03,228
but I have just realized

354
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:05,148
that she's being manipulative.

355
00:26:06,748 --> 00:26:08,348
How long have you been fighting?

356
00:26:12,068 --> 00:26:13,468
Five days.

357
00:26:15,428 --> 00:26:17,188
If you want my suggestions,

358
00:26:17,428 --> 00:26:20,188
I'd say that you two fighting doesn't help;

359
00:26:20,628 --> 00:26:22,628
it only makes things worse.

360
00:26:23,588 --> 00:26:24,828
Then...

361
00:26:25,108 --> 00:26:26,748
what should I do?

362
00:26:27,948 --> 00:26:31,388
Take it from someone
who has an excessively charming girlfriend,

363
00:26:31,728 --> 00:26:35,148
I think you need to make her realize

364
00:26:35,188 --> 00:26:37,548
that Pat is yours, no matter what.

365
00:26:42,828 --> 00:26:45,868
♫You can only fall for me♫

366
00:26:46,068 --> 00:26:48,468
So, have you made up with the doctor?

367
00:26:49,828 --> 00:26:51,548
What? Why not?

368
00:26:51,588 --> 00:26:53,068
Are you still mad at her?

369
00:26:53,468 --> 00:26:55,188
I'm tied up by Nam.

370
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:57,588
Nam...

371
00:26:58,068 --> 00:27:00,628
When will this name disappear from your book?

372
00:27:02,108 --> 00:27:04,108
I don't want anything to do with her anymore,

373
00:27:04,628 --> 00:27:06,268
but I also feel bad.

374
00:27:06,528 --> 00:27:08,068
Also, we've been friends for so long,

375
00:27:08,108 --> 00:27:11,428
yet I let that man
hurt her so bad she miscarried.

376
00:27:12,008 --> 00:27:13,748
You feel pity for her, right?

377
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:19,628
Pat, it's okay to feel that way,

378
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:21,988
but you gotta understand Dr. Prem.

379
00:27:22,268 --> 00:27:24,788
You're jealous of her and her ex,

380
00:27:24,828 --> 00:27:26,988
so why couldn't she be jealous of you and Nam?

381
00:27:27,508 --> 00:27:28,708
You're right...

382
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:34,308
But I was just hoping that
she'd trust me more.

383
00:27:34,868 --> 00:27:35,748
Pat,

384
00:27:35,788 --> 00:27:37,538
you're probably used to
being the youngest child

385
00:27:37,588 --> 00:27:39,868
who is always spoiled
by the people around you.

386
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:42,428
But in a relationship,

387
00:27:42,668 --> 00:27:45,388
you need to put yourself in her shoes.

388
00:27:50,188 --> 00:27:51,348
Let me put it this way:

389
00:27:51,768 --> 00:27:54,988
you can keep that huge ego
and avoid Dr. Prem all you want...

390
00:27:55,928 --> 00:27:57,228
but are you happy with that?

391
00:27:59,748 --> 00:28:00,908
No...

392
00:28:01,528 --> 00:28:03,308
I miss her,

393
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:05,268
her face,

394
00:28:06,008 --> 00:28:08,088
and her voice so, so bad.

395
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:09,908
There!

396
00:28:09,948 --> 00:28:11,748
So what are you waiting for?

397
00:28:12,628 --> 00:28:15,588
Did you seriously forget
how hard it was for you two to be together?

398
00:28:18,908 --> 00:28:20,868
Do you realize what to do now

399
00:28:21,388 --> 00:28:23,228
if you want her in your life?

400
00:28:41,228 --> 00:28:42,508
Prem,

401
00:28:43,008 --> 00:28:44,348
I'm sorry.

402
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:48,068
I didn't know my spoiled girl could say sorry.

403
00:28:51,908 --> 00:28:53,388
I'm sorry

404
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:55,908
that I behaved so horribly,

405
00:28:56,388 --> 00:28:58,908
but I never, ever thought
about cheating on you.

406
00:28:59,508 --> 00:29:01,188
I love no one else but you.

407
00:29:08,428 --> 00:29:09,988
I'm sorry, too,

408
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,788
that...I was quick-tempered.

409
00:29:14,948 --> 00:29:16,708
No need for you to be sorry.

410
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:18,548
It was my own fault.

411
00:29:21,308 --> 00:29:23,108
No more blaming yourself, alright?

412
00:29:23,988 --> 00:29:25,348
I'm not mad at you anymore.

413
00:29:30,108 --> 00:29:31,348
Then...

414
00:29:32,568 --> 00:29:33,948
Can we make up?

415
00:30:11,108 --> 00:30:13,988
I'll spend the night here, then.

416
00:30:14,768 --> 00:30:16,308
Don't you have to be with your friend?

417
00:30:18,508 --> 00:30:21,028
Well, I want to cuddle you to sleep.

418
00:30:22,508 --> 00:30:23,708
Fine,

419
00:30:24,248 --> 00:30:25,948
but you gotta go take a shower.

420
00:30:26,988 --> 00:30:28,148
You're full of germs now.

421
00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:31,348
Are you saying I'm a breeding ground?

422
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:33,148
You're not,

423
00:30:34,148 --> 00:30:36,228
but you were with one.

424
00:30:37,588 --> 00:30:38,988
Fine,

425
00:30:39,148 --> 00:30:40,668
I'll go wash up real good.

426
00:30:50,768 --> 00:30:54,108
Pat only went back to you
because I let her.

427
00:30:54,148 --> 00:30:56,428
Just for a fling, not forever.

428
00:31:03,868 --> 00:31:05,828
I smell good now!

429
00:31:16,348 --> 00:31:18,668
- Tickle, tickle...
- Pat!

430
00:31:19,188 --> 00:31:21,868
Tickle, tickle...

431
00:31:21,908 --> 00:31:24,028
Tickle, tickle...

432
00:31:25,828 --> 00:31:27,828
I think the tickler is getting tired.

433
00:31:29,448 --> 00:31:31,748
Can she fall asleep next to you?

434
00:31:32,268 --> 00:31:34,428
Isn't she all grown up now?

435
00:31:34,908 --> 00:31:35,908
Not yet.

436
00:31:36,468 --> 00:31:37,668
Let me sleep next to you, please?

437
00:31:37,948 --> 00:31:38,948
Let's cuddle.

438
00:31:39,268 --> 00:31:39,988
Mm.

439
00:31:52,028 --> 00:31:53,228
[Nam]

440
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:57,748
Hello?

441
00:31:57,788 --> 00:31:58,548
Pat...

442
00:31:58,828 --> 00:32:00,668
I don't want to live anymore.

443
00:32:02,148 --> 00:32:03,148
Nam, why would you...

444
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:04,628
Why would you say that?

445
00:32:04,908 --> 00:32:06,148
I mean it, Pat.

446
00:32:06,428 --> 00:32:08,428
No one loves me.

447
00:32:09,748 --> 00:32:11,628
I don't want to live like this.

448
00:32:12,428 --> 00:32:14,468
I want to die, Pat!

449
00:32:15,508 --> 00:32:17,388
Nam, I'll come over right now.

450
00:32:22,828 --> 00:32:24,788
Why do you smell so good today, Pat?

451
00:32:24,828 --> 00:32:26,628
Prem, I have to go.

452
00:32:34,188 --> 00:32:36,468
[Nam]

453
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:49,348
Pat?

454
00:32:51,388 --> 00:32:52,348
Pat!!

455
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:04,268
[Nam]

456
00:33:07,868 --> 00:33:09,948
I hate you, Dr. Prem!

457
00:33:27,668 --> 00:33:29,108
It's all because of you...

458
00:33:30,428 --> 00:33:32,108
Because of you...

459
00:34:04,748 --> 00:34:05,748
Nam!

460
00:34:41,468 --> 00:34:42,468
Nam,

461
00:34:42,888 --> 00:34:44,048
I'm begging you,

462
00:34:44,088 --> 00:34:45,668
can you please not do this again?

463
00:34:47,988 --> 00:34:49,988
Don't leave me again, then.

464
00:34:50,948 --> 00:34:53,308
But I can't be with you all the time!

465
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,008
Why not?

466
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:58,148
Do I disgust you now?

467
00:34:58,668 --> 00:34:59,668
No...

468
00:35:01,968 --> 00:35:03,828
Or do you hate me for real this time?

469
00:35:05,268 --> 00:35:06,468
No wonder...

470
00:35:06,508 --> 00:35:09,868
you don't care if I live or die.

471
00:35:09,988 --> 00:35:11,588
It's not like that!

472
00:35:12,408 --> 00:35:13,908
When I miscarried,

473
00:35:15,068 --> 00:35:16,548
I was all by myself.

474
00:35:18,508 --> 00:35:20,668
And now, you're leaving me again?

475
00:35:27,828 --> 00:35:29,388
You don't have to love me

476
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:31,628
the same way I love you,

477
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:34,068
as long as we're together.

478
00:35:35,088 --> 00:35:36,988
Can we please go back to the way we were?

479
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:40,828
Can you do that for me?

480
00:35:42,328 --> 00:35:44,388
Or at least...

481
00:35:44,668 --> 00:35:46,908
until I get better.

482
00:35:47,668 --> 00:35:48,668
Please, Pat...

483
00:36:20,616 --> 00:36:21,616
Prem,

484
00:36:21,716 --> 00:36:23,896
Sita told us that Nam

485
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,176
is harassing you?

486
00:36:28,136 --> 00:36:29,336
Tell us everything now.

487
00:36:46,576 --> 00:36:47,456
Whoa...

488
00:36:47,776 --> 00:36:49,376
This is hella creepy, Prem.

489
00:36:50,376 --> 00:36:51,096
Wait...

490
00:36:51,816 --> 00:36:53,216
she's been sending you all these?

491
00:36:55,116 --> 00:36:56,856
Not to mention the ones I deleted.

492
00:36:58,696 --> 00:37:00,256
I don't think this can go on.

493
00:37:00,856 --> 00:37:02,016
What are you gonna do, Bow?

494
00:37:03,536 --> 00:37:05,536
Do whatever a princess like you has to.

495
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:07,976
We'll play the fairy godparents.

496
00:37:22,896 --> 00:37:26,976
[You have a new message]

497
00:37:27,696 --> 00:37:29,576
I want to talk to you about Pat.

498
00:37:29,976 --> 00:37:32,296
I'm tired of competing with you.

499
00:37:44,376 --> 00:37:45,176
Pat,

500
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,456
I'll go out for some errands.

501
00:37:47,496 --> 00:37:48,976
Wait at home, okay?

502
00:37:49,216 --> 00:37:50,696
Can you go out alone?

503
00:37:51,296 --> 00:37:52,176
I can.

504
00:37:52,216 --> 00:37:53,496
It won't take long,

505
00:37:54,056 --> 00:37:55,936
but you have to be here when I get home.

506
00:37:56,776 --> 00:37:57,576
Mm.

507
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:00,776
I'll get changed, then.

508
00:38:30,296 --> 00:38:31,176
Please.

509
00:38:39,936 --> 00:38:41,656
You finally have the nerve to confront me,

510
00:38:41,936 --> 00:38:43,256
Dr. Premsinee?

511
00:38:43,576 --> 00:38:44,856
Why wouldn't I?

512
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:46,256
I thought you were a coward,

513
00:38:46,376 --> 00:38:48,616
considering how you enjoy
stealing other people's partners.

514
00:38:49,396 --> 00:38:51,296
I don't have to steal anyone

515
00:38:52,016 --> 00:38:53,376
because people...

516
00:38:53,836 --> 00:38:55,456
love approaching me.

517
00:38:56,456 --> 00:38:58,216
Unlike someone here

518
00:38:58,496 --> 00:39:00,296
who's desperate enough to do anything

519
00:39:00,536 --> 00:39:02,016
just to keep their lovers trapped,

520
00:39:02,696 --> 00:39:04,896
only to have them running for the hills.

521
00:39:04,996 --> 00:39:05,856
Hey!

522
00:39:05,936 --> 00:39:07,536
I'm not talking about you,

523
00:39:08,076 --> 00:39:09,446
but I don't mind

524
00:39:09,496 --> 00:39:10,496
if the shoe fits.

525
00:39:11,656 --> 00:39:13,536
Just say what you have to say.

526
00:39:14,016 --> 00:39:15,616
No need to act all angelic

527
00:39:15,656 --> 00:39:17,836
with that mouth spitting snide comments.

528
00:39:19,656 --> 00:39:22,256
If what I'm doing is spitting snide comments,

529
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:25,256
then what should we call your behaviors?

530
00:39:27,496 --> 00:39:29,216
Who in their right mind...

531
00:39:29,976 --> 00:39:32,056
would do what you're doing?

532
00:39:35,816 --> 00:39:37,976
She doesn't want you,
yet you're desperate to have her.

533
00:39:41,256 --> 00:39:42,496
Pat belongs to me!

534
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:44,776
Pat is not a property!

535
00:39:45,136 --> 00:39:46,576
She can decide

536
00:39:46,616 --> 00:39:48,296
who makes her happy.

537
00:39:48,696 --> 00:39:49,936
Stop talking!

538
00:39:50,576 --> 00:39:52,256
If she'd been happy with you,

539
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:54,416
she would've left me long ago.

540
00:39:54,736 --> 00:39:56,376
But I'm sure you heard

541
00:39:56,696 --> 00:39:59,216
how ecstatic she was with me.

542
00:40:00,316 --> 00:40:03,496
So, who do you think is a fling?

543
00:40:04,596 --> 00:40:05,976
What the hell are you doing, Nam?!

544
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:13,976
Prem, are you hurt?

545
00:40:18,296 --> 00:40:19,856
I'll tell you right here

546
00:40:20,096 --> 00:40:21,736
that I'm not yours.

547
00:40:22,816 --> 00:40:24,336
I belong to Prem,

548
00:40:24,496 --> 00:40:26,096
and I love her!

549
00:40:27,056 --> 00:40:27,976
No,

550
00:40:28,016 --> 00:40:29,176
you don't love her.

551
00:40:29,216 --> 00:40:31,466
Don't you see she set me up

552
00:40:31,506 --> 00:40:32,776
to provoke me!

553
00:40:32,896 --> 00:40:34,776
But you have no right to hurt her!

554
00:40:35,496 --> 00:40:37,256
Are you saying
she's more important than me?!

555
00:40:37,296 --> 00:40:38,256
Yes!

556
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:41,376
She's the most important person in my life!

557
00:40:42,056 --> 00:40:43,096
That's not true.

558
00:40:43,136 --> 00:40:44,016
But it is.

559
00:40:46,796 --> 00:40:48,456
It's time for you to wake up.

560
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:50,856
No,

561
00:40:51,216 --> 00:40:52,816
I gotta be the one you love the most!

562
00:40:53,096 --> 00:40:54,736
I don't love you anymore!

563
00:40:54,996 --> 00:40:56,576
Stop being so delusional!

564
00:40:57,776 --> 00:40:59,136
It's because of her, right?

565
00:40:59,176 --> 00:41:01,056
She's the reason you changed.

566
00:41:01,216 --> 00:41:02,656
I hate her!

567
00:41:02,696 --> 00:41:03,656
I'm gonna get you back!

568
00:41:03,696 --> 00:41:05,136
You can only be mine, Pat!

569
00:41:05,176 --> 00:41:06,176
Only mine!

570
00:41:06,216 --> 00:41:07,536
Pat's gotta be mine!

571
00:41:07,576 --> 00:41:08,336
It's you!

572
00:41:08,376 --> 00:41:09,256
Let go!

573
00:41:09,296 --> 00:41:10,406
Let go of me!

574
00:41:12,696 --> 00:41:14,136
It's because of you!

575
00:41:14,576 --> 00:41:16,136
It's all because of you!!

576
00:41:24,146 --> 00:41:24,816
Pat...

577
00:41:30,536 --> 00:41:31,416
Pat...

578
00:41:33,176 --> 00:41:33,976
Pat?

579
00:41:44,016 --> 00:41:46,176
I have given you so many chances,

580
00:41:47,536 --> 00:41:49,056
yet you throw them down the drain.

581
00:41:49,576 --> 00:41:50,976
I'm sorry.

582
00:41:51,136 --> 00:41:53,376
I didn't mean to hurt you, Pat.

583
00:41:54,216 --> 00:41:55,936
You can hurt me all you want,

584
00:41:56,776 --> 00:41:58,336
but don't lay your hands on Prem.

585
00:42:01,376 --> 00:42:02,696
I'm sorry...

586
00:42:03,016 --> 00:42:03,896
I...

587
00:42:04,976 --> 00:42:06,256
I just lost it.

588
00:42:06,296 --> 00:42:08,576
I really didn't mean to, Pat.

589
00:42:08,796 --> 00:42:10,376
Please don't be mad at me.

590
00:42:11,296 --> 00:42:13,496
From now on, we're strangers.

591
00:42:15,296 --> 00:42:16,376
No...

592
00:42:17,376 --> 00:42:19,136
I'm... I'm sorry...

593
00:42:19,576 --> 00:42:21,656
Pat, please don't be mad at me...

594
00:42:21,976 --> 00:42:23,896
I didn't mean to.

595
00:42:23,936 --> 00:42:26,136
I really didn't, Pat...

596
00:42:26,376 --> 00:42:28,696
I really didn't mean to.

597
00:42:34,216 --> 00:42:35,056
Pat,

598
00:42:35,456 --> 00:42:37,776
everything I did

599
00:42:37,816 --> 00:42:39,616
was out of my love for you.

600
00:42:40,536 --> 00:42:42,216
I really do love you.

601
00:42:43,696 --> 00:42:45,016
You don't;

602
00:42:47,056 --> 00:42:50,016
you just can't bear the thought of me
loving someone else more than you.

603
00:42:52,656 --> 00:42:53,656
Pat...

604
00:42:55,416 --> 00:42:57,176
Please don't leave me.

605
00:42:59,416 --> 00:43:01,136
Come on, I'll treat your wound...

606
00:43:01,176 --> 00:43:02,096
Enough!

607
00:43:02,576 --> 00:43:05,056
Don't make me hate you more than I do.

608
00:43:05,696 --> 00:43:06,856
Please...

609
00:43:10,416 --> 00:43:12,816
get out of my life.

610
00:43:18,456 --> 00:43:21,216
And if you don't want
to be charged for assault,

611
00:43:21,576 --> 00:43:23,896
don't show your face to me or Prem again.

612
00:43:26,176 --> 00:43:27,056
Prem,

613
00:43:27,296 --> 00:43:28,736
let's take Pat in for her injury.

614
00:43:33,896 --> 00:43:35,496
Let's go to the hospital.

615
00:43:40,296 --> 00:43:42,016
I'm sorry...

616
00:43:43,216 --> 00:43:45,216
I'm sorry...

617
00:43:50,036 --> 00:43:51,736
Pat!

618
00:43:53,776 --> 00:43:55,936
I'm sorry...

619
00:43:58,336 --> 00:44:00,936
[RAM2 Hospital]

620
00:44:01,016 --> 00:44:01,736
Tan,

621
00:44:01,936 --> 00:44:03,616
what do you think
the end of that woman will be?

622
00:44:03,936 --> 00:44:04,856
What, Bow?

623
00:44:05,456 --> 00:44:07,176
Haven't you already had one in mind?

624
00:44:07,536 --> 00:44:08,576
So why are you asking?

625
00:44:09,196 --> 00:44:10,196
Whatever.

626
00:44:10,236 --> 00:44:12,096
Let's say, the plan
to have the princess bullied

627
00:44:12,136 --> 00:44:13,336
in front of the knight

628
00:44:13,536 --> 00:44:14,416
was a success.

629
00:44:16,496 --> 00:44:17,216
Pat,

630
00:44:17,496 --> 00:44:18,376
this is Bow.

631
00:44:18,616 --> 00:44:20,016
We have to talk.

632
00:44:20,216 --> 00:44:21,936
Where are you? I'll come find you.

633
00:44:23,336 --> 00:44:25,736
Look at what your friend did to mine.

634
00:44:47,176 --> 00:44:48,336
This is not all of it.

635
00:44:48,636 --> 00:44:49,436
Look.

636
00:44:56,376 --> 00:44:57,176
Bow,

637
00:44:58,236 --> 00:45:00,236
can we consider ourselves the good ones?

638
00:45:00,976 --> 00:45:02,176
We rented out the restaurant

639
00:45:02,216 --> 00:45:04,016
just to set the whole thing up.

640
00:45:05,216 --> 00:45:08,016
Princesses don't always have to be the victim.

641
00:45:18,936 --> 00:45:19,856
Nam,

642
00:45:20,136 --> 00:45:21,776
what took you so long?

643
00:45:28,616 --> 00:45:30,336
I had to take care of something, Pat.

644
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:34,176
Well, then, let's find
something yummy to eat.

645
00:45:35,456 --> 00:45:36,296
Mm...

646
00:46:56,724 --> 00:46:58,044
Prem...

647
00:46:58,924 --> 00:47:00,724
Is there anything you want to say?

648
00:47:01,284 --> 00:47:02,924
I'm sorry

649
00:47:03,784 --> 00:47:06,044
for how completely clueless I was.

650
00:47:06,684 --> 00:47:08,924
You even got hurt because of me,

651
00:47:09,644 --> 00:47:11,844
not to mention those crazy texts and videos.

652
00:47:13,284 --> 00:47:15,244
Bow already showed everything to me.

653
00:47:15,684 --> 00:47:17,044
Those videos were deceptive.

654
00:47:17,404 --> 00:47:19,844
Nam edited them.

655
00:47:20,085 --> 00:47:23,325
I genuinely could never love
anyone else, Prem.

656
00:47:29,804 --> 00:47:31,124
I know.

657
00:47:36,124 --> 00:47:37,724
I can't believe

658
00:47:38,544 --> 00:47:40,764
that Nam could do
all those horrendous things to me.

659
00:47:42,404 --> 00:47:44,284
I always thought

660
00:47:44,324 --> 00:47:46,524
she was a good friend.

661
00:47:53,364 --> 00:47:54,644
Sometimes,

662
00:47:55,144 --> 00:47:57,204
you might think that
you know something really well,

663
00:47:59,044 --> 00:48:01,804
when, in fact,
you don't know anything at all.

664
00:48:02,624 --> 00:48:04,044
You're a woman,

665
00:48:04,884 --> 00:48:06,604
so you must know

666
00:48:06,644 --> 00:48:09,564
how complicated our emotions can get.

667
00:48:15,524 --> 00:48:17,444
Please just be angry at me.

668
00:48:18,004 --> 00:48:19,764
I feel horrible.

669
00:48:28,284 --> 00:48:29,284
What are you saying?

670
00:48:29,564 --> 00:48:31,244
It's better this way, right?

671
00:48:35,404 --> 00:48:36,684
But...

672
00:48:36,984 --> 00:48:40,364
in the soap opera, when the leads
fight because of a third party,

673
00:48:40,604 --> 00:48:42,324
they usually end up in bed.

674
00:48:43,884 --> 00:48:45,604
I want that kind of experience.

675
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:49,364
Be careful what you wish for.

676
00:48:50,364 --> 00:48:51,764
Go take your meds.

677
00:48:53,444 --> 00:48:54,324
Hurry.

678
00:48:57,264 --> 00:48:58,584
Come on, let's get you the meds.

679
00:48:59,684 --> 00:49:00,564
Alright?

680
00:49:05,964 --> 00:49:06,844
Come on,

681
00:49:07,004 --> 00:49:07,884
sit.

682
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:15,564
This is an anti-inflammatory pill.

683
00:49:15,964 --> 00:49:17,484
It's a capsule, so it's not bitter.

684
00:49:18,344 --> 00:49:19,344
Hold out your hand.

685
00:49:21,284 --> 00:49:22,304
Please?

686
00:49:32,084 --> 00:49:33,444
I can't take it.

687
00:49:35,084 --> 00:49:36,284
My arm hurts.

688
00:49:38,924 --> 00:49:40,164
Don't be so stubborn.

689
00:49:45,964 --> 00:49:46,884
Take it.

690
00:49:47,524 --> 00:49:49,044
The capsule's not gonna be bitter.

691
00:49:51,664 --> 00:49:53,404
Give it to me, please?

692
00:49:54,844 --> 00:49:57,124
My arm really does hurt!

693
00:50:12,444 --> 00:50:17,164
♫You're the love I'm longing for♫

694
00:50:17,364 --> 00:50:21,884
♫The heaven-sent one I adore♫

695
00:50:22,084 --> 00:50:28,164
♫The final answer to my prayers♫

696
00:50:31,324 --> 00:50:32,244
Drink some water.

697
00:50:40,244 --> 00:50:42,004
Don't hold water in your mouth!

698
00:50:53,324 --> 00:50:54,804
Thank you.

699
00:50:56,684 --> 00:50:58,524
Get well soon, alright?

700
00:51:02,204 --> 00:51:04,164
From now on, if something happens,

701
00:51:04,444 --> 00:51:06,684
you gotta tell me
everything about it, okay?

702
00:51:06,804 --> 00:51:08,164
Let's not have secrets anymore.

703
00:51:09,884 --> 00:51:11,764
I'll tell you everything.

704
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:21,604
♫My heart will belong to you forever♫

705
00:51:23,164 --> 00:51:24,164
What business do you have?

706
00:51:24,304 --> 00:51:25,564
The same as last time.

707
00:51:26,924 --> 00:51:27,924
If so,

708
00:51:27,964 --> 00:51:29,044
the answer's the same.

709
00:51:30,164 --> 00:51:32,124
We decided to leave it to Prem.

710
00:51:32,164 --> 00:51:33,644
If she doesn't want to give you a chance,

711
00:51:33,984 --> 00:51:35,844
then we can't help you.

712
00:51:36,164 --> 00:51:37,924
Father, Mother,

713
00:51:37,964 --> 00:51:40,684
hasn't it crossed your minds to change her?

714
00:51:43,804 --> 00:51:45,044
What are you trying to say, Thawat?

715
00:51:45,444 --> 00:51:47,244
So you don't know

716
00:51:47,284 --> 00:51:48,844
that your sweet little daughter

717
00:51:49,204 --> 00:51:50,364
likes women now?

718
00:52:07,364 --> 00:52:09,124
Why are you doing this?!

719
00:52:09,724 --> 00:52:11,964
I don't mind

720
00:52:12,004 --> 00:52:13,724
that Prem's going astray.

721
00:52:14,084 --> 00:52:16,004
I still want to marry her.

722
00:52:18,564 --> 00:52:19,564
That's too bad.

723
00:52:20,204 --> 00:52:21,724
Are you rejecting me, Father?

724
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:22,564
Exactly.

725
00:52:26,004 --> 00:52:27,204
Now, get out of my house.

726
00:52:27,424 --> 00:52:29,644
Thank you for letting us know

727
00:52:29,684 --> 00:52:33,084
what an incompetent man you are,
failing to earn her love.

728
00:52:34,844 --> 00:52:36,084
Incompetent...

729
00:52:37,724 --> 00:52:40,524
Am I incompetent,
or is your daughter a freak?

730
00:52:40,684 --> 00:52:41,524
Hey!

731
00:52:42,244 --> 00:52:44,604
That kind of manner
won't be tolerated in this house!

732
00:52:45,444 --> 00:52:47,084
When you cheated on her,

733
00:52:47,124 --> 00:52:49,924
we never thought
to ask you to pay for what you did.

734
00:52:50,404 --> 00:52:52,204
And now, you're pressuring us?!

735
00:52:52,764 --> 00:52:54,764
Just leave my daughter alone.

736
00:52:54,964 --> 00:52:57,964
Then, you can go around
parading your freak of a daughter.

737
00:52:58,284 --> 00:52:59,524
But don't ever think

738
00:52:59,564 --> 00:53:01,884
that someone like me will beg for her back.

739
00:53:02,684 --> 00:53:05,364
And if people know that
your sweet Prem is a dyke...

740
00:53:06,404 --> 00:53:07,524
who would want her?

741
00:53:07,724 --> 00:53:08,724

I'm getting out, alright.

744
00:53:12,604 --> 00:53:13,924
But just remember

00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:18,084
what a revolting being she is.

746
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:22,764
Why don't you look
at yourself in the mirror?!

747
00:53:23,084 --> 00:53:24,284
Bastard!!

748
00:53:35,044 --> 00:53:36,204
