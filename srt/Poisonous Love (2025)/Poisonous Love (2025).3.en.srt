00:00:00,007 --> 00:00:01,007


2
00:00:10,334 --> 00:00:12,334
From this moment on,

3
00:00:12,934 --> 00:00:14,734
I'm gonna win you over.

4
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:50,247
♫No words needed to realize you're the one♫

5
00:00:50,287 --> 00:01:00,214
♫I was born to be the moon to your sun♫

6
00:01:00,774 --> 00:01:08,175
♫With you by my side,
there's nothing else I'd like♫

7
00:01:09,334 --> 00:01:13,854
♫You're the love I'm longing for♫

8
00:01:14,094 --> 00:01:18,134
♫The heaven-sent one I adore♫

9
00:01:18,174 --> 00:01:19,014
Doc!

10
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:24,934
♫The final answer to my prayers♫

11
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:32,134
♫My heart will belong to you♫

12
00:01:44,894 --> 00:01:46,054
I kissed...

13
00:01:46,534 --> 00:01:47,694
a woman.

14
00:01:48,054 --> 00:01:50,094
From this moment on,

15
00:01:50,134 --> 00:01:51,974
I'm gonna win you over.

16
00:02:08,047 --> 00:02:09,540
Her lips are so soft.

17
00:02:19,614 --> 00:02:21,774
[Nam]

18
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:43,814
[Nam]

19
00:03:12,414 --> 00:03:14,174
I know you saw me, Doc.

20
00:03:16,094 --> 00:03:17,854
Can you open the door for me, please?

21
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:22,614
What are you so afraid

22
00:03:23,534 --> 00:03:25,054
I'll do to you?

23
00:03:29,814 --> 00:03:31,694
What more do you need, Miss Pat?

24
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:34,654
I just thought
I should introduce myself to my neighbor.

25
00:03:35,054 --> 00:03:36,054
That's everything, right?

26
00:03:39,054 --> 00:03:41,054
I wanna say I like it.

27
00:03:43,214 --> 00:03:44,214
What are you talking about?

28
00:03:44,534 --> 00:03:45,534
I'm talking about

29
00:03:46,214 --> 00:03:47,534
what happened in the elevator.

30
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,174
Is the feeling one-sided?

31
00:03:59,774 --> 00:04:00,854
I doubt it.

32
00:04:01,214 --> 00:04:02,854
You seemed pretty into it, too.

33
00:04:03,614 --> 00:04:05,254
You're pretty good at imagining things.

34
00:04:05,494 --> 00:04:07,214
I'm not imagining things

35
00:04:08,094 --> 00:04:10,334
since it didn't look like
you wanted to back off.

36
00:04:11,614 --> 00:04:12,476
I was...

37
00:04:12,812 --> 00:04:13,734
I...

38
00:04:13,774 --> 00:04:14,894
I was just stunned

39
00:04:15,207 --> 00:04:16,407
since it caught me off guard.

40
00:04:16,974 --> 00:04:17,854
Were you?

41
00:04:18,694 --> 00:04:19,334
Yes.

42
00:04:19,974 --> 00:04:21,454
I'm not gonna make a big deal out of this.

43
00:04:21,633 --> 00:04:24,374
I'll just assume you were so startled

44
00:04:24,414 --> 00:04:27,014
that you weren't acting like yourself.

45
00:04:28,374 --> 00:04:29,614
But don't you ever think

46
00:04:30,534 --> 00:04:32,294
of pulling a fast one on me again!

47
00:04:37,374 --> 00:04:38,934
She's just here to get on my nerves!

48
00:04:39,734 --> 00:04:40,894
It's not a bad decision

49
00:04:41,254 --> 00:04:43,334
to move to the same condo as hers.

50
00:04:44,014 --> 00:04:45,654
I really want to start fresh.

51
00:04:46,374 --> 00:04:47,374
What should I do?

52
00:04:48,494 --> 00:04:49,494
I have an idea!

53
00:04:50,614 --> 00:04:52,694
Since you're influential

54
00:04:53,134 --> 00:04:54,334
and know a lot of people,

55
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,534
can you find out

56
00:04:56,774 --> 00:04:58,094
where Dr. Prem lives?

57
00:04:58,414 --> 00:04:59,934
Pat, you crazy girl!

58
00:05:00,194 --> 00:05:02,014
This is not something you can just do!

59
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:03,494
Except that you can.

60
00:05:03,734 --> 00:05:05,414
You never, ever miss

61
00:05:05,454 --> 00:05:07,534
where your partner's
little side pieces are.

62
00:05:08,054 --> 00:05:09,214
This can be done

63
00:05:09,734 --> 00:05:10,614
with your eyes shut.

64
00:05:11,334 --> 00:05:12,894
Help me, would you?

65
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:17,894
She lives in Canapaya Residences?!

66
00:05:17,934 --> 00:05:20,054
Yeah, and why would you be so thrilled?

67
00:05:20,574 --> 00:05:23,174
My brother bought a unit there!

68
00:05:25,174 --> 00:05:27,214
God is finally on my side.

69
00:06:17,974 --> 00:06:19,094
Morning, Doc.

70
00:06:36,094 --> 00:06:37,094
Hey, you!

71
00:06:37,454 --> 00:06:39,494
Do you get off work at the usual time?

72
00:06:39,654 --> 00:06:41,214
Maybe we can eat noodles again.

73
00:06:42,994 --> 00:06:44,614
Give me back my earphone.

74
00:06:44,974 --> 00:06:47,294
Or should we go see a movie?

75
00:06:47,614 --> 00:06:49,134
There are tons of new ones in theaters.

76
00:06:49,654 --> 00:06:51,214
I can even rent out a whole theater,

77
00:06:51,514 --> 00:06:53,054
so we can be alone.

78
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,687
I don't want to see it.

79
00:06:54,727 --> 00:06:56,574
Then, what do you want to do, Doc?

80
00:06:57,154 --> 00:06:58,574
I want my earphone back.

81
00:07:00,094 --> 00:07:01,094
I'll give it back.

82
00:07:02,514 --> 00:07:04,254
But can you just listen to me first?

83
00:07:04,734 --> 00:07:06,414
Make it quick.

84
00:07:09,654 --> 00:07:11,934
I know that
you've never been into women before.

85
00:07:12,254 --> 00:07:13,414
Good for you.

86
00:07:14,454 --> 00:07:16,254
But being with a woman is really good.

87
00:07:17,254 --> 00:07:18,814
We're more understanding,

88
00:07:19,432 --> 00:07:21,144
more considerate,

89
00:07:21,694 --> 00:07:22,974
and...

90
00:07:23,554 --> 00:07:24,974
a lot safer.

91
00:07:26,694 --> 00:07:27,814
Safer?

92
00:07:28,094 --> 00:07:29,694
You're the danger itself.

93
00:07:30,174 --> 00:07:34,574
♫You make me melt
every time you lean closer♫

94
00:07:34,814 --> 00:07:39,574
♫Your gaze makes me lose my mind♫

95
00:07:39,614 --> 00:07:44,174
♫You're the only one I want by my side♫

96
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,214
Don't follow me.

97
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:48,454
Fine,

98
00:07:49,054 --> 00:07:50,054
I won't

99
00:07:50,621 --> 00:07:52,591
since we will definitely
see each other again.

100
00:07:53,454 --> 00:07:55,774
♫Come taste me, and you will see♫

101
00:07:55,814 --> 00:07:58,174
♫How much I want you, baby♫

102
00:07:58,214 --> 00:08:02,814
♫What will it take for you to cave in?♫

103
00:08:12,254 --> 00:08:13,654
Pat!

104
00:08:15,214 --> 00:08:18,294
Thank you so much
for helping me with the live stream.

105
00:08:18,334 --> 00:08:20,494
The shoe sales are insane!

106
00:08:20,794 --> 00:08:22,134
I'm so happy for you.

107
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:24,494
Your shoes are of good quality;

108
00:08:24,534 --> 00:08:25,974
it's not just because of me.

109
00:08:26,654 --> 00:08:28,494
Well, you're right about that!

110
00:08:30,234 --> 00:08:32,334
But if there's any more work
for me in the future,

111
00:08:32,374 --> 00:08:34,134
you can contact me directly.

112
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:36,414
Wait, what about Nam?

113
00:08:36,614 --> 00:08:38,814
Isn't she your manager anymore?

114
00:08:57,494 --> 00:08:58,494
Thank you.

115
00:09:02,014 --> 00:09:04,174
Pick whatever you wanna eat, Pat.

116
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:08,894
What do you feel like today?

117
00:09:09,134 --> 00:09:11,654
Maybe... some noodles?

118
00:09:11,694 --> 00:09:13,174
That's your favorite dish,

119
00:09:13,614 --> 00:09:15,334
and this restaurant
makes delicious noodles.

120
00:09:17,334 --> 00:09:18,694
Just order it.

121
00:09:18,894 --> 00:09:19,494
Mm,

122
00:09:19,534 --> 00:09:22,374
I'll go ahead and order the noodles.

123
00:09:22,414 --> 00:09:24,334
If you're feeling something more,

124
00:09:24,374 --> 00:09:26,014
just go ahead and tell me.

125
00:09:28,454 --> 00:09:30,334
One noodle soup,

126
00:09:30,374 --> 00:09:32,934
one spaghetti carbonara,

127
00:09:32,974 --> 00:09:34,054
and two cups of green tea,

128
00:09:34,254 --> 00:09:35,174
please.

129
00:09:35,854 --> 00:09:37,054
Here.

130
00:10:25,774 --> 00:10:27,014
Don't you even think

131
00:10:27,214 --> 00:10:29,054
I'm gonna make a wife out of you.

132
00:10:30,454 --> 00:10:31,694
Your kind of woman

133
00:10:32,054 --> 00:10:34,054
doesn't deserve someone like me.

134
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:40,472
- Alright.
- Alright.

135
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,327
Be right back.

136
00:10:52,574 --> 00:10:55,494
I'll use the restroom, then.

137
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:10,054
Hello?

138
00:11:10,094 --> 00:11:12,294
Sweet Prem, it's me.

139
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:13,774
I want to talk.

140
00:11:13,814 --> 00:11:14,954
Can we please just meet?

141
00:11:19,774 --> 00:11:20,442
Thawat,

142
00:11:20,694 --> 00:11:22,214
I don't have anything more to say.

143
00:11:22,414 --> 00:11:24,014
Please stop calling!

144
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,478
Hi, Miss Prem.

145
00:11:33,014 --> 00:11:34,254
You...

146
00:11:35,054 --> 00:11:36,254
You know me?

147
00:11:36,734 --> 00:11:37,454
Of course.

148
00:11:37,774 --> 00:11:39,814
I'm the mother of Thawat's baby.

149
00:11:49,654 --> 00:11:50,654
Excuse me?

150
00:12:00,614 --> 00:12:02,014
What do you want from me?

151
00:12:05,174 --> 00:12:06,854
I just wanna see you up close.

152
00:12:07,414 --> 00:12:08,534
You have a pretty face

153
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:10,334
and a respectable job;

154
00:12:10,534 --> 00:12:12,574
why are you still
holding onto someone else's man?

155
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:15,414
Look at the nerve you have
to claim him as your man,

156
00:12:15,574 --> 00:12:17,014
even though you stole him.

157
00:12:17,054 --> 00:12:18,134
I didn't.

158
00:12:18,294 --> 00:12:19,934
You're the one stealing Thawat from me!

159
00:12:20,374 --> 00:12:21,214
If it wasn't for you,

160
00:12:21,254 --> 00:12:22,894
he wouldn't have left me!

161
00:12:23,574 --> 00:12:24,574
Oh,

162
00:12:25,514 --> 00:12:27,014
so he dumped you.

163
00:12:27,894 --> 00:12:28,974
That figures.

164
00:12:29,734 --> 00:12:31,094
Why don't you look in the mirror

165
00:12:31,694 --> 00:12:33,214
before pointing fingers at someone?

166
00:12:33,814 --> 00:12:36,734
You have no shame in being a home-wrecker,

167
00:12:37,774 --> 00:12:39,454
and now you're even turning into a bully?

168
00:12:41,654 --> 00:12:42,654
Please just stop.

169
00:12:43,414 --> 00:12:44,974
At least for the sake of your baby.

170
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:46,974
Hey, you!

171
00:12:49,766 --> 00:12:50,804
Nam, stop that right now!

172
00:12:59,254 --> 00:12:59,934
Pat,

173
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:02,079
this woman was being rude to me.

174
00:13:02,134 --> 00:13:03,694
She accused me of being a home-wrecker

175
00:13:03,734 --> 00:13:05,174
and even insulted me!

176
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,894
My friend is never
the type to start a fight!

177
00:13:09,774 --> 00:13:11,014
If you want a problem,

178
00:13:11,454 --> 00:13:12,654
I can give you one right now.

179
00:13:12,694 --> 00:13:13,694
Bow, don't.

180
00:13:17,614 --> 00:13:19,294
Keep a close eye on your friend.

181
00:13:19,934 --> 00:13:21,454
Don't let her bother me ever again.

182
00:13:36,214 --> 00:13:37,134
Nam,

183
00:13:37,174 --> 00:13:38,894
why would you mess with her like that?!

184
00:13:39,394 --> 00:13:40,487
It's all because of her!

185
00:13:40,527 --> 00:13:43,134
That witch is the reason
I ended up like this!

186
00:13:43,374 --> 00:13:44,614
Wake up, Nam!

187
00:13:44,814 --> 00:13:46,698
You're the one to blame here,

188
00:13:47,054 --> 00:13:48,047
not Dr. Prem!

189
00:13:48,253 --> 00:13:49,894
Why aren't you on my side?

190
00:13:49,942 --> 00:13:52,502
I won't side with the wrong anymore.

191
00:13:52,534 --> 00:13:53,495
But she said

192
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,014
she already forgave Thawat.

193
00:13:57,014 --> 00:13:57,897
How did you know that?

194
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,522
Well, those are her words.

195
00:14:01,134 --> 00:14:02,014
You weren't here before;

196
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:04,039
you didn't hear half
of what she said to me!

197
00:14:05,734 --> 00:14:06,974
Let's call it a day right here.

198
00:14:07,374 --> 00:14:08,374
I wanna go home.

199
00:14:09,134 --> 00:14:09,914
Pat!

200
00:14:10,774 --> 00:14:12,494
So I will see you tomorrow?

201
00:14:12,634 --> 00:14:14,231
I took on a perfume brand's launch event

202
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:15,654
on the day after tomorrow for you.

203
00:14:17,334 --> 00:14:18,814
I already told you

204
00:14:19,478 --> 00:14:21,158
not to take on any gigs without asking me!

205
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:22,704
I want to take a break.

206
00:14:22,814 --> 00:14:24,414
So what do you want me to do?

207
00:14:24,574 --> 00:14:26,174
I already accepted it!

208
00:14:26,214 --> 00:14:27,934
You made your bed, now lie in it.

209
00:14:28,254 --> 00:14:28,934
Pat!

210
00:14:29,174 --> 00:14:29,908
Pat!

211
00:14:38,334 --> 00:14:39,516
Hello, Thawat.

212
00:14:40,574 --> 00:14:41,574
Of course, Thawat.

213
00:14:42,714 --> 00:14:44,254
I'll be waiting at home.

214
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,254
Alright.

215
00:14:53,054 --> 00:14:53,854
Prem,

216
00:14:55,974 --> 00:14:56,974
are you alright?

217
00:14:58,654 --> 00:15:00,934
Mm, I am.

218
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:02,254
Don't worry.

219
00:15:02,614 --> 00:15:03,814
What a small world we live in.

220
00:15:04,134 --> 00:15:05,254
Out of all the restaurants,

221
00:15:05,854 --> 00:15:07,174
why did they have to eat here?

222
00:15:08,014 --> 00:15:09,334
I hope we've seen the last of them.

223
00:15:10,714 --> 00:15:11,807
What a demon!

224
00:15:11,847 --> 00:15:13,694
And the woman who crashed your wedding?

225
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:15,374
With all honesty,

226
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,734
I hate her to the bone.

227
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,454
I wanna say I like it.

228
00:15:55,175 --> 00:15:56,055
Nam,

229
00:16:19,755 --> 00:16:21,115
I'm pretty stressed out today.

230
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:24,755
Can you help take a load off my mind?

231
00:16:40,635 --> 00:16:42,675
I heard you went back to that guy?

232
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,295
Where did you hear that from?

233
00:16:45,095 --> 00:16:46,495
Because if it's from your friend,

234
00:16:47,135 --> 00:16:48,478
you might need to use your discretion.

235
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,228
Is it true, though?

236
00:16:50,935 --> 00:16:52,875
I don't have to confirm
or deny that with you.

237
00:16:53,295 --> 00:16:55,355
Well, I don't want you to go back to him.

238
00:16:55,895 --> 00:16:57,675
The reason you don't want me to

239
00:16:58,055 --> 00:16:59,715
is because you care
about your friend, right?

240
00:17:00,455 --> 00:17:01,675
I don't care about her.

241
00:17:02,575 --> 00:17:03,755
I care about you, Doc.

242
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,075
So now you're on my side?

243
00:17:13,515 --> 00:17:15,115
Isn't that obvious?

244
00:17:19,015 --> 00:17:21,375
I know my friend has done you wrong,

245
00:17:21,815 --> 00:17:22,888
and I'm sorry

246
00:17:22,928 --> 00:17:24,475
for how she treated you.

247
00:17:26,495 --> 00:17:28,135
But I've never regretted

248
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:30,595
breaking off your engagement to that guy.

249
00:17:30,935 --> 00:17:31,975
Look, Miss Pat,

250
00:17:33,015 --> 00:17:35,755
I don't believe that you actually like me.

251
00:17:36,795 --> 00:17:38,715
You're a friend of the person who hurt me.

252
00:17:38,935 --> 00:17:40,675
How do you expect me to trust you?

253
00:17:43,235 --> 00:17:45,395
I don't even know
what your intention is anymore.

254
00:17:46,395 --> 00:17:48,995
Are you saying
I have to prove myself to you?

255
00:18:09,995 --> 00:18:11,035
This bruise...

256
00:18:11,515 --> 00:18:13,035
She gave it to you, didn't she?

257
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:35,795
♫No words needed to realize you're the one♫

258
00:18:36,035 --> 00:18:41,475
♫I was born to be...♫

259
00:18:42,435 --> 00:18:43,427
I will never let anyone

260
00:18:43,451 --> 00:18:45,936
leave any marks
on your beautiful arms again.

261
00:18:46,536 --> 00:18:53,755
♫With you by my side,
there's nothing else I'd like♫

262
00:18:55,115 --> 00:18:59,688
♫You're the love I'm longing for♫

263
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:04,243
♫The heaven-sent one I adore♫

264
00:19:04,782 --> 00:19:10,743
♫The final answer to my prayers♫

265
00:19:13,415 --> 00:19:18,147
♫My heart will belong to you♫

266
00:19:18,215 --> 00:19:20,715
Are you saying
I have to prove myself to you?

267
00:19:38,435 --> 00:19:41,955
[Mother]

268
00:19:43,495 --> 00:19:45,075
Hello, Mother?

269
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:49,373
Yes,

270
00:19:50,335 --> 00:19:51,795
I'll stop by tomorrow.

271
00:20:07,995 --> 00:20:09,475
What do you want to do next, Prem?

272
00:20:09,915 --> 00:20:12,955
Thawat has already come to speak to us.

273
00:20:13,595 --> 00:20:14,915
What did he say?

274
00:20:16,355 --> 00:20:17,795
He apologized,

275
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,628
saying he felt guilty,

276
00:20:21,315 --> 00:20:22,555
and asked for another chance.

277
00:20:22,915 --> 00:20:23,867
What else?

278
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:26,539
He told us he was drunk that day,

279
00:20:27,595 --> 00:20:29,715
and that it was a one-time thing.

280
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:31,515
But he denied

281
00:20:31,995 --> 00:20:33,835
that he was the father of that child,

282
00:20:34,295 --> 00:20:35,995
so he will proceed with a paternity test.

283
00:20:36,572 --> 00:20:37,592
If it turns out

284
00:20:37,616 --> 00:20:39,572
that the baby is his,

285
00:20:40,655 --> 00:20:42,315
he will pay for child support.

286
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:43,502
But...

287
00:20:44,435 --> 00:20:46,115
he would like another chance

288
00:20:46,475 --> 00:20:47,666
to start over with you.

289
00:20:50,915 --> 00:20:51,995
He told us

290
00:20:52,715 --> 00:20:54,235
he really loved you, Prem.

291
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,915
Do you think he really loves me

292
00:20:57,355 --> 00:20:58,915
after what he did to me?

293
00:21:01,915 --> 00:21:03,828
I know you're emotional,

294
00:21:03,868 --> 00:21:07,469
but every single one of us
makes mistakes, dear.

295
00:21:08,395 --> 00:21:10,481
You must really want me to marry

296
00:21:10,488 --> 00:21:12,261
the man who cheated on me.

297
00:21:13,555 --> 00:21:15,675
Do I really have to
keep my head down, Father?

298
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:18,195
Why won't you try to understand anything?

299
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,715
Learn how to let go!

300
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,042
True, he made a mistake,

301
00:21:21,074 --> 00:21:23,282
but that was one time,
and he already feels bad.

302
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,112
Is that so hard for you to forgive?

303
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,035
Calm down, darling...

304
00:21:27,082 --> 00:21:28,922
I am as calm as can be!

305
00:21:28,947 --> 00:21:31,587
- But look at our stubborn daughter!
- I am not stubborn!

306
00:21:32,195 --> 00:21:33,435
I have my reasons.

307
00:21:33,995 --> 00:21:35,548
Even before we're married,

308
00:21:35,588 --> 00:21:37,788
he's made me cry
more than I ever imagined.

309
00:21:37,828 --> 00:21:40,195
Don't you guys think

310
00:21:40,235 --> 00:21:41,595
it would get even worse

311
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:44,155
if we actually got married?

312
00:21:44,195 --> 00:21:45,595
You're just being paranoid!

313
00:21:46,155 --> 00:21:48,275
Couldn't you just live in the moment?

314
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,875
I don't want you to shut yourself out.

315
00:21:50,915 --> 00:21:52,235
I want you to get married

316
00:21:52,275 --> 00:21:53,915
and build a family.

317
00:21:54,475 --> 00:21:56,035
I'm not ready right now.

318
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:58,275
Please excuse me.

319
00:21:59,475 --> 00:22:00,475
Prem!

320
00:22:02,595 --> 00:22:04,075
Let me talk to her.

321
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:04,780
Darling,

322
00:22:04,805 --> 00:22:07,045
you need to put her in her place!

323
00:22:11,395 --> 00:22:12,395
Prem!

324
00:22:12,755 --> 00:22:13,595
Prem!

325
00:22:13,635 --> 00:22:15,195
Wait for me!

326
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:17,628
Prem...

327
00:22:18,643 --> 00:22:20,603
Please don't be angry at your father.

328
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:22,715
He only said that

329
00:22:22,755 --> 00:22:24,235
because he cares so much about you.

330
00:22:24,515 --> 00:22:25,715
Besides,

331
00:22:25,995 --> 00:22:27,715
he really adores Thawat

332
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,340
and hates the thought of losing him.

333
00:22:29,855 --> 00:22:31,915
Am I not his daughter?

334
00:22:33,635 --> 00:22:36,275
Isn't he supposed to be on my side, Mother?

335
00:22:40,003 --> 00:22:41,683
This is how he always is;

336
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:44,215
he never understands me!

337
00:22:44,305 --> 00:22:46,254
He never does!

338
00:23:00,235 --> 00:23:01,235
Prem!

339
00:23:02,535 --> 00:23:03,535
Father!

340
00:23:07,276 --> 00:23:09,076
I passed the violin exam!

341
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:10,515
The teacher said

342
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,888
I have a chance

343
00:23:11,899 --> 00:23:14,715
at applying for
the University of Music in Vienna!

344
00:23:16,235 --> 00:23:17,115
No more of that.

345
00:23:17,675 --> 00:23:18,675
Darling,

346
00:23:19,235 --> 00:23:20,875
what are you doing?!

347
00:23:22,555 --> 00:23:24,955
Who said you could apply
to a music university?

348
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:26,155
Father!

349
00:23:26,395 --> 00:23:27,915
You will only apply for med school!

350
00:23:27,955 --> 00:23:29,915
Music is just a hobby,

351
00:23:29,955 --> 00:23:30,915
not a profession!

352
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,500
But I don't want to be a doctor!

353
00:23:33,555 --> 00:23:35,195
I want to play violin, Father.

354
00:23:35,235 --> 00:23:36,235
I won't allow it.

355
00:23:37,175 --> 00:23:39,275
You will only walk
the path I've paved for you!

356
00:23:41,195 --> 00:23:42,211
But...

357
00:23:42,315 --> 00:23:43,555
If you keep being difficult,

358
00:23:43,595 --> 00:23:44,808
I won't let you play it anymore!

359
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:47,245
Darling, you've gone too far!

360
00:23:48,475 --> 00:23:50,795
She's been strictly following
your education plan.

361
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,042
Just for once,

362
00:23:52,675 --> 00:23:54,355
why couldn't you give her what she wants?

363
00:23:54,395 --> 00:23:56,635
You have no rights in this matter.

364
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:58,988
As a mother, you're supposed
to raise a good daughter,

365
00:23:59,028 --> 00:24:00,955
so how come she's resistant to her father?!

366
00:24:00,995 --> 00:24:02,955
Please don't reprimand her, Father!

367
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,260
You'd better behave!

368
00:24:04,835 --> 00:24:06,035
Don't try to pick a fight with me!

369
00:24:11,915 --> 00:24:12,915
Dear...

370
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:17,259
All I want is to play violin, Mother...

371
00:24:50,315 --> 00:24:51,955
Thank you, Mother!

372
00:25:00,955 --> 00:25:02,835
I asked Father to give it back.

373
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,163
Play it when he's not around, alright?

374
00:25:08,315 --> 00:25:09,915
Thank you so much, Mother.

375
00:25:11,567 --> 00:25:14,195
You're the only one who understands me.

376
00:25:22,795 --> 00:25:24,795
I love you so, so much.

377
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,322
Happy Birthday, Mother.

378
00:26:02,195 --> 00:26:03,494
Thank you, dear.

379
00:26:06,475 --> 00:26:07,555
Make a wish.

380
00:26:14,675 --> 00:26:15,515
It won't go out!

381
00:26:15,555 --> 00:26:16,555
Let me help.

382
00:26:20,971 --> 00:26:22,171
This looks good!

383
00:26:23,955 --> 00:26:25,555
- Prem,
- Yes?

384
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,300
I also have something for you.

385
00:26:27,675 --> 00:26:29,435
Again, Mother?

386
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:31,635
Why do you always give me presents

387
00:26:31,784 --> 00:26:33,715
for your own birthday?

388
00:26:34,675 --> 00:26:36,427
Because you're such a good kid.

389
00:26:38,075 --> 00:26:38,575
Here.

390
00:26:39,383 --> 00:26:40,075
What is it?

391
00:26:42,348 --> 00:26:44,635
I know you've been asking
to go on a vacation.

392
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:46,635
Father already gave permission.

393
00:26:48,235 --> 00:26:49,515
Mother!

394
00:26:51,315 --> 00:26:52,115
Prem,

395
00:26:54,474 --> 00:26:56,714
I can give you the world, you know that?

396
00:27:02,415 --> 00:27:04,195
Thank you, Mother.

397
00:27:04,835 --> 00:27:06,315
Whatever you want,

398
00:27:06,555 --> 00:27:08,275
just say the word.

399
00:27:09,535 --> 00:27:12,097
I can also give you the world.

400
00:28:15,496 --> 00:28:16,296
Nam,

401
00:28:21,456 --> 00:28:22,316
here's for you to use.

402
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:25,376
Thank you, Thawat.

403
00:28:27,296 --> 00:28:28,296
Thawat,

404
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,136
are you leaving?

405
00:28:32,136 --> 00:28:32,835
Yeah.

406
00:28:32,991 --> 00:28:35,071
Can you not leave just yet?

407
00:28:35,436 --> 00:28:38,016
Let's find something delicious to eat.

408
00:28:38,776 --> 00:28:40,056
Please, Thawat?

409
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:42,456
My darling Thawat...

410
00:28:57,336 --> 00:29:00,975
[I love you, dear]

411
00:29:05,576 --> 00:29:07,176
He would like another chance

412
00:29:07,576 --> 00:29:08,776
to start over with you.

413
00:29:09,096 --> 00:29:10,306
He told us

414
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:11,994
he really loved you, Prem.

415
00:29:12,696 --> 00:29:14,056
True, he made a mistake,

416
00:29:14,096 --> 00:29:16,176
but that was one time,
and he already feels bad.

417
00:29:16,216 --> 00:29:18,336
Is that so hard for you to forgive?

418
00:29:18,376 --> 00:29:20,396
I don't want you to shut yourself out.

419
00:29:20,436 --> 00:29:21,776
I want you to get married

420
00:29:21,816 --> 00:29:23,336
and build a family.

421
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:26,576
Right, I do have some skills.

422
00:29:30,989 --> 00:29:31,809
Prem!

423
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,996
I can explain, Prem.

424
00:29:35,767 --> 00:29:37,607
I don't think that's necessary, Thawat.

425
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:40,896
I already saw

426
00:29:41,216 --> 00:29:42,336
what I needed to see.

427
00:29:44,687 --> 00:29:45,770
Are you not ashamed

428
00:29:45,794 --> 00:29:47,196
of lying to my parents like that?!

429
00:29:49,151 --> 00:29:50,431
Just hold on, Sweet Prem.

430
00:29:50,553 --> 00:29:52,953
It's not what it looks like.

431
00:29:53,302 --> 00:29:54,782
We're just friends,

432
00:29:56,116 --> 00:29:58,096
nothing more than that.

433
00:29:58,336 --> 00:30:00,380
Just stop with the excuses.

434
00:30:00,736 --> 00:30:02,696
I'm so sick of those!

435
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:05,936
I'll believe what I see.

436
00:30:07,416 --> 00:30:08,256
Thawat,

437
00:30:08,296 --> 00:30:09,856
can we go now?

438
00:30:09,998 --> 00:30:11,598
Just go if you can't wait!

439
00:30:12,976 --> 00:30:14,256
Look, Prem,

440
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,016
the only person I love is you,

441
00:30:19,856 --> 00:30:21,056
no one else.

442
00:30:24,136 --> 00:30:26,416
But as of right now,

443
00:30:27,356 --> 00:30:28,360
I'm not even sure

444
00:30:28,384 --> 00:30:29,856
if I've ever loved you.

445
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,313
Please stop bothering me

446
00:30:33,337 --> 00:30:35,136
and my parents.

447
00:30:38,656 --> 00:30:40,176
- Prem... Sweet Prem...
- Thawat!

448
00:30:40,216 --> 00:30:41,017
Thawat!

449
00:30:41,057 --> 00:30:42,497
Please just stay with me.

450
00:30:42,816 --> 00:30:43,816
Please, Thawat...

451
00:30:50,176 --> 00:30:51,576
I can explain, Prem.

452
00:30:52,536 --> 00:30:54,376
I don't think that's necessary, Thawat.

453
00:30:55,656 --> 00:30:56,688
I already saw

454
00:30:57,136 --> 00:30:58,296
what I needed to see.

455
00:30:58,896 --> 00:30:59,888
Are you not ashamed

456
00:30:59,912 --> 00:31:01,298
of lying to my parents like that?!

457
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:13,199
You saw the video?

458
00:31:13,856 --> 00:31:14,656
Mm...

459
00:31:14,936 --> 00:31:16,736
Poor thing, that doctor of yours.

460
00:31:17,016 --> 00:31:18,616
I wonder how she's doing now.

461
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,536
Are you that hurt?

462
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,376
You again?

463
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:14,296
Yes, it’s me again.

464
00:32:21,176 --> 00:32:22,616
Come on, let me help.

465
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:26,648
I don't need your help!

466
00:32:31,936 --> 00:32:33,456
Don't be so stubborn, Doc.

467
00:32:33,496 --> 00:32:34,656
I'll take you home.

468
00:32:35,896 --> 00:32:36,896
Let go...

469
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:40,216
Let go!

470
00:32:40,256 --> 00:32:41,376
Let go!!

471
00:33:01,336 --> 00:33:03,536
Do you love him that much, Doc?

472
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:07,096
You're all messed up.

473
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:08,896
"Love," you said?

474
00:33:10,336 --> 00:33:12,096
No, I'm enraged.

475
00:33:12,536 --> 00:33:15,256
I don't think I've ever loved
that fool to begin with!

476
00:33:15,896 --> 00:33:18,056
He ruined my life!

477
00:33:19,276 --> 00:33:21,096
It's completely falling apart.

478
00:33:22,495 --> 00:33:24,593
Your life is not ruined at all, Doc.

479
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,016
It is!

480
00:33:28,896 --> 00:33:31,176
I've got everything planned...

481
00:33:32,232 --> 00:33:34,152
I graduated with honors,

482
00:33:35,336 --> 00:33:37,936
and now working
at the best hospital there is...

483
00:33:39,296 --> 00:33:42,216
I was gonna marry the right one,

484
00:33:43,959 --> 00:33:46,950
but it didn't go
according to plan at all...

485
00:33:47,976 --> 00:33:49,056
If it didn't,

486
00:33:49,081 --> 00:33:51,044
then just make a new one.

487
00:33:52,456 --> 00:33:53,856
That's easy for you to say.

488
00:33:54,776 --> 00:33:55,776
Right now...

489
00:33:57,336 --> 00:34:00,816
Everyone is saying I'm a good-for-nothing

490
00:34:02,769 --> 00:34:05,022
and worthless!

491
00:34:06,576 --> 00:34:08,696
Is that truly what I am?

492
00:34:09,736 --> 00:34:10,966
Answer me!

493
00:34:10,991 --> 00:34:12,794
Is that truly what I am?

494
00:34:16,536 --> 00:34:21,056
♫All I can do is hold back tears,♫

495
00:34:21,096 --> 00:34:23,496
♫Knowing our last days are near♫

496
00:34:23,521 --> 00:34:25,601
Don't listen to any of the stuff they say.

497
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,616
It couldn't be more untrue.

498
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:32,216
You're the most valuable person ever.

499
00:34:34,776 --> 00:34:37,936
♫I need to face reality,♫

500
00:34:38,456 --> 00:34:43,976
♫Even though my heart weeps internally♫

501
00:34:44,016 --> 00:34:47,416
♫It's painful going against my heart♫

502
00:34:47,456 --> 00:34:50,856
♫It's painful that we have to part♫

503
00:34:50,896 --> 00:34:57,496
♫All I can say is a tearful goodbye♫

504
00:35:48,321 --> 00:35:49,881
How did I come back here?

505
00:35:54,416 --> 00:35:56,616
Don't listen to any of the stuff they say.

506
00:35:57,792 --> 00:35:59,552
It couldn't be more untrue.

507
00:36:01,416 --> 00:36:03,136
You're the most valuable person ever.

508
00:36:37,456 --> 00:36:39,936
Is my beautiful doctor awake by now?

509
00:36:41,882 --> 00:36:42,602
Pat!

510
00:36:45,216 --> 00:36:47,176
I've been calling since yesterday.

511
00:36:47,216 --> 00:36:49,151
Why didn't you pick up or even call back?

512
00:36:49,176 --> 00:36:50,016
I'm busy.

513
00:36:50,371 --> 00:36:51,371
With what?

514
00:36:51,816 --> 00:36:53,536
I don't think you need to know everything.

515
00:36:56,336 --> 00:36:57,536
And where are you going?

516
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,816
Didn't I just tell you a second ago?

517
00:37:01,816 --> 00:37:03,296
Why are you here, anyway?

518
00:37:03,776 --> 00:37:05,696
You have an event this afternoon.

519
00:37:06,695 --> 00:37:08,373
I already told you

520
00:37:08,398 --> 00:37:09,404
I'm not taking on the gig.

521
00:37:09,536 --> 00:37:11,016
But I already did;

522
00:37:11,056 --> 00:37:12,176
what do you expect me to do?

523
00:37:12,216 --> 00:37:13,696
Cancel it.

524
00:37:13,736 --> 00:37:15,896
- I can't do that.
- And why not?

525
00:37:15,921 --> 00:37:18,241
They already paid us.

526
00:37:18,696 --> 00:37:20,296
That seems like your problem, not mine.

527
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:21,615
Pat,

528
00:37:21,655 --> 00:37:23,696
I am your manager.

529
00:37:23,736 --> 00:37:26,416
Then, I'll consider you
not my manager anymore!

530
00:37:27,256 --> 00:37:27,976
Pat!

531
00:37:28,016 --> 00:37:30,216
You can't do this to me, Pat!

532
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:32,376
I can't take it anymore, Nam.

533
00:37:32,636 --> 00:37:34,161
I'm done with everything.

534
00:37:34,296 --> 00:37:35,616
You lied to me

535
00:37:35,656 --> 00:37:37,816
that Dr. Prem forgave that bastard,

536
00:37:38,336 --> 00:37:40,136
and you haven't even cut ties with him!

537
00:37:40,776 --> 00:37:42,176
I don't know

538
00:37:42,736 --> 00:37:44,296
what's true or not, Nam.

539
00:37:45,016 --> 00:37:47,456
Have you ever been sincere with me at all?

540
00:38:25,696 --> 00:38:27,256
How did you know the code to my place?

541
00:38:29,576 --> 00:38:31,296
You told me yourself,

542
00:38:32,296 --> 00:38:33,656
don't you remember?

543
00:38:43,256 --> 00:38:45,256
What's the password, Doc?

544
00:38:48,016 --> 00:38:50,696
2-2-5-6.

545
00:39:07,016 --> 00:39:08,296
Are you sick?

546
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:02,970
Doc, you're burning up!

547
00:40:03,717 --> 00:40:05,037
I'll take your temperature.

548
00:40:13,397 --> 00:40:14,287
Doc?

549
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,397
Doc?

550
00:40:21,237 --> 00:40:23,397
Doc...

551
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,780
Open your mouth.

552
00:40:29,957 --> 00:40:31,157
Doc?

553
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:34,557
Open your mouth.

554
00:40:37,901 --> 00:40:39,121
I can do it myself.

555
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,077
Whoa!

556
00:40:52,164 --> 00:40:53,884
You have a 38 °C fever!

557
00:40:55,717 --> 00:40:56,637
It's fine.

558
00:40:56,677 --> 00:40:58,037
I'll take a fever reducer.

559
00:40:58,537 --> 00:40:59,717
Let me find it for you.

560
00:41:02,037 --> 00:41:03,757
No, I can do it.

561
00:41:04,037 --> 00:41:05,437
Let me do it.

562
00:41:05,757 --> 00:41:07,317
I can find it myself.

563
00:41:07,957 --> 00:41:09,037
Doc,

564
00:41:09,437 --> 00:41:12,037
after spending almost all night together,

565
00:41:12,997 --> 00:41:14,877
you still don't trust me?

566
00:41:29,037 --> 00:41:38,757
♫No words needed to realize you're the one♫

567
00:41:38,797 --> 00:41:48,677
♫I was born to be the moon to your sun♫

568
00:41:49,277 --> 00:41:55,117
♫With you by my side,
there's nothing else I'd like♫

569
00:41:55,157 --> 00:41:56,157
Take the med.

570
00:42:01,237 --> 00:42:02,637
Or do I need to feed it to you?

571
00:42:03,997 --> 00:42:05,269
There's no need for that.

572
00:42:07,463 --> 00:42:13,111
♫The final answer to my prayers♫

573
00:42:16,477 --> 00:42:17,757
I'll put this away for you.

574
00:42:21,877 --> 00:42:27,637
♫Nothing compares
to the warmth of your embrace♫

575
00:42:29,997 --> 00:42:31,278
Let's go get some rest.

576
00:42:31,318 --> 00:42:32,358
I'll take care of you.

577
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,310
Let's go, Doc.

578
00:42:37,717 --> 00:42:40,557
♫The words I wish to express♫

579
00:42:41,097 --> 00:42:45,797
♫You're the love I'm longing for♫

580
00:42:45,837 --> 00:42:50,157
♫The heaven-sent one I adore♫

581
00:42:50,677 --> 00:42:56,517
♫The final answer to my prayers♫

582
00:42:59,357 --> 00:43:07,237
♫My heart will belong to you forever♫

583
00:43:20,069 --> 00:43:21,069
Please give me a minute.

584
00:45:23,797 --> 00:45:25,277
I'm sorry, Doc.

585
00:45:42,477 --> 00:45:43,557
Don't look.

586
00:46:09,597 --> 00:46:11,237
Can I cool your back down?

587
00:46:11,537 --> 00:46:13,277
I promise I won't look.

588
00:46:15,077 --> 00:46:16,077
♫All this time,♫

589
00:46:16,102 --> 00:46:16,676
Mm...

590
00:46:16,716 --> 00:46:20,092
♫I've never been graced with love♫

591
00:46:20,117 --> 00:46:24,848
♫Not a single love trap
I've been this fond of♫

592
00:46:25,109 --> 00:46:26,584
♫As I see you,♫

593
00:46:26,609 --> 00:46:31,557
♫An uncharted territory unravels,♫

594
00:46:31,996 --> 00:46:35,196
♫Too much for my heart to handle♫

595
00:46:35,677 --> 00:46:40,228
♫I see your face, though I'm sound asleep♫

596
00:46:41,657 --> 00:46:45,197
♫The more I miss you,
the worse my heart leaps♫

597
00:46:45,437 --> 00:46:51,397
♫Into unresolved puzzles that linger♫

598
00:46:51,677 --> 00:46:55,255
♫Do you feel the same, I wonder?♫

599
00:46:55,757 --> 00:46:59,966
♫Is this what you call love?♫

600
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:02,637
♫So this is love♫

601
00:47:02,677 --> 00:47:06,477
♫So this is love♫

602
00:47:06,717 --> 00:47:09,877

♫I've just realized
why everyone says it heals♫

613
00:47:50,088 --> 00:47:56,717

♫If I could turn back time,♫

632

Take a nap, Doc.

633
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:15,637
You'll be good as new after you wake up.

634
00:49:16,057 --> 00:49:23,677

Are you feeling better, Doc?

639
00:51:04,557 --> 00:51:05,244
I am.

640
00:51:07,817 --> 00:51:09,157
That's a relief.

641
00:51:09,489 --> 00:51:11,949
Your fever didn't go down until 10 P.M.

642
00:51:15,837 --> 00:51:17,077
Get more sleep.

643
00:51:17,397 --> 00:51:19,757
Are you letting me sleep over?

644
00:51:19,797 --> 00:51:21,037
Just for tonight.

645
00:51:22,177 --> 00:51:23,357
Who knows?

646
00:51:24,597 --> 00:51:27,013
There might be some other nights.

647
00:51:28,302 --> 00:51:29,313
There won't.

648
00:51:29,917 --> 00:51:31,165
If you'll excuse me,

649
00:51:31,267 --> 00:51:32,882
I need to go to work early tomorrow.

650
00:51:38,757 --> 00:51:40,317
Do you believe now

651
00:51:40,877 --> 00:51:42,277
that I'm genuinely into you

652
00:51:43,261 --> 00:51:44,887
and serious about asking you out.

653
00:51:51,318 --> 00:52:01,038

♫You're the love I'm longing for♫

657
00:52:25,357 --> 00:52:26,739
Is it even possible

658
00:52:26,837 --> 00:52:28,536
to go from hating each other

659
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:30,794
to falling completely in love?

660
00:52:31,497 --> 00:52:34,717
Love is unpredictable.

661
00:52:34,917 --> 00:52:35,942
Love is love.

662
00:52:36,201 --> 00:52:37,222
There's no reason

663
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,277
why you love someone.

664
00:52:38,444 --> 00:52:39,846
If you find the right person,

665
00:52:39,994 --> 00:52:40,978
your gut will tell you.

666
00:52:41,277 --> 00:52:43,076
Your heart's gonna beat like crazy.

667
00:52:43,101 --> 00:52:44,333
Have you been there?
