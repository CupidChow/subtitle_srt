1
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,200
What are you looking at, my love?

2
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,240
So I can't look at my girlfriend now?

3
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,820
I love it.

4
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,840
Come lie by my side.

5
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,160
I have a show picked out.

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,070
Let's see.

7
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,040
Which show?

8
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,320
Can you gimme a hug?

9
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,186
Prem.

10
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,120
Hm?

11
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,960
Who do you think the bad guy is

12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,920
between...

13
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,920
the man by the street

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,760
and that woman?

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,380
I think...

16
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,080
it's the man by the street.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,640
He looks strong enough to kill someone.

18
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,420
No,

19
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,040
I think it's the woman.

20
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:12,880
Hm?

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,720
Maybe it's more complicated than it seems.

22
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,680
Maybe the woman
works together with her secret lover

23
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,480
to kill her husband.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,240
Whoa!

25
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,000
Your eyebrows are tied into a bow now.

26
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,680
Do you like crime and investigation series?

27
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,360
I do.

28
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,000
My dad

29
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,200
was the one showing them to me,

30
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,040
so I really came to like them.

31
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,840
I think I'll have to get
to know my girlfriend more.

32
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,280
There seems to be something
even more interesting about you.

33
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,640
I love you.

34
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,840
Your hands are so soft.

35
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,920
And they smell so good.

36
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,800
Are doctors known to have soft hands?

37
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,480
I don't know.

38
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,680
I thought I took really good care of myself,

39
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,360
but after I met you,

40
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,800
I couldn't even compare.

41
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,320
Are you gonna watch the show or not?

42
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,880
I am!

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,720
I guess I have to change my lotion
to the one you use.

44
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,640
Really?

45
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,680
I'm sure I got the bad guy right.

46
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,602
The woman you asked me
to do a background check on

47
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,360
is Pat, Napak Tharanisorn,

48
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,280
a very famous actress of the hour.

49
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,240
An actress?

50
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,720
Yes, sir.

51
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,268
Is there anything else
you want me to look for?

52
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,040
How did this woman know my girlfriend?

53
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,440
[RAM2 Hospital]

54
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,040
Prem,

55
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,680
don't you normally avoid this type of food?

56
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,080
I saw you eat it,

57
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,600
so I thought I should try something new.

58
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,960
It seems mouthwatering.

59
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,480
But you don't
normally eat sour mangoes, do you?

60
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,360
I'm just craving something sour.

61
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,240
- "Craving"?!
- "Craving"?!

62
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,160
Tan,

63
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,720
help me get the food tray?

64
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,240
Sure.

65
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,280
Do you think what I'm thinking?

66
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,800
[Prem]

67
00:04:00,901 --> 00:04:02,680
Judging by how bad her craving is,

68
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,560
does this mean...

69
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Cut!

70
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,840
Alright, that's it.

71
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,480
That's a wrap for the set!

72
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,440
Someone help her, please.

73
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,080
Thank you, everyone.

74
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,680
Thank you so much!

75
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,640
You've worked so hard!

76
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,760
Can I take a selfie with all of you?

77
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,600
Sure, come on, guys.

78
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,360
Let's do this. Come on.

79
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,640
Three, two, one...

80
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,640
Yay!

81
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,080
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

82
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,120
I'm all done with work.

83
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,720
See you at home.

84
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,000
Pat,

85
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,120
do you want to celebrate with us?

86
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,520
I can't.

87
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,880
I have some errands to run.

88
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,800
Again, I'm sorry, Sai,

89
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,080
that I have to rush the process of filming.

90
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,920
It's all because of the scandal.

91
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,960
Hey, it's all good.

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,720
We know what the truth is.

93
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,520
We're on your side.

94
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,320
Thank you.

95
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,800
Let's work together again next time.

96
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,760
Sure.

97
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,700
Pat,

98
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,920
reporters are here to ask for an interview.

99
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,720
They want to know more
about how you bailed on the event

100
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,240
and how you have beef with your manager.

101
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:45,920
Pat!

102
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,360
Cherry, please tell them

103
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,040
I'm not open to an interview.

104
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,480
I'm gonna go change now.

105
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,960
Sure.

106
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,920
Pat!

107
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,800
Wait up, Pat!

108
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,960
Pat,

109
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,200
I want to talk.

110
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,600
I thought I made myself clear

111
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,240
the last time we met.

112
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,920
Why is it so easy for you to cut me off?

113
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,560
Does it mean you don't care
about me anymore?

114
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,280
Are you trying to make up with me

115
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,920
because that man dumped you again?

116
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,480
Pat,

117
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,760
you're an important person in my life.

118
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,600
Of course, I want to make up with you.

119
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,640
Is that so?

120
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,600
I think it's good
that we go our separate ways.

121
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,680
Why are you so eagerly pushing me away?

122
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,280
Is it that you're with someone,

123
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,840
and they stop you from meeting me?

124
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,440
No one's stopping me, Nam.

125
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,360
This is my decision.

126
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,200
Then, can't you just forgive me?

127
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,320
Let's go back to the way we were.

128
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,400
The doctor said
I shouldn't be too stressed out,

129
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,200
so if you don't care about me,

130
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,080
please do it for the sake of my baby,

131
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,880
your nibling.

132
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,840
Who said I'd take the baby as my nibling?

133
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,600
The child has a father, so that's his job.

134
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,960
If you don't want to be swarmed
by reporters,

135
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,960
take the back exit.

136
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,560
And don't come to my workplace again.

137
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,000
I miss you.

138
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,880
I miss you, too.

139
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,160
I have some good news for you.

140
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,880
What good news?

141
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,960
Tomorrow and the day after,

142
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,480
I can take two days off.

143
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,760
Should we go on a vacation?

144
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,600
Let's do it!

145
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,560
But...

146
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,200
are you free, Ms. Starlet?

147
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,520
I am.

148
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,840
From now on, all my free time

149
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,320
belongs to you.

150
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,120
Where should we go?

151
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,080
Let's go.

152
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,640
Go where?

153
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,160
We can decide later.

154
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,960
Let's just go.

155
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,800
Huh?

156
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,000
Where?

157
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,120
We haven't even had anything planned!

158
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,480
We don't need one.

159
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,400
We don't even need to bring our clothes!

160
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,760
Just buy new ones when we get there.

161
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,000
It's exciting that way!

162
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,120
Fine,

163
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
let's go on a vacation.

164
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,320
Do you like coming to the beach, Prem?

165
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,600
Well, it's beautiful

166
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,320
in every corner possible.

167
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,400
Even more so than me?

168
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,246
Are you trying to win a beach?

169
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,600
Alright,

170
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,720
you're prettier.

171
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,960
Good.

172
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,800
Considering how needy you are,

173
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,000
you were a spoiled girl, weren't you?

174
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,240
Is that why you're so spoiled now?

175
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,080
I'm only like this around you.

176
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,160
So that's the privilege I get?

177
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,800
Exactly.

178
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,160
If I'm not in love with someone,

179
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,380
I won't be stubborn with them.

180
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,200
Then...

181
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,280
get ready to be taught a lesson.

182
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,800
Do it!

183
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,200
Teach me tons!

184
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,920
Do it. I'm into it.

185
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,600
You're weird.

186
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,120
Are you still sleepy?

187
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,200
Do you want to take another nap?

188
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,080
No,

189
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,240
let's go shopping and check into our room!

190
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,560
You're a messy eater.

191
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,520
Let me clean it for you.

192
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,760
All clean.

193
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,840
Why are you pocketing your food?

194
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,640
You're all grown up, not a child.

195
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,680
Chew it slowly

196
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,720
and nicely,

197
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,320
or you'll choke.

198
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,880
Now, drink some water.

199
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,560
Good job.

200
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,480
Hey,

201
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,400
didn't I tell you not to pocket your food,

202
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,040
my naughty girl?

203
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
I'm not gonna be nice now.

204
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,440
Quick, chew your food!

205
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,360
Chew!

206
00:13:08,773 --> 00:13:10,120
Now!

207
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,440
Good job.

208
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,320
Be nice, okay?

209
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,800
I'll quit messing with you.

210
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,600
Do that again and I'll scold you.

211
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,000
Alright.

212
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,480
♫All this time,♫

213
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,696
♫I've never been graced with love♫

214
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,800
♫Not a single love trap
I've been this fond of♫

215
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,520
♫As I see you,♫

216
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,600
♫An uncharted territory unravels,♫

217
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,680
♫Too much for my heart to handle♫

218
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,800
♫I see your face, though I'm sound asleep♫

219
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,040
♫The more I miss you,
the worse my heart leaps♫

220
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:30,177
♫Into unresolved puzzles that linger♫

221
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,080
♫Do you feel the same, I wonder?♫

222
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,560
♫Is this what you call love?♫

223
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,360
♫So this is love♫

224
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,240
♫So this is love♫

225
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,800
♫It's just dawned on me what love is♫

♫So this is love♫

228

♫I've just realized

235
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:35,520

236

♫It's just dawned on me what love is♫

245
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,700
That's beautiful, Prem!

246
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,920
Why are you so talented?

247
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,080
You're a doctor,

248
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,600
a swimmer,

249
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,000
and also a musician!

250
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,120
That's too flattering.

251
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,200
It's not.

252
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,207
My girlfriend is the best!

253
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,360
Give me a sec, Pat.

254
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,760
[Mother]

255
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,440
Yes, Mother?

256
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,560
That's right.

257
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,080
Uh,

258
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,400
I forgot to tell you that

259
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,800
I couldn't make it today.

260
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,760
I...

261
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,680
I'm caught up in an urgent matter.

262
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:23,920
Right.

263
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,840
See you next week.

264
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,680
I love you, too.

265
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,120
Why didn't you tell her

266
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,600
you weren't caught up in an urgent matter

267
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,400
but a girlfriend?

268
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,980
Pat!

269
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,120
Just kidding!

270
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,200
Was that something urgent?

271
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,900
It was nothing.

272
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,920
I just forgot
I have dinner planned with my family today.

273
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,400
We do that every Friday.

274
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,880
Oh...

275
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,320
But the reason I didn't tell her
I was with you

276
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,240
is not that I wanted to hide it from them.

277
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,320
It's just that...

278
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,520
I have never been with a woman before.

279
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,520
I understand.

280
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,320
I wasn't gonna blame you for it.

281
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,280
We can go at your pace.

282
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,520
Tell your mother whenever you'd like.

283
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,000
Thank you for your understanding.

284
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,320
My mother is quite old-fashioned,

285
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,280
but she really does love me.

286
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,500
She can give me the world.

287
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,240
Even this violin.

288
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,520
If it wasn't for her,

289
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,960
I wouldn't be able to play it.

290
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,920
You really, really love your mother,
don't you?

291
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,160
Yes.

292
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,120
That's perfect.

293
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,920
I love a family-oriented person

294
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,920
since I also love my parents deeply.

295
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,840
Papa and Mama really like you.

296
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,400
They're dying to make you
their daughter-in-law.

297
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,040
Really?

298
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,480
Really,

299
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,840
no joke.

300
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,160
Alright, then.

301
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,360
You can take me to meet them.

302
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,720
Though,

303
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,520
you need to go somewhere with me.

304
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,040
I have a surprise for you.

305
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:16,588
Do you like it?

306
00:20:18,048 --> 00:20:19,308
I love it!

307
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:20,468
I couldn't be more in love!

308
00:20:23,868 --> 00:20:25,228
What a relief.

309
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,988
I thought this was gonna be too outdated.

310
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:30,108
Not at all.

311
00:20:31,268 --> 00:20:32,628
I really love it.

312
00:20:33,248 --> 00:20:34,988
This is so romantic!

313
00:20:36,748 --> 00:20:38,268
I'm glad you like it.

314
00:21:02,508 --> 00:21:12,068
♫No words needed to realize you're the one♫

315
00:21:12,108 --> 00:21:22,068
♫I was born to be the moon to your sun♫

316
00:21:22,588 --> 00:21:30,028
♫With you by my side,
there's nothing else I'd like♫

317
00:21:31,141 --> 00:21:36,028
♫You're the love I'm longing for♫

318
00:21:36,068 --> 00:21:40,785
♫The heaven-sent one I adore♫

319
00:21:44,228 --> 00:21:45,308
Prem.

320
00:21:45,468 --> 00:21:46,188
Hm?

321
00:21:46,828 --> 00:21:49,068
I have a gift for you.

322
00:21:49,528 --> 00:21:50,728
What gift?

323
00:21:55,308 --> 00:22:04,988
♫Nothing compares
to the warmth of your embrace♫

324
00:22:12,188 --> 00:22:13,788
Open it.

325
00:22:14,428 --> 00:22:19,188
♫You're the love I'm longing for♫

326
00:22:19,228 --> 00:22:23,548
♫The heaven-sent one I adore♫

327
00:22:23,988 --> 00:22:25,708
This is adorable!

328
00:22:25,748 --> 00:22:29,148
Do you know why I gave you this dollhouse?

329
00:22:31,608 --> 00:22:34,628
It's because I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

330
00:22:41,428 --> 00:22:42,788
Thank you, Pat.

331
00:22:43,348 --> 00:22:44,860
I really love it.

332
00:22:46,028 --> 00:22:48,133
I'm happy that you do.

333
00:22:51,468 --> 00:22:52,748
But...

334
00:22:53,808 --> 00:22:55,628
seeing how you went all out like this,

335
00:22:56,368 --> 00:22:57,748
will it even be a competition?

336
00:22:58,388 --> 00:22:59,508
Will what be?

337
00:23:02,288 --> 00:23:03,268
Are you saying...

338
00:23:03,308 --> 00:23:05,388
I also have a gift for you.

339
00:23:07,228 --> 00:23:13,028
♫The final answer to my prayers♫

340
00:23:14,428 --> 00:23:16,428
Are you proposing?!

341
00:23:18,108 --> 00:23:19,348
Calm down.

342
00:23:19,628 --> 00:23:20,628
Open your gift first.

343
00:23:21,508 --> 00:23:26,228
♫So long as you're willing to be♫

344
00:23:26,268 --> 00:23:32,548
♫The final answer to my prayers♫

345
00:23:33,588 --> 00:23:35,588
These are heart-shaped,
just like your pendant!

346
00:23:38,388 --> 00:23:39,228
Exactly,

347
00:23:41,268 --> 00:23:42,828
I gave you my heart,

348
00:23:43,988 --> 00:23:45,788
so we can match.

349
00:23:47,228 --> 00:23:48,428
I'll put them on for you.

350
00:24:59,268 --> 00:25:00,628
Why are you crying?

351
00:25:02,548 --> 00:25:04,348
Don't you like them?

352
00:25:08,828 --> 00:25:10,308
I'm just so happy.

353
00:25:12,188 --> 00:25:13,908
Three or four days ago,

354
00:25:13,948 --> 00:25:16,668
I thought I was gonna get
my heart broken for you.

355
00:25:34,888 --> 00:25:37,028
Now, you're my girlfriend,

356
00:25:38,108 --> 00:25:40,548
and you're even doing
something romantic for me.

357
00:25:51,988 --> 00:25:53,348
Don't cry, Pat.

358
00:25:56,608 --> 00:25:58,108
Over the years,

359
00:25:58,148 --> 00:26:00,868
I've never had any luck in love, Prem.

360
00:26:01,528 --> 00:26:03,828
Those I loved never loved me back.

361
00:26:06,508 --> 00:26:09,908
You're now my one and only, Prem.

362
00:26:15,588 --> 00:26:17,748
You're also my one and only, Pat.

363
00:26:19,188 --> 00:26:21,228
You're even my first love.

364
00:26:24,668 --> 00:26:28,028
Even if I had to cry hundreds of times more
because of that awful man

365
00:26:28,068 --> 00:26:29,388
just to eventually meet you,

366
00:26:31,188 --> 00:26:32,188
I'd happily do it.

367
00:26:35,868 --> 00:26:37,188
Thank you

368
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:41,828
for making me realize
how exceptional love can be.

369
00:27:34,788 --> 00:27:35,788
Morning, Pat.

370
00:27:42,068 --> 00:27:43,588
Are you laughing at my face?

371
00:27:43,948 --> 00:27:45,108
No,

372
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:47,988
I'm just thinking
about how adorable you are.

373
00:27:49,148 --> 00:27:52,308
Who knew you liked matching items?

374
00:27:55,608 --> 00:27:57,108
Don't you like it?

375
00:27:58,748 --> 00:28:00,588
Whatever you like

376
00:28:00,868 --> 00:28:02,428
is what I'm into.

377
00:28:11,528 --> 00:28:13,308
I don't want to get up.

378
00:28:13,948 --> 00:28:15,188
But it's time to.

379
00:28:16,068 --> 00:28:17,828
Come on, let's take a shower.

380
00:28:18,228 --> 00:28:19,988
We need to leave in the afternoon.

381
00:28:21,268 --> 00:28:23,508
But I don't want to.

382
00:28:24,868 --> 00:28:26,508
I'll take you here again sometime.

383
00:28:31,008 --> 00:28:31,868
Really?

384
00:28:33,308 --> 00:28:34,228
Mm.

385
00:28:35,468 --> 00:28:36,568
Fine, I'll get up.

386
00:28:38,188 --> 00:28:40,388
But you'll have to take me to the bathroom.

387
00:28:41,008 --> 00:28:42,428
I'm too lazy to even move a leg.

388
00:28:45,468 --> 00:28:47,268
What a cunning one.

389
00:29:12,428 --> 00:29:15,108
Come on, let's take a shower.

390
00:29:17,308 --> 00:29:19,188
Take off my clothes, please?

391
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:33,428
♫No words needed to realize you're the one♫

392
00:29:33,468 --> 00:29:43,828
♫I was born to be the moon to your sun♫

393
00:29:43,868 --> 00:29:52,148
♫With you by my side,
there's nothing else I'd like♫

394
00:29:52,568 --> 00:29:57,428
♫You're the love I'm longing for♫

395
00:29:57,468 --> 00:30:01,984
♫The heaven-sent one I adore♫

396
00:30:02,228 --> 00:30:08,548
♫The final answer to my prayers♫

397
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:21,108
♫My heart will belong to you forever♫

398
00:30:33,948 --> 00:30:35,268
She's your friend, isn't she?

399
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:40,068
Isn't that your ex?

400
00:30:40,108 --> 00:30:41,508
Don't act so innocent.

401
00:30:42,788 --> 00:30:45,308
You told your little friend
to mess with her head, didn't you?

402
00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:48,228
That doctor is the one messing with my head!

403
00:30:48,268 --> 00:30:49,668
Watch your mouth.

404
00:30:50,268 --> 00:30:51,468
I hate that witch.

405
00:30:52,188 --> 00:30:53,388
She took you from me,

406
00:30:53,428 --> 00:30:54,628
and now Pat!

407
00:30:54,668 --> 00:30:55,668
Unbelievable...

408
00:30:56,828 --> 00:30:58,868
- You're disgusting!
- Ow!

409
00:30:58,908 --> 00:31:00,708
I can't deal with you anymore!

410
00:31:01,148 --> 00:31:02,948
I can't with you either!

411
00:31:04,068 --> 00:31:06,228
Be my guest and go back to that woman;

412
00:31:06,268 --> 00:31:07,348
I'll go back to Pat!

413
00:31:07,388 --> 00:31:08,748
You're a douchebag!

414
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:09,668
Bastard!

415
00:31:09,828 --> 00:31:11,508
Get out of my house, now!!

416
00:31:11,548 --> 00:31:13,388
- Get the hell out!
- Damn it!

417
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:15,548
Ow...

418
00:32:18,708 --> 00:32:21,268
[Nam]

419
00:32:25,308 --> 00:32:26,628
Is Nam...

420
00:32:27,268 --> 00:32:28,788
that friend of yours?

421
00:32:34,168 --> 00:32:35,668
Why don't you pick up her call?

422
00:32:41,988 --> 00:32:43,228
I don't want to.

423
00:32:43,688 --> 00:32:45,348
I want this to be our time.

424
00:32:47,848 --> 00:32:48,848
Just take it

425
00:32:49,688 --> 00:32:51,068
in case something happens.

426
00:33:02,588 --> 00:33:03,508
Hello?

427
00:33:04,068 --> 00:33:04,868
Pat...

428
00:33:05,588 --> 00:33:06,395
Blood...

429
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:08,708
There's blood everywhere...

430
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:12,268
Please help me and my baby, Pat...

431
00:33:12,968 --> 00:33:14,268
I have no one left...

432
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:16,508
Nam!

433
00:33:16,988 --> 00:33:18,068
Just hold on.

434
00:33:18,108 --> 00:33:19,468
I'll be there as soon as possible!

435
00:33:19,768 --> 00:33:20,908
Stay calm, Nam,

436
00:33:21,028 --> 00:33:22,268
and don't hang up.

437
00:33:23,688 --> 00:33:24,468
Prem,

438
00:33:24,508 --> 00:33:26,828
can you call an ambulance for me?

439
00:33:28,508 --> 00:33:29,508
Hey, Nam.

440
00:33:29,548 --> 00:33:30,468
Are you still there?

441
00:33:33,268 --> 00:33:34,348
Hello, Nam?!

442
00:34:07,616 --> 00:34:08,496
Pat...

443
00:34:11,376 --> 00:34:12,256
My baby...

444
00:34:15,696 --> 00:34:16,940
What about my baby?

445
00:34:20,736 --> 00:34:21,714
My baby...

446
00:34:25,376 --> 00:34:26,976
What about my baby?

447
00:34:27,696 --> 00:34:29,656
What happened to my baby, Pat?

448
00:34:30,216 --> 00:34:32,016
My baby?

449
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:34,416
What about my baby...

450
00:34:34,704 --> 00:34:35,976
It's gonna be alright, Nam.

451
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,376
I have no one left, Pat...

452
00:34:44,536 --> 00:34:45,536
Pat,

453
00:34:45,816 --> 00:34:47,456
please don't leave me.

454
00:34:50,976 --> 00:34:53,136
Please don't go anywhere.

455
00:34:54,616 --> 00:34:57,481
Please don't leave me, Pat...

456
00:34:58,976 --> 00:35:00,376
Please...

457
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:08,376
I have no one left...

458
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:29,296
Prem!

459
00:35:29,996 --> 00:35:30,996
What are you doing here?

460
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:33,296
Isn't this your day off?

461
00:35:34,656 --> 00:35:37,136
Just dealing with some business.

462
00:35:39,426 --> 00:35:40,339
Come sit.

463
00:35:46,136 --> 00:35:47,136
Sit down.

464
00:35:52,036 --> 00:35:52,936
Prem,

465
00:35:53,436 --> 00:35:55,336
can I ask you something?

466
00:35:57,096 --> 00:35:58,256
Have you...

467
00:36:01,136 --> 00:36:02,136
started your prenatal care?

468
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,976
Huh?

469
00:36:03,976 --> 00:36:04,976
Prenatal care?

470
00:36:07,136 --> 00:36:08,576
I know you're pregnant,

471
00:36:08,816 --> 00:36:10,136
but you don't have to be worried.

472
00:36:11,176 --> 00:36:12,536
We've thought this through.

473
00:36:12,756 --> 00:36:13,756
Thought what through?

474
00:36:16,896 --> 00:36:18,016
Prem, let's get married.

475
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:21,096
I'll be the father of your child.

476
00:36:21,656 --> 00:36:22,937
Your baby

477
00:36:22,977 --> 00:36:24,856
will legally have a father,

478
00:36:24,896 --> 00:36:27,176
and you don't have
to give any answers to the public.

479
00:36:27,336 --> 00:36:29,016
We'll help you raise your baby.

480
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,296
Don't you worry.

481
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,576
We'll work it out together.

482
00:36:33,236 --> 00:36:34,776
Wait, wait, wait.

483
00:36:36,096 --> 00:36:38,136
You got it all wrong.

484
00:36:38,976 --> 00:36:40,376
I'm not pregnant!

485
00:36:43,336 --> 00:36:44,736
No need to be embarrassed around us.

486
00:36:46,576 --> 00:36:47,896
I'm not embarrassed.

487
00:36:48,616 --> 00:36:50,656
I'm just genuinely not pregnant!

488
00:36:52,036 --> 00:36:52,816
What?

489
00:36:53,216 --> 00:36:54,976
But you slipped up that night, didn't you?

490
00:36:57,416 --> 00:36:58,576
Bow, Tan,

491
00:37:01,576 --> 00:37:02,696
that night...

492
00:37:04,696 --> 00:37:06,416
I slept with a woman,

493
00:37:06,456 --> 00:37:07,776
not a man!

494
00:37:23,536 --> 00:37:24,776
Let's have this talk later.

495
00:37:40,496 --> 00:37:42,496
Have you figured out
why your friend miscarried?

496
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:45,416
Because of that man.

497
00:37:46,036 --> 00:37:46,936
They got into a fight,

498
00:37:46,976 --> 00:37:48,936
and he pushed her into a stair railing.

499
00:37:49,936 --> 00:37:51,656
Thawat did that?

500
00:37:54,776 --> 00:37:55,776
Well...

501
00:37:56,596 --> 00:37:57,816
is your friend alright?

502
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:00,176
She's the opposite of that.

503
00:38:12,336 --> 00:38:13,336
Prem,

504
00:38:15,836 --> 00:38:18,136
there's something about her
that I need to tell you.

505
00:38:20,896 --> 00:38:22,736
I want to make things clear

506
00:38:22,776 --> 00:38:24,376
so that there's nothing to hide between us.

507
00:38:27,256 --> 00:38:28,336
What is it?

508
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:32,456
I liked Nam more than a friend,

509
00:38:35,216 --> 00:38:36,976
but it's all in the past now.

510
00:38:38,096 --> 00:38:39,256
You were together?

511
00:38:40,136 --> 00:38:41,136
No,

512
00:38:42,796 --> 00:38:44,696
it was one-sided.

513
00:38:45,976 --> 00:38:48,016
I don't have any feelings for her anymore.

514
00:38:48,696 --> 00:38:50,456
You're the only one I love.

515
00:38:51,096 --> 00:38:51,816
So...

516
00:38:52,736 --> 00:38:55,016
what are you trying to tell me?

517
00:38:55,816 --> 00:38:57,376
Nam has no one by her side,

518
00:38:58,576 --> 00:39:00,936
so I'll have to take care of her
for the time being.

519
00:39:02,016 --> 00:39:03,776
Please don't be mad at me.

520
00:39:06,696 --> 00:39:08,296
Why would I be?

521
00:39:09,196 --> 00:39:11,296
It could make you uncomfortable...

522
00:39:14,216 --> 00:39:15,376
I'm fine.

523
00:39:17,196 --> 00:39:19,456
You gotta help your friend
through a tough time.

524
00:39:22,896 --> 00:39:24,896
[Nam]

525
00:39:27,296 --> 00:39:28,616
Just go to your friend, Pat.

526
00:39:30,536 --> 00:39:31,856
I'm gonna leave now.

527
00:39:31,896 --> 00:39:32,976
But...

528
00:39:33,016 --> 00:39:34,016
Just go.

529
00:39:36,296 --> 00:39:37,656
She's blowing up your phone now.

530
00:39:39,096 --> 00:39:40,736
Let me walk you.

531
00:39:41,656 --> 00:39:43,176
I can walk by myself.

532
00:39:45,136 --> 00:39:47,936
I'm not a weak woman who can't be alone.

533
00:40:39,296 --> 00:40:41,576
I really, really miss you.

534
00:40:41,616 --> 00:40:42,946
I want your hug.

535
00:40:52,376 --> 00:40:54,536
I liked Nam more than a friend,

536
00:40:55,936 --> 00:40:57,696
but it's all in the past now.

537
00:41:05,976 --> 00:41:09,376
[RAM2 Hospital]

538
00:41:44,036 --> 00:41:44,856
Hey,

539
00:41:45,256 --> 00:41:47,176
do you really think
I hid a whole person in here?

540
00:41:48,016 --> 00:41:49,336
The most dangerous place...

541
00:41:49,376 --> 00:41:50,936
is usually the safest place.

542
00:41:54,036 --> 00:41:55,416
Shoot your questions.

543
00:41:57,316 --> 00:41:59,416
I can't believe you did it with a woman!

544
00:42:00,296 --> 00:42:01,216
Prem,

545
00:42:01,256 --> 00:42:02,656
you've never been with a woman,

546
00:42:02,956 --> 00:42:04,976
and you're very careful with your actions,

547
00:42:06,756 --> 00:42:07,976
so what exactly happened?

548
00:42:09,056 --> 00:42:10,976
Do you think I was joking?

549
00:42:11,436 --> 00:42:12,256
No,

550
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:13,736
but there must be a reason

551
00:42:13,776 --> 00:42:15,616
you decided to do it, right?

552
00:42:21,736 --> 00:42:22,936
This time...

553
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:25,536
there was no reason for it.

554
00:42:27,256 --> 00:42:28,696
That's out of character!

555
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:31,136
And what's going on now between you

556
00:42:31,176 --> 00:42:32,176
and that woman?

557
00:42:36,356 --> 00:42:37,536
Well...

558
00:42:40,296 --> 00:42:41,376
we're together now.

559
00:42:43,336 --> 00:42:44,216
Prem!

560
00:42:45,936 --> 00:42:47,216
Please tell us

561
00:42:47,536 --> 00:42:49,336
who the lucky lady is!

562
00:42:50,016 --> 00:42:51,536
You'll see.

563
00:42:54,816 --> 00:42:55,576
Hey...

564
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:56,816
How did you get in?!

565
00:42:56,856 --> 00:42:58,136
What are you going to do to my friend?

566
00:43:00,576 --> 00:43:03,216
This is not a place
to look for your friend's partner.

567
00:43:08,936 --> 00:43:10,736
I'm really sorry,

568
00:43:11,976 --> 00:43:13,536
you two,

569
00:43:13,576 --> 00:43:14,976
that I made you upset.

570
00:43:21,196 --> 00:43:23,216
But Prem and I

571
00:43:23,416 --> 00:43:24,696
are girlfriends now.

572
00:43:30,216 --> 00:43:31,896
I can explain.

573
00:43:33,296 --> 00:43:35,176
Then, meet us at the cafeteria at lunch!

574
00:43:35,576 --> 00:43:36,296
Mm!

575
00:43:46,736 --> 00:43:48,256
Are you okay, Prem?

576
00:43:49,576 --> 00:43:50,576
I am.

577
00:43:51,216 --> 00:43:52,936
I was planning to tell them anyway.

578
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:57,936
I really miss you, Prem.

579
00:43:58,216 --> 00:43:59,936
Do you miss me?

580
00:44:01,216 --> 00:44:02,216
Well,

581
00:44:02,856 --> 00:44:04,016
a little.

582
00:44:05,216 --> 00:44:06,216
Ow,

583
00:44:07,016 --> 00:44:08,016
why was that?

584
00:44:10,736 --> 00:44:12,296
Just kidding!

585
00:44:14,176 --> 00:44:15,936
Have you had your breakfast?

586
00:44:16,096 --> 00:44:17,176
Already.

587
00:44:18,016 --> 00:44:18,896
Right,

588
00:44:19,216 --> 00:44:20,936
I bought a sandwich for you.

589
00:44:29,616 --> 00:44:30,736
You're the best!

590
00:44:36,056 --> 00:44:37,056
Last night,

591
00:44:38,196 --> 00:44:40,676
you didn't...

592
00:44:42,416 --> 00:44:44,576
cry yourself to bed
because you missed me, did you?

593
00:44:45,776 --> 00:44:47,536
Who'd do that?

594
00:44:48,456 --> 00:44:49,556
No clue.

595
00:44:54,376 --> 00:44:55,976
You didn't get to sleep much, Pat?

596
00:44:58,096 --> 00:45:01,176
Why do you look so cheerless?

597
00:45:05,696 --> 00:45:07,776
I didn't get to sleep until 2 A.M.

598
00:45:10,976 --> 00:45:12,416
Is she doing better?

599
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:16,656
She is,

600
00:45:17,376 --> 00:45:19,056
but she's still grieving.

601
00:45:19,096 --> 00:45:21,216
She gets frantic every time I'm not around.

602
00:45:24,016 --> 00:45:25,616
Wouldn't she be mad

603
00:45:26,016 --> 00:45:27,136
that you came down here?

604
00:45:28,536 --> 00:45:29,976
Let her.

605
00:45:30,196 --> 00:45:31,536
I'm not a prisoner,

606
00:45:31,796 --> 00:45:33,896
so why would I be with her all the time?

607
00:45:41,156 --> 00:45:42,776
I have a girlfriend now.

608
00:45:44,516 --> 00:45:46,256
I gotta be with my girlfriend, right?

609
00:45:50,976 --> 00:45:53,416
Then, today,

610
00:45:53,456 --> 00:45:55,256
if you have time,

611
00:45:55,936 --> 00:45:57,816
let's have lunch with my friends.

612
00:46:27,764 --> 00:46:29,644
You know about Prem and that woman, Sita?

613
00:46:30,924 --> 00:46:31,724
I do.

614
00:46:32,044 --> 00:46:33,444
Then, why didn't you say something,

615
00:46:33,484 --> 00:46:35,044
leaving me worried for so long?

616
00:46:35,684 --> 00:46:38,444
Because Prem asked me
not to tell you and Tan.

617
00:46:38,924 --> 00:46:40,644
You should've let me in on it anyway.

618
00:46:42,604 --> 00:46:43,924
Bow, are you mad at me?

619
00:46:44,924 --> 00:46:45,924
A little.

620
00:46:46,564 --> 00:46:47,644
Well...

621
00:46:47,684 --> 00:46:49,764
how should I make it up to you?

622
00:46:51,204 --> 00:46:52,764
Tonight...

623
00:46:52,804 --> 00:46:54,684
should I spend another night at your place?

624
00:46:57,204 --> 00:46:58,404
That's so unfair.

625
00:46:59,324 --> 00:47:00,244
How so?

626
00:47:00,797 --> 00:47:03,797
How could I ever stay mad
at someone as pretty as you?

627
00:47:06,644 --> 00:47:08,444
If you're not mad at me anymore,

628
00:47:09,084 --> 00:47:11,164
then you have to behave

629
00:47:11,384 --> 00:47:13,044
while we meet with Prem's girlfriend,

630
00:47:13,444 --> 00:47:14,444
alright?

631
00:47:28,044 --> 00:47:29,964
I don't know exactly what happened,

632
00:47:30,164 --> 00:47:33,084
but we respect your decision, Prem.

633
00:47:33,124 --> 00:47:34,124
That's right.

634
00:47:34,324 --> 00:47:36,884
But if you ever make her sad...

635
00:47:39,804 --> 00:47:41,764
If that ever happens,

636
00:47:42,364 --> 00:47:44,284
you guys can gang up on me.

637
00:47:53,684 --> 00:47:55,364
Cut the act!

638
00:47:55,964 --> 00:47:57,364
You're scaring Pat.

639
00:48:00,404 --> 00:48:02,044
Thank you, Sita.

640
00:48:03,524 --> 00:48:04,604
Let's eat.

641
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:15,364
You made this, Pat?

642
00:48:15,524 --> 00:48:16,404
I did.

643
00:48:31,224 --> 00:48:32,124
Pat,

644
00:48:34,644 --> 00:48:36,244
there you go, pocketing your food again.

645
00:48:37,684 --> 00:48:38,684
Chew!

646
00:48:39,444 --> 00:48:40,564
Quick, chew it.

647
00:48:42,724 --> 00:48:43,724
Great job.

648
00:48:46,484 --> 00:48:47,404
Bow,

649
00:48:47,804 --> 00:48:49,364
there you go, pocketing your food again.

650
00:48:49,404 --> 00:48:50,404
Quick, chew it.

651
00:48:55,204 --> 00:48:56,224
Tan,

652
00:48:56,444 --> 00:48:57,724
that's my job.

653
00:49:00,444 --> 00:49:01,964
Big bite!

654
00:49:02,964 --> 00:49:04,524
So, Tan, you're still single?

655
00:49:23,484 --> 00:49:25,284
I appreciate you, Prem,

656
00:49:25,324 --> 00:49:27,204
for introducing me to your friends.

657
00:49:28,544 --> 00:49:30,084
It's alright.

658
00:49:30,444 --> 00:49:31,444
Nothing unusual.

659
00:49:31,884 --> 00:49:33,604
It might be for you,

660
00:49:33,644 --> 00:49:35,924
but it means the world to me.

661
00:49:39,564 --> 00:49:41,604
Now, go back up there.

662
00:49:42,484 --> 00:49:43,844
Your friend must be waiting.

663
00:49:46,604 --> 00:49:48,324
I'll come back down here again.

664
00:49:48,964 --> 00:49:50,391
It's fine.

665
00:49:51,884 --> 00:49:53,484
Didn’t you say

666
00:49:53,764 --> 00:49:55,564
that if you disappeared,

667
00:49:55,604 --> 00:49:57,084
she'd get frantic?

668
00:50:01,004 --> 00:50:02,164
Then...

669
00:50:02,484 --> 00:50:04,444
wait for me after work,

670
00:50:04,484 --> 00:50:05,924
so we can go home together.

671
00:50:06,284 --> 00:50:08,804
Just sort things out with your friend first.

672
00:50:12,164 --> 00:50:13,484
I told you,

673
00:50:13,804 --> 00:50:16,764
I'm not a weak woman who can't be alone.

674
00:50:18,984 --> 00:50:21,884
But I want you to be lost without me.

675
00:50:23,924 --> 00:50:24,924
You're so extra.

676
00:50:27,004 --> 00:50:28,244
Now, go!

677
00:50:28,764 --> 00:50:31,004
I have to go back to the patients, too.

678
00:50:31,644 --> 00:50:36,324
♫You make my heart flutter♫

679
00:50:36,364 --> 00:50:40,964
♫You make me melt
every time you lean closer♫

680
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:45,515
♫Your gaze makes me lose my mind♫

681
00:50:45,724 --> 00:50:50,644
♫You're the only one I want by my side♫

682
00:50:53,284 --> 00:50:54,484
Where were you?

683
00:50:58,564 --> 00:50:59,844
It's personal.

684
00:51:00,264 --> 00:51:01,224
Why?

685
00:51:01,264 --> 00:51:03,724
So I don't get to be
in your personal life anymore?

686
00:51:04,404 --> 00:51:05,764
I'm that bad a person?

687
00:51:05,924 --> 00:51:07,844
I'm the worst there is, aren't I?

688
00:51:08,844 --> 00:51:10,924
That's not what I meant.

689
00:51:12,604 --> 00:51:14,324
Or do you hate me now?

690
00:51:15,724 --> 00:51:16,644
I don't.

691
00:51:16,804 --> 00:51:19,124
Then, don't leave me here by myself!

692
00:51:19,444 --> 00:51:20,724
I'm scared.

693
00:51:26,564 --> 00:51:28,244
No one's gonna hurt you.

694
00:51:28,884 --> 00:51:29,884
Yes, they are.

695
00:51:29,924 --> 00:51:30,924
While you were away,

696
00:51:30,964 --> 00:51:32,964
that was when Thawat came in and hurt me.

697
00:51:33,184 --> 00:51:34,724
Don't leave me, Pat.

698
00:51:35,124 --> 00:51:36,884
I have no one left.

699
00:51:38,444 --> 00:51:39,924
Don't say that, Nam.

700
00:51:40,524 --> 00:51:42,284
You still have your parents

701
00:51:42,744 --> 00:51:44,724
and your family.

702
00:51:45,364 --> 00:51:46,364
You know full well

703
00:51:46,404 --> 00:51:48,804
how my family back home is.

704
00:51:51,764 --> 00:51:54,324
And does that man know
he made you like this?

705
00:51:54,884 --> 00:51:56,978
You should really have
a serious talk with him.

706
00:51:57,444 --> 00:51:58,844
It's no use, Pat.

707
00:51:58,884 --> 00:52:01,204
He's probably happy
that I had a miscarriage.

708
00:52:01,564 --> 00:52:03,484
I don't need him anymore

709
00:52:03,924 --> 00:52:05,444
as long as I have you,

710
00:52:05,804 --> 00:52:07,204
only you.

711
00:52:08,164 --> 00:52:09,804
Pat, promise

712
00:52:09,944 --> 00:52:11,484
you won't leave me.

713
00:52:12,924 --> 00:52:14,484
Promise me,

714
00:52:14,524 --> 00:52:15,404
please.

715
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,924
Please, Pat. Promise me...

716
00:52:25,124 --> 00:52:26,124
I promise.

717
00:53:58,021 --> 00:53:59,284
Sorry,

718
00:53:59,324 --> 00:54:02,444
the number you've dialed
cannot be reached at this moment.

719
00:54:57,084 --> 00:54:57,964
Doctor!
