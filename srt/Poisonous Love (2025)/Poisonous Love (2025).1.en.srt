1
00:01:41,544 --> 00:01:42,544
A woman

2
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:45,904
who was once the poison in my veins...

3
00:01:57,164 --> 00:01:58,624
turns into the love

4
00:01:59,564 --> 00:02:02,264
that my heart could never beat without.

5
00:02:49,864 --> 00:02:52,064
Seems like you didn't learn from last time.

6
00:02:52,224 --> 00:02:54,934
If you ever think about
using your power against me,

7
00:02:55,204 --> 00:02:56,664
just know it's not gonna work.

8
00:02:57,024 --> 00:02:59,944
I'll expose all your dirty little habits.

9
00:03:00,144 --> 00:03:01,344
I dare you.

10
00:03:01,804 --> 00:03:03,984
Are you sure
you're gonna mess with someone like me?

11
00:03:05,024 --> 00:03:06,504
You know all too well who I am.

12
00:03:06,784 --> 00:03:09,024
With just a snap of my fingers,
your life will be ruined!

13
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,784
It's your life that will be ruined.

14
00:03:11,064 --> 00:03:13,744
What a shameless home wrecker.

15
00:03:14,024 --> 00:03:15,344
You won't shut up, huh?!

16
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,364
Anyone who dares to challenge me

17
00:03:17,544 --> 00:03:20,584
is either in a coma or dead.

18
00:03:20,624 --> 00:03:21,744
You decide!

19
00:03:29,264 --> 00:03:30,264
Scalpel.

20
00:03:33,344 --> 00:03:34,504
Bovie forceps.

21
00:03:41,344 --> 00:03:42,264
Apply pressure.

22
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:43,624
Artery clamp.

23
00:03:47,384 --> 00:03:48,504
Push Heparin.

24
00:03:48,544 --> 00:03:49,864
Heparin is in.

25
00:03:49,904 --> 00:03:51,544
Insert the arterial cannula.

26
00:03:52,944 --> 00:03:54,064
Secure the line.

27
00:03:58,704 --> 00:03:59,624
Pump on.

28
00:03:59,664 --> 00:04:00,744
Connect the pump.

29
00:04:04,824 --> 00:04:05,984
He's now on pump.

30
00:04:06,144 --> 00:04:07,584
Everyone, you can relax.

31
00:04:19,114 --> 00:04:21,384
The patient is stable now.

32
00:04:21,644 --> 00:04:23,504
The surgery went well.

33
00:04:23,804 --> 00:04:26,134
Though, I'd like to keep him in the ICU

34
00:04:26,154 --> 00:04:27,624
for close observation.

35
00:04:29,784 --> 00:04:32,384
We could never
thank you enough, Dr. Premsinee.

36
00:04:32,944 --> 00:04:34,624
Thank you very much.

37
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,984
Thank you, Doctor, for saving my dad.

38
00:04:37,024 --> 00:04:37,824
Thank you.

39
00:04:40,944 --> 00:04:42,224
It's gonna be fine.

40
00:04:44,224 --> 00:04:45,224
Dad's fine now, sweetie.

41
00:04:49,314 --> 00:04:50,504
Cut!

42
00:04:50,544 --> 00:04:51,544
End slate.

43
00:04:53,104 --> 00:04:54,504
Cut three, take one.

44
00:04:55,944 --> 00:04:57,544
Pat, you did such a great job.

45
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,294
You delivered the emotions really well.

46
00:04:59,414 --> 00:05:02,374
Of course, look at
the fantastic teamwork we have.

47
00:05:02,444 --> 00:05:04,864
Let's take a lunch break
and run through the lines after.

48
00:05:05,874 --> 00:05:07,474
That was an amazing scene, you two.

49
00:05:07,504 --> 00:05:10,104
After the break, let's do the drama scene.

50
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,184
Of course.

51
00:05:11,224 --> 00:05:12,704
Thank you!

52
00:05:14,404 --> 00:05:16,304
- Here's your phone.
- Thank you!

53
00:05:16,844 --> 00:05:17,404
Pat!

54
00:05:23,844 --> 00:05:24,844
Nam!

55
00:05:31,514 --> 00:05:32,404
Wait a second.

56
00:05:32,574 --> 00:05:34,504
Shouldn't the manager
be the one taking care of her actress?

57
00:05:35,484 --> 00:05:37,744
It's not every day
you come visit me on set.

58
00:05:37,864 --> 00:05:39,264
Gotta give you special treatment.

59
00:05:41,554 --> 00:05:43,624
If you keep this up,

60
00:05:43,784 --> 00:05:45,724
I'd be so spoiled
I wouldn't know how to lift a finger.

61
00:05:46,484 --> 00:05:47,344
That's even better.

62
00:05:47,544 --> 00:05:49,344
That way
you won't be able to live without me.

63
00:05:52,494 --> 00:05:53,014
Here.

64
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,184
Nam, what's wrong?

65
00:05:58,904 --> 00:06:00,904
The restaurant
probably put too much cheese in.

66
00:06:01,164 --> 00:06:02,074
The smell's too strong.

67
00:06:02,914 --> 00:06:03,814
They did?

68
00:06:04,404 --> 00:06:06,904
What do you wanna eat, then?
I'll order it.

69
00:06:07,064 --> 00:06:08,104
Let me take care of it.

70
00:06:08,274 --> 00:06:09,444
It's fine, Pat.

71
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:11,634
I'm actually not that hungry.

72
00:06:12,324 --> 00:06:13,324
You go ahead and eat.

73
00:06:14,254 --> 00:06:15,954
Nam, are you sick?

74
00:06:29,294 --> 00:06:30,574
You don't feel hot, though.

75
00:06:32,424 --> 00:06:34,624
No, I'm fine.

76
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:38,194
Nam,

77
00:06:38,404 --> 00:06:39,824
I'm worried about you.

78
00:06:40,164 --> 00:06:41,374
If you don't feel your best,

79
00:06:41,404 --> 00:06:43,104
you need to tell me.

80
00:06:43,144 --> 00:06:44,364
No secrets,

81
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:45,384
you understand?

82
00:06:46,464 --> 00:06:48,814
Mm, I do.

83
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:52,424
Pinky promise.

84
00:06:55,184 --> 00:06:55,904
Mm,

85
00:06:57,024 --> 00:06:58,024
pinky promise.

86
00:06:59,864 --> 00:07:02,024
Isn't Prem already done with the surgery?

87
00:07:02,144 --> 00:07:03,574
How come she isn't here by now?

88
00:07:04,074 --> 00:07:05,174
Right?

89
00:07:05,744 --> 00:07:07,784
We've been waiting forever.

90
00:07:07,824 --> 00:07:08,624
- Hm...
- Wait,

91
00:07:08,754 --> 00:07:10,034
how many cases does she have?

92
00:07:10,244 --> 00:07:11,344
I don't know.

93
00:07:11,584 --> 00:07:12,704
I'm starving.

94
00:07:13,854 --> 00:07:15,254
What are you two gossiping about?

95
00:07:19,414 --> 00:07:21,954
You've never changed
from your med school years a bit.

96
00:07:22,344 --> 00:07:24,274
- Hi, Professor.
- Hello, Professor.

97
00:07:24,294 --> 00:07:25,024
Mm...

98
00:07:25,424 --> 00:07:26,864
We're not gossiping,

99
00:07:27,204 --> 00:07:28,534
just waiting for Prem.

100
00:07:28,554 --> 00:07:29,354
Hm...

101
00:07:30,204 --> 00:07:30,874
Look,

102
00:07:31,424 --> 00:07:32,424
there she is.

103
00:07:35,424 --> 00:07:36,764
Hi, Professor.

104
00:07:36,794 --> 00:07:37,794
Hi, there.

105
00:07:38,714 --> 00:07:39,384
Right,

106
00:07:39,744 --> 00:07:41,054
congratulations, Prem.

107
00:07:41,684 --> 00:07:43,064
I've got the invitation.

108
00:07:43,704 --> 00:07:44,904
Thank you, Professor.

109
00:07:45,564 --> 00:07:47,624
See you at the ceremony.

110
00:07:47,664 --> 00:07:48,904
See you there.

111
00:07:50,234 --> 00:07:51,434
- Bye.
- Bye.

112
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,504
Focus on your work.

113
00:07:53,984 --> 00:07:55,094
Roger that.

114
00:07:55,124 --> 00:07:57,124
- I'm leaving.
- Bye, Professor.

115
00:07:58,904 --> 00:07:59,624
Hey,

116
00:07:59,684 --> 00:08:02,704
You really take after Professor Tik!

117
00:08:03,364 --> 00:08:04,704
Not to mention Sita.

118
00:08:04,744 --> 00:08:05,594
How?

119
00:08:05,904 --> 00:08:07,264
Well, she has the sweetest face

120
00:08:07,604 --> 00:08:09,264
but is high-key brutal!

121
00:08:10,844 --> 00:08:12,264
Are you talking about me, Bow?

122
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:16,664
Nope, Sita.

123
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,424
I'd never gossip about you.

124
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:19,664
I'm missing you, that's all.

125
00:08:20,754 --> 00:08:22,034
You thought you were smooth?

126
00:08:26,904 --> 00:08:28,874
Are you ready for your bachelorette party,

127
00:08:28,904 --> 00:08:30,124
bride-to-be?

128
00:08:30,184 --> 00:08:32,954
We actually don't need the party, you know?

129
00:08:33,064 --> 00:08:34,984
We do!

130
00:08:35,024 --> 00:08:37,824
Leaving the single club
deserves a celebration,

131
00:08:37,864 --> 00:08:38,944
right, Sita?

132
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:40,704
Yes, it definitely does.

133
00:08:41,264 --> 00:08:42,184
- Let's roll!
- Let's do it.

134
00:08:42,224 --> 00:08:42,984
Alright.

135
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:58,304
Let's go!

136
00:08:58,594 --> 00:08:59,624
Not leaving unless we're drunk!

137
00:09:00,504 --> 00:09:01,344
Bring it on!

138
00:09:01,384 --> 00:09:02,824
Be a good girl today, alright?

139
00:09:02,864 --> 00:09:04,344
Let's get Sita drunk, then.

140
00:09:04,384 --> 00:09:05,544
You're cooked!

141
00:09:05,984 --> 00:09:06,624
Oops.

142
00:09:10,964 --> 00:09:12,584
Don't be shy tonight, bride-to-be.

143
00:09:13,584 --> 00:09:14,864
Go all out today, girl.

144
00:09:20,744 --> 00:09:22,824
There's still space. Keep backing up.

145
00:09:23,344 --> 00:09:24,224
Keep going.

146
00:09:24,704 --> 00:09:25,984
Keep going, keep going.

147
00:09:26,384 --> 00:09:27,544
Just a bit more.

148
00:09:27,824 --> 00:09:28,824
There!

149
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:53,984
Ticha.

150
00:10:05,544 --> 00:10:06,944
Could you please remove those glasses?

151
00:10:07,344 --> 00:10:08,864
People are staring.

152
00:10:09,464 --> 00:10:11,424
Didn't you say
you didn't want to be recognized?

153
00:10:11,464 --> 00:10:13,024
When you're this standout,

154
00:10:13,064 --> 00:10:14,664
there's no way they don't recognize you.

155
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,544
I just don't wanna meet the paparazzi.

156
00:10:16,804 --> 00:10:18,264
Pat, don't be.

157
00:10:18,304 --> 00:10:19,864
This is Win's club;

158
00:10:19,904 --> 00:10:21,264
there's no way something will leak.

159
00:10:21,624 --> 00:10:22,624
Plus,

160
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,664
they vet people before they come in.

161
00:10:27,464 --> 00:10:29,404
I'm just so sick of them

162
00:10:29,444 --> 00:10:32,304
shipping me with male actors.

163
00:10:32,344 --> 00:10:33,664
Do you wanna just tell them

164
00:10:33,704 --> 00:10:36,224
that you're actually into women,

165
00:10:36,524 --> 00:10:38,204
but the reason you wouldn't date anyone

166
00:10:38,234 --> 00:10:40,464
because you're foolishly into your friend?

167
00:10:42,884 --> 00:10:44,664
It's time
you start aiming for other people,

168
00:10:44,704 --> 00:10:46,184
not just Nam.

169
00:11:46,504 --> 00:11:47,184
Hey!

170
00:11:47,544 --> 00:11:48,304
I saw that.

171
00:11:48,824 --> 00:11:49,604
Saw what?

172
00:11:49,634 --> 00:11:50,834
Good start!

173
00:11:50,924 --> 00:11:52,604
Look around all you want

174
00:11:52,634 --> 00:11:53,634
at these girls.

175
00:12:00,464 --> 00:12:01,464
She's gorgeous, isn't she?

176
00:12:02,164 --> 00:12:03,344
Go ask her out.

177
00:12:03,664 --> 00:12:04,984
I'll ask her for her number.

178
00:12:05,274 --> 00:12:05,944
Stop!

179
00:12:07,384 --> 00:12:08,584
Sit back down!

180
00:12:22,344 --> 00:12:24,424
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

181
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:26,764
To Prem's bachelorette party!

182
00:12:26,794 --> 00:12:29,434
- Yay.
- Yay!

183
00:12:31,614 --> 00:12:34,094
Tan, why in the world are you crying?!

184
00:12:34,394 --> 00:12:36,194
This is a party, not a funeral!

185
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,914
I can't help the lump in my throat!

186
00:12:38,144 --> 00:12:40,304
It's gonna be lonely without you.

187
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,354
Even though I'm getting married,

188
00:12:43,264 --> 00:12:45,304
I'm still gonna be with you guys.

189
00:12:46,904 --> 00:12:50,104
Didn't you say
Prem deserves someone on her side?

190
00:12:50,674 --> 00:12:52,314
I'm just touched, Sita,

191
00:12:52,524 --> 00:12:54,424
that my friend will soon be a bride.

192
00:12:54,894 --> 00:12:56,144
A little jealous, too.

193
00:12:56,624 --> 00:12:58,504
You want the wedding gown for yourself?

194
00:12:58,784 --> 00:13:00,664
Hey, don't be such a know-it-all.

195
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,824
At the altar on your wedding day,

196
00:13:07,904 --> 00:13:11,384
the host will definitely ask you
how you met the groom

197
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:12,544
and when you fell in love.

198
00:13:12,674 --> 00:13:14,194
Wanna have a rehearsal now?

199
00:13:14,574 --> 00:13:15,644
That sounds lovely.

200
00:13:15,824 --> 00:13:17,784
A confidence boost for Prem.

201
00:13:21,144 --> 00:13:22,594
Well, let's start.

202
00:13:22,704 --> 00:13:26,024
What makes you fall in love with the groom?

203
00:13:35,184 --> 00:13:36,064
Right this way.

204
00:13:42,794 --> 00:13:44,674
Here's your seat.

205
00:13:45,084 --> 00:13:45,944
Thank you.

206
00:13:47,624 --> 00:13:49,344
This restaurant is amazing, Prem.

207
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:52,424
Thank you.

208
00:13:52,444 --> 00:13:53,384
Sweet Prem,

209
00:13:55,404 --> 00:13:56,304
big bite.

210
00:13:56,324 --> 00:13:57,164
Big, big bite.

211
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:09,344
Do you want me to give you a ride home?

212
00:14:09,364 --> 00:14:10,164
Please.

213
00:14:15,824 --> 00:14:17,264
Because he's such a gentleman.

214
00:14:18,054 --> 00:14:19,154
Ugh...

215
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:21,444
That's it?

216
00:14:22,274 --> 00:14:24,184
He's very consistent.

217
00:14:24,624 --> 00:14:26,304
He's still the person I first met

218
00:14:26,344 --> 00:14:29,184
after five years together.

219
00:14:29,384 --> 00:14:31,744
He puts me before himself,

220
00:14:32,264 --> 00:14:34,074
respects my family and me,

221
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:36,374
takes care, and pays attention to me.

222
00:14:36,994 --> 00:14:38,094
Boo,

223
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,784
that's so cliche!

224
00:14:40,824 --> 00:14:43,344
Can we have something more iconic?

225
00:14:44,594 --> 00:14:45,524
How?

226
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:48,474
Like, the way he makes your heart race

227
00:14:48,504 --> 00:14:50,584
or the way he becomes
someone you can't live without.

228
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:52,184
Those kinds of things.
Can't you think of one?

229
00:14:52,334 --> 00:14:53,234
Well,

230
00:14:56,494 --> 00:14:57,874
he treats me the best.

231
00:14:58,524 --> 00:14:59,664
Do you love him?

232
00:15:03,464 --> 00:15:05,784
Bow, that's a weird thing to ask.

233
00:15:06,084 --> 00:15:07,944
She definitely does.

234
00:15:13,864 --> 00:15:15,184
That's true, Sita.

235
00:15:15,344 --> 00:15:16,814
Bow, that was nonsense.

236
00:15:17,504 --> 00:15:19,004
Come on, don't be such a party pooper.

237
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:21,034
No poopers are allowed tonight!

238
00:15:21,324 --> 00:15:22,144
Ahem,

239
00:15:22,684 --> 00:15:23,784
Doctors,

240
00:15:24,304 --> 00:15:27,224
our girl is getting closer
to becoming a bride after tonight.

241
00:15:27,624 --> 00:15:30,504
Let's toast to Dr. Premsinee.

242
00:15:30,544 --> 00:15:32,074
Bottoms up!

243
00:15:32,104 --> 00:15:34,824
Bottoms up!

244
00:15:55,864 --> 00:15:56,464
Oops.

245
00:15:56,594 --> 00:15:57,474
Tan...

246
00:15:58,104 --> 00:15:59,624
Wow, look at you.

247
00:16:00,684 --> 00:16:02,354
I can't do this anymore.

248
00:16:02,464 --> 00:16:03,844
As you should.

249
00:16:03,884 --> 00:16:05,624
How many shots have you taken?

250
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,944
I wanna go home...

251
00:16:11,954 --> 00:16:14,034
Alright, alright.

252
00:16:14,184 --> 00:16:15,744
Wait for me here.

253
00:16:15,784 --> 00:16:16,904
Don't you move an inch.

254
00:16:16,944 --> 00:16:18,104
I'll find our friends.

255
00:16:18,524 --> 00:16:19,764
They took too damn long.

256
00:16:19,984 --> 00:16:21,424
Right, okay.

257
00:16:21,644 --> 00:16:23,144
- Mm.
- Mm, okay.

258
00:16:23,164 --> 00:16:24,444
Uh-huh..

259
00:16:24,944 --> 00:16:25,794
Don't move!

260
00:16:25,814 --> 00:16:26,924
- Mm!
- Gosh!

261
00:16:48,114 --> 00:16:49,674
You two were so busy flirting.

262
00:16:49,744 --> 00:16:50,784
Prem is...

263
00:16:50,804 --> 00:16:51,564
Wait!

264
00:16:53,264 --> 00:16:54,624
I told her to wait here.

265
00:16:54,664 --> 00:16:55,744
Where the hell is she?

266
00:16:57,044 --> 00:16:58,304
Well, go find her!

267
00:16:58,324 --> 00:16:59,324
- Right, okay.
- Go!

268
00:17:02,944 --> 00:17:04,384
Where's Bow's car?

269
00:17:08,604 --> 00:17:10,004
Here you are!

270
00:17:56,914 --> 00:17:57,664
Huh...

271
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,264
you're completely careless.

272
00:18:21,344 --> 00:18:22,424
Miss?

273
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:25,264
Miss?

274
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:32,384
Where the hell is she?

275
00:18:34,224 --> 00:18:35,544
We've looked everywhere!

276
00:18:35,984 --> 00:18:37,224
Where did she go?

277
00:18:37,404 --> 00:18:39,104
Don't tell me someone took her.

278
00:18:39,344 --> 00:18:39,974
Well,

279
00:18:40,004 --> 00:18:41,204
call her!

280
00:18:41,244 --> 00:18:42,394
Call her now!

281
00:18:56,954 --> 00:18:58,034
We're screwed.

282
00:18:59,424 --> 00:19:00,304
Miss...

283
00:19:01,364 --> 00:19:02,364
Miss!

284
00:19:02,744 --> 00:19:03,744
Miss!

285
00:19:05,904 --> 00:19:07,364
You're really drunk.

286
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:11,274
I guess there's no choice.

287
00:19:12,024 --> 00:19:13,344
I'll take you home.

288
00:20:18,704 --> 00:20:20,864
Do you see a woman with long hair...

289
00:20:21,704 --> 00:20:22,704
It's all because of you, Bow.

290
00:20:22,744 --> 00:20:24,844
I told you to hurry back to Prem,

291
00:20:25,064 --> 00:20:26,264
but you keep pushing me back.

292
00:20:26,484 --> 00:20:29,584
I didn't know
she was gonna disappear like this!

293
00:20:34,864 --> 00:20:36,864
He said he saw Prem walking outside.

294
00:20:37,264 --> 00:20:37,904
What?

295
00:20:37,944 --> 00:20:39,104
Where could she possibly be?!

296
00:20:39,144 --> 00:20:41,024
She didn't get into the wrong car, did she?

297
00:20:42,104 --> 00:20:44,984
Will she strip tonight?

298
00:20:46,584 --> 00:20:47,984
What do you think?

299
00:20:48,024 --> 00:20:50,864
With that much drinking,
will she strip?

300
00:20:56,944 --> 00:20:57,864
What are you doing?

301
00:20:59,054 --> 00:20:59,934
Miss?

302
00:21:01,474 --> 00:21:02,394
Miss!

303
00:21:02,864 --> 00:21:03,984
What are you doing?!

304
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,504
Hey, where are you going?

305
00:21:16,524 --> 00:21:18,284
Let go of me. I'm hot.

306
00:21:18,724 --> 00:21:19,564
You!

307
00:21:19,594 --> 00:21:20,554
Where are you going?

308
00:21:20,584 --> 00:21:22,714
Leave me alone!

309
00:21:23,284 --> 00:21:24,344
Miss!

310
00:21:24,614 --> 00:21:26,254
Ugh, don't touch me!

311
00:21:28,334 --> 00:21:29,214
Miss...

312
00:21:32,854 --> 00:21:33,944
I'm cold.

313
00:21:34,954 --> 00:21:35,694
What?

314
00:21:36,184 --> 00:21:37,704
You just said you were hot.

315
00:21:38,584 --> 00:21:39,724
I'm cold...

316
00:22:05,275 --> 00:22:06,275
I wanna go to bed...

317
00:22:06,615 --> 00:22:07,715
Hey, Miss!

318
00:22:08,915 --> 00:22:10,115
Miss!

319
00:23:20,955 --> 00:23:22,195
Did you just pass out?

320
00:23:44,135 --> 00:23:46,195
This is for stealing my bed.

321
00:23:48,115 --> 00:23:50,635
Wonder how shocked you'd be
by this mark.

322
00:24:13,095 --> 00:24:14,395
What happened?

323
00:24:31,915 --> 00:24:33,115
Last night,

324
00:24:34,035 --> 00:24:35,795
I got into Bow's car...

325
00:24:36,755 --> 00:24:38,595
How did I get here?

326
00:24:43,435 --> 00:24:44,755
What is this place?

327
00:25:20,835 --> 00:25:24,225
"Last night, you got in the wrong car

328
00:25:24,475 --> 00:25:26,365
while very drunk.

329
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:29,105
Don't remove your clothes
in front of anyone like that again."

330
00:25:32,955 --> 00:25:34,115
Thank you,

331
00:25:34,765 --> 00:25:36,005
Angel,

332
00:25:37,675 --> 00:25:39,195
for not taking advantage of me.

333
00:25:41,675 --> 00:25:42,505
Prem,

334
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,795
what happened last night?

335
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:45,675
Spill.

336
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:47,705
Yeah.

337
00:25:48,555 --> 00:25:49,395
Nothing happened.

338
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:51,955
Sit back down!

339
00:25:53,715 --> 00:25:54,805
Don't even think about lying.

340
00:25:55,115 --> 00:25:57,755
Yeah, there's no way nothing happened.

341
00:25:58,195 --> 00:25:59,715
You were so drunk last night, Prem.

342
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,355
We were so worried!

343
00:26:01,395 --> 00:26:03,515
I told you to wait,
and you wouldn't listen.

344
00:26:03,555 --> 00:26:05,035
You just walked out with a straight face!

345
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:08,315
I couldn't wait any longer last night.

346
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:10,715
So, what really happened?

347
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:13,115
And don't you dare say nothing did.

348
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,315
- We don't buy it!
- We don't buy it!

349
00:26:14,955 --> 00:26:16,195
Uh...

350
00:26:17,555 --> 00:26:18,915
I...

351
00:26:20,195 --> 00:26:20,995
I...

352
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:28,475
I got in the wrong car!

353
00:26:28,835 --> 00:26:29,835
- That's it?
- That's it?

354
00:26:31,975 --> 00:26:33,235
There's no way on earth.

355
00:26:34,205 --> 00:26:35,325
Tell us, now!

356
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:39,555
The car's owner took me to sleep
at their condo.

357
00:26:39,955 --> 00:26:40,955
- Sleep?
- Sleep?

358
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:44,355
Just sleep!

359
00:26:44,675 --> 00:26:45,955
They seem like a nice one.

360
00:26:46,025 --> 00:26:47,385
They didn't take advantage of me at all.

361
00:26:49,355 --> 00:26:50,115
Prem,

362
00:26:50,155 --> 00:26:51,995
are you sure they didn't...

363
00:26:52,035 --> 00:26:53,675
- Like, uh...
- Mm.

364
00:26:53,715 --> 00:26:54,955
do the deeds with you.

365
00:26:55,185 --> 00:26:56,185
I am!

366
00:26:56,805 --> 00:26:58,045
I'm a doctor.

367
00:26:58,305 --> 00:27:01,465
How could I not know
what happened to my body?

368
00:27:02,355 --> 00:27:03,995
If that's the case, then you're lucky.

369
00:27:04,035 --> 00:27:05,995
If they were someone evil,
you'd be screwed.

370
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:31,675
My necklace is gone...

371
00:27:34,835 --> 00:27:36,315
Instead, there's this mark on me.

372
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,195
I just knew they were a good person.

373
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:42,675
But is it a he or a she?

374
00:27:43,035 --> 00:27:45,915
I'm...not sure.

375
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,875
I think it's a she.

376
00:27:49,475 --> 00:27:50,185
Why?

377

Girl,

378
00:27:51,305 --> 00:27:52,265
think about it.

379
00:27:52,355 --> 00:27:55,315
If it were a man,
Prem wouldn't be this lucky.

380
00:27:55,735 --> 00:27:56,735
You're right.

381
00:28:00,995 --> 00:28:02,155
Are you completely sure?

382
00:28:05,355 --> 00:28:07,115
I am! Nothing's happened!

383
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:11,155
That's odd.

Wait,

391
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:42,075
are you alright?

392
00:28:42,915 --> 00:28:44,115
Why...

393
00:28:45,155 --> 00:28:46,635
do you look so unwell?

394
00:28:48,175 --> 00:28:49,095
Yeah,

395
00:28:49,825 --> 00:28:51,285
I'm okay.

396
00:28:54,015 --> 00:28:55,775
You said that yesterday,

397
00:28:56,215 --> 00:28:57,795
yet you didn't get any better.

398
00:28:57,835 --> 00:28:59,465
I should take you to the doctor.

399
00:28:59,585 --> 00:29:01,945
No, I don't wanna go.

00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,515
You can't say no, Nam.

401
00:29:03,905 --> 00:29:05,895
Look at how pale your face is.

402
00:29:09,355 --> 00:29:11,035

Getting sick like this

405
00:29:16,475 --> 00:29:17,875
is not nice, you know?

406
00:29:23,115 --> 00:29:24,675
You're burning up, though.

No,

no one ever does anything to me, Pat.

412
00:29:38,715 --> 00:29:40,475

that when there are no tears
on your face,

And how did it happen?

442
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:29,536
There's no need to know

443
00:32:31,156 --> 00:32:32,336
because he...

444
00:32:34,076 --> 00:32:36,076
He's getting married.

He's very consistent.

564
00:41:32,636 --> 00:41:34,316
He's still the person I first met

565
00:41:34,646 --> 00:41:38,166
after five years together.

566
00:41:40,696 --> 00:41:41,536
Prem.

567
00:41:41,736 --> 00:41:42,856
I think...

568
00:41:48,996 --> 00:41:50,356
You need to leave.

569
00:41:51,096 --> 00:41:52,216
You're a doctor, aren't you?

570
00:41:52,736 --> 00:41:54,616
After all this evidence,

571
00:41:55,696 --> 00:41:57,096
you're still burying
your head in the sand?

572
00:41:58,576 --> 00:42:00,096
What kind of oblivious, ignorant

573
00:42:00,116 --> 00:42:01,516
woman are you?

574
00:42:01,856 --> 00:42:05,576
Your groom knocked the other woman up.

575
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:08,656
He's making a fool out of you, Doc.

576
00:42:09,976 --> 00:42:11,456
It's time to wake up
and smell the coffee.

577
00:42:14,096 --> 00:42:15,616
There's not gonna be any wedding today.

578
00:42:20,816 --> 00:42:22,016
Satisfied?

579
00:42:22,776 --> 00:42:24,306
If you are,

580
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,816
go back the way you came,

581
00:42:26,416 --> 00:42:27,296
please.

582
00:43:16,397 --> 00:43:17,237
Prem,

583
00:43:17,747 --> 00:43:18,927
what's happening?

584
00:43:19,467 --> 00:43:20,867
Just go, Thawat.

585
00:43:21,117 --> 00:43:22,157
Wait, Prem.

586
00:43:22,177 --> 00:43:23,017
Prem!

587
00:43:23,757 --> 00:43:26,077
Why did you cancel the wedding?

588
00:43:26,597 --> 00:43:28,397
You know that all too well.

589
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:31,037
What do you mean?

590
00:43:31,487 --> 00:43:33,367
Do I have to say out loud

591
00:43:34,057 --> 00:43:36,057
what you did to the other woman?

592
00:43:39,237 --> 00:43:40,477
Prem,

593
00:43:42,757 --> 00:43:44,357
pay no attention to other people,

594
00:43:44,397 --> 00:43:45,277
please?

595
00:43:46,037 --> 00:43:46,867
Prem,

596
00:43:49,557 --> 00:43:50,757
calm down.

597
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,597
All that matters now

598
00:43:55,387 --> 00:43:57,907
is you're the woman I love the most.

599
00:44:03,597 --> 00:44:05,317
The woman you love the most?

600
00:44:07,957 --> 00:44:10,957
Then, why did you
get someone else pregnant?!

601
00:44:12,277 --> 00:44:13,557
That woman

602
00:44:14,157 --> 00:44:17,557
had her friend demand
her baby's father back at our wedding!

603
00:44:18,267 --> 00:44:20,907
I don't even know where to put myself!

604
00:44:20,937 --> 00:44:21,997
Calm down, Prem.

605
00:44:22,197 --> 00:44:23,477
I didn't do it!

606
00:44:23,917 --> 00:44:25,277
Listen to me, Prem.

607
00:44:26,357 --> 00:44:27,077
Prem,

608
00:44:27,877 --> 00:44:28,907
listen.

609
00:44:31,557 --> 00:44:32,797
Someone impersonated me

610
00:44:33,357 --> 00:44:34,637
with bad intention.

611
00:44:36,797 --> 00:44:38,437
You gotta believe me!

612
00:44:40,397 --> 00:44:41,077
Prem...

613
00:44:41,597 --> 00:44:42,637
Please.

614
00:44:43,477 --> 00:44:44,397
Prem...

615
00:44:46,787 --> 00:44:48,147
That's your business, not mine.

616
00:44:49,717 --> 00:44:51,357
But as for our wedding,

617
00:44:51,967 --> 00:44:53,367
I'm not willing to proceed!

618
00:44:53,597 --> 00:44:54,957
Prem, why...

619
00:44:54,997 --> 00:44:55,837
Prem!

620
00:44:57,077 --> 00:44:57,917
Father!

621
00:44:58,277 --> 00:45:00,877
How could you run away
from your own wedding?

622
00:45:00,897 --> 00:45:02,697
Go back to the ceremony at once, Prem!

623
00:45:02,837 --> 00:45:04,117
I won't, Father.

624
00:45:04,517 --> 00:45:06,277
You're ruining our reputation!

625
00:45:07,757 --> 00:45:09,607
But it's not my fault!

626
00:45:09,637 --> 00:45:11,077
There's no chance I'm getting married!

627
00:45:11,277 --> 00:45:12,317
Prem!

628
00:45:12,557 --> 00:45:13,317
Thawat,

629
00:45:14,037 --> 00:45:14,957
just leave for now.

630
00:45:15,237 --> 00:45:16,707
Let us talk to her.

631
00:45:26,237 --> 00:45:27,157
Prem,

632
00:45:27,327 --> 00:45:29,567
can we wait until after the ceremony?

633
00:45:31,197 --> 00:45:32,137
Mother...

634
00:45:33,127 --> 00:45:34,747
If you ever caught...

635
00:45:35,427 --> 00:45:37,227
Father cheating,

636
00:45:38,637 --> 00:45:40,677
would you carry on with the wedding?

637
00:45:45,017 --> 00:45:47,177
I'm sorry, Father, Mother,

638
00:45:48,117 --> 00:45:50,157
that I embarrassed you,

639
00:45:52,737 --> 00:45:56,737
but I can't force myself
to marry a betrayer.

640
00:45:58,497 --> 00:46:00,337
Alright, dear.

641
00:46:01,197 --> 00:46:03,197
I'm not gonna force you.

642
00:46:03,597 --> 00:46:05,397
It's all gonna be fine, Prem.

643
00:46:06,077 --> 00:46:07,157
It's okay.

644
00:46:12,897 --> 00:46:14,417
It's okay, dear.

645
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:19,077
Take it easy.

646
00:46:19,097 --> 00:46:20,947
It's alright, dear.

647
00:46:24,197 --> 00:46:25,197
Take it easy.

648
00:46:36,437 --> 00:46:37,207
Nam!

649
00:46:41,537 --> 00:46:42,297
Nam!

650
00:46:44,507 --> 00:46:45,307
Thawat!

651
00:46:46,107 --> 00:46:47,627
You're here for me?

652
00:46:51,037 --> 00:46:51,797
Thawat!

653
00:46:53,517 --> 00:46:54,317
Thawat!

654
00:46:55,147 --> 00:46:56,717
You came for me?

655
00:46:56,737 --> 00:46:58,537
I'm so happy!

656
00:46:59,757 --> 00:47:00,877
What did you do?

657
00:47:02,767 --> 00:47:05,247
How dare you
send your friend to ruin my wedding?

658
00:47:05,277 --> 00:47:07,267
I don't have anything to do with that...

659
00:47:07,287 --> 00:47:08,287
Don't you lie to me!

660
00:47:08,817 --> 00:47:10,437
I'm not lying!

661
00:47:10,677 --> 00:47:12,237
I have no idea what you meant!

662
00:47:12,917 --> 00:47:14,277
I love you, Thawat.

663
00:47:14,377 --> 00:47:16,617
I would never hurt you for the world.

664
00:47:17,347 --> 00:47:20,157
Then, don't claim
that I'm the father of your child!

665
00:47:20,347 --> 00:47:22,357
But it's really yours!

666
00:47:22,437 --> 00:47:24,427
How could I know for sure?!

667
00:47:24,647 --> 00:47:27,237
I don't even know
who you've been sleeping with!

668
00:47:27,917 --> 00:47:28,837
Thawat!

669
00:47:29,157 --> 00:47:30,917
You're the only one I have.

670
00:47:31,597 --> 00:47:33,437
I truly love you, Thawat.

671
00:47:34,157 --> 00:47:36,027
I love you the most.

672
00:47:36,917 --> 00:47:37,637
Love?

673
00:47:39,597 --> 00:47:42,157
Do you love me,
or are you just trying to baby trap me?

674
00:47:42,937 --> 00:47:44,317
No one in this world

675
00:47:44,997 --> 00:47:46,677
would want you
to be the mother of their children.

676
00:47:50,077 --> 00:47:52,117
But I'm pregnant with your baby.

677
00:47:52,997 --> 00:47:55,077
If I can't be the mother of your baby,

678
00:47:55,797 --> 00:47:57,197
I'm getting an abortion.

679
00:47:57,877 --> 00:47:59,257
Are you threatening me?

680
00:47:59,277 --> 00:48:00,577
I'm not.

681
00:48:00,917 --> 00:48:02,237
Since I'm the mother,

682
00:48:02,477 --> 00:48:04,307
I can do whatever I want with it.

683
00:48:05,077 --> 00:48:07,007
If you don't want this baby,

684
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:09,517
then I see no worth in carrying it.

685
00:48:11,957 --> 00:48:13,197
Go take a paternity test, then!

686
00:48:13,727 --> 00:48:15,057
If it's really mine,

687
00:48:15,087 --> 00:48:16,287
I will pay for child support.

688
00:48:18,517 --> 00:48:19,887
But don't you even think

689
00:48:20,037 --> 00:48:22,117
I'm gonna make a wife out of you.

690
00:48:23,277 --> 00:48:24,597
Your kind of woman

691
00:48:24,877 --> 00:48:26,937
doesn't deserve someone like me.

692
00:48:39,677 --> 00:48:40,877
Why did you do this?

693
00:48:41,337 --> 00:48:43,097
Why didn't you say
something to me first?

694
00:48:43,597 --> 00:48:46,357
Because I knew that if I did,

695
00:48:46,397 --> 00:48:48,157
you certainly would've stopped me.

696
00:48:48,177 --> 00:48:49,537
So why did you still go on with it?

697
00:48:49,917 --> 00:48:51,557
Because he deserves it, Nam!

698
00:48:51,577 --> 00:48:53,457
He hurt two women at the same time;

699
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:55,277
not only does he hurt you,

700
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,947
but he also hurts his girlfriend.

701
00:48:57,777 --> 00:48:59,897
You made him hate my guts!

702
00:49:00,197 --> 00:49:01,117
So what?

703
00:49:02,117 --> 00:49:04,197
You still care about that selfish being?

704
00:49:05,237 --> 00:49:07,477
I told you I love him

705
00:49:07,517 --> 00:49:08,917
and can't live without him!

706
00:49:08,937 --> 00:49:10,207
Don't you realize that?!

707
00:49:12,197 --> 00:49:13,637
So you're not coming to your senses?

708
00:49:14,047 --> 00:49:15,047
Coming to my senses?

709
00:49:16,457 --> 00:49:17,997
What are you even thinking, Pat?

710
00:49:18,657 --> 00:49:19,977
Didn't you say you love me?

711
00:49:20,447 --> 00:49:21,927
Didn't you say you understand?

712
00:49:22,797 --> 00:49:24,757
If so, why did you hurt me?!

713
00:49:28,077 --> 00:49:29,077
Nam,

714
00:49:30,557 --> 00:49:31,957
I did it all for you.

715
00:49:34,297 --> 00:49:36,657
Doesn't it mean anything to you?

716
00:49:37,377 --> 00:49:39,437
I never asked you to do any of that.

717
00:49:49,597 --> 00:49:50,397
Alright,

718
00:49:51,627 --> 00:49:52,877
everything I did

719
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:56,197
is gonna be the last thing
I ever did for you.

720
00:49:57,917 --> 00:49:59,547
There won't be a next time.

721
00:50:01,887 --> 00:50:03,337
I'm sorry

722
00:50:04,787 --> 00:50:06,387
that I upset you, Nam.

723
00:50:10,157 --> 00:50:12,157
But I think I've done the right thing.

724
00:50:12,937 --> 00:50:14,367
Not only did I save you,

725
00:50:14,587 --> 00:50:17,437
but I also helped that woman
come to the realization.

726
00:50:18,907 --> 00:50:20,787
If Thawat doesn't come back to me,

727
00:50:21,417 --> 00:50:23,457
I'll never forgive you.

728
00:50:43,917 --> 00:50:44,757
What's up?

729
00:50:46,787 --> 00:50:47,907
Ticha,

730
00:50:51,167 --> 00:50:53,207
I think I'm doing the right thing

731
00:50:55,477 --> 00:50:57,437
by getting over her.

732
00:50:58,087 --> 00:51:01,257
♫A forbidden love of two souls,♫

733
00:51:01,277 --> 00:51:04,677

♫The more I resist, the more I yearn♫

749
00:52:28,597 --> 00:52:34,357
♫In the end, to you, I always turn♫
