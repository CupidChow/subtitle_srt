00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,780
Darling,

2
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,530
the photos Thawat showed us...

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,770
They're not real.

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,150
Don't fall for edited photos, okay?

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,260
But they looked so real, darling.

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,660
Anything's possible
with today's technology.

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,710
Even those scammers

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,410
can pretend to be cops and fool people.

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,480
Don't worry about it.

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,360
I trust that our daughter

11
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,820
would never do anything
to bring shame to our family.

12
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,580
Pat,

13
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,010
it's time to wake up.

14
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,620
No.

15
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,540
I don't want to yet.

16
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,040
You can't sleep in.

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,540
You've got a morning gig, don't you?

18
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:16,900
I do.

19
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,020
What?

20
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,530
You know you do,

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,660
but why are you not up yet?

22
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,730
Can I stay in your arms
for five more minutes?

23
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,340
Please...

24
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,000
Prem.

25
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,750
You can't.

26
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,820
I have a patient visit
this morning as well.

27
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,740
Get up, okay?

28
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,950
You know how to make me get up,

29
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,540
don't you?

30
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,180
Is that enough?

31
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,580
You happy now?

32
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,560
Hm?

33
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,620
Enough?

34
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,310
Nope.

35
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,260
Will you please get up now?

36
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:48,810
♫No words needed to realize you're the one♫

37
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:59,190
♫I was born to be the moon to your sun♫

38
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,340
Was that enough to make you get up?

39
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,070
♫You're the love I'm longing for♫

40
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,010
You're so lovable, you know that?

41
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,890
Do you love me, then?

42
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,220
I sure do.

43
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:33,010
♫My heart will belong to you forever♫

44
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,420
I look pretty, don't I?

45
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,460
Yes.

46
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,650
You look gorgeous.

47
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,420
But you need to change your dress now.

48
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,060
Why, though?

49
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,220
I just got it recently

50
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,980
and wanted to wear it today.

51
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,860
You can't do that.

52
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,100
It's so revealing.

53
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,540
I won't let that happen.

54
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,020
You're possessive of me?

55
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,780
I am.

56
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,020
No one can see them;

57
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,290
only I can.

58
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,010
Got it?

59
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,620
You can still smile?

60
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,390
I love it

61
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,580
when you're possessive of me.

62
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,300
It looks so hot.

63
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,000
Alright.

64
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,000
I'll wear something else for you.

65
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,620
That's good.

66
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,210
You're the best.

67
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,170
So...

68
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,900
how do you usually reward...

69
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,700
the best one?

70
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,450
♫So this is love♫

71
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,650
♫So this is love♫

72
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,990
♫It's just dawned on me what love is♫

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,490
♫So this is love♫

74
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,520
♫So this is love♫

75
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,020
How naughty of you.

76

♫So this is love♫

77
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:54,960
- There she is.
- That's her!

78
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,670

- Miss Pat!
- Miss Pat!

80
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,430
Miss Pat,

81
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,370
can you explain what really happened?

82
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,229
Is this what caused the conflict
between you and your manager?

83
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,460
And what exactly are those leaked photos?

84
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:06,420
Sorry?

85
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,200
Do you really have no idea?

86
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:08,740
Here.

87
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:09,940
This is one of them.

88
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,100

Is she a friend or something more?

Can you tell us?

103
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,400
Who is she?

Are you dating a woman?

112
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,580
What's your relationship?

113
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,500
Miss Pat, answer our questions.

114
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,420
Are the photos real?

115
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,380
This woman...

116
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,740
and I...

117
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,399
are dating.

118
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,100
- They are dating!
- Are they?

119
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,540
They're dating.

120
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,260
Since when, Miss Pat?

121
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,700
Has it been long?

122
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,940
Is she in the industry, too?

123
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,520
Following the leak of photos
of the famous actress,

124
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,060
Pat Napak,

125
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,050
being affectionate

126
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,410
with another woman.

127
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:12,180
Miss Pat has officially admitted

128
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,430
that the woman

129
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,430
is her girlfriend.

130
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:16,690
The public response

131
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,050
has been positive, with many praising Miss Pat

132
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,810
for openly sharing that
she's attracted to women.

133
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,490
And right now,

134
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,700
we've also learned who her girlfriend is.

135
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,310
That's right.

136
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,550
It's none other than Dr. Premsinee,

137
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,580
who is a heart surgeon.

138
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,900
Doctor,

139
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,020
congratulations.

140
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,260
Aw!

141
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,130
What are you waiting for?
Give her a round of applause!

142
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,370
She deserves it.

143
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,510
Congratulations, doctor.

144
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,300
I'm so happy.

145
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,540
Hey!

146
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:58,570
What?

147
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,030
Do you remember

148
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:00,830
there was a time

149
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,420
someone sent her gifts all day, every day?

150
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,590
I do.

151
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,290
Wait, so it was...

152
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,740
- Miss Pat!
- Miss Pat!

153
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,950
- Yay!
- Yay!

154
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,310
Congrats, Prem.

155
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,340
You're something.

156
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,600
Pat's amazing.

157
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,970
I really admire her

158
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,230
for coming out like that.

159
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,150
Your story's gone viral now.

160
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,590
Everyone's talking about it.

161
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,580
What's with that face?

162
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,770
Well,

163
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,200
if it reaches everyone,

164
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,820
it'll reach my parents, too.

165
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,060
Hey, have you seen this woman?

166
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,100
Yeah, I have.

167
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:55,739
She's Professor Pratt's daughter.

168
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,340
- Really?
- She is?

169
00:08:56,341 --> 00:08:58,489
Yeah, the news says she's dating that actress.

170
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,230
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

171
00:08:59,231 --> 00:09:00,709
Is he really okay

172
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,980
- that she's dating a woman?
- I know, right?

173
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,500
Congratulations, Professor Pratt.

174
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,240
Why would you congratulate me?

175
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,859
No need to hide it.

176
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,220
We already know.

177
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,620
You're very progressive

178
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,190
for being accepting of this.

179
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,940
That's right. What a modern dad you are.

180
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,040
Please excuse us.

181
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,560
I get that
it's not considered wrong nowadays,

182
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,180
but to me, it's still not right.

183
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,999
It's against nature

184
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,539
and shouldn't be celebrated.

185
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,759
You're right, Professor.

186
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,140
Everything's so messed up these days.

187
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,969
I wonder how Professor Pratt

188
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,420
raised his daughter to turn out like this.

189
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,830
I bet he didn't know how to raise her.
That's why she's acting

190
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,660
so foolishly and disgustingly.

191
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:12,580
Wait,

192
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,939
could this be the reason her wedding...

193
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,380
was canceled?

194
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,639
I know, right?

195
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,919
- It could be.
- Yeah.

196
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,490
- Do you think so?
- Yeah.

197
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,020
It's definitely this.

198
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,039
A perverse woman like that,

199
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,860
no man would ever want her as a wife.

200
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,339
- Yeah.
- You're right.

201
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,340
My daughter isn't
what you're making her out to be.

202
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,870
Don't you dare
say another bad word about her.

203
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,140
Or I'll take all of you
to court for defamation.

204
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,140
Hey, have you seen this news?

205
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,899
Professor Rommanee's daughter

206
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,820
is dating that actress.

207
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,059
Yeah, I have.

208
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,179
The news is everywhere.

209
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,689
I never knew her daughter

210
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,420
would have these preferences.

211
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,260
Maybe she was disappointed by men.

212
00:11:05,905 --> 00:11:07,940
I feel sorry for Professor Rommanee.

213
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,039
She always hoped her daughter
would get married and have kids.

214
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,900
I wonder if she can handle this.

215
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,820
I know, right?

216
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,779
I'm supporting them.

217
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,219
Just get a man, doc.

218
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,499
Wake up, doc.

219
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,749
They're kinda cute, like idiots.

220
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,099
This is unacceptable.

221
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,759
Such a sick dyke.

222
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,339
The world's messed up.

223
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,380
Lesbians? That's weird.

224
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,460
Gosh...

225
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,200
Jeez...

226
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,140
What's with those sighs?

227
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,540
I just feel worried for Prem.

228
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,500
Right.

229
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,709
I can't even think

230
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,669
about how Prem's parents will react

231
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,860
to this news.

232
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,780
It shouldn't be too hard.

233
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,220
With a proper explanation from Prem,

234
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,140
I'm sure they'll understand.

235
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,560
It's not that easy, Sita.

236
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,850
You don't know her parents well enough.

237
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,420
[Mother]

238
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,300
It's my mother.

239
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,850
Hi, Mother, Father.

240
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,980
I already know everything.

241
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,660
I even know who leaked the photos.

242
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,660
And if people know that
your sweet Prem is a dyke...

243
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,540
who would want her?

244
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,210
Leak the photos.

245
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,500
It's Thawat.

246
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,619
I called you here

247
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,140
to discuss taking legal action
against him for defamation,

248
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,580
spreading lies,

249
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,140
causing confusion,
and damaging your reputation.

250
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:15,590
Prem,

251
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,020
why don't you say anything?

252
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,250
You're in shock, too, aren't you?

253
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,340
We understand, dear.

254
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,580
Mother, Father...

255
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,020
Pat and I...

256
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,500
are actually dating.

257
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,180
Thawat's not lying.

258
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,400
Prem...

259
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,370
Prem,

260
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,340
what do you mean?

261
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,300
I mean every word I say.

262
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,460
Pat and I...

263
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,900
are in love, Mother.

264
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,780
Easy, darling.

265
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,740
Mother...

266
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,059
Hey, don't joke around, Prem.

267
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,780
Do you even know
what you're talking about?

268
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,480
I do,

269
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,340
and I'm not joking.

270
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,560
Crazy...

271
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,420
Absolutely crazy.

272
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,729
What's going through your head

273
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,009
to make you do something so perverse?

274
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,100
Are you even sane?

275
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,540
I am.

276
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,940
I totally am.

277
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,300
I know full well what I'm doing.

278
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,070
Hey,

279
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,779
if you really do,

280
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,380
you won't be doing this.

281
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,220
Did that woman do something to you?

282
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,660
Is that why you've become like this?

283
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,420
She hasn't done anything, Father.

284
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,420
Our love is real.

285
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,220
Enough!

286
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,300
Enough with that word.

287
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,179
It makes me sick to my stomach.

288
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,909
Do you even know what people are saying?

289
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,180
They think you're disgusting.

290
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,570
And so do you, Mother, Father?

291
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,350
I haven't done anything wrong

292
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,270
or caused anyone trouble.

293
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,820
Why are you being this cruel to me?

294
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,030
You haven't done anything wrong

295
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,800
or caused anyone trouble?

296
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,230
Your mother and I
are the ones suffering!

297
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,800
We're drowning in shame.

298
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,420
Everyone at the college
is saying my daughter is a dyke!

299
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,680
I'm not letting this continue.

300
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,260
You're breaking up with her.

301
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,480
No,

302
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:20,820
I'm not.

303
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,530
Premsinee!

304
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:23,869
These days,

305
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,539
same-sex love

306
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,349
is completely normal, Father.

307
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,159
Not to me.

308
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,699
You're breaking up with her now.

309
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,620
Do as I say.

310
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,580
No,

311
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,220
I'm not breaking up with her.

312
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,120
I never will.

313
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,860
Look at your daughter.

314
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,650
How did you raise her, huh?

315
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,020
She's nothing but trouble.

316
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,620
Prem!

317
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,020
Prem, dear...

318
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,180
Prem...

319
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,900
I'm begging you.

320
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,220
Can you please do what your father says?

321
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,320
Do it for him

322
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,380
and for me.

323
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,510
Please, Prem.

324
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,860
I can't, Mother.

325
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,500
It must be my fault.

326
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,820
I didn't bring you up the right way.

327
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,340
It is my own decision, Mother.

328
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,700
Please don't blame yourself.

329
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,910
How can I not?

330
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,280
I raised you myself,

331
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,260
and look at what you're doing to us.

332
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,380
So you don't understand me as well, Mother?

333
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,560
Prem...

334
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,780
I'm begging you.

335
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,390
Please give your father what he wants.

336
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,220
Break up with her, Prem.

337
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,650
Prem...

338
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,500
No.

339
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,590
I've spent my whole life

340
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,340
obeying you and Father,

341
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,000
but this time,

342
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,100
I'm going to listen to my own heart.

343
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,250
Prem...

344
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,340
Prem!

345
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,200
Prem,

346
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,310
I mean...I'm sorry.

347
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,690
I'm sorry we were captured.

348
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,860
I never thought
it would blow up like this.

349
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,780
Please don't be mad at me, okay?

350
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,790
I'm not.

351
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,300
It's not your fault.

352
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,490
I was afraid you'd be ashamed...

353
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,060
of dating me.

354
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,980
I'm not.

355
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,860
I'm actually proud

356
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,090
to have such a wonderful girlfriend.

357
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,580
Thank you

358
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,500
for telling everyone the truth.

359
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,300
Are you really not mad at me?

360
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:28,960
Yes.

361
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,180
Then, why are you making that face?

362
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,780
I'm just tired.

363
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,010
Pat,

364
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,420
can I please get a hug?

365
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,900
Sure.

366
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:19,620
♫No words needed to realize you're the one♫

367
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,260
Does it make you feel better?

368
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,780
How warm.

369
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:37,620
♫With you by my side,
there's nothing else I'd like♫

370
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,420
Now, go change.

371
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,540
Where are we going?

372
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,500
Come inside with me.

373
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,980
I'd like to introduce you to my family.

374
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,520
You don't have to do that, actually.

375
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,520
I've met both of your parents already.

376
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,910
But you were just their doctor.

377
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,020
Right now, you're my special person.

378
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,860
You mean a lot to me, Prem.

379
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,070
I just want everyone to see the real you

380
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,900
that I see.

381
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,460
I love you, Prem.

382
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,900
We might not have started off
on the right foot,

383
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,540
but my heart now belongs to you.

384
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,330
And once we get married,

385
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,900
I'll give you everything I own.

386
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,600
You love me that much?

387
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,300
Yes.

388
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,100
I'll only ask for one thing.

389
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,420
Dr. Premsinee, don't you ever be cruel to me.

390
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,700
I wouldn't be able to bear it if you were.

391
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:10,220
I'd never be cruel to you.

392
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:14,980
Come on,

393
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,200
let's come inside.

394
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:20,160
Everyone's waiting to celebrate our love.

395
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,680
You are my love, Prem.

396
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:30,550
I know.

397
00:23:04,378 --> 00:23:05,688
Papa, Mama,

398
00:23:06,168 --> 00:23:08,088
enough with the staring.

399
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,038
You're making her nervous.

400
00:23:12,568 --> 00:23:14,007
Uh...

401
00:23:14,008 --> 00:23:15,337
My bad.

402
00:23:15,338 --> 00:23:17,217
Seeing you outside the hospital like this...

403
00:23:17,218 --> 00:23:19,526
I'm quite nervous as well.

404
00:23:21,398 --> 00:23:23,128
Please make yourself comfortable.

405
00:23:23,548 --> 00:23:25,267
Oh, okay.

406
00:23:25,268 --> 00:23:26,368
She's right.

407
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,828
Easy, Papa.

408
00:23:30,578 --> 00:23:32,328
Relax, Mama.

409
00:23:34,378 --> 00:23:35,208
Okay.

410
00:23:35,209 --> 00:23:36,547
Then...

411
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,278
should we get straight to the point?

412
00:23:40,528 --> 00:23:41,488
What point?

413
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:43,258
I'll go first.

414
00:23:43,268 --> 00:23:44,538
Yeah, go ahead.

415
00:23:45,328 --> 00:23:48,208
Well... Uh, Prem...

416
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,088
Please take care of Pat.

417
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:53,397
I'll entrust her to you, too.

418
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:55,037
If my daughter ever acts out,

419
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:57,367
you have my permission to discipline her.

420
00:23:57,368 --> 00:23:58,328
Same here.

421
00:24:00,608 --> 00:24:01,568
If so,

422
00:24:01,868 --> 00:24:03,157
I'm not holding anything back.

423
00:24:03,158 --> 00:24:04,228
That's nice.

424
00:24:04,718 --> 00:24:05,408
What?

425
00:24:05,548 --> 00:24:07,328
Why are you ganging up on me?

426
00:24:09,078 --> 00:24:11,267
We're not ganging up on you.

427
00:24:11,268 --> 00:24:12,437
We're just giving you...

428
00:24:12,438 --> 00:24:14,208
- so much love!
- So much love!

429
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:17,918
Listen.

430
00:24:18,028 --> 00:24:19,047
Let me tell you.

431
00:24:19,048 --> 00:24:21,158
You can come over anytime, Prem.

432
00:24:21,448 --> 00:24:23,688
You're always welcome here.

433
00:24:23,908 --> 00:24:25,169
Thank you.

434
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,668
No worries.

435
00:24:26,678 --> 00:24:28,008
- You're always welcome.
- Right.

436
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:34,607
I told Mama what your favorite dishes are,

437
00:24:34,608 --> 00:24:36,528
so she made sure
to have them all ready for you.

438
00:24:37,308 --> 00:24:38,968
And not only that,

439
00:24:39,138 --> 00:24:41,008
she even cooked these dishes herself.

440
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,967
Thank you, Mrs. Nonthakan.

441
00:24:44,968 --> 00:24:46,307
Instead of calling me that,

442
00:24:46,308 --> 00:24:48,677
you can call me the same way Pat does.

443
00:24:48,678 --> 00:24:49,698
Right,

444
00:24:49,968 --> 00:24:51,618
we're family now.

445
00:24:56,608 --> 00:24:57,780
Alright, Papa.

446
00:24:57,878 --> 00:24:58,898
Okay, Mama.

447
00:24:59,088 --> 00:25:00,817
That's more like it.

448
00:25:00,818 --> 00:25:02,928
Sounds perfect, don't you think?

449
00:25:04,698 --> 00:25:05,618
Alright, then.

450
00:25:05,848 --> 00:25:06,628
Pat...

451
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:08,577
Got it.

452
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:13,128
What would you like, Prem?

453
00:25:14,088 --> 00:25:15,298
Just anything.

454
00:25:15,428 --> 00:25:16,778
Every dish looks amazing.

455
00:25:34,918 --> 00:25:36,698
I'm so stuffed

456
00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:38,678
that my stomach's about to burst.

457
00:25:40,042 --> 00:25:41,128
Of course you are.

458
00:25:41,138 --> 00:25:42,107
You ate...

459
00:25:42,108 --> 00:25:44,557
two full servings on your own.

460
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:45,908
- Right.
- Yeah.

461
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:48,127
Your food was just too good.

462
00:25:48,617 --> 00:25:50,528
Don't try to butter me up.

463
00:25:50,788 --> 00:25:52,678
You can ask Prem.

464
00:25:53,058 --> 00:25:54,687
It's the first time

465
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,998
I've ever seen her eat this much.

466
00:25:58,418 --> 00:25:59,648
Pat's right, Mama.

467
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:02,498
The food you made was really delicious.

468
00:26:02,648 --> 00:26:04,568
I'm completely full.

469
00:26:05,588 --> 00:26:06,168
Honey...

470
00:26:06,518 --> 00:26:07,088
Yeah?

471
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:08,727
Will you catch me?

472
00:26:08,728 --> 00:26:09,617
Why, though?

473
00:26:09,618 --> 00:26:11,728
I feel like I'm about to float away.

474
00:26:11,828 --> 00:26:12,687
Whoa,

475
00:26:12,688 --> 00:26:15,088
how would that be possible?

476
00:26:15,228 --> 00:26:18,257
Hey, honey,
or I won't cook you anything anymore.

477
00:26:18,258 --> 00:26:19,088
Oh...

478
00:26:19,198 --> 00:26:20,657
- Whoa, you're actually floating.
- Whoa...

479
00:26:20,658 --> 00:26:21,488
Let me catch you.

480
00:26:21,578 --> 00:26:22,767
Girls, she's actually floating.

481
00:26:22,768 --> 00:26:23,827
How mean.

482
00:26:23,828 --> 00:26:26,288
Your food was incredible, though.

483
00:26:26,428 --> 00:26:27,248
Stop it.

484
00:26:27,249 --> 00:26:28,518
Come on, Pat.

485
00:26:28,688 --> 00:26:32,067
Help me pack up the food
for Prem to bring home.

486
00:26:32,068 --> 00:26:33,008
Alright.

487
00:26:33,588 --> 00:26:34,238
Let's go.

488
00:26:36,138 --> 00:26:37,327
If you'll excuse me...

489
00:26:37,328 --> 00:26:38,118
Alright.

490
00:26:38,768 --> 00:26:40,058
Thank you.

491
00:26:40,608 --> 00:26:41,968
Well, Prem,

492
00:26:42,318 --> 00:26:43,577
that was so much food, wasn't it?

493
00:26:43,578 --> 00:26:44,738
Yes, Papa.

494
00:26:45,168 --> 00:26:45,888
How about...

495
00:26:45,889 --> 00:26:47,848
we go walk it off for a bit?

496
00:26:47,988 --> 00:26:49,048
Sure.

497
00:26:55,558 --> 00:26:56,728
Thank you, sweetie.

498
00:26:57,298 --> 00:26:58,918
For what, Papa?

499
00:27:00,408 --> 00:27:02,968
For loving my daughter, of course.

500
00:27:05,538 --> 00:27:06,198
Look,

501
00:27:06,728 --> 00:27:10,108
you may think Pat seems lively and cheerful,

502
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,008
but she used to be different.

503
00:27:13,688 --> 00:27:15,377
I want to share her past with you,

504
00:27:15,378 --> 00:27:17,368
so you can understand her better

505
00:27:18,088 --> 00:27:19,448
and maybe, in the future,

506
00:27:20,408 --> 00:27:22,208
you can forgive her easily.

507
00:27:22,464 --> 00:27:23,168
Okay.

508
00:27:24,608 --> 00:27:25,648
When Pat was young,

509
00:27:26,768 --> 00:27:29,407
she was a timid girl,

510
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,928
who was hesitant to act on her own.

511
00:27:31,258 --> 00:27:32,368
She was so soft-hearted

512
00:27:32,598 --> 00:27:35,288
that she'd give everyone what they wanted.

513
00:27:36,418 --> 00:27:38,908
She was also often bullied by her friends.

514
00:27:39,618 --> 00:27:40,888
I was so stressed

515
00:27:41,548 --> 00:27:43,688
that I even had to consult a psychiatrist.

516
00:27:44,388 --> 00:27:45,818
Since then,

517
00:27:46,018 --> 00:27:47,488
both Mama and I

518
00:27:47,628 --> 00:27:49,888
have done our best to take care of Pat.

519
00:27:50,928 --> 00:27:51,888
And eventually,

520
00:27:52,358 --> 00:27:54,108
the timid girl

521
00:27:54,888 --> 00:27:58,408
grew into the strong, beautiful woman
you see today.

522
00:27:59,988 --> 00:28:01,098
You know what?

523
00:28:01,988 --> 00:28:03,188
The first day

524
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:06,208
Pat told me she had a crush on you...

525
00:28:07,878 --> 00:28:09,417
I prepared myself

526
00:28:09,418 --> 00:28:11,968
to console her
in case she couldn't win your heart.

527
00:28:13,888 --> 00:28:15,138
But seeing you two now,

528
00:28:15,468 --> 00:28:16,768
I'm truly happy.

529
00:28:17,728 --> 00:28:19,168
She made the right choice.

530
00:28:20,118 --> 00:28:21,688
I'm sure you're a good person,

531
00:28:22,028 --> 00:28:23,368
and I trust

532
00:28:23,998 --> 00:28:26,728
that you two will go far together

533
00:28:27,298 --> 00:28:28,568
and love each other deeply.

534
00:28:31,088 --> 00:28:32,617
Thank you once again

535
00:28:32,618 --> 00:28:34,258
for the love you have for my daughter.

536
00:28:35,368 --> 00:28:37,538
I should be the one thanking you.

537
00:28:38,268 --> 00:28:41,088
You and Mama took such good care of Pat

538
00:28:42,408 --> 00:28:44,528
that she grew into
someone I fell in love with.

539
00:28:48,628 --> 00:28:51,008
Don't you ever hurt Dr. Prem, okay?

540
00:28:52,258 --> 00:28:54,158
What kind of person do you think I am?

541
00:28:54,738 --> 00:28:56,767
I'm loyal, you know?

542
00:28:57,988 --> 00:28:58,688
Fine.

543
00:28:58,689 --> 00:28:59,848
I'll believe that.

544
00:29:00,548 --> 00:29:02,248
I'm serious, Mama.

545
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:04,648
I'm so happy right now.

546
00:29:06,208 --> 00:29:07,528
I can tell.

547
00:29:12,148 --> 00:29:13,588
But the happier I get,

548
00:29:13,828 --> 00:29:15,338
the more I start to feel scared.

549
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:20,178
I'm scared that if I lose Prem one day,
I won't know what to do.

550
00:29:20,464 --> 00:29:23,568
I can't even picture my life without her.

551
00:29:24,808 --> 00:29:25,967
If you can't,

552
00:29:25,968 --> 00:29:27,608
then why even think about it?

553
00:29:28,298 --> 00:29:29,647
Live in the present

554
00:29:29,648 --> 00:29:32,848
and enjoy it to the fullest, my girl.

555
00:29:34,908 --> 00:29:35,488
Okay.

556
00:29:37,748 --> 00:29:41,368
I'm glad you've found a good love.

557
00:29:43,768 --> 00:29:47,128
That's because you and Papa showed me
what a good love looks like

558
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:50,008
and accepted me for who I am.

559
00:29:51,368 --> 00:29:52,648
I love you, Mama.

560
00:29:52,998 --> 00:29:53,642
I know.

561
00:29:56,518 --> 00:29:58,277
I love you, too,

562
00:29:58,278 --> 00:30:00,048
so, so much.

563
00:30:47,758 --> 00:30:49,667
Ta-da!

564
00:30:49,668 --> 00:30:51,588
This is my bedroom.

565
00:30:52,628 --> 00:30:53,768
Uh...

566
00:30:54,588 --> 00:30:57,168
I can't believe your room is so...

567
00:30:59,088 --> 00:31:00,228
So?

568
00:31:01,878 --> 00:31:03,528
You're hot and sexy,

569
00:31:04,838 --> 00:31:06,448
but your room is like a princess' palace.

570
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,578
I mostly stay at the condo,

571
00:31:08,768 --> 00:31:10,368
so I haven't felt like redecorating.

572
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:13,728
A dreamy girl, huh?

573
00:31:16,438 --> 00:31:17,828
Who would've guessed...

574
00:31:18,448 --> 00:31:20,308
that such a stunning villainess

575
00:31:20,758 --> 00:31:22,538
also longs for a princess' fantasy?

576
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:28,608
Pat,

577
00:31:29,308 --> 00:31:30,318
what are you doing?

578
00:31:31,218 --> 00:31:32,398
It's your parents' house.

579
00:31:33,908 --> 00:31:34,820
I want you

580
00:31:34,821 --> 00:31:36,528
to be a princess in my fantasy.

581
00:31:36,988 --> 00:31:38,457
So you're a prince or what?

582
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:39,258
Nope.

583
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:43,808
I'm a princess
who's in love with Princess Premsinee.

584
00:31:45,518 --> 00:31:47,288
Your words have gotten pretty sweet lately.

585
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:51,128
And those sweet words
are meant just for you,

586
00:31:51,978 --> 00:31:52,928
my princess.

587
00:31:57,688 --> 00:32:00,035
♫So this is love♫

588
00:32:00,071 --> 00:32:04,100
♫So this is love♫

589
00:32:04,168 --> 00:32:07,527
♫It's just dawned on me what love is♫

590
00:32:07,591 --> 00:32:09,991
♫So this is love♫

591
00:32:10,064 --> 00:32:13,318
♫So this is love♫

592
00:32:13,337 --> 00:32:14,678
And from now on,

593
00:32:15,408 --> 00:32:16,518
I, Princess Pat,

594
00:32:16,738 --> 00:32:19,608
vow to protect you, Princess Premsinee,
from everything.

595
00:32:22,318 --> 00:32:27,220
♫Love, love, love♫

596
00:32:27,257 --> 00:32:32,246
♫Love, love, love♫

597
00:32:32,298 --> 00:32:34,368
♫Love, love♫

598
00:32:35,588 --> 00:32:37,627
♫So this is love♫

599
00:32:37,628 --> 00:32:42,667
♫The closer to your warmth,
the stronger my love feels♫

600
00:32:42,668 --> 00:32:47,647
♫I've just realized
why everyone says it heals♫

601
00:32:52,288 --> 00:32:53,562
I love you...

602
00:32:55,188 --> 00:32:56,488
my princess.

603
00:33:03,728 --> 00:33:05,402
How should we talk to her?

604
00:33:08,726 --> 00:33:10,573
I honestly don't know.

605
00:33:10,578 --> 00:33:12,515
We've tried talking nicely and even harshly,

606
00:33:12,728 --> 00:33:14,528
but she wouldn't listen at all.

607
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:18,368
If she gets to date a guy,

608
00:33:19,328 --> 00:33:21,169
she might get over this odd behavior.

609
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,608
And who would that guy be?

610
00:33:26,008 --> 00:33:27,366
I think...

611
00:33:27,368 --> 00:33:30,328
maybe she could date my friend's son.

612
00:33:31,002 --> 00:33:33,208
He's Krich.
He just got his doctorate from abroad.

613
00:33:34,006 --> 00:33:35,962
You mean that professor?

614
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:36,828
Yes.

615
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:39,408
Krich and Prem already know each other.

616
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:41,808
Darling,

617
00:33:42,078 --> 00:33:43,728
ask Prem to return home.

618
00:33:44,338 --> 00:33:45,968
But I'm worried she might...

619
00:33:46,144 --> 00:33:47,987
You raised her yourself.

620
00:33:47,988 --> 00:33:51,082
You're supposed to know
how to phrase it so she won't say no.

621
00:33:52,328 --> 00:33:54,406
I won't let her life be ruined

622
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:55,768
by this nonsense.

623
00:33:56,108 --> 00:33:58,871
After all, women are meant to be with men.

624
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,448
You can just drop me off here.

625
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:22,740
No.

626
00:34:27,758 --> 00:34:29,008
What are you doing?

627
00:34:29,528 --> 00:34:31,728
We're going to walk hand in hand.

628
00:34:33,168 --> 00:34:35,853
Everyone already knows
about our relationship.

629
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,288
Let's hold hands and walk in together.

630
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,168
Please, Prem.

631
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:10,333
They're so cute!

632
00:35:10,528 --> 00:35:11,448
I know.

633
00:35:24,093 --> 00:35:25,911
Thank you for coming with me,

634
00:35:26,311 --> 00:35:27,088
but...

635
00:35:27,671 --> 00:35:29,208
you should go to work now.

636
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,888
I will

637
00:35:34,368 --> 00:35:35,688
if you...

638
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:40,048
No!

639
00:35:40,406 --> 00:35:41,687
Why not?

640
00:35:41,688 --> 00:35:42,915
If you don't do it,

641
00:35:43,264 --> 00:35:44,408
I won't leave.

642
00:35:45,526 --> 00:35:47,068
Come on,

643
00:35:47,722 --> 00:35:49,048
my Prem.

644
00:35:51,373 --> 00:35:52,008
Okay.

645
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,088
I'm picking you up this evening.

646
00:35:59,257 --> 00:35:59,926
Okay.

647
00:36:01,475 --> 00:36:02,288
Bye-bye.

648
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:04,988
See you.

649
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:09,008
I'm leaving.

650
00:36:09,548 --> 00:36:10,728
Work hard, okay?

651
00:36:10,893 --> 00:36:11,688
Should I stay?

652
00:36:12,648 --> 00:36:13,904
Go to work.

653
00:36:13,908 --> 00:36:14,568
Okay.

654
00:36:14,813 --> 00:36:16,488
- Bye-bye.
- See you.

655
00:36:19,242 --> 00:36:20,638
I'm actually leaving.

656
00:36:20,808 --> 00:36:21,584
Okay.

657
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:23,568
Don't miss me too much, okay?

658
00:36:42,128 --> 00:36:44,248
[Mother]

659
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,368
Yes, Mother?

660
00:36:58,042 --> 00:36:59,104
- Give me a second.
- Okay.

661
00:37:01,728 --> 00:37:03,648
You don't need to pick me up today.

662
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:06,008
I have to go see my family.

663
00:37:34,534 --> 00:37:35,296
Oh,

664
00:37:35,297 --> 00:37:36,483
Prem?

665
00:37:36,832 --> 00:37:37,610
Come on in.

666
00:37:37,611 --> 00:37:39,615
Jeez, why would you just stand there?

667
00:37:39,616 --> 00:37:41,016
Come on.

668
00:37:43,057 --> 00:37:44,134
Take a seat there.

669
00:37:50,256 --> 00:37:51,576
Do you remember Professor Krich?

670
00:37:52,672 --> 00:37:53,976
I sure do.

671
00:37:54,936 --> 00:37:56,856
Long time to see, Krich.

672
00:37:57,516 --> 00:37:58,176
I know.

673
00:37:59,865 --> 00:38:01,632
He came to visit us

674
00:38:01,636 --> 00:38:03,256
and brought lots of gifts.

675
00:38:04,216 --> 00:38:06,496
Join us for dinner today, okay?

676
00:38:06,686 --> 00:38:07,456
Sure.

677
00:38:07,457 --> 00:38:08,816
I don't have any plans anyway.

678
00:38:08,966 --> 00:38:10,497
That's perfect.

679
00:38:11,096 --> 00:38:14,376
Prem, spend some time talking with him
while waiting for the food.

680
00:38:15,816 --> 00:38:16,776
Okay.

681
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:18,803
You two go ahead and talk.

682
00:38:18,806 --> 00:38:19,744
Feel free.

683
00:38:19,745 --> 00:38:20,788
We'll be right back.

684
00:38:32,116 --> 00:38:33,646
Your house looks amazing.

685
00:38:36,756 --> 00:38:37,843
Krich.

686
00:38:39,748 --> 00:38:42,056
Please don't take this the wrong way,

687
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:44,752
but I think...

688
00:38:44,936 --> 00:38:46,665
you should leave.

689
00:38:47,336 --> 00:38:49,256
I'll tell my parents

690
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:51,472
that something urgent came up.

691
00:38:53,348 --> 00:38:55,496
I'm sorry for handling it this way,

692
00:38:56,636 --> 00:38:58,665
but I don't want to waste your time.

693
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:01,736
If it's because of your relationship
with the actress,

694
00:39:01,886 --> 00:39:02,976
I understand.

695
00:39:04,243 --> 00:39:05,376
You do?

696
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:09,336
I know your parents are upset about it,

697
00:39:09,537 --> 00:39:11,376
so they're trying to set us up.

698
00:39:13,021 --> 00:39:14,736
But I have a different view.

699
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,616
I think it's better
not to go against them for now.

700
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:18,992
Otherwise,

701
00:39:18,996 --> 00:39:21,456
it'll only make them
dislike that woman even more.

702
00:39:21,886 --> 00:39:23,072
I don't get it.

703
00:39:23,696 --> 00:39:25,336
Why are you helping me?

704
00:39:27,152 --> 00:39:28,216
It's not because

705
00:39:28,374 --> 00:39:30,376
I'm expecting you to like me.

706
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:32,534
I'm helping you

707
00:39:32,776 --> 00:39:35,176
because I know love can't be forced,

708
00:39:35,508 --> 00:39:36,776
no matter who it's between.

709
00:39:36,948 --> 00:39:38,555
No matter the gender,

710
00:39:38,556 --> 00:39:39,916
love is always possible.

711
00:39:40,723 --> 00:39:42,056
And it's not wrong

712
00:39:42,272 --> 00:39:43,496
to just love someone.

713
00:39:47,254 --> 00:39:48,548
It feels nice

714
00:39:48,776 --> 00:39:50,083
to finally be understood.

715
00:39:51,043 --> 00:39:53,341
If you ever want to talk or need advice,

716
00:39:53,346 --> 00:39:54,446
I'm all ears.

717
00:39:55,137 --> 00:39:56,256
I'm a good listener, you know?

718
00:39:57,506 --> 00:39:58,425
Thank you.

719
00:40:00,936 --> 00:40:02,541
I'm taking my leave.

720
00:40:03,266 --> 00:40:06,705
Feel free to take her out
for a movie or a meal when you're free.

721
00:40:06,706 --> 00:40:08,495
Sure, I've already got her number.

722
00:40:10,701 --> 00:40:11,661
I'm leaving.

723
00:40:12,026 --> 00:40:12,816
Okay.

724
00:40:13,296 --> 00:40:14,672
Goodbye, Auntie, Uncle.

725
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:15,835
- See you later.
- Get home safely.

726
00:40:15,836 --> 00:40:16,665
Goodbye.

727
00:40:24,308 --> 00:40:24,896
Prem.

728
00:40:26,096 --> 00:40:27,055
Sit down.

729
00:40:27,056 --> 00:40:28,496
We want to talk to you.

730
00:40:42,534 --> 00:40:43,736
How is Krich?

731
00:40:44,156 --> 00:40:45,056
He's fine.

732
00:40:47,123 --> 00:40:48,976
I'd like you to consider dating him.

733
00:40:49,574 --> 00:40:51,776
I don't think I can, Father.

734
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:55,376
We're not familiar enough with each other.

735
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:56,925
Also,

736
00:40:56,926 --> 00:40:58,376
- Pat and I are...
- Stop that.

737
00:40:59,494 --> 00:41:00,296
That's enough.

738
00:41:00,614 --> 00:41:03,057
Don't ever bring up that name in this house.

739
00:41:03,058 --> 00:41:04,136
I don't want to hear it.

740
00:41:04,856 --> 00:41:07,216
You're being unreasonable again, Father.

741
00:41:07,356 --> 00:41:09,005
Unreasonable?

742
00:41:09,006 --> 00:41:11,101
I'm doing this for your own good.

743
00:41:11,416 --> 00:41:13,581
I just want you to end up with Krich.

744
00:41:13,586 --> 00:41:16,839
And giving him a chance can't hurt, can it?

745
00:41:17,096 --> 00:41:19,043
I'm not planning to get married again, Father.

746
00:41:19,046 --> 00:41:20,296
Premsinee!

747
00:41:20,694 --> 00:41:22,323
I'm sure both of you know

748
00:41:22,326 --> 00:41:24,359
why I don't want to get married again.

749
00:41:25,501 --> 00:41:26,056
Hey,

750
00:41:26,057 --> 00:41:28,694
are you venting your frustration
about your previous marriage?

751
00:41:29,096 --> 00:41:30,323
I'm not just venting.

752
00:41:33,581 --> 00:41:36,868
You are well aware
same-sex love isn't right.

753
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:38,803
You even told me yourself

754
00:41:38,806 --> 00:41:41,536
that you wanted to get married
and start a family.

755
00:41:41,537 --> 00:41:43,455
So why are you changing your mind now?

756
00:41:43,456 --> 00:41:44,097
Father...

757
00:41:44,098 --> 00:41:46,485
All parents want what's best
for their children.

758
00:41:46,486 --> 00:41:50,016
Think about it. Are you sure
what you're doing is truly right?

759
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,635
Can you really accept it

760
00:41:52,636 --> 00:41:54,605
if someone tells us

761
00:41:54,606 --> 00:41:56,432
that you're a doctor

762
00:41:56,436 --> 00:41:57,695
but also abnormal

763
00:41:57,696 --> 00:41:59,443
and homosexual?

764
00:41:59,696 --> 00:42:01,428
I am normal,

765
00:42:01,616 --> 00:42:05,136
and homosexuality is not wrong, either.

766
00:42:05,616 --> 00:42:07,536
Don't try to argue with me.

767
00:42:07,756 --> 00:42:09,805
Stop trying to control my life.

768
00:42:09,806 --> 00:42:10,895
I'm an adult now,

769
00:42:10,896 --> 00:42:12,323
and I'm of legal age.

770
00:42:12,326 --> 00:42:14,375
I have the right to do whatever I want.

771
00:42:14,376 --> 00:42:16,556
Please stop arguing.

772
00:42:16,776 --> 00:42:19,536
I don't want to argue,
but look at your daughter.

773
00:42:19,712 --> 00:42:23,896
How did you raise her
to be this disobedient?

774
00:42:24,032 --> 00:42:25,021
You're failing, too.

775
00:42:25,026 --> 00:42:26,435
Don't blame her.

776
00:42:26,436 --> 00:42:27,816
She hasn't done anything wrong.

777
00:42:28,192 --> 00:42:29,552
It's my fault.

778
00:42:29,556 --> 00:42:30,935
So you know you're wrong?

779
00:42:30,936 --> 00:42:32,556
So why keep doing it?

780
00:42:32,774 --> 00:42:33,656
It's my fault

781
00:42:33,988 --> 00:42:36,136
that I disobeyed you,

782
00:42:36,483 --> 00:42:38,774
but it's not my fault that I'm into women.

783
00:42:39,246 --> 00:42:40,575
I'm not getting married,

784
00:42:40,576 --> 00:42:43,806
and I will continue to love this woman,
no matter what.

785
00:42:44,536 --> 00:42:45,246
Prem...

786
00:42:45,377 --> 00:42:46,825
- Don't do that!
- Mother!

787
00:42:46,826 --> 00:42:47,416
Hey...

788
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:01,016
Don't look at me like that.

789
00:43:01,603 --> 00:43:02,736
I haven't done anything wrong.

790
00:43:03,996 --> 00:43:05,392
She deserved it

791
00:43:06,136 --> 00:43:08,536
as she fell short in her role as a mother.

792
00:43:15,276 --> 00:43:16,376
Mother...

793
00:43:21,176 --> 00:43:23,319
I'm sorry, Mother.

794
00:43:39,021 --> 00:43:42,032
I'm sorry for causing you pain, Mother.

795
00:43:49,181 --> 00:43:51,152
I can bear this little physical pain,

796
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:54,816
but the pain in my heart...

797
00:43:55,159 --> 00:43:57,159
I really can't bear it.

798
00:44:05,465 --> 00:44:06,456
Prem,

799
00:44:07,416 --> 00:44:10,136
will you obey what your father says, dear?

800
00:44:14,196 --> 00:44:17,736
I can't stand watching him
be harsh to you any longer.

801
00:44:22,294 --> 00:44:24,376
And I cannot accept...

802
00:44:26,076 --> 00:44:28,216
you being with that woman.

803
00:44:30,106 --> 00:44:32,136
I can endure everything else,

804
00:44:32,512 --> 00:44:35,901
but not really this one, dear.

805
00:44:43,276 --> 00:44:44,456
Please...

806
00:45:03,656 --> 00:45:05,096
Does this feel good?

807
00:45:06,056 --> 00:45:06,788
Yeah.

808
00:45:15,319 --> 00:45:16,136
Pat...

809
00:45:33,596 --> 00:45:35,166
Is everything okay, Prem?

810
00:45:35,814 --> 00:45:36,755
Why are you...

811
00:45:36,756 --> 00:45:38,176
making that face?

812
00:45:40,316 --> 00:45:42,614
Did anything happen

813
00:45:42,616 --> 00:45:43,936
when you visited your parents?

814
00:45:45,376 --> 00:45:47,296
Remember this, Pat...

815
00:45:52,279 --> 00:45:54,416
No matter what happens,

816
00:45:55,856 --> 00:45:57,712
whatever you might see

817
00:45:57,716 --> 00:45:59,216
or hear,

818
00:46:00,403 --> 00:46:02,576
I want you to trust me.

819
00:46:05,456 --> 00:46:08,243
My heart will always be only yours.

820
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:20,416
It's gonna be okay...

821
00:46:22,066 --> 00:46:23,566
my love.

822
00:46:26,656 --> 00:46:28,876
I'll always keep you close in my arms.

823
00:47:01,261 --> 00:47:03,085
Your parents asked me to give you a ride

824
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:04,701
to the hospital.

825
00:47:04,706 --> 00:47:06,376
I'm just letting you know first.

826
00:47:15,906 --> 00:47:17,776
See you in front of my condo.

827
00:48:41,101 --> 00:48:42,475
"Got an emergency patient.

828
00:48:42,476 --> 00:48:43,696
I gotta go now."

829
00:49:18,384 --> 00:49:19,154
Bow!

830
00:49:19,155 --> 00:49:20,100
What are you doing?

831
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:22,233
I was on duty all night.

832
00:49:22,234 --> 00:49:24,084
I missed you so bad, you know.

833
00:49:33,024 --> 00:49:34,158
Hey, stop.

834
00:49:36,144 --> 00:49:36,804
Bow...

835
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:39,564
What do you think I'm doing?

836
00:49:40,798 --> 00:49:42,244
What a dirty mind you have.

837
00:49:42,724 --> 00:49:45,724
I just wanted to hug you, Sita.

838
00:50:12,544 --> 00:50:13,271
Bow...

839
00:50:13,924 --> 00:50:15,844
I think you should pick it up.

840
00:50:16,173 --> 00:50:17,283
Just ignore it.

841
00:50:17,284 --> 00:50:18,724
They'll hang up soon.

842
00:50:22,744 --> 00:50:23,431
Bow!

843
00:50:24,151 --> 00:50:26,682
It could be an emergency patient, you know.

844
00:50:35,964 --> 00:50:36,724
What, Tan?

845
00:50:37,831 --> 00:50:38,500
Huh?

846
00:50:39,962 --> 00:50:41,911
You made me rush all the way here

847
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:43,524
just to eat porridge with you?

848
00:50:43,736 --> 00:50:44,964
Exactly.

849
00:50:45,053 --> 00:50:45,785
You know,

850
00:50:45,786 --> 00:50:46,993
it took me...

851
00:50:46,994 --> 00:50:48,324
a whole hour in line for this porridge.

852
00:50:48,644 --> 00:50:50,063
It's that good.

853
00:50:50,064 --> 00:50:51,394
It's legendary!

854
00:50:51,889 --> 00:50:53,164
Seriously...

855
00:50:53,374 --> 00:50:54,740
You're unbelievable.

856
00:50:55,084 --> 00:50:56,593
I haven't slept since last night, you know?

857
00:50:56,594 --> 00:50:57,484
Nope.

858
00:50:57,729 --> 00:50:59,162
That's all you've got to say?

859
00:50:59,404 --> 00:51:00,363
Relax, Bow.

860
00:51:00,364 --> 00:51:02,524
He waited so long to get it for us.

861
00:51:03,004 --> 00:51:04,033
Besides,

862
00:51:04,034 --> 00:51:05,364
I'm actually pretty hungry.

863
00:51:05,482 --> 00:51:06,638
Right, Sita?

864
00:51:06,804 --> 00:51:07,284
Come on.

865
00:51:07,285 --> 00:51:08,244
Let's eat.

866
00:51:08,849 --> 00:51:09,976
Not sure if Prem's here already.

867
00:51:09,977 --> 00:51:11,123
You should call her

868
00:51:11,124 --> 00:51:12,333
and make her join us.

869
00:51:13,314 --> 00:51:14,267
No need to do that.

870
00:51:14,484 --> 00:51:15,198
Look.

871
00:51:16,194 --> 00:51:17,242
I'll see you later.

872
00:51:24,682 --> 00:51:26,004
Who's that guy?

873
00:51:28,129 --> 00:51:29,133
And he's hot.

874
00:51:38,004 --> 00:51:38,667
Bow...

875
00:51:45,324 --> 00:51:45,940
Come here.

876
00:51:45,944 --> 00:51:47,244
Hurry and come.

877
00:51:48,958 --> 00:51:50,723
Who was that?

878
00:51:50,724 --> 00:51:52,164
Come on here.

879
00:51:54,084 --> 00:51:55,844
Who was that guy who gave you a ride?

880
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:57,404
And where's Pat?

881
00:51:57,947 --> 00:51:59,844
And why were you with him?

882
00:52:00,056 --> 00:52:00,804
Answer us.

883
00:52:00,805 --> 00:52:01,724
Say something.

884
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:07,204
Your parents are something else.

885
00:52:07,329 --> 00:52:09,604
They're straight out of a drama.

886
00:52:11,144 --> 00:52:14,164
Does Pat even know
you're being set up with him?

887
00:52:14,644 --> 00:52:15,783
She doesn't.

888
00:52:15,784 --> 00:52:16,427
What?

889
00:52:16,564 --> 00:52:18,004
Why didn't you tell her?

890
00:52:18,151 --> 00:52:20,444
If she finds out and takes it the wrong way,

891
00:52:21,064 --> 00:52:22,244
things could get messy, Prem.

892
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:24,644
I just don't know how to tell her.

893
00:52:24,813 --> 00:52:26,083
Just be honest with her.

894
00:52:26,084 --> 00:52:27,074
No need to cover it up.

895
00:52:27,874 --> 00:52:29,684
I agree with Bow, Prem.

896
00:52:30,164 --> 00:52:31,684
You're not doing anything wrong.

897
00:52:32,311 --> 00:52:34,093
As for your parents,

898
00:52:34,094 --> 00:52:35,918
just give them some time to calm down

899
00:52:36,294 --> 00:52:37,969
before talking things out.

900
00:52:38,364 --> 00:52:39,125
Right.

901
00:52:44,204 --> 00:52:45,438
Nothing to say?

902
00:52:48,394 --> 00:52:49,460
Good morning, Pat.

903
00:52:58,204 --> 00:53:00,834
I'm sorry I didn't tell you everything.

904
00:53:02,434 --> 00:53:03,758
It's totally okay.

905
00:53:04,129 --> 00:53:05,164
I understand.

906
00:53:06,024 --> 00:53:07,364
Is this why

907
00:53:07,613 --> 00:53:09,764
you asked me to trust you?

908
00:53:13,444 --> 00:53:15,613
I think we need to do something,

909
00:53:16,238 --> 00:53:18,044
so this kind of thing won't happen again.

910
00:53:18,524 --> 00:53:19,678
What are we gonna do?

911
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,980
I'll go talk to your parents.

912
00:53:33,104 --> 00:53:36,564
I'll earn their acceptance, no matter what.

913
00:53:42,004 --> 00:53:43,444
Mother, Father...

914
00:53:48,454 --> 00:53:49,467
This is Pat,

915
00:53:50,084 --> 00:53:51,524
my lover.

916
00:54:01,627 --> 00:54:02,284
Prem,

917
00:54:02,285 --> 00:54:04,204
come with me. I need to talk to you.

918
00:54:05,278 --> 00:54:06,762
You can talk right here.

919
00:54:08,524 --> 00:54:09,322
You sure?

920
00:54:09,605 --> 00:54:10,164
Yes.

921
00:54:11,809 --> 00:54:13,484
Because Prem and I...

922
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:16,204
don't keep secrets from each other.

923
00:54:20,522 --> 00:54:21,324
Fine.

924
00:54:22,005 --> 00:54:23,244
Then, I'll just be honest

925
00:54:23,889 --> 00:54:25,164
without holding back.

926
00:54:27,867 --> 00:54:29,163
Break up with Prem.

927
00:54:29,164 --> 00:54:30,449
Father!

928
00:54:31,194 --> 00:54:32,536
You're old enough.

929
00:54:33,404 --> 00:54:35,164
I hope I only need to say this once.

930
00:54:37,714 --> 00:54:38,980
I understand,

931
00:54:39,467 --> 00:54:40,444
but we're not breaking up.

932
00:54:40,924 --> 00:54:43,067
I'll never break up with Prem

933
00:54:43,524 --> 00:54:45,489
because we love each other.

934
00:54:46,107 --> 00:54:47,644
That word "love" again.

935
00:54:47,804 --> 00:54:49,243
I'm so sick of hearing it.

936
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:50,684
Can you quit saying it already?

937
00:54:50,994 --> 00:54:52,456
But it's true.

938
00:54:53,084 --> 00:54:54,523
Why can't I say what's true?

939
00:54:54,524 --> 00:54:55,483
Hey, you...

940
00:54:55,484 --> 00:54:56,924
I'm begging you.

941
00:54:57,569 --> 00:55:00,604
Please give us a chance,

942
00:55:00,834 --> 00:55:03,249
just one chance to love each other.

943
00:55:03,254 --> 00:55:04,724
There's no way that's possible.

944
00:55:06,078 --> 00:55:07,124
I won't allow it.

945
00:55:07,227 --> 00:55:08,563
You are breaking up now.

946
00:55:08,564 --> 00:55:09,684
This is my order.

947
00:55:10,718 --> 00:55:14,004
Our love is sincere and pure.

948
00:55:14,696 --> 00:55:17,004
We only wish the best for each other.

949
00:55:18,724 --> 00:55:21,124
I'm asking you
to give us a chance, Mother, Father.

950
00:55:21,453 --> 00:55:23,643
Please don't ask us
to end this love ever again.

951
00:55:23,644 --> 00:55:24,434
Stop.

952
00:55:25,084 --> 00:55:26,524
Don't you dare call me Father.

953
00:55:27,104 --> 00:55:28,274
I'm disgusted.

954
00:55:31,402 --> 00:55:32,529
That's enough, darling.

955
00:55:40,684 --> 00:55:41,598
Pat,

956
00:55:42,449 --> 00:55:44,684
I understand what you mean.

957
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:49,002
But please understand me, too, as a parent.

958
00:55:51,213 --> 00:55:52,964
I only have one daughter,

959
00:55:53,169 --> 00:55:55,169
and I can't bear to see her sad or disappointed

960
00:55:56,804 --> 00:55:59,518
if things don't turn out
the way she imagines.

961
00:56:00,454 --> 00:56:02,993
To me, this kind of love

962
00:56:02,994 --> 00:56:05,244
feels fleeting and unstable.

963
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:08,413
Maybe you and Prem
are just caught up in the moment.

964
00:56:08,604 --> 00:56:09,758
No, we're not.

965
00:56:10,689 --> 00:56:12,718
Every decision we made,

966
00:56:13,404 --> 00:56:15,324
we've thought it through carefully.

967
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:16,593
That's enough.

968
00:56:16,594 --> 00:56:17,664
Stop it already.

969
00:56:21,307 --> 00:56:22,958
Get out of here right now.

970
00:56:23,329 --> 00:56:24,233
Get out,

971
00:56:24,234 --> 00:56:25,453
and don't ever come back.

972
00:56:25,454 --> 00:56:27,363
You've brought shame on me

973
00:56:27,364 --> 00:56:29,644
and on this entire family!

974
00:56:35,294 --> 00:56:36,124
No,

975
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:37,213
I'm not leaving,

976
00:56:37,214 --> 00:56:39,003
not until you understand us.

977
00:56:39,004 --> 00:56:39,963
Never.

978
00:56:39,964 --> 00:56:41,278
That will never happen.

979
00:56:41,279 --> 00:56:42,324
Just leave.

980
00:56:44,544 --> 00:56:45,643
Get out!

981
00:56:45,644 --> 00:56:46,604
Now.

982
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:48,044
Pat...

983
00:56:49,707 --> 00:56:50,964
That's enough.

984
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:53,364
Let's go, shall we?

985
00:57:07,169 --> 00:57:08,604
I love Prem.

986
00:57:11,002 --> 00:57:14,244
I love her so much
that I can't live without her.

987
00:57:18,284 --> 00:57:21,924
All I ask is for you to give me a chance.

988
00:57:24,534 --> 00:57:26,049
And you'll see soon enough...

989
00:57:27,016 --> 00:57:28,295
that I can take care of her

990
00:57:28,296 --> 00:57:30,762
just as any man would care
for the woman he loves.
