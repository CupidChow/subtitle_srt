(Episode 6)

3
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:54,406
Shen... Shen Nan...

4
00:00:56,304 --> 00:00:57,679
There's no way

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,719
we can be together

6
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:02,773
now, right?

7
00:01:05,156 --> 00:01:06,439
No,

8
00:01:07,544 --> 00:01:08,601
no,

9
00:01:08,992 --> 00:01:11,343
we will always be together.

10
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:14,159
No one can stop us.

11
00:01:15,224 --> 00:01:16,344
Perhaps

12
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,719
this is

13
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:23,719
the arrangement of fate.

14
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,239
We can never

15
00:01:27,591 --> 00:01:29,728
be together.

16
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,162
Okay.

17
00:01:41,377 --> 00:01:43,479
Okay.

18
00:01:48,755 --> 00:01:50,354
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:50,593 --> 00:01:52,272
It's all my fault.

20
00:01:53,873 --> 00:01:55,538
It's all my fault.

21
00:02:26,076 --> 00:02:27,781
It's all my fault.

22
00:02:29,142 --> 00:02:30,711
It's all my fault.

23
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,439
Why?

24
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,439
Why?

25
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:42,175
Why wasn't it me who died?

26
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:47,334
Why?

27
00:02:47,537 --> 00:02:50,076
Why wasn't it me who died?

28
00:03:04,698 --> 00:03:06,016
Give me another chance.

29
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,423
As long as Shi Wen can come back to life,

30
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,805
I'll do anything you ask.

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,375
Give me another chance.

32
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,133
Warning. The electronic energy necklace

33
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,173
can only be used once.

34
00:03:20,474 --> 00:03:21,524
What chance?

35
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:22,758
Tell me.

36
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:24,248
Tell me.

37
00:03:24,446 --> 00:03:26,080
Tell me what chance.

38
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:27,982
As long as Shi Wen can come back to life,

39
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:29,334
I'll agree to anything.

40
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,601
I'm begging you to take me back!

41
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,751
Take me back!

42
00:03:37,026 --> 00:03:38,466
Please.

43
00:03:55,995 --> 00:03:57,074
Shi Wen.

44
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,057
Shi Wen.

45
00:04:05,056 --> 00:04:07,002
We can go back now, Shi Wen.

46
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:15,209
This time,

47
00:04:20,328 --> 00:04:22,289
I'll definitely control myself.

48
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:44,999
Strange...

49
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:47,289
What am I looking for?

50
00:04:47,823 --> 00:04:50,664
Why does my heart feel so empty?

51
00:05:02,195 --> 00:05:03,354
Shi Wen...

52
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:07,120
This is the last thing I can do for you.

53
00:05:08,113 --> 00:05:09,633
And I ask you, for me,

54
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,759
to never think of me again.

55
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,100
(Episode 6: Don't Look Back
Don't Look Back Don't Look Back)

56
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:27,456
(Outpatient Department)

57
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:32,917
Mr. Gu, your test results are out.

58
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,070
Your heart is very healthy.

59
00:05:34,095 --> 00:05:35,312
There's nothing wrong.

60
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,253
That's good.

61
00:05:37,776 --> 00:05:39,510
But, Doctor,

62
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,369
why do I always feel like

63
00:05:41,385 --> 00:05:43,065
my heart is heavy lately?

64
00:05:43,137 --> 00:05:46,418
Sometimes it even feels uncomfortable.

65
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,335
Just go home and rest more,
and you'll be fine.

66
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,596
Don't worry too much about it.

67
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:53,759
There's nothing else, right?

68
00:05:53,893 --> 00:05:55,471
No issues. Everything's fine.

69
00:05:55,496 --> 00:05:56,759
- Thanks for your help, doctor.
- Alright.

70
00:05:56,784 --> 00:05:57,822
- Thank you.
- Take care and get plenty of rest.

71
00:05:57,847 --> 00:05:58,878
Alright.

72
00:06:03,234 --> 00:06:04,934
Are you waiting in line?

73
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,720
I'm done, you can go in now.

74
00:06:07,146 --> 00:06:08,146
Oh.

75
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,654
Alright.

76
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,802
Wait.

77
00:06:14,115 --> 00:06:16,591
Have we met somewhere before?

78
00:06:20,553 --> 00:06:21,834
I don't think so.

79
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,169
It's my first time in this city.

80
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,695
Sorry,

81
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,639
I must've mistaken you for someone else.

82
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,703
When I was talking to

83
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:39,399
that person just now,

84
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,406
the feeling of heaviness and

85
00:06:41,422 --> 00:06:43,689
emptiness in my chest intensified.

86
00:06:44,302 --> 00:06:46,879
Forget it, I won't dwell on it.

87
00:06:46,943 --> 00:06:48,724
Better to follow the doctor's advice,

88
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,519
go home, and rest well.

89
00:06:58,593 --> 00:06:59,720
And you, miss?

90
00:06:59,814 --> 00:07:02,345
I'll have a matcha latte, please.

91
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:03,877
- Alright.
- Thank you.

92
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,635
Matcha latte.

93
00:07:05,682 --> 00:07:06,854
Would you like it hot or iced?

94
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,456
- Iced, please.
- Got it.

95
00:07:08,676 --> 00:07:10,971
Did you ask for some napkins earlier?

96
00:07:11,292 --> 00:07:12,690
Anything else you need?

97
00:07:12,715 --> 00:07:14,401
- Not for now.
- Alright.

98
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,808
Also,

99
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,396
our special drink here is quite good.

100
00:07:18,412 --> 00:07:19,678
Would you like to try it?

101
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,800
Hello.

102
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,240
Hello.

103
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,360
It's you.

104
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,620
Are you here for a drink or to stay?

105
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,040
I'm waiting for a friend.

106
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,439
They're not coming today now.

107
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,925
So, I'm leaving now.

108
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,599
Stay for a coffee before you go.

109
00:07:56,928 --> 00:07:57,928
It's on me.

110
00:07:58,164 --> 00:07:59,438
Let's call it fate bringing us

111
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:00,461
together twice.

112
00:08:01,058 --> 00:08:02,058
Mm.

113
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,559
What's wrong?

114
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,322
Thanks for the coffee.

115
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,159
Boss.

116
00:09:51,184 --> 00:09:52,519
I'm coming.

117
00:09:52,544 --> 00:09:53,970
Come back if you liked it!

118
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,227
Help me out.

119
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:17,824
I almost meddled unnecessarily.

120
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,913
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

121
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,840
Dear Mr. Gu,

122
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,200
By the time you read this letter,

123
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,476
let me first wish you a happy birthday.

124
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,445
You might feel confused.

125
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,399
Who is writing this letter?

126
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,240
My identity is not important.

127
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,879
You just need to know

128
00:12:36,543 --> 00:12:38,503
that the words below represent

129
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:40,929
my sincerest blessings to you.

130
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,320
I want to tell you

131
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,523
that you are a truly talented artist.

132
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,882
Your paintings

133
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:52,480
are filled with life and emotion.

134
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,679
Every stroke,

135
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,200
every painting,

136
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:00,200
seems to tell a touching story.

137
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,906
Perhaps those stories don't include me.

138
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:08,336
Even as your memories blur,

139
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,593
those memories will not disappear.

140
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,351
I will cherish them in my mind alone.

141
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,279
At the same time,

142
00:13:19,551 --> 00:13:22,679
I wish for you to live a happy life.

143
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:26,519
Perhaps you've found new love,

144
00:13:26,903 --> 00:13:28,333
or perhaps you are enjoying

145
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,379
your time alone.

146
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,679
But no matter what,

147
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,936
I hope you maintain a grateful heart.

148
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,669
Cherish every bit of warmth

149
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:39,872
and love around you.

150
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,279
If someone appears who

151
00:13:43,303 --> 00:13:44,983
makes your heart race,

152
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,919
don't hesitate to love them.

153
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,842
You've lost too much.

154
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:52,120
In the days ahead,

155
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,874
I hope you keep gaining more and more.

156
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:59,858
As I write these blessings,

157
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,577
I feel both joy and sorrow.

158
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,440
Because I know,

159
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,428
these wishes might mean

160
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:11,559
nothing to you,

161
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,639
only confusion.

162
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,759
Don't be confused.

163
00:14:17,686 --> 00:14:19,420
If this warm letter

164
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,068
can bring you

165
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:23,084
a touch of warmth in winter,

166
00:14:24,616 --> 00:14:25,764
then it's enough.

167
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:28,720
Finally,

168
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,559
I want to say one thing to you.

169
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,320
Thank you.

170
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,226
Thank you for stepping into my life,

171
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:40,781
bringing them

172
00:14:40,806 --> 00:14:42,606
so much laughter and tears.

173
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,366
May you, in the days to come,

174
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,720
gain more

175
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,734
happiness and success.

176
00:14:54,109 --> 00:14:56,335
(Sender)
(A non-existent passerby)

177
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,134
Hello.

178
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,415
Could you replace the packaging

179
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,714
of these items with a birthday gift box?

180
00:15:06,816 --> 00:15:08,339
I'll cover any additional costs.

181
00:15:08,364 --> 00:15:09,695
We haven't done that before,

182
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,427
but I can try.

183
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,637
Great, thank you.

184
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,575
It seems your friend

185
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,280
really loves painting.

186
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:18,708
Yes.

187
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,981
He's an amazing artist.

188
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,403
I hope he'll like these.

189
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:27,255
Shen Nan.

190
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,669
You're here too?

191
00:15:30,576 --> 00:15:31,815
With exams approaching,

192
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,559
I'm getting a new set of art supplies.

193
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:35,360
Let me help you choose.

194
00:15:35,488 --> 00:15:36,488
This one.

195
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:39,559
This one.

196
00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:42,689
Sir,

197
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,699
your items are packed.

198
00:15:46,057 --> 00:15:47,057
Thank you.

199
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,198
(Slow delivery)

200
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,331
Hello,

201
00:16:05,356 --> 00:16:06,512
these gifts and letters

202
00:16:06,536 --> 00:16:07,495
are very important.

203
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,134
I've organized them into ten sets.

204
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:11,254
Please make sure they're delivered

205
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,666
on this day every year

206
00:16:12,675 --> 00:16:14,056
for the next ten years.

207
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,565
We'll ensure timely delivery

208
00:16:15,581 --> 00:16:16,941
as you requested.

209
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:19,759
Thank you.

210
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,518
It's raining. Take an umbrella.

211
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,320
Thank you.

212
00:17:40,212 --> 00:17:42,212
(Dental room 1)

213
00:17:43,985 --> 00:17:45,454
- Hey Shen Nan,
- Huh?

214
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,712
your dark circles are almost panda-like.

215
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,680
Still having insomnia?

216
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:53,376
Haa...

217
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,839
I've been to so many hospitals,

218
00:17:55,023 --> 00:17:56,223
taken so much medication,

219
00:17:56,361 --> 00:17:58,024
but nothing works.

220
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,509
I heard,

221
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,774
in a small town in the south,

222
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:03,891
there's a retired old

223
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,193
Chinese medicine doctor

224
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,602
called Grandma Yu.

225
00:18:07,848 --> 00:18:09,630
She's cured a lot of difficult illnesses

226
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:10,655
in the past.

227
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,000
But now she's old

228
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,415
and no longer sees patients.

229
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,821
Really?

230
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,891
Then it seems

231
00:18:17,993 --> 00:18:19,727
it's time to persuade her to

232
00:18:19,735 --> 00:18:21,376
come out of retirement.

233
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,539
Go give it a shot.

234
00:18:22,548 --> 00:18:24,016
Better than doing nothing.

235
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,360
I'll cover your work for a while.

236
00:18:27,377 --> 00:18:28,649
Thanks, man.

237
00:18:29,665 --> 00:18:30,673
Awesome.

238
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,160
Hello,

239
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,986
are you Grandma Yu?

240
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
Leave.

241
00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:45,736
I've stopped practicing medicine.

242
00:19:47,615 --> 00:19:48,615
Grandma Yu,

243
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,982
if you can cure my illness,

244
00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:51,674
I'm willing to pay any amount.

245
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,680
Go away, go away.

246
00:19:55,705 --> 00:19:56,890
- Please listen to me.
- Leave now.

247
00:19:56,906 --> 00:19:58,210
- That's not what I meant.
- Leave.

248
00:19:58,234 --> 00:20:00,800
- I need your help with something.
- Go away, go away.

249
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:12,455
Who told you to laugh?

250
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:16,241
Do you know

251
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:18,784
why I won't treat you?

252
00:20:18,971 --> 00:20:20,056
I should have shown

253
00:20:20,073 --> 00:20:21,416
my sincerity by paying first,

254
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,925
not just talking about it.

255
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,135
It's because you're not

256
00:20:26,151 --> 00:20:27,260
telling the truth.

257
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,346
You say your illness is insomnia,

258
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,464
but that's not it at all.

259
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:35,776
You're constantly

260
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,776
thinking about someone.

261
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,135
Grandma Yu, how did you know?

262
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:45,948
That's not important.

263
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,565
What's important is

264
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,800
young man,

265
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:54,000
your illness isn't something I can cure.

266
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,920
But Grandma Yu,

267
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:59,971
I heard you've cured many patients.

268
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,995
Please, I beg you, help me.

269
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,120
For the past six months,

270
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,019
I've only been sleeping two

271
00:21:07,035 --> 00:21:08,198
or three hours a day.

272
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:10,640
Alright.

273
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:13,135
I'll give you a method.

274
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,393
Whether it cures your heartache or not

275
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:17,885
depends on your own fate.

276
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:20,885
Thank you, Grandma Yu. Please, tell me.

277
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:23,079
Child,

278
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:27,034
you've endured too much pain.

279
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,143
If you truly wish to forget them,

280
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,503
you must not only

281
00:21:32,528 --> 00:21:34,261
continue thinking of them,

282
00:21:34,345 --> 00:21:36,113
but also revisit the places where

283
00:21:36,137 --> 00:21:37,870
you once loved each other,

284
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,565
eat the food you once shared,

285
00:21:40,672 --> 00:21:42,117
and walk the paths

286
00:21:42,142 --> 00:21:43,822
you once walked together.

287
00:21:44,343 --> 00:21:48,362
You must confront all those memories

288
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,079
the mundane, the joyful, the painful.

289
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:53,718
In the end, the answer

290
00:21:53,743 --> 00:21:55,289
will naturally reveal itself.

291
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,240
But...

292
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,159
I'm afraid.

293
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:03,120
I'm scared I can't handle it.

294
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,400
Give it a try.

295
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,393
I understand now.

296
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:13,885
Thank you, Grandma Yu.

297
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:56,200
Alright, let me arrange these.

298
00:22:56,225 --> 00:22:57,436
Make them a little neater.

299
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:01,499
Brother, the weather's nice today.

300
00:23:01,522 --> 00:23:02,535
Take some photos of me.

301
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,734
- Look at the newly bought peaches.
- Sure, but I'm not doing any editing.

302
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:06,014
I'll edit them myself.

303
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:07,319
- Alright.
- Not many people here.

304
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,639
Alright, three, two, one.

305
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,215
Let's move to another spot.

306
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,240
Three, two, one.

307
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:17,819
- Come look.
- Let me see.

308
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:25,519
What's this?

309
00:23:25,543 --> 00:23:27,200
You made me look so fat!

310
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:29,764
I think it's okay.

311
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:31,202
Let me see.

312
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,375
It looks good to me.

313
00:23:37,408 --> 00:23:39,663
He made me look this short.

314
00:23:39,872 --> 00:23:41,429
Let me try taking one of you.

315
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:42,695
Alright, Shen Nan.

316
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,534
You always use me, it's your turn.

317
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,030
Fine, let me take one.

318
00:23:46,273 --> 00:23:47,499
- Shen Nan.
- Come here.

319
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,352
You three, sit here.

320
00:23:49,376 --> 00:23:50,401
I'll take a group photo of you.

321
00:23:50,425 --> 00:23:51,734
- Sure.
- Let me grab a prop.

322
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:56,240
Alright. Three, two, one.

323
00:23:56,929 --> 00:23:58,327
Change your pose.

324
00:24:11,376 --> 00:24:12,646
How's this?

325
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,084
What?

326
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,559
You focused entirely on Shi Wen.

327
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:19,615
No. You...

328
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,774
Aren't you right there?

329
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:21,935
You're sneaking photos of him.

330
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,100
- I didn't.
- You totally did.

331
00:24:25,827 --> 00:24:27,799
Huh? Where's Shi Wen?

332
00:24:27,888 --> 00:24:29,427
Where did he go?

333
00:24:29,944 --> 00:24:31,763
You two keep shooting.
I'll go find him.

334
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:32,814
Alright, let's continue.

335
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,178
I'll take the next ones.

336
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,039
I'll do it myself.

337
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,400
Go and embrace you.

338
00:24:42,766 --> 00:24:48,326
Don't let memories turn into a game.

339
00:25:22,351 --> 00:25:24,351
You took photos of me?

340
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,471
Were you secretly photographing me?

341
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,039
I wasn't.

342
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:32,734
Yes. I was taking pictures.

343
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:34,254
But I was capturing the scenery.

344
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:36,385
Look at these trees.

345
00:25:37,017 --> 00:25:38,361
And the sky,

346
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:39,580
it's quite beautiful.

347
00:25:39,969 --> 00:25:41,564
Keep taking pictures, then.

348
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Sure.

349
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,402
Brother, this place is beautiful!

350
00:26:09,957 --> 00:26:11,707
Look at the ducks over there!

351
00:26:11,732 --> 00:26:12,855
Ducks?

352
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,000
There are fish too.

353
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,910
This one is so big!

354
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,191
What were you taking pictures of?

355
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:28,759
Nothing.

356
00:26:29,615 --> 00:26:30,615
Let me see.

357
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,920
- It's nothing, really.
- Let me see.

358
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,574
- It's really nothing.
- Come on, let me see.

359
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:34,788
- It's nothing.
- Shi Wen, come here!

360
00:26:34,812 --> 00:26:36,491
There are mushrooms over here!

361
00:26:38,703 --> 00:26:39,703
Coming!

362
00:27:04,969 --> 00:27:06,000
What were you taking pictures of?

363
00:27:06,008 --> 00:27:07,008
Let me see.

364
00:27:07,443 --> 00:27:08,455
- The camera...
- Umm...

365
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,400
Oh no, what do I do?

366
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:11,838
Quick, get some water!

367
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:12,895
Go!

368
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,920
I...

369
00:27:17,589 --> 00:27:19,248
Hey! Are you crazy?

370
00:27:19,317 --> 00:27:21,993
- But the camera...
- Just buy a new one!

371
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,160
Don't be sad anymore.

372
00:27:42,425 --> 00:27:44,609
I told you, just buy a new one.

373
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,250
You don't understand.

374
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,094
It's not about the camera.

375
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:52,494
When we get a new one,

376
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:54,594
we can just go on another outing.

377
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,814
I'll eat another sandwich,

378
00:27:57,839 --> 00:27:59,175
sing that song again,

379
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,510
and revisit all the places

380
00:28:00,535 --> 00:28:01,735
we went before.

381
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,774
So you knew all along.

382
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:07,814
Uh, well, I'm feeling a bit sleepy

383
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:09,766
I'll head to bed. Goodnight.

384
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:00,799
Sorry, I'm late.

385
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:03,004
Why did you ask me to come here?

386
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:07,720
This is for you.

387
00:29:08,152 --> 00:29:10,083
Your camera broke, didn't it?

388
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,825
A camera?

389
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:16,528
It's a pity about the old photos.

390
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:23,920
What?

391
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,692
The memory card. Can't you tell?

392
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:34,200
Isn't this already...

393
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,622
I picked it out when I was

394
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,301
cleaning the fire pit that day.

395
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,169
But I don't know if it's broken.

396
00:29:39,185 --> 00:29:40,997
I haven't checked it in the camera.

397
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:58,319
Thanks.

398
00:30:00,487 --> 00:30:01,734
Let me take your photo.

399
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:02,763
Okay.

400
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,256
Looks great, looks great.

401
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:53,279
- Happy birthday to you.
- Happy birthday to you.

402
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,440
- Happy birthday to you.
- Happy birthday to you.

403
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:00,359
- Happy birthday to you.
- Happy birthday to you.

404
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,000
- Happy birthday to you.
- Happy birthday to you.

405
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:07,480
- Happy birthday to you. - Happy birthday to you.
- Happy birthday to you.

406
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,976
Hurry, hurry, make a wish.

407
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,780
It's been so long since
I celebrated a birthday.

408
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,895
Thank you, everyone.

409
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,390
- Make your wish quickly.
- Mm.

410
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:20,734
Let's all make a wish together.

411
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:22,382
Come on, come on, everyone together.

412
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,680
I wish...

413
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:32,500
For Gu Shi Wen's wish to come true.

414
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:34,839
I wish...

415
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,883
To be with Shen Nan forever.

416
00:31:54,016 --> 00:31:55,495
Let's blow out the candles together.

417
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,839
- Three, two, one...
- Three, two, one...

418
00:32:00,144 --> 00:32:01,562
Happy Birthday!

419
00:32:01,603 --> 00:32:02,785
Happy Birthday!

420
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:06,359
- Cheers!
- Cheers! Cheers!

421
00:32:06,414 --> 00:32:08,414
- Cheers!
- Cheers! Cheers!

422
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,119
If only my paintings

423
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,280
could have such rich colors.

424
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:13,794
Even though I don't know much

425
00:33:13,802 --> 00:33:14,775
about painting,

426
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,148
I believe that even without many colors,

427
00:33:18,593 --> 00:33:21,405
a painting can still be moving.

428
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,007
Maybe I'll never truly feel it.

429
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:27,616
Everyone, come over here to take a look.

430
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:00,240
A painting, like a person,

431
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:02,398
Has different ways of

432
00:34:02,423 --> 00:34:04,406
expressing emotions.

433
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,319
Perhaps.

434
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,960
Maybe

435
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,993
I've been too shallow.

436
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,190
Are all of these gifts from you?

437
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,719
I always thought

438
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,041
that I was the only one

439
00:35:06,065 --> 00:35:07,362
quietly documenting you.

440
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,631
I didn't realize you were

441
00:35:12,647 --> 00:35:13,686
responding to me, too.

442
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,408
“OK” just means no problem.

443
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:30,627
Not just that.

444
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,928
The “OK” hand gesture

445
00:36:31,944 --> 00:36:33,296
has another meaning.

446
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,455
What meaning?

447
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,986
You don't know, right?

448
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,900
It means “I love you.”

449
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:41,047
Then I'd better be careful

450
00:36:41,063 --> 00:36:42,406
about using that gesture.

451
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:42,100
As long as you love each other,

452
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,944
he will pass away for some reason.

453
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,960
If you love him...

454
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:51,880
Then please place that love

455
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:56,405
where he cannot see it.

456
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,460
As long as he lives well...

457
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:05,839
That's enough.

458
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,951
Dear Mr. Gu Shi Wen,

459
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,334
Happy Birthday.

460
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:29,303
Bathed in sunlight,

461
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:31,461
The pen in my hand hesitates

462
00:39:31,486 --> 00:39:32,606
on the paper.

463
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,389
I have no creative skills like you do.

464
00:39:37,605 --> 00:39:39,552
I can only, with sorrow,

465
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,760
think of your face.

466
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,440
At this moment, I...

467
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:47,800
I can only touch the colors

468
00:39:47,808 --> 00:39:49,675
you once had with memories.

469
00:39:51,258 --> 00:39:53,685
Is your paintbrush still waving?

470
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:57,047
Is your world still warm?

471
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,254
Our distance is

472
00:40:00,278 --> 00:40:03,094
now an insurmountable gap.

473
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,900
I often can't help but want to

474
00:40:04,925 --> 00:40:06,045
approach you,

475
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:09,559
but am pushed away by the cruel reality.

476
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:12,391
I miss your smile,

477
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:15,079
I miss your voice,

478
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,679
I miss your focused expression

479
00:40:17,704 --> 00:40:18,765
when you painted.

480
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,078
But now...

481
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:23,195
These only become

482
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,586
the torment in my heart.

483
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,859
I have imagined countless times

484
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:28,320
the scene of our reunion.

485
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,480
I know...

486
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,679
You are pursuing your dreams.

487
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:35,414
Do you know?

488
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,119
Every time I pass those places

489
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:39,815
we used to walk together,

490
00:40:40,602 --> 00:40:43,406
(Please accept good luck)
The corners where our footprints remain,

491
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,649
I can't help but stop walking

492
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,703
and trying to find your shadow.

493
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,559
But each time...

494
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,313
It only deepens the feeling

495
00:40:55,321 --> 00:40:56,841
of your departure.

496
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,969
I try to numb myself with busyness,

497
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:03,360
But every time late at night,

498
00:41:04,287 --> 00:41:06,102
The memories of you...

499
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,578
Rush in like the tide.

500
00:41:08,643 --> 00:41:10,614
Breathing feels as painful as surgery.

501
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:12,180
- I want to tell you,
- I want to tell you,

502
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,320
- I really miss you.
- I really miss you.

503
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:19,231
- But I can't cross that vast distance
- But I can't cross that vast distance

504
00:41:19,255 --> 00:41:21,149
- to embrace you.
- to embrace you.

505
00:41:21,606 --> 00:41:23,125
- Please forgive me.
- Please forgive me.

506
00:41:23,623 --> 00:41:25,514
For not being able to bring you

507
00:41:25,539 --> 00:41:27,219
more warmth and comfort.

508
00:41:28,061 --> 00:41:30,110
- I can only, in this letter,
- I can only, in this letter,

509
00:41:30,222 --> 00:41:33,394
- write all my sorrow and
- write all my sorrow and

510
00:41:33,418 --> 00:41:35,538
- longing for you in these words.
- longing for you in these words.

511
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,912
- May you, on the road to
- May you, on the road to

512
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:39,141
- pursuing your dreams,
- pursuing your dreams,

513
00:41:39,165 --> 00:41:41,895
- I'll always silently praying for you
- I'll always silently praying for you

514
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,670
- and offering blessings
- and offering blessings

515
00:41:43,686 --> 00:41:45,419
- from where you cannot see.
- from where you cannot see.

516
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,781
- Sender,
- Sender,

517
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,670
- a non-existent passerby.
- a non-existent passerby.

518
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:52,928
Why does a figure

519
00:42:52,944 --> 00:42:54,677
keep appearing in my mind?

520
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,214
Did I forget someone?

521
00:42:57,239 --> 00:42:59,094
You greet so many guests every day,

522
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,592
it's normal to forget people.

523
00:43:06,061 --> 00:43:07,061
Hello.

524
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,770
Why him?

525
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,753
Oh my, a big truck is so scary!

526
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,614
Big trucks don't know to
yield to pedestrians.

527
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:43,187
Luckily, the person is fine.

528
00:45:43,578 --> 00:45:44,599
As long as the person's okay.

529
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:46,102
The green light's on, let's go.

530
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:19,794
Is it really worth it to protect someone

531
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,325
with all your strength?

532
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:24,466
Yes.

533
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,300
(If we are destined to part, )

534
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,059
(then what is the meaning
of our meeting?)
