(Episode 1: Becoming "Family" with the
Person Who Knocked Me Over)

3
00:00:47,825 --> 00:00:48,950
Putting all your effort

4
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,238
into protecting someone,

5
00:00:50,262 --> 00:00:51,815
is it really worth it?

6
00:01:04,274 --> 00:01:06,479
Driver, can you slow down a bit?

7
00:02:22,794 --> 00:02:24,700
Hey, hey, hey.

8
00:02:30,606 --> 00:02:31,606
Umm...

9
00:02:31,976 --> 00:02:33,382
You don't look at traffic lights

10
00:02:33,406 --> 00:02:34,352
when crossing the road?

11
00:02:34,376 --> 00:02:35,887
Sorry! Really, I'm so sorry.

12
00:02:35,912 --> 00:02:37,121
Are you okay?

13
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,082
Hey, that's...

14
00:02:44,705 --> 00:02:45,728
Here.

15
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:50,675
What are you doing?

16
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,533
Are you treating me like a child?

17
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:54,072
You...

18
00:02:56,245 --> 00:02:57,909
Take it or leave it. I'm in a hurry,

19
00:02:57,934 --> 00:02:59,294
I'm leaving now.

20
00:03:00,661 --> 00:03:01,776
Hey.

21
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,942
What are you doing?

22
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:04,270
Hit and run?

23
00:03:04,295 --> 00:03:06,832
Don't leave! You hit people and... Oww.

24
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,640
(marriage certificate)

25
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,145
This is why you urgently

26
00:03:25,153 --> 00:03:26,458
called me back, Dad?

27
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,116
Your mom left us so many years ago.

28
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,895
You've grown up, gotten your own job.

29
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,775
And I, at my age,

30
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,663
should start enjoying a new life.

31
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,150
Give me a break.

32
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,094
All you did was pay my tuition.

33
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:42,295
You barely took care of me otherwise.

34
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,376
Now you're acting like
you're kind hearted.

35
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:45,751
You brat!

36
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:47,611
Now that you can rely on yourself,

37
00:03:47,619 --> 00:03:48,892
you're talking to me like this?

38
00:03:49,641 --> 00:03:51,509
If I hadn't been doing business outside,

39
00:03:51,534 --> 00:03:52,962
how would I have raised you?

40
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:54,470
Yeah, yeah,

41
00:03:54,624 --> 00:03:55,884
I know, Dad.

42
00:04:01,854 --> 00:04:02,939
Dad.

43
00:04:03,072 --> 00:04:04,603
You're really lucky.

44
00:04:04,687 --> 00:04:06,431
Auntie takes very good care
of this place.

45
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:07,615
Your auntie,

46
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,478
she takes very good care of me.

47
00:04:10,095 --> 00:04:11,828
Tomorrow, our families will'
have a meal together.

48
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,521
From now on, we'll be one family.

49
00:04:13,546 --> 00:04:15,084
- Mm.
- Oh, right.

50
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:16,294
Your auntie has a son.

51
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,734
He's a few years younger than you,

52
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,969
but I hope you two can

53
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:20,256
become good friends.

54
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,281
Alright.

55
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,750
Okay, let's go.

56
00:04:28,486 --> 00:04:30,132
Son, come here.

57
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:32,773
This is your auntie.

58
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,578
Hello, Auntie.

59
00:04:36,136 --> 00:04:37,750
- So, you're Shen Nan?
- Yes.

60
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,390
Make yourself at home, don't be shy.

61
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,492
Alright.

62
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,718
Here, let me help you.

63
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,487
Why is it you?

64
00:04:55,616 --> 00:04:56,784
Who are you?

65
00:04:56,809 --> 00:04:57,895
Oh, Shen Nan.

66
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,232
I forgot to introduce him.

67
00:04:59,248 --> 00:05:00,456
This is my son, Shi Wen.

68
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,865
From now on, you two will be

69
00:05:01,881 --> 00:05:03,256
good friends and brothers.

70
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,198
Take care of each other.

71
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,557
Hit and run.

72
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,135
Let's see how I'll deal with you.

73
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,094
Tomorrow evening is the family dinner.
It'll be very busy at home.

74
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:14,128
We've invited many

75
00:05:14,144 --> 00:05:15,055
relatives and friends.

76
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,902
You're the older brother, help Shi Wen

77
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,167
when the time comes.

78
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,416
Don't worry, Auntie.

79
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,838
Hello, little brother.

80
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,440
I'm Shen Nan.

81
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,948
Who's your little brother?

82
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,705
Don't try to claim connections.

83
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:04,385
Congratulations on the wedding!

84
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,931
Thank you, thank you, everyone.

85
00:06:05,947 --> 00:06:07,307
Come, let's drink.

86
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,901
- Congratulations on the wedding!
- Thank you.

87
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:16,729
Please, sit down. Eat and drink
as much as you like.

88
00:06:16,754 --> 00:06:17,823
Yes, yes.

89
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,276
Ladies, gentlemen, and elders.

90
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,244
This is my younger brother, Gu Shi Wen.

91
00:06:27,581 --> 00:06:28,776
Oh my.

92
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,344
Couldn't tell at all.

93
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:31,689
You two have a great

94
00:06:31,697 --> 00:06:33,175
brotherly relationship!

95
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:35,759
Of course! I adore him.

96
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,463
Come on, call me “Brother”!

97
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,854
I won't call you that.

98
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,463
Everyone's waiting.

99
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:44,520
- Say it.
- Say it.

100
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,213
- Say it.
- Say it.

101
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,981
Don't be shy. We're all family now,

102
00:06:47,997 --> 00:06:48,997
just say it.

103
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,455
Big brother.

104
00:06:50,487 --> 00:06:52,283
That's more like it!

105
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,214
Shi Wen, let me tell you.

106
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:57,194
This kid Nan,
he has a great personality!

107
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:00,026
You two need to get along well.

108
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,078
Don't worry, as the older brother,

109
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:04,485
I'll definitely take care of you,

110
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:05,399
little brother.

111
00:07:05,423 --> 00:07:06,705
That's the spirit!

112
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:08,884
Brothers united, unstoppable together!

113
00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:10,104
- Right!
- Right!

114
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,198
No need to feel shy.

115
00:07:12,392 --> 00:07:14,096
- We're family now.
- Okay, thank you.

116
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,041
Here, brother.

117
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,135
Eat more.

118
00:07:23,164 --> 00:07:25,614
When it's hot, eat more chili.

119
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,404
It helps drive out the cold and

120
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,936
reduce internal heat.

121
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,131
Here, eat more,

122
00:07:30,147 --> 00:07:31,959
have another spoonful of this.

123
00:07:33,841 --> 00:07:34,984
Cheers!

124
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:36,765
Big brother.

125
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,546
Son, Your aunt and I

126
00:08:09,562 --> 00:08:11,215
are going on our honeymoon.

127
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:12,491
You and Shi Wen need to

128
00:08:12,507 --> 00:08:13,889
get along at home, okay?

129
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:18,685
Haa... I have nothing to say
to dad and others.

130
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,495
I have something to do today,
need to go out.

131
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,747
The café will be left to you to manage.

132
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,637
Where are you? I'll come find you.

133
00:08:29,662 --> 00:08:31,342
Send me the location.

134
00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:41,794
Oh my gosh!

135
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:44,199
This café is so pretty!

136
00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:45,771
It really is nice.

137
00:08:46,146 --> 00:08:47,825
Take a look around.

138
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,349
Hello, what would you two like to drink?

139
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:53,217
I'll have an iced latte

140
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:54,825
add milk and sugar.

141
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,255
Alright.

142
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,021
I'll take an Americano.

143
00:08:59,046 --> 00:09:00,072
Got it.

144
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,755
Wait a second, don't add the sugar.

145
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,864
I just remembered I'm on a diet.

146
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,375
Alright, understood.

147
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,661
Oh, and I brought this super kawaii cup.

148
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,700
Could you use it for my drink?

149
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,052
Sure.

150
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:17,982
Wait a second.

151
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:19,574
Actually, skip the milk too.

152
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:20,685
I just remembered

153
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,404
I'm lactose intolerant.

154
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,286
Got it.

155
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:28,495
Maybe skip the ice too. After all...

156
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,317
Why not skip the coffee altogether?

157
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:32,872
Good idea. Just get me a glass of water.

158
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,372
Alright.

159
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:37,521
Oh, by the way,

160
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,317
The material of your cup,

161
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:41,013
does it have any temperature limits?

162
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,135
No, no.

163
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,200
Anything under 100°C is fine.

164
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:46,177
Alright, please wait a moment.

165
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,692
Hello. Here's your plain water.

166
00:09:57,319 --> 00:09:58,849
And your Americano.

167
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,200
It's scalding!

168
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,786
I think the temperature is way too high!

169
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,700
You've ruined my cup!

170
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,350
That's why I asked you earlier how much

171
00:10:09,366 --> 00:10:10,935
heat your cup could handle.

172
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,475
This Americano's temperature

173
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:13,935
is around 80 to 90°C.

174
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:15,763
No, no, no. This is wrong.

175
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,294
You've damaged my cup! Look! Look!

176
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:19,975
There's even a crack here.
Can't you see?

177
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,028
The coffee's leaking out!

178
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,174
You need to pay!

179
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:24,628
Wow, there really is a crack.

180
00:10:24,644 --> 00:10:25,598
You should pay.

181
00:10:25,623 --> 00:10:26,956
But I did ask you earlier.

182
00:10:26,981 --> 00:10:28,369
You said the cup was fine.

183
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,975
That's why I made your coffee.

184
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,135
- Now you're saying the cup...
- What kind of attitude is that?

185
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,333
I'm going to file a complaint!

186
00:10:33,358 --> 00:10:34,735
Your service is terrible!

187
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,869
I ordered coffee, and you

188
00:10:35,877 --> 00:10:36,825
just gave me water.

189
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:37,911
Exactly!

190
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,545
You two are really working

191
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,574
in tandem here.

192
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,654
I think you're not here for coffee.

193
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,653
You're here to make trouble, aren't you?

194
00:10:51,802 --> 00:10:53,255
We're not drinking anymore.

195
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,450
What kind of service attitude is this?

196
00:10:57,767 --> 00:10:59,121
Hey, wait a second!

197
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,036
You haven't paid yet!

198
00:11:18,359 --> 00:11:19,496
Gu Shi Wen!

199
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,814
Those two people from this afternoon,

200
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:22,960
did you send them to mess

201
00:11:22,968 --> 00:11:24,096
with me on purpose?

202
00:11:24,128 --> 00:11:26,129
I really didn't expect it!

203
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:28,763
You're so young and look gentle,

204
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,683
how can you be so devious?

205
00:11:31,727 --> 00:11:32,754
Gu Shi Wen!

206
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,324
I'm talking to you, are you listening?

207
00:11:36,511 --> 00:11:37,714
Gu Shi Wen!

208
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,393
Gu Shi Wen!

209
00:12:00,384 --> 00:12:01,486
You have a fever!

210
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,768
No!

211
00:12:02,953 --> 00:12:06,018
I didn't mean to! Don't hit Mom!

212
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,955
No, I didn't mean to!

213
00:12:09,057 --> 00:12:10,127
No.

214
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:13,276
Don't go!

215
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,549
I won't go.

216
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,237
I won't go.

217
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:43,940
I won't go.

218
00:13:26,327 --> 00:13:27,781
Still burning up.

219
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,681
This won't do.

220
00:13:29,961 --> 00:13:31,735
I have to take you to the hospital.

221
00:13:39,936 --> 00:13:41,016
No need to rush.

222
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,641
We'll be at the hospital soon.

223
00:13:45,944 --> 00:13:47,484
Doctor! Doctor!

224
00:13:47,585 --> 00:13:49,571
He has a fever! Please check him!

225
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:51,993
Come in quickly.

226
00:13:52,072 --> 00:13:56,102
(Jiangjin City Clinic, Longchuan County)

227
00:13:56,911 --> 00:13:59,782
Doctor, how is he?

228
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,281
It's a high fever caused

229
00:14:02,297 --> 00:14:03,897
by gum inflammation.

230
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,101
We'll start with IV fluids

231
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,216
to reduce the fever.

232
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,814
I'll prescribe some
anti-inflammatory medication.

233
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,681
- Alright.
- Let me know when you're ready.

234
00:14:09,706 --> 00:14:10,706
Mm.

235
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,045
Water.

236
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,545
I want water.

237
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,100
- It's hot?
- Too hot!

238
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,959
Okay, it's ready.

239
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:20,319
Thank you.

240
00:15:24,183 --> 00:15:26,725
See? In critical moments like these,

241
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,248
you need to rely on your brother, right?

242
00:16:00,816 --> 00:16:02,628
Where are you going?

243
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,308
I need to pee.

244
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,375
You drank too much water earlier, huh?

245
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,409
Let's go. I'll help you.

246
00:16:10,465 --> 00:16:11,870
How are you going to help me?

247
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:16,308
(Toilet)

248
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:20,295
(Male)

249
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:21,941
You should step outside.

250
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,761
I can't pee with you standing here.

251
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:26,152
What about the IV bottle?

252
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:31,822
I'll stand here.

253
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,736
You go out! You go out!

254
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,611
Step forward a bit more.

255
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,353
And no peeking!

256
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,744
We're both guys, there's nothing to see.

257
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,588
Who cares to look?

258
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,119
Hey!

259
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,244
Thank you for last night.

260
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,103
No need to thank me.

261
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:18,583
If you really want to thank me,

262
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,111
treat me to a meal.

263
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:24,904
Oh, right.

264
00:17:24,928 --> 00:17:27,502
Last night, you said, 'Don't hit Mom!'

265
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,459
Did something unpleasant happen to you

266
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:30,912
when you were a kid?

267
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,853
Oh, it's nothing.

268
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,010
Oh, right,

269
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:37,967
you're so good at taking care of people.

270
00:17:37,983 --> 00:17:39,256
This can't be your first time.

271
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,228
You must've dated a lot before, huh?

272
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,361
Don't you know what I do?

273
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:47,695
I'm a dentist.

274
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,002
I take care of many patients.

275
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,674
It's just part of my job.

276
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:04,127
Oh, you're here.

277
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:05,694
We just ordered three dishes

278
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:06,750
and one soup for you.

279
00:18:06,757 --> 00:18:07,757
Eat slowly.

280
00:18:07,782 --> 00:18:09,393
Use chopsticks.

281
00:18:09,687 --> 00:18:11,096
Yeah, got it!

282
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,631
- Shi Wen,
- Hmm?

283
00:18:13,655 --> 00:18:15,986
This Shen Nan, is he good to you?

284
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:18,627
Actually, he's pretty nice.

285
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,861
You've only lived with

286
00:18:19,885 --> 00:18:20,977
him for a few days,

287
00:18:21,002 --> 00:18:22,674
and you've changed your opinion of him?

288
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,353
I guess so.

289
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:27,096
Yesterday, when I was sick,

290
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,514
I had a toothache and a fever,

291
00:18:28,522 --> 00:18:29,375
so I went to the hospital, right?

292
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,574
He stayed with me all night.

293
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:31,953
Are you okay now?

294
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:33,093
I'm fine now.

295
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,854
Haa, I didn't expect it!

296
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:38,945
Shen Nan is so nice to you.

297
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,320
Not bad!

298
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,670
Come on, let's toast

299
00:18:41,686 --> 00:18:43,126
since you're better.

300
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,415
- Come.
- Come.

301
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,086
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

302
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:47,334
Jiang Enya!

303
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,734
- Come on.
- Cheers!

304
00:18:49,763 --> 00:18:51,211
Gu Shi Wen!

305
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,047
You're on antibiotics.

306
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:55,118
Don't you know you can't drink alcohol?

307
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:57,273
Just a little. It's fine.

308
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:58,455
Gu Shi Wen!

309
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,779
Mixing antibiotics with

310
00:18:59,803 --> 00:19:01,016
alcohol can be fatal!

311
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,890
Don't you know this basic fact?

312
00:19:02,922 --> 00:19:04,095
Hey.

313
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:06,109
Why are you yelling at Shi Wen?

314
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,320
Would you believe that I

315
00:19:07,328 --> 00:19:08,929
can send someone to beat you?

316
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:10,843
Wait, it's you?

317
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:12,211
Don't yell at my brother!

318
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:13,435
Or else I'll...

319
00:19:13,812 --> 00:19:15,593
So you two were the ones causing

320
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,543
trouble at the café that day!

321
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,281
Turns out the three of you

322
00:19:19,297 --> 00:19:20,497
are working together!

323
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,508
We're all friends, we're all friends.

324
00:19:22,593 --> 00:19:23,601
It's no big deal.

325
00:19:23,626 --> 00:19:24,678
Shen Nan, come out.

326
00:19:24,695 --> 00:19:25,991
I need to talk to you.

327
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:36,015
Why do you care if I drink?

328
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:37,539
I didn't ask for your concern.

329
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,390
Do you think I want to meddle with you?

330
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:40,895
If I wasn't afraid of what would

331
00:19:40,904 --> 00:19:42,024
happen to you,

332
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,937
my father would have scolded me.

333
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:45,187
Tch.

334
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,010
What's our relationship anyway?

335
00:19:47,026 --> 00:19:48,479
Why are you managing me?

336
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm your big brother.

337
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,336
Tch.

338
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,297
I'll call your mom right now.

339
00:20:00,922 --> 00:20:02,508
Huh? Big brother!

340
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:04,976
My mom's finally on her honeymoon trip,

341
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,031
I want her to have fun.

342
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,961
Don't call her.

343
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,726
Big brother.

344
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,815
That's better, good boy.

345
00:20:13,831 --> 00:20:15,964
Listen to your brother, no drinking!

346
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:17,953
No drinking.

347
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,750
Cheers!

348
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,883
Why are you sighing?

349
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,078
Because I lied to my dad,

350
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,156
told him I was on leave.

351
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,159
Actually...

352
00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:00,914
I...

353
00:21:05,616 --> 00:21:08,413
Shen Nan, why are you treating like this?

354
00:21:09,746 --> 00:21:11,019
Director,

355
00:21:11,238 --> 00:21:13,534
as his attending physician,

356
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:15,574
I know his financial situation best.

357
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:17,144
The treatment plan I designed

358
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,713
is the most suitable for him.

359
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:20,297
Are you teaching
me how to do my job?

360
00:21:20,377 --> 00:21:22,215
I'm the director of this hospital.

361
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,445
What I say goes!

362
00:21:25,769 --> 00:21:29,101
You don't deserve to be a doctor.

363
00:21:29,399 --> 00:21:31,117
You don't prioritize patients' health

364
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:32,094
or finances.

365
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:34,063
All you do is push self-paid items

366
00:21:34,088 --> 00:21:35,944
to rake in high fees, taking advantage

367
00:21:35,969 --> 00:21:37,836
of them like cutting wheat.

368
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,102
It's doctors like you that make

369
00:21:40,127 --> 00:21:41,766
people constantly criticize

370
00:21:41,797 --> 00:21:43,335
dentistry for overtreatment!

371
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:44,554
Have you said enough?

372
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:45,774
How dare you argue with me!

373
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:47,320
Do you want to lose your job?

374
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,894
I'll just quit then!

375
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:57,821
That director is way too much.

376
00:21:57,846 --> 00:21:59,156
It's really inhumane.

377
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,867
Yes.

378
00:22:01,418 --> 00:22:02,976
It's really inhumane.

379
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,312
Cheers.

380
00:23:53,356 --> 00:23:54,917
Get a lot of rest.

381
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:56,902
I'll head out first.

382
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:16,393
Shi Wen, watch out!

383
00:24:35,294 --> 00:24:36,294
Here.

384
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:37,981
Try the stomach-warming soup

385
00:24:38,006 --> 00:24:39,894
I made for you. See how it tastes.

386
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,483
Not bad, you can cook too!

387
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,351
Alright, let me give it a proper taste.

388
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:56,720
Not bad.

389
00:24:59,173 --> 00:25:00,860
(Mom)

390
00:25:01,579 --> 00:25:02,735
Hello, Mom?

391
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,743
Son, how are things at home?

392
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:06,208
Pretty good.

393
00:25:06,232 --> 00:25:08,216
Big brother's taking good care of me.

394
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,056
You two have fun.

395
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,799
Son, if you two are getting along well,

396
00:25:11,831 --> 00:25:12,776
Mom can relax.

397
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,540
We'll be back in a few days.

398
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:15,649
Yes.

399
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,743
Shen Nan.

400
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,434
When do you plan to go back

401
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:20,731
to work at the hospital?

402
00:25:20,864 --> 00:25:22,567
I'm afraid that taking so much leave

403
00:25:22,591 --> 00:25:24,176
might affect your work.

404
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,329
Oh, Dad...

405
00:25:25,354 --> 00:25:26,688
The hospital hasn't been busy lately,

406
00:25:26,713 --> 00:25:28,166
so I've just rearranged my schedule.

407
00:25:28,174 --> 00:25:28,976
It's fine.

408
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,563
Alright, son.

409
00:25:30,785 --> 00:25:32,017
I understand the pressure

410
00:25:32,049 --> 00:25:33,456
and hardship you're under

411
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,095
but remember, your health is

412
00:25:35,104 --> 00:25:36,784
the most important thing.

413
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,032
Okay, okay, I get it, Dad.

414
00:25:39,057 --> 00:25:40,392
You and Auntie have fun.

415
00:25:40,401 --> 00:25:41,557
I'll hang up now. Bye!

416
00:25:43,639 --> 00:25:45,017
Let me serve you a bowl.

417
00:25:46,639 --> 00:25:48,704
It won't taste good once it cools.

418
00:25:49,879 --> 00:25:51,188
Here's a piece of meat for you.

419
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,306
Here.

420
00:27:07,046 --> 00:27:09,523
(Jingxi, entrance to the second floor)
(Digital braces)

421
00:27:09,548 --> 00:27:11,234
(Pediatric dentistry)

422
00:27:22,078 --> 00:27:24,078
(Dentist Recruitment)

423
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,390
(Jingxi dental)

424
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:32,632
(Jingxi dental)

425
00:27:36,461 --> 00:27:38,461
Welcome.

426
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,695
Relax. We're about to start.

427
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,110
If you feel any discomfort,

428
00:27:52,126 --> 00:27:53,726
let me know anytime.

429
00:27:53,915 --> 00:27:55,520
Mm, okay.

430
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:16,046
He's always so serious and professional.

431
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,655
Alright! Today, I propose a toast

432
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,294
to Shen Nan's decision!

433
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:20,795
From now on, our little town

434
00:29:20,827 --> 00:29:22,639
will have an outstanding dentist!

435
00:29:22,663 --> 00:29:24,731
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

436
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,720
Hey, Gu Shi Wen.

437
00:29:28,377 --> 00:29:29,964
You still can't drink, you know.

438
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:33,199
But today's such a happy day.

439
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:35,199
I'll just have a little, just one sip.

440
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,520
No.

441
00:29:37,282 --> 00:29:38,287
It's a happy day,

442
00:29:38,296 --> 00:29:40,829
I'll just have a little, just one sip.

443
00:29:42,703 --> 00:29:43,783
No.

444
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,442
This isn't some childish game.

445
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:46,978
I'll drink for you.

446
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,934
Don't say nonsense, you two,

447
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,470
I'd never do that.

448
00:29:53,639 --> 00:29:55,309
- Fifteen fifteen ten.
- Fifteen twenty none.

449
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,099
- Fifteen fifteen ten.
- Fifteen twenty fifteen.

450
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,960
- Fifteen twenty ten.
- Fifteen twenty twenty.

451
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,817
For some reason,

452
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,348
whenever I look at Shi Wen,

453
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:06,731
it often feels like we've met before.

454
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:21,625
That's better, good boy.

455
00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:23,438
Listen to your brother, no drinking!

456
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,668
No drinking.

457
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,840
- Twenty twenty fifteen.
- Fifteen twenty fifteen.

458
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,800
- Fifteen twenty twenty.
- Fifteen twenty twenty.

459
00:30:36,087 --> 00:30:37,847
What are you even doing?

460
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,934
- Fifteen twenty twenty.
- Fifteen twenty none.

461
00:30:40,134 --> 00:30:41,732
- Fifteen twenty fifteen.
- Fifteen twenty twenty.

462
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,480
- Fifteen twenty fifteen.
- Fifteen twenty twenty.

463
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,073
I lost again.

464
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:47,680
Shen Nan, what are you thinking?

465
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:51,385
I spaced out, I spaced out.

466
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:54,057
Just spaced out?

467
00:30:56,879 --> 00:30:58,346
Come, continue! What are you thinking?

468
00:30:58,371 --> 00:30:59,371
- Oh.
- Come on.

469
00:30:59,396 --> 00:31:00,682
- Fifteen twenty ten.
- Fifteen twenty none.

470
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:02,393
- Fifteen twenty fifteen.
- Fifteen twenty fifteen.

471
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,128
- Fifteen twenty ten.
- Fifteen twenty fifteen.

472
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,729
- Fifteen twenty ten.
- Fifteen twenty none.

473
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,590
Do you like it?

474
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,159
What are you doing here?

475
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,960
Did you get this for me?

476
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,013
Do you like it?

477
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,079
Are you asking if I like this gift?

478
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:01,169
What else would I be asking?

479
00:32:03,854 --> 00:32:05,173
I like

480
00:32:05,879 --> 00:32:06,935
you.

481
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:08,841
The gift you gave me.

482
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,638
You have to draw well.

483
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,440
Good luck.

484
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,294
Oh, the sun's rising in the west today.?

485
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,255
You actually put color on the drawing.

486
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:34,294
The key is that you can already tell

487
00:32:34,318 --> 00:32:36,083
the difference between red and green?

488
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,544
Isn't this the paint you've

489
00:32:42,568 --> 00:32:43,696
always wanted to buy?

490
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,810
Who gave it to you?

491
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,724
It's not from one of your fans, is it?

492
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,982
It's from Shen Nan.

493
00:32:54,676 --> 00:32:55,723
Wow!

494
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,974
It's just a gift.

495
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,396
What's the matter? Your heart throbs?

496
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,255
Heart throbbing?

497
00:33:06,435 --> 00:33:08,903
What do you think it feels like

498
00:33:08,935 --> 00:33:11,247
when you feel "moved?"

499
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:13,599
"Moved?"

500
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,655
You feel moved when you see someone,

501
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,992
and your face turns red,

502
00:33:19,016 --> 00:33:20,295
your heart races.

503
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:22,258
When you don't see them,

504
00:33:22,282 --> 00:33:24,265
you can't help but think of them.

505
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,700
Let's go, Enya, let's go throw stones.

506
00:33:27,725 --> 00:33:28,764
Come on.

507
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:29,789
- Huh?
- Come.

508
00:33:29,814 --> 00:33:31,552
Shi Wen, what are you thinking?

509
00:33:31,825 --> 00:33:33,481
No matter what you're thinking,

510
00:33:33,506 --> 00:33:34,606
just do it!

511
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:00,926
I've always had

512
00:34:00,935 --> 00:34:02,633
red-green color blindness.

513
00:34:02,657 --> 00:34:05,775
And he only came to this town

514
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,684
because his work wasn't going well.

515
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,098
Once he feels better,

516
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,324
he'll eventually leave.

517
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,160
What I want to do,

518
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,932
just do it.

519
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,999
Hello, little brother.

520
00:34:58,879 --> 00:35:00,392
I'm Shen Nan.

521
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,319
Don't go.

522
00:35:14,959 --> 00:35:16,088
I'm not leaving.

523
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:59,092
Shen Nan, where are you?

524
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,835
I'm waiting for you at the station.

525
00:36:00,851 --> 00:36:02,593
I have something to tell you.

526
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:21,826
Shen Nan!

527
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:23,208
Shi Wen!

528
00:36:25,373 --> 00:36:27,537
I like you!

529
00:36:29,408 --> 00:36:31,725
I can't hear what you're saying.

530
00:36:31,752 --> 00:36:34,935
I said, I like you.

531
00:36:34,968 --> 00:36:36,092
Huh?

532
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,668
Shi Wen, don't move.

533
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,760
(Next episode)

534
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:32,751
How did I end up here?

535
00:38:36,225 --> 00:38:37,338
Shi Wen!

536
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,369
Shi Wen!

537
00:38:42,511 --> 00:38:45,033
Who are you? Do we know each other?

538
00:38:45,058 --> 00:38:46,611
(Wednesday, June 5th at 5:12 p.m.)

539
00:38:47,745 --> 00:38:50,002
Time has gone back three months.

540
00:38:51,603 --> 00:38:53,055
It's raining outside.

541
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,259
I'm looking for a place

542
00:38:54,275 --> 00:38:55,415
to shelter from the rain.

543
00:38:55,439 --> 00:38:56,775
I saw Shi Wen wasn't around.

544
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,695
So I just came in first.

545
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,783
Put it down and leave.

546
00:39:09,108 --> 00:39:10,759
Isn't this me?

547
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,189
How does he have my portrait?
