00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,900
(I'll Turn Back This Time)

2
00:00:44,924 --> 00:00:47,424
(Episode 4)

3
00:00:50,931 --> 00:00:52,734
The patient is losing too much blood.
Prepare for surgery immediately.

4
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:54,757
Got it. Contact the surgery team now.

5
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:03,859
Shi Wen.

6
00:01:04,419 --> 00:01:05,419
Shi Wen!

7
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,354
Please, save him!

8
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,651
I'll do anything.

9
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:11,909
Shi Wen!

10
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:13,149
Shi Wen!

11
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:14,971
Shi Wen.

12
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,629
Good morning, Shen Nan.

13
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,110
What's wrong?

14
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,870
Did you have a nightmare?

15
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:53,189
It's nothing.

16
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:54,989
Nothing at all.

17
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:03,605
Don't worry. I'll go handle this.

18
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,500
(Episode 4: Gladly)

19
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,230
Is this soup for me?

20
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,230
Yes.

21
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:26,520
Yesterday afternoon, when you

22
00:02:26,552 --> 00:02:27,677
were looking after me,

23
00:02:27,701 --> 00:02:29,124
you almost hurt your arm.

24
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:31,390
So, I made some soup for you.

25
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:32,645
Drink it while it's hot.

26
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,960
It tastes better that way.

27
00:02:34,382 --> 00:02:35,382
I'll give it a try.

28
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:42,226
It's delicious!

29
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,390
Really good!

30
00:02:48,444 --> 00:02:49,444
Shi Wen,

31
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:50,772
your cooking skills could

32
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,285
easily open a restaurant.

33
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:54,205
- Really?
- Absolutely!

34
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,165
Maybe I should tell Jiang Yilin tomorrow

35
00:02:56,197 --> 00:02:57,331
to add this dish to

36
00:02:57,347 --> 00:02:58,565
his restaurant's menu.

37
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:00,046
That's a great idea!

38
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:06,790
But...

39
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,830
What is it?

40
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,110
Do you have something to tell me?

41
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,309
Yesterday...

42
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:14,589
I...

43
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,452
Yesterday...

44
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:19,538
What happened yesterday?

45
00:03:21,749 --> 00:03:23,835
I had a nightmare yesterday.

46
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,565
I dreamt that you had a car accident.

47
00:03:29,382 --> 00:03:30,993
I had a car accident?

48
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,860
But I'm perfectly fine now.

49
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,610
Dreams are always the opposite.

50
00:03:35,672 --> 00:03:36,804
Yes, yes. Dreams are

51
00:03:36,813 --> 00:03:38,046
always the opposite.

52
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,070
Drink your soup.

53
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:49,350
Actually...

54
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,094
What I really wanted to say is...

55
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:55,665
Yesterday, you told me...

56
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,230
Yesterday?

57
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:03,079
I said so many things yesterday.

58
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,743
Which one are you referring to?

59
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,589
It's...

60
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:13,670
It's...

61
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,253
I like you.

62
00:04:29,149 --> 00:04:30,190
Shi Wen...

63
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,879
How about we go on a trip?

64
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,668
I want to travel with just you.

65
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,830
I want to be with you

66
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:44,190
and do so many things together.

67
00:04:46,109 --> 00:04:47,149
You...

68
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,229
Are you serious?

69
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,469
Will you go with me?

70
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,870
I will.

71
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:08,421
Shi Wen!

72
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,510
Shen Nan!

73
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:10,750
Shi Wen!

74
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:13,149
Shen Nan!

75
00:05:13,341 --> 00:05:14,341
Shi Wen!

76
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,675
Shen Nan!

77
00:05:22,183 --> 00:05:24,472
(Please be happy, please be joyful)

78
00:05:24,886 --> 00:05:28,285
(Please accept good luck)

79
00:05:28,863 --> 00:05:33,550
(Please accept good luck)

80
00:06:10,352 --> 00:06:11,352
Come.

81
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,509
Are you okay?

82
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:16,229
Hey.

83
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:18,229
It's nothing.

84
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,389
What are you doing?

85
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,526
Hope you like it.

86
00:08:49,869 --> 00:08:51,276
It's alright.

87
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,150
Hey. Fireworks.

88
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:13,658
Fireworks.

89
00:09:30,521 --> 00:09:32,284
Shi Wen, turn around.

90
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,430
Did you get the shot?

91
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,150
Got it.

92
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,589
Haven't seen fireworks in a long time.

93
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,434
Oh my... What's going on?

94
00:11:08,469 --> 00:11:09,925
Enya! Come here, quick!

95
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,434
What? What? What?

96
00:11:11,749 --> 00:11:13,622
Isn't that Shi Wen and Shen Nan?

97
00:11:23,662 --> 00:11:25,101
That expression...

98
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:26,782
do you know something?

99
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,127
Brother,

100
00:11:29,152 --> 00:11:31,389
don't you think they suit each other?

101
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,109
Them?

102
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,709
You knew this all along?

103
00:11:35,785 --> 00:11:37,595
Yeah, I knew all along.

104
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,316
Seems like Shen Nan has

105
00:11:39,325 --> 00:11:41,160
a big influence on Shi Wen.

106
00:11:43,229 --> 00:11:45,283
Brother, why don't you date someone too?

107
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,150
Look how happy they are.

108
00:11:47,175 --> 00:11:48,627
Stop, stop, stop.

109
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:49,986
Don't change the subject.

110
00:11:52,682 --> 00:11:54,267
Let me process this.

111
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,869
Old-fashioned.

112
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,389
Why is it rusted?

113
00:12:49,815 --> 00:12:52,837
(No loving each other)

114
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:09,910
Is all of this...

115
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:12,989
foreshadowing something?

116
00:13:25,229 --> 00:13:27,334
Shen Nan, come eat breakfast.

117
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:29,694
I'm skipping it.
I have something urgent.

118
00:13:29,749 --> 00:13:31,131
I need to head out.

119
00:13:44,486 --> 00:13:46,431
(Time loop of parallel worlds)

120
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,349
Shen Nan.

121
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:18,569
- Mm.
- Mm.

122
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,251
- Mm.
- Mm.

123
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,032
- Mm.
- Mm.

124
00:14:31,749 --> 00:14:33,765
Shi Wen, I didn't expect it.

125
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,563
Your soup is better than mine.

126
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,282
I'll add it to our menu.

127
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,266
Every Monday, you'll make it.

128
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,859
- It's settled.
- Mm.

129
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,430
Okay.

130
00:14:48,749 --> 00:14:51,680
Shi Wen, you seem off today.

131
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,610
Distracted all the time.

132
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:56,270
Did you and Shen Nan argue?

133
00:14:56,589 --> 00:14:57,844
No, not at all.

134
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,768
I'm just dealing with

135
00:14:59,777 --> 00:15:01,057
some issues lately.

136
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,321
Maybe it's just a misunderstanding.

137
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:08,469
I don't know either.

138
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,533
Lately, Shen Nan seems to be

139
00:15:10,557 --> 00:15:12,415
avoiding me on purpose.

140
00:15:14,109 --> 00:15:16,758
Then you two should talk directly.

141
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,547
Stop guessing each other's thoughts.

142
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,719
Guessing each other's thoughts...

143
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:28,469
You're right. I'll head back.

144
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,709
Make sure to finish the soup, you two.

145
00:15:32,726 --> 00:15:34,461
Look at him rushing off as soon as

146
00:15:34,469 --> 00:15:35,711
Shen Nan is mentioned.

147
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,109
Where's the ring?

148
00:16:00,516 --> 00:16:02,247
I think I left it in the bathroom

149
00:16:02,263 --> 00:16:03,623
after my shower.

150
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,190
Where is it?

151
00:16:20,865 --> 00:16:22,989
Huh? Not in there?

152
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,575
Did I leave it on the bedside table

153
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:26,942
or in a drawer?

154
00:16:32,109 --> 00:16:33,413
Shen Nan,

155
00:16:33,835 --> 00:16:35,564
something's off with you lately.

156
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:36,651
Why does it feel like

157
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:37,862
you're avoiding me?

158
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,577
I'm not.

159
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:41,790
You're not?

160
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:45,430
Did I do something wrong

161
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,989
to upset you?

162
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,324
No.

163
00:16:49,349 --> 00:16:50,685
You've done everything right.

164
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:51,740
Don't overthink it.

165
00:16:56,509 --> 00:16:58,030
Shen Nan, let me ask you,

166
00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:01,229
do you not like me anymore?

167
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,830
My condition isn't good lately.

168
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:19,750
Don't overthink it.

169
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,987
I converted the first floor of

170
00:17:32,996 --> 00:17:34,440
the guesthouse into a café.

171
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,917
I've devoted my heart to it

172
00:17:35,933 --> 00:17:37,046
for many years.

173
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,097
From the tough beginnings

174
00:17:38,113 --> 00:17:39,190
of starting a business,

175
00:17:39,215 --> 00:17:41,112
to now, every cup of coffee

176
00:17:41,137 --> 00:17:43,004
holds my passion and effort.

177
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,839
If there's time, I'll help you

178
00:17:45,855 --> 00:17:47,588
manage this shop together.

179
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,710
Let's go in and have a look.

180
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:53,790
Son.

181
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,909
What are you doing here?

182
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,062
Dad.

183
00:17:58,499 --> 00:17:59,525
Oh.

184
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,081
Our hospital organized a

185
00:18:01,106 --> 00:18:02,905
free clinic event, so we came here.

186
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:03,966
Umm...

187
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,257
This is your aunt.

188
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:06,644
Hello, Aunt.

189
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,077
You must be Shen Nan.

190
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:09,273
Yes.

191
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,679
Come on in.

192
00:18:12,109 --> 00:18:13,151
Speaking of which,

193
00:18:13,183 --> 00:18:14,325
today is truly coincidental.

194
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:15,385
Shen Nan came to

195
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,714
the town for the free clinic

196
00:18:16,739 --> 00:18:18,020
and ended up staying at

197
00:18:18,034 --> 00:18:19,286
the guesthouse your aunt runs.

198
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,685
It really confirms that saying,

199
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:21,901
If we're not the same family,

200
00:18:21,925 --> 00:18:23,258
we can't live in the same house.

201
00:18:23,283 --> 00:18:25,203
Come, let's have a toast.

202
00:18:29,589 --> 00:18:31,339
I have another happy announcement

203
00:18:31,347 --> 00:18:32,205
to make.

204
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,750
I'm planning to marry your aunt.

205
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:40,510
Feeling better?

206
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,485
In a few days, you two brothers

207
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,277
can decorate the guesthouse,

208
00:18:45,302 --> 00:18:46,725
so everyone can celebrate.

209
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,446
I want to make up for the love your aunt

210
00:18:48,471 --> 00:18:50,479
missed out on over the years.

211
00:18:50,946 --> 00:18:52,164
Alright, Dad.

212
00:18:52,189 --> 00:18:54,389
- Eat, eat!
- Let's dig in.

213
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,446
This fish is good.

214
00:18:58,563 --> 00:18:59,990
By the way,

215
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:01,525
Son.

216
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,844
You're not young anymore.

217
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:05,765
An old colleague of mine has a daughter,

218
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,313
she's well-mannered, very polite.

219
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:09,464
One of these days,

220
00:19:09,472 --> 00:19:10,859
I'll introduce you to her.

221
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:11,938
Dad,

222
00:19:11,963 --> 00:19:13,775
as long as you and Aunt are happy,

223
00:19:13,783 --> 00:19:15,227
don't worry about me.

224
00:19:15,251 --> 00:19:16,446
Oh, oh.

225
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,909
You rascal.

226
00:19:18,109 --> 00:19:20,235
You already have someone you like, yes?

227
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,089
No.

228
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:28,384
I just feel like work has been

229
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,486
too busy recently.

230
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,019
I haven't had the time.

231
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:32,429
If that's the case,

232
00:19:32,652 --> 00:19:34,180
I'll send you her WeChat later

233
00:19:34,188 --> 00:19:35,565
so you can add her.

234
00:19:35,589 --> 00:19:36,992
Start as friends, no harm in

235
00:19:37,016 --> 00:19:38,365
grabbing a meal together.

236
00:19:38,396 --> 00:19:40,502
Young people should socialize more.

237
00:19:42,191 --> 00:19:44,230
Let me take a look.

238
00:19:44,262 --> 00:19:45,757
See for yourself.

239
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,144
Looks good, doesn't she?

240
00:19:47,189 --> 00:19:48,669
She matches Shen Nan perfectly.

241
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,429
Shi Wen, look. Are they a good match?

242
00:19:57,389 --> 00:19:58,869
How are they a match?

243
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,109
Aren't they?

244
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:03,644
- She's pretty.
- Yes, with fair skin.

245
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:04,840
The important thing is that

246
00:20:04,865 --> 00:20:05,982
we know each other.

247
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:10,550
Uncle, Aunt, I'm full.

248
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:12,284
Take your time eating.

249
00:20:12,316 --> 00:20:13,316
Ah...

250
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,379
Hey.

251
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,710
This kid…

252
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,355
It's okay, let's continue eating.

253
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,429
Son, come, eat more.

254
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,527
Try your aunt's cooking.

255
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,349
What's wrong?

256
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,710
Are you mad?

257
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:41,189
Why would I be mad?

258
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:43,189
I don't have any reason to be mad.

259
00:20:44,669 --> 00:20:46,415
You added that girl on WeChat, right?

260
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,282
Chatting happily, aren't you?

261
00:20:52,712 --> 00:20:53,712
Mm.

262
00:20:56,101 --> 00:20:58,204
(Xinxin: Uncle Shen introduced me. My name is Xinxin. Are you free this weekend? Let's have a meal together)

263
00:20:58,229 --> 00:20:59,665
(Shen Nan: Sorry, I already have someone I like)

264
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:02,936
Let me ask you this,

265
00:21:03,109 --> 00:21:04,710
Where's the ring I gave you?

266
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:06,310
Why aren't you wearing it?

267
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:07,698
Or is it that you

268
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:10,230
simply don't want to wear it?

269
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,919
Actually, the ring is broken.

270
00:21:17,869 --> 00:21:18,949
Broken?

271
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,790
You said it was fine a few days ago.

272
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,230
I was afraid you'd get mad.

273
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:29,349
So I didn't tell you.

274
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:32,223
I was planning to get it fixed,

275
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,189
and then tell you about it.

276
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,030
Shen Nan, let me ask you,

277
00:21:36,389 --> 00:21:38,676
why have you been so cold to me lately?

278
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,205
Now the ring is broken too.

279
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,761
Are you saying you don't feel

280
00:21:41,786 --> 00:21:43,466
anything for me anymore?

281
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:46,445
Shi Wen, calm down first. Listen to me.

282
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,725
How can I calm down?

283
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,641
Shen Nan, you promised to take me to

284
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,302
see fireworks, to travel together.

285
00:21:51,349 --> 00:21:53,445
Are you just messing with me now?

286
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,404
- Keep your voice down.
- Let go of me!

287
00:21:55,429 --> 00:21:57,128
Let go of me!

288
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,525
Shi Wen is so capable.

289
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,084
You even made breakfast for us.

290
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:29,109
Uncle, if you like it, eat a lot.

291
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:30,421
Alright.

292
00:22:31,648 --> 00:22:33,140
It's delicious.

293
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:36,999
Here, two more sandwiches.

294
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,538
Sandwiches too?

295
00:22:42,484 --> 00:22:43,629
It's nothing, nothing.

296
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:44,874
Probably the wind.

297
00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:46,669
It's fine.

298
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,750
Hey. Are you okay?

299
00:23:03,389 --> 00:23:04,550
I'm fine.

300
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,149
Mom, I'm heading out to buy groceries.

301
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:14,197
Mm.

302
00:23:36,629 --> 00:23:38,189
What's wrong, Auntie?

303
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,130
Last night,

304
00:23:40,146 --> 00:23:41,731
I saw through the door crack,

305
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,070
you and Shi Wen...

306
00:23:53,629 --> 00:23:54,949
Auntie.

307
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,375
I can explain this to you.

308
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:00,855
It's okay, you don't need to

309
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,964
explain for now.

310
00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:06,281
I feel like all of this is my fault.

311
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:10,203
Shi Wen never had a warm home growing up.

312
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,743
As a child, he protected me from

313
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:14,447
being hurt by his father.

314
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,094
He has always been at odds

315
00:24:16,103 --> 00:24:17,205
with his father.

316
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,305
Do you think it's because

317
00:24:20,329 --> 00:24:21,645
I failed to take care of him,

318
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,804
that he feels so troubled inside?

319
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:26,171
No, no, Auntie.

320
00:24:26,389 --> 00:24:27,669
It's not because of you.

321
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,510
Shi Wen has been weak since childhood.

322
00:24:33,629 --> 00:24:35,664
He needs someone to rely on.

323
00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:38,310
As a mother,

324
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,589
I've raised him alone all these years.

325
00:24:42,109 --> 00:24:43,349
I had to work,

326
00:24:44,077 --> 00:24:45,390
and didn't have much time

327
00:24:45,414 --> 00:24:46,507
to care for him.

328
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:49,280
It's my fault for not

329
00:24:49,305 --> 00:24:50,632
taking better care of him.

330
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,470
Auntie,

331
00:24:54,949 --> 00:24:56,790
please don't think that way.

332
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:59,731
Yes, he needs someone to lean on.

333
00:25:03,149 --> 00:25:04,990
I'm willing to be that person.

334
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:15,589
Thank you, Shen Nan.

335
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,429
But your relationship...

336
00:25:19,542 --> 00:25:21,468
If others find out about it,

337
00:25:22,149 --> 00:25:25,629
I'm worried Shi Wen will be talked about.

338
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,063
He's already endured so much pain

339
00:25:28,087 --> 00:25:29,204
since childhood.

340
00:25:30,949 --> 00:25:33,188
I don't want people gossiping

341
00:25:33,204 --> 00:25:35,004
about him because of this.

342
00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:37,790
Shen Nan, as a mother,

343
00:25:38,189 --> 00:25:40,171
can you understand how I feel?

344
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:43,349
So, Shen Nan,

345
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:45,444
as an older brother,

346
00:25:45,469 --> 00:25:46,812
you must remain rational.

347
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,869
Auntie, I beg you, please let Shi Wen go.

348
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,109
Auntie,

349
00:25:57,344 --> 00:25:58,429
I...

350
00:26:05,024 --> 00:26:07,661
- No...
- You ungrateful child!

351
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:12,696
You've ruined this family!

352
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,407
Stop it! Talk it out calmly!

353
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:20,045
I worked so hard to raise you,

354
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,718
hoping you'd have a good life

355
00:26:21,734 --> 00:26:22,734
and future.

356
00:26:23,101 --> 00:26:24,991
But what you've done

357
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:26,437
is worse than an animal!

358
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,648
Do you know the difference

359
00:26:28,656 --> 00:26:29,766
between humans and animals?

360
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,070
Do you?

361
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,473
Humans have self-control

362
00:26:32,489 --> 00:26:33,651
and moral boundaries!

363
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:36,797
What do you have? Look at yourself now!

364
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:43,217
Dad,

365
00:26:44,629 --> 00:26:47,230
I don't care about what others think.

366
00:26:47,349 --> 00:26:49,710
I only care about what you think.

367
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,589
Because you're my father!

368
00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:56,005
From today onward,

369
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,629
you're out of this house!

370
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:00,951
- Why?
- What why?

371
00:27:01,389 --> 00:27:02,647
As long as I'm here,

372
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,240
you will listen to me!

373
00:27:15,903 --> 00:27:17,036
Take a look.

374
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,790
Shen Nan,

375
00:27:29,037 --> 00:27:30,524
you'll stay here and rest

376
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:31,876
for the next few days.

377
00:27:33,425 --> 00:27:34,751
By the way, lend me

378
00:27:34,776 --> 00:27:36,017
your phone for a call.

379
00:27:48,189 --> 00:27:49,573
Dad.

380
00:27:49,604 --> 00:27:51,629
Dad! What are you doing?

381
00:27:51,773 --> 00:27:53,045
Let me out!

382
00:27:53,077 --> 00:27:54,837
Give me back my phone!

383
00:27:54,909 --> 00:27:55,944
- Dad!
- Shen Nan,

384
00:27:55,969 --> 00:27:57,249
you'll reflect on yourself here

385
00:27:57,274 --> 00:27:58,250
for the next few days.

386
00:27:58,274 --> 00:27:59,532
I can't let Shi Wen's mother

387
00:27:59,557 --> 00:28:00,525
be heartbroken.

388
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,722
So,

389
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,045
you two must break up.

390
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,750
You must be separated.

391
00:28:04,941 --> 00:28:06,077
Dad.

392
00:28:06,565 --> 00:28:08,487
You only care about yourself.

393
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:10,316
You only care about Shi Wen's mother.

394
00:28:10,349 --> 00:28:11,805
I'm your son!

395
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,839
Since I was a child,

396
00:28:12,855 --> 00:28:13,870
have you ever cared about me?

397
00:28:13,886 --> 00:28:14,845
Have you ever thought about me?

398
00:28:14,869 --> 00:28:16,245
Why are you stopping me?

399
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,003
Why can't I love Shi Wen?

400
00:28:18,109 --> 00:28:19,292
Why?

401
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,839
Dad!

402
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:22,149
Open the door for me!

403
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,070
Open the door!

404
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,349
What makes us any different?

405
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,750
What makes us different?

406
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:33,189
Tell me, what's the difference?

407
00:28:34,949 --> 00:28:37,109
Dad, open the door for me.

408
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,629
Open the door!

409
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,733
Dad,

410
00:28:44,542 --> 00:28:47,629
What gives you the right? Why?

411
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,669
Shen Nan.

412
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,070
Shen Nan.

413
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:08,650
Shen...

414
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,771
Hello, the number you dialed

415
00:29:21,796 --> 00:29:23,377
is currently switched off.

416
00:29:23,431 --> 00:29:25,133
Please try again later.

417
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,112
Hello, the number you dialed

418
00:29:41,152 --> 00:29:42,885
is currently switched off.

419
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:44,838
Please try again later.

420
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,122
Hello.

421
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:04,710
Hello, the number you dialed

422
00:30:04,735 --> 00:30:06,468
is currently switched off.

423
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,189
Have something to eat.

424
00:30:31,589 --> 00:30:34,384
Mom, where did Shen Nan go?

425
00:30:43,589 --> 00:30:46,983
Mom, do you know something?

426
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,710
I like Shen Nan.

427
00:31:04,589 --> 00:31:06,589
I can't keep lying to you.

428
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,909
I know this

429
00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:11,070
is hard for you to accept.

430
00:31:12,429 --> 00:31:14,456
But this is who I am.

431
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,909
I'm sorry.

432
00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:19,349
Mom.

433
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,349
Mom, do you know?

434
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,347
These past few days,

435
00:31:25,363 --> 00:31:27,096
without seeing Shen Nan...

436
00:31:27,189 --> 00:31:28,399
Do you know how much

437
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:29,509
I've been suffering?

438
00:31:30,629 --> 00:31:32,589
I feel like I want to die.

439
00:31:33,429 --> 00:31:34,990
Don't say that.

440
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:36,790
Don't say such things.

441
00:31:36,909 --> 00:31:39,750
Are you like this because of me?

442
00:31:40,101 --> 00:31:41,179
Mom,

443
00:31:41,487 --> 00:31:43,237
what does this have to do with you?

444
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,470
I'm afraid...

445
00:31:46,909 --> 00:31:49,429
I didn't take good care of you.

446
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:52,429
And made you feel lonely.

447
00:31:53,189 --> 00:31:54,790
Mom.

448
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,230
It's me.

449
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,429
This was my choice.

450
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:08,310
Mom, do you know?

451
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:13,070
When I was at my lowest...

452
00:32:14,629 --> 00:32:16,949
When life felt hopeless...

453
00:32:17,149 --> 00:32:18,750
It was Shen Nan

454
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:20,813
who kept encouraging me.

455
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,109
He gave me warmth.

456
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,270
Mom.

457
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,949
I'm begging you.

458
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:31,157
Tell me where Shen Nan is!

459
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,310
Mom!

460
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,376
Please, just tell me where Shen Nan is!

461
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,790
I'm begging you. Tell me, Mom.

462
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,030
Shi Wen, don't force me!

463
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,710
I'm begging you, Mom.

464
00:32:56,550 --> 00:33:00,103
Uncle, tell me where Shen Nan went.

465
00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:03,127
I sent him away from here.

466
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,908
You won't see him again.

467
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,629
Shi Wen.

468
00:33:08,869 --> 00:33:10,033
Shi Wen!

469
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,389
Shi Wen!

470
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,990
Shen Nan!

471
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:38,470
Shen Nan!

472
00:33:38,869 --> 00:33:40,070
Shen Nan!

473
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,753
Look, isn't that Shi Wen?

474
00:34:13,421 --> 00:34:14,582
Shi Wen!

475
00:34:15,505 --> 00:34:16,790
Shi Wen!

476
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:19,790
Mom is begging you.

477
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,949
Mom is begging you.

478
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,830
Mom is begging you.

479
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:26,790
Don't do anything foolish.

480
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:28,429
Mom.

481
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:02,449
Did we do something wrong?

482
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:10,670
I feel like everything we've done

483
00:35:10,989 --> 00:35:13,355
is slowly hurting Shi Wen.

484
00:35:14,549 --> 00:35:15,670
Yeah.

485
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,429
I never thought something like this

486
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,549
would happen to our family.

487
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:23,119
I always thought this was

488
00:35:23,144 --> 00:35:24,877
someone else's problem.

489
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,549
But I never expected...

490
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,190
We can't keep arguing with them.

491
00:35:32,332 --> 00:35:34,012
We can't ask them why they made

492
00:35:34,043 --> 00:35:35,277
these choices anymore.

493
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:38,090
I don't want to see the kids

494
00:35:38,106 --> 00:35:39,918
doing something foolish again.

495
00:35:41,549 --> 00:35:43,310
Let's just let it go.

496
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,949
After Shen Nan's mother passed away,

497
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:56,150
I was always away for work.

498
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:00,069
I just wanted to give him the best life.

499
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,349
But I didn't expect

500
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,916
to neglect his emotional needs.

501
00:36:16,949 --> 00:36:18,069
How about

502
00:36:18,429 --> 00:36:20,989
we stop interfering with the kids?

503
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,310
As long as they are healthy,

504
00:36:23,429 --> 00:36:24,869
and happy, that's enough.

505
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,190
Shen Nan.

506
00:36:54,909 --> 00:36:56,808
Shi Wen's mom told me

507
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,823
not to make you suffer anymore.

508
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,510
But I still want to ask you

509
00:37:01,518 --> 00:37:02,638
one more time.

510
00:37:05,069 --> 00:37:08,151
Have you really made up your mind?

511
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,349
I'm sorry.

512
00:37:18,549 --> 00:37:19,549
Dad.

513
00:37:21,389 --> 00:37:22,710
All my life,

514
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,326
I've never asked you for anything.

515
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:28,029
But this time,

516
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:32,869
I want to ask you for this.

517
00:37:34,509 --> 00:37:36,670
I truly love Shi Wen.

518
00:37:38,549 --> 00:37:40,795
Please let us be together.

519
00:38:34,949 --> 00:38:36,021
Shi Wen.

520
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,899
You two must be happy.

521
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:55,130
(No loving each other)

522
00:41:53,004 --> 00:41:55,004
(Next episode)

523
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:00,790
Congratulations, Shi Wen.

524
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,285
Can you come to my award ceremony?

525
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:07,028
I haven't seen Shi Wen this happy

526
00:42:07,052 --> 00:42:08,206
in a long time.

527
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,457
He's changed a lot under your influence.

528
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,339
If you truly love him too,

529
00:42:12,389 --> 00:42:14,722
please protect him like us.

530
00:42:23,146 --> 00:42:24,415
Shen Nan!
