(Emergency room)

3
00:01:37,195 --> 00:01:38,356
How's Shi Wen?

4
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:40,740
How is he?

5
00:01:40,782 --> 00:01:43,474
Sir, we've done our best.

6
00:01:46,616 --> 00:01:47,767
Impossible.

7
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,048
Shi Wen.

8
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:53,126
Shi Wen.

9
00:02:50,488 --> 00:02:51,626
Shi Wen.

10
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,617
Shi Wen.

11
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:05,532
Shi Wen.

12
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,462
Shi Wen.

13
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,540
Why?

14
00:03:15,123 --> 00:03:16,461
Why?

15
00:03:18,685 --> 00:03:20,056
Shi Wen!

16
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,281
How did I end up here?

17
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,320
Shi Wen, Shi Wen.

18
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:47,820
Shi Wen.

19
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,094
Answer the phone, Shi Wen.

20
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,523
Answer the phone.

21
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:55,344
Shi Wen, you must wait for me.

22
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:01,875
I'm sorry.

23
00:05:03,121 --> 00:05:04,265
(June 5, 2024)
Wait a minute.

24
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,914
How is it June?

25
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:09,970
Excuse me, little girl.

26
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,953
It seems I broke your watch by accident.

27
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,381
It's showing the wrong time.

28
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:14,654
I'll replace one for you.

29
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,398
But the time is correct.

30
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
(Episode 2: The Most Familiar Stranger)

31
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,284
Shi Wen.

32
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,393
Shi Wen.

33
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,503
I had a nightmare.

34
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:49,486
I thought I'd never see you again.

35
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,877
You... Who are you? Do I know you?

36
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:59,721
Shi Wen, it's me! Don't you remember me?

37
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:03,304
I'm sorry.

38
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,315
We get so many customers here,

39
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,825
I must have forgotten you.

40
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,276
I'm not just a customer. I'm Shen Nan!

41
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:10,893
Earlier, I was still...

42
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:18,838
Wasn't this a landscape painting before?

43
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:21,752
It's always been a still-life sketch.

44
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,573
Brother, are you okay?

45
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:28,065
Should I call a doctor for you?

46
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:38,202
(Wednesday, June 5th at 5:12 p.m.)

47
00:06:39,786 --> 00:06:42,327
Time has returned to three months ago.

48
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:48,398
Has time reset itself?

49
00:06:57,722 --> 00:06:59,140
Is he crazy?

50
00:07:02,092 --> 00:07:03,241
Jiang Yilin.

51
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:05,257
Jiang Yilin.

52
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:07,116
Jiang Yilin.

53
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,960
Hello, scan the QR code to order.

54
00:07:11,401 --> 00:07:13,272
Yilin, it's me!

55
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,679
Why act so familiar?

56
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,929
Who are you? I don't know you.

57
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:20,327
It's me, Shen Nan.

58
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,781
What Shen Nan?

59
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:25,063
Let me tell you, eating is fine,

60
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,008
but harassing the owner?

61
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,446
I'll beat you so hard you wouldn't

62
00:07:28,471 --> 00:07:29,852
be able to find your home.

63
00:07:30,677 --> 00:07:32,608
Why doesn't anyone remember me?

64
00:07:33,115 --> 00:07:34,398
Never mind.

65
00:07:34,991 --> 00:07:36,732
Just get me fried rice.

66
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,499
Oh, and add two eggs.

67
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,427
One order of egg fried rice

68
00:07:41,435 --> 00:07:42,555
with two eggs.

69
00:07:46,046 --> 00:07:47,744
Hey, how did you know?

70
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:48,956
Of course, I know.

71
00:07:48,972 --> 00:07:50,331
You can't bear to drink it,

72
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:51,530
so I'll drink it for you.

73
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,145
Oh, you peeping maniac!

74
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,569
Daring to spy on me? Get out!

75
00:07:54,594 --> 00:07:56,015
Let me explain!

76
00:07:56,081 --> 00:07:58,882
Fine, fine, I'll leave. Still not okay?

77
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,804
Don't let me see you again!

78
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,327
Crazy person.

79
00:08:24,891 --> 00:08:26,544
Who are you?

80
00:08:26,898 --> 00:08:28,308
You don't need to know.

81
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:30,453
The quantum necklace brought you back

82
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:31,977
to three months ago.

83
00:08:32,689 --> 00:08:34,075
Time has been reset.

84
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,272
Everything you interact with

85
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:38,154
will change because of this.

86
00:08:38,689 --> 00:08:40,170
The butterfly effect will lead

87
00:08:40,195 --> 00:08:41,987
to unimaginable consequences.

88
00:08:42,026 --> 00:08:43,200
What consequences?

89
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:45,880
You don't need to know.

90
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:48,723
If you forcefully alter the ending...

91
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,209
Otherwise...

92
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:51,903
Otherwise what?

93
00:08:53,969 --> 00:08:55,700
Say it! Otherwise what? Tell me!

94
00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:00,442
You stop talking at the crucial moment?

95
00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:06,622
It's fine.

96
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,343
Then let's start over and

97
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:10,875
get to know each other again.

98
00:09:59,729 --> 00:10:02,098
Let the rain fall completely.

99
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,488
You two, slow down!

100
00:10:03,513 --> 00:10:04,796
Shi Wen, that note you sang was off-key.

101
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,106
Brother, did you hear it?

102
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,741
So, that guy from this morning

103
00:10:07,765 --> 00:10:09,554
wasn't a local from our town?

104
00:10:09,785 --> 00:10:11,296
Definitely not. Are there people in

105
00:10:11,304 --> 00:10:12,626
this town that I don't know?

106
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,074
What if he's a tourist?

107
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,528
Who cares who he is? Whatever.

108
00:10:17,472 --> 00:10:18,653
Hey, hey!

109
00:10:19,626 --> 00:10:20,723
Who's that?

110
00:10:20,748 --> 00:10:21,762
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

111
00:10:22,369 --> 00:10:24,387
I think I heard something inside.

112
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:26,625
Could it be a thief?

113
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,029
Impossible. I locked the door

114
00:10:28,053 --> 00:10:28,951
when I left.

115
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,153
Three, two, one...

116
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,153
- Come out!
- Come out!

117
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:45,185
Come out! Come out!

118
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:46,379
- Get the thief!
- Come out!

119
00:10:46,404 --> 00:10:49,209
Don't hit me! It's me, it's me, it's me!

120
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,340
Put it down.

121
00:10:51,436 --> 00:10:52,717
Calm down, calm down!

122
00:10:54,546 --> 00:10:55,905
It's raining outside.

123
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,707
I just needed a place to take shelter.

124
00:10:58,202 --> 00:10:59,625
I saw Shi Wen wasn't here,

125
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,781
so I had no choice but

126
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:01,812
to come in myself.

127
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,168
Then how do you have the key to my café?

128
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:08,467
I accidentally picked it up.

129
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:10,171
Here, I'll give it back.

130
00:11:11,025 --> 00:11:12,178
Don't trust him, brother.

131
00:11:12,194 --> 00:11:13,808
Shi Wen, we should call the police.

132
00:11:13,832 --> 00:11:15,722
- Hey.
- Who are you, really?

133
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:16,913
If you don't tell us,

134
00:11:16,938 --> 00:11:17,950
I'll call the police for real.

135
00:11:17,988 --> 00:11:19,395
Put that down first.

136
00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:21,010
Okay, okay, I'll explain.

137
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,371
Actually... I lost my job.

138
00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:29,225
I wanted to work at the café.

139
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,505
I just need a temporary place to stay.

140
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,738
Work?

141
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:34,233
You came in the middle of the night

142
00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:35,931
looking for a job? Don't believe him!

143
00:11:35,955 --> 00:11:37,340
I swear, I'm not a bad person.

144
00:11:38,018 --> 00:11:40,410
I can leave my ID with you.

145
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:43,425
Shen Nan.

146
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,434
Come.

147
00:11:54,561 --> 00:11:56,035
Can we trust him?

148
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,145
I'm not a scammer,

149
00:11:57,153 --> 00:11:58,144
you have to believe me!

150
00:11:58,168 --> 00:11:59,246
Shut up.

151
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,169
My mom isn't here, and I can't

152
00:12:01,177 --> 00:12:02,857
manage everything alone.

153
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,074
Free labor, no pay needed.

154
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,918
Seems like there's no reason to say no.

155
00:12:08,418 --> 00:12:11,356
Plus, he does look kind of pitiful.

156
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,441
- Hey.
- Hey.

157
00:12:13,969 --> 00:12:15,387
You can stay here,

158
00:12:15,729 --> 00:12:18,340
but we'll hold onto your ID.

159
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,817
Who is it? What are you doing?

160
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,544
I came to get face wash.

161
00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:43,278
How do you know where I keep my stuff?

162
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,268
I accidentally saw it yesterday

163
00:12:45,277 --> 00:12:46,246
when I used the bathroom.

164
00:12:46,271 --> 00:12:47,934
Then remember to knock next time.

165
00:12:52,794 --> 00:12:54,479
I never needed to knock before.

166
00:12:55,171 --> 00:12:56,877
Do I need to knock now?

167
00:12:57,929 --> 00:12:59,057
Before?

168
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:05,119
Nothing. I'll grab your

169
00:13:05,127 --> 00:13:06,175
toothpaste for you.

170
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:09,057
No need! Get out, out, out!

171
00:13:21,688 --> 00:13:25,372
Oh my God, didn't he love neat and tidy?

172
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:27,609
It's such a mess.

173
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,288
It's everywhere.

174
00:14:01,562 --> 00:14:02,562
Hey!

175
00:14:02,569 --> 00:14:03,718
Why are you randomly entering

176
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:05,044
my room and touching my things?

177
00:14:05,069 --> 00:14:06,218
Your room is so messy.

178
00:14:06,242 --> 00:14:08,002
I was just trying to help you clean up!

179
00:14:08,026 --> 00:14:10,184
I don't like strangers in my room.

180
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:11,608
From now on, just focus on

181
00:14:11,632 --> 00:14:13,101
the downstairs café and guesthouse.

182
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,718
Don't do anything else.

183
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:17,170
Put that down and leave.

184
00:14:36,849 --> 00:14:38,096
Watch carefully.

185
00:14:38,226 --> 00:14:40,903
First, pour the milk into the coffee.

186
00:14:40,928 --> 00:14:42,608
Let it flow like this.

187
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:47,303
Then mix it to about 50–60%.

188
00:14:47,369 --> 00:14:49,454
Continue pouring from the center

189
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:51,728
outwards towards the two edges.

190
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:55,320
Finally, lift and finish it.

191
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:56,939
And like this,

192
00:14:56,955 --> 00:14:58,822
you get a basic heart shape.

193
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,101
Got it? Give it a try.

194
00:15:03,849 --> 00:15:05,374
Let me try.

195
00:15:21,451 --> 00:15:22,983
Not bad!

196
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,803
You've got some talent.

197
00:15:24,962 --> 00:15:26,459
Someone taught me before.

198
00:15:26,891 --> 00:15:28,584
He was a great teacher.

199
00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:32,329
Then let me teach you to make desserts.

200
00:15:32,354 --> 00:15:33,642
I already know desserts.

201
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:35,181
I can even make tiramisu.

202
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,587
Aren't these menu from my café?

203
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:48,298
It's pretty good, huh?

204
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:49,886
Not bad at all.

205
00:15:50,018 --> 00:15:51,120
Of course.

206
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,565
Hiring me, you've really

207
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:54,261
found yourself a gem.

208
00:15:55,096 --> 00:15:56,307
It's alright.

209
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,623
Perfect.

210
00:15:57,648 --> 00:15:59,655
I'll leave the café to you today.

211
00:15:59,686 --> 00:16:01,252
- I'm taking a day off.
- Mm.

212
00:16:01,369 --> 00:16:03,104
- You two, come with me to paint.
- Mm.

213
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,047
Do you think he's reliable?

214
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,917
Don't worry. He seems to

215
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:12,683
treat Shi Wen quite well.

216
00:16:13,258 --> 00:16:14,688
Let's go paint, big brother!

217
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,422
Come on. Let's go.

218
00:16:30,226 --> 00:16:31,855
Isn't this me?

219
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,316
Why does he have a portrait of me?

220
00:16:35,849 --> 00:16:38,176
He shouldn't have known me back then.

221
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,851
Could he have remembered me?

222
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:06,288
Shi Wen.

223
00:17:07,889 --> 00:17:08,904
This is a portrait

224
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,987
you drew of me, isn't it?

225
00:17:10,012 --> 00:17:12,053
Do you remember when you drew it?

226
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:14,344
It really does look exactly like you.

227
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:16,985
But I don't recall ever drawing you.

228
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,017
Think harder.

229
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,275
Is there any trace of me

230
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,314
in your memories?

231
00:17:22,095 --> 00:17:23,544
In my memories...

232
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:25,381
Should there be traces of you?

233
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,131
Of course not.

234
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,124
We didn't know each other before.

235
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:38,454
This drawing clearly was

236
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:40,159
drawn before we met.

237
00:17:40,577 --> 00:17:41,577
Could it be...

238
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:44,526
Could it be...

239
00:17:44,854 --> 00:17:47,077
that he had memories of me,

240
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,335
but temporarily forgot them?

241
00:18:04,577 --> 00:18:06,397
No need to examine it that closely.

242
00:18:06,422 --> 00:18:08,092
It's obvious that this is me.

243
00:18:08,136 --> 00:18:10,209
Huh? No. Look here,

244
00:18:10,258 --> 00:18:11,425
this part is different.

245
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,155
Your Adam's apple is bigger.

246
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:15,436
Exactly.

247
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,799
Look, you've got crow's feet

248
00:18:16,823 --> 00:18:17,998
around your eyes.

249
00:18:18,022 --> 00:18:19,452
But the drawing doesn't.

250
00:18:19,477 --> 00:18:20,505
Forget it.

251
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,225
With you two siblings in this world...

252
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,038
nothing strange seems impossible.

253
00:18:25,288 --> 00:18:27,608
Shi Wen will stop drawing.

254
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,776
Maybe he just drew it casually before.

255
00:18:29,801 --> 00:18:31,420
It just happens to resemble you.

256
00:18:31,474 --> 00:18:32,866
Why would he stop drawing?

257
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,144
He said he doesn't like drawing.

258
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:36,526
He only paints sometimes

259
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:37,902
to pass the time.

260
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,710
Boss! Boss!

261
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,585
There's a customer. Let me handle it.

262
00:18:44,001 --> 00:18:46,798
No, his dream is to paint.

263
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:49,940
- Jiang Yilin.
- Hmm?

264
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,525
Do me a favor. There's a big

265
00:18:51,533 --> 00:18:53,105
drawing competition in the city.

266
00:18:53,129 --> 00:18:54,945
The registration deadline has passed.

267
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,563
I heard you know someone

268
00:18:56,572 --> 00:18:58,009
on the organizing team.

269
00:18:58,409 --> 00:19:00,440
Help me get a competition pass.

270
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,745
Why should I help you?

271
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:02,863
You're not helping me.

272
00:19:02,895 --> 00:19:04,026
You're helping Shi Wen.

273
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,121
Don't you want to help him

274
00:19:05,137 --> 00:19:06,104
achieve his dream?

275
00:19:06,129 --> 00:19:07,512
I say, as an employee,

276
00:19:07,537 --> 00:19:09,937
you're being way too nice to Shi Wen.

277
00:19:10,124 --> 00:19:11,320
Do you have ulterior motives?

278
00:19:11,345 --> 00:19:12,948
- Are you helping or not?
- Nope.

279
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,581
You've got a mole on

280
00:19:21,589 --> 00:19:22,553
the left side of your butt.

281
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,104
Your WeChat payment password is 666888.

282
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:26,394
You've got a crush on three

283
00:19:26,418 --> 00:19:27,702
dancing girls in your hometown,

284
00:19:27,726 --> 00:19:29,445
but only one of them
pays attention to you.

285
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,796
- Usually, you...
- Hey.

286
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,904
How do you know all this?

287
00:19:33,928 --> 00:19:35,145
Did Shi Wen tell you?

288
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:36,601
Are you helping or not?

289
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:37,945
I'll help, I'll help!

290
00:19:38,129 --> 00:19:39,195
Help!

291
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,114
Shi Wen!

292
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,817
Look, what's this?

293
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:57,020
What is it?

294
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,316
A registration form

295
00:19:58,332 --> 00:19:59,426
for a paint competition!

296
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,512
I worked really hard to get it.

297
00:20:06,051 --> 00:20:09,129
(Paint Contest Entry Card)
(Contestant: Gu Shi Wen)

298
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,584
Why did you give it to me?

299
00:20:15,609 --> 00:20:16,945
Isn't painting your dream?

300
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,791
- So I just thought...
- Who told you painting was my dream?

301
00:20:20,913 --> 00:20:21,913
Huh?

302
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,178
I...

303
00:20:25,273 --> 00:20:26,452
Shen Nan.

304
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:28,788
Did you even ask me?

305
00:20:31,849 --> 00:20:33,700
Stop being so presumptuous, will you?

306
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,341
I just wanted to help you

307
00:20:36,366 --> 00:20:37,921
achieve your dream, that's all.

308
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,575
This competition

309
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,858
is a famous painting contest.

310
00:20:52,329 --> 00:20:53,929
If you succeed,

311
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,531
your work will definitely

312
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:58,236
be seen by more people.

313
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,616
Who told you my dream

314
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:08,063
was to become an artist?

315
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,210
Shi Wen.

316
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,550
Drawing is your dream.

317
00:21:34,129 --> 00:21:35,144
Is there anything wrong

318
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,205
with pursuing your dream?

319
00:21:36,246 --> 00:21:37,386
Even if it is my dream,

320
00:21:37,395 --> 00:21:38,865
it has nothing to do with you.

321
00:21:38,889 --> 00:21:40,659
You're just an employee.

322
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:42,093
What gives you the right

323
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:43,421
to interfere in my life?

324
00:21:43,691 --> 00:21:45,639
If I'd wanted to join the competition,

325
00:21:45,664 --> 00:21:47,997
I'd have registered myself already!

326
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,987
Stop making assumptions.

327
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:54,197
Shen Nan, we've only known

328
00:21:54,228 --> 00:21:55,634
each other for two days.

329
00:21:57,089 --> 00:21:59,218
Please stop meddling in my life!

330
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:36,676
Shi Wen,

331
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,586
I'm sorry.

332
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,852
I didn't consider your feelings.

333
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,050
I just...

334
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,750
Just what?

335
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:48,975
Did you think this would help me?

336
00:22:56,246 --> 00:22:57,327
I'm sorry.

337
00:22:58,956 --> 00:23:00,708
I really didn't mean it.

338
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:08,936
The truth is,

339
00:23:08,961 --> 00:23:10,475
I can never become an artist!

340
00:23:11,732 --> 00:23:14,992
I can't even distinguish basic colors!

341
00:23:16,794 --> 00:23:18,231
How could someone like me

342
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,786
possibly become an artist?

343
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:44,770
It's all my fault.

344
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,169
I didn't know.

345
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:49,996
It's all my fault.

346
00:24:50,445 --> 00:24:51,445
Mm.

347
00:24:51,881 --> 00:24:53,304
Have some honey water.

348
00:25:00,889 --> 00:25:04,049
Son, drink some honey water.

349
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:17,534
Why are you staring at me?

350
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:22,472
Nothing, it just reminded me of my mom.

351
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,003
Why?

352
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,530
When I wasn't feeling well,

353
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,659
she'd make honey water for me too.

354
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:35,091
Can you tell me what happened to you?

355
00:25:39,141 --> 00:25:40,305
Actually, it's fine if you

356
00:25:40,313 --> 00:25:41,844
don't want to talk about it.

357
00:25:42,609 --> 00:25:43,772
After all...

358
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,335
I'm just an employee.

359
00:25:46,369 --> 00:25:49,512
Not even a friend, just an employee.

360
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:55,210
Actually, I'm colorblind.

361
00:26:00,889 --> 00:26:02,387
Colorblind?

362
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:04,786
You...

363
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,075
How come...

364
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,121
My dad hit me.

365
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:13,762
Whether I drink or not

366
00:26:13,778 --> 00:26:15,105
is none of your business!

367
00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:17,552
Shi Wen's napping. Keep your voice down.

368
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:18,778
How can we go on if you

369
00:26:18,794 --> 00:26:20,026
drink like this every day?

370
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,444
- Shut up!
- Oww!

371
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:23,082
What right do you have

372
00:26:23,098 --> 00:26:24,506
to talk to me like that?

373
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,085
Dad, don't hit Mom!

374
00:26:26,129 --> 00:26:27,436
Get out of the way!

375
00:26:27,657 --> 00:26:28,937
Shi Wen!

376
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:31,829
Shi Wen!

377
00:26:33,849 --> 00:26:35,708
How can you do this to him?

378
00:26:35,716 --> 00:26:36,836
He's your son!

379
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,009
You two useless fools.

380
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,189
Today...

381
00:26:40,409 --> 00:26:42,609
Today, I'll beat you both to death!

382
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:43,745
No!

383
00:26:43,823 --> 00:26:45,156
- No! Stop!
- Beat you both to death!

384
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,274
- Beat you both to death!
- Oww!

385
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:48,634
- Beat you both to death!
- Dad, stop hitting us!

386
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,609
Why? Why are you doing this to us?

387
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:54,431
I just want to protect Mom!

388
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,075
So,

389
00:26:58,697 --> 00:27:00,376
from that time on...

390
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:04,431
My optic nerves were damaged.

391
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:06,654
I haven't been able to distinguish

392
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:08,270
red and green since.

393
00:27:09,409 --> 00:27:11,415
Let alone paint.

394
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:13,849
So,

395
00:27:14,389 --> 00:27:15,645
thank you.

396
00:27:28,803 --> 00:27:30,631
You'll get better.

397
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,185
I hope these colors

398
00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:52,365
can help you see a different world.

399
00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:07,232
Why have the flowers changed color?

400
00:28:08,409 --> 00:28:09,662
You're here.

401
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,076
Do you like it?

402
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,389
This is a surprise from me.

403
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,398
It's been so long since

404
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:27,718
I've seen colors like this.

405
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,447
I asked the doctor and

406
00:28:34,472 --> 00:28:35,947
found these colored papers.

407
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,828
They're fake,

408
00:28:38,129 --> 00:28:39,207
but I wanted you to

409
00:28:39,215 --> 00:28:40,714
remember the colors again.

410
00:28:45,522 --> 00:28:46,522
You...

411
00:28:47,498 --> 00:28:49,001
Why are you doing this?

412
00:28:50,107 --> 00:28:52,009
I want to make you a bit more happy.

413
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,845
Hello. Here's your coffee.

414
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,205
Thank you.

415
00:29:07,065 --> 00:29:09,201
Why are these flowers so weird-looking?

416
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,431
True.

417
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,744
These are our shop's specialty.

418
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,314
What a great drawing.

419
00:29:36,354 --> 00:29:38,034
You really have talent.

420
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,845
Stop kidding, I just outlined it.

421
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,455
I haven't started painting yet.

422
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,181
Really? I think it looks

423
00:29:44,206 --> 00:29:45,886
pretty good already.

424
00:29:51,609 --> 00:29:53,983
Can you get me a glass of water?

425
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:58,655
Didn't you just have one?

426
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:03,163
No more drawing today.

427
00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:05,867
Okay, then I'll take you

428
00:30:05,892 --> 00:30:07,087
to collect information.

429
00:30:11,781 --> 00:30:14,378
Alright, lead the way then.

430
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:31,970
Shi Wen.

431
00:30:32,849 --> 00:30:34,067
Take a picture for me.

432
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:35,369
Sure.

433
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:40,824
Isn't this Enya's camera?

434
00:30:40,849 --> 00:30:41,971
Why do you have it?

435
00:30:42,026 --> 00:30:43,471
She wanted me to take some

436
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,448
photos for her, so she left it with me.

437
00:30:46,521 --> 00:30:47,521
I'll take one for you.

438
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:49,577
Great, let me strike a pose.

439
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,929
Wow, this is...

440
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,490
Shi Wen, look.

441
00:31:01,129 --> 00:31:02,436
That rice field.

442
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:05,022
- Can you sense its color?
- Mm.

443
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:07,185
The green of the rice field.

444
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,889
The blue of the sky.

445
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,369
And...

446
00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:20,129
And what?

447
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:28,440
Come on, let's take pictures over there.

448
00:31:46,929 --> 00:31:48,514
- Push me.
- Sure.

449
00:31:49,369 --> 00:31:50,561
Hold tight!

450
00:32:14,129 --> 00:32:15,129
Shi Wen.

451
00:32:15,877 --> 00:32:17,072
Let's take some photos.

452
00:32:17,097 --> 00:32:18,158
Alright.

453
00:32:18,929 --> 00:32:20,544
Take a few of me by the river.

454
00:32:20,569 --> 00:32:21,587
Okay.

455
00:32:42,004 --> 00:32:43,551
Shen Nan,

456
00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:45,283
thank you!

457
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:46,744
I've truly been happy

458
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:48,369
these past few days!

459
00:32:49,849 --> 00:32:51,293
As long as you're happy,

460
00:32:51,454 --> 00:32:53,239
I'm willing to do anything.

461
00:32:54,983 --> 00:32:55,983
Huh?

462
00:33:02,929 --> 00:33:04,091
It's nothing.

463
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,966
Let's head to the next spot.

464
00:33:09,329 --> 00:33:10,396
Let's go.

465
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,966
What are you doing? It's a red light!

466
00:33:28,169 --> 00:33:29,908
I've been crossing like this for years.

467
00:33:29,933 --> 00:33:31,197
Don't worry about it.

468
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:32,973
Gu Shi Wen!

469
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,521
When crossing the road,

470
00:33:35,545 --> 00:33:36,693
you must distinguish between

471
00:33:36,701 --> 00:33:37,786
green and red lights.

472
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,809
Be sure to look carefully.

473
00:33:41,556 --> 00:33:43,369
Got it.

474
00:33:50,942 --> 00:33:52,745
Why did you bring me here?

475
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:54,457
It's already been checked before.

476
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:56,399
There's no way to recover it.

477
00:33:56,428 --> 00:33:57,979
Come on. What if it works?

478
00:33:58,004 --> 00:33:59,675
I contacted an ophthalmologist overseas.

479
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,738
They said we need

480
00:34:00,763 --> 00:34:02,026
to send over some scans.

481
00:34:02,057 --> 00:34:03,504
It's fine.

482
00:34:04,129 --> 00:34:05,785
I've already adapted for so many years.

483
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,269
Besides, the coffee shop and

484
00:34:07,293 --> 00:34:09,066
guesthouse keep me so busy.

485
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,680
I don't have time to paint.

486
00:34:10,705 --> 00:34:12,637
I don't even like painting that much.

487
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,625
Alright, let's go back for dinner, okay?

488
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:18,793
Go, go.

489
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:48,625
Look at your expression.

490
00:34:48,658 --> 00:34:50,531
Before, you need had glasses.

491
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:51,912
This time, I asked

492
00:34:51,928 --> 00:34:53,305
my doctor friend overseas.

493
00:34:53,329 --> 00:34:54,844
It's custom-made just for you.

494
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:56,617
With this,

495
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,625
you'll be able to see colors better.

496
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:02,133
And you can keep painting in the future.

497
00:35:02,529 --> 00:35:03,640
Shen Nan,

498
00:35:04,049 --> 00:35:06,000
why are you so good to me?

499
00:35:20,009 --> 00:35:21,969
Why are you so good to me?

500
00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:26,289
If I say,

501
00:35:27,409 --> 00:35:29,414
it's out of

502
00:35:30,449 --> 00:35:31,570
friendship...

503
00:35:32,889 --> 00:35:34,125
Would you believe me?

504
00:35:35,849 --> 00:35:37,049
But...

505
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,789
This obviously goes beyond friendship.

506
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:45,445
Then I'll tell you now.

507
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:03,484
My hands are dirty.

508
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:06,539
Oh.

509
00:36:09,449 --> 00:36:11,234
I used to have a younger brother.

510
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:13,390
He also loved painting.

511
00:36:14,009 --> 00:36:15,281
But later...

512
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:18,062
there was an accident.

513
00:36:19,329 --> 00:36:21,075
He never got the chance

514
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,505
to continue painting.

515
00:36:23,369 --> 00:36:24,968
Every time I see you,

516
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,952
I think of him.

517
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:29,742
I have regrets about him.

518
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,091
So I thought,

519
00:36:33,497 --> 00:36:35,146
maybe I could make up for

520
00:36:36,109 --> 00:36:37,896
those regrets with you here.

521
00:36:39,969 --> 00:36:41,336
Well, I guess

522
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:43,277
it's you're thanking me then.

523
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:48,775
I didn't expect you to

524
00:36:48,783 --> 00:36:50,220
be so thick-skinned.

525
00:36:50,755 --> 00:36:51,755
Huh?

526
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,011
Haven't your eyes gotten tired

527
00:37:13,027 --> 00:37:14,237
after staring so long?

528
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,770
Time to take a break.

529
00:37:18,258 --> 00:37:19,395
What are you doing?

530
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:25,747
Lie down.

531
00:37:31,529 --> 00:37:33,317
Let me give you a massage.

532
00:37:44,369 --> 00:37:45,409
Feel good?

533
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,032
Yeah, pretty good.

534
00:37:48,105 --> 00:37:50,688
Except you're almost poking my eyes out.

535
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,040
Oh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

536
00:37:54,369 --> 00:37:55,798
Here, hold my phone.

537
00:37:55,849 --> 00:37:57,743
Let me look up a tutorial.

538
00:37:59,449 --> 00:38:00,501
Lie down.

539
00:38:01,009 --> 00:38:03,376
This time, I'll massage perfectly.

540
00:38:09,049 --> 00:38:11,657
Shen Nan, you're so serious about this...

541
00:38:11,737 --> 00:38:14,110
I feel bad for not giving you a raise.

542
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,579
I don't want a a salary.

543
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,585
I just want you to...

544
00:38:18,617 --> 00:38:20,555
agree to join the painting competition.

545
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,474
But...

546
00:38:25,318 --> 00:38:27,478
I don't know if I can do it.

547
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,157
It's just a competition.

548
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:31,970
It's okay even if you lose.

549
00:38:32,049 --> 00:38:33,585
The main thing is to gain experience.

550
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,145
With these glasses,

551
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,806
you can paint for life.

552
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:38,818
But we

553
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,348
need to take that first step.

554
00:38:42,049 --> 00:38:43,210
Right?

555
00:39:02,849 --> 00:39:05,225
You don't want to go? It's okay at all.

556
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,076
We can just make coffee here.

557
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:08,545
I calculated it,

558
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:11,709
we can make coffee for another 60 years.

559
00:39:12,009 --> 00:39:13,420
So you mean

560
00:39:13,449 --> 00:39:14,519
I have to make coffee

561
00:39:14,535 --> 00:39:15,464
for you for a lifetime?

562
00:39:15,489 --> 00:39:17,003
I'm just temporarily helping

563
00:39:17,028 --> 00:39:18,708
my mom manage the store.

564
00:39:20,449 --> 00:39:22,045
So what do you want to do?

565
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:29,003
Looks like these glasses

566
00:39:29,012 --> 00:39:30,305
won't be useful then.

567
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:31,839
I had to go through a lot

568
00:39:31,864 --> 00:39:33,664
of connections to get them.

569
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:35,990
What if I sell it?

570
00:39:36,049 --> 00:39:37,443
How much will I get?

571
00:39:37,489 --> 00:39:38,745
I'll go!

572
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:39,904
- Shen Nan,
- Huh?

573
00:39:39,929 --> 00:39:41,840
Who gives something away
and then takes it back?

574
00:39:41,865 --> 00:39:42,889
Give it to me quickly.

575
00:39:42,906 --> 00:39:44,586
Shen Nan, give it to me.

576
00:39:44,969 --> 00:39:46,009
Give it to me.

577
00:39:47,531 --> 00:39:49,334
- You guys,
- Give it to me!

578
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,306
Is something wrong?

579
00:39:53,961 --> 00:39:55,094
The coffee's here.

580
00:39:55,102 --> 00:39:56,786
You guys go check the stuff.

581
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:57,978
I'll go.

582
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:15,314
Shi Wen,

583
00:40:16,228 --> 00:40:17,457
your painting is getting

584
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:18,782
better and better.

585
00:40:18,806 --> 00:40:20,197
Wow, Shi Wen,

586
00:40:20,353 --> 00:40:22,145
I didn't expect you to improve so much.

587
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:23,638
So many years,

588
00:40:23,663 --> 00:40:25,038
when did you secretly practice?

589
00:40:25,062 --> 00:40:27,065
Brother, it's just you don't know this,

590
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,636
Shi Wen's sketches

591
00:40:28,661 --> 00:40:30,528
were often copied by others.

592
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:31,871
Looks like we're going to

593
00:40:31,879 --> 00:40:33,218
be friends with a great artist.

594
00:40:33,242 --> 00:40:35,785
- Mm.
- Next time when you eat, it's free.

595
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,386
Next time at the restaurant,

596
00:40:37,395 --> 00:40:38,945
I'll take lots of pictures.

597
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:41,303
Maybe later you'll have fans coming.

598
00:40:41,329 --> 00:40:43,943
Then my restaurant will be a hit.

599
00:40:44,329 --> 00:40:46,623
Brother, don't flatter me.

600
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,705
There are many people better than me.

601
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,105
If you're really my friend,

602
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,653
next time I come to your restaurant,

603
00:40:51,669 --> 00:40:53,036
give me a discount.

604
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:54,409
Shen Nan.

605
00:40:54,529 --> 00:40:56,232
Then take good care

606
00:40:56,263 --> 00:40:57,997
of our Shi Wen from now on.

607
00:40:58,049 --> 00:40:59,570
Let's go, let's go eat.

608
00:40:59,604 --> 00:41:01,730
- Let's go.
- I'm not going for the meal.

609
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:04,232
I have a competition in a week.

610
00:41:04,257 --> 00:41:05,974
I want to practice more.

Gu Shi Wen.

615
00:41:32,009 --> 00:41:34,821
Shi Wen, your painting was selected!

616
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,500
That's great! I thought

617
00:41:36,508 --> 00:41:38,188
I wouldn't be selected.

618
00:41:38,492 --> 00:41:39,437
When I get back,

619
00:41:39,445 --> 00:41:40,500
I'll celebrate with you.

620
00:41:40,524 --> 00:41:42,449
- Oh, Shi Wen.
- Shi Wen.

621
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:44,117
Isn't that the colorblind guy

622
00:41:44,133 --> 00:41:45,186
from our class?

623
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,297
- He actually got selected?
- He got selected.

624
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:49,257
His skill is terrible

625
00:41:49,266 --> 00:41:51,023
and he calls himself an artist.

626
00:41:51,766 --> 00:41:53,593
- With this little skill?
- With this skill,

627
00:41:53,618 --> 00:41:54,625
he dares to enter a competition?

628
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:56,423
- Exactly.
- Yeah, isn't he afraid people

629
00:41:56,439 --> 00:41:57,915
will know he's colorblind?

630
00:42:00,204 --> 00:42:01,204
Hey.

631
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:04,719
Looks like you three

632
00:42:05,009 --> 00:42:07,009
bullied Shi Wen before, huh?

633
00:42:07,049 --> 00:42:08,297
Who are you?

634
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:10,688
What's it to you? Get lost.

635
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:13,039
Kid, you want to die?

636
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,703
Daring to cause trouble on our turf?

637
00:42:17,529 --> 00:42:20,828
Gu Shi Wen's matter is my matter.

(Next episode)

639
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,490
What happened?

640
00:43:29,489 --> 00:43:30,975
Nothing much.

641
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:32,030
Shen Nan,

642
00:43:32,055 --> 00:43:33,649
why does the wound on

643
00:43:33,657 --> 00:43:35,524
your face and my brother's...

644
00:43:37,831 --> 00:43:40,042
- Umm... A cat scratched me.
- Umm... I got into a fight.

645
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,606
Slow down.

646
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,528
I'm not drunk, I can walk.

647
00:43:49,849 --> 00:43:51,505
Jiang Yilin can't drink either.

648
00:43:51,537 --> 00:43:53,025
He said he'd beat me.

649
00:43:53,049 --> 00:43:54,944
Yeah, yeah, you're the best at drinking.

650
00:43:54,969 --> 00:43:57,344
Shi Wen, the great artist, is the best.

651
00:43:57,369 --> 00:43:58,464
Slow down, slow down.

652
00:43:58,489 --> 00:44:00,362
- You'll fall.
- I'm not drunk, I can walk.

653
00:44:01,242 --> 00:44:02,521
Be careful.
