1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,519
Come, stand here.
I'll take a picture of you.

2
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:16,519
Okay, okay.

3
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:18,039
Turn your head this way.

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,840
Yes, yes, yes.

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,800
The sunlight is really nice today.

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,599
Three, two, one.

7
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:25,679
I see you again.

8
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:27,760
You, at 30 years old.

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,480
How are you?

10
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:31,119
Happy birthday.

11
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:33,760
Stand up straight.

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,239
Look at this one.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,199
The wind makes it look really good.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
"I'll Turn Back This time" Special Episode
(The Eleventh Letter)

15
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,559
My name is Gu Shi Wen.

16
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,960
Every year on my birthday,

17
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:52,280
I receive a letter from a passerby.

18
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,480
Counting the years,

19
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,000
it's been 11 years now.

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,519
Every cold winter, this passerby

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,559
brings me warmth once again.

22
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:08,039
Maybe this is one of the few reasons

23
00:01:08,199 --> 00:01:09,599
I look forward to winter.

24
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,920
This passerby...

25
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,360
What kind of person are they?

26
00:01:15,559 --> 00:01:16,599
Are they male?

27
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:17,800
Or female?

28
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:20,800
Are they nimble and smart?

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,119
Are they a very artistic person?

30
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,000
Are they cheerful and lively?

31
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:29,800
I think...

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,360
fate in this world is fleeting.

33
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,013
The bonds between people

34
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,039
are hard to measure.

35
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,199
Or perhaps

36
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:42,199
you come from a parallel universe,

37
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,119
and just so happened

38
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,639
to meet the version of me in this one.

39
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,880
This non-existent passerby,

40
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,559
I always feel that somehow,

41
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:59,559
we share a special connection.

42
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,760
Or maybe,

43
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,559
this is just my wishful thinking.

44
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,039
In the end, we will drift apart,

45
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,320
lost in the river of time.

46
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,280
If

47
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,000
we were to meet,

48
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,400
would I recognize you?

49
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,480
Or would we

50
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:36,039
just pass by each other?

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,920
I keep hoping that one day,

52
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,199
we will finally meet.

53
00:03:59,199 --> 00:03:59,960
Shen Nan.

54
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,633
How long do you plan on

55
00:04:08,654 --> 00:04:09,900
pretending not to know me?

56
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,639
Three, two, one.

57
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,559
Okay, that's good.

58
00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:28,480
Watch your step.

59
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:20,320
Idiot.

60
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,719
Shen Nan!

61
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,079
Wait for me.

62
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,320
Hurry up.

63
00:05:58,719 --> 00:05:59,599
Are you cold?

64
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:01,840
Shen Nan.

65
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:04,072
Suddenly, I’ve started looking

66
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,252
forward to winter.

67
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:08,605
I remember you never

68
00:06:08,646 --> 00:06:09,752
really liked winter.

69
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,800
Yeah.

70
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:15,400
Because in the past winter,

71
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:16,532
I never received the

72
00:06:16,546 --> 00:06:17,545
thing that I truly want.

73
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,501
But now, in this winter,

74
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,239
I have it.

75
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:26,960
Shen Nan.

76
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,079
Yes.

77
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:45,920
What?

78
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,159
Remember you.
