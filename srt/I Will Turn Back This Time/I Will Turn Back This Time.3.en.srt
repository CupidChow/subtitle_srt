(I'll Turn Back This Time)

2
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,668
(Episode 3)

3
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,301
Tonight, we're not stopping

4
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,700
until we're drunk!

5
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,004
Alright!

6
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,280
By the way,

7
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,285
what were you up to earlier?

8
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,996
Why are you only back now?

9
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,644
That old man at the fish stall, no,

10
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,781
I almost got into a fight

11
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:09,847
with the old fish seller.

12
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:12,137
I went to the market to buy a fish,

13
00:01:12,162 --> 00:01:13,427
and he gave me a dead one.

14
00:01:13,451 --> 00:01:15,096
Do you think I could let that slide?

15
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,054
He insisted it was alive, but

16
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,901
I told him it was already belly-up! I...

17
00:01:18,926 --> 00:01:20,584
So, what were you really doing?

18
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:25,137
Nothing.

19
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:26,952
Nothing? Then what's with

20
00:01:26,968 --> 00:01:28,648
that cut on your lip?

21
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:30,694
Don't tell me you actually

22
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:31,755
fought with him?

23
00:01:31,779 --> 00:01:32,974
No way, why would I

24
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,670
fight an old fish seller?

25
00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:38,580
What?

26
00:01:42,339 --> 00:01:43,975
Why are you so worried about me?

27
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,647
Me?

28
00:01:45,699 --> 00:01:47,045
Worried about you?

29
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:48,928
I was just curious, that's all.

30
00:01:49,059 --> 00:01:50,973
Besides, how does someone hit

31
00:01:50,998 --> 00:01:53,531
the floor and cut their lip like that?

32
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:54,990
Really?

33
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:58,522
Let me tell you,

34
00:01:59,779 --> 00:02:01,435
this doesn't count as workplace injury.

35
00:02:02,529 --> 00:02:03,888
Why do you sound like such

36
00:02:03,896 --> 00:02:05,630
a capitalist at your age?

37
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,486
This should be enough,

38
00:02:20,502 --> 00:02:22,314
they probably prepared a lot too.

39
00:02:23,355 --> 00:02:25,281
Congratulations, Shi Wen,
our great artist!

40
00:02:25,306 --> 00:02:26,889
You even brought so much.
I told you not to.

41
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:28,155
- Thank you!
- Because it's not enough.

42
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,619
- Do you like it?
- Just set it down.

43
00:02:29,644 --> 00:02:30,549
Your presence is enough.

44
00:02:30,574 --> 00:02:32,314
You didn't have to bring anything.

45
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:37,709
Shen Nan,

46
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:38,990
how come that wound on

47
00:02:38,999 --> 00:02:40,600
your face and my brother's...

48
00:02:43,324 --> 00:02:45,738
- Umm... A cat scratched me.
- Umm... I got into a fight.

49
00:02:45,946 --> 00:02:46,946
Huh?

50
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:51,785
Shen Nan.

51
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:53,693
Didn't you just tell me it was

52
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,545
from fighting the fish seller?

53
00:02:55,853 --> 00:02:58,035
Why is it now a cat scratch?

54
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,242
Jiang Yilin.

55
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,266
Huh?

56
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,395
What's going on, brother?

57
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,034
Here's the truth,

58
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:12,644
Shen Nan heard someone badmouthing

59
00:03:12,668 --> 00:03:13,714
you behind your back.

60
00:03:13,738 --> 00:03:16,402
It really upset him. So...

61
00:03:16,427 --> 00:03:17,777
Alright.

62
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,927
It's in the past.

63
00:03:18,935 --> 00:03:20,075
No need to bring it up.

64
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,674
So, you're like this...

65
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,307
You did it for me?

66
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,379
Yes.

67
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,057
Someone talked trash,

68
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:29,395
so we had to teach them a lesson!

69
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,239
In that case, I support you.

70
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:32,872
It's fine. The troublemakers

71
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,355
already got what they deserved.

72
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:35,622
Why talk about this?

73
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,995
Let's eat hot pot!

74
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,996
Let's not destroy

75
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:39,195
a nice atmosphere, okay?

76
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,995
Come on, come on, let's dig in.

77
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,367
Let's all celebrate Shi Wen,

78
00:03:42,383 --> 00:03:43,743
our great artist!

79
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:46,667
- Come.
- Cheers!

80
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,099
Dig in, dig in. I'm starving!

81
00:03:52,124 --> 00:03:53,354
The meatballs are done. Eat up!

82
00:03:53,386 --> 00:03:54,820
I've been eyeing them for so long!

83
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:57,134
Let me grab one.

84
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,290
Sure.

85
00:03:58,525 --> 00:03:59,525
Hey.

86
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,900
Take it slow.

87
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,884
I'm not drunk, I can walk.

88
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,793
Jiang Yilin can't drink either.

89
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:09,396
He said he'd beat me.

90
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,354
Yeah, yeah, you're the best at drinking.

91
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:13,754
Shi Wen, the great artist, is the best!

92
00:04:13,779 --> 00:04:14,899
Slow down, slow down.

93
00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:17,126
- Almost there.
- I'm not drunk, I can walk.

94
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,060
Be careful.

95
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,900
(Episode 3: I Stepped on Your Shadow)

96
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,659
Does it still hurt?

97
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,580
It doesn't hurt.

98
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:50,362
I've been fighting since I was a kid.

99
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,042
This is nothing.

100
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,299
Sit still.

101
00:05:06,179 --> 00:05:07,260
Shen Nan.

102
00:05:07,363 --> 00:05:08,363
Hmm?

103
00:05:10,179 --> 00:05:11,464
When I was a kid...

104
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:13,995
I used to get bullied.

105
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,238
I always hoped my dad

106
00:05:16,247 --> 00:05:17,927
would stand up for me.

107
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,933
But I never thought...

108
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,972
Today, it'd be you standing up for me.

109
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:27,542
Don't worry.

110
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:30,237
I'll always protect you from now on.

111
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:33,539
Shen Nan.

112
00:05:33,645 --> 00:05:34,645
Hmm?

113
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:35,956
Let me ask you.

114
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,847
Why are you so good to me?

115
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:45,419
You're so good to me that...

116
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:48,197
I feel like we're more

117
00:05:48,213 --> 00:05:49,653
than just friends.

118
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:54,299
Shi Wen...

119
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,060
You're drunk.

120
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,503
I'm not drunk.

121
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,269
I'm perfectly clear.

122
00:06:05,971 --> 00:06:07,012
Shen Nan.

123
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,020
Your feelings

124
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,099
for me

125
00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:17,659
have changed, right?

126
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:23,219
Yes.

127
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:25,739
I told you.

128
00:06:27,515 --> 00:06:29,426
I've always thought of you as

129
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,580
my brother.

130
00:06:37,739 --> 00:06:39,992
You know that's not what I mean.

131
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:42,900
Shen Nan.

132
00:06:43,924 --> 00:06:44,952
I'm asking you.

133
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,580
Do you...

134
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,419
Like me?

135
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:54,539
Shi Wen...

136
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,820
I...

137
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,429
I know what you wanted to do that day.

138
00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:38,915
Their guesthouse is amazing!

139
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,769
- Really?
- Their coffee is incredible!

140
00:07:40,803 --> 00:07:41,920
Gu Shi Wen actually knows

141
00:07:41,945 --> 00:07:42,938
how to run a coffee shop?

142
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:43,974
You can't believe it?

143
00:07:43,983 --> 00:07:45,404
Shi Wen, look who's here.

144
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,292
Du Ze!

145
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,066
My classmate, it's really you.

146
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,651
Yilin told me you opened a café here.

147
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:56,641
I couldn't believe it.

148
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,299
Gosh. It's been so many years,

149
00:07:58,324 --> 00:08:00,175
- and you've changed so much.
- Mm.

150
00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:01,634
I ran into him by the river.

151
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:03,144
He said he needed a place to stay,

152
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,394
so I brought him over.

153
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,739
Gu Shi Wen,

154
00:08:06,187 --> 00:08:07,456
it's been so long,

155
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,691
but you're still as adorable as ever.

156
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:12,395
Been a long time for you two indeed.

157
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,791
So lively here.

158
00:08:13,816 --> 00:08:15,938
Right, Shen Nan, let me introduce you.

159
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:17,744
This is my best, best, best friend

160
00:08:17,768 --> 00:08:19,383
from high school, Du Ze.

161
00:08:19,407 --> 00:08:20,595
Du Ze, this is Shen Nan,

162
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,940
my friend and big brother.

163
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,380
Big brother?

164
00:08:27,218 --> 00:08:28,218
Oh.

165
00:08:28,435 --> 00:08:29,435
Hello.

166
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,299
I am Gu Shi Wen's elegant,

167
00:08:31,324 --> 00:08:33,394
charming, handsome, competent

168
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,850
and dashing best classmate

169
00:08:34,858 --> 00:08:36,420
from high school,

170
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,299
Du Ze.

171
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,804
Nice to meet you.

172
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,350
Hey Shi Wen,

173
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,429
do you remember?

174
00:09:02,445 --> 00:09:03,876
That time on our class outing,

175
00:09:03,907 --> 00:09:05,850
I almost became an explorer.

176
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,095
In the end, you were

177
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:08,716
the one who saved the day.

178
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,115
Of course I remember.

179
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,794
I was so scared for you that time,

180
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:13,315
worried you'd get hurt.

181
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,235
You two have so many stories together.

182
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,371
What I remember the most

183
00:09:16,403 --> 00:09:17,635
was that basketball game.

184
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:18,794
Our class was down by two points,

185
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:20,154
and there were only three seconds left.

186
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:21,179
Shi Wen passed to you, and

187
00:09:21,195 --> 00:09:22,316
you ran like crazy for a three-pointer.

188
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,900
My heart nearly stopped.

189
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,860
Then the buzzer sounded, and it went in.

190
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,394
You were amazing!

191
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:28,426
Without you, we wouldn't

192
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,395
have won the championship.

193
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:30,914
- Yes.
- That shot only went in

194
00:09:30,939 --> 00:09:32,154
because of Shi Wen.

195
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:33,801
He always knew the best place

196
00:09:33,825 --> 00:09:34,880
to pass the ball,

197
00:09:34,904 --> 00:09:36,066
perfect timing.

198
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,179
That's called…

199
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:39,362
chemistry.

200
00:09:43,528 --> 00:09:44,528
Umm...

201
00:09:44,539 --> 00:09:45,953
By the way, Shen Nan is

202
00:09:45,977 --> 00:09:47,903
really good at basketball too.

203
00:09:47,927 --> 00:09:49,179
You two should play against

204
00:09:49,195 --> 00:09:50,466
each other someday.

205
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,793
Why wait?

206
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,539
Let's play now.

207
00:09:54,557 --> 00:09:56,176
Today's not great for it.

208
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,275
Sit down first.

209
00:09:57,284 --> 00:09:59,217
Some other time, another day.

210
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,939
Yeah, another time!

211
00:10:03,355 --> 00:10:05,299
Do you remember that time

212
00:10:05,324 --> 00:10:06,554
I bought a puppy?

213
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:08,186
The dorm matron wouldn't let me keep it,

214
00:10:08,211 --> 00:10:09,243
so I asked Jiang Yilin
to hide it for me

215
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:10,587
and brought it into the dorm.

216
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:11,625
I hid it so well,

217
00:10:11,642 --> 00:10:13,005
afraid the matron would find out.

218
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,547
- Hey. That dog
- Huh?

219
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:16,475
- bit me!
- Not just bit you,

220
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,034
but also pooped on your bed!

221
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:19,105
It can't be helped.

222
00:10:19,114 --> 00:10:20,832
Where else could I put it? Right?

223
00:10:21,293 --> 00:10:23,100
Hey. Don't leave yet.

224
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,832
I'll show you a magic trick!

225
00:10:25,606 --> 00:10:26,871
Alright, a magic trick!

226
00:10:26,896 --> 00:10:27,896
Come.

227
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:32,355
- Look here.
- Mm.

228
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,668
I can make this disappear.

229
00:10:34,894 --> 00:10:36,605
Still here. Still here.

230
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,340
Still here.

231
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:47,100
Still here.

232
00:10:53,939 --> 00:10:55,777
- Where did you hide it?
- Huh...

233
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,380
It's really gone.

234
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,551
Gone, right?

235
00:10:58,596 --> 00:11:00,613
Gone, right? Where is it?

236
00:11:01,205 --> 00:11:02,558
Don't move.

237
00:11:04,214 --> 00:11:05,214
Oh!

238
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,980
How did you turn it into

239
00:11:06,988 --> 00:11:07,981
a milk powder scoop?

240
00:11:08,005 --> 00:11:09,605
- Don't mind it.
- Can you teach me?

241
00:11:12,293 --> 00:11:13,867
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

242
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,154
- It's okay, it's okay.
- I'm sorry.

243
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:16,659
It's just spilled coffee, no problem.

244
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,168
I didn't mean to.

245
00:11:18,204 --> 00:11:20,283
How about I make you a new one?

246
00:11:20,316 --> 00:11:22,058
No, no, no. It's fine.

247
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,573
I recently learned a special blend

248
00:11:23,597 --> 00:11:24,420
that tastes amazing.

249
00:11:24,444 --> 00:11:25,634
- Wait for me.
- Hey.

250
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:27,371
How about I make it instead?

251
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:35,958
Shi Wen only drinks the coffee I make.

252
00:11:37,303 --> 00:11:38,699
What's wrong with Shen Nan today?

253
00:11:38,724 --> 00:11:40,239
It's like he's possessed.

254
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,655
Then can you only drink

255
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,111
the coffee I make?

256
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,577
It's fine. That was about

257
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:07,962
to expire anyway.

258
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,955
I suggest we go for a picnic tomorrow.

259
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,209
How about it?

260
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,427
Shen Nan, are you ready?

261
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,709
Then go catch a couple of fish.

262
00:12:28,771 --> 00:12:29,771
Alright.

263
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,539
Shi Wen.

264
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:33,154
Come help me start the fire.

265
00:12:33,213 --> 00:12:34,220
Okay.

266
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:37,701
Enya.

267
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,255
Enya.

268
00:12:39,787 --> 00:12:41,309
Make sure to wash it clean.

269
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,260
Is it hot?

270
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,260
It's hot.

271
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,575
Shenan, I'll show you what I've got.

272
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,075
The pork belly is delicious.

273
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,653
- That's pork belly?
- Yeah.

274
00:13:15,864 --> 00:13:16,864
Hey.

275
00:13:17,132 --> 00:13:19,178
This is the soup of high school memories

276
00:13:19,203 --> 00:13:20,803
I made for everyone.

277
00:13:21,586 --> 00:13:22,867
Come try it!

278
00:13:22,939 --> 00:13:24,692
I'll drink it first.

279
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,817
- Not bad, it's really good.
- Mm.

280
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:39,926
Pretty tasty!

281
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,332
I've still got it.

282
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,739
This meat tastes great too.

283
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:54,020
What's wrong?

284
00:13:56,699 --> 00:13:57,939
Nothing.

285
00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:00,934
Just a little stomach discomfort.

286
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:03,980
I'll go to the restroom real quick.

287
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,918
I'll be right back!

288
00:14:18,492 --> 00:14:20,317
What's up? Why are you smiling so much?

289
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:23,027
Your classmate is quite funny.

290
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:24,770
He's always been like this.

291
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,900
Loser.

292
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:28,942
Trying to mess with me?

293
00:14:31,473 --> 00:14:33,856
- Seriously?
- Yeah. Try it. It's really good.

294
00:14:33,979 --> 00:14:35,292
- I want to try it too.
- Mm.

295
00:14:35,352 --> 00:14:36,434
Don't eat too much.

296
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,459
- It's so good.
- Try it.

297
00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:08,192
(White moon)

298
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:09,419
Shi Wen.

299
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:13,260
Shi Wen!

300
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,380
Shi Wen.

301
00:15:27,699 --> 00:15:29,179
I know I'm late.

302
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:30,583
But I...

303
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:35,263
I've always liked you.

304
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:38,325
I hope you can give me a chance.

305
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:42,107
Du Ze...

306
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,260
To me,

307
00:15:45,386 --> 00:15:47,536
you're a very important friend.

308
00:15:48,076 --> 00:15:50,239
I'm really happy you're back.

309
00:15:50,907 --> 00:15:52,322
But I think

310
00:15:52,346 --> 00:15:54,708
we're better suited as friends.

311
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:04,459
There's a leaf.

312
00:16:15,819 --> 00:16:17,188
Am I fooling myself and

313
00:16:17,212 --> 00:16:18,306
others all this time?

314
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:31,500
Thank you.

315
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,659
Du Ze...

316
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,995
I'm sorry.

317
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,200
I believe one day you'll meet someone

318
00:16:38,225 --> 00:16:40,154
who's perfect for you.

319
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:41,981
And who will treat you well.

320
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,096
But I still feel

321
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:45,628
we're better as friends.

322
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:47,980
You're my most important friend.

323
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:50,270
Alright. Then let's hug it out.

324
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,411
Don't fake it!

325
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,747
Still the same as before.

326
00:17:08,139 --> 00:17:09,683
So cute.

327
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:18,580
Shen Nan.

328
00:17:32,499 --> 00:17:33,659
What's wrong?

329
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:37,070
You seem strange today.

330
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,156
Why are you suddenly so cold to me?

331
00:17:40,348 --> 00:17:41,647
It's nothing.

332
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,937
Just feeling a bit tired.

333
00:17:49,257 --> 00:17:50,677
Damn. Leaving already?

334
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,161
We haven't hung out enough.

335
00:17:53,499 --> 00:17:54,499
Who's leaving?

336
00:17:54,499 --> 00:17:55,499
Du Ze.

337
00:17:55,627 --> 00:17:57,577
He came and left in such a hurry.

338
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,687
Why did he leave?

339
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,046
- Didn't Shi Wen already accept him?
- I didn't accept him.

340
00:18:19,939 --> 00:18:20,939
Shi Wen.

341
00:18:25,699 --> 00:18:27,203
When's the finals?

342
00:18:27,259 --> 00:18:29,352
In about two weeks.

343
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,477
Why?

344
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,242
No reason.

345
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:36,915
There's still one month

346
00:18:36,931 --> 00:18:38,110
until your accident.

347
00:18:38,499 --> 00:18:39,899
As long as I make sure nothing

348
00:18:39,907 --> 00:18:41,267
happens that day,

349
00:18:41,499 --> 00:18:43,359
everything should be fine.

350
00:20:20,438 --> 00:20:21,459
Shi Wen.

351
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:24,165
Do you know?

352
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,291
In this lifetime, the number of people

353
00:20:28,316 --> 00:20:29,424
you can protect

354
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:31,650
is very few.

355
00:20:31,979 --> 00:20:34,017
And when they need you,

356
00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:37,470
you just happen to be by their side.

357
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:40,365
The odds of that

358
00:20:40,701 --> 00:20:42,731
are incredibly slim.

359
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:46,462
Such a lucky thing

360
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,876
has already happened to me twice.

361
00:20:59,796 --> 00:21:00,796
Then,

362
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,665
why are you protecting me?

363
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,118
If you want a reason,

364
00:21:12,459 --> 00:21:13,790
it's because of...

365
00:21:19,054 --> 00:21:20,243
What is it?

366
00:21:24,739 --> 00:21:26,216
Regret, I guess.

367
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,263
Like between lovers,

368
00:21:30,459 --> 00:21:32,826
or even friends,

369
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,365
when they meet each other,

370
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,927
but don't cherish one another.

371
00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:42,779
Then later,

372
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,248
it's filled with regret.

373
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,900
Then,

374
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,900
your regret towards me,

375
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,019
is it as a friend

376
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,974
or as a lover?

377
00:22:34,151 --> 00:22:36,429
That ring of yours is pretty unique.

378
00:22:36,499 --> 00:22:37,733
Special, right?

379
00:22:37,821 --> 00:22:40,046
Do you know the story behind this ring?

380
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,780
I don't.

381
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,522
This is called the Eternal Ring.

382
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,155
It's said that a mermaid

383
00:22:46,186 --> 00:22:47,686
and a fisherman fell in love,

384
00:22:47,711 --> 00:22:48,951
but since the mermaid was unable to

385
00:22:48,976 --> 00:22:50,195
recognize the fisherman's face,

386
00:22:50,219 --> 00:22:52,795
so, she gave him this Eternal Ring.

387
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,124
It means that as long as

388
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,412
your lover wears this ring,

389
00:22:55,436 --> 00:22:57,468
they'll always stay by your side.

390
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:01,075
So, where did you buy this ring?

391
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,100
Buy it?

392
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:03,795
You can't buy this kind of thing.

393
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,749
You have to find it in fishing villages.

394
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:07,835
Because it's so special,

395
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,710
most fishermen wouldn't sell it.

396
00:23:12,699 --> 00:23:14,015
Who are you planning to buy it for?

397
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,474
Me? No one.

398
00:23:15,499 --> 00:23:16,900
I'm just asking casually.

399
00:23:19,739 --> 00:23:21,444
Tell me, will you?

400
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,616
Fine, I'll tell you.

401
00:23:44,939 --> 00:23:49,375
But what if he misunderstands?

402
00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:20,419
No.

403
00:24:20,979 --> 00:24:23,075
My sixth sense is always accurate.

404
00:24:23,317 --> 00:24:24,809
It won't lie to me.

405
00:24:48,939 --> 00:24:49,939
Good morning!

406
00:24:49,964 --> 00:24:50,903
Hurry up and wash up!

407
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:51,942
Breakfast is ready.

408
00:25:05,766 --> 00:25:06,780
What's wrong?

409
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,886
Didn't sleep well last night?

410
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,179
Time to eat.

411
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,350
Why are you staring at me? Eat up.

412
00:25:59,459 --> 00:26:01,596
Shi Wen, did you know?

413
00:26:01,862 --> 00:26:03,133
It's said that if you step on

414
00:26:03,158 --> 00:26:04,251
someone's shadow,

415
00:26:04,276 --> 00:26:05,980
they'll stay with you forever.

416
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:07,019
Really?

417
00:26:07,044 --> 00:26:08,096
Really.

418
00:26:08,171 --> 00:26:10,283
Some fool told me that.

419
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:12,069
Oh.

420
00:26:12,093 --> 00:26:15,354
Looks like you and that fool are close.

421
00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:18,791
Yeah, he's a lot like you.

422
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:21,275
How so?

423
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,026
Am I not unique?

424
00:26:23,092 --> 00:26:24,100
You look alike.

425
00:26:24,117 --> 00:26:25,235
Even your voice is similar.

426
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:27,463
Basically, everything is similar.

427
00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:29,916
Then go find him.

428
00:26:33,499 --> 00:26:34,954
I've stepped on your shadow.

429
00:26:34,979 --> 00:26:36,608
I don't want to stay by
your side forever.

430
00:26:36,739 --> 00:26:39,088
I don't want to stay by
your side forever!

431
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,795
I've already stepped on your shadow.

432
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,658
You'll have to stay by my side forever.

433
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,515
I've already stepped on your shadow.

434
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,346
You'll always be by my side now.

435
00:27:00,197 --> 00:27:01,197
Shen Nan.

436
00:27:01,222 --> 00:27:02,222
Hmm?

437
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:03,487
I suddenly find myself

438
00:27:03,512 --> 00:27:05,284
looking forward to winter.

439
00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:08,860
I remember

440
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,002
you didn't like winter much before.

441
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:13,690
That's right.

442
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,444
Because winter never had

443
00:27:16,717 --> 00:27:18,619
what I wanted before.

444
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,744
But now, in this winter,

445
00:27:24,699 --> 00:27:25,820
I have it.

446
00:27:46,795 --> 00:27:47,795
Everyone ready?

447
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,900
- Ready!
- Ready!

448
00:27:48,925 --> 00:27:50,914
Our water gun battle is about to start!

449
00:27:50,939 --> 00:27:53,877
Here we go! Three, two, one, start!

450
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:55,955
You're so annoying!

451
00:28:01,659 --> 00:28:02,659
Shen Nan.

452
00:28:41,722 --> 00:28:44,763
Dear friends, I am back!

453
00:28:44,979 --> 00:28:46,780
Du Ze? Why are you back?

454
00:28:46,805 --> 00:28:48,289
I was playing in the neighboring town
for a few days,

455
00:28:48,305 --> 00:28:49,556
so I came over to hang out with you all!

456
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,595
What were you talking about?

457
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,971
We were discussing what

458
00:28:51,987 --> 00:28:53,395
we want to do in the future.

459
00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:55,394
My brother wants to be a musician.

460
00:28:55,419 --> 00:28:56,604
And Shi Wen?

461
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,272
Shi Wen doesn't even need to say it.

462
00:28:58,296 --> 00:28:59,580
He's going to be a big artist

463
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:00,800
in the future, right?

464
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:02,483
Let's give an early toast

465
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:03,955
to Shi Wen's success, shall we?

466
00:29:03,979 --> 00:29:05,355
- Come. - Cheers!
- Thanks.

467
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,628
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

468
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:08,362
Cheers!

469
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,954
What about you, Shen Nan?

470
00:29:13,979 --> 00:29:15,460
What are your plans for the future?

471
00:29:15,499 --> 00:29:16,820
Are you planning to stay here?

472
00:29:16,884 --> 00:29:18,054
Me?

473
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,366
I'm actually a dentist.

474
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:22,559
But recently, I received a

475
00:29:22,567 --> 00:29:23,642
notice from the hospital.

476
00:29:23,676 --> 00:29:25,762
Because I reported some

477
00:29:25,771 --> 00:29:27,661
illegal activities earlier,

478
00:29:27,979 --> 00:29:30,288
they're asking me to return to work.

479
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,200
But I've postponed my return

480
00:29:32,224 --> 00:29:33,224
for a month.

481
00:29:33,499 --> 00:29:35,390
Because I want to enjoy

482
00:29:36,491 --> 00:29:38,163
this carefree time here

483
00:29:38,851 --> 00:29:40,595
for a little longer.

484
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,601
Wow, you're amazing, Shen Nan!

485
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,364
I believe good things will come

486
00:29:44,389 --> 00:29:46,169
your way for doing good deeds!

487
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:48,981
So, does that mean we'll have a

488
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:51,464
connection in the city in the future?

489
00:29:51,867 --> 00:29:53,867
- Yeah, our city connection!
- Wow.

490
00:29:53,979 --> 00:29:55,620
- Connection brother!
- Connection brother!

491
00:29:55,699 --> 00:29:57,355
Alright, stop teasing me!

492
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,714
Let's have another toast.

493
00:29:58,739 --> 00:30:00,145
To celebrate Shen Nan's successful

494
00:30:00,153 --> 00:30:01,301
return to work, okay?

495
00:30:01,325 --> 00:30:02,785
- Okay!
- Thank you all.

496
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:04,027
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

497
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,245
Congratulations!

498
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,439
Why don't we play a game?

499
00:30:29,464 --> 00:30:31,377
Sure. What should we play?

500
00:30:31,419 --> 00:30:32,474
Truth or dare!

501
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:33,692
- Alright.
- Sounds good.

502
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,580
- Then we...
- Let's clean up first.

503
00:30:35,596 --> 00:30:36,596
- Okay.
- Okay, come.

504
00:30:36,621 --> 00:30:37,755
- I'll spin first, okay?
- Sure.

505
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,877
- Alright.
- Go ahead, spin!

506
00:30:41,658 --> 00:30:42,715
- Oh!
- Oh!

507
00:30:42,739 --> 00:30:43,820
Du Ze!

508
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:45,494
You're really good at spinning.

509
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,088
- Let me ask, let me ask!
- Mm.

510
00:30:47,459 --> 00:30:49,080
Truth or dare?

511
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:51,830
Truth.

512
00:30:53,314 --> 00:30:56,884
Is there someone you like here?

513
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,620
Yes.

514
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:02,799
Two people.

515
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:04,298
- What?
- Huh?

516
00:31:05,219 --> 00:31:07,459
- Who are they?
- Who?

517
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:08,728
Do you want to know?

518
00:31:08,939 --> 00:31:10,213
Come.

519
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,377
That's a second question.

520
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:13,994
Boring.

521
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:15,205
Alright, my turn.

522
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:20,155
- Huh...
- Huh...

523
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:21,355
- Shi Wen!
- Shi Wen!

524
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,474
Truth or dare?

525
00:31:23,499 --> 00:31:24,797
Truth.

526
00:31:24,822 --> 00:31:26,103
We've already played truth.

527
00:31:26,127 --> 00:31:27,155
Pick dare this time.

528
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:29,492
- Fine.
- I'll ask the question.

529
00:31:32,219 --> 00:31:34,634
Kiss Shen Nan or me, pick one.

530
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,187
- What?
- Huh?

531
00:31:43,397 --> 00:31:44,666
Since it's a punishment,

532
00:31:44,675 --> 00:31:46,115
you have to do it.

533
00:31:46,812 --> 00:31:48,968
- You two, kiss!
- Come on, kiss!

534
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,835
Come on, kiss!

535
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:59,300
Kiss!

536
00:32:09,862 --> 00:32:11,076
Hello.

537
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,259
Alright, alright, I'm on my way.

538
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,115
Sorry, something urgent came up.

539
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,572
I need to go now.

540
00:32:19,179 --> 00:32:20,354
See you next time.

541
00:32:20,893 --> 00:32:23,100
Lame.

542
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,580
This big brother...

543
00:32:24,697 --> 00:32:26,229
Should've just picked me.

544
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,939
Right? He left, didn't he?

545
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,150
Let's keep playing.

546
00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:15,939
Why are you back so late?

547
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,257
You're awake?

548
00:33:17,699 --> 00:33:18,685
Sorry about that,

549
00:33:18,716 --> 00:33:19,995
I had something urgent.

550
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:22,148
Why didn't you go to bed?

551
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,929
I was worried about you.

552
00:33:30,699 --> 00:33:32,075
Shen Nan, I think...

553
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,499
Don't say anything.

554
00:33:35,209 --> 00:33:37,540
Let me recharge here for a bit.

555
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:45,936
Are you leaving?

556
00:33:48,019 --> 00:33:50,038
I'm going to work,

557
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,382
not leaving for good.

558
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,468
I won't leave you.

559
00:33:59,259 --> 00:34:01,178
For your competition,

560
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,079
I postponed my return

561
00:34:03,087 --> 00:34:04,607
to work by a month.

562
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:06,699
Don't worry.

563
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,397
I'll always be with you.

564
00:34:18,946 --> 00:34:20,187
What's wrong?

565
00:34:53,347 --> 00:34:54,735
I'm going to win first place

566
00:34:54,766 --> 00:34:55,995
in the art competition.

567
00:34:56,019 --> 00:34:59,771
Maybe then I can work in your city.

568
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:18,296
This painting is incredible.

569
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,675
When the competition is over,

570
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,374
I have something to tell you.

571
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,380
Oh, really?

572
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,300
What is it?

573
00:35:34,749 --> 00:35:36,780
I'll tell you when it's over.

574
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,732
(No loving each other)

575
00:36:20,139 --> 00:36:21,880
Is this a sign?

576
00:36:29,059 --> 00:36:30,380
I don't care.

577
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,982
Nothing will stop me.

578
00:36:41,642 --> 00:36:45,501
(Notification of employment letter)

579
00:36:55,629 --> 00:36:57,113
Don't miss the announcement

580
00:36:57,121 --> 00:36:58,847
of Shi Wen's competition results.

581
00:37:14,472 --> 00:37:15,950
Hello, Shen Nan!

582
00:37:16,023 --> 00:37:17,195
I won!

583
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,238
I won first place in

584
00:37:18,254 --> 00:37:19,378
the art competition!

585
00:37:20,215 --> 00:37:21,235
Thank you.

586
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,606
I couldn't have done it without you.

587
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,067
Congratulations, Shi Wen!

588
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:26,315
That's amazing!

589
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,074
I always believed you could do it.

590
00:37:28,099 --> 00:37:29,994
Wait for me. I'll come over to
see you right now.

591
00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:31,496
Let's celebrate!

592
00:37:31,864 --> 00:37:33,195
I'm coming to see you.

593
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,394
I have something to tell you.

594
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,394
Don't move. Stay where you are
and wait for me.

595
00:37:36,419 --> 00:37:38,074
Wait for me. I'm coming to see you.

596
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:39,536
You mustn't...

597
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,700
Shi Wen!

598
00:37:41,732 --> 00:37:42,732
Hello.

599
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,095
Driver, hurry up!

600
00:37:55,579 --> 00:37:56,860
Shi Wen!

601
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,300
Shi Wen!

602
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,820
Shi Wen!

603
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,579
Shi Wen!

604
00:38:33,822 --> 00:38:34,822
Be careful!

605
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,284
Stay right there and don't move!

606
00:38:36,308 --> 00:38:37,089
Wait for me!

607
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,183
What's wrong?

608
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:29,133
The thing I was worried about

609
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,104
is finally over.

610
00:39:32,499 --> 00:39:33,957
What thing?

611
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,300
Oh, right.

612
00:39:37,499 --> 00:39:39,043
What did you want to tell me?

613
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,459
Shen Nan,

614
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,905
I like you.

615
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,059
Do you

616
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,085
want to date me?

617
00:40:53,848 --> 00:40:55,848
(Next episode)

618
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,480
Will you come with me?

619
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,780
Sure.
