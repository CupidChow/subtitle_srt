"I Will Turn Back This Time"

2
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,800
(Episode 5)

3
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,719
Why?

4
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,159
In this world we live in now,

5
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:16,163
changes in time and space dimensions

6
00:01:16,178 --> 00:01:17,978
consume tremendous energy.

7
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,914
Your encounter

8
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,844
is destined by fate.

9
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:26,024
As long as you love each other,

10
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,415
he will die for some reason.

11
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,735
Shi Wen, don't move!

12
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,080
This is a curse you cannot escape.

13
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,457
The falling paintings,

14
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:01,269
and the strange occurrences,

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,801
they are warnings to you.

16
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,785
If you love him,

17
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:11,965
then please place that love

18
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,277
where he cannot see it.

19
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,399
Why?

20
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,480
Why?

21
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:28,334
Why let us meet but not

22
00:02:28,342 --> 00:02:29,856
allow us to be together?

23
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,355
Why are you tormenting me like this?

24
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,999
Why?

25
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,700
(Episode 5: Love and Death, You and Me)

26
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:02,679
Shen Nan.

27
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:04,239
What's wrong?

28
00:03:04,264 --> 00:03:05,832
What happened, Shen Nan?

29
00:03:13,312 --> 00:03:14,431
Shi Wen.

30
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:16,200
I'm here.

31
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,980
Shi Wen, promise me.

32
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,566
You absolutely cannot die.

33
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:27,159
No matter what, you must live well.

34
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,140
What are you talking about?

35
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:31,108
I'm perfectly fine and alive, aren't I?

36
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,679
Shi Wen, promise me.

37
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,239
No matter what happens,

38
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:38,012
no matter what difficulties

39
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,616
and pressures we face,

40
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,792
you must live strong.

41
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:44,355
Shen Nan, don't worry.

42
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:46,589
No matter what happens,

43
00:03:46,632 --> 00:03:48,378
I'll keep living well.

44
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:51,160
Mom has already agreed
to us being together.

45
00:03:51,185 --> 00:03:52,566
From now on,

46
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,308
we won't be separated.

47
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,720
Shen Nan.

48
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,520
Shen Nan.

49
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,319
Shen Nan.

50
00:04:58,559 --> 00:04:59,800
Wake up, Shen Nan.

51
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,040
Shen Nan.

52
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:07,999
Shen Nan.

53
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,439
Shen Nan.

54
00:05:16,679 --> 00:05:17,679
Strange.

55
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:20,301
Where did he go so early in the morning?

56
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,738
Last night, we talked so well.

57
00:05:24,763 --> 00:05:26,496
He didn't mention leaving.

58
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,400
Shen Nan!

59
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:00,160
Shen Nan!

60
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,439
Shen Nan!

61
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:05,600
Shen Nan!

62
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,040
Shen Nan!

63
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,199
Shen Nan!

64
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:15,559
Shen Nan!

65
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,960
Shen Nan!

66
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,520
Shen Nan!

67
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,199
Shen Nan, where are you?

68
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:28,999
Shi Wen.

69
00:06:30,152 --> 00:06:31,512
Let's break up.

70
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,800
Shen Nan!

71
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720
Jiang Yilin!

72
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,079
Jiang Yilin!

73
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,985
Get me more booze, Jiang Yilin!

74
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:05,165
Shi Wen, stop drinking, Shi Wen!

75
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,712
What's wrong with you?

76
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,895
Leave me alone.

77
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,282
Shi Wen, Shi Wen, stop drinking!

78
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,946
- Leave me alone.
- Stop drinking!

79
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:21,679
You...

80
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,559
Did you have a fight with Shen Nan?

81
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,119
Are you okay, Shi Wen?

82
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:26,551
Shi Wen.

83
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,695
If something's wrong, tell us.

84
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,071
Drinking alone won't help.

85
00:08:31,088 --> 00:08:32,376
We can work it out together.

86
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,514
Just tell us, what's going on?

87
00:08:35,232 --> 00:08:36,951
Shi Wen, Shi Wen!

88
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,030
- Shi Wen!
- Shi Wen!

89
00:08:38,077 --> 00:08:39,135
Shi Wen!

90
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,159
- Shi Wen!
- Shi Wen!

91
00:08:40,199 --> 00:08:41,679
- Shi Wen!
- Shi Wen! Brother, what now?

92
00:08:41,704 --> 00:08:42,913
Call an ambulance!

93
00:08:53,912 --> 00:08:56,221
Doctor, how is my friend?

94
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,015
Preliminary checks,

95
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,460
It seems he drank excessively,

96
00:08:59,477 --> 00:09:00,695
causing gastric bleeding.

97
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:03,089
We've started IV treatment.

98
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,050
He needs rest now.

99
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:06,722
Take good care of him.

100
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:09,599
Thank you, doctor.

101
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,878
Thank you, doctor.

102
00:09:13,796 --> 00:09:15,167
Dammit.

103
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,855
Shen Nan has gone too far!

104
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,179
Brother, this is a hospital.

105
00:09:18,203 --> 00:09:19,243
Keep it down.

106
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:21,026
Don't disturb other patients.

107
00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:22,962
Besides, the priority is to

108
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:24,455
take care of Shi Wen.

109
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,654
Help him recover quickly.

110
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,294
Not to make a scene here.

111
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:29,487
You're just making things worse.

112
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,729
I understand.

113
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,659
But we can't let this go.

114
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,745
We need answers.

115
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,555
Call him now.

116
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,891
Bring him here to settle this!

117
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:03,679
Shi Wen.

118
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:06,120
Shi Wen...

119
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:10,479
I warned you already, right?

120
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,000
Don't hurt Shi Wen!

121
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,280
Look at him now, it's all your fault!

122
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:16,578
- Brother, calm down!
- You're right.

123
00:10:17,719 --> 00:10:19,164
It's all my fault.

124
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,880
I'm at fault.

125
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,600
I don't have the ability

126
00:10:22,632 --> 00:10:23,376
to take care of him.

127
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,679
Shen Nan.

128
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,520
Shi Wen.

129
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,000
Shi Wen.

130
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:35,920
Brother. Let them talk alone.

131
00:10:35,945 --> 00:10:37,355
Let's go.

132
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,160
Shen Nan.

133
00:10:39,455 --> 00:10:41,105
One last warning,

134
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,280
if you hurt Shi Wen again,

135
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,074
I won't let you off!

136
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:54,880
Shi Wen.

137
00:10:55,439 --> 00:10:57,129
In your current state,

138
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:00,160
do I need to tell Auntie?

139
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
No.

140
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,479
I'm fine.

141
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,120
I don't want them to worry.

142
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,040
Alright.

143
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,640
I'll listen to you.

144
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,160
Don't leave.

145
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,403
I'll go buy you some daily necessities.

146
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,582
Anything else you need?

147
00:11:28,392 --> 00:11:29,872
I'm hungry.

148
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Alright.

149
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,599
I'll make you some soup.

150
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,697
I want to stay away from Shi Wen,

151
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,520
to stop disturbing his life.

152
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:56,447
But seeing him sick like this,

153
00:11:57,199 --> 00:11:58,979
I feel heartbroken on one hand,

154
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,800
but on the other hand,

155
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:02,350
I can't bring myself

156
00:12:02,366 --> 00:12:03,826
to leave completely.

157
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:06,880
What should I do?

158
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,832
No, I need to get Chen Ji

159
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,200
Wenchang chicken.

160
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,697
No, it has to be Spanish ham.

161
00:12:23,438 --> 00:12:25,279
This pork knuckle should be fine, right?

162
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:27,095
Put all three together,

163
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,815
simmer them on low heat for two hours.

164
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:29,841
Okay.

165
00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:22,679
You're awake.

166
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,086
Do you feel better?

167
00:13:29,311 --> 00:13:31,117
Any discomfort anywhere?

168
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:35,015
When did you come?

169
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,839
Get up and have some soup.

170
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,959
Careful, careful.

171
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,299
Come on.

172
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:07,694
I'll help you up.

173
00:14:07,719 --> 00:14:09,104
I'll feed you.

174
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,479
Is it good?

175
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:34,599
It's delicious.

176
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,666
Thanks to Yilin for helping out.

177
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,924
Sign here, and you can be discharged.

178
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,707
I heard there's an empty spot in Room 3.

179
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,240
Yes.

180
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,280
Let me tell you,

181
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,019
when I did rounds earlier,

182
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,207
- Mm.
- I saw two men hugging.

183
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:48,176
Who?

184
00:16:48,489 --> 00:16:50,375
That patient with the surname Gu.

185
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,856
He's already recovered but

186
00:16:51,872 --> 00:16:53,616
still came to talk with me,

187
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,192
asking to stay a few more days

188
00:16:55,217 --> 00:16:56,270
in the hospital.

189
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:57,910
I can't approve that.

190
00:16:57,935 --> 00:16:59,215
The hospital has strict policies.

191
00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:01,081
Beds can't be occupied unnecessarily.

192
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,200
Especially with so many people waiting.

193
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Hello.

194
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,723
Were you talking about Mr. Gu

195
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:11,840
in Room 3 just now?

196
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,680
Yes.

197
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,960
So he's already fine

198
00:17:15,985 --> 00:17:17,334
and can be discharged, right?

199
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,359
Yes.

200
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,520
Gu Shi Wen.

201
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,159
Stop pretending.

202
00:17:48,113 --> 00:17:49,970
Your body's already recovered, yes?

203
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,200
I…

204
00:17:55,225 --> 00:17:56,251
What? You're fine.

205
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:58,196
Why are you still staying here?

206
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,290
I had no choice.

207
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,962
Because only this way,

208
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,939
you would stay by my side.

209
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,814
Besides,

210
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,767
you care about me, don't you?

211
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:10,814
If you truly didn't like me,

212
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,093
when you heard I was sick,

213
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,867
why would you take care of me?

214
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,520
Gu Shi Wen.

215
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,000
You need to understand.

216
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:27,440
Our relationship

217
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,800
is already over.

218
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:35,960
But...

219
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,200
We are family.

220
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:44,802
Of course, I should take care

221
00:18:44,818 --> 00:18:45,958
of you if you're sick.

222
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,240
So I hope you can understand.

223
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,399
Our relationship...

224
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,624
is not love.

225
00:19:54,036 --> 00:19:56,747
(Global Medical Innovation
And Practice Medical) (Invitation)

226
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:00,079
Professor,

227
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,196
thank you for helping me apply for

228
00:20:02,212 --> 00:20:04,274
the overseas medical exchange program.

229
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,680
I've decided to go.

230
00:20:13,107 --> 00:20:20,021
(Mom)

231
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,359
Son, are you okay?

232
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm very worried about you.

233
00:20:37,848 --> 00:20:39,257
I'm fine, Mom,

234
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,350
just a little tired.

235
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,219
I've thought a lot

236
00:20:43,235 --> 00:20:44,335
during this time, too.

237
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:45,935
No matter what decision you make,

238
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,053
Mom will always support you.

239
00:20:50,475 --> 00:20:52,680
I understand.

240
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:58,239
Hello.

241
00:20:58,599 --> 00:20:59,599
Shen Nan.

242
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:02,434
Shi Wen.

243
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,911
I've decided to go abroad.

244
00:21:07,129 --> 00:21:08,833
Can we meet?

245
00:21:09,961 --> 00:21:11,614
I'll send you the location.

246
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:00,079
Shi Wen...

247
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:23,873
Don't leave me, okay?

248
00:22:26,449 --> 00:22:27,568
Don't cry.

249
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,510
I don't want to see you cry

250
00:22:31,526 --> 00:22:32,646
because of me.

251
00:22:37,921 --> 00:22:39,334
Forget me.

252
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:43,079
No.

253
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,720
No.

254
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:47,919
No.

255
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,800
Let go.

256
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:54,079
No.

257
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,359
No.

258
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,559
Let go.

259
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,075
I beg you, Shen Nan, don't leave me.

260
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:21,497
Don't go, okay?

261
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:51,156
Shen Nan!

262
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:01,752
(Two weeks later)

263
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:14,632
(Shi Wen)

264
00:25:21,671 --> 00:25:23,599
Hello, Shen Nan.

265
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,590
Do you remember the painting competition

266
00:25:26,615 --> 00:25:28,295
you signed me up for?

267
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:30,436
I won an award.

268
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,178
Congratulations, Shi Wen.

269
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:40,319
That's amazing.

270
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,070
You were the one who registered me

271
00:25:44,095 --> 00:25:45,241
for the competition,

272
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,202
and the one who encouraged me to join.

273
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,945
Even the theme of the painting

274
00:25:48,953 --> 00:25:50,073
was your idea.

275
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:53,680
I wanted to share this joy with you.

276
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,200
Can you come to my award ceremony?

277
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,960
Shi Wen.

278
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,480
I really want to come.

279
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:12,619
But I have to catch my flight.

280
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,639
Shen Nan.

281
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,673
I understand your decision.

282
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,407
I've already sent you the invitation.

283
00:26:21,728 --> 00:26:23,493
I still hope you can make it.

284
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:44,894
After all these years,

285
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:46,480
(Jiang Enya)
it's been so long since I've seen

286
00:26:46,512 --> 00:26:47,682
Shi Wen this happy.

287
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,806
He's changed so much because of you.

288
00:26:50,181 --> 00:26:51,879
If you truly love him,

289
00:26:51,904 --> 00:26:54,204
please protect him as we do.

290
00:27:12,136 --> 00:27:13,800
This is a little kid.

291
00:27:15,495 --> 00:27:17,308
- These are people all around?
- Mm.

292
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,628
This little girl.

293
00:27:20,449 --> 00:27:21,831
This is a puppy.

294
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,316
And this is a kitten.

295
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:24,691
What about this in the middle?

296
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,599
It's a bonfire.

297
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:28,440
A bonfire party, right?

298
00:27:28,465 --> 00:27:29,667
Yes.

299
00:27:31,238 --> 00:27:33,055
Exactly! Not bad.

300
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,399
Jiang Yilin!

301
00:27:35,378 --> 00:27:36,503
Duze!

302
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,159
Hello!

303
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,152
Such a lively day today!

304
00:27:40,879 --> 00:27:42,534
On such an important day for Shi Wen,

305
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,370
why isn't Shen Nan here?

306
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:46,160
They...

307
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,520
broke up.

308
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:49,839
What?

309
00:27:50,527 --> 00:27:51,550
When?

310
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,902
Brother, stop talking.

311
00:27:52,927 --> 00:27:54,480
It's not the right time.

312
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,097
Looks like I've got a chance.

313
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:08,399
Shen Nan!

314
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,038
You've got no chance.

315
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,764
Well, you never know.

316
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:25,639
Shen Nan.

317
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:29,720
Thank you for coming.

318
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,440
Shi Wen.

319
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:35,785
Your persistence made me realize

320
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,559
that as long as I'm with you,

321
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:40,800
even if it's for one day,

322
00:29:41,639 --> 00:29:43,000
one hour,

323
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,559
or one second,

324
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:49,404
it will be the most precious moment

325
00:29:49,429 --> 00:29:50,429
of my life.

326
00:30:22,657 --> 00:30:25,571
(Award ceremony)

327
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:29,054
Creativity knows no bounds,
transcending borders.

328
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,287
Now let's welcome the champion

329
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:31,295
of this competition,

330
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:34,415
Mr. Gu Shi Wen, with a round of applause!

331
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:43,889
Next, we invite the award presenter

332
00:30:43,905 --> 00:30:45,496
to present the award to Mr. Gu Shi Wen.

333
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,613
Applause!

334
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:53,415
Congratulations again to Mr. Gu Shi Wen

335
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,889
for winning the championship in

336
00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:56,375
his first-ever painting competition.

337
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,014
Now, let's invite him to give

338
00:30:58,038 --> 00:30:59,233
his acceptance speech.

339
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:07,605
First of all, thank you to the judges

340
00:31:07,629 --> 00:31:09,149
for recognizing me.

341
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,159
Secondly,

342
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,520
I want to thank someone even more.

343
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,449
It's because of them

344
00:31:17,328 --> 00:31:18,564
that I found the inspiration

345
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,575
for this painting.

346
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:21,275
They taught me that every

347
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,980
little moment in life

348
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,113
is worth cherishing,

349
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,152
whether in success or in failure.

350
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:32,171
As long as we bravely pursue and try,

351
00:31:32,647 --> 00:31:34,296
then the process itself,

352
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,960
gives life its meaning.

353
00:32:13,356 --> 00:32:17,543
(Award ceremony)

354
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:42,159
Enya,

355
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,639
call 120.

356
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,935
I'll look for a doctor here.

357
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,599
Hurry, go quickly!

358
00:32:57,399 --> 00:32:58,680
Shi Wen.

359
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,879
It's okay.

360
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,520
It's okay, Shi Wen.

361
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,720
Let's go.

362
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,215
We'll go to the hospital.

363
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,960
You must hold on!

364
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,217
Shen... Shen Nan...

365
00:33:15,115 --> 00:33:16,490
There's no way

366
00:33:16,811 --> 00:33:18,530
we can be together

367
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,584
now, right?

368
00:33:23,967 --> 00:33:25,250
No,

369
00:33:26,355 --> 00:33:27,412
no,

370
00:33:27,803 --> 00:33:30,154
we will always be together.

371
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:32,970
No one can stop us.

372
00:33:34,035 --> 00:33:35,155
Perhaps

373
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,530
this is

374
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:42,530
the arrangement of fate.

375
00:33:44,011 --> 00:33:46,050
We can never

376
00:33:46,402 --> 00:33:48,539
be together.

377
00:33:58,211 --> 00:33:59,973
Okay.

378
00:34:00,188 --> 00:34:02,290
Okay.

379
00:34:07,566 --> 00:34:09,165
I'm sorry.

380
00:34:09,404 --> 00:34:11,083
It's all my fault.

381
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:14,349
It's all my fault.

382
00:34:44,887 --> 00:34:46,592
It's all my fault.

383
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:49,522
It's all my fault.

384
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:55,250
Why?

385
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,250
Why?

386
00:34:58,546 --> 00:35:00,986
Why wasn't it me who died?

387
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,145
Why?

388
00:35:06,348 --> 00:35:08,887
Why wasn't it me who died?

389
00:35:23,509 --> 00:35:24,827
Give me another chance.

390
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,234
As long as Shi Wen can come back to life,

391
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,616
I'll do anything you ask.

392
00:35:29,811 --> 00:35:31,186
Give me another chance.

393
00:35:31,211 --> 00:35:33,944
Warning. The electronic energy necklace

394
00:35:34,051 --> 00:35:35,984
can only be used once.

395
00:35:39,285 --> 00:35:40,335
What chance?

396
00:35:40,378 --> 00:35:41,569
Tell me.

397
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,059
Tell me.

398
00:35:43,257 --> 00:35:44,891
Tell me what chance.

399
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:46,793
As long as Shi Wen can come back to life,

400
00:35:46,818 --> 00:35:48,145
I'll agree to anything.

401
00:35:48,451 --> 00:35:51,412
I'm begging you to take me back!

402
00:35:51,477 --> 00:35:53,562
Take me back!

403
00:35:55,837 --> 00:35:57,277
Please.

404
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:15,885
Shi Wen.

405
00:36:16,748 --> 00:36:17,868
Shi Wen.

406
00:36:23,867 --> 00:36:25,813
We can go back now, Shi Wen.

407
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,020
This time,

408
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:41,100
I'll definitely control myself.

409
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,363
(Next Episode)
Wait.

410
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,152
Have we met somewhere before?

411
00:37:48,114 --> 00:37:49,395
I don't think so.

412
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,320
Stay for a coffee before you go.

413
00:37:52,649 --> 00:37:53,649
It's on me.

414
00:37:53,885 --> 00:37:55,782
Let's call it fate bringing us together twice.

415
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,463
Shen Nan.

416
00:37:57,568 --> 00:37:58,877
You're here too?

417
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,034
In a small town in the south,

418
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:16,105
there lives a retired

419
00:38:16,113 --> 00:38:17,476
old Chinese medicine doctor.

420
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,886
Her name is Grandma Yu.

421
00:38:20,139 --> 00:38:21,534
She once cured many rare

422
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:22,792
and difficult illnesses.

423
00:38:28,179 --> 00:38:29,179
Hello,

424
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,048
are you Grandma Yu?

425
00:38:34,293 --> 00:38:35,293
Leave.

426
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,025
I no longer practice medicine.

427
00:38:40,739 --> 00:38:41,823
It's all because you

428
00:38:41,831 --> 00:38:43,436
didn't tell the truth.

429
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:46,019
You said your illness was insomnia.

430
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,460
But actually,

431
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:48,955
it wasn't at all.
