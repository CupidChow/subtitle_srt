1
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,626
I'd like to make a toast to all of you.
I'm so happy that I can attend your party.

2
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:14,901
Don't be so pumped up.

3
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:20,440
We just had a bet on who can get
his chick here with a call.

4
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:23,844
I didn't know you're so obedient to me.

5
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,947
Really? It is my honor.

6
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,119
Since you're so obedient,

7
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,321
and you showed me great respect
in front of my buddies,

8
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,990
I think I should give you a present.

9
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:49,703
Everyone,

10
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:53,740
this is my extremely obedient,
with same social status,

11
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,542
girlfriend number 101.

12
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:59,613
I gave you that kiss
for the sake of my friends.

13
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,282
You should thank them for that.

14
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,216
I can't drink much.

15
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,885
That's it for me after this one glass.

16
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,888
I think I won't bother you any longer.

17
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,891
If we can meet again,
I'm sure that we'll have a good time.

18
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:45,859
Goodbye.

19
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:57,104
Meizuo. Show her out.

20
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,644
Let's go.

21
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:08,348
Hey.

22
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,351
Don't you think Meizuo
went a bit too far this time?

23
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,654
I think that Ying Xiaociao
is a decent person.

24
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,156
Why does Meizuo dislike her?

25
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:17,924
Really?

26
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:22,429
I think Meizuo has fallen in love
with her.

27
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:47,120
That slap was for disrespecting me
even after I've shown you respect.

28
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:53,994
The time of our date tomorrow is 2:00 p.m.

29
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,996
Please remember to pick me up on time.

30
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:26,193
<i>MEMORY: FROM MIND TO MOLECULES</i>

31
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,517
What book did you buy?

32
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,452
This is the best one.

33
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:56,790
You see, this album has photos
of major cities around the world.

34
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:00,293
I'll read it page by page before I sleep.

35
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,030
Maybe I'll dream of traveling
to these places after I fall asleep.

36
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,066
-Sounds amazing.
-Yeah.

37
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,272
I heard that it is sinking.

38
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,407
So I have to visit it as soon as possible.

39
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:15,475
Really?

40
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:20,614
I think I must be a dolphin
in my past life.

41
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,918
I swam from the Pacific Ocean
to the Atlantic Ocean.

42
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,786
From the North Sea to the South Sea.

43
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,122
I lived in the ocean all my life.

44
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:33,326
But I wondered what was it like on land.

45
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:38,765
Finally, I fell into depression.

46
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,934
And I died in sorrow.

47
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:46,506
So I reincarnated as a smart person
in this life.

48
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,377
I tried my best to learn languages
and paint.

49
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,281
To make up for my past life,

50
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,549
I will travel around the world.

51
00:06:57,117 --> 00:07:00,720
I'll see everything on land,
and paint them.

52
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,523
You have a very good imagination.

53
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,526
That's why I love traveling so much.

54
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,628
I've loved it since childhood.

55
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:12,465
I feel I'm going to suffocate
if I stay at one place for too long.

56
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,604
Sagrada Família.

57
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:19,839
Barcelona.

58
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:23,510
It's so beautiful.

59
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,547
Last time I went there,
I had no time to take many photos.

60
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,416
I didn't even get to buy souvenirs.

61
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:31,685
I'll definitely visit there again
if I have the chance.

62
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,022
Right, I forgot to ask you.

63
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:39,993
We found a ring when Ah Xing
and I was caught in the car accident.

64
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,328
There is a meteor design on it.

65
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:42,796
Was it yours?

66
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,731
You found that ring?

67
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,068
But unfortunately,
not soon after we went to Taiwan,

68
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,402
a thief stole it from us.

69
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:51,905
That's okay.

70
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,640
That ring is cursed.

71
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,876
But was that ring really yours?

72
00:07:57,344 --> 00:08:00,213
Or Ah Xing planned to give it to you?

73
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:03,383
Let's change the topic.

74
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,784
It doesn't matter anymore.

75
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,886
Come on, tell me, Shancai.

76
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,460
Daoming Si told me to meet him
at the church at that time.

77
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,062
He bought that ring himself in advance.

78
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:18,531
Then,

79
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,667
we're here now.

80
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:22,068
You know the rest.

81
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:32,746
Don't worry.

82
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,448
Ah Xing's memory is coming back slowly.

83
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:40,086
He'll remember everything
that happened before Barcelona.

84
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,722
You two can go back
to how you were before.

85
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:45,558
And I don't have to travel
through books anymore.

86
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,660
Everything will turn out fine.

87
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:48,995
Yesha.

88
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,132
What if after Daoming Si restores
his memory,

89
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,500
he's still in love with you?

90
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,070
Silly, that's impossible.

91
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,408
Daoming Si used to call me silly a lot.

92
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:07,047
You must really want
to hear him call you silly one more time.

93
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,629
Silly, answer the phone.

94
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,464
If you're a silly.

95
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:27,834
This won't do.
You have to say it more seriously.

96
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,869
Like you're both mad and sorry
at the same time.

97
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:30,870
Let's do it again.

98
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,506
I can't do it anymore.

99
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,108
Yes you can.

100
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,076
Come on.

101
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,110
I...

102
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,881
The last one is pretty good.
Why do you want to use this one?

103
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,216
Let's just record it, okay?

104
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:45,852
Oh, you...

105
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,786
Here.

106
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:52,992
Silly, answer the phone!

107
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:56,696
Thanks.

108
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,699
Hey. You haven't told me why...

109
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:04,404
-Morning, sir.
-Morning.

110
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:06,072
Manger, you've recovered.

111
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:06,973
-Congratulations.
-Yeah.

112
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,274
I'm much better now. Thanks.

113
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,012
-Morning, sir. You're back.
-Morning.

114
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:14,714
-Morning, sir.
-Morning.

115
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,023
Hey, Manager.

116
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:25,258
Morning.

117
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:29,462
Manager, didn't the President tell you
to rest for a few more days?

118
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,198
If I keep resting,
I'll have mold growing on me.

119
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:34,701
Yes, my dad told me to lie in bed at home.

120
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,436
But it's more tiring for me to lie in bed.

121
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,972
How about that?
Are you ready for overtime?

122
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,274
Yes, sir. I'm ready for overtime anytime.

123
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:42,942
The first thing we'll do is...

124
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,477
Make you a cup of espresso.

125
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:45,778
-Thank you.
-No problem.

126
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,389
Secretary Xu, this file is...

127
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:57,390
You little brat.

128
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,927
Didn't I tell you
that you don't have to work so early?

129
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,330
Dad, I'm fine now.

130
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,633
I can't stand staying at home,
away from my office.

131
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:09,269
Fine.

132
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:11,404
But you take care of yourself.

133
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,072
-Don't get too tired.
-Manager.

134
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:16,876
President.

135
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,978
Sir, your espresso.

136
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:19,913
Thanks.

137
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,414
Secretary Xu.

138
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:22,448
Yes, President.

139
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:26,085
Don't let him drink things
that can hurt his stomach like this.

140
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,554
Okay, sir.

141
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,535
How about it? Not bad, right?

142
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:47,607
Do you need any additional information?

143
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:57,917
Mimi.

144
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,153
Stop crying.

145
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,056
People might think
that I've done something to you.

146
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,228
The love story of Yingde University.

147
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:11,397
The story of Shancai and Daoming Si.

148
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:16,302
Thanks to you,
I know everything about it now.

149
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:17,670
Really?

150
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,606
It took me all day and night.

151
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:24,310
I was thinking of
what happened before really hard.

152
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,579
And the result is this note.

153
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,448
It's all a bit messy though.

154
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,016
Can you understand it?

155
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:30,984
Of course.

156
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,186
And I'm so moved by it.

157
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,656
All I have to do is take this note
to Daoming Si.

158
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,392
It will help bring back his memory, right?

159
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,495
Yes, of course. That's for sure.

160
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:45,498
Qinghe.

161
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:49,736
I have a very private question.
Is it okay if ask you?

162
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:53,873
Did your dad tell you something again?

163
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,074
Oh, no.

164
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:58,077
I mean, Qinghe,

165
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:02,715
if one day, something happens to me,

166
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:06,953
will you also take good care of me
like what you're doing to Shancai?

167
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,294
No.

168
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:30,710
That's because
we're not that close enough.

169
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:35,782
When one day,
we're as close as Shancai and me,

170
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,384
I'll do all I can to protect you.

171
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,988
I'm so relieved to hear that from you.

172
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:43,656
I'll keep doing my best.

173
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,725
Of course. You should do your best.

174
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:48,461
But first, we should do our best
for Shancai's happiness.

175
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,801
CALL CONTACT
DAOMING SI

176
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:22,662
Thanks.

177
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,997
I'm sorry, sir. I'll go out for lunch.

178
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,100
Do you want me
to bring your lunch for you?

179
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:28,968
What?

It's midday already?

181
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,309
No, it's okay.
I have an appointment. Thanks.

Miss, this is a round-trip parcel.

<i>So, hurry up and let the delivery man

00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,115
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

191
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,389
Hey, workaholic. It's time to eat.

192
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:18,244
Daoming Si.
Thank you for treating me to lunch.

193
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,682
Thank you for ordering
that breakfast van for me.

194
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,684
Thank you for going shopping with Yesha.

195
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,586
Thank you for making Yesha so happy.

196
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,222
What's with all these thank yous?

197
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,257
You thanked me first.

198
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,128
Let's make a deal. Neither of us will
say thank you anymore.

199
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,466
Deal.

200
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,203
Bye-bye.

201
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:48,875
<i>Silly, answer the phone.</i>

202
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:50,076
Hello.

203
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:51,611

Hello.

207
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,009
Nouveau riche. What's the matter?

208
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:13,426
Daoming Si, right here.

209
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,572
Daoming Si, please take a seat.

210
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,908
Yeah. Feel free to sit. Be my guest.

211
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,792
Sir, excuse me. What would you like?

212
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:51,464
-One coconut juice.
-Okay, thank you.

213
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:00,306
Didn't you tell me there's an emergency?
Why are you silent?

214
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,243
Oh, let's get started.

215
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:06,212
-Mimi.
-What? Okay.

216
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,016
Hold on.

217
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,019
Daoming Si, here's the thing.

218
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:16,522
You don't need to thank me
for what will happen next.

219
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:19,258
Everything I'm doing is for Shancai.

220
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:21,327
For Shancai?

221
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:23,596
What are you up to?

222
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,464
I'm up to nothing.

223
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,800
I'm the messenger God sent to save you.

224
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:31,937
-Save me--
-Fine.

225
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,241
If you insist on thanking me, then...

226
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,878
You can recognize me as an official
member of F4, which will be F5.

227
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,112
Mimi, you can start now.

228
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,582
Daoming Si.

229
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:46,819
I am Mimi, your junior from Yingde,
at your service now.

230
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,723
"The whole story happened
on the first day of school.

231
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,527
Shancai's braveness pissed Daoming Si,
the leader of F4.

232
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:59,298
He decided to punish Shancai for her
tough weed spirit using the red note.

233
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,232
Unexpectedly,

234
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,702
Daoming Si fell in love with Shancai
because of this."

235
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:05,237
<i>Is this your pair of shoes?</i>

236
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:07,506
My shoes!

237
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,211
You've been bullying me
since the beginning of this semester.

238
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:13,579
You big pig head!

239
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:17,383
"So, at your birthday party,

240
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,652
Shancai teased your cruel mother.

241
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:26,425
The cookies made by Shancai herself

242
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:28,427
became your favorite birthday present."

243
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:33,899
That was baked at my workplace.

244
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,267
They're a little overbaked.

245
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:41,107
"And because of Meizuo's fateful
game of darts,

246
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:44,643
you decided to go to Barcelona
for your graduation trip.

247
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:47,213
Unfortunately,

248
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,983
on the day Daoming Si
would propose to Shancai,

249
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:54,620
he was caught in a car accident
in Barcelona.

250
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,958
When Daoming Si woke up from his injury,

251
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:02,895
he has forgotten his favorite Shancai."

252
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,599
That's all. It's over.

253
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,271
Daoming Si.

254
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,340
Daoming Si.

255
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:15,941
Do you remember it?

256
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:19,178
I am really the key to your memory.

257
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,894
The reason you wanted
to suddenly meet me was Shancai.

258
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:40,733
You wanted to tell me about the past.

259
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:43,803
Yes.

260
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:46,572
Don't you know how much
you loved Shancai in the past?

261
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:49,275
Don't you know how pitiful Shancai is?

262
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,880
<i>Now I've realized that she's here
with a motive.</i>

263
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:57,416
<i>She's trying to find chances</i>

264
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,485
<i>to meddle in your relationship with Yesha.</i>

265
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,489
She knew how to seize the opportunity

266
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:10,362
to show her innocence and put the fault
of the car accident on Yesha.

267
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:14,366
Thus, Yesha would sink into shame
and regret.

268
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:18,437
She wants Yesha to give you back to her.

269
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:21,240
This won't do.
You have to say it more seriously.

270
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:23,342
Like you're both angry and sorry
at the same time.

271
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:24,243
Let's do it again.

272
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,111
<i>Silly, answer the phone.</i>

273
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,518
Daoming Si.

274
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:33,886
Don't worry.

275
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,255
All you need to do is accept my help.

276
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:38,123
And you'll regain your memory in no time.

277
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,692
You'll soon remember,

278
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:47,433
that the one Daoming Si loves is Shancai.

279
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:49,101
-Daoming Si, do you remember or not?
-Enough!

280
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,504
Even if I regain my memory,
I won't fall in love with Shancai.

281
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:54,440
Daoming Si!

282
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:02,715
He said that he won't fall in love
with Shancai. What does that mean?

283
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,417
Qinghe.

284
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:09,688
I think Daoming Si was just venting on us.

285
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:12,391
So, to be precise,

286
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:14,126
he...

287
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,828
seemed to be angry.

288
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,063
Angry?

289
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,800
After all I've done,
why would he be angry?

290
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:25,170
How could Daoming Si
take my whole day's work for nothing?

291
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:30,376
Your work will never go to waste, Qinghe.

292
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:34,480
Even if Daoming Si doesn't understand you,

293
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,917
and Shancai as well,

294
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:40,619
at least you have me.

295
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,422
I totally understand your kindness.

296
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:46,558
So, Qinghe,

297
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:48,661
you have to try harder.

298
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:54,033
What's the point of it if you're
the only one who understands me?

299
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,136
Mimi. What should I do?

300
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,538
Don't worry.

301
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,307
We can conduct plan B right now.

302
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:03,309
There's a plan B?

303
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:06,178
Mimi, how could you have so many plans?

304
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,846
<i>Considering the symptoms you described,</i>

305
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:16,782
<i>maybe the blood clot
in your brain is dissolving.</i>

306
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,117
<i>That's to say,</i>

307
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:22,021
<i>you will gradually regain your memory
while the blood clot is being dissolved.</i>

308
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:24,623
<i>However, it's still too early
to congratulate you.</i>

309
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,293
<i>We'll know the details
after we get the test results.</i>

310
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,030
<i>Nevertheless, congratulations,
you're regaining your memory back.</i>

311
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,256
<i>I found it.</i>

312
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:38,030
The Brave Yesha!

313
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,265
How are you?

314
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:45,204
I'm fine.

315
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,207
How are you?

316
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:51,076
I'm not very well.

317
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:53,879
I want to go traveling.

318
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:55,914
Then we'll go traveling.

319
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:58,584
You're back.

320
00:27:02,588 --> 00:27:03,655
We'll leave tomorrow.

321
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,457
Or now?

322
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:07,092
Okay, let's go, let's leave--

323
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:08,393
-What are you doing?
-Ah Xing.

324
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:10,929
Don't you want to go traveling?

325
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:12,364
What are we waiting for?

326
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:14,399
It's true that I want to travel,
but not now.

327
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,300
Why not?

328
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,703
-Because you haven't regained your memory.
-What do you mean?

329
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,538
What Yesha means is,

330
00:27:19,605 --> 00:27:23,208
if you have some symptoms again
from the car accident on the road--

331
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:24,343
Don't worry.

332
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:25,978
I'll get over it.

333
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,180
I've made up my mind.

334
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,915
We'll go traveling tomorrow.

335
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:31,717
What's the hurry?

336
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:36,522
Ah Xing, I think you're running away
from something.

337
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,657
-It's like...
-Running away from what?

338
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,561
I don't want Yesha and me
to be disturbed by others.

339
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:48,167
So, if we go on a happy trip,

340
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,636
I promise that things
will get better for us.

341
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:52,604
Okay?

342
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:54,473
Okay.

343
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:56,108
We'll go traveling.

344
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:58,710
We'll go after you see my present for you.

345
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:00,212
Present?

346
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:01,747
Follow me.

347
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:07,686
This is for you.

348
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:11,957
Why are you giving me a present now?

349
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,058
Because.

350
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:20,098
Don't forget that you'll travel with me
after I see this.

351
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:21,400
Yeah, I won't.

352
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:24,670
Here we go.

353
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:32,411
<i>MEMORY: FROM MIND TO MOLECULES</i>

354
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:37,749
Why this?

355
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,653
I think it might help you.

356
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:46,592
Help?

357
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:50,062
Help with what?

358
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:54,333
Help me regain my memories of Shancai?

359
00:28:57,603 --> 00:28:59,738
Why is Shancai always more important
than me?

360
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,412
Ever since her appearance,

361
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:11,116
you've treated me differently.

362
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,019
Why?

363
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:15,621
Tell me why!

364
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,690
Because it's all my fault.

365
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:23,262
Because if it wasn't for me,
you and Shancai wouldn't be like this.

366
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:29,368
So you're helping me regain my memory
so you can return me to Shancai.

367
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,408
Do I mean nothing to you?

368
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:41,113
What is the engagement to you?

369
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:44,349
What am I to you?

370
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:46,918
Ah Xing.

371
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:48,887
Ah...

372
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:50,589
Ah Xing.

373
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:56,862
You want me to regain memory.

374
00:29:58,497 --> 00:29:59,398
Fine.

375
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:02,768
But I'll tell you loud and clear.

376
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:05,137
Even if I regain my memory,

377
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,039
I will not love Shancai again!

378
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:10,475
The harder you push me to her,
the more I hate her!

379
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:11,476
Ah Xing.

380
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:13,378
You can't do this to Shancai.

381
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:14,846
Yesha!

382
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:18,684
I'm begging you.

383
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,455
Don't make me hate you too, okay?

384
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:31,096
What's wrong, Ah Xing?

385
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,134
What happened?

386
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:37,703
Why were you yelling?

387
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:41,606
It's okay that he hates me.

388
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,376
It's okay.

389
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:47,579
Nothing's okay.

390
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:57,983
I hope you hate me.

391
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:01,586
I hope...

392
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:21,406
Okay, thanks.

393
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,874
Got it.

394
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:24,476
Please wait!

395
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,613
Daoming Si!

396
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:48,967
To bully you,

397
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:52,404
I dragged your bike with my car.

398
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:54,606
To bully you,

399
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:57,275
I made everyone in Yingde go against you.

400
00:32:58,844 --> 00:33:03,415
Unexpectedly, everything I did
made me fall in love with you.

401
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,451
You remember.

402
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:17,762
It's not me who remembers it.

403
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,631
It's your friend, Qinghe.

404
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,303
I just want to tell you.

405
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:28,406
I'm trying my best to regain my memory.

406
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:31,443
But I'm not doing it for you.

407
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:33,612
It's for Yesha.

408
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:37,282
No matter how many memories we had before,

409
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,551
Yesha is the one I love.

410
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,789
So please stop taking advantage of
your friends who care about you

411
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:48,226
to force me to come back to you.

412
00:33:48,894 --> 00:33:49,794
Daoming Si.

413
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,632
Taking advantage of friends.

414
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,569
Do you think I'm that kind of person
who will take advantage of friends?

415
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,041
Today, I finally know

416
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,777
that you've really
completely forgotten me.

417
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:08,413
You've really forgotten.

418
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:11,516
That's right.

419
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,219
I just want you to know

420
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,288
that unimportant people

421
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:18,156
and unimportant things,

422
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:21,559
even if I have memories of them,

423
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:23,728
I have already forgotten them.

424
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:39,911
You mustn't cry.

425
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:42,280
Shancai, you mustn't cry.

426
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:45,550
This Daoming Si is not worth crying over.

427
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:47,852
Not worth...

428
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:36,061
QINGHE CALLING

429
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:56,548
What's wrong, Qinghe?

430
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:58,316
Did he hang up again?

431
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:03,988
It seems we have to go to F3 for help.

432
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:21,506
After the Valentine's Day event,

433
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,208
I think you already know

434
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:25,777
that I, Qinghe,
will get everything covered.

435
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:26,978
Do you agree with me?

436
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:28,947
-So--
-Qinghe.

437
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:30,682
Get to the point.

438
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,651
My point is,

439
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:36,488
arrange a meeting with Daoming Si for me.

440
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:40,191
Won't Ah Si recognize you
when he sees you?

441
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,726
Why don't you do it yourself?

442
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:45,463
But...

443
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,766
Because...

444
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,937
Mimi. You do the talking.

445
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:54,072
Okay.

446
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,810
Hi to you, the handsome, cool,
and tough, Ximen.

447
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,646
This is how it goes.

448
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:05,650
Because Qinghe found that he is
Daoming Si's key to his memory.

449
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:10,221
For Shancai's happiness, he decided
to help Daoming Si regain his memory.

450
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:13,291
So he met with Daoming Si,

451
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:18,396
and I narrated the detailed love history
of him and Shancai.

452
00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:24,302
But Daoming Si left angrily
with no reason.

453
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:28,039
And he won't pick up Qinghe's call again.

454
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:30,475
That's it.

455
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:36,981
Qinghe.

456
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:40,652
You've created many miracles
with sheer luck.

457
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:42,954
But I can't help you with this.

458
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,356
What? You can't?

459
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,258
How could you?

460
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,360
Aren't you F4?

461
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:51,963
Isn't Daoming Si your friend?

462
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:56,100
Don't you want
to restore your friend's memory?

463
00:38:57,135 --> 00:38:59,137
Ah Si is our friend.

464
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:02,674
No matter what he becomes,
he will always be our friend.

465
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:06,277
I know you're doing this out of kindness.

466
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:07,912
But I have to remind you,

467
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,515
that what you're doing to Ah Si

468
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:13,685
might destroy the new relationship Shancai
and him built with a lot of effort.

469
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,754
What do you mean?

470
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:21,626
What I mean is,
you should stop this crazy plan.

471
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:24,429
Then what about Shancai?

472
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:26,998
Did you ever care about Shancai?

473
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:33,338
Do you want to see Daoming Si marrying
that princess of Bhutan?

474
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,474
Of course, I don't.
Shancai won't be happy about it.

475
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,310
But you can't force someone to love.

476
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:41,880
I think you understand this.

477
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,549
You mean...

478
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:47,952
I love Shancai.

479
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:49,754
But Shancai...

480
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:52,390
But it isn't right.

481
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:54,359
Because...

482
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,494
Because...

483
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:59,063
Because the one Daoming Si loves
is Shancai.

484
00:39:59,130 --> 00:39:59,964
Yes.

485
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:02,967
That was something in the past.

486
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,470
Ah Si is in love with Yesha now.

487
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:09,474
I'm sorry, but this is the truth.

488
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,777
I have things to attend to.
I'm leaving now.

489
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:14,412
Ximen.

490
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:18,216
Ximen!

491
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:21,085
You can't do this to me.

492
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:22,787
Lei and Meizuo won't help me.

493
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:25,189
You're everything Shancai got, Ximen.

494
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,231
Fine. Suit yourself.

495
00:40:33,665 --> 00:40:36,501
Who knows if you're jealous about the fact
I'm the only one Daoming Si remembers?

496
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:38,136
He remembers me, Qinghe!

497
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:40,738
F3 lacks loyalty.

498
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,040
F3 lacks bravery.

499
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,408
F3...

500
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:44,742
sucks!

501
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:47,312
You're right.

502
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:51,950
I thought they were handsome
and cool and tough.

503
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:54,185
I now know that my dad is right.

504
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:58,222
A disloyal man is useless no matter how
handsome or how cool he is.

505
00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:59,824
You tell me.

506
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:03,227
You are the only real man.

507
00:41:05,363 --> 00:41:06,464
Mimi.

508
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:09,600
What are we supposed to do now?

509
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,270
Daoming Si won't pick up my call.

510
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,239
F3 won't help us.

511
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:19,310
How should we conduct plan B?

512
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:25,750
As the saying goes,

513
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,852
"Let he who tied the bell take it off."

514
00:41:28,353 --> 00:41:29,487
What does that mean?

515
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:32,056
I mean,

516
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,826
someone tied a bell somewhere.

517
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:38,296
When the night came, the bell sound
kept everyone from sleeping.

518
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:41,232
Someone wanted to untie the bell.

519
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:42,834
However--

520
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,935
Mimi.

521
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,037
Get to the point.

522
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:47,905
All right, Qinghe.

523
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:49,374
My point is,

524
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,176
how about we ask
that princess of Bhutan for help.

525
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:57,081
Princess of Bhutan...

526
00:41:57,949 --> 00:41:58,983
Right.

527
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:00,752
How didn't I think of that?

528
00:42:05,223 --> 00:42:06,190
<i>I'm Qinghe.</i>

529
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:09,293
<i>I'm a very close friend of Daoming Si.</i>

530
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,996
<i>Since we are such good friends,</i>

531
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:13,831
<i>and tomorrow is a day off,</i>

532
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:16,501
<i>how about going for a swim
with me and Shancai?</i>

533
00:42:20,438 --> 00:42:22,040
<i>Even if I regain my memory,</i>

534
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:23,508
<i>I will not love Shancai again!</i>

535
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:26,010
The harder you push me to her,
the more I hate her!

536
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,113
Yesha!

537
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:33,151
I'm begging you.

538
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:37,355
Don't make me hate you too, okay?

539
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:00,338
Why are you silent?

540
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,709
You're the one who wants
to meet me, right?

541
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:09,947
How would I know if you're still mad
or not, if you don't talk first?

542
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:11,749
Do you want me to leave you alone?

543
00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:28,633
Ah Si.

544
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:32,570
Ah Xing.

545
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:39,844
Promise me that you won't do
such silly things, okay?

546
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:43,548
You promise me that you'll go swimming
with Shancai,

547
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:45,783
-and everyone makes peace with each other.
-Hey.

548
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,552
You're so bossy.

549
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:49,053
You're asking a lot.

550
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,489
How can there be fiancées like you?

551
00:44:51,923 --> 00:44:53,090
Suit yourself.

552
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:55,326
I'll break off our engagement.

553
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,461
You...

554
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:02,400
Tell me you're joking.

555
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:03,768
I am.

556
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:05,636
Don't joke like that!

557
00:45:06,604 --> 00:45:08,306
Didn't you just say you won't yell again?

558
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,974
Then don't joke like that!

559
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:17,815
What's wrong with you?
Don't you have a good temper?

560
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:19,951
Why do you keep getting angry lately?

561
00:45:25,323 --> 00:45:26,791
It's all because of you.

562
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:31,796
What, you said I'm bossy?
You're bossier than me.

563
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:36,601
Throwing a tantrum while accusing me
of bad temper. Lunatic.

564
00:45:39,604 --> 00:45:40,738
Don't be like this to me.

565
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,583
Will you go tomorrow?

566
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:54,952
Go where?

567
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:56,120
Go swimming.

568
00:45:56,821 --> 00:45:57,822
Swimming with whom?

569
00:45:58,189 --> 00:45:59,123
Shancai.

570
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,558
Why do I have to go swimming with her?

571
00:46:01,392 --> 00:46:02,393
Just go.

572
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:04,929
You're always...

573
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:08,332
Whatever.

574
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:27,978
