1
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:27,214
You can't take that!

2
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:31,251
You can get anything except the ring!

3
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,293
That is Ah Xing's ring.

4
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,928
I said you can't take that away!

5
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:52,906
Don't run!

6
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,544
Don't run!

7
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:00,013
Give me back the ring! Don't run!

8
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,050
Let go of me!

9
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,052
Ah Xing.

10
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,520
What are you doing?

11
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,256
Yesha.

12
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:13,727
Yesha.

13
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:14,828
Yesha!

14
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,481
What were you doing?

15
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,450
I was running after the thief.

16
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,721
You risked your life
just to catch the thief?

17
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,589
It's because he stole your ring...

18
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,157
Your ring.

19
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:45,592
Enough.

20
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,028
It's long gone.
Do you think it would wait for you?

21
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:50,197
But the ring is so important to you.

22
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,403
Forget it.

23
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,978
Don't do something that stupid
in the future, okay?

24
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:08,115
I risked my life for you,
yet you're telling me off.

25
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,488
To me, a ring I have no memories of...

26
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,193
cannot be compared to a true friend.

27
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:32,739
Why are you smiling?

28
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:40,714
You're smiling!

29
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,350
This is the first time
I've seen you smile.

30
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,618
Ah Xing smiled.

31
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:47,154
Look at yourself.
It would be strange if I don't smile.

32
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,122
-Stupid girl.
-Smile again.

33
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:50,791
Go away. You stink.

34
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,560
You're the one who's stinky.

35
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:54,795
It hurts.

36
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,464
Ah Xing smiled. Come on, smile again.

37
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,966
Go away! Are you stupid or something?

38
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:04,371
Make a loop with your left hand

39
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,306
then circle around it
with your right hand.

40
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,743
Draw it out from there and pull tightly.

41
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,679
-Let's do this together again.
-Make a loop with your left hand.

42
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:15,515
-Circle around it with your right hand.
-Circle around it with your right hand.

43
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:17,284
-Draw it out from there.
-Draw it out from there.

44
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,318
Pull it tightly.

45
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:19,553
Pull tightly.

46
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,489
Again.

47
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:25,525
Make a loop with your left hand.

48
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,562
Circle around it with your right hand.

49
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,697
Draw it out from there.

50
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,065
Pull tightly.

51
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,968
I don't know how to do it.

52
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,607
Don't be angry at yourself.

53
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,876
You should learn to like yourself.

54
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,222
Do you know how lucky you are?

55
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,325
Others only have one life,

56
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,260
yet you have two.

57
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:06,900
Don't we always say how good it would be
if we can live our life all over again?

58
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:10,503
Aren't you living it again?

59
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,575
We've forgotten
when we learned to tie our shoelaces.

60
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:19,613
We've forgotten
how happy we were when we finally did it.

61
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:22,482
You're very fortunate.

62
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,718
You can experience it all over again.

63
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,522
Let's do this again, okay?

64
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:46,873
Make a loop with your left hand.

65
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:48,808
Circle around with your right hand.

66
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:52,412
Draw it out from the middle
then pull tightly.

67
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,015
Let's do it again.

68
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,683
Okay? From the start.

69
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,251
Make a loop with your left hand,

70
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,553
Circle around it with your right.

71
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:04,391
Draw it out from the middle
then pull tightly.

72
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,228
Let's do it again.

73
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:10,630
Make a loop with the left hand

74
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,833
-Right hand...
-How can I be so stupid?

75
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,792
Make a loop with your left hand.

76
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,361
Circle around it with your right hand.

77
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,931
Then push it in there.

78
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:47,701
Make a loop with the left hand.

79
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,403
Circle around it with the right hand.

80
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:53,173
Then push it inside.

81
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,713
Make a loop with your left hand.

82
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,483
Circle around it with your right.

83
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,855
Make a loop with your left hand.

84
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,258
Circle around it with the right hand.

85
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:36,983
Why are you laughing like an idiot?

86
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,787
That's the tidiest bow I've ever seen.

87
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,570
Wow, I also have one.

88
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:01,408
Cool, a bow that Ah Xing made for me.

89
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:23,496
Lei.

90
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,499
Which side is Daoming Si's dimple?

91
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:30,904
Oh, god.

92
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:32,972
I forgot.

93
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,009
How can I have forgotten?

94
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,580
His dimples are inside your heart.

95
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:42,816
You didn't forget.

96
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,218
Otherwise, how did you think of it now?

97
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:52,559
Lei.

98
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,527
Can I ask you a question?

99
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:01,468
Who told you about the legend?

100
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,036
Is there a continuation to the legend?

101
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:10,143
I found out about the legend
from a fairy tale.

102
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,346
There's no continuation to the legend.

103
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:17,117
So it's not like you and Ah Si
won't have a future.

104
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,455
Lei.

105
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:26,793
In the fairy tale,
does it have a legend about the ring, too?

106
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,927
Shancai.

107
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:32,732
There are tons of legends
in all corners of the world.

108
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,636
But true love is not found in legends.

109
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:41,808
Only those who do not believe in love
rely on legends to live their daily lives.

110
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,411
If you believe in the love
Ah Si has for you,

111
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,383
you should forget about the legend
and hold on to the truth until the end.

112
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,487
Thank you, Lei.

113
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,093
It's so funny.

114
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:02,629
We're both not meant for this church.

115
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,268
What should I do?

116
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,069
I suddenly feel like standing upside down.

117
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,346
<i>Lei, you lied to me.</i>

118
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,915
<i>What?</i>

119
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:24,817
<i>You'll still shed tears
even if you're standing upside down.</i>

120
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,356
How nice.

121
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:33,459
It's so hot.

122
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,827
Let's sit down here.

123
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:05,425
What are you doing?

124
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,263
Classified ads.

125
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,834
You can look for houses,
for work, and find the things you lost.

126
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,169
You can also look for a person.

127
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:20,106
Does that mean
we can also find "memories"?

128
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,576
That's so great. Thank you!

129
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,714
-Let's go.
-What for?

130
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,582
-Let's go, I'll tell you later.
-Where are we going?

131
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:31,584
-Let's go, hurry!
-Who's that?

132
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,669
-What are we doing here?
-Go inside and you'll find out.

133
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:51,838
Hurry.

134
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:54,707
Stand straight.

135
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,143
-Okay, look here.
-What are you doing?

136
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,512
Look here, on that side.
You'll find out later.

137
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:00,647
Smile.

138
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:03,349
I'm not a fool to smile at a machine.

139
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,518
Don't look at me.
Look over there and smile.

140
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,128
Look.

141
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:18,998
This person looks like Mr. Daoming Si.

142
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,300
Let me see.

143
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,203
He really looks like him.

144
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:28,675
How can someone put an ad
looking for himself?

145
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,712
Male, in his twenties, lost himself.

146
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,848
Relatives and friends of this person,
please contact him.

147
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,184
He lost himself?

148
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:39,819
-This is too silly to be true.
-That's right.

149
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:42,455
Based on that alone,
he's nothing like Mr. Daoming Si.

150
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:47,360
That's right. Even if they look alike,
their lives are so different.

151
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:51,064
Our Mr. Daoming Si
is with Shancai right now,

152
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,766
romantically roaming
in the streets of Barcelona.

153
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:58,538
They're eating steak, having wine,
and dancing the flamenco.

154
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,176
What are you doing? That's my omelet.

155
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,244
-That's mine.
-Well... I...

156
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,080
You dropped it.

157
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,648
I dropped it. So it's dirty.

158
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:10,650
You won't eat it
because it's dirty, right?

159
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,618
In that case, I'll just eat it, right?

160
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,520
Who said so? That's mine.

161
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,322
You dropped yours too.

162
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:19,625
-It's dirty. You can eat that, right?
-You took mine again.

163
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:21,928
-Okay, you eat it.
-I'm eating this.

164
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,772
LOOKING FOR HIMSELF.
MALE, 20s, LOST HIMSELF.

165
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,041
FRIENDS AND RELATIVES, PLEASE CALL HIM

166
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,487
Who are you?

167
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,523
It's really you.

168
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,359
Ah Si.

169
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:55,128
Who are you?

170
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:56,996
I am Zhongze.

171
00:14:58,464 --> 00:14:59,298
Zhong...

172
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,235
Sorry, he can't remember anything.

173
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:08,975
I was so surprised
after reading the newspaper.

174
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,376
How did it happen?

175
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,311
You really can't remember anything?

176
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:16,883
I can't even remember my name.

177
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:19,886
We all call you Ah Si.

178
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,687
Your full name is Daoming Si.

179
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,856
"Daoming Si"?

180
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,192
Does it ring a bell?

181
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:28,928
Daoming Si?

182
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:31,931
It doesn't ring a bell.

183
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,669
It's fine, take it slow.

184
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,271
I'll help you.

185
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:39,572
Come.

186
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,384
How are you related to Daoming Si?

187
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,454
It's actually funny.

188
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,157
We actually knew each other from a fight.

189
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,827
We had a misunderstanding back then

190
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,062
that's why we fought.

191
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:06,299
In the end, we became good friends.

192
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,134
Is he good at fighting?

193
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:09,669
In Yingde University,

194
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,604
everyone's afraid of him.

195
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:14,774
At that time, whenever Ah Si
gives a red card to a person,

196
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:16,642
the best way for that person
to live a peaceful life

197
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,011
is to drop out of school.

198
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,380
Yingde University?

199
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,282
You really don't remember anything?

200
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:25,918
You don't even remember
graduating from Yingde University?

201
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:30,356
I...

202
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,401
Is the house moving?

203
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:50,610
Perhaps the sun in Taiwan is too strong.

204
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,545
You had too much sun.

205
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,748
But Ah Si is still Ah Si.

206
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,751
Although you had an accident
and lost your memory,

207
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:03,122
you can still get
such a beautiful girl so quickly.

208
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,626
What about that fierce girl
you were dating before?

209
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,161
-Did you ditch her already?
-What are you talking about?

210
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:18,037
Do you still remember Ximen?

211
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,306
Ximen?

212
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,776
Your good friend and ally, Ximen.

213
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:44,664
<i>I'm coming!</i>

214
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,939
Mr. Ximen and Meizuo,
what brings you here?

215
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:56,309
Shancai asked us to come here.

216
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,978
Shancai? What happened?

217
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:02,949
<i>Missing?</i>

218
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,617
<i>How can this be?</i>

219
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,820
No, how is Shancai now?

220
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:11,023
Shancai wants to stay in Spain
to get more news.

221
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,858
But Mr. and Mrs. Dong, don't worry.

222
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,427
Lei also stayed there to keep her company.

223
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,763
How can this happen?

224
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,633
How can a person who was fine
suddenly go missing?

225
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,901
That's right.

226
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,537
Wait.

227
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:26,706
The newspaper!

228
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,441
Where's the newspaper?

229
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:31,143
-Newspaper?
-The other day,

230
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:35,247
I saw someone who looked
like Mr. Daoming Si in that newspaper.

231
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:39,151
-That newspaper?
-Right, that one.

232
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,820
-Quick, go get it.
-I'll look for it.

233
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,622
-Go quickly. Hurry.
-I'll go get it.

234
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:50,896
Hurry, not this one!

235
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,032
-Okay, I'm looking for it.
-Is it there?

236
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:54,066
It's here.

237
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,434
It's here, I found it.

238
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,271
Are you sure it's Ah Si?

239
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:03,509
Yes. He said he's looking for himself
and for friends and relatives.

240
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,312
How can this happen?

241
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:13,119
Now that I think about it again,
I am 100% sure that he is Daoming Si.

242
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:14,587
-That's right.
-Yes.

243
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,022
Look, I knew it.

244
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,823
Regardless, let's make a call first.

245
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,858
Okay.

246
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:22,428
A PERSON LOOKING FOR HIMSELF

247
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:32,705
-It's all your fault.
-I--

248
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:35,741
You stole my omelet and kept eating.
It's all your fault.

249
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:39,111
No, how would I know
this would happen, right?

250
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,746
Otherwise, not just omelets,

251
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:43,749
even if there are cakes,
egg rolls, egg tarts,

252
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:46,752
dandan noodles, egg drop soup,
I wouldn't steal them from you.

253
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:49,855
I wouldn't have an appetite.
How would I be able to eat?

254
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,492
It's fine.

255
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,194
There are only 100 possibilities.

256
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:56,629
We can surely figure it out.

257
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,934
LOOKING FOR HIMSELF.
MALE, 20s, LOST HIMSELF.

258
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:04,003
FRIENDS AND RELATIVES, PLEASE CALL HIM

259
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:20,753
You're awake.

260
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,055
Master Daoming Si.

261
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,357
Who are you?

262
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:26,559
Me?

263
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,060
I am Zhongze.

264
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,830
You never thought
you would see this day, right?

265
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,499
Don't you say you didn't expect this

266
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,035
because I didn't even think
I would see this day.

267
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,506
Didn't we know each other from a fight?

268
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,975
We did have a fight.

269
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,344
But what a shame. We're not friends.

270
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:48,314
If I remember correctly,

271
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,950
you punched me twice.

272
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:54,253
Your friend Ximen also punched me twice.

273
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:57,823
And your ex-girlfriend
also punched me once.

274
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:03,062
Five punches in exchange for this.

275
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:04,964
It's so not worth it.

276
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,132
What do you want?

277
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:08,067
What do I want?

278
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:10,503
I want some money.

279
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,640
I forgot that you lost your memories.

280
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,442
Surely you don't remember

281
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:20,479
that the Daoming family
is widely known to be a very wealthy one.

282
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:25,451
You're just scum.

283
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:27,520
Be careful with your language.

284
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,488
You are my hostages.

285
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:32,057
Your tae kwon do and karate
are useless now.

286
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:34,460
But don't worry.

287
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,529
As long as you do what I want,

288
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:39,765
I'll definitely leave
once I get the money.

289
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:42,835
In the end, you're also after that.

290
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:48,307
You're griping because you wasted
your efforts.

291
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:52,044
I'm griping because I have such bad luck.

292
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:53,813
You busted my heist.

293
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:56,215
I busted your heist?

294
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,252
God, are we thinking of the same thing?

295
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:03,022
Otherwise, do you think
someone will be that kindhearted?

296
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,024
You got a point there.

297
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,692
How much did you intend to ask?

298
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:07,693
How about you?

299
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:08,994
Five million.

300
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:11,997
Do you have any experience or not?

301
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,232
You do?

302
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,234
I already lured him back to Taiwan.

303
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:16,669
Do you think I have experience or not?

304
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,139
What are you laughing at?

305
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:25,511
I am laughing at myself
for trying so hard to know who I am,

306
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,948
but I didn't even know who you are.

307
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:32,284
The star?

308
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,753
Saving me again?

309
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:37,289
Those are all bullshit.

310
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,325
Didn't you say I was trying
to pacify a child?

311
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:40,693
I was.

312
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:43,462
What are you two talking about?

313
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:44,797
Shut up.

314
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:48,334
From the time your mother
appeared at the winery,

315
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,702
that whole shebang,

316
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:52,404
I've already calculated
the big amount of cash I'll get.

317
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:55,407
Your every step was part of my plan.

318
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:58,878
If you didn't do such a stupid thing,

319
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:00,980
I would have already
gotten 100 million New Taiwan dollars.

320
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,114
One hundred million?

321
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:06,785
Everything is ruined
because of you, you idiot.

322
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:08,854
What do you mean?

323
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,824
In this situation,

324
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:15,027
do you think you can get
the money and run?

325
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:22,635
You did not get his trust
to let him willingly give you the money.

326
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:26,038
Even if you get the money,
you can't get away with it.

327
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,644
You used my trust as your bargaining chip.

328
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,080
You're such a genius.

329
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:36,448
Sorry.

330
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:41,220
I originally wanted to leave
a beautiful memory in your heart.

331
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:46,225
Who knew this stupid person
would ruin my perfect plan?

332
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:51,130
It left a dark shadow
in your child-like soul.

333
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:01,573
Yesha, you're right.

334
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,975
What should we do now?

335
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:04,209
It's hopeless.

336
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:08,314
Don't say that.
Think of something. Use your brain.

337
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,716
You want me to use my brain
tied up like this?

338
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:14,954
All right.

339
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:19,191
You can use your brain this way, right?

340
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:23,462
What shall we do then?

341
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:24,530
Do as I say.

342
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,032
No problem.

343
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:28,701
How much money can we get?

344
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,538
At least 50 million.

345
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:34,640
Fifty million?

346
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,211
What should we do now?

347
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:41,680
Please.

348
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:43,449
You have his home number, right?

349
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,151
Home number...

350
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:10,142
Welcome back, madam.

351
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:11,543
I already prepared your bath.

352
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,278
Did Daoming Si call?

353
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,613
Let me report to you, Madam.

354
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,549
Young Master must still be
in Spain right now.

355
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,985
Madam.

356
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:21,520
What's the matter? You're panicking.

357
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:23,389
It's an urgent call.

358
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,357
They said Young Master is in their hands.

359
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:26,425
They want 50 million.

360
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:28,193
What? Speak clearly.

361
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,561
Young Master has been kidnapped.

362
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:30,462
What?

363
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,464
Connect the call upstairs.

364
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,668
Ask someone to track
where the call is coming from.

365
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:38,704
Yes, Madam. Hurry.

366
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:41,006
What? Daoming Si is missing?

367
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,411
I told you I should have gone
to Spain with Shancai.

368
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,813
See? She must need someone
to take care of her right now, right?

369
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,948
That's not the point, Qinghe.

370
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:51,917
Then the point is...

371
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:53,552
The point is we have to make calls now.

372
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:54,887
You are in charge of these numbers.

373
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:02,861
Hello?

374
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:04,463
Sorry, wrong number.

375
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,398
Hey, nouveau riche,
aren't you going to make calls?

376
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,802
I mean, if I call them one by one,
when can I be done?

377
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:11,737
Do you want me to beat you up?

378
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:14,073
No, but isn't this a bit stupid?

379
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:15,674
-You...
-Meizuo!

380
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:16,809
Forget it.

381
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:22,247
I just wanted to ask

382
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,316
why we're not going to the library
to find the newspaper?

383
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:26,018
What did you say?

384
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:28,787
I mean, I just wanted to say...

385
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:29,788
I didn't say anything.

386
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:31,824
I didn't say we should find the newspaper
at the library.

387
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:48,707
What's with you?

388
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:53,178
His mother said she wants proof
that her son is in our hands.

389
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,114
I've already prepared for that.

390
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:04,423
You really planned everything.

391
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,392
Let's go and mail these photos.

392
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,194
You go by yourself.

393
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:11,997
Yesha.

394
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:13,365
You're so competent.

395
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:17,703
If I leave you alone with him
and you took him away,

396
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,204
what should I do then?

397
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,540
Isn't the key for the handcuff with you?

398
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:29,281
It is, but you are full of tricks.

399
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:31,650
It's inevitable to be wary of others.

400
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:33,886
Fine, I'll go with you then.

401
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:39,925
I found it.

402
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:50,903
Daoming Si is so funny.

403
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:53,772
It's really Ah Si.

404
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,807
Call Lei now.

405
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:00,245
That's great.

406
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:02,814
What are you doing?

407
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,650
Wait for me here.

408
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,385
We'll be back later. Let's go.

409
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,721
Let's go.

410
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:11,183
Mail this.

411
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:18,890
Okay, we can go now.

412
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:35,073
Shancai!

413
00:30:11,677 --> 00:30:12,911
No one is answering.

414
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,513
Then call again, quick!

415
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,159
Hello?

416
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,860
Hello, talk to me. Hello?

417
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:30,462
-Ah Si.
-Hello?

418
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:32,331
-Ah Si?
-Hello!

419
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:33,465
What happened?

420
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:36,301
There's no answer but I heard
someone making sounds.

421
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:37,936
-Hello, are you Ah Si?
-Ah Si!

422
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:41,540
Ah Si, hello...

423
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:44,776
The line's dead.

424
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:46,912
Ah Si may be in trouble!

425
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:50,382
We should find the address
for that phone number now. Hurry!

426
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,128
Daoming Si, I'm playing nice,
yet you don't appreciate it.

427
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,598
Why are you so angry?

428
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,568
He has tape over his mouth.

429
00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:11,670
What can he say on the phone?

430
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:13,805
I'm warning you. Don't play any tricks.

431
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,311
Don't be mad.

432
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:26,118
-Okay.
-Yesha.

433
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:35,193
After you get the money,
what would you do with it?

434
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:42,000
With that big amount of money,
perhaps I would go all out with my life.

435
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:43,802
Go all out?

436
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:48,273
But why do I feel like
you don't know how to go all out?

437
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,049
Why you do think so?

438
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:03,021
You look so tense right now.

439
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,791
So I know you're unable to go all out.

440
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,860
Please. How do I go all out now?

441
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,462
Why not?

442
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:14,399
What do you want to do then?

443
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:17,135
Let me teach you.

444
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,449
Turns out you like thrilling stuff.

445
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:31,783
All right.

446
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,268
Don't think that I am a fool.

447
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:03,682
Both of you want this key, don't you?

448
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:06,685
Give me...

449
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:44,449
Finally, someone is here.

450
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:46,051
Help me look for the key.

451
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:48,353
It should be around, on the floor. Hurry.

452
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:54,326
Where's Daoming Si?

453
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:40,271
Hey, you can't go inside!

454
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:47,012
I never thought you would move so quickly.

455
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,150
If you didn't mislead us,
we could have acted more quickly.

456
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,586
What right do you have to question me?

457
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,389
I wasn't the one who lost Ah Si in Spain.

458
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:01,059
I'm also not the one who made him
unable to return home now.

459
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:04,829
Mrs. Daoming, what do you mean?

460
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,398
You should ask yourselves.

461
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:11,002
Who among you made friends
with that Zhongze?

462
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:15,240
He thought he can kidnap Ah Si
to extort from me.

463
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:17,575
Zhongze?

464
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,044
Who's Zhongze?

465
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:21,913
Xiaoyou's ex-boyfriend!

466
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:24,416
That bastard.

467
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,430
It's really you. Where's Ah Si?

468
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:42,267
I told you.

469
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:45,303
Even if you beat me to death,
I don't know where he is.

470
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,839
Nonsense. It's impossible for you
to kidnap Ah Si alone.

471
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:49,074
How many accomplices do you have?

472
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,575
Where did you hide Ah Si?

473
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:51,776
Stop interrogating him.

474
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:56,181
I'll tell you what you wanted to know
on his behalf.

475
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,151
Ah Si had a car accident in Spain.

476
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:02,120
There was a severe impact on his brain.

477
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:04,489
He lost all his memories.

478
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:08,993
I don't know who brought
Ah Si back to Taiwan.

479
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:13,498
All of you have been saying
you're Ah Si's good friends.

480
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:16,701
But because you offended Zhongze,

481
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:20,004
this greedy guy grabbed the chance
to revenge

482
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:22,040
and took his anger out on Ah Si.

483
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:26,411
Now, we don't know where Ah Si is.

484
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:29,514
What do you have to say to me now?

485
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:38,356
Therefore, you don't need
to meddle with Ah Si's affairs.

486
00:37:44,963 --> 00:37:46,231
Especially you.

487
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:49,100
Now that Ah Si can't remember anything...

488
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:51,936
of course, that includes you.

489
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:54,506
Listen to me carefully.

490
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,008
He had forgotten you already.

491
00:37:58,143 --> 00:37:59,844
So he doesn't love you anymore.

492
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:04,382
So you better give up your hopes now.

493
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:10,021
Shancai, don't mind her.

494
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:19,731
Mrs. Daoming.

495
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,204
What?

496
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:28,173
You still refuse to give up?

497
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:31,109
No.

498
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:32,977
I just wanted to ask you.

499
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,913
Did Daoming Si also forget you?

500
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:38,583
That's none of your business.

501
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,654
Daoming Si had also forgotten you.

502
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:44,923
But you didn't lose hope, right?

503
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,227
I am his mother.

504
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,730
I am also a person who loves him
like you do.

505
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:57,101
So, no matter how much you hate me,

506
00:38:57,569 --> 00:39:00,672
and no matter who
and what Daoming Si becomes,

507
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:05,643
like you, I also want to find him
no matter what.

508
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,784
If you want to waste your time,
I can't do anything about it.

509
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:14,419
Listen carefully.

510
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:17,255
You can't report what happened
to Ah Si to the police.

511
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:18,556
You can't make a big fuss about it.

512
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,693
If Ah Si gets hurt because of you,

513
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,796
I'll definitely make you regret it.

514
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:44,649
No wonder he said he lost himself
in the newspaper.

515
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:53,424
Right now,
Ah Si is like an innocent baby...

516
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,894
who cannot protect himself.

517
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:00,498
Why did you treat Ah Si that way?

518
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:01,633
Meizuo.

519
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,801
Why?

520
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,407
Because life is unfair.

521
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,443
It's too unfair.

522
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:15,613
You have money and power.

523
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:19,317
You're favored by the heavens.

524
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,420
You can do everything you want.

525
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:26,057
Why can't I?

526
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,360
-Meizuo.
-Meizuo, no.

527
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:34,198
I only wanted to prove...

528
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:37,302
that when Daoming Si has nothing,

529
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:40,805
I can handle him.

530
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:44,375
The same goes...

531
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:47,445
for all of you.

532
00:40:48,313 --> 00:40:49,347
Shut up!

533
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,282
How dare you bully Ah Si that way.

534
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:53,384
That's right.

535
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:58,056
I thought I could handle him...

536
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:00,758
and revenge on him.

537
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:05,229
But God is still unfair.

00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,801
Not only did he manage to escape,

539
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:13,104
I also fell into your hands.

540
00:41:19,711 --> 00:41:20,745
That's fine.

541
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,181
That's fine.

542
00:41:25,183 --> 00:41:26,551
My life is cheap anyway.

543
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,456
If you want to hit me, do it.

544
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,524
Come on!

545
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,063
Ximen, what are you going to do?

546
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:44,268
Ximen, no!

547
00:43:01,846 --> 00:43:02,847
Leave.

548
00:43:11,656 --> 00:43:13,091
Shancai, I'm sorry,

549
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,226
I dragged Ah Si into this.
