1
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:11,465
Hey. Easy, okay? It hurts.

2
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,672
You can't feel the pain in my foot.
That's enough!

3
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,441
Did it hurt when you twisted your ankle?

4
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:22,709
Of course.

5
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:24,811
Then how can it not hurt
when it's being twisted back?

6
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,546
How could you get it fixed
without feeling pain?

7
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,619
You don't have to yell.

8
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,454
Why are you so mad?

9
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,958
Will you listen to me if I'm not mad?

10
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:41,361
How many times have I told you,
I wasn't the one who took Shancai's purse.

11
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:42,996
You wouldn't believe what I said.

12
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,631
You just had to blame it on me.

13
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:50,637
Fine.

14
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:53,273
Sorry about that.

15
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,279
But you were a thief after all.

16
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,283
You got history, so how can I believe you?

17
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,776
Ah Mei.

18
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,247
I've made up my mind.

19
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,349
I'll never do it again.

20
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,756
This time, I've really made up my mind.

21
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,426
This world...

22
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:21,995
I've seen everything in it.

23
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,365
Love, romance...

24
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,601
They're all meaningless.

25
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,038
Money is all that's important.

26
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:34,574
Without money,

27
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:37,410
you got nothing.

28
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:41,448
So?

29
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,485
So...

30
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,655
I am back now,

31
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,524
and I'll never leave again.

32
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,262
I want to stay here with you.

33
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:56,763
To take good care of you.

34
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:09,709
Ah Mei.

35
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:14,681
It will be the two of us
against the world, okay?

36
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:22,556
Ah De.

37
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,560
Your girlfriend dumped you, right?

38
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,266
You stole people's wallets,

39
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:35,335
and you stole people's money.

40
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:38,138
You would give all of them to her
just to please her.

41
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,942
But every time things went south,

42
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,678
I was always the one
cleaning up your mess.

43
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,584
Do you really think this kind of girl
will love you?

44
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:55,989
I knew.

45
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:00,060
I knew she didn't truly love me.

46
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,197
I'm a good-for-nothing fool.

47
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,768
That's why I ended up like this.

48
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:13,974
I'm sorry, too.

49
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,413
I thought I could just find some place...

50
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,117
and hide in there.

51
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,320
Wait for my death.

52
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:29,656
I'm fine with that.

53
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,527
But I thought about you, alone in here.

54
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,134
I couldn't leave you alone.

55
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:49,976
After Mom passed away,

56
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,113
there's just the two of us.

57
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,450
I'm okay with death.

58
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:02,589
But I didn't take good care of you.

59
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,295
I will never...

60
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,431
ever forgive myself.

61
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:24,711
Are you done?

62
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:28,315
I am telling you,

63
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,951
you owe me big time.

64
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,620
If you really want to make it up to me,

65
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:35,989
you should spend 800 years
repaying my favors.

66
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,927
And no more nonsense,

67
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,630
or I'll blow your brains out.

68
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,931
You hear me?

69
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:59,112
Does it still hurt?

70
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:03,817
Easy.

71
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,492
Hey.

72
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,829
If you keep throwing tantrums,
you really can't get married.

73
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:29,676
Hey.

74
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,153
Hello, this is Yesha.

75
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:42,622
Ah Si is watching me painting.

76
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,924
Hold on.

77
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:02,675
Maybe I paint too slowly,
Ah Si has fallen asleep.

78
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,179
Okay, I'll tell him.

79
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:07,247
Okay.

80
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,134
Did you have a fight with your mom?

81
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,571
No.

82
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:37,710
Then why are you ignoring her
since you came home from the hospital?

83
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,280
You don't even want to talk to her.

84
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,616
There's nothing to say to start with.

85
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:48,655
Actually, your mom really cares about you.

86
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,125
You told her you haven't fully recovered.

87
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,627
-You don't want to go to work--
-You're being weird.

88
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:57,330
You've always hated her.

89
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,300
Why do I get this feeling
that you're on her side?

90
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,110
Do you want tea or coffee?

91
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,344
I'll make some.

92
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:14,814
Yesha.

93
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:17,951
Sorry.

94
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:20,587
I didn't mean it.

95
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:22,755
It's my fault.

96
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:26,626
You just came home from the hospital,
and I'm making you do all these things.

97
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,372
That car.

98
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:48,641
Yeah.

99
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:51,744
It seems like it has been
following us for a while.

100
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,216
Yeah, why is it following us?

101
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,017
They're jealous of our cool truck, right?

102
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:59,319
Come on.

103
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,187
-What are you doing?
-Come on!

104
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,963
Fine. Come on!

105
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,101
Come on!

106
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,247
-Watch out!
-Watch out!

107
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:28,348
-That's okay.
-Faster.

108
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,482
Faster.

109
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,462
We finally got rid of it.

110
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,268
Before racing with us,

111
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,503
they should've asked
who sent this truck to us.

112
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,471
That's right.

113
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,491
This is not their day.

114
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:15,762
Get out!

115
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,030
Get out!

116
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,265
Get out!

117
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:20,566
-Get out!
-Stop.

118
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,168
Get out. Let's settle this.

119
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:43,990
What's wrong, Ah Xing?

120
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,166
Don't tell me you broke up with Yesha?

121
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:54,467
What?

122
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,039
Tell us.

123
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,708
This is not a guessing game.

124
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,476
Tell us already.

125
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,411
Speak up.

126
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,414
Both of you, turn your heads away.

127
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,250
Look straight ahead. Don't look at him.

128
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,489
No matter what the three of us will hear,

129
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,592
it has nothing to do with Ah Xing. Got it?

130
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:22,528
-Yeah.
-Okay.

131
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,807
I regained my memory.

132
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,182
I remember I told you this before.

133
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,919
I had a girlfriend who loved me so much.

134
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,790
I remember her now.

135
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,695
I remember I...

136
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:00,433
really love her.

137
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:02,535
But...

138
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:04,871
don't you love Yesha very much, too?

139
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:07,173
I love Yesha.

140
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:11,511
All this time, it's Yesha
who's there for me.

141
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,080
Without her...

142
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:17,116
there won't be me today.

143
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:22,288
But how could I know that God would pull
such a big prank on me.

144
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,725
I don't want to be unfaithful.

145
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,062
But I can't believe I told them both...

146
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,435
that I'll love them forever.

147
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:42,275
Does Yesha know this?

148
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,013
No one knows.

149
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,118
Before meeting you guys,

150
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:55,421
I didn't know who I should tell this to.

151
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:58,524
Ah Xing.

152
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:01,661
I don't want you to upset Yesha.

153
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,997
But your old girlfriend
has been waiting for you so long.

154
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:09,769
You should, at least, be honest with her.

155
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,104
And don't forget,

156
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:16,309
when Yesha was about to leave,
you stopped her.

157
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,311
She is your fiancée now.

158
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,380
It's your responsibility
to come clean to her.

159
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,285
No matter what,
you have to make things clear.

160
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,688
Yeah.

161
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:33,659
Just because God treats you unfairly,
you'll treat them unfairly, too.

162
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,829
What's the difference between
what you're doing and cheating on them?

163
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:39,232
I'm telling you, you should
talk things out with Yesha.

164
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,268
No, with his old girlfriend.

165
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,536
Talk with his old girlfriend?

166
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:45,771
-He was with his old one.
-He should talk to Yesha.

167
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,740
-No, he'll talk to Yesha.
-You know how upset Yesha--

168
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,742
He'll talk things out with neither.

169
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:51,544
-Why?
-Why?

170
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:54,580
You know nothing about girls.

171
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,684
When a girl deeply loves you,

172
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,120
she can't stand to watch you suffer.

173
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:04,657
When this girl knows
there's another girl who deeply loves you,

174
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:07,727
she will sacrifice herself
to make you happy.

175
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,030
So if you tell them this,
you will lose them both forever.

176
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,407
Ah Xing.

177
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:26,412
The pain is already there.

178
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:30,917
The only difference you can make

179
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:33,519
is to not have any regrets
with your decision.

180
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:42,461
Until you figure out who you truly love,

181
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,231
don't tell anyone.

182
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,302
I'm serious.

183
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,104
Don't tell anyone.

184
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,528
You said you would treat Ah Mei
and her friends to a meal.

185
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:17,830
You meant cooking by yourself?

186
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:21,000
Yeah, I think it's more genuine this way.

187
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:22,935
How so?

188
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,139
Every time it hits me
that I wrongly accused Ah De,

189
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,508
I feel so sorry for him.

190
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:32,211
So I want to cook something for them.

191
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:36,549
It can express my apology better
than buying a gift. Right?

192
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,591
Hey, kiddo, looking for vegetables?

193
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,960
I picked them myself this morning.

194
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:49,528
All freshly picked, very delicious.

195
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:50,863
Ma'am, did you grow this yourself?

196
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,532
Yeah, all by myself.
These are pesticide-free.

197
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,335
These are watered with river water.

198
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:58,304
They are very sweet and delicious
if you boil them.

199
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:00,339
-What's this?
-This is a turnip.

200
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:01,641
-This is a turnip.
-Turnip?

201
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,342
Turnip soup is very delicious.

202
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:06,078
-A vegetable for soup.
-Ma'am...

203
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,114
You, youngsters, should buy some of these.

204
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,817
I see you two are hanging out, wearing
nice clothes. What a life you have.

205
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,052
Thanks. You grew these yourself.

206
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,021
-You must be very healthy, right?
-I grew them myself.

207
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,823
I keep exercising and I do farming.

208
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,492
I would say I'm still going strong.

209
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,127
Young people like you should exercise.

210
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,528
-Got it.
-Exercise can do us good.

211
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:25,131
Ma'am, we'll exercise
by selling these for you. Okay?

212
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,434
Don't bother.
It will ruin your pretty clothes.

213
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,603
You two are hanging out.

214
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,238
If you sell vegetables for me,

215
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,006
you'll get your clothes dirty.
That would be bad.

216
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:35,941
Ma'am, that's fine. Give him a try.

217
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,677
Twenty bucks per catty.

218
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,813
This one, I'll sell this one to you
for only 20 bucks.

219
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,816
I will buy...

220
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:45,551
I grew these myself.
They're very delicious.

221
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:46,952
That will be 20.

222
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,422
All right, just charge her 20 bucks.

223
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:50,322
Thank you.

224
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,924
-I grew it myself. They're good.
-Thank you.

225
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:52,992
Thank you.

226
00:19:58,664 --> 00:19:59,498
What?

227
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,701
You didn't know the lady
would give you 100 bucks, right?

228
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:02,635
Yeah.

229
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:06,405
This is the first time I earned money
with my own hands.

230
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,442
Should we celebrate then?

231
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:10,943
Yeah.

232
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,878
-I'll buy some vegetables.
-Okay.

233
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:37,503
Hi.

234
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,405
I'll look around.

235
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,784
Excuse me, how much is this bunch?

236
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:54,019
-This bunch. That will be 100.
-Okay.

237
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,121
A hundred?

238
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,523
Here you go. A hundred.

239
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,492
-Thank you. No need to wrap it.
-Okay, thank you.

240
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:13,072
This is for you.

241
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:19,612
Thank you.

242
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,466
-Wow, that's great.
-Thank you.

243
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:41,667
The soup is coming.

244
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,537
Shancai, the dishes you cooked
look very pretty.

245
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,872
They look good, smell good,
and must taste good.

246
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:48,107
Let's eat.

247
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:49,275
Okay.

248
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,477
I've waited for so long that I'm starving.

249
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:52,711
Eat more vegetables.

250
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,714
-Yeah, it's so good.
-Yeah.

251
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:58,450
Our town is pretty small
and there's nothing fun to do.

252
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,986
There is a decent beach over there.
You can take a walk.

253
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,389
I often take a sunbath there.
It's amazing.

254
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:05,925
We don't have a specific place
in mind to go.

255
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,059
We don't have any plans.

256
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,028
We like how things are today.

257
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,364
Where did you go today?

258
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,701
Buy vegetables, cook.

259
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,303
And buy flowers.

260
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:18,971
That's it?

261
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:22,041
What about tomorrow? What will you do?

262
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:25,845
Nothing.

263
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,346
He's going to sleep.

264
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:31,684
Why are you so weird?

265
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:33,419
Just sleep?

266
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:36,322
Rich people really do have strange ideas.

267
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,591
How do you know he's rich?

268
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:40,059
Of course I know.

269
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,661
Is the car parked outside yours?

270
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:43,796
Yeah.

271
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:44,864
That's right.

272
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,166
Someone who can afford
that car must be very rich.

273
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:49,635
Why did you pay so much attention
to his car?

274
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,270
What scam are you planning this time?

275
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,240
We came in by the front door and we've
seen that car parked there several times.

276
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:56,642
Of course I know it's his car.
What scam are you talking about?

277
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,077
Want to go back to your old job, right?

278
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,445
What's wrong with you?

279
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:01,413
-Men know how much cars are.
-May I get you some soup?

280
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,482
-Weirdo.
-I bought these fresh clams today.

281
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,984
Yeah, the dishes are getting cold.

282
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,819
-Let's eat before chatting.
-Lunatic.

283
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,053
You're such a weirdo.

284
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,589
Ah Mei, how do we get to the beach?

285
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,024
The beach? That way.

286
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:14,193
I'll take you if you want to go there.

287
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,594
How long will it take by foot?

288
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:16,662
Not very long.

289
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:17,863
This bowl is for you.

290
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:41,253
Thanks.

291
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:44,623
Ah Mei.

292
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:47,059
You should trust Ah De more.

293
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,194
What do you mean?

294
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:54,566
Because one needs a lot of courage
and even more support to restart his life.

295
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,176
Shancai.

296
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:05,210
Yes?

297
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:15,054
Are you in a relationship with Lei?

298
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:17,589
What do you mean?

299
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:20,125
I think you two are very close.

300
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,995
I asked him, but he said no.

301
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:24,730
We are just friends.

302
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:26,265
Really?

303
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,600
I don't have a boyfriend.

304
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:32,004
And what I need now are friends,
not a boyfriend.

305
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:46,151
<i>The four of us were so happy tonight,</i>

306
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:50,589
<i>especially Ah De and I, who are trying
our best to have a fresh start.</i>

307
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:56,762
Thanks.

308
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,098
No problem. Be careful,
it's dark out there.

309
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:10,843
Let's go inside.

310
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,887
<i>This is a difficult path,
maybe a long one, too.</i>

311
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,089
<i>But I'm not afraid anymore,</i>

312
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:27,960
<i>because I received a very amazing gift.</i>

313
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,407
You haven't finished it yet?

314
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:44,376
This is your favorite.

315
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,378
You should have some more.

316
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,080
Really?

317
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,240
I accidentally drank all of it.

318
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:21,680
No wonder Sha said,

319
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:24,583
"If you keep being too good to me,
I'll get spoiled."

320
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,060
I think spoiling you...

321
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:40,299
is a kind of happiness.

322
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:48,807
I found tons of stuff in the house
while you were out buying coconuts.

323
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,343
Look.

324
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,448
There's more.

325
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:00,752
What are they used for?

326
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:04,089
For carving faces, of course.

327
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:06,091
Come on.

328
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:11,797
You carve one and I'll carve one, too.

329
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:30,816
What?

330
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:33,585
Come on.

331
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,892
You have to carve a cute one.

332
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:16,695
Need help?

333
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,131
I can manage, thank you.

334
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:24,636
Thank you.

335
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:28,340
Okay.

336
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,011
It's heavy.

337
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,858
Here, give me the wood.

338
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:53,865
Would you like something to drink?

339
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,267
No, thank you.

340
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,179
Lei, there are so many violins.

341
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:11,250
They're all handmade.

342
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:14,853
You mean they're all made by that man?

343
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:16,855
I suppose so.

344
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:20,259
I know there's only one luthier in Taiwan.

345
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:22,995
He studied music before.

346
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:29,067
He can't play violin anymore
because of a shoulder injury.

347
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:31,637
So he became a luthier.

348
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,807
Because he said...

349
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:39,044
he hopes he can create
more beautiful music.

350
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,447
Here, have some drinks.

351
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:43,649
Thank you.

352
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:46,251
So you already know my story.

353
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,453
Because he has taken violin lessons.

354
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,688
-Really?
-Yeah.

355
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:51,156
Be my guest.

356
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:52,257
Thank you.

357
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,593
Sir.

358
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,095
Could you show me that violin?

359
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:58,130
-This one?
-Yeah.

360
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,031
Sure.

361
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,602
Here.

362
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:08,073
In two days, I'll finish assembling it.

363
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:10,642
You can play it then, if you like.

364
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,681
Sir.

365
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:19,151
May I visit you with another friend?

366
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,452
Of course, you're always welcome.

367
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:36,435
Still no good?

368
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:38,570
Yeah.

369
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:42,040
There are not many cello players
in the first place.

370
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,410
Where did you buy your old cello?

371
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:46,878
I'll book a flight ticket.

372
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:48,747
We'll fly there tomorrow.

373
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,217
I don't believe we can't buy you one
you're satisfied with.

374
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:53,952
Meizuo.

375
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:57,456
Sometimes you need to rely on fate
to buy a cello.

376
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:59,358
It's not something you can rush.

377
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:02,561
You won't know if you don't try.

378
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:11,603
Hello, I'm busy now.

379
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:14,673
Lei?

380
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,944
We don't know an artist is living here.

381
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:58,683
Was I being a loudmouth?

382
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,227
We have that bottle
in our ice cream shop, too.

383
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:18,136
I can fix it.

384
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,772
But I need some time.

385
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:22,374
Great.

386
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:24,810
How long is "some time"?

387
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:28,346
I need materials.

388
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:30,949
If I can't find it within the country,

389
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:33,185
I have to look for them overseas.

390
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:37,155
Then will you be able to fix it
before her concert?

391
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:40,258
He said he needs some time. Stop asking.

392
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:44,629
Fine.

393
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,298
I don't have to be worried
since you're not.

394
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:53,972
Xiaociao, you know what?

395
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:56,942
I've never seen Meizuo
being worried like that.

396
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:19,097
What are you looking at?

397
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,465
I'm looking at the resin.

398
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:22,133
What's resin?

399
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:26,104
The material used for painting.

400
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:32,644
I've finished assembling that violin
you saw last time.

401
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:34,346
What a beautiful violin.

402
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:35,780
-Want to try it?
-Yeah.

403
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:57,869
A pretty good violin.

404
00:33:57,936 --> 00:33:58,904
Your turn.

405
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,071
You're so cute.

406
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:04,429
Are you okay?

407
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,335
Would you please hurry up, Ah Mei?

408
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:14,072
Say something!

409
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,042
What are you doing in there?

410
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:22,847
If you don't come out,

411
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,282
I'll do something about it.

412
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,252
You made me do this.

413
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:47,839
I hate it when people say I'm cute.

414
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:55,914
How could I be cute?

415
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:19,771
I wonder how long does it take to grow?

416
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:23,742
Maybe it will have grown
next time you and Meizuo visit here.

417
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:27,545
Who can predict something
that far into the future?

418
00:37:29,214 --> 00:37:31,216
So Meizuo and you have to try your best.

419
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:34,252
Shancai, let's make a deal.

420
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,488
The one you and Lei planted
has to try its best, too.

421
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:38,323
We'll come back here together.

422
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,425
Didn't Meizuo tell you?

423
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:42,861
Lei, Meizuo, and I are good friends.

424
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:44,963
No matter what happens,

425
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,631
as long as we water it correctly,

426
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:51,136
I believe one day,
they will grow stronger, won't they?

427
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:57,675
Meizuo.

428
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,278
When we get back,

429
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,747
don't tell people yet
that Shancai is here.

430
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:04,649
Why?

431
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:09,788
She needs more time.

432
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,859
Then you should make good use of the time.

433
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,128
What do you mean?

434
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:19,364
You know what I mean.

435
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:21,466
Shancai has been through a lot.

436
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:37,749
It's time to go.

437
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,818
Let me see you off.

438
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:51,196
Be careful on the road.

439
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:52,430
You, too, take care.

440
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:53,398
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

441
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:55,834
Get in.

442
00:39:10,315 --> 00:39:13,384
You two, take care of each other. Got it?

443
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:15,520
The same to you two.

444
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:20,058
Meizuo, Xiaociao is a nice girl.

445
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,161
Lei is pretty good, too.

446
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:25,964
I'm serious.

447
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:29,267
I'm serious too when I said,
"Lei is pretty good, too."

448
00:39:32,337 --> 00:39:33,538
But, Shancai,

449
00:39:34,072 --> 00:39:37,041
you should let the past stay in the past.

450
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,677
All of us hope you can
come back to us soon.

451
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,443
Let's go, Ah Mei.

452
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,645
Let's go to karaoke tonight.

453
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:15,213
-Yeah, let's go to karaoke.
-Yeah, karaoke.

454
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,115
-No.
-Or we can go see a movie?

455
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,416
Boring.

456
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:20,518
-Then...
-Hey.

457
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,153
Why are you so annoying today?

458
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:23,855
Ah De.

459
00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:25,723
Ah De just went out.

460
00:40:26,024 --> 00:40:27,258
-Where?
-I don't know.

461
00:40:27,325 --> 00:40:29,494
He said he has something
very important to do.

462
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,296
What kind of important things
does he have to do?

463
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:32,563
He's just being lazy.

464
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:35,099
He'd better not come back,
or I'll break his legs.

465
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,655
<i>Lei, Shancai.</i>

466
00:40:58,089 --> 00:40:59,390
<i>I want to ask you a favor.</i>

467
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,592
<i>Ah Mei's birthday is coming up.</i>

468
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,329
-Ah Mei's birthday is coming up?
-Yeah.

469
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:10,201
You both know that I've been gone
for many years.

470
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:12,570
Since my mom passed away,

471
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:15,273
there seems to be no one
who did anything for her on her birthday.

472
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:21,713
I'm not a good brother.

473
00:41:23,448 --> 00:41:25,216
I didn't take good care of her.

474
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:30,755
So I want to give her
a great birthday celebration this time.

475
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,390
I want to give her a surprise.

476
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:34,625
How do you want us to help you?

477
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:37,295
Ah De, shouldn't you wake up now?

478
00:41:39,364 --> 00:41:40,565
Ah De!

479
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,001
Get up!

480
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:45,837
Ah De.

481
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:48,906
Get up.

482
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:52,510
Shouldn't you get up now?

483
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:53,911
Shouldn't you get up now?

484
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:57,148
-Get up!
-What?

485
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,619
Still not waking up?

486
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,388
What happened?

487
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:05,423
Get up and prepare to open the shop.

488
00:42:08,493 --> 00:42:10,595
What time is it? You woke me up too early.

489
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:12,630
You'll prepare everything
all by yourself today.

490
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:13,898
So it's time to get up.

491
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:14,832
Me?

492
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:16,434
-By myself.
-What about you?

493
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,969
I got important things to do.

494
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:20,238
Don't go back to sleep.

495
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:24,842
What kind of important things
do you have to do?

496
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:11,823
What are you all doing
at our restaurant all day?

497
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,361
-Ah De.
-Yeah.

498
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,497
What is Ah Mei doing inside her room?

499
00:43:19,564 --> 00:43:21,466
Yeah. She's been there since this morning.

500
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:24,435
It's been so long.
What if something happened to her?

501
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:25,670
Nothing has happened.

502
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:28,172
-Why are you so sure?
-Yeah.

503
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,141
I was worried before too.

504
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:32,009
I knocked at her door.

505
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:33,878
She answered me with two words.

506
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:35,346
After hearing that, I was relieved.

507
00:43:35,413 --> 00:43:37,014
-What two words?
-What words?

508
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:41,886
Fuck off!

509
00:43:45,523 --> 00:43:46,757
I'm relieved now.

510
00:43:55,266 --> 00:43:56,634
What are you looking at?

511
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:06,377
Faster?

512
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:08,980
I can't.

513
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:15,086
Where are we going exactly?

514
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:16,654
Stop asking. Just go.

515
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:17,855
Yeah. Where are we going?

516
00:44:17,922 --> 00:44:19,690
My legs are going to snap.

517
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:20,725
Ride faster.

518
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,160
It's so far, Ah Mei.

519
00:44:23,461 --> 00:44:25,463
-Be careful.
-It's you who should be careful.

520
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,031
I nearly fell off.

521
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:29,534
I don't want to do this
in the first place.

522
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,535
Faster.

523
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:32,904
-Fine. I am riding faster.
-It's so far.

524
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:41,012
-What are you doing?
-It's not me.

525
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:43,214
It hurts.

526
00:44:43,281 --> 00:44:44,415
Are you okay?

527
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,985
-Are you okay?
-Just go.

528
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:50,621
-What are we doing here?
-Just move.

529
00:44:51,556 --> 00:44:53,558
-What is this place?
-Thank God I didn't fall.

530
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:56,394
Wait a minute.

531
00:44:58,162 --> 00:44:59,664
-Move faster, okay?
-I am.

532
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:01,832
This place is huge.

533
00:45:07,338 --> 00:45:08,573
Where's the doorbell?

534
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:21,819
Why are you here this early
in the morning?

535
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:25,056
Don't ask me. Ask her.

536
00:45:25,323 --> 00:45:26,357
Where's Lei?

537
00:45:26,691 --> 00:45:27,725
He's sleeping.

538
00:45:29,627 --> 00:45:31,095
Should I tell him you're looking for him?

539
00:45:31,629 --> 00:45:33,197
Ah Mei, I'll wake him up now.

540
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:38,202
Wake up.

541
00:45:40,004 --> 00:45:41,072
Wake up.

542
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:45,943
Wake up.

543
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:48,312
Wake up.

544
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:50,381
What are you doing?

545
00:45:50,648 --> 00:45:52,383
I have something to tell you. Get up.

546
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:55,886
Just tell me now, I'm listening.

547
00:45:56,954 --> 00:46:01,659
How can I tell you
such an important matter? Get up!

548
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:08,532
Just tell me already.

549
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:11,168
Fine, I'll start now.

550
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:12,470
Listen carefully.

551
00:46:13,638 --> 00:46:14,939
Are you awake?

552
00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:17,742
Are you going to say it or what?

553
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:19,343
Okay.

554
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:21,712
I hate beating around the bush,

555
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,547
so I'll cut to the chase.

556
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:24,849
I...

557
00:46:25,483 --> 00:46:27,184
decided to be your girlfriend.

558
00:47:27,478 --> 00:47:29,480
