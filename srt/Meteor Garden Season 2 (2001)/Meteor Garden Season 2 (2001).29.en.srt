1
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:40,861
Sha.

2
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:47,467
The hospital just called.

3
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,938
They said the bone marrow didn't match.

4
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,409
It didn't match!

5
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:17,464
DEATH

6
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:29,910
Get lost.

7
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:34,781
What are you doing?

8
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,685
Waiting for my death.

9
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:42,489
Didn't you promise me you would live
your life to the fullest?

10
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:47,961
I'm tired.

11
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:49,529
I give up.

12
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,233
What are you talking about?

13
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:59,206
Look at yourself.

14
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:00,407
Just look!

15
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,811
Where is the Yesha I know?

16
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,448
Are you still the Yesha who believes

17
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:11,017
that there's always a way out
when you're lost?

18
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,822
Are you still that Yesha
who always put a smile on people's faces?

19
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,124
Are you?

20
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,159
I'm the dying Yesha!

21
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:29,503
That's perfect because...

22
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,541
I'm the Daoming Si who almost died.

23
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,513
I'll tell you what death means.

24
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:46,286
Death means you are too late
to do what you want to do.

25
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,460
Death means you have no chance
to wipe away your tears.

26
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:59,499
Death means you don't even have
these three months.

27
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,739
So you're telling me that you would rather
give up these three months,

28
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,911
than live them to the fullest?

29
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,348
Tell me!

30
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:16,750
Tell me now!

31
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,953
Do you know how sad I am
seeing you like this?

32
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,290
Ah Si...

33
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:31,998
Why would they give me hope
then take it away?

34
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,802
I'm scared.

35
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:38,705
I'm so scared.

36
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:45,212
Don't be scared.

37
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:49,015
I'm here for you.

38
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:53,653
Let's travel around the world, okay?

39
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,926
We'll travel happily around the world.

40
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,599
We'll forget time,

41
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,501
all the troubles,

42
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,572
and everything that needs to be forgotten.

43
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:15,642
Okay?

44
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:29,789
I'll go traveling with Yesha.

45
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:35,295
A bit of relaxing will do you good.

46
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:37,497
When will you come back?

47
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:40,500
I don't know.

48
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:45,739
Yesha's illness...

49
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,208
I don't think she can handle long trips.

50
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:56,516
So you knew it all along.

51
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:00,320
That's why you made
that three-month deal with her, right?

52
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,898
Ah Si, I did that for your own good.

53
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,301
You love Yesha, don't you?

54
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,637
Then you shouldn't use our love
as leverage.

55
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,373
I am your son.

56
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,209
One day you'll understand

57
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,947
how much I'm doing for you.

58
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,717
I hope one day you'll understand
how selfish you are.

59
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,720
Young master, Madam.

60
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:35,322
Excuse me.

61
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,190
Liu Shuhao from the General Affairs
is on the line.

62
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,628
Why are you calling me so early
in the morning?

63
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,464
I see.

64
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:49,469
Shancai resigned.

65
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:52,505
Maybe she agreed to go to Japan
with Huaze Lei.

66
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,217
Two bottles.

67
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:18,224
We went to Hawaii to celebrate
Ah Si's tenth birthday, right?

68
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,627
I think it was the Disneyland
in Los Angeles.

69
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:21,728
It was Hawaii.

70
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:22,695
It was Los Angeles.

71
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,098
How is that possible?
I remember the beach was...

72
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,033
I celebrated my tenth birthday in Taiwan.

73
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,938
It was because I fell down
and broke my leg.

74
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,709
We thought you would never tell us.

75
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,319
Ah Si, it isn't what a friend would do.

76
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,722
You didn't tell us
you regained your memory.

77
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:58,665
I wanted to tell you.

78
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:02,735
I just didn't know how.

79
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:07,941
Do you remember Shancai?

80
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,196
Did you tell her?

81
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,509
I'll be traveling with Yesha
in a few days.

82
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,522
I don't know when I'll come back.

83
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:58,358
Let's say...

84
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,728
that this is our farewell.

85
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:05,632
Meizuo.

86
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,361
Lei will go back to Japan.

87
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,468
I guess the F4 is no more.

88
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:44,938
No.

89
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,574
There are things that can last forever.

90
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,745
Unless someone also loses their memory
in the future.

91
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,485
If I'm going to be that person, Ximen,

92
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,155
promise me that you'll beat me
until I regain my memory.

93
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,491
I promise. I've always wanted
to beat you up for a long time, anyway.

94
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,429
So much for my real friends.

95
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,333
You didn't beat me up
when I lost my memory.

96
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:27,614
Ah Si.

97
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:30,483
For Shancai, will you and Lei...

98
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,520
Have you already forgotten
what Ximen said?

99
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,325
The F4 will last forever.

100
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,041
<i>I didn't see Daoming Si and Yesha off
at the airport the day they left.</i>

101
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:05,184
<i>They've gone far away.</i>

102
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:10,790
<i>That summer ended
along with my most important memory.</i>

103
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,607
Hello, Aoyou Travel Agency.
How can I help you?

104
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,909
Sure. One moment, please.

105
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,612
Shancai, you have a call.

106
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:35,682
Thank you.

107
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,550
Excuse me, I have a call.
I'll leave you to it.

108
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:38,451
Okay, thank you.

109
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,888
Hello, this is Shancai.

110
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,793
I have good news for you too.

111
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,829
Yeah, I'll meet you there.

112
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:50,897
Bye-bye.

113
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,835
Sorry about that.
Have you made up your mind?

114
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:57,003
Yeah, it would be great.

115
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,844
<i>When winter came,
Shancai got a job at a travel agency.</i>

116
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:09,315
<i>She said it's a job
as close to happiness as it can be,</i>

117
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:14,187
<i>because who won't be happy
when starting a new journey?</i>

118
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:17,256
<i>Shancai is introducing tourists
to attractions</i>

119
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,658
<i>and booking flight tickets every day,</i>

120
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,394
<i>She said she loves the job so much.</i>

121
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:35,608
<i>She loves it when her clients
tell her stories from all over the world.</i>

122
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:41,981
<i>I think it's because she can get a picture</i>

123
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:45,618
<i>of how Daoming Si and Yesha are doing
even if she lost contact with them.</i>

124
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:47,620
<i>The winter break began.</i>

125
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,922
<i>Mimi got a part-time job
at the travel agency.</i>

126
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,330
Congratulations, Shancai.

127
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:59,098
For what?

128
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:00,166
The manager told me

129
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,034
that you'll be handling Japanese groups
next month.

130
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,503
You must be so happy.

131
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,538
Yeah, I am.

132
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:06,739
But I'm also nervous.

133
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,608
There's nothing to be nervous about.

134
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,244
After all, Huaze Lei has got your back.
He knows everything about Japan.

135
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:13,780
I don't know if he has the time.

136
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:17,150
I'm still nervous about the idea
of guiding a large group.

137
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:19,685
Surprise!

138
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:20,953
Qinghe.

139
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,021
Hello.

140
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,257
Shancai. Why aren't you surprised at all?

141
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,192
You come here every day.

142
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,460
Why would I be surprised?

143
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:29,328
Today's different.

144
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:30,797
It's a weekend today.

145
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,933
I made a plan for us to celebrate.

146
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,834
"Celebrate"?

147
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:35,735
Celebrate what?

148
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:37,603
We are celebrating...

149
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,173
you having a good day at work today.

150
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:42,975
We are celebrating...

151
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:45,511
because we haven't had fun
for a long time.

152
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:47,580
We are celebrating...

153
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:50,016
Anyway, we'll go dancing and stuff.

154
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:52,718
I want to dance until my legs cramp up.

155
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,653
Hurry up, will you?

156
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,855
Are you nuts?
Dance until your legs cramp up?

157
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:57,123
I really can't really go today.

158
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,090
I'm meeting Lei.

159
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,294
So much for being my friend.

160
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,863
I was so ready to dance.

161
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:06,332
What if you ask Lei to come along?

162
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,101
I'll pay to see him dance
until his legs cramp up.

163
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:12,505
Don't be silly.
You two go and have some fun.

164
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:18,377
Mimi, you can come, right?

165
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:23,149
Sorry, I have to work tonight.

166
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,817
More work?

167
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,253
What are you so busy these days?

168
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:29,655
You have work every time I ask you out.

169
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,626
Actually, I really want to go with you.

170
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:36,162
But Qinghe, the thing is,

171
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:38,931
my dad got me a job
at a fancy French restaurant

172
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,434
to help me with my dining etiquette, so...

173
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:44,103
I'm sorry, Qinghe.

174
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:47,773
Your dad doesn't think about how you feel.

175
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,275
It's winter break right now.

176
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,711
I'm sorry, Qinghe.

177
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,717
Qinghe, Mimi is working hard to improve
and make her family's life easier.

178
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,620
Didn't you said
you like hard-working girls?

179
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,890
That's true.

180
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,626
But, I think...

181
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:10,796
I think the winter break is so boring.

182
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:12,298
We'll go next time.

183
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,935
You should ask us out earlier next time,
so Mimi can rearrange her schedule, okay?

184
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:16,836
Yeah.

185
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:18,537
Qinghe, I'll go next time.

186
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,109
I should've gone burning incense
with my mom in Beigang.

187
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,690
Boring Taipei.

188
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:40,226
Bored Mr. Chen Qinghe.

189
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,428
Boring Friday.

190
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,104
Hello, I'm Qinghe.

191
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,540
Hi, Mimi.

192
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,310
It's all right.

193
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,979
Shancai said diligence is a virtue.

194
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:03,649
Okay, have a good day.

195
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:04,617
Bye-bye.

196
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:14,827
Daoming Si.

197
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:16,362
He's missing.

198
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,034
Ximen.

199
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,670
He's busy.

200
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:29,609
Meizuo.

201
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,513
Too busy with love.

202
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:41,187
Hello.

203
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:42,622
Ah Guai.

204
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,924
Let's go dancing tonight, okay?

205
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:47,660
Come on.

206
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:48,928
I won't bite.

207
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,797
It's on me.

208
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:13,252
Hey, you're so late.

209
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:16,656
Why are you so cute?

210
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,329
What's this?

211
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:25,898
-It's for you.
-For me?

212
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,001
-Let's go.
-Okay.

213
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,688
Hey, how is it?

214
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:53,426
How was it?

215
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,728
It's delicious.

216
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,732
Acai berries don't make you
cry anymore, right?

217
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:03,102
You know what? This needs to ferment
in a jar for three months.

218
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:05,204
It tastes better with condensed milk
and shaved ice.

219
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,239
Ah De invented it.

220
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,208
I call it...

221
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,711
"Ber-resh."

222
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,412
It's our signature dessert.

223
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,448
Shancai will love it.

224
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:19,018
Where's Shancai?

225
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,189
She'll join us later.

226
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,992
No, I mean how are things
between you and Shancai?

227
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,768
Same as always.

228
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:38,304
Which means?

229
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,039
We're friends.

230
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,478
What's wrong?

231
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,418
I didn't know you suck so much.

232
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,287
Aren't you going to take her to Japan?

233
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:58,524
She's no longer
with that bad-tempered guy, right?

234
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:02,194
Why don't you date her?

235
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:05,231
Why are you still friends?

236
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:09,902
Answer me.

237
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,605
You ask too much.

238
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,407
Then answer them one by one.

239
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:24,717
There's only one answer.

240
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:29,955
The story of Ah Si and Shancai
hasn't ended yet.

241
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,159
The story of you and Shancai
hasn't ended either, right?

242
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,631
Strictly speaking,

243
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:42,802
maybe our story...

244
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:47,473
hasn't even begun yet.

245
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:51,644
That makes no sense.

246
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:54,980
Don't you love Shancai?

247
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,420
Hey, don't lie to me
or you'll lose my respect.

248
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:09,094
I won't deny the fact
that I like Shancai very much.

249
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:19,171
I noticed ever since the moment I met her.

250
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:28,714
What are you doing?

251
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,185
<i>I had the desire to...</i>

252
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,020
Daoming Si!

253
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,156
<i>Break down her barriers,</i>

254
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:40,559
<i>and solve her problems.</i>

255
00:22:41,227 --> 00:22:44,129
Where are you?

256
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,799
<i>After Ah Si's accident...</i>

257
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,468
It doesn't matter
if we don't have to quit.

258
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:55,307
<i>I became the shoulder she could lean on.</i>

259
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,645
-When will you stop hating him?
-None of your business!

260
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:03,449
<i>But I didn't know,</i>

261
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,219
<i>that Shancai's tears...</i>

262
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:15,427
<i>made me love her more.</i>

263
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,434
<i>I still love Shancai...</i>

264
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,406
<i>I didn't even notice myself.</i>

265
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:32,544
<i>Without knowing the reason,</i>

266
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,551
<i>I kept feeling a pain in my heart.</i>

267
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:44,623
It hurts me more and more.

268
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:48,727
More and more.

269
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,632
After hearing what you said...

270
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,602
Shancai is the reason
you're in pain, right?

271
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,174
You love Shancai, right?

272
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,079
I finally realized my feelings
for Shancai.

273
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,221
I confessed my love to her.

274
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,624
Shancai.

275
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:24,630
Go to Japan with me.

276
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,932
I know she still loves Ah Si.

277
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:34,406
But for Shancai's sake,

278
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,348
I'm willing to be the shadow of Ah Si.

279
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,426
But I'm not Ah Si.

280
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:00,866
After all, Ah Si is like a brother to me.

281
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:04,937
Also,

282
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:09,975
when Ah Si regained his memories,

283
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:17,416
he was still in love with Shancai.

284
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:32,197
Then why does he never call?

285
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,902
Why does he leave Shancai alone?

286
00:25:40,406 --> 00:25:41,540
I think he knows the answer...

287
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,814
better than everyone else.

288
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,219
Ah Si disappeared...

289
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:03,095
to make sure

290
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,533
<i>that Shancai wouldn't get upset anymore.</i>

291
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:15,574
<i>But even without his presence,</i>

292
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,615
<i>the harder Shancai wants to forget,</i>

293
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:26,952
<i>the clearer she remembers.</i>

294
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,028
<i>Because in both of their hearts...</i>

295
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:43,869
<i>neither of them</i>

296
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:50,209
has seriously put an end to their story.

297
00:26:59,685 --> 00:27:01,353
I've booked my flight back to Japan.

298
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,458
I'll leave the day after tomorrow.

299
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,495
Don't you have any regrets?

300
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:11,530
In this world,

301
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:15,501
there are two kinds of regrets
that hurt the most.

302
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:22,207
The first is not being able
to be with someone you love.

303
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,350
The second is seeing
the one you love in pain.

304
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,755
I don't want you to suffer
from these regrets.

305
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:44,496
Hey.

306
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,335
I remembered you said
you don't like to cry.

307
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,972
It's because there's no shaved ice,

308
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:56,775
and no condensed milk, either.

309
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:00,712
It's all because of these acai berries.

310
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:17,095
Remember this.

311
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:21,700
When I save enough money,
I'll go to Japan and get you back.

312
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:24,436
I mean it.

313
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:33,312
You are...

314
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:36,048
so cute.

315
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,588
You're such a crybaby.

316
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:47,326
There, there.

317
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:50,762
You can have one acai berry.

318
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:52,431
No, you eat it.

319
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:54,366
It's delicious.

320
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:15,380
Qinghe, look.

321
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:17,482
They got a sideshow here?

322
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,218
Isn't that your schoolmate, Mimi?

323
00:30:20,786 --> 00:30:22,487
No, you must be mistaking her
with someone else.

324
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:24,022
Mimi is working, that can't be her.

325
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:25,624
Look closer, it really is her.

326
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,893
Look at her face. That is her.

327
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:30,329
You're mistaking her for someone else.
I told you, it's impossible.

328
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,998
Why are you mad at me? Why the long face?

329
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:34,866
Let's grab a beer.

330
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:41,473
-Come on--
-Sir, please stop.

331
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,408
Sir, please stop.

332
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:44,776
Sir, stop.

333
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,078
It's okay, come on.

334
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:46,978
Sir, please...

335
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:49,948
Leave her alone.

336
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:50,882
Who are you?

337
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:51,783
Qinghe.

338
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:54,386
Are you okay?

339
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:55,520
What are you doing?

340
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:58,490
Screw you.

341
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:01,226
I'll teach you a lesson!

342
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:03,161
No, please. I'm begging you.

343
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:05,230
-I'm begging you.
-I'll let you off the hook this time.

344
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:06,298
Don't let me see you again!

345
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:09,134
Qinghe.

346
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:11,303
Are you okay?

347
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:13,205
Go away.

348
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,223
Qinghe.

349
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:47,532
Why did you lie to me?

350
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:50,602
Why?

351
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:53,738
Tell me!

352
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:29,174
I'm sorry, Qinghe.

353
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,626
Shancai.

354
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:23,128
It's me, Qinghe.

355
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:26,965
I want to ask you a question.

356
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:33,004
If you found out that
your very good friend lied to you,

357
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:35,307
what would you do?

358
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:22,821
Qinghe, are your eyes okay?

359
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:33,198
Qinghe must look down on me now.

360
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:40,171
Because I'm a girl who lies a lot.

361
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,776
I'm such a shallow girl.

362
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:50,348
Mimi is such an ugly girl.

363
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:57,422
This is what you're thinking
right now, right?

364
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:01,993
No.

365
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:06,431
Actually, I think you are pretty cute.

366
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:11,503
I like how you keep following me around,
calling me Qinghe.

367
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:16,307
You would tell me everything
your father said.

368
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:21,846
Although I don't know
what your dad looks like,

369
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,417
judging from what you told me,

370
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:29,754
he must be a tall and strong man

371
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:32,057
who can knock me out with a single punch.

372
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,027
You're right.

373
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,063
This is what my dad looks like.

374
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:42,300
He's tall, and he's strong.

375
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:45,136
He can knock out the guys bullying me
with one single punch.

376
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:52,844
So, when I came here today,
I was scared of meeting him here.

377
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:04,823
Qinghe,

378
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:08,026
I didn't mean to lie to you.

379
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,765
I just wanted to make more money.

380
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:16,901
I just...

381
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:20,004
School is about to start.

382
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:26,644
It's fine. Just don't take
part-time jobs like that.

383
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:27,579
Don't get upset.

384
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:30,115
I'm not upset.

385
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:33,351
I'm so happy
that you're still talking to me.

386
00:37:43,528 --> 00:37:44,763
Shancai said,

387
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:47,799
"If a friend lies to you,

388
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,568
they must have a good reason."

389
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:55,406
So, I trust you.

390
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,778
Qinghe. You really trust me?

391
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:01,813
Of course.

392
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,381
You are my very good friend.

393
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:07,952
Thank you, Qinghe.

394
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:11,823
It's nothing. This is what friends do.

395
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:21,699
But it means a lot to me,

396
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:26,304
because I don't have friends.

397
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:30,842
Since childhood,

398
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:34,512
I had been the one everyone laughed at.

399
00:38:37,382 --> 00:38:40,051
I tried my best to get myself
accepted at Yingde.

400
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:46,591
Even if I couldn't afford the tuition,
I still wanted to study at Yingde,

401
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:53,364
because I wanted to make those people
who looked down on me admire me.

402
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,702
Then they would want to be my friends.

403
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:02,640
In my mind,

404
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:05,043
friendship is all about
costs and benefits.

405
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:07,879
If you're poor,

406
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,015
you will have no friends.

407
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:22,026
You're an illegitimate child,
so people won't respect you.

408
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:35,373
My father is not tall
and he is nowhere near strong.

409
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,345
He can't knock out the people bullying me,

410
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:45,516
because I don't have a father.

411
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:48,620
Because I'm an illegitimate child.

412
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:58,963
Qinghe. I didn't mean to lie to you.

413
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:02,567
I've always wished that

414
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:08,706
I have a father who hangs up on boys,

415
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:12,977
a father who opens my love letters
behind my back,

416
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:18,216
a father who is waiting for me
in front of the house at 10:00 p.m.

417
00:40:21,286 --> 00:40:24,856
I'm sorry.

418
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:29,427
Stop crying.

419
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,232
Stop crying.

420
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:37,135
That's okay if you don't have a father.

421
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:38,369
You have me, Qinghe.

422
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:43,808
I know,

423
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:48,112
I'm not tall and strong.

424
00:40:49,514 --> 00:40:51,816
But when someone bullies you,

425
00:40:52,884 --> 00:40:53,751
I can...

426
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:55,353
I can always take you to run away with me.

427
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:02,427
You don't need to lie anymore.

428
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:06,097
If someone bullies you,

429
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:07,031
you tell them,

430
00:41:07,098 --> 00:41:08,733
"Qinghe is the one protecting me."

431
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,702
Come on, repeat after me.

432
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:12,303
Mimi has Qinghe.

433
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:14,906
Mimi has...

434
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,641
Has who?

435
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:18,710
Has Qinghe.

436
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,778
Louder.

437
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:23,348
I have Qinghe!

438
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:24,615
Qinghe, protect me!

439
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:26,751
I have Qinghe!

440
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,119
Qinghe, protect me!

441
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:36,861
I have Qinghe!

442
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:38,429
Qinghe, protect me!

443
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,665
Louder.

444
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,600
I have Qinghe!

445
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,635
Qinghe, protect me!

446
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,412
Hi, sorry for keeping you waiting
for so long.

447
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:55,480
That's okay.

448
00:41:56,314 --> 00:41:58,249
-Are you sure you want to sit here?
-Yeah.

449
00:41:58,316 --> 00:42:00,318
Aren't you afraid of your ex-boyfriend
being mad at you?

450
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:31,649
I call that luthier every day.

451
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:33,651
I think he's about to go crazy.

452
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:38,256
Thank you.

453
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:42,827
You know,

454
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:44,629
this is something men should do.

455
00:43:07,552 --> 00:43:14,092
LOVES PEOPLE

456
00:43:14,659 --> 00:43:21,599
GOD LOVES PEOPLE

457
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:57,802
Tomorrow...

458
00:43:58,236 --> 00:43:59,403
I know.

459
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,538
We don't need to send you off.

460
00:44:09,614 --> 00:44:11,516
You are different from Ah Si.

461
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,452
He's bad at hiding secrets,

462
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,854
while you're great at it.

463
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:21,826
But both of you are my best friends.

464
00:44:25,196 --> 00:44:26,564
He left here.

465
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:29,033
You'll leave here, too.

466
00:44:31,202 --> 00:44:34,005
But I believe that one day,
both of you will come back here.

467
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,579
Not because how great Taipei is,

468
00:44:43,748 --> 00:44:45,249
but because Taipei is our home.

469
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,287
Everyone will come back home one day.

470
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:56,093
When you come back, can I pick you up?

471
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:01,899
Tell Meizuo this for me.

472
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,769
He's in love these days
and he's occupied with it.

473
00:45:09,507 --> 00:45:11,809
No matter how occupied I am,
I have to have a drink with you.

474
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:25,489
Tomorrow...

475
00:45:26,324 --> 00:45:27,358
I know.

476
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:30,027
No need to send you off.

477
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:49,247
<i>There's a snail going back to Japan.</i>

478
00:45:50,448 --> 00:45:51,949
<i>I haven't known, until now,</i>

479
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:54,819
<i>that I'm a snail, too.</i>

480
00:45:57,221 --> 00:46:01,559
<i>I'm fated to be friends
with another snail forever.</i>

481
00:46:03,027 --> 00:46:04,061
<i>Now I know,</i>

482
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:07,832
<i>there's one thing
that I could never give you.</i>

483
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:10,668
<i>It's your happiness.</i>

484
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:37,588
