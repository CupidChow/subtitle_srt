1
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:04,625
<i>Our family is so lovely</i>

2
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:08,862
<i>Tidy, happy, and healthy</i>

3
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:12,733
<i>The siblings get along well</i>

4
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:17,237
<i>And our parents are so kind</i>

5
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:21,908
<i>Even if the parents are no good</i>

6
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:26,179
<i>The daughter is very pretty</i>

7
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,382
<i>Summer has come.</i>

8
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,317
<i>Dad finally found a job selling cars.</i>

9
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:32,386
<i>He and Mom moved back to Taipei
from the fishing village.</i>

10
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,388
<i>Our family can finally be together.</i>

11
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,524
<i>I think the good times are coming.</i>

12
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:40,360
Daoming Si and I haven't even argued
for two months already.

13
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:41,928
Shancai!

14
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,363
All right. Come on.

15
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,431
Are you all right?

16
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,332
I'm good.

17
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:46,233
I'm so happy!

18
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:47,534
-I'm too scared to jump.
-Careful...

19
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:49,603
-I'm scared.
-It's all right.

20
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,274
You're so heavy.

21
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,409
You gained weight again.

22
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:58,812
-Mom.
-Shancai!

23
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,681
-Shancai!
-Mom.

24
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:01,948
It's my fault.

25
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:04,918
You both suffered because of me.

26
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:08,922
But don't worry,
from now on, I'll work harder,

27
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,224
so that we can live comfortably.

28
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:12,526
Dad.

29
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,362
Let's move the things inside.

30
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:16,596
No need.

31
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,899
Shancai, let your father do it.

32
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,536
Aren't you supposed to go to school today?

33
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:24,571
That's right, Shancai.

34
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:27,007
Leave it to me.

35
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:28,341
Your mom can also help move them.

36
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,110
She's gotten so fat lately.

37
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:31,912
It's a good opportunity for her
to lose weight.

38
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:38,018
Isn't today the graduation day
of our beloved son-in-law, Ah Si?

39
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,787
How do you know about that?

40
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:43,390
And, please,
don't make things complicated, okay?

41
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:44,758
What son-in-law?

42
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,626
What's the big deal
about their graduation, anyway?

43
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,862
If it's considered a big deal,
it's because Yingde University

44
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:50,664
-can finally be free from them...
-Stop!

45
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,800
Go to school now!

46
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,469
Okay, I'll...

47
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,538
Not you, idiot!

48
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:05,445
<i>That's right. The good times
are really coming.</i>

49
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:07,681
<i>After Daoming Si
and those morons graduate,</i>

50
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,150
<i>the good days of Yingde University
will finally arrive.</i>

51
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:58,765
It's the time when royal poincianas
are at bloom again.

52
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:04,538
I believe that all of you students
are sad to part ways.

53
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:10,343
Today is the graduation day
of Yingde University.

54
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:12,412
And I, as your principal,

55
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,414
have a few words of encouragement
for everyone.

56
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,818
When you become part of the workforce,

57
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:22,255
you must pay special attention
to the way you deal with people.

58
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:25,158
Don't fail to do acts of kindness
just because they are small in scale.

59
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:28,094
Don't commit evil acts
just because they are not big in scale.

60
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:32,265
Whatever you do will leave a trace.

61
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,601
They say that every step leaves a mark.

62
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:36,503
Shancai.

63
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,104
The graduation ceremony
has already started.

64
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,773
Will the F4 be attending?

65
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,974
How would I know?

66
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:44,811
You should spend time reading books...

67
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:52,185
...because books are a source
of knowledge.

68
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:55,121
You should spend time...

69
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:57,424
Boldly go forward...

70
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,863
At this time every year,

71
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:07,701
I, as your principal,
feel a surge of pride.

72
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:15,709
F4
DON'T GO

73
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,424
Educators should be like me,

74
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,527
I always keep my words short

75
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:38,265
and I always work very seriously
and devotedly.

76
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:41,568
They should have a fair
and just, righteous,

77
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:45,171
and impartial attitude like me.

78
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,608
And I don't brag about these things.

79
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,615
I will welcome you with open arms

80
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:59,419
if you pay a visit
to the university anytime.

81
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:39,392
They're here.

82
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,740
The F4 are the F4 indeed.

83
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,508
They always stand out
even on graduation day.

84
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:57,677
What's so special about them?

85
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:58,778
How childish.

86
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:11,758
The royal poincianas
are in bloom once again,

87
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:17,797
and in this season of royal poincianas,
parting ways does not signify the end.

88
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,333
Instead, it is a new beginning.

89
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,868
Therefore, I...

90
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:23,136
I...

91
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,304
I...

92
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:27,374
Where's my diploma?

93
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:29,776
Then...

94
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:35,248
Okay, we shall give the diplomas now
with Daoming Si as your representative.

95
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,223
He's so cool.

96
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:52,632
Receiving the diploma signifies the start
of a new phase in your life.

97
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:57,937
You should all remember
what I said earlier.

98
00:08:58,738 --> 00:08:59,773
We...

99
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:05,205
<i>Just like that,</i>

100
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,007
<i>what should have been an emotional
graduation ceremony</i>

101
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:12,178
<i>ended with the chaos created
by the F4 and their helicopters.</i>

102
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,781
<i>That's how the F4 left.</i>

103
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:18,051
<i>Perhaps Yingde University will be
more peaceful from now on.</i>

104
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,660
The F4 are so cool.

105
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,762
They showered flower petals
from the helicopter.

106
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,064
They're really cool.

107
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,067
That reminds me,
I should get their autograph.

108
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:34,968
Qinghe.

109
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,470
F4, you're all so handsome.

110
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:39,973
F4, we love you!

111
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:43,443
<i>While Yingde will be
much more peaceful now,</i>

112
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,746
<i>I think that a lot of laughter
would also be gone without the F4.</i>

113
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,292
Everyone.

114
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,061
The F4 will pay for your bill tonight.

115
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,370
Hey, enough.

116
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:12,438
It's Lei's turn.

117
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,575
-Hey, knock it off!
-What are you saying?

118
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:18,077
Look at you two. Your faces are so red.

119
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:20,880
Hurry up. Get a map

120
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,617
It's game time!

121
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,785
-Come on.
-What kind of game?

122
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:29,289
Come.

123
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,225
What is this?

124
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,460
Help us decide on our graduation trip.

125
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,297
-Do we decide by throwing darts?
-Whatever.

126
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,365
We have already been
to a lot of places already.

127
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,034
That's right. Hurry.

128
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,468
Why do you decide so recklessly?

129
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,903
That's how we've always done it.

130
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:45,672
Where do you want to go then?

131
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,707
How about going to Kending?

132
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:48,942
Kending?

133
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,911
You're so lame.

134
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:52,879
That's true.

135
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,783
-Enough. Let me do it.
-All right.

136
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,017
-Enough. Let me do it.
-All right.

137
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:58,952
-Let's do it.
-Get ready.

138
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,056
Here comes my dart.

139
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,293
I wasn't finished setting it up
but you threw the dart already.

140
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,194
What if you hit me?

141
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:09,229
How would I hit you?

142
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,496
I aimed it here.

143
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,632
Okay? It's Spain then.

144
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:14,467
I've gone to Spain already.

145
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:15,902
Can you speak Spanish?

146
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:19,706
It's all set then.

147
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,474
Shancai, give us your passport tomorrow.

148
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,244
-Why?
-You're coming on our graduation trip.

149
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:26,179
-Spain?
-Yeah.

150
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,180
I don't have money.

151
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:28,181
Are you stupid?

152
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,016
I'll pay for it, of course.

153
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:31,451
Who wants your money?

154
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:32,719
What did you say?

155
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,320
Just think of it as borrowing from Ah Si.

156
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,155
You can always pay him back later.

157
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,224
Borrowing?

158
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,592
This is borrowing?

159
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,262
Then we all agree that it's borrowing.
You heard it.

160
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:43,529
-I heard you.
-Lei, you heard it.

161
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,631
This is just borrowing.

162
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,532
I'll pay you back from my part-time job.

163
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,234
You're such a...

164
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:51,137
Never mind. Forget it.

165
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:52,839
Just withdraw the money for me tomorrow.

166
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,708
Are we really going to Spain?

167
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:56,943
Nonsense.

168
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,711
I'm going to Spain!

169
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,782
What does Spain look like?

170
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,498
Why are you so late?

171
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:19,732
Are we?

172
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,434
Give me your passports first.
I'll check us in.

173
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,245
Shancai.

174
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,246
Where's your passport?

175
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,016
How can this happen?

176
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,117
What's the matter?

177
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:43,456
I...

178
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:46,192
I think I forgot my passport.

179
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:47,093
What?

180
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,864
Shancai.

181
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,232
Don't panic, just keep looking.

182
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,904
You're so stupid!

183
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:00,006
Haven't you gone overseas before?

184
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:01,974
You think you can go without a passport?

185
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,476
I didn't mean to do it.

186
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:05,645
If you don't want to go, then don't.

187
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,046
You don't have to pretend.

188
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:08,247
Are you crazy?

189
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,582
Why would I do that?

190
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,023
GO home and get your passport for me.

191
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,194
Why should I go home
and get my passport "for you"?

192
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,228
I just won't go, all right?

193
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,196
You...

194
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,798
Enough. Stop arguing already.

195
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,834
Worse comes to worst,
we can still take the next flight.

196
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,436
No need, just enjoy your trip without me.

197
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,171
Shancai.

198
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,439
Shancai.

199
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,541
Shancai, I'm here.

200
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,310
Qinghe, Mom.

201
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:38,978
-Hello to you, masters.
-Mom.

202
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,146
Shancai.

203
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,647
Good thing we caught up with you.

204
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,449
Will you still be able to make the flight?

205
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:47,720
How can you leave your passport
on the table at home?

206
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:49,822
Good thing we went here.

207
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,826
I'm good at finding what you need
when you need it.

208
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:58,431
Good thing Master Qinghe's car
is really fast.

209
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:00,466
I came over as soon as Mrs. Dong called.

210
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:01,868
Shancai.

211
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,971
I told you,

212
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:08,040
I will always be here for you
if you need anything.

213
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,109
I also brought my passport.

214
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:13,079
I'll also buy a ticket later
and go with you.

215
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,480
I'll take care of you during the trip.

216
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,452
Hey, you nouveau riche.

217
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,920
-What?
-Thanks for bringing the passport.

218
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,755
But you don't have any business
being here anymore.

219
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:24,056
Thank you, Qinghe.

220
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,425
But I won't go anymore.

221
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,226
She's not going...

222
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:30,463
Shancai.

223
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,598
Weren't you excited to go on this trip?

224
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,234
How come you don't want to anymore?

225
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,871
We have the passport now.

226
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,441
But, I think,

227
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,076
if someone would be willing to apologize,

228
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,712
then we can put this matter to an end.

229
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:55,788
Why should I apologize?

230
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,391
Yes, why would Daoming Si
need to apologize?

231
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:06,499
In that case, Ximen, go check us in first.

232
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,901
I'll check us in then.`

233
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,504
Qinghe.

234
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:15,908
Please bring Shancai and Mrs. Dong home.

235
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:16,909
All right.

236
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:17,810
-Let's go, Mom.
-No.

237
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:18,811
-Let me help.
-Thanks.

238
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:19,979
-Shancai!
-What?

239
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,981
-Let's go, Mrs. Dong.
-What's going on?

240
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:23,216
Let's go home.

241
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:24,784
Okay, fine. I'm sorry.

242
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:34,994
It seems like I heard somebody apologize.

243
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,303
Actually, I was at fault too.

244
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,243
Apologizing is more effective
than calling the police indeed.

245
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,499
Master Ah Si.

246
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:22,508
I got this especially for you two
from the Longshan Temple.

247
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,610
Here.

248
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:25,945
Wear this around your neck.

249
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:27,847
-Do I have to wear this?
-Yes.

250
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:30,850
This is for your safety.

251
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,718
We should go.

252
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,253
Mom, we're going then.

253
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,688
-Bye.
-Bye.

254
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:36,856
Bye, Qinghe. Thank you.

255
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,760
Master Ah Si.

256
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:46,966
Master Ah Si.

257
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,969
Please take care of my daughter.

258
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:57,343
Mom, I'm only going away for a few days.

259
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,211
Don't be too dramatic.

260
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,785
I hope you have a safe trip.

261
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:06,819
Okay?

262
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:08,754
Bye, Mom.

263
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:09,889
Bye, Qinghe.

264
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:12,758
Please take good care of Shancai.

265
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:24,737
What are you doing?

266
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:25,771
Let's go.

267
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,708
Since this is your honeymoon,
we won't be your third wheels.

268
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:30,843
-What?
-What?

269
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:33,879
The thing is,

270
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,016
seeing you immature lovers
so lovely-dovey during the trip

271
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,417
would make me vomit.

272
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:42,188
Shancai, if the F3's not going with you,
I'll go with you...

273
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,160
Ah Si.

274
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:50,596
This is for you.

275
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:54,533
What's this?

276
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,868
Just open it when you reach Spain.

277
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:57,303
Why are you being so mysterious?

278
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,240
All right.

279
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,508
Aren't you going yet?

280
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,144
Have a safe trip.

281
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,333
Daoming Si, hurry.

282
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,772
I think I'm going to faint.

283
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,774
Is this for real?

284
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,677
Is this really the Sagrada Familia?

285
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:41,013
This is really the best church in Spain!

286
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,350
Are you really that moved?

287
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,852
Oh, god, Daoming Si! Look!

288
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,589
This is the work
of the architectural genius, Gaudi!

289
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:53,926
I know.

290
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:55,795
Can you not make a big fuss over it?

291
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,163
It's so lame.

292
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,134
It's the Sagrada Familia.

293
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,103
Gaudi is such a genius!

294
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:06,706
Are you stupid?

295
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,941
They say he had mental problems

296
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:11,477
because he had rheumatism when
he was little and had difficulty moving.

297
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,713
That's why he can only think
about nonsensical things at home.

298
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:16,215
Don't you think his designs
are very strange?

299
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:18,751
They're all weird designs
with no direct angles.

300
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:21,620
You're just jealous.
That's what geniuses are.

301
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,723
There's only a thin line
between a genius and an idiot.

302
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,659
But based on your IQ,
you can't see genius, of course.

303
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,294
You can only see idiots.

304
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,795
I can only see an idiot?

305
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:34,800
That's right.

306
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,470
There are so many
beautiful women in the world,

307
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:39,972
how come I only see...

308
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:42,508
the idiot staring blankly
with her head raised?

309
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:53,819
Hey, dork.

310
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:55,321
Do you want to take a look inside?

311
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:56,956
No.

312
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,457
Unless you carry me on your back.

313
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:00,926
Carry you?

314
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,095
You wish.

315
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:04,797
Why are you like that?

316
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:06,665
Just carry me for a while.

317
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,234
You're no fun.

318
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,302
Then you carry me.

319
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:11,303
Okay, I'll carry you.

320
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:04,657
Barcelona is really so beautiful.

321
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,327
Are you happy?

322
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,730
I am not only happy. I'm very happy.

323
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:15,835
You know...

324
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,338
before I met you,

325
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:22,308
I didn't know what happiness was.

326
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:33,586
Hold my hand so you don't get lost.

327
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:02,181
Are we going to sleep in the same room?

328
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:06,819
What are you nervous about?

329
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:08,721
I'm still the same as before.

330
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,227
<i>I'm a man, of course.</i>

331
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:16,896
I would be lying
if I said I'm not impatient.

332
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,097
But...

333
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:19,798
Just go to bed.

334
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,637
Or you can sleep on the bed
and I'll sleep on the sofa?

335
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:26,138
The sofa?

336
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:28,908
How can I let the girl I love
sleep on the sofa?

337
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:30,576
<i>Can you please go to bed?</i>

338
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,886
-Aren't you going to sleep yet?
-I...

339
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,322
I think it's the time difference.

340
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:53,325
And the view here in Barcelona
is so beautiful at night.

341
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:54,526
So how can I sleep?

342
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:56,088
Good night.

343
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:00,659
Good night, Daoming Si.

344
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:32,791
Wake up!

345
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,994
Wake up! Stop sleeping!

346
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:38,363
Let's go sightseeing!

347
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,466
I still have jetlag.

348
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,468
-Let me sleep some more.
-Stop sleeping.

349
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,870
-I don't care, wake up!
-Just a little more.

350
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,171
I don't care!

351
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,007
You want me to get out of bed, right?

352
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,009
Then let me hug you first.

353
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,879
Knock it off!

354
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:50,102
How are they?

355
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:01,313
That's so funny.

356
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,937
ANTIGUA CASA FIGUERAS

357
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:29,474
Look, Daoming Si.

358
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:31,443
What is it?

359
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:07,813
You're so mean.

360
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:10,882
This way, I'll owe you a strawberry.

361
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:13,685
Remember to pay me back.

362
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:15,721
Don't worry.

363
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:17,389
I'll use my whole life to pay you back.

364
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,389
Look, it's the Canaletes Fountain!

365
00:29:59,698 --> 00:30:01,867
-Have a sip.
-No, it's dirty.

366
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:03,969
-No, it's refreshing. Have a sip.
-I'm not thirsty.

367
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:05,570
Why are you forcing me to drink it?

368
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:08,006
That book says if you drink
water from the fountain,

369
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:09,875
you'll surely return to Barcelona.

370
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:10,909
I drank it earlier.

371
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,478
Don't drink it.
Who wants to come with you again anyway?

372
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:19,177
Look.

373
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,813
What's so nice about it?

374
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,682
It's a mushroom. It's so cute.

375
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:30,055
It's so ugly.

376
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,060
Look, they sell these in Taiwan too.

377
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:39,698
It's so heavy.

378
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,134
Do you want it?

379
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:43,902
I don't want this.

380
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:01,286
Hello.

381
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:03,221
Miss, do you want to buy anything?

382
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,490
Do you like this? It's beautiful.

383
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:08,660
This alabaster sculpture makes good decor.

384
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:10,328
It's meticulously sculpted.

385
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:28,447
Look. This meteor ring is so nice.

386
00:32:29,848 --> 00:32:31,550
It's all right, nothing special.

387
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,252
But it's nice.

388
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,691
Do you like it? I'll buy it for you.

389
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,160
No.

390
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:47,833
Why don't you want to buy
something that you like?

391
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,469
Because... rings are not
to be given randomly.

392
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:51,803
Let's go.

393
00:33:08,787 --> 00:33:09,821
One balloon, please.

394
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,389
All right.

395
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,225
Thank you.

396
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:17,796
Miss Shancai.

397
00:33:17,863 --> 00:33:19,664
I'm giving you my happiness.

398
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,275
That's all right, I'll go buy another one.

399
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,377
There's no need, Daoming Si.

400
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:37,642
Hey, Sir. You...

401
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:34,633
Shancai!

402
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:36,801
Shancai!

403
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:31,089
Shancai.

404
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:33,758
I'm sorry.

405
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:34,993
It's fine.

406
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:49,708
Shancai!

407
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:54,379
Daoming Si!

408
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:03,221
I'm sorry.

409
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:04,789
I thought I lost you.

410
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:06,491
You scared me to death.

411
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:09,928
I promise you, it won't happen again.

412
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:11,429
I guarantee you, it won't happen again.

413
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:17,802
Promise me.

414
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:21,740
If you get lost, just stay where you are.

415
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:23,875
I'll always come back for you, okay?

416
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:26,611
Daoming Si.

417
00:37:26,678 --> 00:37:30,682
Earlier, I was thinking,
what would I do if I couldn't find you?

418
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:34,819
Silly girl.

419
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:37,155
You won't ever lose me.

420
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:38,256
Never.

421
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:17,896
TO XIMEN, MEIZUO, LEI

422
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:19,017
AH SI

423
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,261
Daoming Si.

424
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:18,276
<i>Get dressed quickly.</i>

425
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:21,012
<i>I've arranged
for the hotel driver already.</i>

426
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:22,613
<i>He'll wait for you downstairs.</i>

427
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:24,849
<i>He knows where to find me.</i>

428
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:29,220
Who does that?

429
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:31,356
Leaving me alone
and having fun by himself.

430
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:33,057
He's so mean.

431
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:55,733
Please get off here, miss.

432
00:43:58,936 --> 00:43:59,770
This is the place?

433
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:02,106
Over there?

434
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:30,835
Hello?

435
00:44:30,902 --> 00:44:32,703
<i>Shancai, are you there already?</i>

436
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,105
Yes, I'm here.

437
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:35,540
All right. I'll be there soon.

438
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:36,741
All right, bye.

439
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,384
