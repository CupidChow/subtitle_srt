1
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,729
Shancai.

2
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:10,564
Shancai.

3
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:13,834
-Let me help you with your bag.
-There's no need. Thanks.

4
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,836
-It's fine. Let me help you.
-There's no need, Qinghe.

5
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,504
Why did you ask me to come out
so suddenly?

6
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:20,240
I couldn't remember where I put
my swimsuit from last year.

7
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,742
I can only borrow my mom's.

8
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,011
Shancai. Didn't go swimming
the entire summer?

9
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:25,345
-Yes.
-Obviously.

10
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,547
She's been looking for
Daoming Si's memory the entire summer.

11
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:28,815
How would she have time to swim?

12
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:30,951
That's right.

13
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:32,419
Summer is almost over,

14
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,187
so we have to catch
the last few days of summer.

15
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:35,255
-Yes.
-That's right.

16
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,624
We have to make up
for the entire summer today.

17
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,326
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

18
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,109
Why isn't Shancai here yet?

19
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:59,112
If I were her, I wouldn't come.

20
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,148
Why?

21
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,918
I'm asking you. Why?

22
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,453
Daoming Si.

23
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,857
Nouveau riche, why are you here?

24
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:13,427
We're all friends.
Why can't we all go out together?

25
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:19,700
Hi, Shancai.

26
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,068
Hi.

27
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,904
-Hi, Daoming Si.
-Hi, Daoming Si.

28
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,539
Hi, Princess Yesha.

29
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:26,773
Hi, Princess Yesha.

30
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,175
Haven't we greeted each other enough?

31
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:33,280
I'm going inside first.

32
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:50,564
That's just how he is. He feels awkward
when there are lots of people.

33
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,531
I know.

34
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,233
That's right. You know.

35
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,235
-Let's just have a good time.
-Yes.

36
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:59,773
It's up to us now.

37
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,475
Yes, Qinghe.

38
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:32,405
Daoming Si.

39
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:33,774
What?

40
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:35,942
It's been a while
since we've been out together.

41
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:37,644
Do you feel anything special?

42
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,549
It feels familiar, right?

43
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,285
It feels familiar. Am I right?

44
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,288
You know,

45
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:52,959
there's a story behind you, me,
and this swimming pool.

46
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:04,204
First, you have to imagine that this

47
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,240
is a luxurious yacht.

48
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:11,211
There's only us F5, Shancai,

49
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:12,946
and other Yingde classmates.

50
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,415
We dance and eat seafood daily.

51
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,117
We're having so much fun.

52
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,552
Until one night...

53
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,053
Are you done?

54
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:21,321
Are you mad?

55
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:23,089
You're right to be mad.

56
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,358
You can kick me into the water. Come on.

57
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,127
Are you this troublesome ever since?

58
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:29,396
Yes, you can kick me
into the water. Please.

59
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,437
Daoming Si.

60
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,872
Wait for me. I'll race you.

61
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,240
The one who loses is a dog.

62
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,979
Qinghe, you can do it.

63
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,459
Why don't you go swimming?

64
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:00,827
Why don't you go swimming?

65
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:03,129
I can't swim.

66
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:05,565
The view is nice here,

67
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:07,133
so I came out for some air.

68
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,935
Yes, me, too.

69
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:17,310
What happened between you and Ah Si?

70
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:19,980
Nothing.

71
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,453
I'm giving you this phone back.

72
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:39,766
Did it cause you any trouble?

73
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:42,469
No.

74
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:45,572
Actually, it's me.

75
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,477
I've decided to give up.

76
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:52,445
Shancai.

77
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,484
-Qinghe.
-I can't do it anymore.

78
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,086
Don't tell me.

79
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,587
I let Daoming Si win again.

80
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:09,889
No, Qinghe, you reached the edge first.

81
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,558
You won big-time.

82
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:12,492
What?

83
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,494
-Did I win?
-Yes.

84
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:15,662
How is that possible?

85
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,299
Yes! I, Chen Qinghe, won.

86
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:20,767
Daoming Si finally lost.

87
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:23,436
-Yes!
-Qinghe, you're so great.

88
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,505
Mimi.

89
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:27,741
You don't have
to blindly admire me so much.

90
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:30,010
Though I know
my swimming skills are great,

91
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,246
it's Daoming Si that's too lousy.

92
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:35,248
Where's Daoming Si?

93
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,017
Where's Daoming Si?

94
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,652
It seemed that Daoming Si drowned.

95
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,321
Help!

96
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:44,791
I was even thinking

97
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,594
that Daoming Si might have gained
his memory back.

98
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:50,997
However, he realized
that you're the one he loves.

99
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:53,733
So he'd rather not have his past.

100
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,904
If that's really the case,

101
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,306
then, to him, isn't my persistence

102
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,242
too selfish?

103
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:04,844
That's why I should give up.

104
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,648
You can't give up.

105
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,253
You're not someone who just gives up.

106
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:17,390
Yesha.

107
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:19,392
I'm really tired.

108
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,227
I don't have any strength anymore.

109
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,665
Just hold on a little more.

110
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,802
If you're not beside him,

111
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,670
when I leave...

112
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,473
Help!

113
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,276
Daoming Si, he...

114
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,278
He...

115
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,520
Ah Xing.

116
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,888
Daoming Si.

117
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:50,690
Daoming Si.

118
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,317
Qinghe, will Daoming Si die?

119
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:18,885
Stop talking nonsense.

120
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:24,691
Ah Xing, wake up.

121
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,793
I don't want to see you this way.

122
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:27,861
Ah Xing.

123
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,222
Daoming Si.

124
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:58,424
-Daoming Si.
-Ah Xing.

125
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,061
Ah Xing.

126
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:03,630
Daoming Si.

127
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,499
Daoming Si.

128
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,701
Ah Xing.

129
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,771
SURGERY ONGOING

130
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,160
It turns out that life is so fragile.

131
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:38,097
Ah Xing is so fragile, too.

132
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,404
Maybe I'm not the one leaving.

133
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:49,709
Maybe he'll leave first.

134
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:58,718
Life can be gone in just
a blink of an eye.

135
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,455
Same goes for Ah Xing.

136
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,925
He might be gone in a blink of an eye.

137
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,494
He won't.

138
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:10,430
You know,

139
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:12,732
Daoming Si's body is amazing.

140
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:15,602
His ability to recover
is like that of a dog.

141
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,104
When I mentioned
that he's like a dog before,

142
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:19,872
F3 laughed so hard.

143
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,508
Daoming Si was so furious.

144
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,845
But he's really like a dog.

145
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:27,747
He'll recover soon.

146
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,616
So don't worry.

147
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:31,317
Just focus on praying for him.

148
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,164
Let's pray together.

149
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,399
Okay.

150
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:51,871
God.

151
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,275
Please give me one more chance.

152
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,278
Please also give Ah Xing one more chance.

153
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,190
Where is Ah Si?

154
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,265
He's still being operated on.

155
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,407
Was this your idea?

156
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,811
How many times do you have to endanger
Ah Si before you're satisfied?

157
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,681
This was my idea, not Shancai's.

158
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:36,549
Please don't cause her any trouble.

159
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,353
You colluded so many times
to force Ah Si to do what you want.

160
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:43,356
Can't you see he's had enough?

161
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,359
Dong Shancai.

162
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,127
Chen Qinghe.

163
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,864
If anything happens to Ah Si,

164
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,301
I'll let you know the consequences.

165
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:02,041
SURGERY ONGOING

166
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:09,082
Doctor.

167
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,717
He's out of danger.

168
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,419
However, the patient is still unconscious.

169
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,904
It's confirmed that the blood clot
in his brain has already dissipated.

170
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,341
However, whether the severe shock
he suffered this time

171
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,143
would be beneficial
to regaining his memory

172
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,112
or not,

173
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,881
we'll only find out when he wakes up.

174
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:45,351
Thank you.

175
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:46,619
You're welcome.

176
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,498
<i>Regardless of who he has in his memories,</i>

177
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:00,433
<i>only Yesha would exist</i>

178
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,902
<i>in his life in the future.</i>

179
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:18,518
<i>Ah Xing.</i>

180
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:21,821
<i>Can you please wake up?</i>

181
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,426
<i>I have something really important
to tell you.</i>

182
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:49,649
Why won't you tell the truth?

183
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,018
What do you mean?

184
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,320
You love Ah Si.

185
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:58,658
You love him,

186
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:00,993
but why are you pretending you don't?

187
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:03,963
Because of Shancai?

188
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,671
I also felt sorry for Shancai before.

189
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:13,673
However,

190
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,643
don't you feel sorry for Ah Si

191
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,680
in forcing him to go back to Shancai?

192
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:26,185
Bravely loving him is not selfish,

193
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,188
yet pushing him away is senseless.

194
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,091
You're relying on your youth

195
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,061
and your limitless future

196
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:37,163
to sacrifice

197
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,565
and betray your own feelings.

198
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,935
You think that's the highest form of love.

199
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:45,905
Now,

200
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:48,207
you should know

201
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,211
that tomorrow might not come.

202
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:55,214
However,

203
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,950
the words you can't say today

204
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,787
might become your regret in the future.

205
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:06,092
Yesha.

206
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,463
I only have one son.

207
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,666
Stop tormenting him.

208
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,603
I'm begging you.

209
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,908
Please treasure him.

210
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,252
Think about it carefully.

211
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,934
Stop. Stop beating him up.

212
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:23,803
Stop hitting him.

213
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,471
I really like you.

214
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,608
Wait, don't do this.

215
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,713
Have you ever really liked me?

216
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,555
Actually, I've never really liked you.

217
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,625
If I did,

218
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,727
I won't just leave right now.

219
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:49,729
Yesha.

220
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,099
Daoming Si.

221
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,739
Shancai.

222
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,574
Shancai.

223
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:03,376
<i>Shancai.</i>

224
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:05,544
<i>Shancai.</i>

225
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:07,947
<i>Shancai.</i>

226
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,286
<i>Shancai.</i>

227
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:18,891
<i>Shancai.</i>

228
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,541
Ah Xing, you're awake.

229
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,846
Shancai, Ah Xing is awake.

230
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,952
Congratulations, Daoming Si.

231
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,755
Do you want some water?

232
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,557
Or do you want to eat something?

233
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,159
-Or...
-No, I don't want anything.

234
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,027
Go out first. Let me be alone, okay?

235
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:57,723
Shancai.

236
00:20:58,357 --> 00:20:59,658
I have something to tell you.

237
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:01,827
Go ahead.

238
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:08,067
Another day, maybe.

239
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,336
Okay, that's fine, too.

240
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:11,871
You've taken care of him the whole night.

241
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,773
You look so pale.

242
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,741
Since Daoming Si is awake,

243
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:17,243
you should go home and rest first.

244
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:19,411
There's no need.

245
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:22,448
They'll come over tomorrow anyway.
Don't worry.

246
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:25,217
Come on.

247
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,386
Rest first then come back.

248
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:28,888
Daoming Si needs to rest, too.

249
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:34,260
All right.

250
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:35,995
I'll go ahead.

251
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,263
Stop worrying.

252
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:38,564
I'll be back soon.

253
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:39,732
See you later.

254
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,401
Bye.

255
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,265
Is he asleep?

256
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,102
Why didn't you make a sound?
You scared me.

257
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:51,503
You're even blaming us.

258
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,838
We were standing here for a while.

259
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:54,740
You were just standing there
and not moving at all.

260
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:57,610
Yesha said Ah Si is awake.

261
00:22:58,277 --> 00:22:59,178
Did you see Yesha?

262
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:00,613
We saw her by the elevator earlier.

263
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,249
The doctor said he'd be fine
when he wakes up.

264
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:04,583
However, he's resting now.

265
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,151
He said he wants to be alone.

266
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,555
This guy.

267
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,258
He periodically gets into trouble
and lets us worry about him.

268
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,059
Now, he wants to be alone.

269
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,462
There's nothing we can do.
He's the patient.

270
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:20,432
It seems we can only stand here and
wait for Young Master Daoming Si's orders.

271
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:26,805
Meizuo, let's buy some fruits
nearby first.

272
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:29,074
All right.

273
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:32,678
Lei, we'll leave Young Master
Daoming Si to you.

274
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,480
-See you later.
-Bye.

275
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:06,845
How are you?

276
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:11,116
Qinghe contacted us.

277
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:14,186
It seems he's blaming himself.

278
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:20,025
This is the first time he talked
so clearly.

279
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,732
Good thing he's awake.

280
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:30,769
Based on Ah Si's swimming skills,

281
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:35,474
how could he drown?

282
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:40,946
Maybe it's because he's not
in a good mood recently.

283
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:43,415
Why?

284
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:46,185
I don't know.

285
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:48,120
It seems he...

286
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,926
Never mind. Yesha's with him anyway.

287
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:55,761
He'll recover soon.

288
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:05,504
I really want to go on a vacation.

289
00:25:08,474 --> 00:25:11,243
The industrious Shancai
wants to go on a vacation?

290
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:15,748
Summer is almost over.

291
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:19,551
The beach would soon become lonely.

292
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,664
Wait a moment.

293
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:03,595
What kind of sea do you want?

294
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:11,437
I want waves on the ocean.

295
00:26:12,438 --> 00:26:15,974
The slow and gentle kind.

296
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:18,877
How about the sun?

297
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:24,650
The sun? It's best if it's almost setting.

298
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:32,458
Done.

299
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:37,129
Sign it.

300
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:38,497
Okay.

301
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,080
Thank you.

302
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,690
Can I ask for a favor?

303
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,098
Can you go with me to eat something?

304
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,034
Okay.

305
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,542
<i>Ah Si almost died.</i>

306
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:30,249
He almost disappeared
from this world before me.

307
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:41,093
Good thing God, Buddha,
and Allah protected him.

308
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:44,863
Why are you thanking God and Allah?

309
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,331
Sha.

310
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:49,568
Why can't I love Ah Xing properly?

311
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,271
You're asking me?

312
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:54,373
I want to ask you.

313
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:56,742
Am I too sleepy?

314
00:27:57,176 --> 00:28:00,145
I can't think of a reason
why I can't love him properly.

315
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:03,448
Why?

316
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:10,389
Maybe God is jealous of Ah Xing.

317
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:13,125
He's reluctant to let
such a cute angel like you

318
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:15,027
stay beside him.

319
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,929
What time is it? How long have I slept?

320
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:52,564
You just lied down for five minutes.

321
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:55,934
That's impossible. I must have slept for a
long time. That's why I'm so energetic.

322
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:58,870
-No, you didn't.
-I'm going to the hospital.

323
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:01,039
You can't go to the hospital.
You haven't even slept.

324
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,875
I'm very energetic. I can even run
a marathon. I'm going to the hospital.

325
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:06,511
-You can't.
-I'm going to visit Ah Xing now.

326
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,146
-You can't.
-I have to go.

327
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,115
-I said you can't.
-I'm going there now.

328
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:12,484
I'm telling him I love him. Let go.

329
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:17,222
Move.

330
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:24,763
You're so funny.

331
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:43,982
That door is open.

332
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:45,350
He doesn't want to be alone anymore?

333
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:48,487
Ah Xing's gone.

334
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:49,588
What?

335
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,026
Yesha.

336
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:03,101
<i>She looked as silly as you
when she was standing</i>

337
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:07,839
<i>under the La Sagrada Familia.</i>

338
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:11,643
<i>It's a cute kind of silliness.</i>

339
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:15,614
<i>You wouldn't resist calling her stupid.</i>

340
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,483
<i>She got mad, of course.</i>

341
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:20,886
<i>She turned her head</i>

342
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:24,456
<i>and her long hair flipped in the wind.</i>

343
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:27,826
<i>She smelled like baby powder.</i>

344
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:30,329
<i>She's different.</i>

345
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,164
<i>She's like the sun.</i>

346
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:35,734
<i>When she lifted her head
to look at the stars,</i>

347
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:38,704
<i>she also lit up with them.</i>

348
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:41,640
<i>That's Yesha.</i>

349
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:44,543
<i>And that's Shancai.</i>

350
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:47,746
<i>There's a Shancai.</i>

351
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:52,551
<i>When I woke up, there's also a Yesha.</i>

352
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:56,088
<i>What a big joke.</i>

353
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:00,225
<i>You're also laughing at me.</i>

354
00:31:02,828 --> 00:31:05,530
<i>Stop denying it. I heard you.</i>

355
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:08,166
<i>I don't blame you.</i>

356
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,204
<i>If I were you, I would laugh, too.</i>

357
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:16,241
<i>It's a shame that I'm not you.</i>

358
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:21,713
<i>That's why I want to cry.</i>

359
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,399
Miss, are you looking for someone?

360
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,703
I don't know where he has gone to.

361
00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:53,278
I'll go report it.

362
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:40,852
Ah Xing.

363
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:43,588
Ah Xing.

364
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,259
Ah Xing, you fool.

365
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:49,227
You're ridiculous, you...

366
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:26,798
Yesha.

367
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,534
I thought you left.

368
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:32,704
I left?

369
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,006
Why?

370
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,278
Because you always say
you can't go back anymore.

371
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,280
And you also don't want to go back.

372
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:44,950
However...

373
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,652
I still keep pushing you back to Shancai.

374
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,121
Ah Xing.

375
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:53,458
I messed up

376
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:55,727
everything, right?

377
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:04,569
There's something I want to tell you.

378
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:07,472
-I have something to tell you, too.
-I want to tell you first...

379
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:08,440
I love you.

380
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,548
Originally, I wanted to just keep that
inside of me.

381
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,484
And never say it out loud.

382
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:24,956
Until that day at the swimming pool.

383
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:27,926
When I saved you, I realized

384
00:35:30,095 --> 00:35:31,863
that if you're not by my side

385
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:33,865
and I'm just living alone,

386
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,302
I'd rather die.

387
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,671
What are you talking about?

388
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:43,775
Yes, I'm talking nonsense.

389
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:45,644
I'm crazy.

390
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:48,613
I love you,

391
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,618
but I did so many things I regret.

392
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:01,893
I'm stupid and silly

393
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:04,996
and really infuriating, right?

394
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,435
However, you once said

395
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:13,104
that you like my silliness.

396
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:21,980
You also told me that
no matter who you are,

397
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,382
you'd always like me.

398
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:26,685
Do you remember that?

399
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:31,890
I do.

400
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:36,494
I remember everything

401
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,164
that I've said

402
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,033
and done.

403
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,305
It won't happen again.

404
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:49,140
I won't leave you again.

405
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,045
Regardless if you're Ah Xing or Ah Si,

406
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:58,083
I won't force you
to recover your memories.

407
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:01,152
And I won't force you
to love another person.

408
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:05,356
Because I've had enough being jealous.

409
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:09,494
I don't want to feel that anymore.

410
00:37:20,305 --> 00:37:22,107
I'm done with what I want to say.

411
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:24,743
What do you want to tell me?

412
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,081
The rain is getting stronger.

413
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:47,599
Let's go home.

414
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:51,970
That's what you wanted to tell me?

415
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:10,682
Daoming Si.

416
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:15,220
<i>Today, I finally know</i>

417
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,089
that you've really
completely forgotten me.

418
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,059
You've really forgotten.

419
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:23,394
<i>Regardless how many memories
we have together,</i>

420
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:25,864
<i>the one I love is Yesha.</i>

421
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:57,562
HUAZE LEI
CALLING

422
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:07,058
Good morning, Sha.

423
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:19,137
You're awake?

424
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:21,739
You're making breakfast?

425
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:25,576
How rare.

426
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,212
Go away.

427
00:42:31,516 --> 00:42:33,418
You're happy, right?

428
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:35,453
Right?

429
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:38,089
Right?

430
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,258
Go away.

431
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,563
Drink this.

432
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,868
Last night,

433
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:57,708
Ah Xing must have said something
to you, right?

434
00:42:58,209 --> 00:42:59,177
No.

435
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:01,312
-No?
-No.

436
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:06,584
All right.

437
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:09,620
I'm sure he...

438
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:13,091
He didn't.

439
00:43:13,224 --> 00:43:14,425
No?

440
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:16,894
Cut it out.

441
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:19,297
Do you really think

442
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:23,701
I couldn't feel that you've changed?

443
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:26,871
And Ah Xing loves you so much.

444
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,507
Then he saw you

445
00:43:30,241 --> 00:43:33,611
searching for him in the rain.

446
00:43:33,678 --> 00:43:35,179
And he was so moved.

447
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:36,848
So he...

448
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:38,316
I was the one who kissed him.

449
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:39,984
Really?

450
00:43:40,418 --> 00:43:42,220
I even told him I love him.

451
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:51,596
-Sha.
-Yes.

452
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:54,098
I think I didn't have the courage before.

453
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,968
However, now I know

454
00:43:57,502 --> 00:43:59,871
that the person who doesn't have
the right to talk about the future

455
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:02,039
is the one who doesn't know
how to hold on to today.

456
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:05,877
From now on,

457
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:09,347
I want Ah Si and me to have
no regrets every day.

458
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:24,529
Oh, no.

459
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,832
Well... We have to hurry.

460
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:31,235
I gave you that... ring before.

461
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,538
Do you remember? Where did you put it?

462
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:37,341
Go to your room. Hurry.

463
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:39,343
-Help me find it.
-What are you looking for?

464
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:42,380
The meteor ring I brought back
from Spain last time.

465
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:45,183
The one you took away.
Help me find it. Please.

466
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:47,985
Where did it go?

467
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,989
Miss, my goodness.
Your things are so disorganized.

468
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,824
This one?

469
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:56,160
<i>Amitabha</i>.

470
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:59,397
Good thing it's still here.
I'll go take care of this then.

471
00:44:59,497 --> 00:45:00,765
Take care of it?

472
00:45:01,332 --> 00:45:02,400
You forgot.

473
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,869
I told you this ring is cursed.

474
00:45:04,936 --> 00:45:07,972
You and Ah Xing have a good future now.

475
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:11,742
How can you keep such a scary thing
with you and bring you bad luck?

476
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:15,012
Sha, why are you so superstitious?

477
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:18,015
Being superstitious is better
than you having bad luck.

478
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:21,219
If I can take you and Ah Xing
into church earlier

479
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:23,154
to say, "I do,"

480
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:26,657
I'll even drink Taoist holy water.

481
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,728
Don't drink that first.

482
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:32,630
Let me make a phone call.

483
00:45:32,964 --> 00:45:34,232
Who are you going to call?

484
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,941
Who?

485
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:47,812
Hello.

486
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:25,309
