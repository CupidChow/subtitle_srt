1
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,606
Master... Daoming Si?

2
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:53,640
You know who I am?

3
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:55,709
Why won't I?

4
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,210
I'm your teacher.

5
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,447
My teacher?

6
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:12,993
What's wrong?

7
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:14,461
A flat tire.

8
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,837
Master Daoming Si.

9
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:27,507
You can leave the lowly work to me.

10
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,076
You shouldn't be bothered by it.

11
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:30,143
It doesn't bother me.

12
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,379
This is my responsibility as a student.

13
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:33,346
What an honor.

14
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,481
Seriously, I'm totally fine.

15
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,350
Why are you so scared of me?

16
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:38,919
No, I'm not.

17
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,053
I'm not.

18
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,155
So why are you so nervous?

19
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,491
I'm not.

20
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,459
Really.

21
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:49,362
If you can recall your memory someday,

22
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,165
and you remember
you changed a tire for me, I'll be doomed.

23
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,266
What?

24
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,836
No, nothing...

25
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,077
You stepped on my foot.

26
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:05,812
I stepped on your...

27
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,948
I'm sorry. Please don't move...

28
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:10,484
-What are you doing?
-I'll wipe it clean for you.

29
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,686
No. Why are you doing that?

30
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,221
I'm wiping your shoes...

31
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:15,989
No, you do not have to.

32
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:17,190
No, that's totally fine.

33
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,658
This is how it works.

34
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,094
It's like some understanding between us.

35
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,130
-An understanding.
-An understanding?

36
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,966
Have I told you to do it before?

37
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:28,535
Was I that harsh?

38
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,104
No, not really.

39
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:32,839
Not at all.

40
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:33,940
No.

41
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:37,878
Please be honest.

42
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,257
Master Daoming Si.

43
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,360
Do you... really not remember anything?

44
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,063
Mr. Ah Liang...

45
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,299
Now you're flattering me...

46
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,402
Don't keep saying "flattering," okay?
All right?

47
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,005
Oh, okay...

48
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,876
Could I please...

49
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,379
Actually...

50
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,414
I have a question.

51
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,649
You're flatter...

52
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:19,553
I'll work flat-out to answer the question.

53
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:20,921
Any question.

54
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:28,829
The past me and the new me.
Which one do you think is more fun?

55
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,163
Of course it's...

56
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,935
Do I have to answer it?

57
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:38,371
Of course. I wouldn't ask you
in the first place.

58
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,307
Oh, the answer.

59
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,242
How should I put it?

60
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:44,177
The new you...

61
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:46,913
The new you is...

62
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,982
nicer than before.

63
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:50,517
More like us.

64
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:56,590
Like you got rid of your harsh part.

65
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:58,391
That's it.

66
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:09,569
I see.

67
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:10,470
Thank you, teacher.

68
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:12,305
My pleasure, Master Daoming Si.

69
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,607
It's my pleasure.

70
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,942
Could you please do me a favor?

71
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,111
Yes, of course. I'll do my best.

72
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,547
Could you please stop calling me "master"?

73
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:25,752
I will.

74
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,825
Okay...

75
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:36,229
Why are you laughing?

76
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:38,565
No, nothing.

77
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:42,569
I mean, I've never imagined that I can
sit next to Master Daoming Si one day.

78
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:48,108
I can even chat with you
on the side of a road.

79
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:52,545
Great.

80
00:06:58,752 --> 00:06:59,653
Right.

81
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,454
Where are you going?

82
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,656
I'm going to a wedding party.

83
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,324
I dress pretty formally today.

84
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:05,592
Really?

85
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,260
My friend is getting married.

86
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:12,465
Where are you going?

87
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:16,603
-I was supposed to go to the market.
-For dinner?

88
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:51,304
HUAZE LEI

89
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:01,181
Hello?

90
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,450
<i>Did you sleep well?</i>

91
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,887
I slept well, thanks to your blessing.

92
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,291
Why did you wake up so early?

93
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:15,695
<i>Because I miss Yingde.</i>

94
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:23,937
This should be enough.

95
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,972
"This should be enough"?

96
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,507
It is far from enough!

97
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:29,542
How is it possible?

98
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,979
I hope Master Daoming Si is here.

99
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,547
You're right.

100
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,384
No, honey.

101
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,518
Don't worry.

102
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:42,088
If I can sell that car today,
I can have an advance on bonus.

103
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,224
I'm afraid...

104
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,059
There is nothing to be afraid of.

105
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,761
It will be successful this time.

106
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,663
Yes. It's about Shancai's tuition fee.

107
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,298
We must succeed!

108
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,569
-This is it!
-This is it!

109
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,875
Dad, mom, I'll go hang out with Huaze Lei.

110
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:02,976
Okay...

111
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:10,950
Honey.

112
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:16,523
Did you hear who Shancai
is going to meet up with?

113
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:21,294
I think it's Master Huaze.

114
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,165
Master Huaze?

115
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,236
Master Huaze?

116
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:37,844
You mean Master Daoming Si
is no longer in Shancai's life...

117
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,213
but she got...

118
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,249
A handsome, gentle,

119
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:48,588
-and generous Master Huaze?
-Master Huaze?

120
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:51,691
Honey.

121
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,226
-That's great!
-Indeed.

122
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:58,098
Do you feel that suddenly,
our house is brighter?

123
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,266
We don't even need lights anymore.

124
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:05,238
That's because a bright light
is shining on us.

125
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:09,809
I didn't know that our daughter, Shancai,
has such a great future.

126
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:12,946
I can't open my eyes.

127
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:13,913
Me neither.

128
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,348
It's too bright.

129
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:16,583
Too bright.

130
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,852
-Too bright.
-That's great.

131
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,967
The sky is as blue as it used to be
even after you graduated.

132
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:36,903
Yes.

133
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,339
How is it possible?

134
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,610
I thought the skies in Yingde
would change.

135
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:50,049
That's weird.

136
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:52,452
You used to tease me a lot.

137
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,588
Now I'm missing the days
when you boys were around.

138
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:01,161
That's good to hear.

139
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:04,264
Come and visit me.

140
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:05,698
We can watch the sky together.

141
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:18,845
Shancai.

142
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,784
I'll be flying to Japan this afternoon.

143
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:32,458
How long will you be there?

144
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:35,295
I don't know.

145
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,435
Don't let me worry about you.

146
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,443
Hey.

147
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,912
Didn't you promise me just now?

148
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:56,749
It will be fine.

149
00:11:57,584 --> 00:12:01,588
I feel lonely all of a sudden.

150
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,058
Daoming Si went missing.

151
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,227
Now you are going abroad.

152
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:10,730
So this is what graduation is like.

153
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,300
We can never be together
like the old days.

154
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:19,505
What are you doing?

155
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:24,444
Do you know you're making a long face?

156
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,787
You had so many expressions before.

157
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,391
You laughed when you were happy.

158
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:41,828
You railed when you were angry.

159
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:52,171
You stood here scolding us F4 when we met
on the rooftop for the first time.

160
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,907
You do remember that.

161
00:12:58,411 --> 00:12:59,712
Do you want to scold us again?

162
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:02,181
Now?

163
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,417
Why should I do that for no reason?

164
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:06,953
Because we deserved that.

165
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,291
If we didn't step into your life,

166
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:17,497
you must be working and learning happily.

167
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:26,539
I miss the Shancai who scolds people.

168
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:29,976
I used to scold people a lot before.

169
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,713
I forget how I scolded you.

170
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,452
You cursed us to go bankrupt.

171
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,323
To die because of obesity.

172
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,291
To go to hell in the afterlife.

173
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,960
You called us "Pig Head 4."

174
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,363
Pig Head 4!

175
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:57,203
You jerks!

176
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,771
I curse you.

177
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,907
I curse you to have brain hemorrhage.

178
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:04,277
Especially the big pig's head Daoming Si.

179
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:09,682
I curse you choke on eggs
and be hit by meteors,

180
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:11,751
until you remember everything.

181
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:16,756
You shall crawl and scramble
back to me now!

182
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,193
And you, Huaze Lei.

183
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,665
I curse you to be exhausted from sleeping.

184
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,536
And I will scold you in your nightmares.

185
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:32,772
Scold about what?

186
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:38,945
About you.

187
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:42,215
If you fail to come back to Taipei soon,

188
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,719
I'll fly to Japan
and shave all your hair off.

189
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:53,826
Remember,

190
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,897
no matter what you will encounter,

191
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,934
you need to have the spirit
just like that.

192
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:04,771
This is the Shancai I know.

193
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:13,212
But I didn't hear that.

194
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:16,949
Hear what?

195
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:18,951
The promise you made to me.

196
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:29,962
I swear to God, I won't let
Huaze Lei worry about me anymore.

197
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:20,406
Why are you standing here?

198
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:21,440
Why did you hit me?

199
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:25,745
Why did you hit me?

200
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:27,780
I'll call the police.

201
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,022
That's all. Thank you.

202
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,296
Is "Shancai" some kind of vegetable?

203
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:44,297
Oh, no.

204
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,065
It's a kind of grass.

205
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:50,336
It'll still sprout in spring no matter
how hard people tread on it.

206
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:52,705
What a lively name!

207
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:54,073
My name is Yesha.

208
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,107
Is "Ye" your surname?

209
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,877
No. Yesha is Elsa.

210
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:00,313
Yesha.

211
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:02,648
It's a good name.

212
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:04,350
Any special meaning?

213
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:08,487
In Hebrew, Elsa means
"Promise with the God."

214
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:10,523
That's special.

215
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,824
A promise with God.

216
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:13,059
What did you promise?

217
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,393
That's a secret.

218
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,597
Nice to meet you, Shancai.

219
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:18,965
Same here, Yesha.

220
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,767
Two fruit shave ice. Please pay first.

221
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,603
Okay, the bill is on me.

222
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,805
Consider it a welcome to Taiwan gift.

223
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:26,806
Okay, thank you.

224
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:28,608
Thank you.

225
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,247
Shancai.

226
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:36,282
I have a question.

227
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,284
Does your hand hurt?

228
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:40,786
Yes.

229
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:41,921
It hurts badly.

230
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,223
Me too.

231
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:49,895
I didn't imagine I'd meet a girl
punching with her fists like me.

232
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:54,200
I guess your boyfriend must
respect you a lot.

233
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:06,879
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

234
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:07,813
That's okay.

235
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,148
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

236
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,250
How about you?

237
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,119
Your boyfriend must respect you, right?

238
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:14,620
I don't have one.

239
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:17,156
Tell you a secret.

240
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:18,224
I have never fallen in love.

241
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,826
Liar.

242
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,928
You're pretty
and have such a good personality.

243
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,330
I don't believe you.

244
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:26,499
It's true.

245
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,800
I don't believe you.

246
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:31,904
Shancai.

247
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:35,141
What does love feel like?

248
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,644
Love is...

249
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:43,349
When you fall in love with someone,
no matter what happens,

250
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,184
he's always the first one
who comes to your mind.

251
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:49,121
Your heart beats so fast
when you're thinking about him.

252
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:54,994
There seems to be a hole in your heart
when you lose him.

253
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,265
No matter where you are
or what you are doing,

254
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:04,704
there is an invisible wound
that gives you pain.

255
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,742
So you were in love with someone before?

256
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,778
Here is your change, 80 yuan. Thank you.

257
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:13,746
Thank you.

258
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,918
I had forgotten I have to get to work.

259
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,387
Where's your workplace?

260
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:22,588
It's a cake store.

261
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,756
A cake store?

262
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:25,958
Are you in a hurry?

263
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:28,594
It's very cold.

264
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:30,196
Can I go with you?

265
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:37,903
It's super cold.

266
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:48,547
How's this place?

267
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:49,982
It's a cute store.

268
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:54,320
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

269
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,388
Even your suits are so cute.

270
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,991
It must be a joy to work here.

271
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,527
I think so,

272
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,629
but the others don't share
the same thought.

273
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:05,598
We often don't have enough people
around here.

274
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:07,733
Really?

275
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:11,270
So, can I work here?

276
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:14,306
-You really want to work here?
-Yes.

277
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,641
I'll tell my boss, then.

278
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:16,742
Okay.

279
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:17,810
Great.

280
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:20,379
I should tell Ah Xing too.

281
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:23,649
Ah Xing?

282
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:26,519
You tell everything to Ah Xing.

283
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,420
Who is Ah Xing?

284
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:31,724
A stray dog.

285
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:33,125
A stray dog?

286
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:36,428
He got lost so I adopted him.

287
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,864
I'll bring him in someday
to meet with you.

288
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:39,799
Okay.

289
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:42,067
Is it a boy or a girl?

290
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,004
It's a boy.

291
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:47,540
Is it fierce?

292
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:50,042
Sometimes.

293
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:54,380
<i>Eighty bucks per hour.</i>

294
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:58,417
It was a cute cake store.

295
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,953
My new friend is cute too.

296
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,621
Why don't you come and visit?

297
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:03,856
I can introduce her to you.

298
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:07,626
Okay.

299
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:08,828
I'll take her here tomorrow.

300
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,029
Why so sudden?

301
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,331
Because she is amazing.

302
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:13,532
I think you will like her.

303
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:15,701
"Shancai"?

304
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:21,540
It's a weird name.

305
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:26,912
So is Daoming Si.

306
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:29,949
Fine...

307
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,717
Can I pick you up
when you get off work tomorrow?

308
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:32,985
Deal.

309
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:34,854
Don't be a liar.

310
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,188
Fine. You're so mean.

311
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:38,090
Don't you have an early shift tomorrow?

312
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:39,525
Go to bed.

313
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:40,459
No.

314
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,095
Come on.

315
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:44,129
No.

316
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,497
I'll beat you up if you don't.

317
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:07,152
"Met a new friend, Shancai."

318
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,097
Cover yourself with the blanket.

319
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:19,298
-It's hot.
-You'll get a cold.

320
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:21,400
-No.
-How childish you are.

321
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:30,142
Don't mess around.

322
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:31,944
Just get some sleep.

323
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,079
Yesha.

324
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:36,081
Yesha.

325
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,350
Does it hurt again?

326
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:44,857
Where is your medicine?

327
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:45,958
Is it in your bag?

328
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:47,092
Where is your bag?

329
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:51,931
Where is your medicine?

330
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,733
Yesha.

331
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,201
Does it hurt?

332
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,336
Just a second.

333
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,362
Open up! I need some medicine!

334
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:25,364
Hey.

335
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:27,099
Why are you yelling this late at night?

336
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:30,035
My sister is in pain
and she needs some painkiller.

337
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,971
No pharmacy is open this late at night.

338
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,806
Take her to the emergency room.

339
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,240
I don't care!

340
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,575
Where is the emergency room?

341
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,243
In the hospital, idiot!

342
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,663
That's really good.

343
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,432
Yesha.

344
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,567
I'll take you...

345
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,469
Let's go to Kenting, okay?

346
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:06,839
One day, granny, Ah Xing, and I will
travel to Kenting.

347
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,941
We'll watch the sea and the starry sky.

348
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,342
How is that, granny?

349
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:11,777
We can discuss later.

350
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:14,346
It's hard to make promises
with this granny.

351
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:17,416
No, I will keep promising to you.

352
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:19,018
What nonsense are you saying?

353
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,254
I can't reason out with you foreigners.

354
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:23,455
Deal?

355
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,457
We will travel to Kenting one day.

356
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:28,861
Let's go to the hospital.

357
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:31,764
Granny got me some painkiller.

358
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,798
It doesn't hurt anymore.

359
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,301
It won't cure you.

360
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:38,437
Did you hear what I said?

361
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:39,405
Let's go.

362
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:40,773
You'll have a full-body checkup.

363
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:41,907
You must be losing your mind.

364
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:44,009
Didn't I just tell you I'm fine?

365
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:45,611
I'm no longer in pain.

366
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:46,879
You were in so much pain just now.

367
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:48,514
Just like what happened in the wine house!

368
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,550
There's nothing serious if it just hurts
every now and then for girls, okay?

369
00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:53,585
It's not okay.

370
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:54,987
Never mind.

371
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,288
I hate hospitals.

372
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:58,891
I'll get angry.

373
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,564
For real?

374
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:11,537
It's nothing.

375
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,072
I know my body.

376
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,075
It just hurts a little sometimes.

377
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:17,743
Nothing serious.

378
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:18,744
Don't get angry.

379
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:24,049
Shitball.

380
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:25,184
What should I do?

381
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,285
Ah Xing is angry at me.

382
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:29,655
He's really scary when he's mad.

383
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:30,989
I'm so scared.

384
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:35,227
Your feet...

385
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,435
Did you go out barefoot?

386
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:49,908
Stand still.

387
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:52,244
Don't move.

388
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:55,781
Give me your feet.

389
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:57,816
-For what?
-Just give it to me.

390
00:26:57,883 --> 00:26:58,717
Step on this.

391
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:03,555
Thanks.

392
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:09,995
<i>This is a footprint of Ah Xing</i>

393
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:11,964
<i>when he rushed out barefoot
to buy medicine for me.</i>

394
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,109
Don't be mad.

395
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:29,014
I promise I'll go to the hospital
if it hurts again.

396
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:30,949
Don't be mad.

397
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:33,552
Do you know why I'm mad?

398
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,556
Because you scared me.

399
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:39,658
I'm scared by the idea of losing you.

400
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:45,097
No matter who I am now,
I just want you to know that...

401
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,934
I care about you.

402
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,739
I want to take good care of you.

403
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:56,208
I want to stay with you forever.

404
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:53,932
Okay.

405
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:55,467
Welcome.

406
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:58,136
Madam, do you want to buy a car?

407
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:01,540
It's "young lady."

408
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:06,712
You should call them young ladies
to make a good impression on females.

409
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,547
How about male customers?

410
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:12,451
You should praise their tastes
and their status.

411
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:13,819
Understand?

412
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:14,987
Yes.

413
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,521
Understood.

414
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,790
Honey, let's try it one more time.

415
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,759
No wonder why you can't sell a single car.

416
00:29:20,826 --> 00:29:22,027
Once more chance, please.

417
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,229
-Young lady.
-Young lady...

418
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:31,937
This is Shancai's sweet home.

419
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:34,273
Boss?

420
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,674
Yes.

421
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:38,143
Okay, just a second, please.

422
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,778
Phone call for you, Shancai!

423
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:45,083
Boss, thank you
for taking care of Shancai.

424
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,785
Come and visit us when you're free.

425
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:47,886
Okay...

426
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:50,589
Hi, boss.

427
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:52,724
Yes, I'm heading there.

428
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,060
Buy some oranges?

429
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,261
How many do you need?

430
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:58,563
Okay, got it.

431
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,132
No worries. Bye.

432
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:03,669
Mom.

433
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:08,507
-Mom.
-Come here, Shancai.

434
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:11,710
Do you think this is a suitable car
for mom?

435
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,278
-This one?
-This one?

436
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:15,447
Yes, it is!

437
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:16,415
Madam.

438
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,616
This...

439
00:30:17,683 --> 00:30:20,385
-Young lady!
-Young lady.

440
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:23,689
This is our latest model.

441
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,157
It has this aerodynamic design.

442
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:29,795
It has the trending silver
and pink combination.

443
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:30,696
Take a look.

444
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:36,001
You two are elegant and graceful.

445
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:40,005
What a beautiful pair of sisters.

446
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:42,607
Just like the sisters in that TV show <i>SOS.</i>

447
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,110
This is the best car for you.

448
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:46,745
Definitely a perfect match.

449
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:49,247
What are you doing?

450
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:51,950
-We are practicing.
-Practicing.

451
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,051
Practicing what?

452
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:58,056
Your dad has a poor sales performance.

453
00:30:58,123 --> 00:31:02,294
So as your mom, I have to sell myself.

454
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:03,195
No...

455
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,697
I have to teach him how to sell cars.

456
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:09,501
Shancai. What is your opinion
about your dad's selling techniques?

457
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:11,269
Dad, you're trying your best.

458
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,238
I believe the sales will be high
this month.

459
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,307
That's great.

460
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:16,942
Did you hear that, honey?

461
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:21,246
After hearing Shancai's words,
I have more faith in myself.

462
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:24,316
I believe my sales
will be the highest this month.

463
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:26,084
But honey,

464
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:29,721
I think you should show more honesty
for selling cars.

465
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:32,824
Don't flatter the customers
with words like "elegant" or "graceful."

466
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:36,795
That's embarrassing.

467
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:38,363
Is it?

468
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:41,466
Shancai.

469
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:44,236
-Do you think it's embarrassing?
-Yeah.

470
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:51,042
What's embarrassing is being forced
to call your mom "young lady."

471
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,180
It's warming.

472
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:57,649
Warming.

473
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,385
Shancai.

474
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:03,989
Do you have any suggestions
for your dad on selling cars?

475
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:08,393
I don't know either.

476
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:19,805
But based on my experience selling cakes,

477
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:22,808
we will ask the customer
what's the cake for at first.

478
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:25,210
They might send it or eat it.

479
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,846
Or maybe it's for a party
or for someone's birthday.

480
00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:29,548
Then we can suggest flavors accordingly.

481
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:34,119
So, dad, you can ask your customers
why do they want a car?

482
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:37,055
Get to know the customers' needs,
so that you can be more persuasive.

483
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:40,759
Shancai, it makes sense.

484
00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:42,794
Shancai, you're so smart.

485
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:44,629
You've got a point.

486
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:45,864
No, you've got nine points.

487
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,666
You are my good daughter.

488
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:50,202
Yes. Shancai is the smartest.

489
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,370
Honey, let's do it again...

490
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:53,872
-One more try.
-Okay.

491
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:55,674
Come on. Okay, listen.

492
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,108
Be honest. Right. Then what?

493
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:59,644
Dad, I'm off to work. I'm rooting for you.

494
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:01,046
Okay.

495
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:02,481
-Bye.
-Bye.

496
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,016
Madam.

497
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:06,718
Are you satisfied with our cars?

498
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,390
What will you use it for?

499
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:14,092
Let's see.

500
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:19,064
I want a car that I can drive
around myself.

501
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:25,136
My husband's business is booming now.
He's extremely busy.

502
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:27,772
He has no time to drive me around.

503
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:34,813
Before we got married,
he once rented a lemon.

504
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:38,850
He drove us to the Yangming Mountain
to watch the night view.

505
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:41,486
He drove us to the beach
to enjoy the seaside.

506
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:45,657
I thought I was the happiest woman
in the world.

507
00:33:45,724 --> 00:33:52,197
<i>However, this didn't last long</i>

508
00:33:52,264 --> 00:33:55,967
<i>Before my dream shattered</i>

509
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:59,437
So, sir, is there a car
that can go into the wild?

510
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:03,642
A robust car that let me travel around?
A car strong and steady enough?

511
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:12,317
Sir?

512
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:13,818
Honey!

513
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:16,821
Concentrate.

514
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,423
Right.

515
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,492
Concentrate.

516
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:22,761
Madam.

517
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:27,465
I would say a hatchback is what you need.

518
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:28,700
Right.

519
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,406
You can take your husband, your daughter,
the whole family to the beach.

520
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:35,874
To the mountains.

521
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:42,647
You will enjoy that beautiful life
as a whole family.

522
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:43,682
Great.

523
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:44,749
So...

524
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:47,519
Can it be customized
as an electric flower car?

525
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:49,688
-That would be unnecessary.
-Why?

526
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,057
You can customize it into a hearse.

527
00:34:52,157 --> 00:34:53,725
All you need to do is driving it uphill.

528
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:54,926
No need to drive it back down.

529
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:56,561
Honey, concentrate.

530
00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:58,597
I know...

531
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,465
-Have you learned anything?
-I tell you what.

532
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:02,434
If I got the highest sales number
this month,

533
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,036
I will be able to buy a nice car
and take all of us for a ride.

534
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,771
Great, I believe in you.

535
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:08,673
Okay, one more.

536
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,808
Honey, thank you.

537
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,922
CHICKEN SALAD
MANGO YOGHURT SALAD

538
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:29,160
Goodbye.

539
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,166
Listen...

540
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:37,369
What?

541
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:39,170
Not bad...

542
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:40,839
Come on. Listen.

543
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,108
Listen.

544
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:44,876
This is the best part.

545
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:46,811
Is it?

546
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:48,346
Not bad.

547
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:49,247
Pretty cool.

548
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:51,416
Why are you in a rush?

549
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:52,817
None of your business.

550
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:54,886
I'm worried about him.

551
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:58,189
He's gonna pick up Yesha at the store.

552
00:35:58,890 --> 00:35:59,858
Wait.

553
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:00,825
Take this.

554
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:03,028
It's fine, take it.

555
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,898
Don't forget to hand in
your experience reports.

556
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:13,371
I should find a girlfriend
as soon as possible.

557
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:17,409
Then, I can be as focused as him
when it comes to working.

558
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,645
Plus, I can get off work early.

559
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:21,546
It must be nice.

560
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,014
Not on my watch.

561
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:25,850
That's not fair.

562
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,453
That's because you're my star employee.

563
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,488
After all, you're my best classmate.

564
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:35,160
I'm rooting for you.

565
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:37,429
Really?

566
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:40,131
I swear.

567
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:51,476
Go wash the dishes.

568
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:54,412
Brother.

569
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:55,747
Good brother.

570
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:58,917
This is not fair.

571
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:06,424
My wifey.

572
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:09,494
Look at the sunset. Gorgeous, right?

573
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:15,300
How can there be a sunset
when it's noon now?

574
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:02,640
Daoming Si.

575
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:05,643
Daoming Si!

576
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:17,589
Daoming Si!

577
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:29,868
Daoming Si!

578
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:33,137
Daoming Si.

579
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:36,507
Daoming Si.

580
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:39,577
Daoming Si!

581
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,026
Daoming Si.

582
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:35,066
Shancai!

583
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:37,535
-<i>It seems like yesterday.</i>
-Shancai!

584
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:40,204
<i>Daoming Si was chasing the bus I was on.</i>

585
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,572
<i>He chased me so far.</i>

586
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,209
<i>From Taipei to Barcelona.</i>

587
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:49,514
<i>He finally got me off the bus
with all his efforts.</i>

588
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:09,334
<i>I understand how strong he was.</i>

589
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,037
<i>This time, I'm the one chasing Daoming Si.</i>

590
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:17,108
<i>No matter where he is,
I will get him back.</i>

591
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,478
Bye, boss.

592
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,380
Hurry up.

593
00:41:22,447 --> 00:41:24,515
What's the hurry?

594
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:26,384
Why is Shancai not here?

595
00:41:26,451 --> 00:41:28,086
She hasn't been around for a while.

596
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,554
Maybe another day.

597
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,855
Come on.

598
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:39,630
Why are we coming back here?

599
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:40,898
To get your drawing tools.

600
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,033
Why?

601
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,671
You always put
your pens and pigments everywhere.

602
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:48,506
There must be a lot
of your pens and pigments.

603
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:50,108
Right.

604
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,610
You didn't color your paintings recently.

605
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,884
I told you last time...

606
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:03,921
See? You never put away your stuff.

607
00:42:04,589 --> 00:42:05,990
I'm always the one cleaning things up.

608
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,198
I'm talking to you, okay?

609
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:15,266
Your pigments.

610
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:18,202
What are you looking at...

611
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:25,176
DAOMING SI, I KNOW YOU ARE

612
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:26,177
ON YOUR WAY HOME.

613
00:42:26,244 --> 00:42:29,380
I WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU FOREVER.

614
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:32,984
Someone is waiting for you.

615
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:38,289
Someone that seems to love...

616
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:39,390
No.

617
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:43,661
Someone that loves you deeply.

618
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:52,336
You're not the only one who's astray.

619
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,373
Her love is astray too.

620
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:03,915
<i>Daoming Si...</i>

621
00:43:10,555 --> 00:43:11,889
<i>Daoming Si.</i>

622
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:37,849
<i>Daoming Si...</i>

623
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,691
Who is she?

624
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:00,925
