1
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:04,491
Miss Shancai, please.

2
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:05,959
Thank you.

3
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,741
Please have a seat.

4
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,925
Please have some tea.

5
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,060
Thank you.

6
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,634
What are you doing here?

7
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:49,636
I...

8
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,905
Grandpa Gao asked me to come.

9
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:55,075
Grandpa Gao?

10
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:59,413
How dare you call President Gao "Grandpa."

11
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:02,416
What are you thinking?

12
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,218
You spoil my plans every time.

13
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,954
I don't know what you're talking about.

14
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:09,990
Stop playing the fool.

15
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:15,262
You must have told something
to President Gao.

16
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:18,098
That's why I can't close the merger

17
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:19,900
between Daoming Corporation
and Gao Corporation.

18
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,002
Merger?

19
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:24,371
What does it have to do with me?

20
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:25,872
Everything.

21
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,040
Grandpa.

22
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,913
Good morning, President Gao.

23
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,881
Sorry I'm late.

24
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,016
No worries.

25
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,220
Shancai.

26
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:42,456
Thank you so much.

27
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:51,031
After 20 years, I finally had
a good sleep last night.

28
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,933
That's why I overslept.

29
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:00,574
I see you have met each other,
so no need to introduce you two.

30
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:01,975
Great.

31
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:04,244
I'll go straight to the point.

32
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,648
Gao Corporation's success
is due to my hard work

33
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:11,518
and my employees' efforts.

34
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:17,524
We hope to find someone
who can take good care of its future.

35
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:23,296
President Gao, please do not listen
to this mouthy girl--

36
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:29,236
President Daoming,
I approved the merger proposal.

37
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:33,740
You finally see it my way.

38
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,512
It has nothing to do with your way.

39
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,847
Shancai is the sole reason.

40
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,551
She helped me find the most precious thing
in my entire life.

41
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,454
That's why I decided to retire early.

42
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:54,561
The merger will push through
because of Shancai.

43
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,253
I don't want to owe you any favors.

44
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,358
So, you can make a request.

45
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,527
A request?

46
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,164
Ask anything you want.

47
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,634
I will make it happen.

48
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,139
I have nothing to say to people like you.

49
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:40,874
Wait.

50
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,178
I won't owe you a favor.

51
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,416
Tell me what you want anytime.

52
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:58,625
Thank you for coming.

53
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,230
-Welcome.
-I'm sorry. I'm late.

54
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:04,397
Take it easy.

55
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:05,966
I'll wait here until you get off work.

56
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,100
You'll wait for me?

57
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,368
No date today?

58
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:09,769
A date with you.

59
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,505
He'll meet us tonight.
Let's go stargazing.

60
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:14,107
I'm not sure about that.

61
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:17,077
You won't get to see stars
if a third wheel tags along.

62
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,612
I don't care. You have to.

63
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,013
You have to.

64
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,382
Fine. Let me get changed.

65
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:26,353
Yesha.

66
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:29,923
Shouldn't you pick me up at 10:00 p.m.?

67
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,260
I dropped by to tell you
that Da Xin's team is playing basketball,

68
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,662
and their forward got hurt,
so I'll play as substitute.

69
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,964
But I already told Shancai our plan.

70
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:39,199
I'm sorry.

71
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,234
Oh, crap. How come?

72
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,036
I know I'm such a jerk.

73
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:45,772
Tomorrow, okay? I promise. Please.

74
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,441
Fine.

75
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:49,809
The bill will be on you tomorrow.

76
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,678
Fine. Be careful on your way home tonight.

77
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,113
Okay. Bye.

78
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,322
Who were you talking to?

79
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,291
Ah Xing. I hate him.

80
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:07,227
He told me that there is something else
he has to do.

81
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:13,767
Yesha, I...

82
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,436
Daoming Si!

83
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:39,259
Shancai.

84
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:40,860
So you know Ah Xing?

85
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,595
Sorry, Daoming Si.

86
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:44,531
You do?

87
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,299
Have we met before?

88
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,437
Don't mind him, Shancai.

89
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:54,274
He forgot all his friends
after the car accident.

90
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:57,377
When did you meet each other?

91
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:00,814
I...

92
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:06,119
I'm Daoming Si's... junior in college.

93
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,589
So you study in Yingde University, too?

94
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:11,791
What a coincidence.

95
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:16,463
Ah Xing, don't play basketball tonight.

96
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:20,800
Since you met your schoolmate,
we should have fun tonight.

97
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:22,635
Right, Shancai?

98
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:25,805
How about this?

99
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,074
I'll stay in the store.

100
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,876
You two go buy some snacks.

101
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:31,811
We will go to Yangming Mountain tonight.

102
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:34,881
Is that a deal?

103
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,016
They got rice cakes.

104
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,186
Yesha will be devouring them.

105
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:16,256
Daoming Si.

106
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:19,292
Grab anything you want, be my guest.

107
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,103
<i>Daoming Si is in love with Yesha now.</i>

108
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,138
<i>Daoming Si is in love with Yesha now.</i>

109
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:34,307
<i>Gosh, what should I do?</i>

110
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:35,909
<i>Daoming Si and Yesha.</i>

111
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:37,477
<i>What should I do?</i>

112
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,148
Do you want some pork jerky?

113
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,385
Okay. I'll get some more for you.

114
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,125
I haven't heard from you for a long time.

115
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,160
Why do you want to hang out now?

116
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,643
There were four of us sitting here
in the past.

117
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:50,116
It's only you and me now.

118
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,389
Meizuo.

119
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,926
Have you ever thought

120
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:04,030
that maybe, one day,
this place will be torn down and rebuilt?

121
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,075
You're acting weird.

122
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,612
Why are you so emotional all of a sudden?

123
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,360
I met Ah Si a few days ago.

124
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,865
A few days ago?

125
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,467
Why haven't you told me until now?

126
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,907
I was hesitant to tell you.

127
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,544
Because Ah Si is...

128
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,012
Where is he?

129
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,414
Does he remember you?

130
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:01,854
He's changed.

131
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,160
He isn't that cocky guy anymore.

132
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:11,264
He's now working at a restaurant.

133
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,602
I even saw him mopping the floor.

134
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,646
He even picked up a coin from the floor.

135
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,815
You liar.

136
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:30,516
That can't be Daoming Si.

137
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,286
Did you mistake him for someone else?

138
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:41,928
But that Ah Si who didn't behave
like Daoming Si told me...

139
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,866
that he loves his current life.

140
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,441
He hopes that we won't
disturb him anymore.

141
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:00,780
What did he mean by "disturb"?

142
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,584
Doesn't he want to find his past?

143
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,023
No.

144
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:12,659
I guess that's what he meant.

145
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:21,801
I don't believe it.

146
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:25,972
Me neither.

147
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:30,076
But that is what he told me.

148
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,448
When Ah Si told me that...

149
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,987
I felt like he was a stranger.

150
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:46,492
There seems to be an invisible wall
between us.

151
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:01,708
What are you doing?

152
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:03,576
I'll tell Shancai.

153
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,180
What if Ah Si runs away again?

154
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,352
Even if he told us not to disturb him,

155
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:15,188
I don't believe he will give up Shancai.

156
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,942
MEIZUO CALLING
ANSWER?

157
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:37,877
Hello.

158
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,813
I'm not Shancai.
She stepped out for a while.

159
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,115
<i>I'm her friend.</i>

160
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,350
<i>Do you want to leave a message for her?</i>

161
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,419
Please tell her this is Meizuo.

162
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,988
Listen, this is urgent.

163
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,523
I've got news about Ah Si.

164
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:52,625
<i>Tell her to call me immediately.</i>

165
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:55,895
Ah Si?

166
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:01,033
Are you talking about Daoming Si?

167
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:07,573
So, Daoming Si is Shancai's...

168
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,610
Her boyfriend. Her missing boyfriend.
Do you understand?

169
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,245
<i>Hello?</i>

170
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:13,713
<i>Hello?</i>

171
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,521
What a small world.

172
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:24,223
Right.

173
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:28,294
So, you should know about F4, right?

174
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,071
<i>Should I tell him?</i>

175
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,474
<i>How should I tell Daoming Si about it?</i>

176
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:52,852
Shancai?

177
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,221
You...

178
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,224
Are you all right?

179
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:01,260
I'm fine.

180
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:04,430
Maybe it's my contact lenses.

181
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:19,579
<i>No, I can't give up.</i>

182
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:24,350
<i>Even if Daoming Si is in love with Yesha,
I can't give up without doing anything.</i>

183
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:25,918
<i>Yes. I can't.</i>

184
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,754
-Daoming Si--
-I have something...

185
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,091
Go ahead.

186
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,695
Were we very close in the past?

187
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,663
You remember.

188
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:44,337
We are very close.

189
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,341
I want to ask you...

190
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:52,178
did I have a girlfriend?

191
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:55,848
Was there a girl that I like?

192
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,623
Why do you ask?

193
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,526
Do you remember something about that girl?

194
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,828
No, I haven't remembered anything.

195
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,029
I just...

196
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:14,967
saw a message for me.

197
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:17,336
So I...

198
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:18,604
What message?

199
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:20,239
She...

200
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:23,175
She...

201
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,381
Nothing important.

202
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,182
Can we save it for later?

203
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,318
Let's go back. Yesha is waiting for us.

204
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,686
"I know...

205
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,989
you're on your way home.

206
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,626
I will be waiting for you...

207
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,429
forever."

208
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:47,300
Is this the message?

209
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:54,340
She wrote all over the wall,
saying how she missed him.

210
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,011
A wall full of "Daoming Si."

211
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:11,490
She couldn't find you...

212
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:15,394
from Barcelona to Taipei.

213
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,231
She posted her messages...

214
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,469
on the missing persons boards
all over Taipei.

215
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,272
But still, they didn't help you
recall your memory.

216
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,744
Are you asking about this girl?

217
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:44,724
Daoming Si, turn around, please.

218
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,929
The answer is right behind you.

219
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,486
It's me.

220
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,287
It's me.

221
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:19,291
I'm your Shancai, Daoming Si.

222
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,104
Daoming Si!

223
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,875
I'm your Shancai.

224
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:37,877
Daoming Si.

225
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:45,885
I will get Yesha.

226
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:49,722
I will get Yesha.

227
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:52,124
Daoming Si!

228
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:22,521
You do? Have we met before?

229
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:26,559
No, I haven't remembered anything.

230
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:27,960
I just...

231
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:32,798
saw a message for me.

232
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,333
It's me.

233
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:36,135
It's me.

234
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,206
I'm your Shancai, Daoming Si.

235
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,077
Daoming Si!

236
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,713
You can't forget about them!

237
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,383
Our balloons,

238
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:27,887
your birthday cookies,

239
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:32,291
the meteor necklace you gave me,

240
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,897
and that strawberry you owe me.

241
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,132
You can't forget them!

242
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:46,172
Come back to me!

243
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:49,475
Come back.

244
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,683
Daoming Si!

245
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,651
Come out, Brave Yesha.

246
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,487
I need you.

247
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,292
Come out.

248
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:24,303
Sir, I wouldn't ask you
if my family wasn't in need.

249
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,905
I'm desperate now.

250
00:23:26,205 --> 00:23:28,474
With the economy being down,

251
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,478
we need money to cover our expenses.

252
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,948
Sir, I'm begging you.

253
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:37,283
Please.

254
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,351
Please?

255
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:43,589
You only sold one car
in the past three months.

256
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:47,760
Your number of sales is the lowest
in the history of the company.

257
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,262
And you are still asking for an advance?

258
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:57,870
Sir, please give me more time.

259
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,038
I've been working really hard.

260
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,974
I've been improving myself
and my sales skills.

261
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:07,479
I've been practicing my sales pitch
with my wife at home.

262
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,381
It's my wife's birthday tomorrow.

263
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,550
We don't need your practicing.

264
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,185
We need you to increase your sales.

265
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:14,720
Understood.

266
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,056
There are so many fingerprints
on that one.

267
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,590
Didn't I just tell you to wipe them off?

268
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,059
Got it.

269
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,260
I'll wipe it again.

270
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:23,362
It will be squeaky clean.

271
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:36,241
Sir...

272
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:37,943
I...

273
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:42,314
My boss told me
to keep an eye on you, Dong.

274
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:45,050
Don't ask for an advance again.

275
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:50,789
One month is all I can give you.

276
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:55,394
I can't help you
if you fail to increase your sales.

277
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,464
Got it. Thank you, sir.

278
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:00,299
Watch your step.

279
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:01,700
Goodbye.

280
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:02,968
Thank you, sir.

281
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:54,279
Cheers.

282
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:09,595
Sir, do you need a cab?

283
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:11,930
What cab?

284
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:14,299
Why would I need a cab?

285
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,935
You know nothing.

286
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,972
Let me tell you, young man.

287
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:26,044
People like me drive a Jaguar every day.

288
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:27,713
You know?

289
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:30,082
Cars like Jaguar...

290
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,316
They are...

291
00:27:32,718 --> 00:27:33,919
Why am I telling you this?

292
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,388
You won't understand. They're expensive.

293
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:37,856
You know nothing.

294
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:41,927
But cops are not kidding
when it comes to drunk driving.

295
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,662
Don't drive after drinking.

296
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:46,632
Don't drink before driving.

297
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:49,535
You'd better call a cab for me.

298
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:06,652
Sorry, my bad, dude.

299
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:09,521
I'm grabbing some money to buy beer.

300
00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:10,556
All good.

301
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,157
It's all good.

302
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:13,158
Sorry.

303
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:19,598
Sir.

304
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:21,867
The cab will be here
in about five minutes.

305
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:23,035
Five minutes.

306
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,903
Okay, just what I wanted.

307
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:27,706
Let's hurry up. One more bottle, okay?

308
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,041
Come on...

309
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:30,175
Be quick.

310
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:31,410
Come on.

311
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:33,612
Beer.

312
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:38,884
<i>I'm not drunk</i>

313
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:45,557
<i>Please don't feel sorry for me</i>

314
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:50,295
<i>The beer I drank</i>

315
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,300
<i>Is hurting my heart</i>

316
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:01,306
I tell you...

317
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,675
I am not drunk.

318
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:06,144
At least I know...

319
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:08,280
where is my house.

320
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,781
Right.

321
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:30,369
Wow, what the hell?

322
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:32,771
The lock has been changed.

323
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:36,108
Open the door.

324
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:40,479
Honey.

325
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,482
Open the door.

326
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:47,219
Honey.

327
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:49,855
Why are you drunk like this?

328
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:51,023
Honey?

329
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,725
Are you okay?

330
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,927
-I got drunk.
-Honey.

331
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:57,562
Let me tell you something.

332
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:02,801
I went to a dinner party with my boss.

333
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,404
You have to know...

334
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,539
that a successful man...

335
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,009
will go to dinner parties with the boss.

336
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:12,978
That's how he climbs up the ladder.

337
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:14,780
There, there.

338
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,315
Honey!

339
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:18,350
Honey!

340
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,988
I'll drink some more.

341
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:24,723
I'll tell you what, I can drink more.

342
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,558
Stop, okay?

343
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:27,826
Honey.

344
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:29,895
Honey, get up.

345
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,596
Get up!

346
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,798
Honey.

347
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:34,933
Dad!

348
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:38,837
-Shancai.
-Listen to me...

349
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:42,307
-Dad.
-Look how drunk your dad is.

350
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,277
-Dad.
-I tell you, I drank too little.

351
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:46,912
-I drank too much.
-Dad.

352
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:50,749
Get up, Dad!

353
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:56,355
-Honey.
-Dad.

354
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:57,456
Honey.

355
00:30:58,557 --> 00:31:00,225
Come on, honey.

356
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:05,263
I am not drunk. Okay?

357
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,032
-Okay.
-Okay, honey.

358
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:09,101
-Let me tell you...
-Okay.

359
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,335
<i>I must be strong.</i>

360
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:12,804
<i>No matter what's happening,
I must be strong.</i>

361
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,640
<i>Be strong for Mom and Dad.</i>

362
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:19,277
<i>Because I am Shancai, strong weed Shancai.</i>

363
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:21,413
-Where is my briefcase?
-I've got it, Dad.

364
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,715
-My briefcase.
-I already got it.

365
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:24,783
She got it!

366
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,322
Is there...

367
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,458
<i>Remember, take good care
of my car and my house.</i>

368
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:37,229
Granny, this is the 28th time you told us.

369
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:38,630
Don't worry.

370
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:41,333
Granny.

371
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,602
Be happy.

372
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,303
You too.

373
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:47,406
Right.

374
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:49,775
We'll all be happy.

375
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:54,746
Okay. It's time to go.

376
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,761
<i>Shancai is afraid of reunions.</i>

377
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:12,230
<i>I'm afraid of leaving.</i>

378
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:35,987
We will stay together forever.

379
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:38,623
Don't worry.

380
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,396
You should get to work now.

381
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,065
Yesha.

382
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:57,008
I'm so happy because of you.
Do you know that?

383
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:05,116
What I know is you're running late.

384
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,852
Go.

385
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:08,687
Go.

386
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:12,911
<i>Right. He's been doing great
at work recently.</i>

387
00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:16,648
His boss really likes him.

388
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:21,252
So he came home very late
because of all the dinner parties.

389
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:23,755
Don't worry.

390
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:27,459
Even if every man
in the world is having an affair,

391
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:30,729
my husband won't have one.

392
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:34,265
Sorry, Mrs. Li.
I got another call coming in.

393
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:35,800
I'm sorry.

394
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:40,305
Hello. This is Shancai's sweet home.

395
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,441
Yesha? Yes.

396
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:45,844
Just a moment. Hang on.

397
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,079
Shancai! It's for you.

398
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:51,383
Hurry! I'm chatting
with someone important.

399
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,518
It's Yesha.

400
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:54,886
Thank you.

401
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:58,590
Hi, Yesha.

402
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:01,760
I'm well.

403
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:03,862
Now?

404
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,731
Okay, see you soon.

405
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,767
Oh, you're done.

406
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,036
Mrs. Li, I'm sorry.

407
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,338
Our Shancai has many
party invitations, too.

408
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:16,041
Yes, she got a lot of friends.
Everyone likes her.

409
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:19,144
Have you visited the new supermarket?

410
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,279
They're doing promotions now.

411
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,947
Buy three, get ten free.

412
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,373
Grandpa and Granny flew
to Canada this morning.

413
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:50,475
Grandpa and Granny?

414
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:55,513
I'm so happy for them.

415
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,116
They have been waiting for over 20 years.

416
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:21,673
You forgot to take it yesterday.

417
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,808
I was answering your phone
the whole night.

418
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:25,477
So you had it.

419
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,180
I'm sorry. Usually, there aren't
many people calling me.

420
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,150
I can't believe they were all calling me
when I didn't have my phone.

421
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:33,718
I'm just kidding.

422
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:35,353
I only got one call.

423
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:42,227
Shancai.

424
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:45,663
I've observed that you always have
your phone with you.

425
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:50,535
When we're working at the cake shop,
you always keep it within your reach.

426
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:54,405
You must be waiting for an important call.

427
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:57,041
No.

428
00:37:57,175 --> 00:37:58,243
Of course you are.

429
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:02,747
I know because I answered the call
that you've been waiting for so long.

430
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:05,416
How is that possible?

431
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,417
Why not?

432
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:07,719
Because...

433
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:10,955
It's nothing.

434
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,026
Okay, I won't tease you anymore.

435
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:28,306
Meizuo called you yesterday.

436
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:32,477
He had something urgent to tell you.

437
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:34,946
Urgent?

438
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,449
Is it about Ximen?

439
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:45,156
So... It's Huaze Lei?

440
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:52,864
What is it?

441
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:00,405
It's a very important matter.

442
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,075
He has news about Daoming Si.

443
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,285
What a pity the news came a bit late.

444
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:18,122
Yesha.

445
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:26,231
Shancai, I'm mad at you.

446
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,666
How could you not tell me about this?

447
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,336
I tell you everything about me.

448
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:33,805
But you didn't tell me something
this important.

449
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:42,380
The truth is I'm not mad at you.

450
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:45,817
I'm mad at myself.

451
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:51,489
I thought I was smart, but I didn't
even notice you were bothered.

452
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:55,393
Yesha, please don't blame yourself.

453
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:58,496
I decided not to tell you.

454
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:01,599
Why?

455
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,504
Because...

456
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:36,935
Shancai.

457
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:40,438
Don't you remember
how we became good friends?

458
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:43,541
That's because we're both brave.

459
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:51,482
Why can't you be brave for yourself
when you can be brave for others?

460
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,466
Let's go.

461
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:11,035
Where?

462
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,704
Just come with me.

463
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:16,808
We haven't finished our drinks.

464
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:19,110
Let's go. Come on.

465
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:27,919
Yes!

466
00:41:35,727 --> 00:41:37,829
Wow. A strike again?

467
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:39,397
It's your turn.

468
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:40,665
I'm bad at this.

469
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:42,266
Yesha, you can play by yourself.

470
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,501
Let me teach you.

471
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:48,506
I'm really bad at it.

472
00:41:48,573 --> 00:41:49,741
Listen to me.

473
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:52,577
Look straight ahead.

474
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:55,580
Don't panic. Don't be afraid.

475
00:41:56,414 --> 00:42:00,051
Imagine those pins are the obstacles
between you and Ah Si.

476
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:04,389
Throw the ball with confidence.

477
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:06,124
Smash the obstacles.

478
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,361
