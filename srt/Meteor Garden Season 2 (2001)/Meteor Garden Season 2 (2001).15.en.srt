1
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,030
Shancai.

2
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:13,767
-Qinghe.
-No work today?

3
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,235
I got someone to cover my shift today.

4
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,303
That's great.

5
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,572
We can finally have a nice chat today.

6
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:19,740
Qinghe.

7
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,009
Qinghe.

8
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,913
Qinghe, do you remember me?

9
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,750
You are...

10
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,351
Don't you recognize me?

11
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,390
I'll give you a little hint.

12
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:41,094
During the morning registration
at Yingde College,

13
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:44,731
there was a poor girl
who was being humiliated.

14
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,001
Then, a hero showed up.

15
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:55,642
This hero solved the girl's problem
and gave her confidence.

16
00:02:56,743 --> 00:03:00,914
From then on, the girl remembered
the figure of the hero in her heart.

17
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:02,849
Figure?

18
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:05,952
Do you remember, Qinghe?

19
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,790
Oh, you must be that hero, right?

20
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:12,225
You're so funny.

21
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,194
That hero is you.

22
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,362
Me?

23
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:17,898
I'm that girl who accepted your money.

24
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:18,832
I'm Mimi.

25
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,600
Mimi.

26
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:24,871
I remember now.

27
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,606
Sorry, I didn't recognize you earlier.

28
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,874
That's okay.

29
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:32,479
My dad said that a true hero helps people
without expecting anything in return.

30
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:39,086
I forgot to say. Please accept
my deepest gratitude.

31
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,087
Thank you.

32
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,690
Qinghe, why didn't you tell me
about that good deed?

33
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,393
Qinghe, this is...

34
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,397
This is my best friend
and my most understanding schoolmate,

35
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:51,732
Shancai.

36
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:57,537
You're that "weed,"
that hardworking virgin.

37
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:01,575
Shancai, the girlfriend
of the handsomest, richest,

38
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,910
and the leader of F4, Daoming Si.

39
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:05,879
I...

40
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,347
I'm so lucky.

41
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:11,418
I met two big shots
the moment I'm in Yingde College.

42
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:15,822
Shancai, may I shake your hands?

43
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,158
Oh, okay.

44
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,463
I'm so lucky. I'm holding Shancai's hand.

45
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,432
I'm so moved that I'm about to cry.

46
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,201
Nice to meet you, too.

47
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:29,970
Mimi.

48
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,037
Oh, Mimi.

49
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:34,775
It's an honor to meet both of you.

50
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,143
The honor is mine.

51
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,479
I believe your hero, Qinghe,
will take good care of you.

52
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,682
I'll do my best to repay your favor.

53
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,751
Oh, you don't have to.

54
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:50,223
Qinghe, I have a tiny problem right now.

55
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,492
Go ahead.

56
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:57,330
Please accept my sincere gratitude
and have dinner with me.

57
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,166
What? Dinner?

58
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,489
Hello, Shancai.

59
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:57,490
Morning.

60
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,572
<i>School is about to start.</i>

61
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,010
<i>Even the air in Yingde College
smells different.</i>

62
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:21,348
<i>Is it because of the absence of F4?</i>

63
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,460
Sorry.

64
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:40,667
Do you like my back-to-school gift?

65
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:44,838
Lei.

66
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,007
Why did you tease me like that?

67
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:51,912
I just want to remind you
of those disasters the F4 had caused.

68
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:55,916
So you will treasure the change.

69
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,889
Don't worry, I'll make my life better.

70
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,930
Why are you still sitting on the floor?

71
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,632
Stand up and chase your happiness.

72
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,847
Frightening me with a frog.

73
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,033
I'm here to apologize.

74
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,136
I'm sorry, I hit you at the airport.

75
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,537
I was too emotional.

76
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:30,510
I want to tell you that I won't give up
whether you like me or not.

77
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:33,446
I'll do everything I can
to bring back your memory.

78
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,086
This is my phone number.

79
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,522
Call me whenever you want.

80
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,995
That's okay if you don't want to call me.

81
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,398
I'll come to see you every day.

82
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:48,321
Boss, 10...

83
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:50,023
10:00 a.m.

84
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,758
Slow down, what's the rush?

85
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:52,692
Yes, sir.

86
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:55,662
I've just received a meeting notice.

87
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,965
The President and department managers
will review your marketing plan.

88
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:11,177
General Manager.

89
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:12,245
General Manager.

90
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:16,049
-General Manager.
-General Manager.

91
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:25,458
Why are you so nervous?

92
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:26,526
Relax.

93
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,228
Yes, sir.

94
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,963
I'm not nervous at all.

95
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,103
-President.
-President.

96
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:39,973
Take your seats.

97
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,814
Let's cut to the chase.

98
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:55,321
We have Manager Ximen here. He will
brief us about his Autumn marketing plan.

99
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:09,636
Morning, everyone.

100
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,873
I don't have to tell you how complicated
marketing is.

101
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:18,912
I have the simplest explanation
for the marketing concept.

102
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,517
Great marketing comes
from sincere attitude.

103
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:36,229
This is the 2002 Autumn marketing plan
that I'll show you this meeting.

104
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:37,697
First, let's see the first slide.

105
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,334
This is our 2002 Autumn report.

106
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:47,273
We can see the difference among seasons
one, two, three, and four is small.

107
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,889
So I believe, in this way,
we can achieve...

108
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:25,612
What?

109
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:29,749
Sir, I'll go with you.

110
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,886
Thank you for your kindness.
But you can't.

111
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,257
Secretary Xu, try your best.

112
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,728
I hope I can visit you every now and then
after I leave this office.

113
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:42,695
But...

114
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,331
<i>Manager Ximen, please go
to the General Manager's office.</i>

115
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:52,338
Face what you have to face.

116
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:04,951
Sir.

117
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,919
That was amazing, Ximen.

118
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:10,657
Sir, you're flattering me.

119
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,692
No, I mean every word I said.

120
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:14,360
It was amazing.

121
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:18,298
No wonder why this morning
the President called me.

122
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:21,768
He said that he read
your whole plan last night.

123
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:23,536
And he loved it.

124
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:24,804
He thought it was great.

125
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:31,311
He was afraid of not being objective
when it comes to his son,

126
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,746
so he asked me to arrange this briefing.

127
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:39,085
He was so nervous about your briefing that
he booked a later flight to Singapore.

128
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:47,427
He saw the satisfied expressions
on the managers' faces halfway through it.

129
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,163
So then he went to catch the plane.

130
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,266
He even called me on the way.

131
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,069
He told me to convey his words to you.

132
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,240
The President told me
to tell you six words.

133
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,812
"Work as hard as you can."

134
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:30,763
Sha, pick up the phone already.

135
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,634
Pick up the phone.

136
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,273
Come on, pick up the phone!

137
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,852
Customers are coming.

138
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,292
Hey. Wipe that table for me.

139
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,608
We'll be late for class, hurry up.

140
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,378
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you for coming.

141
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,321
Here you are, hot coffee.

142
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,559
Sir, please clean the table for me.

143
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,801
You didn't wipe the table.

144
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:51,571
Can't you wipe it by yourself?

145
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:54,740
-What's wrong with you?
-I'm sorry.

146
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:55,808
Please take your seat.

147
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,877
Wiping tables is what the boss does here.

148
00:17:57,944 --> 00:17:59,345
He is bad at wiping tables. I'm sorry.

149
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,213
Please calm down,
and I'll take your order.

150
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,348
What would you like to eat?

151
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,151
-I'll have a hamburger with egg.
-Got it. Coming up.

152
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,588
I'm sorry.

153
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:15,461
What are you doing?

154
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:17,196
You are a jerk.

155
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,397
What do you mean I'm a jerk?

156
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:19,732
You are totally a jerk.

157
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:21,801
How could you take it out
on Ah Lun's customers?

158
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:24,604
Did Ah Lun force Yesha to leave?

159
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:26,973
Or did that customer force her to leave?

160
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,942
Don't you think you're being selfish?

161
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,580
What now? Want to fight?

162
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:37,283
Come on.

163
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,585
Let's see if you have the guts
to vent to me.

164
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,887
Don't take it out
on our breakfast restaurant.

165
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:40,413
Do you know why we are working so hard
at this breakfast restaurant,

166
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:46,085
with all these "Thanks for coming"
and "Welcome" we say every morning?

167
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:59,131
We consider it a real privilege
to see the sunrise every morning.

168
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:05,538
If the three of us can travel
around the world,

169
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:11,343
saying "Good morning" to the sunrise,
that will be our greatest happiness.

170
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:20,086
The three of us made a deal to travel
every corner of the world

171
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:26,625
to see every sunrise and to learn how to
say "Good morning" in every language.

172
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:31,497
To make it come true,

173
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:36,836
Ah Lun set up this restaurant
with his father's insurance compensation.

174
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:44,577
Making a fortune is never our goal.

175
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:48,447
All we want to do is achieve our dream.

176
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,134
I know my words are harsh,

177
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,103
but I'm telling you the truth.

178
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:15,174
I know you don't feel easy
after hearing my words,

179
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:19,678
but we care about you.

180
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:22,882
We don't know how to help you.

181
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:28,087
I drank with you yesterday,
but it didn't work.

182
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:34,593
You have to figure out by yourself
how to make yourself feel better.

183
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,263
Be happy.

184
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:44,770
If you're a tough guy,

185
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,441
you get her back.

186
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,421
Did I say something wrong?

187
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:11,530
It's full tomorrow.

188
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,265
How about the day after tomorrow?

189
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,568
Great, thank you.

190
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:18,537
It's full the day after tomorrow.

191
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:21,707
Why is it always out?

192
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:23,008
It's peak season now.

193
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,844
I don't care if it's peak season.

194
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,012
I didn't mean...

195
00:22:27,313 --> 00:22:30,816
Could you find any available seats
at a later date? Thanks.

196
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:34,186
There's one three days from now.

197
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:36,922
Okay, I'll take it. Can I book it now?

198
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:39,758
No? Why?

199
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,796
40,000 bucks?

200
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,764
Cash only?

201
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,401
Okay, thank you.

202
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,305
40,000.

203
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:08,287
37, 38, 39, 40.

204
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,602
I think that's enough.

205
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,404
That's all we got.

206
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:32,511
I just want to ask you...

207
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:38,984
how to earn 40,000 bucks in two hours?

208
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:44,657
You can't earn 40,000 bucks in two hours.

209
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,226
But...

210
00:23:56,402 --> 00:23:58,570
I lent it to you which means you have
to repay it later.

211
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:01,807
These two are the ones--

212
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:04,376
-Thank you.
-Don't you dare think of

213
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,211
terminating our dream time deposit.

214
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,948
Hey, what are you doing?

215
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,816
You borrowed money,
and now you want to hug my babe?

216
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:12,618
What? What will happen if I hug him?

217
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:14,253
I'll hug her for Ah Si.

218
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,855
-Get lost!
-What's wrong with hugging for Ah Si?

219
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:17,890
You two...

220
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,191
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

221
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:22,328
-Sorry, sir, we're closed.
-We're closed.

222
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:24,229
Young master.

223
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:30,069
Young master, I'm the secretary
of your mother, Mrs. Daoming.

224
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:33,605
She told me to visit you.

225
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:40,079
Young master, I know you must be confused
by my unexpected visit.

226
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,347
Please accept my apology.

227
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,216
She worries about you.

228
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,352
She tried everything
to know where you are.

229
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:48,687
She just wants to meet you.

230
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:55,194
I know you're concerned
about the whereabouts of Miss Yesha.

231
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,832
Miss Yesha hasn't left Taiwan.

232
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:05,671
It's easy for her to locate Miss Yesha.

233
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:07,539
All you need to do is ask her.

234
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,876
Young master, I've told you what she said.

235
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,579
Goodbye. I won't take more of your time.

236
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:15,047
Goodbye.

237
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,585
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you for coming.

238
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,123
"Young master"?

239
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,159
Who are you?

240
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:40,906
Do you feel better today?

241
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,310
We're working on your examination report.

242
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,514
You should stay in bed for a few days.
You need a good rest.

243
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:15,040
-Hi.
-Hi.

244
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:29,822
The staff of this hospital
have no common sense.

245
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,959
How is there no decoration,
not even a single flower in Yesha's room?

246
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:41,166
Besides the lack of common sense,
the doctors here are so ugly.

247
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:44,603
They hit the jackpot for receiving
such a beautiful patient.

248
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,972
Thank God you're here, Sha.

249
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:49,808
I missed you so much.

250
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,043
Me, too.

251
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:54,646
What?

252
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,381
Yes.

253
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:57,583
Yes.

254
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,119
Okay, I'll be there to greet him.

255
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:13,065
Young master, you're finally back.

256
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:14,133
Young master, welcome.

257
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,868
-Young master, welcome.
-Young master, welcome.

258
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,536
I want to meet my mother.

259
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:19,338
-Hurry, guide our madam here.
-Understood.

260
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:34,520
Ah Si.

261
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:36,788
You're finally home.

262
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:40,959
Butler Liu.

263
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,961
Lead your young master to his room
to rest himself.

264
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,630
Understood.
Young master, this way, please.

265
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:45,797
Don't bother.

266
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:52,905
I have one favor to ask.

267
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:58,744
It's easy for us Daoming Family
to find someone.

268
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:02,147
I can find Yesha for you.

269
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,785
Are you sure?

270
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:13,158
I have the daily list
of the people exiting Taiwan.

271
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:17,996
Yesha clearly hasn't left Taiwan.

272
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:23,969
You know what I can do from this, right?

273
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,705
Is it true that Yesha hasn't left yet?

274
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,808
Trust me, Ah Si.

275
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,845
I can definitely get Yesha back for you.

276
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:36,515
But...

277
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,384
there's one condition.

278
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,662
Come back home, Ah Si.

279
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:04,710
I'll come back here when you find Yesha.

280
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:11,416
Deal.

281
00:29:12,718 --> 00:29:14,653
I'll find her in one week.

282
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,191
Deal.

283
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:23,996
I'll visit you in one week.

284
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,082
Yutian.

285
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:47,019
You only have one week.

286
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,284
Sorry, I fell asleep.

287
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:22,087
I was just worried about you.

288
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:24,156
It's good to see you back.
I'm leaving now.

289
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:39,638
We became enemies
because of this red note.

290
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,773
Then from enemies, we became...

291
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:56,288
This box contains a lot of our past.

292
00:30:57,823 --> 00:30:59,558
I've thought about it.

293
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:03,328
Our past is no longer important to you.

294
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,531
But I want you to give it one more try.

295
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:11,503
I'll be relieved if you still decide
to be who you are now

296
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:14,005
after you've seen these memories.

297
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:16,308
Daoming Si.

298
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,810
Could you please take a good look at them?

299
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,715
I'll leave it to you.

300
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,085
Goodbye.

301
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:29,354
Hey.

302
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:35,360
Come in.

303
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:06,291
TAKE CARE

304
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,550
These are your memories.

305
00:32:34,386 --> 00:32:35,720
Those are mine.

306
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:39,591
Shancai.

307
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,094
I just want you to know...

308
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:47,032
that it's never my intention to hurt you.

309
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:54,272
But these memories are everything I have
in my mind.

310
00:32:57,242 --> 00:32:59,044
The only thing I can say to you is...

311
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:04,216
I'm sorry.

312
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:05,817
That is not true.

313
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:08,487
You own everything in this box, too.

314
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:10,322
Daoming Si.

315
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:12,491
You can love what you have now.

316
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:14,893
But you can't deny what happened
in the past.

317
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:19,431
Please try harder, okay?

318
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:24,069
Maybe things in this box
can wake up your memories.

319
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,176
What if they can never be woken up?

320
00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:36,715
Should you wake up from your dream, too?

321
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:46,892
This is not fair.

322
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:58,937
Of course, they'll be forgotten
if you don't open the box.

323
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:02,908
Maybe you won't regret
if you forget about them.

324
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:06,678
But at least you can
try to get to know me again.

325
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,249
Hello, Daoming Si, I'm Shancai.

326
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:12,817
Shancai is a kind of weed.

327
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,886
A kind of weed that will stand straight up

328
00:34:14,953 --> 00:34:17,889
even if it's stomped onto the ground.

329
00:34:17,956 --> 00:34:21,726
I'm a person who never surrenders
to unfairness easily.

330
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:25,597
That's all for today. See you tomorrow.

331
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,245
<i>Ah Si has lost his memory for now.</i>

332
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,249
<i>Who knows if he will
remember everything someday?</i>

333
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:21,820
Shancai.

334
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:26,358
A lot of tomorrows are waiting for you
in this world.

335
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:35,266
Lei is right.

336
00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:38,803
Maybe Daoming Si will remember
everything tomorrow.

337
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:44,009
Daoming Si will remember everything
tomorrow.

338
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:19,944
Wait.

339
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,014
Let me go through it again.

340
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,317
You fell in love with him.

341
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:28,520
Ah Xing fell in love with you.

342
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,424
You decided to back out
because of a girl called Shancai.

343
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:38,396
Yesha.

344
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:42,100
I don't understand
why you have to do this to yourself.

345
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:48,606
Ah Xing and Shancai
would remain a happy couple

346
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,043
if the accident didn't happen.

347
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,748
Shancai is the one who suffers the most.

348
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:06,825
Will Ah Xing be happy
if you give him back to her now?

349
00:37:08,193 --> 00:37:10,095
He has forgotten Shancai long ago.

350
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:13,798
He loves you and you love him.

351
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:16,201
You're torturing everyone now.

352
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:27,912
But, one day, Ah Xing will be in pain
for loving me right?

353
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:36,688
Miss Yesha.

354
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:39,491
Your doctor is waiting for you
in his room.

355
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:49,634
Miss Yesha.

356
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:55,907
The examination report shows
that you have an autoimmune disease.

357
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:59,110
It's called multiple sclerosis.

358
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:03,281
Multiple sclerosis?

359
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:07,452
What does it mean, doctor?

360
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,156
It's a very rare disease.

361
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:14,325
The symptoms are complex and various.

362
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,129
It might damage your nerve endings
and muscles.

363
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,398
It may cause atrophy or paralysis.

364
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:24,202
It may damage your brain nerves
or your eyesight.

365
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:28,640
The symptoms may differ greatly.

366
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:32,544
Due to the limitation
of current medical technologies,

367
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:38,583
bone marrow transplant
is your only choice.

368
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:44,022
You mean...

369
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,258
I'll be lying in bed forever?

370
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:50,195
Or blind?

371
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:52,430
Well...

372
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:56,234
Doctor, if a bone marrow transplant
will fix her,

373
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:58,303
I'll donate mine to Yesha.

374
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:03,575
The problem is,
it's hard to find a compatible one.

375
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:05,977
Even if she receives the treatment,

376
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:10,148
her chance of recovery is fairly low.

377
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,822
When will I be blind?

378
00:39:19,424 --> 00:39:21,292
When will I not be able to move?

379
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,662
How much time do I have left?

380
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:29,601
Considering your increasing symptoms

381
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:32,036
and your complications,

382
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:34,405
I think...

383
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:36,507
you have about three months.

384
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:47,345
Why did you get up?

385
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:51,082
Sha.

386
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,117
I'm going to leave the hospital.

387
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:56,654
-Yesha.
-I don't want to waste my life.

388
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,457
Sha, no one knows me better than you.

389
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:02,393
I'm running out of time.

390
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,796
How could I stay here?

391
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,932
I'm going to travel the world.

392
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:11,469
I'm going to see every corner
of the world.

393
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:14,138
Remember them.

394
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,174
Paint them.

395
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,116
Before I go blind,

396
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,719
before I can't move...

397
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,255
I'm going to live my life to the fullest.

398
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:36,494
Sha, I'm going to leave the hospital.

399
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:40,999
Okay.

400
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:44,435
We'll leave tomorrow.

401
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,772
We'll travel the world tomorrow.

402
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:51,642
Sha, you're the best.

403
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,345
You're the best.

404
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:11,763
Ma'am.

405
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:17,902
So the reason why it's so hard to find out
who Miss Yesha is,

406
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:20,905
she isn't an ordinary person.

407
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:27,945
So I assume everything
is under your control now?

408
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:30,048
Yes, ma'am.

409
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:38,356
Daoming Si!

410
00:43:36,514 --> 00:43:39,150
<i>Daoming Si, I miss you so much.</i>

411
00:43:39,484 --> 00:43:40,918
<i>I really miss you so much.</i>

412
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,888
<i>You're right in front of me,</i>

413
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:46,757
<i>but why do I miss you more?</i>

414
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:32,957
