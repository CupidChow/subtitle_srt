1
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:20,173
<i>The bright sun is setting</i>

2
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:29,650
<i>The lambs are going home</i>

3
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:52,372
<i>The little lambs are following their mom</i>

4
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,907
What can we do for you?

5
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:56,109
-Don't be so rude. What are you doing?
-What... are you doing?

6
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,045
-Don't lay your hands on us.
-You...

7
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,113
Let go of her.

8
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,682
Let go...

9
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,484
What are you doing?

10
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,357
You made me worry.

11
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,192
Go home with me.

12
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,362
Who are you? Why does he need
to go home with you?

13
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,538
"David Daoming.

14
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,273
Chinese-American."

15
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:27,874
You're his...

16
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,644
She's your mother.
You don't have any impression of her?

17
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,780
I never expected you
to be the son of a gangster.

18
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,891
Thank you for taking care of David.

19
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,262
David, let's go.

20
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,366
-No.
-You...

21
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:55,435
You're too willful!

22
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,238
Look at how you're degrading yourself.

23
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,208
Go back to New York with me
and get treated.

24
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,144
New York?

25
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,447
Aren't I from Taipei?

26
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:14,387
After you've regained your memory,
we can talk about going back to Taiwan.

27
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,423
I've already made arrangements.

28
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,058
Why should I follow your arrangements?

29
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,227
Because I'm your mother.

30
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,096
Ah Xing.

31
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:27,968
Even though she's very rude,
she's your mother after all.

32
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,303
She's the only clue you have now.

33
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:33,073
Don't you want to find yourself?

34
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,475
Then you must go home with her.

35
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,512
I believe
the so-called arrangements she made

36
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,614
will help you regain your memories.

37
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,215
It must be beneficial to you.

38
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:56,029
You would scare him this way.

39
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,833
He's very insecure right now.

40
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,068
The more you force him,
the farther he'll run.

41
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,104
Let me do it.

42
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,689
-Hey, where is Ah Xing?
-Hello.

43
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,057
Ah Xing is over there.

44
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,992
-Thank you.
-Not at all.

45
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,831
How is it going? Have you finished yet?

46
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,319
I told you, you would find yourself soon.

47
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:53,620
Congratulations, Ah Xing.

48
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,461
If they say I'm David,
then should I really be called David?

49
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:08,001
If they say I should go back to New York,
then should I really go there?

50
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,541
I know this is not a good feeling, but...

51
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:19,012
Do you need me to do anything for you?

52
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:23,683
If you don't want to go
with your mother now, I can...

53
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:26,553
I still have to go back.

54
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:31,892
Even though it feels unfamiliar...

55
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,763
and uncomfortable.

56
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:41,868
She's really a bit...

57
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:43,236
unfriendly.

58
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,805
But...

59
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:50,310
it should be safest
to be with your mother.

60
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,046
At least,

61
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,849
a mother won't murder her own son, right?

62
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,721
She'll surely help you find yourself.

63
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,460
When you do,
remember to give me a call and tell me.

64
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,603
Go.

65
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,339
God and Longshan Temple will protect you.

66
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:27,580
Go.

67
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,183
You would find out who you are soon.

68
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:55,909
This is for you.

69
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,955
I don't know if I should
hate you or thank you,

70
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:12,993
but...

71
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,099
I know.

72
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,660
Come visit us when you have time.

73
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:07,280
Ah Xing.

74
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,949
Remember our star.

75
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,388
Which tie would you like, sir?

76
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:52,659
Which suit would you like, sir?

77
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,540
After you receive treatment,
you will slowly remember many things.

78
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,344
However, let me give you
some important reminders.

79
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,713
First.

80
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,716
You can't be friends
with poor and lowly people.

81
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:19,385
Second.

82
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,588
I'll set the rules.

83
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,456
Just follow them.

84
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,391
Third.

85
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,660
Before you regain your memories,

86
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:31,164
I got you some bodyguards for your safety.

87
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:35,568
No matter where you want to go,
the bodyguards must follow you.

88
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,237
Fourth.

89
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:41,074
I'll let you handle
our business in New York.

90
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:46,679
So after we go back to New York tomorrow,
you must assume your position immediately.

91
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,782
These are the so-called
good arrangements you made?

92
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:53,453
Of course.

93
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:57,724
Then I have a few questions for you.

94
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,892
Let's eat first.

95
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,393
You can ask your questions in the future.

96
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:16,676
May I ask...

97
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,414
Is this how we've always eaten before?

98
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:25,385
Are there not enough dishes?

99
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,820
We can order more if you want.

100
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:30,790
I mean...

101
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,493
Don't we chat when we eat?

102
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,497
Chat?

103
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,166
Why should we chat while eating?

104
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:51,644
There's no need for that.

105
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,981
I want to know my Chinese name.

106
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:57,984
I told you.

107
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:58,985
Your name is David.

108
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,222
I'm Taiwanese. I should have
a Chinese name, right?

109
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,290
You don't need to know.

110
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:05,925
Why?

111
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,027
If I say you don't need to know,
you don't,

112
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,670
because you won't be back
in Taiwan temporarily.

113
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:22,775
Then do I have any siblings?

114
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,378
Your sister is in New York.

115
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:26,980
How about my dad?

116
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,782
He's in New York.

117
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:32,919
Then where did I graduate?

118
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:33,953
What was my major?

119
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,288
Why did I come to Spain?

120
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,638
I don't need to rest. I want answers.

121
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,039
Why won't you answer my questions?

122
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:54,307
Why?

123
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:05,285
I just don't want you to be too impatient.

124
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,786
You want to know everything,

125
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:08,855
yet you might not be able
to take all the information in.

126
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,090
The doctor said
that would be counter-intuitive.

127
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:12,425
Do you understand?

128
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,396
Listen to me.

129
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:11,451
We're going back to New York tomorrow.

130
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:13,986
Have you done everything I told you to?

131
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:17,023
<i>Yes, it's all been taken care of.</i>

132
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:21,294
<i>All the things related to the past
has been removed from Daoming Si's room.</i>

133
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:25,331
<i>Are you sure there's no trace left?</i>

134
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:26,799
<i>Yes.</i>

135
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:29,235
<i>Very good.</i>

136
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:30,803
<i>Remember.</i>

137
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,605
<i>Inform everyone.</i>

138
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,073
<i>After Ah Si goes back,</i>

139
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,809
<i>we have to implement the plan
to change him completely.</i>

140
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,646
No matter what he asks you,
say you don't know anything.

141
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,750
If there are any calls for him,
block them all.

142
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:45,318
<i>Yes.</i>

143
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:46,586
Remember.

144
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,187
Any call.

145
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:49,555
<i>Yes.</i>

146
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:02,295
Can I see my passport?

147
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:19,305
Hello. Good afternoon.

148
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,674
-Hello, my friend!
-How are you?

149
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,509
I'm very good.

150
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,212
-How nice!
-Yes.

151
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,413
It is hard, right?

152
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,548
Yes.

153
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:30,750
Good.

154
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,553
-Okay.
-I'll start from here to help you.

155
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,588
-Yes.
-Okay.

156
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,256
Okay.

157
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,810
You don't seem to be in a good mood.

158
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,714
Am I? Don't mind me.

159
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:05,251
All right. I'll mind my own business.

160
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:16,529
Ah Xing looks quite handsome in a suit.

161
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,833
You're crazy.
When have you seen him in a suit?

162
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,835
Now.

163
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,837
Now?

164
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,978
Ah Xing, why are you back?

165
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,481
I don't know.

166
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,383
You don't know?

167
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,852
Didn't you go back to New York
with your mom?

168
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:44,724
I can't go back to New York
with that person.

169
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,360
I can only trust what I remember now.

170
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,961
"That person"?

171
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:50,463
You mean your mother?

172
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,798
-What did she do?
-She locked me up.

173
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:55,635
She said that she wants to change me
into a different person.

174
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,436
How can that be?

175
00:18:58,604 --> 00:18:59,705
I don't know.

176
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:01,540
I only know...

177
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,043
that if I want to know who I am,

178
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,545
I can only find the answers myself

179
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:09,915
and not rely on who other people say I am
or what I should do next.

180
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,417
That's why I escaped.

181
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:12,852
Great escape.

182
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,354
I knew it.
They don't look like good people.

183
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:17,223
But there's nothing to fear. I'm here.

184
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,959
Even if they come for you,
they can't do anything to you.

185
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,395
She's your mother.

186
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,364
Why would a mother change
her son into a different person?

187
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:26,799
That's right.

188
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,268
Then what do you plan to do now?

189
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:32,905
I want to go back to Taipei.

190
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,508
Maybe if I go back to Taipei,

191
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:38,978
I'll remember everything.

192
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,382
He's in this condition right now.

193
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:45,451
Can you go back there on your own?

194
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:46,786
Sha.

195
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:49,755
I'll go back with you.

196
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,857
Yesha.

197
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:53,292
I'm responsible for this.

198
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,362
I have a responsibility
to help Ah Xing find himself.

199
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:34,500
Shancai.

200
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,302
We should go to the airport.

201
00:20:58,357 --> 00:20:59,658
Who's that?

202
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:00,993
Don't draw randomly.

203
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,961
Then who's that?

204
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:04,396
Tell me. Who's that? Why is he there?

205
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:05,331
Why?

206
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,501
-Hello.
-Hello.

207
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:43,435
Good afternoon.

208
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,912
-Do you have any check-in luggage?
-No.

209
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:59,485
Do you want a window seat
or an aisle seat?

210
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:00,719
-Smoking?
-It doesn't matter.

211
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,188
-Non-smoking?
-It doesn't matter.

212
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,389
We are in a hurry.

213
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:07,860
Calm down. There is time.
We are not waiting for anyone,

214
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:09,361
only you.

215
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:11,096
Please hurry.

216
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,034
You can speak Spanish?

217
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,371
Did I speak Spanish earlier?

218
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:24,476
Shancai, I believe that Ah Si
would not easily compromise,

219
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,445
no matter where he is.

220
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:29,782
I've already thought about it.

221
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:31,984
If I don't compromise first,

222
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,520
I don't know how much that moron
will suffer again because of me.

223
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,823
So I really lost this time.

224
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,227
I'll get going, Jing.

225
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:42,494
I wish you well.

226
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,677
Take care.

227
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:00,579
You, too.

228
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:14,827
Let's go over there and check-in.

229
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,100
<i>Goodbye, Barcelona.</i>

230
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,136
<i>Goodbye, Daoming Si.</i>

231
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:30,743
Zhuang.

232
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:33,112
You can't find Ah Si.

233
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,382
Didn't he go back to New York?

234
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:40,286
You mean Ah Si's not in New York now?

235
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,655
Zhuang, no, let me confirm again.

236
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:45,024
Ah Si's really not in New York now, right?

237
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:50,062
Zhuang, we'll let you know
if we have any news.

238
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:51,130
All right, bye.

239
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,532
Zhuang said Ah Si's not in New York.

240
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:55,534
Didn't Ah Si's mom say that...

241
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,204
What exactly happened?

242
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:01,206
If Ah Si's really not in New York,

243
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,208
it's impossible
that Zhuang's unaware of it.

244
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:10,616
We were almost fooled by Ah Si's mom.

245
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,219
You mean

246
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:17,356
Ah Si's mom just wanted to separate him
and Shancai through this opportunity?

247
00:24:21,694 --> 00:24:23,128
Then where exactly is Ah Si?

248
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:24,463
What should we do now?

249
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:27,866
<i>Promise me.</i>

250
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:31,870
If you get lost, just stay where you are.

251
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:33,906
I'll surely come back for you. All right?

252
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:34,807
Okay.

253
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:41,146
I can't go.

254
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:43,382
He told me to stay at the original place
and wait for him.

255
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:44,883
That's what he said.

256
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,185
How could I have forgotten?

257
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:48,487
I can't leave Barcelona.

258
00:25:37,403 --> 00:25:39,138
So this is Taiwan.

259
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:43,609
It's my first time here.

260
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:50,082
But I want to go back to Barcelona.

261
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:52,151
Ah Xing.

262
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,053
You had a hard time escaping to Taiwan.

263
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,221
Now you want to go back to Barcelona?

264
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:57,856
Do you like plane rides that much?

265
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:00,392
I don't...

266
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:04,063
feel anything in this place.

267
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,398
I should go back to Barcelona.

268
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,134
Who was the one who said,

269
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:12,771
"If I want to know who I am,
I can only find the answers myself."

270
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:17,810
Actually, like you,
Taipei is also very unfamiliar to me.

271
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,545
That's why I'm so excited.

272
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,680
Why don't you be like me?

273
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,684
Just treat it as a stopover
and get to know Taipei again.

274
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,720
Treat it like it's your first time here.

275
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,622
Forgot your amnesia first.

276
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:35,160
Maybe, by chance,
your memories would come back to find you.

277
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:37,629
Have you decided?

278
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,897
Then follow me.

279
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:41,166
Do whatever I do, okay?

280
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,835
Close your eyes first.

281
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,204
Raise your head.

282
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:47,539
Open our arms.

283
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,175
Let's feel Taipei.

284
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:55,013
Do you feel it?

285
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:57,616
It's wet.

286
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,387
The air is thick.

287
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:05,824
The cars are in a hurry.

288
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,294
Didn't you say
the stars would provide direction?

289
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:12,364
There are no stars in Taipei.

290
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:14,099
No stars?

291
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,834
Look.

292
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,070
You're right.

293
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,905
I don't see "Brave Yesha", too.

294
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:23,008
I told you I wanted to go back
to Barcelona.

295
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:26,278
Why are you throwing a fit?

296
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,514
How can there be no stars?

297
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,049
They say stars exist forever.

298
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:33,919
That means
the stars are always in the sky.

299
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:40,325
You might not be able to see them
because of the fog or light pollution.

300
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,294
You have to wait patiently.

301
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,963
When the fog above you dissipates,

302
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:47,799
when the light pollution recedes,

303
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,502
the stars would appear.

304
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,906
Then Ah Xing can find his way home.

305
00:27:57,643 --> 00:27:59,011
Are you trying to appease a child?

306
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:00,612
Don't look down on me.

307
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,682
Someday, I'll make a book
with my famous lines.

308
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:07,419
"Philosopher Yesha's Famous Quotes."

309
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,258
Also, the best thing about civilization
is that it's complete with information.

310
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:15,761
We may not have stars, but we have maps.

311
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:22,534
And the phone Sha provided.

312
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:29,608
Sha called us
and said a friend is coming over.

313
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:32,344
So I cleaned up a bit.

314
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:36,448
But it's impossible for old houses
to be clean no matter what you do.

315
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,817
It's fine. You even have a yard.

316
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:39,952
It feels nice.

317
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,087
Come.

318
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:46,091
Come.

319
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:47,459
Here we are.

320
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:49,895
There's a sofa, a bed.

321
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,633
What do you think? Will it do?

322
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,134
-It's great. Thank you.
-All right.

323
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:57,803
You can rest then.

324
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,638
I just live in the next alley.

325
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:01,306
Call me if you need anything.

326
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:03,108
-Okay. Good night.
-Okay.

327
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:09,147
I heard he lost his memories,
just like in the television series.

328
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:11,883
Yes, because of a car accident.

329
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:15,887
Okay. You can rest.

330
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,723
-Okay.
-Bye.

331
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:24,696
What do you think? Nice, right?

332
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:29,067
There's an awful smell.

333
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:32,037
Sha prepared this for us,
yet you're complaining.

334
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:34,840
There's only one bed.

335
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:38,744
It's mine because I'm a girl.

336
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:41,947
And this is your hometown.
You're the local, I'm the visitor.

337
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:43,749
You should be nice to visitors.

338
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:45,217
Also, the bed is so small.

339
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:46,852
You won't be comfortable in it.

340
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:48,287
And...

341
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:50,956
Why do you have to say that much?
I didn't say I was going to get it.

342
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:33,291
Good morning.

343
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,034
What are you doing?

344
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:45,203
I'm thinking.

345
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:49,674
Longshan Temple.

346
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:54,579
Longshan Temple's amulet.

347
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,448
This is the first clue.

348
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:57,849
Let's go to Longshan Temple today.

349
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:05,524
The second clue is the person
who says that she's your mom.

350
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,494
Looks quite rich.

351
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:13,732
She looks so arrogant

352
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,470
and has a lot of suit-wearing friends.

353
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:21,473
What else?

354
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:26,511
That's right. The third clue.

355
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:28,847
She says your name is David Daoming.

356
00:32:29,214 --> 00:32:32,784
Usually, people named David
are spoiled and an only child.

357
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:35,787
Who says so?

358
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:37,322
I say so.

359
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:40,058
That's my experience
from seeing the world.

360
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:45,897
Fourth clue.

361
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:49,201
You can speak Spanish.

362
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:52,204
Why can you speak Spanish?

363
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:56,675
Why do you have that expression
on your face?

364
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,143
Think about it.

365
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:03,582
For example, maybe you've stayed
in Spain for a long time.

366
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:05,917
Or...

367
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:08,086
You were a Spanish major.

368
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:10,789
Or...

369
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:13,391
You have a Spanish girlfriend.

370
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:17,963
But I don't think
Spanish women would like you.

371
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,398
What do you mean?

372
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:26,605
They won't be interested
in an innocent boy who didn't do anything

373
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,406
after he spent a night
with a beautiful girl.

374
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,108
What innocent boy?

375
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,044
I'm a "gentleman."

376
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:36,248
An innocent boy, indeed.

377
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:40,685
It's because only innocent boys
would be in a hurry to defend themselves

378
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,989
and blush, too.

379
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:45,123
I...

380
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:48,360
I'm not blushing.

381
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,435
Why did you draw Taipei so badly?

382
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:06,044
So your impression of Taipei
is that it's beautiful?

383
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:07,345
Maybe...

384
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:09,614
you have beautiful memories here.

385
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:13,718
I hope so.

386
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:18,356
So we need to be more aggressive
in finding those beautiful memories.

387
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,525
Think about it.
What other clues do we have?

388
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,565
This.

389
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:28,667
Turns out it's with you.

390
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,236
I thought you left it at the hospital.

391
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:34,172
This ring is key,

392
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:36,741
because you went crazy
when you saw it in the hospital.

393
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:38,076
Do you remember?

394
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:39,978
You almost killed me.

395
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:45,483
I felt a mysterious feeling
towards the ring at that time.

396
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:51,890
But now, I don't seem to feel it anymore.

397
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,564
Let me think.

398
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:03,134
A girl's ring.

399
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,040
Her hand's quite slim.

400
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,577
She doesn't seem to be
a materialistic girl.

401
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:16,414
Who is she to you?

402
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:19,718
It's definitely not your mother's.

403
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,386
She won't wear this kind of ring.

404
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,856
I heard I have a sister
who lives in New York.

405
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:26,925
Then it's more impossible
for it to be hers.

406
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:29,194
Why would you wear your sister's ring
while traveling?

407
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:34,633
When you woke up,
you kept saying, "original place."

408
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,468
What "original place"?

409
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:38,670
Original place...

410
00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:51,182
I can't remember.

411
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:52,584
Don't rush.

412
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,285
Take it slow.

413
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:56,921
-I don't know what "original place" is.
-Don't rush.

414
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,590
What original place is that?

415
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:01,326
Why?

416
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:04,496
My head hurts.

417
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:17,842
<i>Do you feel it? Daoming Si.</i>

418
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:19,978
<i>I listened to you this time.</i>

419
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:21,479
<i>I'm not going anywhere.</i>

420
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,082
<i>I'm just waiting for you
at the original place.</i>

421
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:25,884
<i>Do you feel it?</i>

422
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:44,402
If you don't want to smile,
why do you force yourself?

423
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,506
Am I? Does it look forced?

424
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:49,941
It's fine.

425
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:00,385
Shancai.

426
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:04,923
Meizuo and I are going back.

427
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:07,559
Are you going back to Taiwan?

428
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,427
We'll go to New York first,
then go back to Taiwan.

429
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:11,563
Ah Si's mom knows
he got lost in Barcelona,

430
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:12,831
yet she's not doing anything.

431
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,232
We're a bit worried.

432
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:16,134
So we've decided to split up.

433
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,536
You and Lei stay here
and wait for updates.

434
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:20,605
Meizuo and I are going back
to Taiwan to check.

435
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,807
We'll contact you immediately
if we have anything.

436
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:24,843
Shancai.

437
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,444
You have to take care of yourself.

438
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:27,812
Don't let us worry.

439
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:30,749
I will.

440
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,685
Ximen. Meizuo.

441
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:35,653
Thank you for understanding me.

442
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:37,756
Don't worry.

443
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:39,324
From now on,

444
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,192
I'll be like a weed.

445
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,728
I won't go crazy anymore.

446
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,564
That's the Shancai I know.

447
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:49,501
Even though we shouldn't touch
a friend's wife,

448
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:51,236
I really want to hug you.

449
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:03,915
Lei, why are you standing there?

450
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:05,283
Join us.

451
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:13,958
LONGSHAN TEMPLE

452
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:26,971
Excuse me.

453
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:31,776
May I ask if this is Longshan Temple?

454
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:34,279
Yes, it is. It's been here for a long time
and it's very famous.

455
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:37,315
-Are you here to worship?
-Yes, it's my first time.

456
00:38:37,382 --> 00:38:41,519
I see. Usually, you have
to bring fruits here.

457
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:45,924
Regarding the candles,
you can buy them over there.

458
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:48,893
Thank you.

459
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:11,249
This is really famous.

460
00:39:11,316 --> 00:39:13,551
No one would remember
even if you came here before,

461
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:16,020
but don't worry. We have other clues.

462
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:17,522
Really?

463
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:22,894
A ring that's not mine.

464
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:25,530
An original place we know nothing of.

465
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:27,799
Aside from these,

466
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,235
what else can prove who I am?

467
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:02,767
Ah Xing.

468
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:10,375
Are you asleep?

469
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:18,549
It's good if you're asleep.

470
00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:24,055
There are some things
that I can only say when you're asleep.

471
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,194
I want to tell you

472
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,398
that I'm sorry.

473
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:37,902
I'm really sorry.

474
00:40:46,244 --> 00:40:47,478
I'm sorry.

475
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,183
I'm really sorry.

476
00:42:00,785 --> 00:42:02,053
I got this for you yesterday.

477
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,422
I think it's really effective.

478
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:07,658
That's why you survived
such a major car accident.

479
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,896
You gave me yours, so I got you one.

480
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:13,531
I hope you can go home safely.

481
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:40,224
What's the matter?

482
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,630
I forgot how to tie my shoelaces.

483
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,610
Why can't I even remember that?

484
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:01,546
-Ah Xing.
-Why?

485
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,581
-Ah Xing.
-Tell me. What exactly happened to me?

486
00:43:03,648 --> 00:43:05,149
Why don't I remember anything?

487
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:06,417
Tell me!

488
00:43:06,484 --> 00:43:07,485
Why?

489
00:43:07,552 --> 00:43:09,420
Tell me. Why?

490
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:14,592
Ah Xing.

491
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:16,461
Ah Xing.

492
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:20,798
Ah Xing.

493
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,433
Ah Xing.

494
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:24,102
Ah Xing.

495
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:29,440
Ah Xing.

496
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:38,716
Ah Xing.

497
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:44,956
Ah Xing.

498
