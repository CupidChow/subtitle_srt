1
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:18,031
Daoming Si.

2
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:31,945
This moron has such good taste.

3
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:36,450
He knows such an elegant place.

4
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:39,853
All right.

5
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:41,855
I'll give him ten points for that.

6
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:47,160
However, he left me here alone
to wait for him.

7
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,329
I'll deduct ten points.

8
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,768
So, to sum it all up, the total is...

9
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:56,570
fifty-five points.

10
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,322
<i>Hi, this is Daoming Si.</i>

11
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:16,690
<i>I can't answer the phone now.</i>

12
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:17,724
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

13
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:19,860
Moron, you only have 20 points left.

14
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,161
Call me back soon.

15
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,475
Did something happen to him?

16
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,849
He must be playing a prank on me.

17
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,351
That must be it.

18
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,325
I'll give you another ten minutes.

19
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,227
I'll deduct your points
until there's nothing left.

20
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,789
Daoming Si, are you playing a prank on me?

21
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:57,858
Show yourself to me now.

22
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,434
All right, you win.

23
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,537
I am really scared now.

24
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:13,506
Show yourself now.

25
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,645
Daoming Si!

26
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,022
Daoming Si!

27
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,360
Daoming Si!

28
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,843
<i>Hi, this is Daoming Si.</i>

29
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,244
<i>I can't answer the phone now.</i>

30
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:52,312
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

31
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:02,789
<i>No, something's definitely wrong.</i>

32
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:06,493
<i>Even if he's playing a prank on me,
he would never...</i>

33
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:08,862
<i>What should I do?</i>

34
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:10,530
<i>What should I do?</i>

35
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:21,608
MEIZUO, TEACHER

36
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,343
TENTANG JING

37
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,915
CALLING JING

38
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:04,818
You moron...

39
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,545
<i>I'm so flustered.</i>

40
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,114
<i>I've never been so flustered before.</i>

41
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:36,950
<i>I've been given a red card by F4 before.</i>

42
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,020
<i>I've been evicted by the landlord
with nowhere to go.</i>

43
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:43,556
<i>Even with the mean things
Daoming Si's mom did to me,</i>

44
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,593
<i>I've never been so flustered.</i>

45
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:50,797
<i>All those times I've always felt</i>

46
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,399
<i>that he'll be right in front of me</i>

47
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,567
<i>to handle all the problems</i>

48
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:55,769
<i>no matter what happens.</i>

49
00:08:58,438 --> 00:08:59,939
<i>But this time,</i>

50
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:04,911
<i>somehow I feel that Daoming Si
is not the one in front of me,</i>

51
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,313
<i>but a mass of darkness instead.</i>

52
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,771
Shancai!

53
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,440
Jing!

54
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:15,949
I'm sorry.

55
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,418
Yes, please handle that project.

56
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,653
I may have to take a leave for two days.

57
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:22,522
Thank you.

58
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:24,157
I'll make it up to you.

59
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:25,725
Thank you, bye.

60
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,096
Jing, I'm so sorry.

61
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,698
I've disturbed your work.

62
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,399
Why are you sorry?

63
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,068
I have to thank you instead.

64
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,937
I've really been so busy recently.

65
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:43,109
When I encounter problems at work,
I often think of you guys.

66
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:44,911
Good thing I can come here for a break.

67
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,379
Or else I really want

68
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,348
to leave everything behind
and go back to Taiwan.

69
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,320
Jing, is it possible
that he returned to Taiwan by himself?

70
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:58,758
It's impossible for him to return
to Taiwan alone for no reason.

71
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,460
Based on his personality,

72
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,662
how can he possibly
leave you alone like this?

73
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:04,264
Who says it's not possible?

74
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,099
Am I not alone right now?

75
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,868
Don't be mad.

76
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:13,139
The Ah Si I know
won't leave you alone like this.

77
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,443
Maybe he's currently preparing
some surprise for you.

78
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:19,913
Surprise?

79
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,049
Jing, I remember something.

80
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,005
That's strange. Where's the ring?

81
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,176
Oh, miss, it's you!

82
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,246
Has your boyfriend given you the ring yet?

83
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:54,414
I am really sorry.

84
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,517
I didn't want to sell it to him,
but he insisted.

85
00:11:57,584 --> 00:12:01,321
And I think it will bring bad luck.
I am really sorry,

86
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:02,722
but he insisted.

87
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,124
What did he say?

88
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:09,229
He said there's a legend about the ring.

89
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:15,268
<i>That ring is part of a pair.</i>

90
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,737
<i>However, the other one is gone.</i>

91
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:22,408
<i>They say that if you didn't wait
for the other one,</i>

92
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,877
<i>the person who bought the remaining ring</i>

93
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:28,047
<i>will experience bad things.</i>

94
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,918
<i>So the shopkeeper</i>

95
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,953
<i>has always been reluctant
to sell this ring.</i>

96
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:35,822
<i>However,</i>

97
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:49,168
<i>Ah Si didn't listen to him yesterday.</i>

98
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,804
<i>He insisted to buy the ring.</i>

99
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,657
He asked me to come here
after he bought the ring.

100
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:13,660
Why did he ask me to come here?

101
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,863
Why did he insist to buy that ring?

102
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,333
Why did I like that ring?

103
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:23,670
Bad things.

104
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,172
Goodness.

105
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,241
Something really happened to him!

106
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,043
Don't worry. Let's call the police first.

107
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,578
-I'll grab my phone in the car.
-I have a phone.

108
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:41,187
AH SI

109
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:46,592
AH SI

110
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,267
This seemed to be the letter
Lei gave Daoming Si at the airport.

111
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:01,908
What's the matter?

112
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,276
What did Lei say?

113
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,813
"Ah Si.

114
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,283
You must be very thankful
that we're not around to disturb you..."

115
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:15,888
<i>I can almost feel how happy you both are.</i>

116
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:18,925
<i>Being able to love each other</i>

117
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,427
<i>is very precious, indeed.</i>

118
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:25,832
<i>So it deserves a lot of blessings.</i>

119
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:30,870
<i>There's a legend regarding
St. Paul's Cathedral</i>

120
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:33,406
<i>located in the outskirts of Barcelona.</i>

121
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:36,376
<i>According to the legend,</i>

122
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,278
<i>it's a sacred temple of love.</i>

123
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:42,882
<i>Lovers who make vows in that place</i>

124
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,918
<i>will get the blessings of angels</i>

125
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,286
<i>and will obtain eternal happiness.</i>

126
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,158
<i>I once hoped</i>

127
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,527
<i>that Jing and I</i>

128
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,263
<i>can get such a blessing.</i>

129
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,100
<i>That's why...</i>

130
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,303
<i>I stayed in Barcelona for a couple of days</i>

131
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,807
<i>when I left France last time.</i>

132
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:10,943
<i>I asked Jing to meet me there.</i>

133
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,580
<i>That was my last hope.</i>

134
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,289
"However, I waited
in front of the cathedral

135
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,425
for one day and one night.

136
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:27,593
She never came.

137
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,630
Ah Si.

138
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,299
Can you help me fulfill this legend?

139
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,969
Best wishes for you and Shancai."

140
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,946
Turns out he wanted to...

141
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:55,588
Moron, you're so stupid.

142
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:57,790
Just say what you want to say.

143
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,659
It doesn't matter where we are.

144
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:04,096
Daoming Si, you're so stupid.

145
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:33,559
HUAZE LEI

146
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:44,036
Hello, Shancai.

147
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,741
You must have said yes
to Ah Si's proposal, right?

148
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,056
Don't be anxious.

149
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,092
I'll be right there.

150
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,577
Hello, Xi Men.

151
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:26,112
Something happened to Ah Si.

152
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:51,637
Who?

153
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:53,105
You're waiting for Yesha?

154
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,040
What happened?

155
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:54,941
What?

156
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,877
Okay. I'll be right over.

157
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,078
Okay.

158
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:09,655
Where is the patients' ward?

159
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,157
The patients' ward is over there.

160
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,058
Thank you.

161
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:15,861
Yesha.

162
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,497
Sha, you've finally come.

163
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:19,665
I'm scared of hospitals.

164
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:21,467
Don't be afraid.

165
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,002
I'm here. I'll settle everything.

166
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,405
How about you? Are you hurt?

167
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:29,375
How about that person then?

168
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:31,444
He doesn't have much external injuries.

169
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,579
The doctor says he'll be fine
after regaining consciousness.

170
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,949
-But what if--
-Hey. There are no what-ifs.

171
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:38,918
You're both lucky to survive.

172
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:41,387
The doctors here in Spain are good.

173
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,321
I have a hunch.

174
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:43,623
<i>Amitabha.</i>

175
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:44,724
What?

176
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,492
Everything will be fine.

177
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,860
How can you be sure?

178
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:50,496
All right. Let me tell you
a true to life joke.

179
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,099
Do you know
that I had a car accident before

180
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,367
and hit someone?

181
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,268
His limbs were broken.

182
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:57,737
I was so nervous.

183
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,238
I almost jumped off a building.

184
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,207
But do you know what happened next?

185
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,109
After that person got discharged
from the hospital,

186
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,945
he brought his whole family to thank me.

187
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,781
Because of the accident,

188
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:15,488
the money he got from insurance claims
and from me saved their marriage.

189
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:18,391
Suddenly, a criminal becomes a benefactor.

190
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,059
Don't you think that's funny?

191
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:26,899
I also don't think that's funny.

192
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:30,336
Didn't you say it's not your fault?

193
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:32,171
Let's run away now.

194
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:33,205
Problem solved.

195
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,275
Am I that kind of person?

196
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:40,880
I'm also not that kind of person.

197
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,650
How could this happen?

198
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:48,454
Chinese people always talk about fate.

199
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,790
Whether good or bad,

200
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,125
there must be a reason it happened.

201
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:57,263
Still, I can be certain of one thing now.

202
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:00,366
Anything that happens
to someone as good as you

203
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:02,168
must be arranged by God.

204
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,335
It won't be a bad thing.

205
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,041
Do you know
why I've always stayed in Spain?

206
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,311
Of course, I do!

207
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,313
It's because you can't bear
to be without me.

208
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:17,316
I am really happy to know you, Sha.

209
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,919
I can't stand praises
coming from an angel.

210
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,488
I'm feeling a little dizzy.
Can you help me find a doctor?

211
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,590
Hey, doctor!

212
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:36,535
Let's go.

213
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,775
-Sha, look.
-What?

214
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:50,249
Hi.

215
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:52,551
<i>Amitabha.</i>

216
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:55,955
Are you feeling well?

217
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:08,768
Are you feeling well?

218
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:15,174
Are you okay?

219
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:20,913
Who are you?

220
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:22,715
He can talk.

221
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,250
There's no problem if he can talk.

222
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:27,219
Sorry, I'm Yesha.

223
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,287
My car hit yours.

224
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:31,657
Although the police say
the cause of the accident

225
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:33,325
is because you departed from the lane,

226
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,828
I still feel it's my fault.

227
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,798
That is why I've stayed by your side
for few days.

228
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:42,067
But because you don't have
any IDs with you,

229
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,203
I didn't know how to contact your family.

230
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,640
Do you want me to contact someone for you?

231
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:52,011
And what is your name?

232
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:00,119
Hey, don't tell me you forgot who you are?

233
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:06,392
-Hey.
-Hey.

234
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:36,755
You're awake.

235
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,760
Congratulations.
You're already out of danger.

236
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:44,163
You should be hungry now.

237
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,733
What do you want to eat? We have pears.

238
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,101
Apples.

239
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:50,803
Peaches.

240
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,171
Also vineyard grapes.

241
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,474
Don't worry. I'm a good person.

242
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,311
What do you want to eat?
Don't move your hand. Be careful.

243
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,846
The IV drip won't be able to get through.

244
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,147
Okay.

245
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,315
I won't touch you.

246
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,984
I won't touch you. I'm backing away.

247
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:08,187
I know you hate me.

248
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,689
It's my fault you turned out this way.

249
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:12,758
I'm sorry.

250
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,163
I picked up something from the scene.

251
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,832
I don't know if it's yours.

252
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:24,203
This ring.

253
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:25,771
Is it yours?

254
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:27,773
Please look at it.

255
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:35,281
Look. Is this yours?

256
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,720
-What's the matter?
-Where is this place?

257
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:42,755
Why am I here?

258
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:45,357
Why am I here?

259
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,126
-What are you doing?
-Tell me!

260
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:48,594
Who am I?

261
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:49,828
Why am I...

262
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:50,996
Who are you?

263
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:52,998
-Calm down!
-Tell me!

264
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,478
Original place...

265
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:07,513
What are you trying to say?

266
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:08,747
Original place...

267
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,751
-Original...
-Take it slow.

268
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:18,057
Don't rush. Take it slow.

269
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,625
Take your time. Don't rush.

270
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:20,893
Hey! What are you doing?

271
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,194
Sha, don't interfere.

272
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:23,729
I'm warning you!

273
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,064
I've practiced martial arts.

274
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,832
I know karate, judo, and tae kwon do.

275
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:27,833
If you don't release her.

276
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,401
I will be using my qigong.

277
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,103
He wants to speak. Let him speak.

278
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,138
-But he...
-Don't interfere.

279
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,441
Take it slow.

280
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:40,412
My balloon...

281
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,547
Don't rush.

282
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:42,881
...flew.

283
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:45,484
My...

284
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,921
Don't rush.

285
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:50,689
What original place?

286
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:51,924
Speak slowly.

287
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:00,332
Who am I?

288
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:16,482
Sha.

289
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:18,317
I'm in trouble, right?

290
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,553
No.

291
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,921
It'll be fine.

292
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:26,725
But the doctor said that a blood clot
is pressed against his cranial nerves.

293
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:28,427
So he lost all his memories.

294
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:30,996
Then what should we do now?

295
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,267
It's not a big deal.

296
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:37,569
He didn't become stupid.

297
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:39,171
He didn't lose any limbs.

298
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:40,672
That's already very fortunate.

299
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:42,041
He just lost his memories.

300
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:44,810
Now, he... Worse comes to worst,
let's just get his memories back.

301
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:47,212
That's right.

302
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:48,814
We should find his relatives first.

303
00:25:49,815 --> 00:25:52,151
But he doesn't have any IDs with him.

304
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,452
How should we start?

305
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:55,888
No problem. Leave it to me.

306
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,723
I've been a private investigator before.

307
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,727
There are many major criminal cases
in Taiwan

308
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:04,329
that won't be solved today if not for me.

309
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:05,831
Really?

310
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,332
Of course!

311
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:11,203
I would have to say
that I'm so lucky to know you.

312
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,472
Then how should we start now?

313
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,745
We start... by figuring out
where he came from.

314
00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:21,313
Taiwan.

315
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:23,182
Yes, Daoming Si.

316
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,652
Height, 183 cm. Weight, 75 kg.

317
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:28,854
Black hair, correct.

318
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,758
Deploy all the men that you have.

319
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:34,893
We've searched everywhere near the plaza

320
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,128
and this street.

321
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,297
Yes, I've also checked on this side.

322
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:39,198
Yes.

323
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,834
We searched here last night.

324
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:50,202
No exit records found for Ah Si.

325
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,272
I'll check Taiwan's
entry information again.

326
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:57,543
Hello.

327
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:01,813
I've already contacted
Spain's office in Taiwan.

328
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:03,415
Do you have any news there?

329
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,627
I went to that cathedral.

330
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,065
I'll go check Shancai.

331
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,493
Who would bring this when going overseas?

332
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:50,162
It's so funny.

333
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:47,219
We have news.

334
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:38,270
A lady driving a car hit him.

335
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:41,807
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

336
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:52,517
<i>Lei, the Barcelona police</i>

337
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:55,187
<i>confirmed that the victim
of this car accident is an Asian man.</i>

338
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:56,788
<i>The man is currently at Patali Hospital.</i>

339
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,590
<i>Let us meet there later. Come quickly.</i>

340
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:24,015
Where is that man?

341
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,384
I don't know.

342
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:27,686
Oh, no.

343
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:32,157
Hurry.

344
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:45,003
Have you seen this man?

345
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,204
Which one? No.

346
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:49,074
I think this person is not Ah Si.

347
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:51,109
It's because a friend
already picked him up.

348
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:55,480
Please look at this. Is he that patient?

349
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:58,850
No, I haven't seen this person.

350
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,552
What did she say?

351
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,721
She says he wasn't the patient.

352
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:04,890
Are you sure? Please look carefully again.

353
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:07,125
-Look carefully if this is him.
-Shancai, don't act like this.

354
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:08,293
Look... I'm not doing anything.

355
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,628
I just wanted her to look carefully.

356
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:10,629
Look more carefully again.

357
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,197
-His hairstyle is different now.
-Shancai.

358
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,166
Is it him? Look at it. It's him, isn't it?

359
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:15,934
-Am I right? Look.
-Shancai, don't act this way.

360
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:17,936
-Are you looking? It's him, right?
-Shancai!

361
00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:19,070
Enough.

362
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:22,908
Ah Si did not drive at all.

363
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:25,076
She already confirmed
that the person is not Ah Si.

364
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:27,446
You'll just become a laughingstock
if you make a scene like this.

365
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:28,346
Can't you calm down?

366
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:31,383
Yes, I can't calm down,
because I am different from you.

367
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,118
You say you're like brothers.

368
00:32:33,185 --> 00:32:35,287
At a time like this, you only care
about elegance and status.

369
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:39,157
-Shancai.
-Shancai.

370
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:45,764
She didn't mean it.

371
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:47,966
I know.

372
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,124
Shancai, eat something.

373
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:33,531
Shancai, you have to eat more.

374
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,201
Otherwise, when Ah Si comes back,
you'll really become all dried up.

375
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:37,802
He will certainly settle
the score with us.

376
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:42,240
Shancai, please.

377
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:43,308
Eat more.

378
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,210
If you're full, you'll have energy.

379
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:47,112
Recover your strength
so that we can look for Ah Si.

380
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:55,587
Shancai, eat slowly.

381
00:35:58,223 --> 00:35:59,057
It's so delicious.

382
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:00,725
It's really delicious.

383
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,460
I should eat more.

384
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:07,532
Shancai.

385
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:21,813
Sorry, it's all my fault.

386
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,748
I shouldn't have gotten mad at Lei.

387
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:25,083
I shouldn't have come to Spain.

388
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,851
I shouldn't have liked that ring.

389
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:30,889
I'm sorry.

390
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,235
Shancai.

391
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:45,837
Shancai.

392
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,389
Pretty boy.

393
00:38:12,557 --> 00:38:14,025
Aren't you tired from walking all day?

394
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:21,232
You should be hungry
even if you're not tired.

395
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,205
I really don't have any bad intentions.

396
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,610
Please give in
and come back with me, okay?

397
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:36,314
I swear I won't rape you.

398
00:38:36,381 --> 00:38:37,448
And I won't eat you.

399
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:41,820
Hey.

400
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,025
I'll get going then.

401
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:49,527
You may be robbed.

402
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,230
You may die of hunger on the streets.

403
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,234
I'm really going.

404
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:44,742
Hey.

405
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,048
You're hungry, right?

406
00:41:00,892 --> 00:41:01,826
Take this.

407
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,163
It's delicious.
I'm also eating the same thing.

408
00:41:11,536 --> 00:41:12,537
Hey.

409
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:29,620
Come in.

410
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:33,725
Come.

411
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,128
Don't be scared. Come in.

412
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:46,738
What took you so long?

413
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:52,610
Sorry.

414
00:41:54,412 --> 00:41:55,580
You can look around.

415
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:58,583
You can sleep wherever you like, okay?

416
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:04,589
Feel free to look around.

417
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,963
Why didn't I hear the car earlier?

418
00:42:12,397 --> 00:42:13,798
I walked back with him.

419
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:14,932
You walked back?

420
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,601
Where's my car then?

421
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,369
He's very insecure now.

422
00:42:18,436 --> 00:42:20,438
It doesn't matter as long as he is happy.

423
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:21,873
The times have changed.

424
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,474
Before, eating is what's most important.

425
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,710
Now, the amnesiac is most important.

426
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:27,045
It's okay.

427
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,534
Do you like this room?

428
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:51,436
This is your room.

429
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:02,213
This room has many windows.

430
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,614
You can see the scenery outside.

431
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:11,823
-Hey!
-Hey!

432
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:14,392
Why do we have an awful guest like you?

433
00:43:16,127 --> 00:43:17,628
Sleep well then.

434
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:20,264
I'll wake you up tomorrow morning
for breakfast.

435
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:23,034
Good night... Good morning.

436
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,404
-Where are you going to sleep?
-Anywhere is fine.

437
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,408
Hey, Sha.

438
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,810
How is he?

439
00:44:05,877 --> 00:44:07,745
I suggest you leave him alone.

440
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:09,547
He'll eat if he's hungry.

441
00:44:09,614 --> 00:44:11,315
When worse comes to worst,
he'll die of hunger.

442
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:29,834
Look. That's how he acts.

443
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:34,172
Hey!

444
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,008
You people.

445
00:44:39,744 --> 00:44:40,778
I don't care anymore.

446
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:54,085
