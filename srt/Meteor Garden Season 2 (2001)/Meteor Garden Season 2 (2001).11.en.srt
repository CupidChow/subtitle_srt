1
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,187
Yesha.

2
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,099
How are things with you today?

3
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,569
Not very well. And you?

4
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,271
Not very well.

5
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,407
I can see it from your expression.

6
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,675
What happened?

7
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:56,443
You first.

8
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,080
Actually, it's nothing.

9
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:01,214
I...

10
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,651
actually just got a few minor problems.

11
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:05,719
You first.

12
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:07,921
I won't tell you mine
if you don't tell me yours.

13
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,592
It's nothing.

14
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:13,794
It's just...

15
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,696
My boyfriend...

16
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,667
Did he dump you?

17
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:22,969
You could say that.

18
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,772
This guy must be a pig head.

19
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,575
I used to call him a pig head.

20
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:30,077
Because he deserves it.

21
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,979
You are so cute.

22
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,315
Only a pig head wouldn't treasure you.

23
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,084
It's actually not his fault.

24
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,218
He actually...

25
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:39,486
Of course, it's his fault.

26
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:40,854
This is too much.

27
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:42,222
He dumped you!

28
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,692
But rest assured,
he'll get what he deserves.

29
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,795
Something bad has indeed happened to him.

30
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:50,197
You see?

31
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:53,400
There will be more bad things
that will happen to him.

32
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,403
I curse this kind of guys.

33
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:57,637
Please don't.

34
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,072
-He--
-Yes, I will.

35
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:01,875
And I will curse him with all my power.

36
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:05,946
I will curse him that he will
step on dog poops every day.

37
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:12,552
And the toilet paper will run out
when he's in a rush to poop.

38
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,722
Anywhere he goes,
everyone will think he stinks.

39
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:18,125
And...

40
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,494
starting from today, his nose hairs
will grow backwards.

41
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,195
Ingrown nose hairs?

42
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,164
That's so ugly.

43
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,133
It will grow longer and longer.

44
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,001
It will grow inside.

45
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:29,903
It will grow into his head.

46
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,172
It will grow into his brain.

47
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:35,375
His brain will be surrounded
by the stinky and dirty nose hairs.

48
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:41,081
He won't be able to think straight.
And when his hairs are all gone,

49
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:45,352
then the nose hairs will grow out
of his head with boogers.

50
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,354
Oh, that's so disgusting.

51
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:49,756
Your turn.

52
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:50,957
My turn?

53
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,058
Your turn to curse him.

54
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:57,531
Then I curse him that his nose hairs
will continue to grow.

55
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,099
It will grow out of his ears.

56
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,867
There will be black curly hairs
in his ears

57
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:02,769
so he can't hear I'm calling him.

58
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:04,604
More.

59
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:05,672
More?

60
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:09,142
His nose hairs will grow out of his eyes
so he can't recognize anyone.

61
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,712
That's perfect.

62
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,348
No one will like such an ugly guy.

63
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:16,583
That's so funny.

64
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,851
It's so funny.

65
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:19,719
It's really funny.

66
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,762
Feeling better now?

67
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:32,065
Yeah, much better.

68
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,002
There will be nose hairs
all over his body.

69
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,104
Oh, my gosh, that's so funny.

70
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:42,943
Shancai.

71
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:46,580
If what we said really happens to him,

72
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,148
will you still love him?

73
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:52,986
Yes.

74
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,823
You love him so much.

75
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:03,630
For your happiness,
I'm going to take back all my curses.

76
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:05,265
Thanks.

77
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,338
Shancai.

78
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:14,341
Is love a painful thing?

79
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,213
Sometimes, it is painful.

80
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,782
But sometimes, it's sweet.

81
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,054
Yesha, what happened?

82
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:31,524
Nothing.

83
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:35,462
That stray dog I kept, he found his owner.

84
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:37,697
Oh, my god.

85
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,866
But you've bonded with it.

86
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,002
It's a difficult time, right?

87
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:48,808
Yesha, you can talk to its owner.

88
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,043
You two can care for it together.

89
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,611
-Together?
-Yeah.

90
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,246
You can make a schedule.

91
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:55,482
It lives in your house
on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

92
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,884
It lives in its former owner
on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.

93
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,587
It's a good idea.

94
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:04,457
If he really is a dog, I'll do that.

95
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:06,927
You mean...

96
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,930
Unfortunately, he is a man.

97
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:13,533
Yesha...

98
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,168
But that's okay.

99
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,537
I didn't fall in love with him.

100
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,106
I decided to return him to his owner.

101
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,511
My shoulder isn't wide enough,

102
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,112
but it's pretty useful.

103
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,649
If you want to cry, just cry.
Let it all out.

104
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,853
Actually, I don't want to cry at all.

105
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,755
I feel relieved.

106
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,025
Thank you, Shancai.

107
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,860
No problem.

108
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:44,698
Then, next time I want to cry,
you will lend me your shoulder.

109
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:45,765
Deal.

110
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,003
Let's drink.

111
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,037
Thanks.

112
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:30,937
Why are you standing here?

113
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:40,880
I was searching for my memories.

114
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:50,323
It's like sitting alone in a cinema
watching a movie featuring myself.

115
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,897
But the whole night...

116
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,703
Apart from me...

117
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:08,141
you're the only one in the movie.

118
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,711
Every movie is about you.

119
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,747
There's no one else.

120
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,550
Only you.

121
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,224
Yes, you don't remember her.

122
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,161
Don't you care
about all the things she has done?

123
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,763
Caring isn't falling in love.

124
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,133
That's how you feel now.

125
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,202
Are you sure you didn't love her before?

126
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,005
I don't know if I loved her or not
because I don't remember.

127
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,140
I don't remember!

128
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:50,049
Didn't it occur to you
that she is innocent?

129
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:56,356
Am I not innocent?

130
00:10:58,424 --> 00:10:59,492
What about you?

131
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,662
Aren't you innocent?

132
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,670
Why can't I choose to be who I am now?

133
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,241
That's your choice.

134
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:17,944
And I...

135
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,250
And you still choose to leave me, right?

136
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,453
I just want to give you back to her.

137
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:30,490
How?

138
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,258
Tell me how it's done.

139
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:33,593
Don't you know I'm in love with you?

140
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,994
I can never go back.

141
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:37,030
You have to.

142
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:39,632
After all, you are Daoming Si.

143
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:47,807
Fine.

144
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,443
I will go back.

145
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:56,583
As long as you look me
in the eye, and tell me...

146
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,554
you've never loved me.

147
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,191
You don't love me anymore.

148
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,761
If you can say it...

149
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,199
I'll go back to being Daoming Si.

150
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:16,436
Tell me.

151
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,338
Tell me!

152
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,174
I don't love you.

153
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,313
I don't love you.

154
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,216
I don't love you!

155
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,461
You're crying.

156
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,466
You should be happy
for telling me your thoughts.

157
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,170
Why are you crying now?

158
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,007
Stop pushing me.

159
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,919
Is it really painful to be with me?

160
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:17,897
I won't push you anymore.

161
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:19,399
What?

162
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,105
Aren't you going to leave?

163
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:31,511
Fine.

164
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:36,382
Let me throw my own memories away.

165
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,881
It is said that over a million people
pass through here every day.

166
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:18,551
I don't know them.

167
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:22,221
And they don't know me.

168
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:30,396
In this minute, I don't know
how many people have passed by me.

169
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:40,239
Right now, I am holding your hand, Yesha.

170
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:43,376
I'm afraid I can't be with you anymore.

171
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:53,319
I'll try to forget the hand I held before.

172
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:57,990
But you have to promise me one thing.

173
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:02,528
Don't look back when you leave.

174
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,965
I want to look at your back.

175
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,569
I want to remember your back.

176
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:37,643
It suddenly occurs to me that I'm
responsible for retrieving your memory.

177
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:43,349
Your memory is on vacation
and my mind is on vacation, too.

178
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,451
So let's make a deal.

179
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:46,519
I can only...

180
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:16,515
Didn't you say the client is sure
to sign the contract yesterday?

181
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,318
How should I know?

182
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,754
We got a "what if" situation here.

183
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:26,592
Then what should we do?
Shancai is going to register today.

184
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:29,562
How should I know what to do?

185
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,135
Honey, I got an idea.

186
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:39,605
We can call Master Huaze for help.

187
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,007
Right!

188
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:44,310
We can call Master Huaze.

189
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:47,279
But we don't have his phone number.

190
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:48,380
Well...

191
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,150
You go ask Shancai.

192
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,185
You do it.

193
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,088
No. I'm bad at acting.

194
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:57,556
She will see through me.

195
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,592
You're good at it. You do the acting.

196
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:00,593
You should go ask her.

197
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,061
I'm not good at it, too.

198
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:03,229
No need to be humble.

199
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:06,599
Didn't you join a drama club before?

200
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:07,900
You love acting.

201
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,968
Just...

202
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,102
Go. Just ask her.

203
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,479
What is it?

204
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:24,984
Mom, Dad, what's the matter?

205
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,519
Well...

206
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:27,419
It's about your dad.

207
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:28,754
Well... Not me...

208
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:30,289
Well...

209
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,259
It's about your mom, me.

210
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,227
-Yes, her.
-Me.

211
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:38,063
I miss Master Huaze.

212
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,465
I want to call him.

213
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:40,833
You know, chat with him.

214
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,435
Mom, you want to chat with Huaze Lei?

215
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,004
I promise you, Shancai,

216
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,107
your mom will never borrow money
from Huaze Lei.

217
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:49,608
Mom! Dad!

218
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:50,743
You fool.

219
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,111
What happened?

220
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:54,513
I deserve it.

221
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,148
I'm a fool.

222
00:21:56,215 --> 00:22:00,386
I'm a fool. I didn't get enough money
to pay your tuition for this semester.

223
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:02,421
I spent so much time.

224
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,323
I'm useless.

225
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,258
Don't worry about the tuition fee.

226
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,395
My salary and student loan can cover it.

227
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,197
Is... is it true?

228
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,198
Really?

229
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:13,599
Is everything fine now?

230
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:14,867
Is it true?

231
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:16,035
-Daughter...
-I'm running late.

232
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,469
You're amazing!

233
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,672
-I'm leaving now.
-Amazing...

234
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,144
One more thing.
Don't keep borrowing money. Okay?

235
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:27,179
-Okay. I know...
-Okay.

236
00:22:27,246 --> 00:22:28,414
Bye-bye.

237
00:22:29,615 --> 00:22:30,950
Shancai, bye-bye.

238
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,255
Great.

239
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:41,493
We have such a smart, capable,
and hardworking daughter.

240
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:43,896
Well, I'm so useless.

241
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:46,298
I can't even provide
my daughter's tuition.

242
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:49,034
Honey, don't say that.

243
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:51,337
This is a difficult time for everyone.

244
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:53,272
Of course, cars are hard to sell.

245
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:54,974
-Yeah.
-So...

246
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,011
As your wife, I can't just stay here

247
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:03,349
and do nothing in a time of crisis.

248
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:07,253
Like I said, you're a great wife.

249
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,988
Thank you for saying that.

250
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,522
I'm thinking right now.

251
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:14,059
I have to come up with an idea that works.

252
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,328
Do you have any good ideas?

253
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:21,734
Well, when I'm watching TV,
when people are selling cars,

254
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:28,807
there will always be a hot girl
posing beside the car.

255
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:31,510
You're right.

256
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:34,413
Cool cars and sexy girls
have always gone well together.

257
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,718
There always seems to be a sexy girl
beside the nice car to flatter...

258
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,590
Honey, you mean...

259
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:49,428
At this point, I have to...

260
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:58,203
sacrifice myself,
and use my beauty to help you.

261
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:03,142
From now on, I'll sell cars with you.

262
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:08,847
I'll be right next to the car
you're selling and get on it.

263
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,383
I'll lean, bend, and roll over it.

264
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,620
Stand up and lie down again.

265
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,724
Show all sorts of sexy poses.

266
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,627
Honey...

267
00:24:21,694 --> 00:24:23,195
I think you're really great.

268
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:24,830
You're an outstanding woman.

269
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:29,735
If you really will roll over my cars,
they will all be sold.

270
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,670
The more you roll, the more I sell.

271
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:39,178
No one knows my charisma better than you.

272
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:40,512
Yeah.

273
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:43,816
I'll be the one buying all the cars
you roll over on.

274
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:49,421
I'm so touched.

275
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:53,892
You love the cars I rolled over on so much
that you won't sell them.

276
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,562
I'm so touched, honey.

277
00:24:58,063 --> 00:24:59,164
-Wife.
-Yes?

278
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:01,066
You don't need to be so touched.

279
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:04,770
Because you would've crushed all the cars.

280
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,772
How could I not buy them?

281
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:11,176
Who wants to buy a car
crushed by a bulldozer?

282
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,380
I have to get to work.

283
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:27,092
Shancai.

284
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,861
Qinghe.

285
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:30,095
Shancai.

286
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:31,163
Awesome.

287
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,664
The classes finally start.

288
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:34,600
We can meet each other every day.

289
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:35,534
Yeah.

290
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:38,670
-Right! The tuition of this semester...
-Not a problem. It's settled.

291
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:42,541
I lost the opportunity to express
the meaning of friendship.

292
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:46,645
The best Valentine's Day presents
are your friendship and support.

293
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:47,613
Really?

294
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:48,814
Of course.

295
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,116
You should hurry up and register.

296
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,317
What about you?

297
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,787
I'm done registering.
I have to go to the cake shop.

298
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,755
Do you have work today?

299
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:59,258
I thought I could chat with you.

300
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:01,827
My class is about to start.
We can chat every day.

301
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,295
I'm leaving now. Bye-bye.

302
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,666
The power of friendship is so great.

303
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,601
Looks like I finally cheered her up.

304
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:18,143
Did you read the registration notice?

305
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,678
Did you?

306
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:21,380
What's this?

307
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:23,816
You think you can just walk in like that.
Is that right?

308
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:29,421
The notice told you that
the tuition fee is 158,303.50 NT Dollars.

309
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:31,757
You want to register
with only 30,000 NT Dollars.

310
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,693
Are you blind or have you lost your mind?

311
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,029
Sir, I'm sorry.

312
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,730
I know I haven't got enough money on me.

313
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:41,667
But isn't there student loans
for students with financial problems?

314
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,168
Look here.

315
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:47,439
Only the top students can apply
for student loans.

316
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,042
Pay the tuition fee first.

317
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,177
What are you looking at?

318
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:58,584
Sir, do you mean I can't attend Yingde
if I don't pay the full tuition?

319
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,219
Do you need to ask that?

320
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,386
Next!

321
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:03,722
Sir, please let me ask another question.

322
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,424
Is there any other way?

323
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:08,026
You don't have to attend Yingde
if you can't afford it.

324
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,295
It's all about money. Nothing else.

325
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:13,165
Who is that?

326
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,368
Should poor people be looked down upon?

327
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:19,371
Do they lose their right to education
because they're poor?

328
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:20,539
What are you doing?

329
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:23,942
One can live without money,

330
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,445
but not without the support of a friend.

331
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,714
I will lend you the tuition.

332
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,152
You...

333
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,916
Wow, what a pretty breakfast.

334
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:05,450
Did you make it yourself?

335
00:28:05,751 --> 00:28:09,087
No, it was made by my friend who works
at the breakfast restaurant.

336
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:12,691
Your friend can make
such a pretty breakfast.

337
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:18,564
You're upset about the stray dog.

338
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,065
You have a breakfast with hearts today.

339
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:22,100
You'd better tell me everything.

340
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,282
Shancai, come in and eat.

341
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:44,189
The lovely breakfast made
by "stray dog" Ah Xing.

342
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:45,691
I won't dare eat it.

343
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,092
There are two portions.

344
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:58,870
Ah Xing. What a unique name.

345
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:01,206
Do you like it? I gave him the name.

346
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:02,140
So it's you?

347
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:03,742
What's his real name then?

348
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:04,810
His...

349
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:06,912
Welcome!

350
00:29:12,718 --> 00:29:13,685
Hey.

351
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:16,622
You'd better tell me everything.

352
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:18,790
Tell you what?

353
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,460
Playing the fool, huh?

354
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:23,362
You're so brave.

355
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,398
If you won't tell me,
I'll do it the hard way.

356
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:29,201
-Nothing.
-Tell me about it.

357
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,903
Come on. Tell me.

358
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:39,811
Hey, Yesha.

359
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:48,153
I'm going to kill you.

360
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,955
You said there's nothing.

361
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:52,691
Don't be like that.

362
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:55,394
You'll get sick
if you keep it to yourself.

363
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:01,566
I'm in love.

364
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:03,268
Huh?

365
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,437
I'm in love.

366
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:06,972
What?

367
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:10,742
Are you deaf?

368
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:14,179
Really?

369
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:16,415
Wow, you hook her up?

370
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:20,686
Hey, thanks to me, right? Tell me.

371
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:21,887
It's because of me, isn't it?

372
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,121
All thanks to me, right? Tell me.

373
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:24,489
Hey.

374
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:27,459
You two didn't start working here
on the same day.

375
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:30,896
Are you planning to get fired
on the same day?

376
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,265
Aren't we closed?

377
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:34,833
Why don't you mop the floor?

378
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,903
-Come on.
-Did you hold hands?

379
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,438
Did you kiss?

380
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:40,906
Did you do this?

381
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,574
Tell me about it.

382
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,211
Hello.

383
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,679
Yes.

384
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:49,514
We have delivery service.

385
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:51,950
Tomorrow? No problem. One moment please.

386
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,618
Okay, go ahead please.

387
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,621
Twelve-inch birthday cake.

388
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,525
Recipient is Ms. Zhang, right? Very well.

389
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:02,861
Ms. Zhang.

390
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:04,796
Your last name, sir?

391
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,834
Mr. Gao.

392
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:11,269
And the address is?

393
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:14,773
Section three.

394
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:17,642
Okay.

395
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,145
Can I have your number, Mr. Gao?

396
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:24,516
Great.

397
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:26,885
Tomorrow. No problem. Of course.

398
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:28,353
Thank you. Bye.

399
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:40,532
It's already eleven.

400
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,601
I didn't eat breakfast.
No wonder I'm starving.

401
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,403
What do you want to eat, sir?
I'll get it for you.

402
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:46,905
Let's go. I'll treat you to lunch.

403
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:05,223
I saw a friend.
I'll treat you some other time.

404
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:38,023
Are you working here?

405
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:48,567
Yes.

406
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:51,536
We are closed.

407
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:08,420
Where are you going?
I'll drop you off there.

408
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:10,889
That's okay. I have a bike.

409
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,458
Ah Si.

410
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:16,795
Can I have a word with you?

411
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,077
I can't believe you were able
to learn all this.

412
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:33,712
You used to--

413
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:35,280
I don't want to talk about the past.

414
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,951
I'm doing well now.

415
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:43,154
I have many friends.

416
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:45,590
I learnt a lot.

417
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,293
I got a job.

418
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:54,165
The past means nothing to me now.

419
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:55,800
But we're worried about you.

420
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,269
I said I'm fine.

421
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,673
-I'm leaving now.
-Ah Si.

422
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:05,143
Is there anything I can do for you?

423
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:12,751
If you want to do something for me...

424
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:16,855
Please leave me alone.

425
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,898
Unbelievable! Old hag.

426
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:25,056
Hello.

427
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,024
I don't want it.

428
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:30,862
She doesn't want it.

429
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:47,846
This is the cake Mr. Gao
sends to Ms. Zhang.

430
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,147
I said I don't want it.

431
00:35:49,214 --> 00:35:50,882
-Get lost.
-You can't reject it.

432
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:53,351
-What should I do about the cake?
-Return it.

433
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:22,814
-<i>Good day, client!</i>
-Hi, I'd like to ask...

434
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:25,550
<i>Please dial the extension number.</i>

435
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:28,153
<i>Sales Department, please press 11.</i>

<i>Administration Department,

<i>Accounting Department, please press 51.</i>

439

<i>Connecting for you.

440
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:48,873
<i>This extension is busy.</i>

441
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:54,946
<i>Press pound to wait. The operator
shall be with you in a moment.</i>

442
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:58,983
Hello?

443
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:38,289
Wait a second.

444
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:40,158
I'll do it.

445
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,337
Why are you still here?

446
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:53,671
I'm sorry, Ms. Zhang...

447
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,607
I don't want it...
How many times do I have to say it?

448
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,909
You're really annoying.
I'll call the police if you don't leave.

449
00:37:57,976 --> 00:37:59,344
Please let me explain, okay?

450
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:02,380
I can't contact the sender, Mr. Gao.

451
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,215
But he already paid for it.

452
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,585
My conscience won't allow me
to just go and not deliver it.

453
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:09,621
Feed it to the dogs then.

454
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:12,190
Ms. Zhang, I...

455
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:50,161
Granny, why didn't you accept the cakes?

456
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:51,629
Today is your birthday.

457
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:53,231
None of your business.

458
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:55,033
Hey!

459
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:57,702
I care about you.

460
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:02,373
What a strange old lady.

461
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,657
CASH REGISTER OPEN

462
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,961
Thank you. This is your receipt.

463
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,463
I hope you win the prize.
Please come again.

464
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,664
Bye-bye.

465
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:32,704
Why did you bring the cake back?

466
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,272
She's a strange old lady.

467
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:35,874
She won't take it.

468
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,575
Why is that?

469
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:38,910
I don't know.

470
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:43,615
There were some cakes left at the door
when I got there.

471
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:45,350
I think she must have rejected those, too.

472
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:48,286
What now?

473
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,989
I don't know.

474
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:53,491
I can't contact the sender, Mr. Gao.

475
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:57,762
That old lady told me
to feed the cake to the dogs.

476
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:58,997
Then let's feed it to the dogs.

477
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,132
I'll take it to the pet shop later.

478
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:02,333
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

479
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:05,470
Wow, such a pretty cake.

480
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:08,039
All the baker's work has gone wasted.

481
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:12,277
Also, the sender's efforts were in vain.

482
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:18,583
I think there must be a story
behind this cake.

483
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:22,854
No one will refuse others' blessings
angrily for no good reason.

484
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:25,890
Yeah. Why wouldn't she accept it?

485
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:30,995
Maybe this cake isn't about
caring or blessing.

486
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:37,368
Maybe an unfilial son wants to placate
her mom by sending her a cake.

487
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:39,971
So the mom was so angry.

488
00:40:40,138 --> 00:40:41,706
Yeah, that must be it.

489
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:44,375
I don't know what the story is.

490
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,878
I'm sure that there's a misunderstanding.

491
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:47,879
You're right.

492
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:49,948
Even if the delivery failed,

493
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:54,085
we must let the sender know
the misunderstanding hasn't been resolved.

494
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:55,253
I agree.

495
00:40:56,354 --> 00:40:59,891
The problem is, I can't find Mr. Gao.

496
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:01,960
No one answered the phone?

497
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,762
It seems like it's a business number.

498
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,931
I can't get through.

499
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:09,767
What should we do?

500
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:16,808
We can call them and get their address.

501
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:18,509
Then we can meet Mr. Gao in person.

502
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:22,313
Right. Why didn't I think of it?

503
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:27,185
We have a Chinese saying, "Three cobblers
are equal to one Zhuge Liang."

504
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:29,020
The two of us make a great team.

505
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,655
Three what?

506
00:41:30,722 --> 00:41:31,990
Cobblers.

507
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:35,493
Never mind. I mean,
the two of us are awesome.

508
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,662
Shancai and Yesha are the best.

509
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:51,042
Hey, watch out!

510
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:55,480
I'm sorry. I wouldn't dodge
if I knew you're there.

511
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:56,881
Are you okay, Grandpa?

512
00:41:56,948 --> 00:41:59,117
It's nothing. Accidents happen sometimes.

513
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,551
Hey, aren't you going to apologize?

514
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:01,619
Did the ball hit you?

515
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:04,389
No, but it hit this grandpa.
You should apologize to him.

516
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:06,124
If apologies are useful then...

517
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:07,692
All right. Sorry.

518
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:16,868
Young lady.

519
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:20,471
You have a strong sense of justice.

520
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:22,874
Thank you for standing up for me.

521
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,143
You're welcome.
It's important that you're fine, Grandpa.

522
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,878
I should go ahead.

523
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:28,880
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

524
00:42:39,457 --> 00:42:40,625
This way please.

525
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:49,734
Hi, I'm looking for Mr. Gao.

526
00:42:49,801 --> 00:42:51,369
Please register for me.

527
00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:52,303
Okay.

528
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,373
But I don't know his full name.

529
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,607
All I know is he's Mr. Gao.

530
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:58,943
Do you know which department he is in?

531
00:42:59,010 --> 00:42:59,977
I don't know.

532
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,779
Could you come back
with necessary information?

533
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:03,081
Okay.

534
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:04,582
Thank you. I'm sorry.

535
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:12,623
Excuse me, sir. Are you Mr. Gao?

536
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,125
-Sorry, no.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

537
00:43:14,192 --> 00:43:15,159
Are you Mr. Gao?

538
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:16,961
-Sorry, I'm not.
-I'm sorry.

539
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,931
Madam, do you have a Mr. Gao
in your department?

540
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:22,300
Excuse me, is your last name Gao?

541
00:43:22,567 --> 00:43:24,035
Is anyone of you Mr. Gao?

542
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:25,069
-I'm not.
-No.

543
00:43:25,136 --> 00:43:26,003
