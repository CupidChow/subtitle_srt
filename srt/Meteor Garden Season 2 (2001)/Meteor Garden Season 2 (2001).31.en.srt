1
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,901
<i>There's only a thin line
between a genius and an idiot.</i>

2
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,171
<i>But based on your IQ,
you can't see genius, of course.</i>

3
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:19,573
<i>You can only see idiots.</i>

4
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,375
I can only see an idiot?

5
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:25,779
That's right.

6
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,116
There are so many
beautiful women in the world.

7
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,518
How come I only see...

8
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,820
an idiot staring blankly above
with her head raised?

9
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:43,196
<i>Are memories pleasant or painful?</i>

10
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,733
<i>I think this is a test from God.</i>

11
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:53,473
<i>I'm now slowly realizing
that no matter where Daoming Si is,</i>

12
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,709
<i>our memories will always stay with me.</i>

13
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,445
<i>I can't get away from it.</i>

14
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:59,813
<i>And no one can take them away.</i>

15
00:03:58,872 --> 00:03:59,706
Hey, how are you?

16
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,374
I'm Shancai, the tour guide from Taiwan.

17
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,113
Members of the "Promise of Love Tour",
please board the bus.

18
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,482
Members of the "Promise of Love Tour",
please board the bus.

19
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:16,289
Lu Peiling.

20
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,224
Here.

21
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,125
Xu Zhiyi.

22
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,226
Here.

23
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:20,127
Huang Junxian.

24
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,361
Here.

25
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,295
Yu Renfeng.

26
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,196
Here.

27
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,499
Lin Shumei, Zhou Wuxiong.

28
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:29,102
Lin Shumei, Zhou Wuxiong.

29
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:32,139
Shancai, I saw them earlier.
They're over there buying souvenirs.

30
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,541
They're always the cause of delay.

31
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:37,310
It's fine. Please wait here.
Let me check on them.

32
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:56,363
Miss Shancai.

33
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:57,964
I'm giving you my happiness.

34
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,298
Shancai, they're back.

35
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:32,332
I see. All right.

36
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:40,974
Las Ramblas is Barcelona's
most popular area.

37
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:46,546
It's a street with many restaurants,
cafes, and other unique shops.

38
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:49,115
Later, we'll have our free time there.

39
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,152
Let's meet at five o' clock
at the Canaletes Fountain.

40
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:53,453
Please be on time.

41
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,522
Or else we won't be able
to make it to the Bull Run.

42
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:59,059
Hey, Shancai. I heard that if you drink
from the Caneletes Fountain,

43
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,228
you'll surely return to Barcelona one day.

44
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,162
Is that true?

45
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:05,866
I'm not sure either.

46
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,901
However, I drank
from that fountain before.

47
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,102
And now, I'm back here.

48
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,071
Then I'm going to drink a lot from it.

49
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:02,722
<i>Maybe the legend about the fountain
really brought me back to Barcelona.</i>

50
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:05,792
<i>What about Daoming Si?</i>

51
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:27,380
<i>Daoming Si.</i>

52
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,481
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

53
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:29,783
<i>I'm here.</i>

54
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:57,904
How are you?

55
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:03,209
How are you?

56
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:06,880
I'm fine.

57
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,683
I'm fine too.

58
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,526
What a coincidence.

59
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:27,534
I should go.

60
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,839
Daoming Si, I...

61
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:36,943
What?

62
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,480
See you in Taipei.

63
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,219
See you in Taipei.

64
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:06,906
Shancai.

65
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,659
Daoming Si.

66
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,596
Where are you going?

67
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,890
You look so serious.
What did you pray for?

68
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,865
I told Him I traveled far to get here.

69
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,167
So please quit playing games with us.

70
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:42,769
I'm serious.

71
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,004
Daoming Si.

72
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,106
Who talks to God so impolitely?

73
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,442
Who says I'm impolite?

74
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:51,177
I said, "please".

75
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:52,378
Is that impolite?

76
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,547
Never mind. You're not going to get it.

77
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:56,583
-I...
-I'm sorry, God.

78
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,551
That's just how he talks.

79
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:00,019
Please don't blame him.

80
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,156
God is not as narrow-minded as you.

81
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:05,758
I'm narrow-minded?

82
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,327
Yes, you are.

83
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,963
That's right. I'm narrow-minded.
That's why I like a stupid boy like you.

84
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,998
If I only knew. I'll just be with Lei,
who's less stupid.

85
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,234
Even Ximen, Meizuo,
those two idiots are...

86
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,311
You're so stupid, Daoming Si.

87
00:12:58,378 --> 00:12:59,879
Why did you carve it so badly?

88
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:06,853
SHAN AND SI

89
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,588
<i>Let's toast</i>

90
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,691
<i>to Shancai and Ah Xing.</i>

91
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,061
<i>I wonder what the two of them</i>

92
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,797
<i>are doing in Barcelona.</i>

93
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:19,632
<i>What else, but calling...</i>

94
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,401
<i>-each other stupid.</i>
<i>-each other stupid.</i>

95
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:31,277
SO THE STORY CONTINUE...

96
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,648
