1
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,456
Are you Mr. Gao?

2
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,391
-Sorry, I'm not.
-I'm sorry.

3
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,893
Madam, do you have a Mr. Gao
in your department?

4
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,961
Excuse me.

5
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:09,730
Excuse me, is your last name Gao?

6
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,164
Is anyone of you Mr. Gao?

7
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,165
-I'm not.
-No.

8
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,266
I'm sorry.

9
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:15,135
Are you Mr. Gao?

10
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:17,304
-Sorry, you got the wrong person.
-Oh, sorry.

11
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,740
Are you Mr. Gao?

12
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:20,974
-No.
-Sorry.

13
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,376
Are you Mr. Gao?

14
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,144
-No, I'm not.
-Sorry.

15
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:56,376
Mr. Gao.

16
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:58,879
Mr. Gao.

17
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,480
Mr. Gao.

18
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,151
Mr. Gao again?

19
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,756
How many Mr. Gaos does Granny know?

20
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,400
There are so many cakes.

21
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,237
A birthday without her family.

22
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,241
Granny must be very lonely.

23
00:03:58,505 --> 00:03:59,639
I'm busy.

24
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,077
Don't you understand that I'm busy?

25
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,352
<i>Happy birthday, Granny</i>

26
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,255
<i>Happy birthday, Granny</i>

27
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:18,391
<i>Happy birthday to Granny</i>

28
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:22,896
<i>Wishing Granny to be happy
Whenever she sees me</i>

29
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,098
What gibberish are you singing?

30
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,434
Wishing Granny to be forever youthful,

31
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:32,139
beautiful, generous, lovely,
and to scold people with a louder voice.

32
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,473
Do you think I like to scold people?

33
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,609
You deserve to be scolded.

34
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,344
Okay, I deserve it.

35
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:41,114
So, can this soft-spoken granny
try to drink and taste

36
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:43,250
this fruit juice I prepared
for this celebration?

37
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:46,019
This tastes really good.

38
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,088
Are you trying to give me
an upset stomach?

39
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,689
Oh, come on.

40
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:52,159
Let's go.

41
00:04:57,898 --> 00:04:59,499
Make a wish first, Granny.

42
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,103
Done?

43
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,037
Let's blow the candles.

44
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,473
One, two, three.

45
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,444
Happy birthday!

46
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:12,813
Thank you.

47
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:16,683
Taste it.

48
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:21,388
Does it taste good?

49
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,291
What's that strange taste?

50
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,928
Come on! "Strange taste"?

51
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,163
It's my special mixed juice.

52
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:32,399
It really tastes strange.

53
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:36,570
But I guess I'll miss this strange taste
after I move to Canada.

54
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:38,905
Why will you miss it?

55
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:42,776
If you like it, I will prepare this
for you each year for your birthday.

56
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,245
Then you have to remember
this exact taste.

57
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:46,713
I don't want any other taste.

58
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,781
Is that a problem?

59
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:48,849
It's easy!

60
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,183
Really?

61
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,087
How long will you be away
on this vacation abroad?

62
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:55,622
Who said I'm going on a vacation?

63
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:56,923
I am migrating.

64
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:58,391
Migrate?

65
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,293
Why so suddenly?

66
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,428
It's not sudden.

67
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,597
I've decided long ago to migrate.

68
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,066
If not for you two insisting
on staying at my loft,

69
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,368
I would have sold this house early on.

70
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,503
You're selling this house?

71
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:15,242
But since you're here,
you can help me manage this house.

72
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,443
I am warning you.

73
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,078
Take good care of this house.

74
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:20,647
This is a pretty nice house.

75
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,915
Why do you want to sell it?

76
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,886
And you have Yesha and me
to celebrate your birthdays--

77
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,587
You don't have to.

78
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:29,256
There is no need.

79
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:33,026
You have to take good care
of Yesha. Understood?

80
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:38,465
Don't be a heartless, stupid guy
saying that you love her

81
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:41,001
without understanding how she feels.

82
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,236
I certainly understand Yesha.

83
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:44,504
What do you know about her?

84
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,840
-I...
-Do you know what perfume she likes,

85
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,742
or what cake she likes to eat?

86
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,177
She...

87
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,515
I'll ask her next time.

88
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:57,751
Next time?

89
00:06:58,318 --> 00:06:59,619
What if you don't have that chance?

90
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:01,821
You men are all the same.

91
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,990
Self-righteous and confident.

92
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:06,860
You don't know
what women are thinking about.

93
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,361
Men will be men.

94
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,763
Nothing good comes from you.

95
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,703
Why does she have to be so angry?

96
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,173
Did I offend her?

97
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:37,590
Hi, are you Mr. Gao?

98
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,295
-Hi, are you Mr. Gao?
-Sorry.

99
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,444
Hi, are you Mr. Gao?

100
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,411
Sorry, I'm not.

101
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,546
-Sorry.
-Excuse me.

102
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,314
You've been asking for an hour.

103
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:03,616
I will be reprimanded
if you go on like that.

104
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:04,784
Sorry, sir.

105
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,486
I've been entrusted to do this.

106
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,021
I must find Mr. Gao.

107
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:09,022
Please.

108
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,024
Please don't make it hard for me.

109
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,393
Sir, please don't make it hard for me too.

110
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,328
I really need to find Mr. Gao.

111
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,702
Grandpa, what a coincidence.

112
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,170
You've also come here.

113
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,605
I saw you from outside.

114
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:26,740
You're so busy.

115
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,009
I've come to find a Mr. Gao.

116
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,980
You helped me in the park just now.

117
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,082
Let me help you now, all right?

118
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,017
Huh?

119
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,085
There's no need.

120
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,153
Let's go up the elevator.

121
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,622
I'll follow you. Go ahead.

122
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:52,432
Grandpa.

123
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:53,700
Where are we going?

124
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,402
We're looking for Mr. Gao upstairs.

125
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,577
Come on. Let's go, come on.

126
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:05,879
Come on. It's going up.

127
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:08,281
It's not full, come in.

128
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,522
What floor are you going to?

129
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,757
Twelve... twelfth floor.

130
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:18,992
Twelfth floor.

131
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:21,628
Thank you, Mr. Pres...

132
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:29,869
Young lady.

133
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,038
Why are you looking for Mr. Gao?

134
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:37,310
Yesterday, a certain Mr. Gao ordered
a cake to be delivered to Ms. Zhang.

135
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,279
But there seems to be
a misunderstanding between them.

136
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:42,048
Therefore, Ms. Zhang won't accept it.

137
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:44,784
I think their misunderstanding
will get even more serious,

138
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:47,220
so I have to find Mr. Gao.

139
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,062
-Good morning.
-Hi, Mr. President.

140
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,068
You've cut your hair?

141
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,137
Let's go.

142
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,005
Hello.

143
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,154
How long will you keep me waiting?

144
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,389
Sorry, President Daoming.

145
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,825
Our president
really didn't mention anything.

146
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,699
-Hi, Mr. President.
-Hi.

147
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:34,534
Hi, Mr. President.

148
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:36,369
Hi, Mr. President.

149
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:38,872
-Hi, Mr. President.
-Hello.

150
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:43,910
Grandpa.

151
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,979
Are you really the president
of this building?

152
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,915
I am also the dazed old man in the park.

153
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,851
No wonder you said you can help me.

154
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:52,785
Hi, Mr. President.

155
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:55,388
Come, let's go inside.

156
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:59,159
Mr. President.

157
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,428
President Daoming is waiting for you.

158
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:03,796
President Gao.

159
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:06,933
I've been waiting for you.

160
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,473
Shall we discuss the planned merger?

161
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,674
Not today.

162
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,576
I have a very important guest.

163
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:18,945
Young lady, come in.

164
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,792
Is she your guest?

165
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,661
That's right.

166
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,396
She's my valuable guest.

167
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:37,730
Let's talk another day.

168
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,365
Come here, young lady.

169
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:43,403
President Gao.

170
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:44,971
President Gao!

171
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,184
Are there any other matters?

172
00:11:58,251 --> 00:11:59,219
No.

173
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:00,853
Sir.

174
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,323
President Daoming insists on waiting.

175
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:07,794
Let her wait.

176
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,465
Why are you laughing?

177
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:14,467
It's nothing.

178
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:18,037
I just can't imagine how can such
a bossy man yield to Grandpa.

179
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:18,972
Please sit.

180
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:21,641
You know that woman, too?

181
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:22,842
She is...

182
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,278
Oh, it's nothing.

183
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:29,515
There are many people
who just yield to money.

184
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,817
Mr. President, have some tea.

185
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,253
-Give her some juice.
-Yes.

186
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,454
Don't trouble yourself.

187
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,589
It's not troublesome.

188
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,392
Look at you. You're all sweaty.

189
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,262
It's good to have some orange juice.

190
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,197
You don't have to, Grandpa.

191
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:47,233
I want to find Mr. Gao quickly
and give this cake to him.

192
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,035
I have to return to the store.

193
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,437
Besides, don't you have guests?

194
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,976
I think I didn't ask your name.

195
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,945
I'm Shancai.

196
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,079
Shancai.

197
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,915
Let grandpa tell you something.

198
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:04,584
First.

199
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:09,188
That woman outside is not my guest.

200
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,659
She is someone I dislike.

201
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:15,728
Second.

202
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,997
Your work is already done,

203
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:22,935
so you can just sit here
and have some juice.

204
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,539
My work is already done?

205
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,341
Yes.

206
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,677
I am that Mr. Gao who ordered the cake.

207
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,346
So you are Mr. Gao.

208
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:39,385
Actually, I should thank you
for exerting all efforts to find me.

209
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:43,623
Your persevering attitude moved me.

210
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,628
I'm returning this to you, Mr. Gao.

211
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:50,530
Let me explain.

212
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:54,167
Ms. Zhang refused this cake outright
without even looking at it.

213
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,135
Moreover...

214
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,939
She also wants it to be fed to the dogs.

215
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,508
I'm sorry. I am just relaying her words.

216
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:03,810
Please don't be angry.

217
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:05,578
No need to be sorry.

218
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:09,615
It's completely my fault
because I forgot what flavor she likes.

219
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:12,685
Flavor?

220
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,554
But she didn't even open it.

221
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,155
How could she know?

222
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,358
She...

223
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,627
All in all, I am grateful for you.

224
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:23,896
You're welcome.

225
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,268
I'll be going now. Goodbye.

226
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:30,636
Don't you want some more juice?

227
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,271
No, thank you, Grandpa.

228
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:36,075
Are you thinking
that I'm making fun of you?

229
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:37,643
That's why you're upset with me?

230
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,911
No.

231
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:42,582
I just don't want other people
to think that I'm currying favor.

232
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:46,386
Currying favor from a dazed old man

233
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:50,156
in the park because he is troubled?

234
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,059
I actually appreciate this kind of person.

235
00:14:54,427 --> 00:15:00,133
Do you want to drink some juice
with this troubled old man?

236
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,402
Yes.

237
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:49,949
-This is unacceptable.
-Sorry, President Daoming.

238
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:52,084
I've been waiting for so long
and you still won't let me in.

239
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,020
I am really sorry, President Daoming.

240
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:56,823
Old Gao!

241
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,591
I know you can hear me.

242
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,561
Blocking this merger
won't benefit you at all.

243
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:04,630
President Daoming, I'm really sorry.

244
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,467
The president is having a video meeting.

245
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:14,474
Please tell President Gao
I won't easily give up.

246
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,291
Mr. President.

247
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:36,128
I don't remember today is your birthday.

248
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:38,664
It's indeed not my birthday.

249
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:42,468
It's only a regret.

250
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:46,939
Here. Give this to our employees.

251
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,242
Don't waste the effort in this cake.

252
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:50,176
Got it.

253
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:52,612
Is Daoming Feng gone?

254
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:55,715
Looks like she hasn't given up.

255
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,950
I believe she will pay you another visit.

256
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,456
She is successful as a businesswoman,

257
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:07,460
but she failed to be a decent person.

258
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:09,562
It's so hard.

259
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:11,564
Okay, go ahead.

260
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:35,421
Welcome home.

261
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,024
Are you hungry? Do you want some cake?

262
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:41,227
I've looked at cakes the whole day,
and you still want me to eat cakes?

263
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:44,363
I have no choice.
We have a bunch of cakes at home.

264
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:48,034
A bunch of cakes? Why?

265
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:51,504
It's Granny's birthday today.

266
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:54,407
Then there are a bunch of cakes
from a certain Mr. Gao.

267
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:55,841
It's weird.

268
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:56,876
Mr. Gao?

269
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,414
Is Granny's last name Zhang?

270
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:03,950
Yeah.

271
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:08,187
Moreover, Granny is really weird.
She rejected all the cakes.

272
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:12,258
I am just afraid to waste it,
or else I could have secretly--

273
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:14,293
Ah Xing!

274
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,196
Quick!

275
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,565
-Come on.
-Coming!

276
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:43,022
That dog just--

277
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,023
Hey, you two.

278
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,058
Why don't you mind your own business?

279
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:47,660
Throw it all away.

280
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:49,962
Granny, you can't be serious, right?

281
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:53,432
Might as well give the cake to me
rather than throwing it away.

282
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:54,367
It's such a waste.

283
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,202
I told you to throw it away.

284
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:57,737
Buy one yourself if you like.

285
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,206
-Hey, you--
-Okay...

286
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,575
-I...
-Just do what Granny says, okay?

287
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,744
Hurry. Help Granny throw it away.

288
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,078
Quickly.

289
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,981
Granny doesn't like the taste of these.

290
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:13,352
How do you know I don't like them?

291
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,756
If you like them, why do you insist
on throwing them away?

292
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:19,158
Am I right?

293
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:20,926
You smart-ass.

294
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,362
Granny, what flavor do you like?

295
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:24,797
I'll ask Ah Xing to buy one for you.

296
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:26,265
Don't bother.

297
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,401
Who cares about the flavor?

298
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,537
Then what's up with Mr. Gao?

299
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,016
We're really gonna throw these away?

300
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,484
Can we eat them?

301
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:47,086
You eat them.

302
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:49,822
Really?

303
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:52,658
All right then.

304
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,999
<i>He is one grade higher than me.</i>

305
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,903
<i>That year, our college planned
a bike outing.</i>

306
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:05,938
<i>I was on his bike.</i>

307
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:07,873
<i>We had an accident.</i>

308
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:11,877
<i>I was in the hospital for three days,
and he turned out unscathed.</i>

309
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,480
<i>He was there for me those three days.</i>

310
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:18,417
After that,

311
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:20,453
we started dating.

312
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,155
Everything was great at first.

313
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,293
But after he was discharged
and found a job, everything changed.

314
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:30,296
He was always aloof when he was with me.

315
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,998
Nine out of ten times
he would be late for our date.

316
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:34,767
He wouldn't even show up sometimes.

317
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:38,804
The most irritating part is
he even forgot my birthday.

318
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,941
Oh, no. You must be very angry, Granny.

319
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:43,075
Of course!

320
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,112
As a result, the following day,

321
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,681
he brought a birthday cake,
and I just drove him out.

322
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:51,350
He didn't even know what he did wrong.

323
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:52,818
I said...

324
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:55,354
<i>"There are many things you did wrong.</i>

325
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,791
<i>For example, I hate chocolate cakes.</i>

326
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:00,760
<i>But you still bought me a chocolate cake."</i>

327
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,964
And he thought
that I was really mad at the cake.

328
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:10,236
He asked, "What cake do you like?
I'll buy you one tomorrow."

329
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:14,673
So, Granny, what cake do you like to eat?

330
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:18,677
Hearing that, I got even more irritated.

331
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:24,316
I remember that one time
when we were eating a cake together.

332
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,985
I was happy at that time.

333
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:30,890
Thinking about it, I got madder.

334
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:36,028
I told him, "You don't even know
what cake I like and you say you love me?"

335
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:40,199
He went furious,
saying that I was being unreasonable.

336
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:45,771
He told me to give him two days
for him to buy me a cake.

337
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:47,473
It was a quarrel, you know?

338
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,911
Pointing to his nose, I said,
"You won't be able to buy it in 30 years."

339
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:57,883
Unfortunately...

340
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:00,786
today marks exactly 30 years.

341
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:03,389
Thirty years?

342
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:06,692
You've been angry
about a cake for 30 years?

343
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:12,064
What good is a man
if he can't figure me out in 30 years?

344
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:14,967
Really?

345
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:18,370
Do you really think that your heart
is saying the same thing?

346
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:22,174
Then why did you wait 30 years
for the answer?

347
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:29,815
How special is that cake
that it made you waste 30 years?

348
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:34,520
<i>It's just a piece of...</i>

349
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:46,198
Shancai.

350
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,133
Shancai, she likes sponge cakes.

351
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,535
Sponge cakes.

352
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,076
Miss! Miss, you can't go in.

353
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,646
Miss, excuse me. Please don't trespass.

354
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,682
This is urgent. I must see Grandpa Gao.

355
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,651
-Grandpa Gao?
-He is your president.

356
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,254
I am sorry, but the president is waiting
for an important guest.

357
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,154
You can't go in.

358
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,891
Then tell him Shancai is here.
He'll let me in immediately.

359
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,493
I'm sorry, miss.
I am told that no one can go in.

360
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,896
This matter affects the lifetime happiness
of your president.

361
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,998
He has been working hard for this company.

362
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,333
Do you want him to be lonely
in his old age?

363
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:24,303
Wait a moment, miss.
How about this, write it down.

364
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,771
I'll find a way to give it to him.

365
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:27,373
All right.

366
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:48,994
President Daoming.

367
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,333
It's you again.

368
00:23:57,136 --> 00:23:59,738
President Daoming, this way, please.

369
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,106
Our president is waiting for you.

370
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:07,279
Miss, you're here again.

371
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,917
-I'm counting on you.
-All right.

372
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:21,060
President Gao, finally.

373
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,828
It's so hard to meet you.

374
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:24,229
President Daoming.

375
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,866
This meeting today is arranged
as per your request.

376
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:32,738
I hope that you will contribute much
to the proposal later.

377
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,873
I come prepared.

378
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,874
All right.

379
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,443
Let's see the images.

380
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:38,577
Please.

381
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:39,979
President.

382
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:53,859
Is something wrong, President?

383
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:56,962
I suddenly have an important matter
that I need to attend to.

384
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:58,731
President Gao.

385
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:01,200
If this is to test my sincerity--

386
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,702
I absolutely have faith in it.

387
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:07,473
But this is really very important
and it cannot wait.

388
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,375
We'll talk about this later.

389
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,444
President Gao!

390
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,345
Shancai.

391
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:14,313
Hi, Mr. President.

392
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,481
Shancai!

393
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:17,583
-Grandpa.
-Let's go buy that sponge cake.

394
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:19,184
Grandpa, do you remember
where is the store?

395
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,053
Yes! I suddenly remember
after seeing your note.

396
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,588
It should be in Changhua.

397
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:24,056
Changhua?

398
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:27,092
Oh, my! We'll spend
about five hours on the road.

399
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:29,695
But Ms. Zhang is going
to Canada tomorrow morning.

400
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:33,065
We can make it! We have to make it!

401
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:35,534
President Gao, I really don't understand.

402
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:38,103
Shancai, what are you up to?

403
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:40,372
Let's go.

404
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:41,907
President Gao!

405
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,355
She really knows how to torture people.

406
00:25:58,857 --> 00:25:59,792
Grandpa.

407
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:08,467
I really can't imagine
all she wants is a piece

408
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:12,271
of unremarkable sponge cake.

409
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:18,710
Maybe it's because of the sweet memories.

410
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,818
While studying in college,

411
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:29,188
one day I had the courage

412
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:32,491
to ask Hong out.

413
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:34,760
Surprisingly, she agreed.

414
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:40,165
<i>That's my... Our first formal date.</i>

415
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,037
<i>I had to submit a report
the day before our date.</i>

416
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,639
<i>I've been busy the whole day.</i>

417
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,576
<i>I even forgot to eat.</i>

418
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:55,314
<i>While waiting for her at the alley,
my stomach was rumbling.</i>

419
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,617
<i>So you bought a sponge cake.</i>

420
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,285
<i>Yes.</i>

421
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:06,191
<i>I went into a bakery and bought a cake.</i>

422
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,761
<i>When I was gorging on it,</i>

423
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,030
<i>Hong appeared.</i>

424
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:14,500
<i>She asked me...</i>

425
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:16,869
<i>"Is it really that delicious?"</i>

426
00:27:19,605 --> 00:27:22,107
<i>I was about to answer her
when she grabbed a piece of cake</i>

427
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:23,709
<i>and ate it down.</i>

428
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:26,979
<i>She said, "Hey, this is really delicious."</i>

429
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:33,218
<i>So we shared that sponge cake.</i>

430
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,522
<i>I was so excited back then.</i>

431
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:41,660
<i>I told her that I'm going to find
a job after I graduate.</i>

432
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:48,033
<i>That when I receive my first salary,
I'll buy eight, ten sponge cakes for her.</i>

433
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,068
<i>She can have as many cakes as she wants.</i>

434
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:58,076
<i>I can still remember her smile.</i>

435
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:01,313
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

436
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:07,519
<i>I forgot those important words
that I said to her.</i>

437
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,392
<i>It took me 30 years to remember.</i>

438
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:22,201
Could you please calm down?
Granny will become suspicious.

439
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:24,736
What's taking them so long?

440
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:27,506
How should I know?
Just sit here for a second.

441
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:32,077
Where did they go?

442
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:35,414
A place called "Chang" something.

443
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,815
Chang...

444
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:39,151
Changhua.

445
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:40,686
Changhua.

446
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:42,554
Is it far from here?

447
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:44,223
I don't know. I heard it's pretty far.

448
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,158
I wonder if they'll make it
before Granny...

449
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,226
Granny.

450
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:48,460
Granny.

451
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:51,196
This is for you.

452
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:52,931
Why?

453
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:55,167
Does it need to have a reason?

454
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:56,969
Besides, it doesn't fit me anymore.

455
00:28:58,537 --> 00:28:59,871
I'm going to sleep.

456
00:29:00,272 --> 00:29:02,474
You two be quiet. Don't disturb me.

457
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:06,144
No need to send me off tomorrow morning.

458
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,312
I hate that kind of stuff.

459
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:09,281
-But...
-Not even a send-off?

460
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:10,449
Yeah.

461
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:12,084
I said no.

462
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,088
What should we do?

463
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:17,122
What's that?

464
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,196
Isn't this the dress you borrowed
from her last time?

465
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:25,197
Oh, yes.

466
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,200
You begged several times
before she finally agreed.

467
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,534
Really?

468
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,303
She was quite hesitant about it.

469
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,771
Why did she give it to you?

470
00:29:32,838 --> 00:29:34,606
Yes, why did she?

471
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:54,026
What should we do?

472
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:04,736
Do you have their phone number?

473
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,984
Grandpa, are you sure it's here?

474
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,853
It should be nearby.

475
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:23,689
I can't be wrong.

476
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:27,192
Wang, stop the car.

477
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:35,300
On our way here, we did pass by
a Chinese drugstore, didn't we?

478
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:40,172
I still remember we were eating the cake
under the tree.

479
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:44,943
The tree is still here,
but the houses are completely different.

480
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,078
Must have been rebuilt.

481
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:47,479
It's different.

482
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,051
-Shancai.
-Yes?

483
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,320
Where are you going?

484
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:56,988
I'll be asking around.

485
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:59,858
Grandpa, if you are sure it's here,
let's ask around.

486
00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:01,727
Maybe they'll know where it moved to.

487
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:02,661
Okay.

488
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,601
Hello, welcome.

489
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:13,004
Miss, for how many?

490
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:14,272
Excuse me.

491
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:18,076
I just want to ask
if you know a nearby bakery?

492
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:20,245
I don't know. Haven't heard of any.

493
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:21,980
Thank you.

494
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:27,018
Several years back,
there definitely was a bakery.

495
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:32,958
I... I just want to ask
if you know where that bakery is now?

496
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:35,093
We've been living here
for more than ten years,

497
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,129
and we've never heard of any bakery.

498
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,798
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

499
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:48,874
Hi, ma'am.

500
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:52,177
We won't be eating here.

501
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,813
May I ask if you know
a bakery around here?

502
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,983
It was here around 30 years ago.

503
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,352
I see. Thank you.

504
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,821
Excuse me, sir and ma'am.

505
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:05,223
Do you know any bakery nearby?

506
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:07,526
I don't know.

507
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,327
-Nearby...
-We come here just to dine.

508
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:11,263
-Sorry for the trouble.
-Thank you.

509
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,257
Seems like it's locked.

510
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:40,959
Let's ask over there.

511
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:45,464
Hi, sir. Excuse me.

512
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,600
-What is it?
-Do you know any bakery nearby?

513
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,002
-I don't know.
-Oh, sorry.

514
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:56,741
Excuse me.

515
00:32:57,409 --> 00:33:00,912
Do you know of any bakery nearby?

516
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,747
There seems to be no bakery nearby.

517
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:03,949
No?

518
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:05,951
I'll ask again.

519
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,356
Excuse me. Anybody home?

520
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,459
Excuse me. Anybody home?

521
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:15,961
What is it?

522
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:17,028
Excuse me, miss.

523
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:20,465
May I ask, do you know any bakery nearby?

524
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:22,767
No, there is no bakery nearby.

525
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,102
Thank you.

526
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,504
-You're welcome.
-Thank you.

527
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:27,472
Let's ask over there.

528
00:33:35,914 --> 00:33:37,148
Anybody home?

529
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,585
Hello, anybody home?

530
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:45,390
Shancai.

531
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:47,125
Forget it.

532
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:49,594
It's been several decades.

533
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:53,565
People can change so much
during these years,

534
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:55,333
let alone a small bakery.

535
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:01,973
No, it can't be. God can't be cruel.

536
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,011
God has been very kind to me.

537
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,380
He's given me several decades.

538
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:11,182
But I didn't save anything.

539
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:16,721
I didn't save anything.

540
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:32,671
Wang, you've worked hard today.

541
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,638
Sir, excuse me.

542
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:36,575
May I ask if you know any bakery nearby?

543
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,878
There is one up ahead that alley.

544
00:34:39,945 --> 00:34:40,912
Right turn on that alley.

545
00:34:40,979 --> 00:34:42,981
-Yes.
-Thank you.

546
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:44,215
Grandpa!

547
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:49,621
-Grandpa!
-What's the matter?

548
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:50,922
I've found it.

549
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:52,357
You've found it?

550
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:53,725
There. Let's go!

551
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,315
Granny, you're awake already?

552
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:52,517
Why are you two sleeping
in the living room?

553
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:54,252
-We...
-We were afraid you will sneak--

554
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,920
I was afraid I will oversleep.

555
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,555
Yes, we were afraid we will oversleep.

556
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,525
Didn't we agree last night
that there will be no send-off?

557
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,260
You think that we agreed?

558
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:03,561
Of course.

559
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,564
-We insist.
-Yes, we insist.

560
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:11,202
All right. Then help me call a taxi.

561
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:12,671
Help me move my luggage.

562
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:14,139
-Okay?
-Oh, all right.

563
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:16,174
The taxi, yes.

564
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:18,176
-What?
-Slowly.

565
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:28,620
Faster!

566
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,288
Hurry!

567
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:31,723
Yes, faster.

568
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:32,957
Very urgent.

569
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,159
Why did you eat so much?

570
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:35,326
You ate it.

571
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:36,227
Throw it away.

572
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:37,262
Do you know how late it is?

573
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:39,330
-All right. Hurrying now.
-We'll move faster.

574
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,634
-Faster!
-Understood.

575
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:45,303
All right. We're hurrying.

576
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,204
Hurry.

577
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:49,607
Granny, why are these things so heavy?

578
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:50,508
Yeah.

579
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:51,676
What did you put in?

580
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,248
Did they arrive yet?

581
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,350
-Not yet.
-What's taking them so long.

582
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:01,686
Yeah, they're making me anxious.

583
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,523
Since you're anxious,
why are you moving so slow?

584
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:07,058
There isn't much luggage,

585
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:09,527
but you've been running back and forth
over ten times.

586
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,529
Granny, this is heavy.

587
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:12,464
Yeah.

588
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,767
Where's the small beige case?

589
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:17,102
-Beige case?
-Beige case?

590
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:19,637
-Look around.
-It's here.

591
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:20,572
No, it's not.

592
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:21,740
Isn't it there a while ago...

593
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:23,274
Can it be inside the car?

594
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:24,209
Yes, look for it.

595
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:29,314
-Is it there?
-It's not here.

596
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,715
-No, it's not here either.
-Is it...

597
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:32,650
Did you accidentally drop it?

598
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:34,252
-Yes, let's take a look.
-It might be...

599
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:38,723
-Is that it? That...
-Is that it?

600
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:39,958
-Which one?
-That one over there.

601
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:41,159
-That black one over there?
-Yes.

602
00:37:41,226 --> 00:37:42,293
That's the tire.

603
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,729
Granny's case is gray, right?

604
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,899
-Yes.
-It's not here.

605
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:49,934
-It's not here.
-It's a beige one!

606
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,703
Beige! Right, beige.

607
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:54,606
-Let me think.
-Did you bring it down?

608
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:56,341
-Me? I did.
-Yes, I remember...

609
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:58,143
I remember you carried it.

610
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,111
Find it quickly.

611
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:01,846
We will. Don't worry, Granny.

612
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:03,281
Go look for it.

613
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:04,449
Second floor.

614
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:05,583
It's on the second floor.

615
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:07,485
Oh, okay...

616
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:09,621
Granny, don't worry.
I'll look for it upstairs. I'll go...

617
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:10,755
And...

618
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:12,624
Oh, no need... All right.

619
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,762
You two are acting strange this morning.

620
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:20,498
Don't think that I can't tell.

621
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,534
What are you up to?

622
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,236
What? Granny, what are you talking about?

623
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,738
Let me help with your luggage, all right?

624
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:28,740
I know you are in a hurry.

625
00:38:31,176 --> 00:38:32,010
Hong.

626
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:44,849
Shancai.

627
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,284
Shancai!

628
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:48,319
Shancai!

629
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,201
Shancai.

630
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:36,100
Shancai, what's the matter?

631
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:39,504
I don't know either.

632
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:45,310
You've spent so much effort
getting Grandpa and Granny together.

633
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:49,213
You should be happy for them,
and even more so for yourself.

634
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:52,583
I am indeed very happy.

635
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:54,552
But...

636
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:57,188
Don't mind me.

637
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,135
I know it.

638
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,671
I know why you're sad.

639
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:18,876
Even I don't know the reason,
so how would you know?

640
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:23,748
Could it be that you're afraid
of your own reunion?

641
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:28,720
Because you're expecting your own reunion.

642
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,503
Tell me what you want to say.

643
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:47,338
I have a plane to catch.

644
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,674
How...

645
00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:51,476
How are you doing?

646
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,912
Great. Can't be better.

647
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:58,750
Are you done?

648
00:41:59,050 --> 00:41:59,884
Hong.

649
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,388
Can you...

650
00:42:05,223 --> 00:42:07,725
Can you give back my happiness?

651
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:08,486
He still bought the wrong one.

652
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:11,089
Men will always be men.

653
00:43:13,391 --> 00:43:15,093
<i>Granny, this dress is very beautiful.</i>

654
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:16,594
Are you really giving it to me?

655
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:20,364
It's been 30 years.

656
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:25,837
I had it made by a tailor
for that birthday date.

657
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:27,772
It's yours now.

658
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:33,344
A 30-year-old dress,
and you have kept it like brand-new.

659
00:43:33,578 --> 00:43:35,413
It's just a dress.

660
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:38,783
After seeing him today,

661
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:42,120
I've realized that I've really aged.

662
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,791
He was bulkier back then.

663
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:51,329
Each time he visited me,
my friends would tell me,

664
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:54,232
"Hong, your big bear is here."

665
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:59,504
Granny, your smile is beautiful.

666
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:02,673
Beautiful? My hair's all white.

667
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:06,410
Do you have regrets?

668
00:44:08,446 --> 00:44:10,114
It's been 30 years.

669
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:13,050
I really admire your stubbornness.

670
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:15,753
Those 30 years,

671
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:17,755
did you regret it even once?

672
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:19,257
Yes, I did.

673
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,160
I regretted once a year.

674
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,398
Thinking about it,
I am really mad at myself.

675
00:44:27,632 --> 00:44:29,233
Why did I keep torturing myself?

676
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:33,404
What would you do
to make up for the 30 years?

677
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:35,006
Make up for what?

678
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,575
I am moving to Canada as planned.

679
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:41,479
Why? What about Mr. Gao?

680
00:44:41,913 --> 00:44:42,914
Him?

681
00:44:44,315 --> 00:44:45,917
He's going with me.

682
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:50,988
Granny.

683
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,559
I hate to see you go.

684
00:44:55,126 --> 00:44:56,827
But I'm really happy for you.

685
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:01,532
Granny, I have a question.

686
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:03,000
Ask away.

687
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:06,237
Is the sponge cake really that delicious?

688
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:09,073
Think about it.

689
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:17,014
Is there anything sweeter than two lovers
eating a cake bite after bite?

690
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:01,385
