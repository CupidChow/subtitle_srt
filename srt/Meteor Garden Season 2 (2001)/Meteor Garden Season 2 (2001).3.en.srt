1
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:11,231
Sha.

2
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,199
How is he?

3
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,601
I think you shouldn't mind him anymore.

4
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,503
When he gets hungry, he will eat.

5
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,271
When worse comes to worst,
he'll starve to death.

6
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,590
Look. That's how he acts.

7
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,131
You people.

8
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,434
I don't care anymore.

9
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,268
I know that you're already awake.

10
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:58,405
I just brought you some fresh flowers

11
00:03:58,472 --> 00:03:59,406
and I wanted to ask you

12
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:01,374
if you want to have breakfast
with me and Sha?

13
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,879
You need to eat something.

14
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,751
I'll bring your breakfast here, okay?

15
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,723
Silence means yes.

16
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,958
All right. I'll go get it.

17
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,111
Your breakfast is here.

18
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,818
I'll... leave it here then.

19
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:46,086
I'll go away.

20
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,522
I won't take a peek at you eating.

21
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,457
I really won't.

22
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:52,793
I'm putting it down.

23
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,147
Who am I?

24
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,883
Actually, I often ask myself
this question, too.

25
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:52,919
Even if I know who I am,

26
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:54,054
so what then?

27
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:56,556
My name is Yesha.

28
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,992
I came from a faraway place.

29
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,794
I paint for a living.

30
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,363
My good friend Sha took me in.

31
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,565
However,

32
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,834
even if I know my name,

33
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:08,935
my identity,

34
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:10,237
my background,

35
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,404
so what?

36
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,908
I still don't know who I am.

37
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:21,147
I still don't know why I'm alive
and when my life will end.

38
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:24,718
That's why I've been traveling
and wandering around everywhere

39
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:27,754
to make friends and see the world.

40
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:31,291
I search for the answer while traveling.

41
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:33,693
Slowly...

42
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,796
I began to know who I am.

43
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,101
Who are you then?

44
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,070
You might not know right now.

45
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,306
However,

46
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:50,043
this may be a good opportunity
for you to get to know yourself again.

47
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:18,805
What's the matter?

48
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,674
Hey, what's the matter?

49
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:22,776
Go away!

50
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:33,019
What's the matter? Open the door!

51
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:34,587
I told you to leave! Do you hear me?

52
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:37,457
Fine, I'll leave.

53
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:38,458
I'll leave.

54
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,794
As long as you don't hurt yourself,
I'll just leave.

55
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,395
Go away!

56
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:14,227
Miss Shancai.

57
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:15,762
I'm giving my happiness to you.

58
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,281
I got it now.

59
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,817
Daoming Si.

60
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,053
I got it now.

61
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,655
Open the door, Shancai.

62
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,791
Let me in, Shancai.

63
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,127
Shancai!

64
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,462
Shancai, what are you doing?

65
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,498
Do you think that Ah Si would appear
if you act this way?

66
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,600
Shancai, open the door!

67
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,001
-Meizuo.
-Shancai, open the door!

68
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:56,069
Meizuo.

69
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,370
Lei.

70
00:08:58,571 --> 00:08:59,606
I'm going back to sleep.

71
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,143
You can still sleep at a time like this?

72
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,044
Meizuo!

73
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,478
Do you want to make this even worse?

74
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,613
Is this my fault?

75
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,314
I know you're worried
about Ah Si and Shancai.

76
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,050
-But you--
-But whatever I do is wrong!

77
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,453
-It's not wrong, it just that you--
-Did I say anything wrong?

78
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,854
Did I do anything wrong?

79
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,556
Should we just watch Shancai
torture herself?

80
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:18,291
Then go to sleep
when we can't take it anymore?

81
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,026
-Do you have to be so emotional about it?
-Am I?

82
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:21,961
Calm down, both of you.

83
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:28,134
Let's go out and settle this outside.

84
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,256
Didn't you want to settle it here?

85
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:52,525
Meizuo.

86
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,627
Shancai is near the point of breakdown.

87
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,062
We're the only ones who can help her.

88
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,031
Shouldn't we stay calm?

89
00:09:58,631 --> 00:09:59,699
Do you think I don't want to?

90
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,501
Tell me. How are we going to calm down?

91
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,303
There's nothing that we can do

92
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,971
with Shancai's pain
and Ah Si's disappearance.

93
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:07,040
Tell me. How are we going to calm down?

94
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,308
Meizuo.

95
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,277
From the time we were little until now,

96
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,147
this is the first time we've encountered
a problem we cannot solve.

97
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:19,686
And it's the first time I've realized
that F4 are just ordinary people.

98
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,155
After graduating from Yingde,

99
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,892
"F4" is just a synonym for friendship.

100
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,895
If our friendship can't even stand
the test of time,

101
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,832
I think it's time for us
to disband here in Spain.

102
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,668
Disband?

103
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,938
Do you want to look for three Spaniards
to form another F4?

104
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,543
Then you can't be called F4.

105
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,544
You have to be S4.

106
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,983
Don't even think about it.

107
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,651
Don't think I'll let you get away with it.

108
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:54,954
So what should we do?

109
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,824
Are we going to disband or not?

110
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,396
Do I have the honor

111
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:05,365
to invite both lifetime members
for a drink?

112
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,535
Sure, let's go.

113
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:11,871
-Which one should we go to?
-Wait.

114
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,676
Since we won't disband,

115
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,245
I want to make one thing clear.

116
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:21,447
What's so serious?

117
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,018
That is, from now on...

118
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:27,754
you absolutely cannot

119
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,290
ban me from sleeping.

120
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,963
Shancai is missing!

121
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,163
-Meizuo.
-Have you found her?

122
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,498
-No.
-How about that side?

123
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,832
-No.
-You go that way.

124
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,234
We'll go this way.

125
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:26,726
Where are you taking me?

126
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:28,661
Lei, let go of me!

127
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:30,596
Where are you taking me? Lei!

128
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,266
Let me go.

129
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,402
Aren't you looking for Ah Si?

130
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,504
Daoming Si is here?

131
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:41,841
I don't know.

132
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,012
I only knew that he got lost.

133
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,150
You miss Ah Si.

134
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:53,853
He surely misses you more.

135
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,323
You want to see him.

136
00:15:58,491 --> 00:15:59,992
He surely wants to see you more.

137
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,397
So it's not that you cannot find Ah Si.

138
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:07,934
It's Ah Si who cannot find you.

139
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:10,870
Shancai.

140
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,140
Ah Si got lost

141
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:16,642
and cannot come home.

142
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,801
Maybe he's in a place
where there's neither the sun nor moon

143
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,505
and there's neither stars nor lights.

144
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,908
Your voice is the only thing

145
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,911
that can point him in the right direction.

146
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:54,914
So, Shancai,

147
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:57,283
shout your heart out.

148
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,922
Couldn't you see
that Ah Si is just right there?

149
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:08,761
If you don't call him,

150
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,097
how can he see you

151
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,332
even if he turned his head back?

152
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,505
Daoming Si.

153
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,477
Daoming Si!

154
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,346
Where are you?

155
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:34,520
Daoming Si!

156
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,822
Are you there?

157
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,559
I'm Shancai!

158
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,929
Where are you?

159
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,071
Daoming Si!

160
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,908
I miss you so much!

161
00:17:57,476 --> 00:18:00,012
I really, really miss you.

162
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,416
Daoming Si.

163
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:07,119
Please come back, okay?

164
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:12,325
Daoming Si!

165
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:16,128
Daoming Si!

166
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,700
<i>Daoming Si!</i>

167
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,758
Hey, my star is out.

168
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:48,594
I'm not kidding.

169
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:49,996
It's really my star.

170
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,897
I call it "Brave Yesha."

171
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,605
Do you know why it's my star?

172
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,509
That year,

173
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:05,177
I joined a summer camp

174
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,914
and got lost because I wandered around
and separated from the group.

175
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:11,984
Alone in the mountains,

176
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:13,252
I didn't know what to do.

177
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:16,622
As the sky got darker,

178
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,492
I got more scared.

179
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:23,462
Then it appeared.

180
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,564
It was very bright.

181
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:27,700
It seemed to be telling me,

182
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,036
"Yesha,

183
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,604
there's nothing to fear.

184
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:32,972
You can surely do it."

185
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,476
In the end,
I really found my way back to camp.

186
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,880
That's why I call it "Brave Yesha."

187
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,283
Hello, Brave Yesha.

188
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,655
You're so lucky.

189
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:53,859
My Brave Yesha cannot be seen easily.

190
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,297
It's so naughty. It's always hiding.

191
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,635
When I feel sad,

192
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,705
I would go to a wide, empty space

193
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:07,606
and wait for it to appear.

194
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:11,210
If it doesn't appear tonight,

195
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:13,713
it sure will tomorrow

196
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:16,215
or the day after

197
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:18,050
or the day after that.

198
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,053
I would keep on waiting.

199
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:26,926
Later on, I realized...

200
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:31,163
that there's also beauty in waiting.

201
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,900
To wait for the star.

202
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:37,303
To wait for inspiration.

203
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,340
To wait for the grapes to ripen.

204
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,977
To wait for the wine to age.

205
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,649
When you're physically fit
and have enough endurance,

206
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,186
waiting is a kind of "discovery."

207
00:20:56,122 --> 00:21:00,292
It lets you rediscover
the many things that passed me by,

208
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,761
but I fail to take notice of.

209
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:09,568
Turns out I missed out
on so many beautiful things.

210
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,845
I believe that you must have missed out
some things, too.

211
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:21,914
For instance,

212
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:23,849
good food.

213
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,857
I wonder what good food Sha cooked for us.

214
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:37,296
I know you're not interested,
but I can't miss out on this.

215
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,565
I won't bother you anymore.

216
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,067
Just stand here
and continue missing out on everything.

217
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:10,429
Don't wait for him. Let's eat first.

218
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:11,797
Let's wait for him a bit longer, Sha.

219
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:14,700
-He should be here soon.
-Oh, please. We've waited for so long.

220
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,035
Be more patient.

221
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,138
-Hey, he's back.
-He's back.

222
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:20,339
We can eat then.

223
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:30,449
Come on, let's eat together.

224
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:34,887
Let's eat.

225
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:36,856
Come.

226
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:05,885
Yesha.

227
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:10,322
Until when will he stare blankly
like that?

228
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:13,025
He's thinking.

229
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:14,894
Thinking?

230
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,830
If he can really think things through,

231
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:18,864
I would...

232
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:27,039
These are all delicious.
Don't be shy. Eat whatever you want.

233
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:35,915
Sha.

234
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:37,750
Yes.

235
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:39,418
How can you not eat anything?

236
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:40,953
Come on, eat a little.

237
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:48,427
Don't just stare at me, okay?

238
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,162
Try them.

239
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,498
I worked in a restaurant before.

240
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:55,334
I learned how to make these dishes
the past few years in Spain.

241
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:57,870
These are local specialties.
They're delicious.

242
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,705
-Get up.
-Where are we going?

243
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,507
How can he eat with us around? Let's go!

244
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:02,441
This is my house.

245
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:03,676
Let's go.

246
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:41,480
Stop looking at him.

247
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:42,948
Wait.

248
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:45,250
Don't look at him.

249
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:47,052
I get it now.

250
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:50,322
I didn't know you were a chef before.

251
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:52,758
I was just a runner.

252
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,495
Didn't you say
you worked in a restaurant before?

253
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,031
I ruined a restaurant before.

254
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:02,234
Do you know that when there
were many customers,

255
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:04,536
I would panic and break some plates?

256
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,138
If there are only a few customers,

257
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:07,639
I would chat with them

258
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,609
and get tipsy after drinking a few glasses
of wine, then break some more plates.

259
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:11,777
Tell me. It would be strange

260
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:14,279
if the restaurant wouldn't close down
because of what I was doing.

261
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,492
Never mind that he wouldn't eat
the dishes I cooked.

262
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:28,193
He wouldn't even laugh at my jokes.

263
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:29,895
I'll go take a look.

264
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,300
You're not eating the dishes
I cooked either.

265
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:00,759
I know you find me troublesome.

266
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:04,496
But at least let me help you
apply some medicine on your hand, okay?

267
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:07,499
Listen to me!

268
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:23,549
Hurting yourself and this stupid way
of shutting yourself out

269
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,884
won't help in recovering your memory.

270
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:29,121
You can use a scientific way.

271
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:30,989
For instance,

272
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:32,858
you can speak Chinese.

273
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:35,994
Chinese is not the only place

274
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:37,729
where there are people
who can speak Chinese.

275
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,466
Sha is from Taiwan.

276
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,634
He also speaks Chinese.

277
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:46,738
And there's Singapore, Malaysia.

278
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:49,842
You can think hard

279
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:52,111
if you have some impressions
of these places.

280
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,746
China,

281
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,950
Taiwan, Singapore,

282
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:00,419
Malaysia.

283
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:11,997
Don't rush.

284
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:13,599
Take it slow.

285
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,603
I know!

286
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:19,104
You haven't eaten anything.

287
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:20,372
You don't have enough nutrients.

288
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:21,907
That's why you cannot think.

289
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:24,743
I'll help you bring your dinner here.

290
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,446
Eat something so you can think well.

291
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:29,481
I'll go get it.

292
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,689
I'll be back soon.

293
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:57,409
What happened to you?

294
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:03,315
Perhaps I was too tired during the day.

295
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:05,083
My legs hurt.

296
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,528
Sha.

297
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:25,604
All right.

298
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,105
Take it slow. Lie down.

299
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:31,677
Do you feel better?

300
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:34,479
It's really strange.

301
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:36,815
The pain is gone when you arrive.

302
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:46,458
There's a Chinese saying that goes,

303
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,794
"A man driven to desperation
can do anything."

304
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,229
I just realized today

305
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,298
that a mute person
driven to desperation can also talk.

306
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:57,135
Do you want to drink some more?

307
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:58,203
Okay.

308
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:28,834
Friend.

309
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,536
Hey, friend!

310
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:35,807
Do you see them? They're small and black.

311
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:37,175
These grapes are not ripe yet,

312
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:38,543
but they will be very soon.

313
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:40,912
Hello, friends!

314
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:45,350
Actually, all the barrels,

315
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:48,420
the whole winery
do not contain the same thing.

316
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:51,456
Come over here.
It's because it's grade is different,

317
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:53,258
the taste after it ages
is also not the same.

318
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:54,693
Come, over here.

319
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,627
For the small barrels,

320
00:29:55,694 --> 00:29:59,398
what's inside of them
are even of a higher grade.

321
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,632
They also have a higher value.

322
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:06,972
-Hello.
-Hello.

323
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:11,643
Look at the place.

324
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,912
The feeling inside the cellar is...

325
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:17,549
I think, later on,

326
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:20,218
we should open a bottle of wine
to celebrate.

327
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:21,453
What's there to celebrate about?

328
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:23,522
At least...

329
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:27,292
Shouldn't we celebrate the fact
that he said my name for the first time?

330
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:30,662
Of course, we should celebrate.
We should really celebrate.

331
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:32,030
Okay?

332
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:37,803
Cheers!

333
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:46,111
Grape leaves are beautiful, aren't they?

334
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:52,651
I told you. It feels really good
to discover the little things in life.

335
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:55,520
That's why I write a journal daily.

336
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,323
I write down everything
I've discovered daily.

337
00:30:59,091 --> 00:31:00,859
However, I hated being forced
to do things.

338
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:03,929
I remembered the first time our teacher
asked us to submit

339
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,664
a journal as an assignment.

340
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:07,566
I got mad and submitted
the drawing of a toilet bowl.

341
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,601
You submitted a toilet bowl drawing?

342
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:12,938
-Then I'm much better than you.
-Really?

343
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:15,040
-I wrote down six words.
-Which six words?

344
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:17,876
"Teacher, I don't know how to write."

345
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:25,117
We opened this bottle for you.

346
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:26,218
Try it.

347
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,646
The color, aroma, and flavor
are adequately balanced.

348
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:59,384
Hey, you also know how to drink wine?

349
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:03,255
Oh. No, I mean
you also know how to taste wine?

350
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:06,158
Is it difficult?

351
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,496
It took me 800 years to learn wine tasting

352
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:15,600
and another 800 years
to know all about grapes.

353
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:19,137
Then another 1,800 years to make wine.

354
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:21,573
Are you a monster?

355
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,808
Hey...

356
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:24,676
Don't call me "hey."

357
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:27,612
"Ey."

358
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:33,051
How about we give you a name?

359
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,455
What do you want people to call you?

360
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,858
Don't even think that I'll call you
"handsome guy."

361
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,862
I don't want you to give me a name.

362
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:45,630
I used to have a name.

363
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:51,503
It's my fault.

364
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:53,839
It's all my fault.

365
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,508
He finally cheered up a bit.

366
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:58,376
Blame it on my stupidity.

367
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,079
I caused all this trouble.
Of course, it's my fault.

368
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,180
No. It's my fault.

369
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,049
I offended him.

370
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,217
If anyone is at fault, it's me.

371
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:06,918
It's my fault.

372
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,554
I beg you, please, let me win.

373
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:10,956
It's my fault this time, okay?

374
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:12,491
It's my fault.

375
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:53,698
THROUGH THE STARS ABOVE THEIR HEADS,
THE LOST FIND THEIR WAY HOME

376
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,734
THROUGH THE STARS IN YOUR HEART,
YOU WON'T FORGET ME

377
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,736
ONE MILLION, TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND
LIGHT YEARS APART,

378
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:59,704
"AH SING" AND HIS PAST
ARE CURRENTLY SEARCHING

379
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:01,206
FOR A RESPONSE FROM EACH OTHER

380
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:11,483
Good night.

381
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,051
Ah Xing.

382
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:20,358
Good night.

383
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:13,845
Shancai, she--

384
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:16,147
Don't talk.

385
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:21,086
Lei.

386
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,154
I missed you so much.

387
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:29,894
I want to leave France.

388
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:31,630
What do you think?

389
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,234
You know about this.

390
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:39,404
I'm not interested
in other people's affairs.

391
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:48,613
You found someone you like.

392
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:50,348
Am I right?

393
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:55,954
Is she someone I know?

394
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:01,259
Is it... Shancai?

395
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,006
In my heart,

396
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,778
you used to have a very important place.

397
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:24,983
But now,

398
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:26,785
we're just friends.

399
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:29,788
We'll always be friends forever.

400
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:45,370
Still no news?

401
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:49,174
Please continue to track him down.

402
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,809
Please contact us once there's news, okay?

403
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,915
All right. That's all. Thank you.

404
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,022
There's only one possibility now.

405
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:05,824
Ah Si's mother.

406
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,394
I'll make a call to New York
to check then.

407
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:12,997
If Ah Si is really with his mother,

408
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:16,501
it's useless even if we call her.

409
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:25,410
Based on his mother's personality,

410
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:27,712
she would definitely keep it a secret.

411
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:37,455
Shancai.

412
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:44,696
I'll call her.

413
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,118
What right do you have to call me?

414
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:09,020
<i>It's you, right?</i>

415
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:10,655
The nerve!

416
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:12,690
Mind your manners!

417
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,693
Where exactly did you hide Daoming Si?

418
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:17,629
Please tell me quickly, okay?

419
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:19,497
Otherwise, how would he disappear
without a trace?

420
00:38:20,832 --> 00:38:21,933
Ah Si is missing?

421
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,305
Ah Si can walk by himself.

422
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:29,707
I can't control him even if I want to.

423
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:31,709
What more, you?

424
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:34,579
<i>Miss Shancai.</i>

425
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:37,115
I already told you before.

426
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:40,051
Ah Si's curiosity has always been limited.

427
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,720
When he's tired with his toys,

428
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,722
he would never be reluctant
to part with them.

429
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,326
I think the reason Ah Si disappeared

430
00:38:48,393 --> 00:38:50,128
is because he doesn't want you
to find him.

431
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:51,830
That's impossible!

432
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:53,498
<i>Why is it impossible?</i>

433
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:56,034
Hasn't he suffered enough because of you?

434
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:58,870
<i>Because of you, he lost the happiness
he originally had.</i>

435
00:38:59,237 --> 00:39:01,005
He lost my trust.

436
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:02,874
Why do you deserve to have him?

437
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:05,910
<i>You let him handle all the pressure.</i>

438
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:09,447
<i>Everything that's happening to him now
is all because of your selfishness.</i>

439
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,486
If you have nothing else to say,

440
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:16,654
I'm hanging up.

441
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:17,822
<i>Wait.</i>

442
00:39:18,623 --> 00:39:19,591
All right.

443
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:20,892
I promise you.

444
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:24,162
If you tell me that you were the one
who took Daoming Si away

445
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:25,797
and that he's safe right now,

446
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,799
then I swear that from now on,

447
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,368
I will never ever appear
in front of him again.

448
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:36,040
What a shame.

449
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:37,508
Miss Shancai.

450
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:42,046
I've also lost my trust in your promises.

451
00:39:44,282 --> 00:39:45,283
I beg you.

452
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,151
I swear.

453
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,153
I'm willing to accept any condition

454
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:51,589
as long as you tell me
that he's safe with you.

455
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:56,394
Okay.

456
00:39:56,461 --> 00:39:58,396
Seeing that you are sincere,

457
00:39:58,463 --> 00:39:59,664
I will tell you.

458
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:01,532
You're right.

459
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,702
Ah Si is safe here in New York.

460
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,304
He's doing very well.

461
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:09,908
Please remember what you've said.

462
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:13,478
Don't appear in front
of Daoming Si ever again.

463
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:26,724
Contact Barcelona immediately.

464
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:28,793
It's really her.

465
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,603
At least I know that he's safe.

466
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:45,076
Let's now go to New York
to find Ah Si now.

467
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:46,377
Let's go back to Taiwan.

468
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:50,715
I believe that Ah Si has a way
to go back to Taiwan and meet us.

469
00:41:07,098 --> 00:41:08,599
-Can you do it?
-Yes.

470
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:30,254
So wonderful!

471
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,423
I should draw your back views.

472
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,658
No way.

473
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:35,493
The expression of my back
is not good today.

474
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,928
You should draw Ah Xing's back.

475
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:38,062
Do you know?

476
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:40,631
Yesha is very talented
in drawing people's back views.

477
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:43,368
Every back she draws
has different expressions.

478
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:47,105
Why does she only draw back views?

479
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,307
Because nobody sees his own back.

480
00:41:51,142 --> 00:41:52,677
By the way,
your clothes are already washed.

481
00:41:52,744 --> 00:41:53,945
-They're in your room.
-Okay.

482
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:55,279
By the way, what is this?

483
00:41:56,748 --> 00:41:57,915
Is this yours?

484
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:00,485
What is Longshan Temple?

485
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:01,986
Longshan Temple?

486
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:04,689
It's a very famous temple in Taipei.

487
00:42:04,756 --> 00:42:06,224
Taipei?

488
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:09,227
You're wearing something
from Longshan Temple.

489
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:11,696
And Longshan Temple is in Taipei. So...

490
00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:13,631
Therefore...

491
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:15,733
Perhaps, possibly...

492
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:18,603
-You're from Taipei.
-You're from Taipei.

493
00:42:18,803 --> 00:42:20,638
Marvelous, we have a lead!

494
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,409
Cheer up, Ah Sing.

495
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,577
We'll go to the Taipei Economic
and Cultural Office tomorrow.

496
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:29,047
You can quickly find the star
that can lead your way back home.

497
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:33,151
Come here for a second.

498
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:35,787
Why?

499
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:38,222
I'll take you somewhere
before you go home.

500
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:39,123
Where?

501
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:41,159
Why won't you let me listen
to what you're saying?

502
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,061
It's a secret.

503
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:52,603
Ah Xing, hurry!

504
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:53,538
Hurry!

505
00:42:54,005 --> 00:42:54,906
Look!

506
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:56,774
Take a look!

507
00:42:57,508 --> 00:42:58,576
Isn't it beautiful?

508
00:43:03,481 --> 00:43:04,916
Do you know how lucky you are?

509
00:43:06,484 --> 00:43:09,253
You're lucky enough to encounter
a very special holiday in Barcelona.

510
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,656
Sant Joan, Saint John.

511
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:13,758
Do you see everyone
playing with fireworks?

512
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,693
The use of fire represents

513
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,696
burning and driving away
all the bad things,

514
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,565
all the demons and monsters.

515
00:43:21,499 --> 00:43:25,269
After burning them,
tomorrow will be a new beginning.

516
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,171
Just like you.

517
00:43:27,238 --> 00:43:30,007
Tomorrow is your new beginning.

518
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:35,913
Let's also light up some fireworks.

519
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:38,983
All right? Come on!

520
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,187
Let's light up some fireworks!

521
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:28,566
-Please fill out this form over there.
-Okay.

522
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,002
If there's any news
about this missing youth,

523
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:32,803
I'll contact you immediately, okay?

524
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:33,971
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

525
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:34,872
Over there.

526
