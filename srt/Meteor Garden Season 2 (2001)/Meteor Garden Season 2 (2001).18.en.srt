1
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,802
We should talk to Ah Si.

2
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:18,538
What for?

3
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:20,907
To ask him face to face.

4
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:22,576
Fine.

5
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,810
I'll go with you.

6
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,912
-Let's go.
-Meizuo.

7
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:28,749
Do you remember what Ah Si said?

8
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:32,119
Regardless of what he said,

9
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:35,288
it's impossible for Yesha
to be engaged to Ah Xing.

10
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,225
You keep saying it's impossible.

11
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:39,726
Why exactly is that?

12
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:40,827
That's because...

13
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,132
Because...

14
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,867
Because Yesha doesn't love Daoming Si.

15
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,571
Yesha told me she's not in love
with Daoming Si.

16
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:52,639
She really said that.

17
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:56,810
That means...

18
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,148
this is not just a simple engagement.

19
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:02,716
That's right.

20
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,752
Someone must have set her up.

21
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:06,653
However,

22
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:08,855
who would set her up?

23
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:18,331
Hey.

24
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:21,401
It's you.

25
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,240
Is there a need for this?

26
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,379
Okay, I'll be there.

27
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:40,520
Daoming Feng wants to meet me.

28
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:43,590
Excuse me.

29
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:44,591
Excuse me.

30
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:47,160
Excuse me.

31
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:49,396
Excuse me.

32
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:50,731
Welcome.

33
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:52,499
Welcome.

34
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:13,653
Thank you.

35
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:20,160
Thank you.

36
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:25,766
Shancai,

37
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,768
you haven't eaten, right?

38
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:34,541
See if you like any of these dishes.

39
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:36,910
Thank you.

40
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:37,911
I'm not hungry now.

41
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,580
Tell me what you want.

42
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:46,186
That's good.

43
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,256
I'll get straight to the point then.

44
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,593
Shancai,

45
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,229
you know very well

46
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:58,865
I've never liked you.

47
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,603
I still don't.

48
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,110
Ah Si is already engaged.

49
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:13,780
I know.

50
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,319
Ah Si loves Yesha now.

51
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,129
I'm very happy to become

52
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,965
in-laws with a royal family.

53
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:37,971
This is considered icing on the cake
to the Daoming family.

54
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,476
The Bhutan monarchy itself is not rich.

55
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:45,979
To put it simply,

56
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,281
one side of this marriage

57
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,951
wants fame,

58
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,352
the other desires financial gain.

59
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,422
You can say it's a win-win situation.

60
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:59,593
Why are you telling me these things?

61
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:04,798
Because Yesha doesn't love Ah Si.

62
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,202
She just agreed to this engagement

63
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:12,205
for the sake of our families.

64
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:14,808
What does that mean?

65
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:18,945
That means

66
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,250
that this engagement will end
once Daoming Corp. gets the royal prestige

67
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:28,989
and Yesha's father
gets his financial support.

68
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,393
You're doing all this for fame,
but what about Daoming Si?

69
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:36,997
Of course.

70
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,667
I don't want them
to cancel the engagement.

71
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:45,038
Ah Si losing his memory
and falling in love with Yesha

72
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:46,573
is an unexpected situation.

73
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:50,810
However, Yesha doesn't love Ah Si.

74
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:52,913
This is a fact.

75
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:57,350
So to prevent Ah Si from hating me
in the future,

76
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,757
I only hope he regains his memory
before the engagement ends.

77
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,026
And...

78
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,528
I'm also giving you one last chance.

79
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,499
I promised you before

80
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,268
that I owe you one chance.

81
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,240
What kind of chance are you giving me?

82
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:25,312
From now on, you can work
at Daoming Corporation.

83
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:30,717
That gives you a chance to see Ah Si
and be in contact with him.

84
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:46,032
However,
whether or not you can win his heart back

85
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,070
is all up to you.

86
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:54,407
I don't understand.

87
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,476
Don't you consider me an unpleasant weed,

88
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:57,811
a stumbling block?

89
00:07:58,511 --> 00:07:59,913
Why are you giving me this chance?

90
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:01,648
I told you.

91
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,184
I still don't like you.

92
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:08,121
However,

93
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,390
I have to admit I saw

94
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:13,860
how much you love Ah Si

95
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,262
all this time.

96
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:21,134
I think that maybe only you

97
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,170
are willing to give up everything for him.

98
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:28,942
That is the answer.

99
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:34,014
Giving you a chance

100
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,283
doesn't mean I'm willing to accept you.

101
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:42,455
A chance is just a chance.

102
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,998
Thank you for giving me this chance.

103
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,334
But I don't want to be your accomplice
in lying to Daoming Si.

104
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,441
I'll still give you one day to consider.

105
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,246
Because the main focus of all this
is not me,

106
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,314
but the innocent Ah Si.

107
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,620
If you still decide to give up,

108
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:16,489
then you don't need to give me an answer.

109
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:22,262
I, Daoming Feng,
don't have time for a loser.

110
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,044
Madam.

111
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,938
Here, have some Coke.

112
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,474
Okay, Mrs. Dong.
You should eat something too.

113
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:32,866
Shancai.

114
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:41,441
Are you all right, Shancai?

115
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:49,449
Did you see Yesha?

116
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:52,485
What did Mrs. Daoming say?

117
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,954
Did she show off, threaten you,

118
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:55,855
or she...

119
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:56,890
None of the above.

120
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,325
Thank you for your concern.

121
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,628
However, I'm so confused now.

122
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,329
I'm really confused.

123
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,699
Can I tell you after I have
thought about it carefully?

124
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,769
So we waited the whole night for nothing?

125
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:11,171
Sha,

126
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:13,806
give Shancai time to think.

127
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,776
I don't believe

128
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,611
you don't want to know the answer now.

129
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,180
Shancai put up a brave front all day.

130
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,448
We should let her face her own emotions.

131
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:30,924
Meizuo.

132
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,232
Get a good sleep if you can't
think it through.

133
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,936
If you really can't figure it out,
remember that we're just here.

134
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:46,272
Hey!

135
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:49,642
Shancai.

136
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:52,445
Did she mention anything?

137
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:53,680
Let Shancai rest.

138
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,014
Save it for tomorrow.

139
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:56,783
Did she?

140
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:58,918
Good night.

141
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,170
<i>That means</i>

142
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:21,341
this engagement will end
once Daoming Corp. gets the royal prestige

143
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,577
and Yesha's father

144
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,980
gets his financial support.

145
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,116
<i>I only hope he regains his memory</i>

146
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,651
<i>before the engagement ends.</i>

147
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,387
And...

148
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,356
I'm also giving you one last chance.

149
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,293
I promised you before

150
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,296
<i>that I owe you one chance.</i>

151
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:47,934
<i>What should I do?</i>

152
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:49,068
<i>What should I do?</i>

153
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,637
<i>Yesha doesn't love Daoming Si.</i>

154
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,105
<i>Daoming Si doesn't love me.</i>

155
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,373
<i>They're engaged.</i>

156
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,974
<i>However, I have a chance.</i>

157
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,477
<i>What should I do?</i>

158
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,679
<i>What exactly should I do?</i>

159
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:21,934
What are you doing?

160
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:28,274
Are you trying to test
if my is heart strong enough?

161
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:31,978
You went missing,

162
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,379
got engaged,

163
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,181
and now you're here to scare me.

164
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,818
Okay.

165
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,888
What exactly do you want? Say it.

166
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,691
You're such a bad friend.

167
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,027
You know I'm engaged,
and yet you're not congratulating me.

168
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:49,495
Congratulate you?

169
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,801
Do you think I'm so stupid
that I can't tell you're unhappy?

170
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,970
You take your own marriage so lightly
and you want me to congratulate you?

171
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,342
Who says I'm unhappy?

172
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,210
I'm very happy.

173
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:05,511
Really.

174
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,147
I just thought things through.

175
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:11,017
Since I like Ah Si so much,

176
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:13,353
why not enjoy this short period
of happiness?

177
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,021
Anyway...

178
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,290
Anyway, I'm...

179
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,224
Say it.

180
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:20,793
Say it. Why won't you say it?

181
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,765
You're not good at lying.

182
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:32,705
You can lie to everyone in the world,
but you won't come here and lie to me.

183
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,775
That's why I need you, Sha.

184
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:42,648
I feel like I'm not myself
when you're not beside me.

185
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,551
Please help me, okay?

186
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,455
Go back with me to that cold place, okay?

187
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:51,791
Sure,

188
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,594
if you'll tell me the truth.

189
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,630
Then you also have to promise me

190
00:14:57,697 --> 00:15:00,433
that you won't leave the Daoming household
for three months,

191
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,170
and you won't tell anyone
what we discussed today.

192
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:10,610
I'm telling you the truth.

193
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:12,645
I'm engaged.

194
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,180
I'm happy.

195
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,148
Very happy.

196
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:25,892
Then you don't need me beside you, right?

197
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,193
Sha.

198
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,366
This is my problem.

199
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:37,904
I can't bear to see someone
treating themselves horribly,

200
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:43,576
especially if I tried my best to protect
and take care of that person.

201
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:50,650
So,

202
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,355
it's better if you're out of my sight.

203
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:58,057
Please leave.

204
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,139
I'm leaving.

205
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:18,978
I'm going back to that cold place alone.

206
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,250
You might not see me again.

207
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:33,759
Sha.

208
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:37,563
No matter where I am,

209
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:39,599
please remember,

210
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,969
you're my best friend.

211
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:30,216
Stop reading that newspaper, okay?

212
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:35,655
Mom,

213
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:38,057
take that newspaper away...

214
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:39,492
or else,

215
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,295
Shancai will surely be sad
if she sees that.

216
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:44,730
That Daoming Si

217
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,966
doesn't have any conscience.

218
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,271
He's marrying a princess.

219
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:55,207
We're just ordinary citizens.

220
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:57,043
So what if he has a conscience?

221
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:58,644
What are we compared to them?

222
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:01,080
What princess?

223
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,382
From Bhutan?

224
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,483
What a joke!

225
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,887
Maybe if people like us migrate there,

226
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:09,355
even you can become the king

227
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,990
and I, the queen.

228
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:14,160
They're just indigenous people.

229
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,095
Aboriginals who have not evolved.

230
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,430
Every day, they're just...

231
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:21,334
Like that, right?

232
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,703
If Daoming Si wants to marry
an aboriginal,

233
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,137
let him.

234
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:29,075
He's just...

235
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,276
Shancai.

236
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:31,978
Shancai.

237
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,512
You're awake.

238
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,615
Come on... Let's have breakfast together.

239
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:36,515
Mom, Dad.

240
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:37,817
I want to say something.

241
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,986
Tell your mom if you have
something to say.

242
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,887
-Yes.
-I'm going to work now.

243
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,822
That's right.

244
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,156
Actually, Daoming Si...

245
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,825
I've decided to drop out of school.

246
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:46,726
What?

247
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:48,794
Drop out?

248
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:51,697
I've decided to work for Daoming Corp.

249
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,368
Well... are you feeling too sad?

250
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,637
Or... you've lost your mind?

251
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:58,771
Dad,

252
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,640
this might be my last chance.

253
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,110
Although Daoming Si is engaged,

254
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,545
I still want to fight for my love
one more time.

255
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:08,447
At... this moment...

256
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:09,382
I don't want to give up.

257
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,718
Don't give up.

258
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:14,387
That's right. Don't give up!

259
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,722
We only live once.

260
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,358
We must fight for our love until the end.

261
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,527
I fully support you.

262
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:22,495
Okay?

263
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:23,562
Dad!

264
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:32,104
I have nothing to be proud of in my life.

265
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,408
However, there's one thing

266
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:37,710
that makes me smile
even in my dreams at night.

267
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,847
And that is having such a tough daughter.

268
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:47,119
She is my true princess.

269
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:50,322
Dad.

270
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:53,926
Shancai.

271
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:55,227
Thank you, Mom.

272
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:00,933
I heard Daoming Si got engaged
to a princess.

273
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,001
That's so cool.

274
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:03,836
Hey... Then... what about that Shancai?

275
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:06,472
I heard she's dropping out.

276
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,807
I told you...

277
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,875
-she'd get dumped sooner or later.
-Shancai!

278
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:14,080
Are you all right?

279
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:15,981
Qinghe.

280
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,687
Why are you dropping out?

281
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,557
Why are you giving up on yourself
for that Daoming Si

282
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:25,791
who lost his memory?

283
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:26,792
Why?

284
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:29,862
Because I want to fight for my love.

285
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:31,330
I want to make an effort one last time.

286
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,632
Make an effort one last time?

287
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:36,035
Fine.

288
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:37,536
If you drop out, I'll drop out too.

289
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,972
Let's go beat Daoming Si
until he snaps out of it.

290
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:42,007
Qinghe,

291
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,709
I'm dropping out

292
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:45,644
because I'm going to work
for Daoming Corp.

293
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:50,349
So dropping out doesn't mean
I'm giving up.

294
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,551
Instead, it's a new start.

295
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:55,020
However,

296
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:58,424
I won't be able to see you
in school anymore if you drop out.

297
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,194
As long as we know we're both doing well.

298
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,696
Even if we can't meet every day,

299
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,264
we can still think of each other.

300
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,233
But...

301
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:13,339
Hey.

302
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,207
Mimi.

303
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:17,843
Dinner tonight?

304
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,647
Gosh. I'm very busy now.
I don't have time for you.

305
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:22,548
Bye.

306
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:28,954
Qinghe, even though I'm not here,

307
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,389
you still have Mimi.

308
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,025
I can tell that she really likes you.

309
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,027
You have to be nice to her, okay?

310
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:38,364
Don't be like me.

311
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,000
I always rejected Daoming Si before.

312
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:43,335
It's all over now

313
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:46,071
and I just realized how much I love him.

314
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:49,742
I'll go ahead.

315
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:55,548
Shancai.

316
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:03,689
Qinghe, don't think it's natural
for someone to treat you nicely.

317
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:04,824
Treasure it.

318
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:08,093
You must treasure it.

319
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,207
Shancai.

320
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,409
You know what?

321
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,744
I've always treated you nicely.

322
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:31,844
Hello, miss.

323
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,112
I'd like to see your president.

324
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:34,713
Can you contact her for me?

325
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,151
-Good day, Ms. President.
-Good day, Ms. President.

326
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,588
Miss Shancai,
anything I can help you with?

327
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,124
I'd like to talk to your president.

328
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:48,327
Madam.

329
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:49,628
Miss Shancai...

330
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:52,831
I've decided to accept your chance
and work for Daoming Corp.

331
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:56,869
Shancai,

332
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,604
I know you won't disappoint me.

333
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:00,606
Very well.

334
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,175
Based on your experience,

335
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:05,511
I'll arrange for you to work
for the general affairs.

336
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:07,513
You can officially start tomorrow.

337
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,081
Any questions?

338
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:10,616
None.

339
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:11,917
Okay.

340
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:14,119
Go and report to the HR department now.

341
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,387
I've already informed them.

342
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:20,859
Shancai, welcome to our company.

343
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,162
I'll do my best.

344
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:38,711
I never thought Shancai would be willing
to work here.

345
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:41,413
Her fighting spirit
is unlike any other girls.

346
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:44,116
No matter how strong
her fighting spirit is

347
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:46,018
I only have one daughter-in-law.

348
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:47,319
And that is Yesha.

349
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:06,105
Qinghe.

350
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:13,379
Qinghe.

351
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:17,216
I'm happy that you visited me.

352
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:20,319
Didn't you ask me to come?

353
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:22,087
Yes.

354
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:23,856
Please come in.

355
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:42,441
Please have some drinks.

356
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:43,375
Thank you.

357
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:50,983
Qinghe,

358
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,951
you don't seem to be in a good mood.

359
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:54,787
Is it because my face...

360
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:56,755
Mimi,

361
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:59,024
Shancai dropped out of school.

362
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:03,162
My best friend left Yingde.

363
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,564
I'm so upset.

364
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,108
Qinghe,

365
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:18,177
I understand.

366
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,847
An outstanding person like Shancai
left Yingde.

367
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:24,516
It's not only your loss,

368
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,618
it's Yingde's loss too.

369
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:31,290
So Qinghe, please tell me,
how can I comfort you?

370
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:33,692
Mimi,

371
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,028
Shancai is right.

372
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,196
You're really a nice person.

373
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:43,502
Even if my face looks like this now,

374
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:45,237
do you still think I'm nice?

375
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:48,040
A person's appearance does not

376
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,875
represent who he really is inside.

377
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,112
Shancai always say

378
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:54,813
that we can't judge a person
by his appearance.

379
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,348
Do you know that?

380
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:00,486
Shancai really has so many good qualities
that I should learn from.

381
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:03,188
Of course.

382
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,525
Shancai has many good qualities.

383
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,194
She's tough.

384
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:10,229
She's kind.

385
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:13,365
And she has a bright smile.

386
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:17,236
I think I won't be able to find

387
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,638
another girl as good as Shancai
in this lifetime.

388
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:24,710
Qinghe.

389
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,046
Qinghe.

390
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:31,817
Qinghe,

391
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:35,954
if you meet a girl
who is at par with Shancai,

392
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:40,425
would you mind if her face
is full of pimples

393
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:43,228
and cucumbers?

394
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:46,565
Of course I won't.

395
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:50,068
Regardless of what Shancai has
on her face,

396
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,037
I won't mind.

397
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:03,582
Qinghe,

398
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:07,052
please date me with marriage in mind.

399
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:11,023
Daoming Si's the one getting married,
what does that have to do with me?

400
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:13,358
My dad said...

401
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:14,826
What else did your dad say?

402
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:19,331
If a man doesn't judge a woman
by her appearance,

403
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:23,168
that means he's a good man that focuses
on inner beauty and virtues.

404
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,871
Once such a good man gets married,

405
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:29,374
he'd definitely be faithful
and won't leave his wife,

406
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,043
even when she gets old.

407
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:34,813
My dad said that is the type of man
I can depend on.

408
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:38,483
Mimi...

409
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:39,885
You...

410
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,720
I think you've misunderstood.

411
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:45,891
I'm a shallow man who focus
on appearances the most.

412
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,129
Qinghe, stop being humble.

413
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:55,133
I went through a lot of trouble today
covering up my beautiful face,

414
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:59,004
just so I can put you to the final test.

415
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,240
Congratulations, Qinghe.

416
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:02,708
For what?

417
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:04,910
You've already passed
my three tough tests.

418
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,745
Three tests?

419
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:09,181
What tests did I exactly pass?

420
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:10,816
First,

421
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:12,651
<i>you drove me home before 10 p.m.</i>

422
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:14,086
<i>Second,</i>

423
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:15,520
<i>you didn't fall into temptation.</i>

424
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:16,989
<i>Third,</i>

425
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,857
<i>you didn't judge beauty
based on outward appearance.</i>

426
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:22,594
Qinghe, let's officially start dating now.

427
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:29,835
From now on,
can I call you "my dear Qinghe"?

428
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:33,372
Okay.

429
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:37,476
To be fair,

430
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:38,543
I have to test you too.

431
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,847
I'm willing to accept all your tests.

432
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:44,116
Great.

433
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:47,519
Starting today,

434
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,655
you must...

435
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,492
You must...

436
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,127
learn all of Shancai's good qualities.

437
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,562
It's a deal.

438
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,700
So, my dear Qinghe, please wait patiently.

439
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:03,335
I won't let you down.

440
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:19,484
<i>Lei, have you heard?</i>

441
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,320
<i>Shancai is going to work
in Ah Si's company.</i>

442
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:38,303
Why are you guys here?

443
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:51,983
What do you want us to do with you?

444
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,153
What?

445
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,360
A week ago, you stood on the loft

446
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:03,028
and told us you love that kind of life.

447
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,130
That you're a brand-new Ah Si.

448
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:07,666
Fine, we accepted that.

449
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:12,137
However, a week later,
you're back to being Daoming Si.

450
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,505
And you got engaged.

451
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:20,145
You didn't even inform us
about the engagement.

452
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,615
We had to see the news to find out.

453
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:26,218
All right... My bad.

454
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:28,587
That's because it happened too fast.

455
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:30,956
I'm not sure why my mom and Yesha
suddenly wanted me to have

456
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:32,791
an engagement press conference.

457
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:34,960
I didn't even have time to react.

458
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,495
-She already...
-That means...

459
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,898
the one who planned
this engagement conference

460
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,400
is Yesha.

461
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,511
Even though you didn't inform us
about your big day,

462
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:55,180
we still have to congratulate you.

463
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:58,483
There was no time,

464
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,419
I'm sorry.

465
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:02,087
Let me make a toast to you.

466
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:14,466
You've been back for a few days already.

467
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,834
Are you used to living here?

468
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:19,838
To be honest,

469
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:22,474
not really.

470
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:26,244
I wouldn't come back if my mom didn't

471
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,147
find Yesha.

472
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:32,050
However...

473
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:34,619
I'm so happy

474
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:37,456
to see Yesha again.

475
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:41,193
You're happy.

476
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,161
Your mother is also happy.

477
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:46,097
That princess should be happy, too.

478
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,467
Great.

479
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:51,069
This is awesome.

480
00:32:58,844 --> 00:32:59,678
But why did your mom

481
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:02,314
arrange a job for Shancai
at the Daoming Corp?

482
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:04,382
Isn't that good?

483
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,953
I don't think it's a good arrangement.

484
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:12,491
I thought since Shancai accepted
to work for us...

485
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:15,894
that maybe she's willing
to accept the new me.

486
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:20,031
I hope I can care about her
as a friend in the future.

487
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:22,267
Is it wrong

488
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:24,169
to think that way?

489
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,107
Actually, that's fine.

490
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,510
I believe you can be good friends again.

491
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:36,414
However, I need to remind you...

492
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,050
Never mind that you secretly got engaged,

493
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,886
just don't get married in secret too.

494
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,755
We've made a promise before.

495
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:45,190
No matter who gets married first,

496
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:47,125
the other three will definitely
be groomsmen.

497
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:48,693
Really?

498
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:51,930
I forgot all about it.

499
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:54,966
I must tell Yesha
this good news immediately.

500
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:58,737
Then treat this as your stag party.

501
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:00,438
That's right.

502
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:04,576
Let's make another toast
for Ah Si's farewell to singlehood.

503
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:06,177
-Thank you.
-Cheers.

504
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:07,078
Cheers.

505
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,013
Cheers.

506
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,812
Miss Yesha.

507
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,647
Madam wants to inform you

508
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:46,751
that Shancai will officially become
an employee of Daoming Corp. tomorrow.

509
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:58,930
What should I do, Sha?

510
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:10,141
Yesha,

511
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:11,543
it's me.

512
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,281
Yesha.

513
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:18,750
You're probably sleeping.

514
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:22,454
However, I still want

515
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:26,191
to tell you that I'm so happy today.

516
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:30,095
Good night.

517
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:52,150
No way.

518
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:55,053
We can't let Shancai work
in Daoming Corp. no matter what.

519
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:58,156
Meizuo, that's her decision.

520
00:35:58,223 --> 00:36:00,058
We don't have any right to change it.

521
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,627
We at least we have the right
to protect her and keep her safe.

522
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:06,564
What do you think, Lei?

523
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,767
I support Shancai.

524
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,178
Shancai, you can do it.

525
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,115
<i>Nice to meet you, Ms. Liu.</i>

526
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:54,079
Your name is Shancai?

527
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:55,246
Yes.

528
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:56,581
What kind of weird name is that?

529
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,820
We have loads of miscellaneous work
over at the General Affairs office.

530
00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:06,091
Can you remember instructions
by just standing there?

531
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:08,460
Yes.

532
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,564
This shipment urgently needs
price quotation.

533
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:13,531
Remember,

534
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:15,600
you need price quotations
from at least three companies.

535
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:16,534
Yes.

536
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:22,140
This is the warehouse inventory
information from 1999.

537
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:23,441
It needs to be updated.

538
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:28,279
Also, here's the minutes of the meeting

539
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:31,116
for the Mid-Autumn Festival employee gift
over the years.

540
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:33,818
Make a summary chart for reference.

541
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:35,353
-Yes.
-Mid-Autumn Festival is coming.

542
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,021
Don't delay everyone's benefit.

543
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:37,956
Understood.

544
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:41,593
This is a design
for the Autumn Festival uniform.

545
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:43,595
You need to do a price inquiry
and complete that today.

546
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:44,996
Yes.

547
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:48,666
This is the stationary distribution list
for each department this month.

548
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:49,567
It's urgent too.

549
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:54,205
This is the information required
for an important meeting tomorrow.

550
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:58,176
Make 30 copies before you leave today
and place them on my desk.

551
00:37:58,243 --> 00:37:59,077
Yes.

552
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,846
All right. That's your work for today.

553
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:02,781
That's all.

554
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:05,416
Yes.

555
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:15,426
Thank you, Ms. Liu.

556
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:34,679
Operations Department,
thank you for your hard work.

557
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:38,016
I'm really glad to introduce you today

558
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:40,919
to my only son, Daoming Si.

559
00:38:41,553 --> 00:38:44,556
And to my future daughter-in-law, Yesha.

560
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:51,763
Hello, everyone.

561
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:59,003
Daoming Si will soon become
the third successor of Daoming Corp.

562
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,506
In the future,

563
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:05,410
please support Ah Si
and his soon-to-be wife, Yesha,

564
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:09,113
the same support you've shown me.

565
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:40,545
Shancai.

566
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:49,020
Long time no see.

567
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:53,191
-I...
-I...

568
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:55,894
You go first.

569
00:39:58,296 --> 00:39:59,631
Do you know Sha is looking for you?

570
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:01,900
I know.

571
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:02,867
Thank you.

572
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:06,938
What did you want to say earlier?

573
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:08,673
I...

574
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:10,008
I forgot.

575
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:17,982
Shancai.

576
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,584
I remember what I want to say now.

577
00:40:19,651 --> 00:40:20,485
Follow me.

578
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:22,287
But, I...

579
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,155
Save that for later. Let's go.

580
00:40:33,665 --> 00:40:34,499
How nice.

581
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:36,034
We're eating mango dessert,

582
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,335
just like we used to do.

583
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:38,536
That's right.

584
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:39,837
Just like we used to do.

585
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:44,909
Shancai,

586
00:40:46,244 --> 00:40:48,646
I'm really happy you accepted this job.

587
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,381
You can do it.

588
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:53,117
This way, I can get my freedom back.

589
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:55,119
So...

590
00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:57,622
I'll share my courage to you.

591
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,325
With your courage and my courage together,

592
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:01,526
we can do anything.

593
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,130
Yesha,

594
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:07,231
we're good friends, right?

595
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,132
That's right.

596
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,100
So you won't lie to me.

597
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:10,234
Right?

598
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:12,236
That's right.

599
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,604
Then tell me,

600
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:16,774
why are you sacrificing your own freedom
for this scheme?

601
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:20,845
Did Daoming Feng threaten you
with some kind of condition?

602
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:22,880
No.

603
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:24,716
No, really.

604
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,351
I don't believe it.

605
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:27,385
This is not like you.

606
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:30,788
How come?

607
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:33,091
How come it's not like me?

608
00:41:36,394 --> 00:41:38,029
I'm naturally playful.

609
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:40,465
Adults, they play around with politics.

610
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:42,900
As for us children, we play our own games.

611
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:46,270
After I left Bhutan,

612
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,407
I've been playing hide-and-seek
with my Dad

613
00:41:49,474 --> 00:41:50,675
while traveling around the world.

614
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,678
I'm busted now.

615
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:56,881
So I can only wait for a good opportunity.

616
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,217
When the time comes, I'll sneak away.

617
00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:04,188
Before I leave, though,

618
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,725
I hope I can help get back
Ah Xing's memory.

619
00:42:09,761 --> 00:42:12,964
I want to see you two back together.

620
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,168
That's it.

621
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:21,072
But...

622
00:42:23,975 --> 00:42:24,842
Hey.

623
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,577
Yes.

624
00:42:27,245 --> 00:42:28,079
Manager.

625
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:30,081
I...

626
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:31,282
I'm with my friend.

627
00:42:32,517 --> 00:42:33,718
I'm sorry.

628
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:34,619
Okay.

629
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:36,554
Okay, I'll go back
and take care of it right away.

630
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:38,122
Yesha, I'm sorry.

631
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:40,058
My manager is looking for me.
I have to go.

632
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:43,027
It's my treat this time.

633
00:42:43,094 --> 00:42:44,195
Okay, it's on you today.

634
00:42:44,262 --> 00:42:45,129
I'll go ahead.

635
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,271
Shancai.

636
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:04,348
Let's have mango dessert again next time.

637
00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:08,386
The season of mangoes is almost over.
We can have strawberry dessert next time.

638
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,755
Okay. Let's eat strawberry dessert.

639
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:12,190
Bye.

640
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:13,324
Bye.

641
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:57,802
Daoming Si.

642
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:01,172
You need to make photocopies?
It's fine. You can go first.

643
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:03,107
It's fine. I'll come back later.

644
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:04,809
Shancai.

645
00:44:09,514 --> 00:44:12,416
I can't figure out
how to use this machine.

646
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:14,852
I'll help you.

647
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,220
Thank you.

648
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:20,992
Why didn't you ask your assistant
to do this for you?

649
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:23,895
It's okay, I'm free anyway.

650
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:26,931
How would you like to copy that?

651
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:30,268
I want to shrink it
so I can paste it on my notebook.

652
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,169
Okay.

653
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:33,437
I'll shrink it to 50 percent then.

654
00:44:36,107 --> 00:44:37,175
Like that.

655
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:38,442
Just press that button.

656
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:46,951
Will that do?

657
00:44:47,585 --> 00:44:48,553
Yes.

658
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:49,520
Thank you.

659
00:44:49,587 --> 00:44:50,521
You're welcome.

660
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:07,939
<i>Stupid Shancai.</i>

661
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:09,607
<i>Why are you shaking?</i>

662
00:45:09,674 --> 00:45:11,709
<i>Have you forgotten why you are here?</i>

663
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,044
Stupid.

664
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:14,845
Shancai.

665
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:17,081
Do you need anything else?

666
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:18,816
Nothing.

667
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:21,252
I just wanted to say...

668
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:23,187
welcome to our company.

669
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:24,956
Thank you.

670
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,561
<i>This is a good beginning.</i>

671
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:31,963
<i>That's right.</i>

672
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:35,199
<i>As long as I don't give up,
every day will be a good beginning.</i>

673
00:47:13,798 --> 00:47:15,766
