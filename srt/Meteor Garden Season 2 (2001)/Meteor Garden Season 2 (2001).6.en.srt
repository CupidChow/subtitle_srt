1
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:43,864
Did you get enough sleep?

2
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:49,469
Did you stay up all night?

3
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,372
How could I sleep in this shitty place?

4
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:57,344
There was a pig that used my thighs
as pillows all night.

5
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,414
I couldn't move a muscle.

6
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:03,383
I couldn't even kill mosquitoes.

7
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,786
Why didn't you tell me?

8
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,320
Nonsense.

9
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:09,089
How could I?

10
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,491
I was scared of waking you up.

11
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:23,437
Stop complaining.

12
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,540
At least we're still alive.

13
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,377
Now you know it's dangerous, huh?

14
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:32,846
What do you mean?

15
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,551
First, there was the thief.

16
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,886
Then, there was the kidnapper.

17
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,389
Why do you like picking fights?

18
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:46,259
Do you like it when I worry about you?

19
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,834
Don't "huh" me.

20
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,436
You are a silly, lazy girl, and a pig too.

21
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:57,904
Are you a pig?

22
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,241
This is my final warning.

23
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,577
Don't treat yourself like garbage.

24
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:06,246
Don't risk your life
just to fight bad guys.

25
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,714
Don't...

26
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:13,353
Don't... Anyway, don't...
Just don't do it.

27
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:19,559
Quit laughing.

28
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,696
I'm so happy.

29
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,398
You never talked this much before,
now you're scolding me.

30
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,134
You're making rapid progress here.

31
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,294
Aren't you hungry?

32
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:55,695
I'm so hungry.

33
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:56,863
Why are you copying me?

34
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,799
You copied me first.

35
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:03,470
Do you have money?

36
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,375
-No.
-I do.

37
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,843
-How much?
-Twelve bucks.

38
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,478
What can twelves bucks...

39
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:24,858
Let's split it in half.

40
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:43,710
It's so delicious.

41
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:55,388
I didn't know you can buy such a delicacy
with twelves bucks.

42
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,258
You eat too fast.

43
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,740
Do you have another twelve bucks?

44
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,709
Try looking for more.

45
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:32,292
How?

46
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,427
How, what?

47
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,830
How will we manage?

48
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,932
We can't stay here forever.

49
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:43,937
We will search for an apartment.

50
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:47,707
We can't handle another Zhongze.

51
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,510
We got robbed.

52
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,212
Then, you did some advertising.

53
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:54,881
We don't have money to rent an apartment.

54
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:01,521
I'll call my aunt with my last two bucks.

55
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,459
All right.

56
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:09,095
-Let's look for a telephone.
-Okay.

57
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:17,170
<i>If I were you, I would be too scared
to live there, too.</i>

58
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:19,339
<i>Also, the house is pretty full.</i>

59
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:22,275
<i>We honestly couldn't accommodate you two.</i>

60
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,477
<i>There is an old lady nearby.</i>

61
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,313
<i>I heard her tenant just moved away.</i>

62
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,481
<i>She is a nice person, too.</i>

63
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,551
<i>Maybe you could even discuss
the rent with her.</i>

64
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:32,986
Really?

65
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,187
Okay, thank you.

66
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,125
She said there is an old lady
that has a place for rent.

67
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,427
It's up ahead. Let's check it out?

68
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,295
-Is this the address? Okay.
-Yes.

69
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:55,475
-Hi, Granny.
-Granny.

70
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:56,443
Who are you looking for?

71
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,378
A woman named Mrs. Xu told us
to rent your apartment.

72
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:01,314
Yes. She told us that...

73
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,084
No.

74
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,354
We just came back from overseas.
We really need a place to live, granny.

75
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,756
You, youngsters, have no discipline.

76
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,758
I've had enough. The answer is no.

77
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,027
You don't have to be so rude.

78
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,528
It's not illegal for being young.

79
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:18,064
-Let it go.
-What are you afraid of?

80
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,966
She said youngsters have no discipline.

81
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,402
How about herself?
She's being rude at such an old age.

82
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:23,837
I said the truth.

83
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:25,739
You two.

84
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,041
What's your relationship?

85
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,509
-Friends.
-Siblings.

86
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,411
What's your budget?

87
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:32,712
-None.
-It depends.

88
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,214
You have no money.

89
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,317
No discipline. Lying.

90
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:38,952
No.

91
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:40,954
Hey!

92
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:56,469
Hey, what are you doing?

93
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,174
Are you addicted to tying shoelaces?

94
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:36,443
No.

95
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,545
I think, at her age,

96
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,480
maybe she just wants to be strong.

97
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,183
Actually, I regret being mean to her.

98
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,885
Five thousand a month.
Three months' rent as the deposit.

99
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:49,022
Pay the rent immediately
when you earn money.

100
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,990
No pets allowed.

101
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,392
No strangers allowed.

102
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:55,762
Don't put used dishes, cups,
and chopsticks in the sink.

103
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:58,565
Keep quiet between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m.

104
00:09:58,631 --> 00:09:59,632
There's more thing.

105
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,634
Don't call me "granny."

106
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,537
Break one rule and you'll be evicted.

107
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:05,738
Got it.

108
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,541
-Thanks, granny!
-Thanks, granny!

109
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:13,179
Yeah!

110
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:25,592
Be my guest.

111
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,733
-Is this the place?
-What's wrong?

112
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,238
Nothing...

113
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,140
That furniture...

114
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,642
Don't you like it?
Do you want to throw it away?

115
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,913
No. Granny, has anyone lived here before?

116
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,815
What are you trying to say?

117
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:50,850
Don't you want to live here?

118
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,018
No.

119
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,688
Okay, I'll leave you to it.

120
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:13,106
It's so beautiful.

121
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,230
What should we do next?

122
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,035
We pray for God's blessing.

123
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:48,041
Let's go.

124
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:15,068
<i>It's been a week
since we came back to Taiwan.</i>

125
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,570
<i>I don't cry for no reason anymore.</i>

126
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,740
<i>However, I still don't want to stay home,</i>

127
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,844
<i>because I don't want to make my parents
worry about me anymore.</i>

128
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,535
<i>No matter where I go,</i>

129
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,537
<i>I'm still trapped by myself,</i>

130
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:55,008
<i>and... Daoming Si.</i>

131
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,829
<i>Daoming Si, I won't give up.</i>

132
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,332
<i>I know you're on your way home,</i>

133
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,334
<i>so I'll be waiting for you.</i>

134
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,069
<i>Waiting for you to find yourself.</i>

135
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,741
I KNOW YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY HOME

136
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:32,698
I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU... FOREVER.

137
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:37,937
DAOMING SI

138
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,959
Still a lot of stuff over there.

139
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,863
I'm exhausted from moving this one.

140
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,466
There's nothing in that place.

141
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:10,937
Also, there really are tons of...

142
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:46,572
THE BEST PRESENTS FOR TEACHERS
FRESH COFFEE WITH SNACKS

143
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:05,892
Hello, I'd like to know the price
for one ad on your electronic billboard?

144
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,262
Oh, it's on an hourly basis.

145
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,497
Could you please tell me the price
for one minute?

146
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:14,333
That's so high.

147
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,078
Hey! What are you doing?

148
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:01,514
-What?
-What? Throw it away.

149
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,915
How can you throw it away?

150
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:05,117
-Don't mess with my stuff.
-I take that...

151
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,967
I'm exhausted. I'm too tired.

152
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:23,269
I'm so thirsty.

153
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,505
Hey!

154
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:32,378

I can do this.

159
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:06,412
One more!

160
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,748
You'll get drunk.

161
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:09,882
No way.

162
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:11,784
I won't carry you home if you pass out.

163
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:13,085
No problem.

164
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:17,490

00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,811
We got the prize...

172
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,913
What?

173
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:43,916
Drink.

174
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,527
I can do this. Come on.

175
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,263

-Drink!

184
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:30,529
More.

185
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,133
-Can you do this?
-Yes.

186
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,136
-Let's do this.
-Cool.

187
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:40,840
-Drink!
-Drink!

188
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,744
-Drink!
-Drink!

189
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:48,714
-Drink!
-Drink!

190
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:53,052
-Drink!
-Drink!

191
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,690
-Drink!
-Drink!

192
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:02,361
-Drink!
-Drink!

193
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,782
You...

194
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:30,122
I win!

195
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:34,693
Prize...

196
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,364
Prize...

197
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,372
Drink!

198
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:47,506
More.

199
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,908
I'm not afraid of you.

200
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:51,677
Yes, I can.

201
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:09,061
"More" my ass.

202
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:11,530
You're so drunk.

203
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:12,798
I can.

204
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,267
I can.

205
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:21,473
More.

206
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:29,949
More.

207
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:32,184
"More" my ass.

208
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,386
You...

209
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:03,249
Drank too much.

210
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,651
Don't go. Let's drink some more.

211
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,053
"Drink" my ass.

212
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,222
-Drink some more...
-Come on...

213
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:39,919
It's finished.

214
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:41,220
We win.

215
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,163
Did you get the prize?

216
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:54,099
Hey, you're still sober.

217
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,469
You lied about your alcohol tolerance.

218
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,072
Also, you got yourself so drunk.

219
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:01,740
-I'm so mad now.
-I'm not drunk.

220
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:03,475
You lied to me, too.

221
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:06,745
What did I lie to you about?

222
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,348
You told me you won't carry me back.

223
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,651
Your back is really wide.

224
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,687
It's so comfortable.

225
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:16,388
You...

226
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,314
Drink...

227
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:44,350
"Drink" my ass...

228
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,051
More.

229
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:05,004
Shancai.

230
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,039
What are you thinking?

231
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:08,440
You got things so complicated.

232
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,675
I'm thinking...

233
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,312
There's one thing
I want to discuss with you.

234
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:15,681
Why don't you change your mind?
It's very weird.

235
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:16,815
What are they fighting about?

236
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:18,417
Who's fighting with him?

237
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:25,157
We were thinking of ways to find Si.

238
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,292
Meizuo came up with 800 ideas,

239
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,762
which are all extremely high-profile.

240
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:32,064
There are 801 ideas.

241
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:35,000
The four of us can hang
around the streets.

242
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:36,635
Maybe we will find Ah Si.

243
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:38,971
-Thank you.
-No problem.

244
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:42,341
If you can, you can think of an idea.

245
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:44,076
A low-profile one.

246
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:48,914
Excuse me.

247
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,382
I'm a little confused.

248
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:52,351
Why can't we do it high-profile?

249
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:54,853
Because they're stupid ideas.

250
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:57,189
So yours are not stupid?

251
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:02,428
All right, stop fighting
and just pretend I didn't ask anything.

252
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:06,265
Shancai.

253
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:10,402
I think there are more people I offended
besides Zhongze.

254
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,541
You're not the only one.

255
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:18,977
Too many people have grudges
against us, F4.

256
00:26:22,548 --> 00:26:24,349
Ah Si isn't just any guy.

257
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,853
He is the heir to the Daoming family.

258
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:32,157
We can't take the risk no matter what.

259
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,469
Don't you have something to tell us?

260
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:48,740
I forgot.

261
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:19,738
This little...

262
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:22,341
Right...

263
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:24,843
I stopped working before going to Spain.

264
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:26,678
When I came back...

265
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:31,416
But if I can be more careful...

266
00:27:35,721 --> 00:27:37,189
Where's the calculator?

267
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,494
Deduct living expenses...

268
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,897
Insurance...

269
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:47,399
Water bills...

270
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,169
Electricity and gas bills...

271
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:55,440
Interest, debt, and red envelope...

272
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,708
Red envelope for what?

273
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:00,212
Li from our sales department
will get married next week.

274
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,813
Why is he getting married now?

275
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,583
I hate these kinds of people.
Kicking a man who is down.

276
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:06,151
Six hundred is enough.

277
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,452
Six hundred?

278
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,588
That is embarrassing for us.

279
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:12,958
We can't pay Shancai's tuition
and you're thinking about embarrassment?

280
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:16,728
That's far from enough!

281
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:19,898
Be quiet, okay?

282
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:21,433
Shancai hasn't gone to bed yet.

283
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:28,240
Don't think I don't know
that Shancai is suffering from insomnia.

284
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:30,776
It's hard for her to fall asleep
these days.

285
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:35,080
We've done so much
to get Shancai accepted by Yingde.

286
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:40,085
I thought she hit the jackpot
when she met Master Si.

287
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:44,423
I didn't know
it would lead to so many troubles.

288
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:49,962
Our once energetic daughter is sad now.

289
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,563
So sad...

290
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:56,101
Honey, don't get upset.

291
00:28:56,535 --> 00:29:00,472
We promised that we need to stay strong
for Shancai.

292
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,741
Strong?

293
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,076
Okay.

294
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:09,982
Then let's see how much money
we can save, okay?

295
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:10,983
Okay.

296
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,751
How about this?

297
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:16,088
Starting tomorrow,
we will stick with vegetables.

298
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:18,257
We're overweight anyway.

299
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,530
You...

300
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:29,167
No need to cry
if you don't want to be a vegetarian.

301
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:32,170
It's not about being a vegetarian.

302
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:35,274
-What is it about?
-I think I'm useless.

303
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:38,343
As my kid's dad,

304
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,680
I can't pay the tuition
and the classes are about to start.

305
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:44,049
I'm so useless.

306
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:46,318
There, there. Don't blame yourself.

307
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:48,253
It's all right, don't cry.

308
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,488
It's all right, don't cry.

309
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:50,956
It's all right, don't cry.

310
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:53,759
It's all right, don't cry.

311
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:00,966
See you, ma'am.

312
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,068
Shancai, wait a minute.

313
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:05,170
There's one cake left.

314
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:06,471
You can take it home.

315
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:11,576
<i>You're so bad.</i>

316
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:14,579
<i>This way, I'll owe you one strawberry.</i>

317
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:17,182
<i>Then, remember to pay me back.</i>

318
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,051
<i>Don't worry.</i>

319
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:20,652
<i>I'll use my whole life to pay you back.</i>

320
00:30:23,722 --> 00:30:26,224
No, my next workplace
provides staff meals.

321
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,026
Are you working on another job?

322
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:29,194
Yes.

323
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:31,196
Why are you exhausting yourself?

324
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:33,065
I'm not. How am I exhausting myself
if I'm paid?

325
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,433
I should go.

326
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,916
Ximen, you're finally here.

327
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:53,218
This is the red wine
I talked about before.

328
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:54,186
Try it.

329
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:57,189
If you like it,
you can call my friend to order more.

330
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,857
It's recommended by Ximen.

331
00:30:59,091 --> 00:31:00,359
I have faith in it.

332
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:03,562
Hey, what's the matter?

333
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:04,763
Have a drink with me first.

334
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,864
No.

335
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:07,265
You haven't been here recently.

336
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,735
I'm annoyed to death by your girls.

337
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,070
Also, there is a wine event tonight.

338
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,106
These girls are hot.

339
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:16,007
See? There she is.

340
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:20,579
Maybe another day.

341
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:22,781
Come back later.

342
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:26,852
What's wrong?

343
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:28,420
I really can't do this.

344
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:33,458
If I have to dress like this,
I would rather kill myself.

345
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:35,961
Well, it's for the money.

346
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:39,765
You're right.

347
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:50,942
Sir, excuse me.

348
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,011
This is our new fruit wine.

349
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,881
It has three flavors including strawberry,
orange, and Hami melon.

350
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:57,949
Now we're promoting it.

351
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,851
Buy three, and you'll get one free.

352
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,054
Buy five,
you can play our fruit fist game.

353
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:04,990
If you win, you get another one free.

354
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,191
Would you like to give it a try?

355
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,059
-What's fruit fist?
-Let me teach you.

356
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:10,362
-Who will I play with?
-With me.

357
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:12,431
Come on. Please stand here.

358
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:14,733
One, two, three, four, hey.

359
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,201
-Orange, orange.
-Strawberry, strawberry.

360
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:17,669
-Hami melon, Hami melon.
-Orange, orange.

361
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:19,137
-Strawberry, strawberry.
-Orange, orange.

362
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:20,605
-Hami melon, Hami melon.
-Orange, orange.

363
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:22,374
-Strawberry, strawberry.
-Strawberry, strawberry.

364
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,009
-You win! Amazing.
-You lose...

365
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,311
Sir, can you please tell me
what fruit is in my back?

366
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:27,813
Grapes.

367
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:30,081
Congratulations! You get one bottle
of classic grape wine.

368
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:31,683
Wow! Amazing...

369
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,085
One, two, three, four, hey.

370
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:35,854
-Hami melon, hami melon.
-Strawberry, strawberry.

371
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:36,988
Orange, orange.

372
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:38,757
-Strawberry, strawberry.
-Hami melon, Hami melon.

373
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:40,525
-Hami melon, Hami melon.
-Strawberry, strawberry.

374
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:42,194
-Orange... Wow! You win.
-Orange...

375
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,528
Amazing! One more.

376
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:45,831
One, two, three, four, hey.

377
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:46,998
Strawberry, strawberry.

378
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:48,467
-Hami melon, Hami melon.
-Orange, orange.

379
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,235
-Hami melon, Hami melon.
-Strawberry, strawberry.

380
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:51,436
-Orange, orange.
-Orange, orange.

381
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:52,904
-Orange, orange.
-Hami melon, Hami melon.

382
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,673
-Hami melon, Hami melon.
-Hami melon, Hami melon.

383
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,477
-I won't go.
-Me, neither.

384
00:32:58,643 --> 00:32:59,611
Go where?

385
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:02,013
The group leader said that
besides the in-nightclub work,

386
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,483
we will invite people to taste it
on the street.

387
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:06,084
Who dares to go out dressing like this?

388
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:08,954
Yeah. If my friends see me,
they'll laugh their asses off.

389
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:10,956
There are 801 ideas.

390
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:14,059
The four of us
can hang around the streets.

391
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,694
Maybe we'll find Ah Si.

392
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:17,362
I'll go.

393
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,598
Don't you think the costume is ugly?

394
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,899
The uglier, the better.

395
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:22,734
It's more eye-catching this way.

396
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:27,038
No.

397
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,674
Hold it.

398
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:30,942
Be careful...

399
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:31,977
You be careful.

400
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:32,944
That side.

401
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,947
Is it stable back there?

402
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:38,049
Wait a second...

403
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:39,784
-Don't mess with it.
-I'm putting some padding.

404
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,520
-Otherwise, it will be unstable.
-It's unstable.

405
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,221
Why are you copying me?

406
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:45,490
This side.

407
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:46,458
A little bit left.

408
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,394
-Let go...
-Wait a second...

409
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:51,663
-Let go.
-Wait a second.

410
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:55,867
-That's it.
-See...

411
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:58,336
-You are messing with it.
-You are stupid.

412
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:00,672
Granny.

413
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:02,440
Granny.

414
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:03,909
Granny.

415
00:34:08,113 --> 00:34:09,114
Granny.

416
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:14,519
We will find a way
to pay you as soon as possible.

417
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:29,200
You need to keep some cash on you.

418
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:30,735
Thank you, Granny.

419
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:46,918
How much? A thousand bucks.

420
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:49,387
We're rich!

421
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:50,822
What are you doing up there?

422
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,026
Are you tearing down my house?

423
00:34:58,897 --> 00:34:59,998
A thousand bucks.

424
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,200
-Let's go eat...
-Let's buy instant noodles.

425
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:03,401
Okay.

426
00:35:31,997 --> 00:35:34,799
COCONUT
ON SALE!

427
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:38,229
Delicious.

428
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:07,759
Awesome, right? This is yours.

429
00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:08,927
Or do you want the bigger one?

430
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:10,762
This one is fine.

431
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:11,963
Okay.

432
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:14,199
Delicious.

433
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:15,333
I know, right?

434
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:24,075
They're ready to eat.

435
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,376
It smells so good.

436
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,412
Isn't it too hot?

437
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,759
Mine is bigger than yours.

438
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,031
Aren't you gonna drink it?

439
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:50,335
...Three!

440
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:58,042
I...

441
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:07,852
Ah Xing.

442
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,190
Don't throw it away. Bring it here.

443
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,060
-The coconut?
-Yes, bring it here.

444
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,028
Come on.

445
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:47,792
-Go ahead.
-You take it.

446
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:48,993
You go ahead.

447
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,128
-You take it.
-You take it.

448
00:38:58,503 --> 00:38:59,637
It's so cute.

449
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,976
-A little bit up.
-Oh, which one?

450
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:06,411
Yeah...

451
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,143
Be careful.

452
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:40,879
You two.

453
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,380
Do you know how late it is?

454
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:45,817
I told you to be quiet after 10 p.m.

455
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:47,652
So you don't want to live here, right?

456
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,984
<i>Shancai, where are you?</i>

457
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:54,752
<i>Why don't you pick up the phone?</i>

458
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:57,855
<i>Your dad made you twice-cooked pork.</i>

459
00:40:58,356 --> 00:40:59,691
<i>Don't eat it.</i>

460
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:01,459
<i>Do you forget you're a vegetarian now?</i>

461
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:03,561
<i>We are at VS. Would you come and join us?</i>

462
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,663
<i>Be quick. Meizuo and Lei are here now.</i>

463
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,198
<i>Leave your things and join us.</i>

464
00:41:07,265 --> 00:41:09,767
<i>We're gonna tell you
a funny joke we heard.</i>

465
00:41:10,335 --> 00:41:14,739
<i>I've put the twice-cooked pork
in the cabinet in your room.</i>

466
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:17,275
<i>Don't forget to eat it when you're home.</i>

467
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,243
<i>Shancai, you're not at the cake store.</i>

468
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,478
<i>Then you...</i>

469
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,823
FROM HUAZE LEI
IS THE SNAIL STANDING UPSIDE DOWN?

470
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,158
OR HIDING IN THE SHELL?
DOING?

471
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:25,743
-Ah Xing.
-What?

472
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:26,811
I got a stomachache. Quick.

473
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:28,513
I'm in the bathroom.

474
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:29,514
Quick.

475
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,315
Okay, okay, okay.

476
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,185
Quick.

477
00:42:34,452 --> 00:42:36,320
Wow, your stomach really hurts.

478
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:38,089
Okay, I'm done...

479
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:40,491
Quick!

480
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:43,061
Okay, why are you in such a hurry?

481
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:45,163
It hurts. Don't block my way.

482
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,134
Weird.

483
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:52,470
How could the stomach hurt so much?

484
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:59,911
Yesha...

485
00:43:00,278 --> 00:43:02,914
Be quick. It hurts again.

486
00:43:03,014 --> 00:43:05,583
Yesha...

487
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,285
Quick... I...

488
00:43:10,655 --> 00:43:12,090
Why are you making a fuss in the morning?

489
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:14,025
Why are you shouting so loud?

490
00:43:18,663 --> 00:43:19,997
Be quiet, will you?

491
00:43:25,036 --> 00:43:26,037
It hurts again.

492
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,840
-Let me go first.
-Me first.

493
00:43:29,307 --> 00:43:31,776
Wait, you've finished and my stomach...

494
00:43:32,243 --> 00:43:33,644
-You...
-You...

495
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:35,513
-Don't do this to me.
-You can go outside.

496
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,281
You wait for me. I'll be quick, okay?

497
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:39,517
-You go--
-I'll be--

498
00:43:47,325 --> 00:43:48,726
This is for diarrhea.

499
00:43:50,862 --> 00:43:52,630
Ate cold and hot food at the same time.

500
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,132
Drank tons of coconut juice.

501
00:43:54,232 --> 00:43:55,666
No wonder you got diarrhea.

502
00:43:57,235 --> 00:44:00,238
Clean the toilet before noon.

503
00:44:00,905 --> 00:44:02,306
It stinks.

504
00:44:06,077 --> 00:44:07,912
You're the one to blame.

505
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,214
You're the culprit.

506
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:11,516
You got me scolded by granny.

507
00:44:11,716 --> 00:44:12,817
Shitballs.

508
00:44:14,352 --> 00:44:15,486
What did you call them?

509
00:44:16,287 --> 00:44:17,488
Shitballs.

510
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:19,257
We got diarrhea.

511
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,424
Of course, they are shitballs.

512
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:22,960
-Yeah.
-And you're laughing...

513
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:24,695
-No shame.
-Shitballs.

514
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:25,830
Stand there.

515
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:27,832
Think about what you did wrong.

516
00:44:28,266 --> 00:44:29,901
Don't stand at ease. Attention.

517
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,540
This is...

518
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:38,176
-Let me try it.
-Okay.

519
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:39,911
Give me another one.

520
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:41,345
What is this?

521
00:46:15,673 --> 00:46:17,675
