1
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:13,934
Our manager wants you to send these
to the shipping department.

2
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:14,901
Oh, thank you.

3
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,116
Hello.

4
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,519
Ximen is in the hospital?

5
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,123
All right. Got it.

6
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:37,324
Okay, thank you.

7
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:44,364
Daoming Si.

8
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,233
-Ximen--
-Ximen is in the hospital.

9
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:32,145
<i>The five of them turned back
into what they were before.</i>

10
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:33,680
<i>Great.</i>

11
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:39,853
Come on.

12
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:43,757
I brought you video games.

13
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,861
Put it away.

14
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,131
And VCD.

15
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,234
You throw things at me
after I just had a surgery?

16
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:55,602
All right, there's more.

17
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,308
You can watch whatever you want.

18
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:03,477
I'll set it up for you later.

19
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:04,611
How do you like it?

20
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:06,346
Is there anything else you need?

21
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,516
I'm going to leave the hospital very soon.

22
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,019
You weakling. Staying here
for a few days won't kill you.

23
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,223
Lei and I will visit you every day.

24
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:18,759
Right, Lei?

25
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:23,930
I'm fine with it.

26
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:26,967
But I have a condition.

27
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:28,935
What is it?

28
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,840
I'll lie in your bed.

29
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:40,180
Ximen has such a huge bed.
You two can lie together.

30
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:42,349
Hi, Meizuo.

31
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:43,550
Hey, Shancai.

32
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:44,484
Ximen.

33
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:46,686
Why did you just tell us now
that you're in the hospital?

34
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,121
Are you okay?

35
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,056
I became okay the moment I saw you.

36
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:53,927
Take a seat.

37
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,463
Are you okay?

38
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,366
Why do you have such dark circles
under your eyes?

39
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,067
I do?

40
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,569
Yeah.

41
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,870
You can let Ah Si tell you.

42
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:05,539
Really?

43
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:08,308
Thanks.

44
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:13,880
Oh, my gosh.

45
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,982
It's pretty serious.

46
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:19,419
But at least I don't have
gastric perforation.

47
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,387
Ximen.

48
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:22,689
She's being sarcastic.

49
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,258
That's our Shancai.

50
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,526
She thrives in hardship.

51
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:29,930
I think the Empress Dowager brought out
your weed spirit.

52
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,433
Who's the Empress Dowager?

53
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,670
The Empress Dowager is your mother,
Mrs. Daoming.

54
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:42,042
That is the right word for her.

55
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,053
Hello.

56
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,661
Do I have to go?

57
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,369
Okay.

58
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:12,973
What's the matter?

59
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,075
My mom...

60
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,947
It's nothing.

61
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,417
How could you say it's nothing
with your long face?

62
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:25,719
Yeah.

63
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,287
You look upset.

64
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:28,622
Are you going to have a blind date?

65
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,094
Am I right?

66
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,596
No way, Meizuo.

67
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,202
Why are you laughing at me?
It's already a bad day for me, okay?

68
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:46,506
Go ahead.

69
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,575
Go see your perfect wife
that your mom has picked for you.

70
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:49,609
What does she look like?

71
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,478
What do you think she looks like?

72
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:55,215
A big butt that will have my baby.

73
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,019
Always having that auspicious look
on her face.

74
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:07,394
Stop laughing.

75
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,029
It hurts.

76
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,970
Don't let me catch you having a surgery.
I tell you that.

77
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:21,094
She's Ying Xiaociao, the daughter
of the president of Jundi Construction.

78
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:22,429
She just graduated from the US.

79
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,198
Another precious pretty face
with no brain.

80
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,878
You've turned into a young adult
after all these years.

81
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,247
This is Mrs. Ying.

82
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:42,916
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

83
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,784
Nice to meet you.

84
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:49,656
Xiaociao just received her master degree
in music in the US.

85
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,058
She can play cello very well.

86
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,527
I heard her performance just now.

87
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,297
Thank you, everyone.

88
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:02,869
I'd like to know if there's any song
you want to listen to?

89
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,471
I'll perform it for you.

90
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,441
Meizuo, what do you want to listen to?

91
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:10,944
I'll have Xiaociao play it for you.

92
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:17,484
The world's famous, "Doraemon."

93
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,787
I'm sorry, I don't know this song.

94
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:21,888
No?

95
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:24,257
Such a classic.

96
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:30,964
Never mind, that's okay.

97
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:34,267
Just play whatever you like.

98
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:47,847
Not bad, right?

99
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,738
What's wrong with finding one
with the same social status?

100
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,073
What's good about it?

101
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,677
Besides having the same social status,
what's wrong about it?

102
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,112
Her education, her family.

103
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,980
She's beautiful and elegant.

104
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:23,049
I think she is perfect.

105
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,419
The harder you push me,
the worse I think she is.

106
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:29,222
I tell you what, I'm not pushing you.

107
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,492
What I mean is
you can be normal friends at first.

108
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,929
You keep changing your girlfriends.

109
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:38,331
You can treat her like a normal friend.

110
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:41,167
If you think she's good, good.

111
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,736
If not, I have a long list in my hands.

112
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:44,871
You can pick from it.

113
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:47,640
How is that?

114
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:51,311
Do you want to date her,
or you want me to find you another one?

115
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,915
Fine, I'll do it.

116
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:58,885
I'll ask her out on a date
when I'm free, okay?

117
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,522
Okay. I have planned it out for you.

118
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:04,891
You'll pick Xiaociao up at her place
at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow, okay?

119
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:05,959
How could you?

120
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,026
I won't do that.

121
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:10,930
Fine. Then I will arrange a date for you
with the daughter from the Fuguo Hotel.

122
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,099
Mom.

123
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:15,935
Are you going or not?

124
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:18,338
I'll go.

125
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:20,740
That's my boy.

126
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,828
Hello, I'm Ah...

127
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,730
I'm Daoming Si.

128
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:46,532
Mom.

129
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,403
No, Ximen is sick.
I just visited him in the hospital.

130
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,374
Shancai is his friend.
Why can't she be there?

131
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,012
Okay.

132
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:01,080
I know.

133
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,931
Master Daoming Si.
Why are you here in person?

134
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,367
If there's anything you want,
you can just call--

135
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:55,368
I'm looking for Shancai.

136
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:56,836
Got it.

137
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,205
Shancai, come here.

138
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:04,544
What's the matter?

139
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:07,513
I'll leave you to it.

140
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,049
-I heard your dad sells cars?
-That's right.

141
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:11,551
Could you do me a favor?

142
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,052
Order a van for me.

143
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:15,655
I want it to be exactly the same
as this design.

144
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,290
It's so cute.

145
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,458
Yesha designed this.

146
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,592
Yesha designed this?

147
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,427
How is she so talented?

148
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:23,763
Remember, the same as this van.

149
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,897
I'll try my best.

150
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,300
Great, thank you.
I knew you would help me.

151
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,868
-No problem.
-I have to go now.

152
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:47,887
<i>No wonder Daoming Si loves Yesha so much.</i>

153
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:51,290
<i>She is pretty, smart, and talented.</i>

154
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,693
<i>What do I have to compete with Yesha?</i>

155
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,133
He's gone now. What are you staring at?

156
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,167
I'm sorry, ma'am.

157
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,300
Did I wake you up?

158
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,210
How do you feel? Are you hungry?

159
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,780
Do you need some warm milk?

160
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,983
You can go rest.

161
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,822
That's okay. I'm fine.

162
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,868
What's the matter? Can't fall asleep?

163
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,204
I slept too much in the day.

164
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:26,385
This book is pretty good.

165
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:30,223
I just started it.

166
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,976
"Maybe as I get older,

167
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:52,979
I become more mature.

168
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:59,385
I'm done saying what I have to say.

169
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:08,327
People don't have the desire
to listen to me anymore.

170
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:14,267
Maybe I'm bored with this shady world.

171
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:19,405
People keep questioning my stories.

172
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,610
It's just like when I was in biology class
in high school.

173
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,850
I was fiddling with
and poking that anesthetized frog.

174
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,519
I was observing the origin of life.

175
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:39,825
In the end,

176
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:46,499
that poor little thing was killed."

177
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,481
In 25 years,

178
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:09,789
it seems that I've never read to you.

179
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,893
We've never had a talk,

180
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,395
because you never come home.

181
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,234
It's not like I didn't want to.

182
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,638
I have a home that I can't go back to.

183
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:27,573
Because Mom...

184
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,079
I've only loved one woman in my life.

185
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,584
But she's never loved me
even for a minute.

186
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:45,491
The first time I saw your mother,

187
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,494
I told myself,

188
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:57,603
"I would get her no matter what it takes."

189
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:03,809
Her fiancée worked for your grandfather.

190
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:11,784
It couldn't be easier to break them up.

191
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:14,387
I was thinking

192
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,090
that it was so easy

193
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,459
to win a woman's heart.

194
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:24,764
But I was wrong.

195
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,268
I've been doing this business for decades.

196
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,105
I think ahead of others.

197
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,642
I defeated so many enemies.

198
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,179
I survived so many crises.

199
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,117
But I can't survive this one.

200
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,224
I can't defeat this man.

201
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:54,360
Because...

202
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,065
he's hiding inside your mother's heart.

203
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,471
He's untouchable.

204
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:10,976
Finally, I understand.

205
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,748
I'll never have the chance

206
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:21,253
to defeat this man.

207
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,896
Dad.

208
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,166
Could you please
finish reading that article?

209
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:49,181
"No matter what the reason is,

210
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:53,185
I find there are fewer and fewer people

211
00:20:56,889 --> 00:21:01,894
telling the story of Christmas box
at Christmas."

212
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:04,196
<i>Ximen told me</i>

213
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,099
that the Empress Dowager brings out
Shancai's weed spirit.

214
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,567
Do you know who is the Empress Dowager?

215
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,170
The Empress Dowager is my mom.

216
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:13,539
It's funny, right?

217
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:17,176
It's so funny.

218
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:22,414
<i>Right. I gave your design to Shancai.</i>

219
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,983
<i>She said she will help.</i>

220
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:27,019
<i>She kept saying that you're so talented.</i>

221
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:31,791
<i>Of course, I said
that my Yesha is the best.</i>

222
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:33,993
<i>Yesha.</i>

223
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,528
<i>You have to paint more.</i>

224
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,630
<i>And you have to paint really hard.</i>

225
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,266
<i>I'll arrange an art show for you.</i>

226
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:42,935
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

227
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:44,770
Yesha.

228
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:47,473
Yesha.

229
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:55,114
Yesha.

230
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:01,687
She must have fallen asleep.

231
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,322
You lazy pig.

232
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,133
I'll pick you up at eight.

233
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,100
Get off the car.

234
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,209
Eight might be too early.

235
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:46,812
Aristocratic girls like you

236
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:48,847
are good at shopping.

237
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,050
I'll come here at ten.

238
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:52,985
See you at ten.

239
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:55,654
Now get off the car.

240
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:00,926
May I ask why?

241
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,893
<i>This date has been arranged
by our mothers.</i>

242
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,596
<i>I think we're independent people,</i>

243
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:40,332
<i>so we don't have to stick
to this boring plan.</i>

244
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,268
<i>Happy shopping. See you at ten.</i>

245
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:44,796
She's got some strong personality.

246
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,581
<i>You keep changing your girlfriends.</i>

247
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,917
<i>You can treat her like a normal friend.</i>

248
00:28:05,751 --> 00:28:07,819
If you think she's good, good.

249
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:10,422
If not, I have a long list in my hands.

250
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:11,623
You can pick from it.

251
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,826
How is that?

252
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:17,896
Do you want to date her,
or you want me to find you another one?

253
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:50,495
<i>It's so late, and the wind is so strong.</i>

254
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:57,135
Why hasn't Shancai come home from work?

255
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,804
Honey!

256
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,305
I'll do it.

257
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,207
What are you doing?

258
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,410
I'll stop now. Don't get the food.

259
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,347
Here.

260
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,649
It's amazing.

261
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:11,817
Just look at it for a while.

262
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,418
-Veggie egg porridge.
-Veggie egg porridge.

263
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:17,022
-Honey.
-Yeah.

264
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:19,658
I suddenly got this bad feeling.

265
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,294
-What?
-I think we'll finally be destroyed

266
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:24,630
by that woman, Daoming Feng.

267
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:25,831
Yeah.

268
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:29,368
That woman is up to no good
from the start.

269
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:33,071
She assigns overtime work
to our daughter every night,

270
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,841
but she only gives her a low salary.

271
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,609
Well... No.

272
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:39,478
Money is not the most important problem.

273
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:42,347
The most important thing is, Shancai comes
home so late every day because of her.

274
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:45,050
She wants me to starve to death.

275
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:49,788
So I'll never let her scheme succeed.

276
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,459
-Stop eating.
-Oh, you...

277
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:58,163
-Oh, you...
-Fine. I won't eat.

278
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:04,269
-Mom, I'm home.
-Shancai, you're back.

279
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,571
It smells so good.

280
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,374
Grab some food to restore your strength.

281
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:13,312
So that you'll have the power
to fight that evil woman.

282
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:14,713
Who is that evil woman?

283
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,683
Who else could she be?
Of course, I mean that Daoming Feng.

284
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,318
Fine.

285
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:25,090
Dad, why are you staring at them?

286
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,091
Let's eat.

287
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,159
That's right.

288
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:30,295
You could've said it earlier.
I've waited for it for so long.

289
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:32,264
Why did you come home so late?
Come on. Take a seat.

290
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,599
-Let's eat. Come on.
-All right. I'll put my bag away first.

291
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,234
Okay. Hurry up.

292
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:40,305
Hey. Eat slowly, will you?

293
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:43,575
There are vegetables here.

294
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,377
-Mom, this is for you.
-Okay.

295
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,852
I feel so happy that our whole family
can eat dinner together.

296
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,288
-Dad.
-Yeah?

297
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,657
There won't be any problem
about the car delivery tomorrow, right?

298
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,293
Honey.

299
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:04,363
Your veggie egg porridge is perfect.

300
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:07,199
It's so amazing
that I can never have enough of it.

301
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:10,802
It's all thanks to your sales performance
for this month.

302
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,271
Otherwise, we might not be able
to afford congee.

303
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:24,082
Shancai, you should introduce your dad
to more rich guys.

304
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:26,518
No. I mean, good friends.

305
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:28,453
No matter who they are,

306
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,455
as long as your dad is selling cars,

307
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:32,924
our sales performance will be improved.

308
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:34,826
-Just like the last time,
-Yeah, right.

309
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,762
that Master Huaze Lei.

310
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:39,064
He is our lifesaver.

311
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:41,032
-Thanks, Mom.
-Right? Hey.

312
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:44,169
Got rice on my face?

313
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:45,971
Just wipe it off.

314
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:49,875
Shancai, who is the one
ordering the van from us?

315
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:51,743
It must be Master Qinghe, right?

316
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,712
No.

317
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:58,750
Then it must be
your new aristocratic friend, right?

318
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:01,520
Actually, it's Daoming Si.

319
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:12,063
He...

320
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,765
Has he regained his memory?

321
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:15,634
That's great.

322
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:19,104
Your relationship with Daoming Si,

323
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:22,374
hey, is just like
this veggie egg porridge.

324
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:26,978
It's so thick that no one can break it.

325
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:28,547
You're inseparable.

326
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:31,683
Dad, stop writing your cheesy script.

327
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,718
Daoming Si hasn't regained his memory.

328
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,720
He ordered that van for Yesha.

329
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:38,290
Yesha?

330
00:32:38,924 --> 00:32:41,827
You mean that weird princess?

331
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,196
Shancai.

332
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,800
Things between Daoming Si and me
are not what you're thinking.

333
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:52,270
All I can say is that we're friends now.

334
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:54,940
Maybe it's hard for you to imagine,

335
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:58,009
but this is the most suitable word
to describe our relationship now.

336
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:02,180
At least he won't reject
my concern for him.

337
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,884
This is very important to me.

338
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:07,786
Really very important.

339
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,227
Why are you looking at me like that?

340
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,703
Hello.

341
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,338
Daoming Si.

342
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:30,308
Tomorrow morning at nine o'clock,
you can go talk to my dad.

343
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:32,277
You're welcome.

344
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:39,417
Dad, tomorrow morning at nine o'clock,
Daoming Si will be there to take the van.

345
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,320
No problem. I know.

346
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:44,322
Let's eat.

347
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:47,292
<i>In the story of Daoming Si,</i>

348
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,327
<i>I've turned from the protagonist
into a supporting role.</i>

349
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:51,796
<i>Everyone thinks that I'm stupid,</i>

350
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,198
<i>that I'm crazy.</i>

351
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:55,433
<i>This is how things are.</i>

352
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,869
<i>I can't step out
of the Daoming Si's story.</i>

353
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,805
<i>There's no way out.</i>

354
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:18,757
Guess who I am.

355
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:21,326
What?

356
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:23,962
Are you thinking about something?

357
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:25,163
No.

358
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,600
Let me tell you something.

359
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:30,635
It's bad news. Don't get upset.

360
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:32,437
What is it?

361
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:35,140
Promise me first that you won't get upset.

362
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:36,675
Just tell me already.

363
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:41,146
The breakfast van is ready.

364
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:43,848
-Really? Are you sure?
-Yes.

365
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,517
-Yeah.
-How did you know that?

366
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:46,551
I just saw it.

367
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:48,453
-Really? You saw it.
-Yeah.

368
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,121
Or did they just tell you that?

369
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:51,790
What do you think?

370
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:04,235
Why is your score so low?

371
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:05,704
You suck.

372
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:09,207
Okay, one more round.

373
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,076
I'll defeat you.

374
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:14,980
You've told me that ten times today.

375
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,450
You look down on me, huh?

376
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,586
Maybe I can't beat you in some things,

377
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,722
but today, I'm going to win.

378
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:27,726
Yeah, you're the best.

379
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:33,298
Your mind is somewhere else.
What happened?

380
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:40,839
Whose mind is somewhere else?

381
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:45,543
Just go if you have things to do.

382
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,278
I'm going to be out of the hospital today.

383
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,315
Didn't you say that I got nothing to do?

384
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:54,819
Give me a moment.

385
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:57,122
Hello.

386
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:05,463
Didn't I tell you I'm with Ximen
at the hospital?

387
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,668
This is not an excuse.

388
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,136
This is a reason.

389
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:16,341
Fine. I'll pick her up.

390
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:34,959
Still on your blind date tour?

391
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:39,764
Are you dumping her
because she's too ugly?

392
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:44,069
It's not like that.

393
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,007
So maybe she's too hot
and out of your league?

394
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,711
Nonsense. I, Meizuo--

395
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:54,145
Then go get her.

396
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:55,680
What are you doing here?

397
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:00,418
It's because you're going
to be discharged today.

398
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:01,653
I'll take you home.

399
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:03,154
Oh, come on.

400
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,256
My mom and dad will pick me up
after I get discharged.

401
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:09,060
It's because you like her so much.
You're acting like you don't like her.

402
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:11,763
Who's acting?

403
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:13,665
It hurts! I'm a patient!

404
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:19,537
Fine.

405
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:22,607
I'll go get her.

406
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:27,178
I'll let her know that I'm not a guy
she can handle.

407
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:34,652
What a friend you are! It hurts!

408
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:36,788
Okay. I'm sorry.

409
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:38,089
Soda.

410
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:40,792
Good boy.

411
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:42,761
I'm leaving now.

412
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,263
-Drive safe.
-Okay.

413
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:00,912
Why are we here again?

414
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,616
Shopping must be a hobby
for ladies like you.

415
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,685
I have no interest in shopping
with a lady.

416
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,955
I apologize for our last date.
I should've paid your bill.

417
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,758
Everything you are going to buy today
is on me.

418
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:28,673
You don't need to pick me up.

419
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,047
I don't need to?

420
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:47,859
Be careful.

421
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,696
Mom, I'm fine now.
Don't treat me like a patient.

422
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:53,998
The doctors only allowed you
to leave the hospital.

423
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:56,501
They didn't say
that your body is fully recovered.

424
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,138
I know.

425
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:02,974
That's why I didn't go to the company,
instead I went home with you.

426
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:04,542
Don't think about your company for now.

427
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:07,812
I tell you what. You have to rest at home
for at least one week.

428
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:10,048
Three days.

429
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:11,416
Five days.

430
00:39:12,317 --> 00:39:13,418
Four days, okay?

431
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,086
Five days, that's a deal.

432
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:16,821
I'm not doing business with you.

433
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,625
Ma'am, your husband is back.

434
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,228
I just went to the hospital.

435
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:25,029
The nurse said you had already gone home.

436
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:28,533
I thought you were busy
so I didn't call you.

437
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:34,005
Let me help you set your things up.

438
00:39:34,072 --> 00:39:35,506
You should chat with your dad, okay?

439
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:40,812
Our son just came home.

440
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:44,215
How about we have dinner together tonight?

441
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,285
Right, Mom.

442
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:49,687
It's a chance to help me recover, right?

443
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:52,957
What would you like to eat?

444
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:55,360
Spicy wontons, of course.

445
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:56,961
You can't eat spicy food now.

446
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:00,431
Then they are just wontons, right?

447
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,903
You just can't eat spicy food now, okay?

448
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:19,250
Mom, what's the matter?

449
00:40:19,317 --> 00:40:21,319
<i>Did you send Xiaociao's friend home?</i>

450
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:23,021
What?

451
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,723
<i>I didn't know
that my son is so thoughtful.</i>

452
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,725
<i>I loved that dress.</i>

453
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,628
What are you talking about?

454
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,397
<i>Don't be shy.</i>

455
00:40:32,664 --> 00:40:34,832
<i>Xiaociao brought the gifts home.</i>

456
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:36,701
<i>You're so dumb.</i>

457
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:40,438
<i>Why didn't you send Xiaociao back first
before you sent her friend home?</i>

458
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:43,041
<i>Xiaociao brought a lot of stuff
by herself.</i>

459
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:46,644
<i>You don't know how to take care of others,
just like your dad.</i>

460
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:50,248
<i>Okay, I just want to tell you--</i>

461
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:52,817
-Mom, that--
-<i>I'm very happy now, it's okay.</i>

462
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:17,742
Xiaociao...

463
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:42,767
What do you want?

464
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:45,937
What do you mean?

465
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:49,607
I mean, do you have any idea
what you're doing?

466
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:52,744
My mom and your mom
are planning our future for us.

467
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:53,811
Don't you know that?

468
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:55,913
Yes, I know.

469
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,182
That's why I'm dating you.

470
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:01,586
You mean, you accept
what they planned for you?

471
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:06,124
Do you like being their puppet,
doing whatever they tell you to do?

472
00:42:07,392 --> 00:42:10,762
You're right that my parents
have encouraged me to date you.

473
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:16,000
But considering our family backgrounds
and education,

474
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:17,635
we are perfect for each other.

475
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,804
Why can't you be like me?

476
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,507
Calm down
and try to be in a relationship with me.

477
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:24,509
After all, you're a man.

478
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,677
You won't lose anything,
no matter how this turns out.

479
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:28,980
But we don't have feelings for each other.

480
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:32,583
Feelings can be developed.

481
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,353
And you don't know me at all.

482
00:42:36,087 --> 00:42:37,555
You don't know me, either.

483
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,658
But at least I know you're a good man.

484
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,100
Okay, I'll show you how good I am.

485
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:51,696
Come on.

486
00:43:52,597 --> 00:43:53,431
Tired, right?

487
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:55,633
Cheers.

488
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,301
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

489
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:02,807
Meizuo.

490
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:04,575
Don't you want to introduce us?

491
00:44:11,516 --> 00:44:13,584
Hi, nice to meet you.

492
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:15,853
I'm Xiaociao, girlfriend of Meizuo.

493
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,488
Girlfriend?

494
00:44:18,623 --> 00:44:19,757
What a coincidence.

495
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:22,727
I'm Meizuo's girlfriend number 8.

496
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:25,696
She's number 20.

497
00:44:26,531 --> 00:44:27,565
What about you?

498
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:29,567
What's your number?

499
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:37,241
I don't know what my number is.

500
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,379
But I'm sure that I'm the last one.

501
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:48,152
I think you don't really know Meizuo.

502
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,223
Since you know Meizuo very well,

503
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:55,493
can I consult you about Meizuo
from now on?

504
00:44:56,294 --> 00:44:58,095
You want to consult us?

505
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:05,836
But Meizuo still surprises us
in different ways every now and then.

506
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:10,474
What part do you want to consult with us?

507
00:45:11,342 --> 00:45:14,078
The best parts, of course.

508
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:18,583
But I'm afraid
that you can't learn them well.

509
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:22,486
There's nothing I haven't learned well
since my childhood.

510
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:27,124
Especially your so-called best parts.

511
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,366
Can you learn something like this well?

512
00:46:14,739 --> 00:46:16,941
Hurry up, Daoming Si
has regained his memory!

513
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:26,577
