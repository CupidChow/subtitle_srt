1
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,456
I have a question.

2
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:03,490
Don't get mad at me.

3
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,359
What is it?

4
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,262
How come there are rumors
that something has happened to Daoming Si?

5
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,632
Does it?

6
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,967
Who did you hear it from?

7
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,170
The missing person's column
on the newspapers

8
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,905
and the big billboard on the streets.

9
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,879
You must be very concerned, right?

10
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:27,180
You guys are so close.

11
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,852
Isn't this a lifestyle interview?

12
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,453
How did it turn into a psychological one?

13
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:37,724
Sorry, I'm just too curious about F4.

14
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:41,995
So what have you been up to?

15
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:44,898
Nothing.

16
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,600
Playing basketball.

17
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,201
Watching movies.

18
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,870
Visiting pubs sometimes.

19
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:50,971
Listening to music.

20
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,074
You like going to pubs?

21
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,946
Which ones can you recommend to me?

22
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:04,217
There are so many of them,
and you still need me to recommend?

23
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:10,223
There's a pub
before the entrance of the alley.

24
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,325
It's got a pretty nice atmosphere.

25
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,927
Sometimes I go there.

26
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,228
Really?

27
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,900
What's it called?

28
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,145
I'm pissed off.

29
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,852
Oh, right.

30
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,321
Here is the postcard
that Ah Si and Shancai sent from Spain.

31
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,500
This is definitely the place.

32
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,408
Come on, what's wrong with you?

33
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,684
To enter or not, it's up to you.

34
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,154
Yesha.

35
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:16,423
Gotta go now.

36
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,476
It's like a prophecy.

37
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:42,682
Ah Si and Shancai are now heading
in different directions.

38
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,261
It feels weird not having Ah Si around.

39
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:05,939
-Hey, it's on you.
-Okay.

40
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:10,477
-A bar beer, please.
-Okay.

41
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:42,142
Come on, it's been a while since
you last hung out here.

42
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:44,177
Come dance with me, will you?

43
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:46,012
But there's something I need
to discuss with them.

44
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,215
Yeah right, you say that every time.

45
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:51,017
-Come, let's go dancing.
-Ask Meizuo instead.

46
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,085
Meizuo's better at dancing.

47
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:54,354
I don't care,
you have to go dancing with me.

48
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:55,255
Let's go.

49
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:56,590
-We'll do it another day.
-Let's go.

50
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,625
I don't care. Let's go right now.

51
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,060
-Oh, come on, you be good...
-Let's go.

52
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,161
Another day, all right?

53
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:02,495
Right now.

54
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:03,663
I'm busy now.

55
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,167
We'll go dance now.
You haven't been out for a while anyway.

56
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,605
All right, then we'll all go dancing.

57
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:12,906
Okay?

58
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:14,608
Let's go!

59
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,677
Today is my reunion with my best friends.

60
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,346
Don't be a killjoy, okay?

61
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:22,115
All right.

62
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,885
I'll let you go this time.

63
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,686
Remember to call me next time.

64
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:27,988
Remember!

65
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,422
I'm leaving now. Bye.

66
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:33,894
Look at Ximen.

67
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,995
So cool.

68
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:36,796
So handsome.

69
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,665
Don't play dumb.

70
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,667
What are you flattering him for?

71
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,036
Someone so cocky like Ximen
won't give a damn.

72
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,938
Come on. Have one more drink.

73
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,240
Come on, have a drink.

74
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:48,642
He's from a prominent family.

75
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,143
-It's much better than ours.
-Yeah.

76
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,245
-We're not worthy to talk with him.
-Come...

77
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:56,249
I don't believe it, the F4
are always very well-mannered at school.

78
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,284
Watch me.

79
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,390
Guys.

80
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,625
Treat me as the hot girl who just left.

81
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,328
Let your junior have the honor
to have a drink with you.

82
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,398
Excuse me.

83
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:12,732
I think we're not at the same table.

84
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:13,733
Please go back to yours.

85
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,103
Michael.

86
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,705
You're embarrassing yourself.

87
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,108
They're the famous F4.

88
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:24,010
Still F4?

89
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:25,512
More like F3 now.

90
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,716
Well said. F4 is no more.

91
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,385
Drink...

92
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:33,553
F3.

93
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,355
Funny!

94
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,190
Funny Three!

95
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:41,027
Funny Three, let me toast you.

96
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:53,273
Just like before.

97
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,774
It's time to renovate your place.

98
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,758
What do you want?

99
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:12,792
Let go!

100
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,060
Daoming Si.

101
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:22,769
Ah Si.

102
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,141
Daoming Si.

103
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,042
I'll get you back.

104
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,350
Ah Si.

105
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:41,454
It's really you.

106
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:42,555
Ah Si.

107
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:48,695
Ah Si.

108
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:01,441
Ah Si...

109
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,757
Ah Si.

110
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:18,658
Ah Si.

111
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:19,559
Ah Si.

112
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,128
Ah Si.

113
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:25,331
Ah Si.

114
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:27,200
Ah Si.

115
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:29,903
Ah Si.

116
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:31,738
-Ah Si.
-Ah Si.

117
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,981
-Ah Si.
-Ah Si.

118
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:43,049
Ah Si.

119
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,419
-Ah Si.
-Ah Si.

120
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:49,556
Ah Si.

121
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:01,434
Ah Si, what are you running for?

122
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:03,536
Look closely, it's us.

123
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,177
Ah Si really can't remember anything.

124
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:12,946
He can!

125
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,114
Or he wouldn't punch him.

126
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:16,349
It doesn't matter what you remember
and what you forget.

127
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,451
Come back with us.
We will make you remember.

128
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:22,856
Ah Si.

129
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,824
Why would I know people like you?

130
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:27,293
The four of us have been together
for the past 20 years.

131
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:29,629
How could I be like you?

132
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:30,530
I'm not like you.

133
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:33,933
What are you talking about?

134
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,769
Why don't you ask yourself
why you intervened earlier?

135
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:45,011
That's because no matter
what happens to any one of us,

136
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,680
all of us will step forward at once.

137
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:50,783
Even if it means sacrificing ourselves.

138
00:10:58,591 --> 00:10:59,559
Ah Si.

139
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,963
-Because we're best...
-Get lost!

140
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:05,031
Ah Si.

141
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,968
Ah Si...

142
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:11,571
Ah Si.

143
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:21,548
What are you running for?

144
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:41,167
Meizuo.

145
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:56,816
I hate my past!

146
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:57,884
Nonsense!

147
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,522
You can hate your past,

148
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,490
but you can't forget about Shancai.

149
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,208
Ah Si.

150
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:53,172
What are you doing, Meizuo?

151
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:05,785
How can he forget everything?

152
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:10,690
He has forgotten every bit of the past.

153
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:12,859
Look on the brighter side.

154
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,561
At least that punch earlier
was totally what Ah Si would do.

155
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,299
So he remembers, right?

156
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,567
He did that for us, right?

157
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:27,106
Right?

158
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:28,841
Meizuo.

159
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:30,510
Admit it.

160
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,213
Ah Si really doesn't remember anything.

161
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,418
Have you forgotten what he just said?

162
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:42,021
Not only he doubted us,

163
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:46,192
he also doubted his own past, right?

164
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,832
He was always domineering.

165
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,334
He loved to command.

166
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,136
I did what he told me to do.

167
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,607
I only want him to do
what I tell him to do this time.

168
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:04,377
Is this too much to ask?

169
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:21,060
Ah Si!

170
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:36,042
It's really you.

171
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,043
<i>Ah Si.</i>

172
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,012
Come back with us.

173
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,247
We will make you remember.

174
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:45,952
Ah Si.

175
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,420
Why would I know people like you?

176
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,856
The four of us have been together
for the past 20 years.

177
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,733
AH SI, I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU FOREVER.

178
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:45,011
AH SI, I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU FOREVER.

179
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:02,582
You're back.

180
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:05,952
And?

181
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,454
And...

182
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,123
I ran away.

183
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,292
You ran away?

184
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:14,393
Why?

185
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:19,198
I don't know.

186
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:21,834
It's just...

187
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,171
Yesha.

188
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,441
Must I retrieve my past?

189
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:31,744
Isn't that what you want most?

190
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:34,847
If...

191
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:40,353
I mean, if I don't like my past at all,

192
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,389
why should I go find them?

193
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,961
You mean you don't like them?

194
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,234
I feel that there's nothing memorable

195
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,939
about my past.

196
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,911
Be it my family

197
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:07,947
or my friends.

198
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,050
None of them are what I expected.

199
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,656
Didn't you say that I was lucky

200
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:18,858
to be able to live again?

201
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:24,130
Then should I relive the new life
of "Ah Xing"?

202
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,507
Living is difficult.

203
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:36,208
Have you felt that?

204
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,814
I'll start looking for work tomorrow.

205
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:46,419
Ah Xing...

206
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:05,838

Got it.

243
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,220
-Which table?
-Am I hired?

244
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:10,522
Aren't you working right now?

245
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:12,725
I ran out of oil. A bottle of oil. Quick.

246
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,928

furious, accurate. Hurry!

-Iced coffee, okay.

251
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:33,946
Table A faces the street.

-What did you say your name was?
-My name is Ah Xing.

Thank you.

261
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:14,720
Here.

262
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,789
Two fried eggs. I'm off to the toilet.

263
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:20,326
Two...

264
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,368
What are you doing?

265
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:32,838
No, because I haven't...

266
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:34,807
You can't fry eggs?

267
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:36,608
You can't even fry eggs?

268
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:37,910
Go...

269
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,144
I'm sorry, we can't hire you.

270
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:41,246
How can we hire you
when you can't even fry an egg?

271
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,149
Don't stand in the way.
I'm busy now, all right?

272
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:45,818
Go!

273
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:53,359
Sir, can you clean the table?

274
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:56,495
Da Xin.

275
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:58,097
I can't, I'm busy.

276
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,665
Yilin...

277
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,166
I'm taking an order!

278
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:05,070
Life is difficult.

279
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:06,638
Have you felt that?

280
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:46,412
These are the carrots
that daddy eats every day.

281
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:47,980
And the fried egg that mommy loves.

282
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,520
I'm overjoyed.

283
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:57,656
To be able to have breakfast
cooked by Shancai.

284
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:00,692
It doesn't have to be stir-fried carrots.

285
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:03,128
I'll even take raw carrots.

286
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,064
You can treat me like a rabbit.

287
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,165
I'll gnaw carrots every day.

288
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:07,833
Let's eat.

289
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,844
Mom, what's wrong?

290
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:24,383
We are actually very worried about you.

291
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:28,487
We watch you leave home early
and come home late every day, working.

292
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,291
You're upset.

293
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:34,193
At night, you will hide
in your bedroom crying.

294
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,963
We will hide in our bedroom crying too.

295
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,833
I don't know what to do,

296
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:43,268
so I went to the temple and worship.

297
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:44,369
Cast moon blocks.

298
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,507
Why is my daughter's life so hard?

299
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:50,909
Mom, I'm all right.

300
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,746
That's right.

301
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:56,315
It's all right.

302
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:57,549
We are all alright.

303
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:00,185
You see.

304
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:02,621
My car selling business
is getting better now.

305
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,657
And Shancai has pulled herself together.

306
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:08,494
As long as we are happy
together every day,

307
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,396
nothing will stop us, right?

308
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:14,299
As long as I'm happy,

309
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:16,068
Shancai is happy.

310
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,236
As long as Shancai is happy,

311
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,971
your mother is happy.

312
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,840
We... will all be happy.

313
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:24,209
Let's eat.

314
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:25,911
We will be happy.

315
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:39,458
Guys...

316
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,028
From today,
Master Ximen will take on the role

317
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:47,132
of business promotion manager.

318
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,935
Everybody must do their best

319
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:52,504
to assist Master Ximen.

320
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:56,842
You must learn how things work
in the corporation the fastest you can.

321
00:27:58,076 --> 00:27:59,811
Let's welcome Young Master Ximen.

322
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,248
Looking forward to working with you.

323
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,785
She is your secretary,

324
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,020
Ms. Fang.

325
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:10,189
Greetings, Young Master Ximen.

326
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:13,892
Isn't she beautiful?

327
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:15,861
Uncle,

328
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,131
I'll get distracted working
with such a beauty.

329
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,873
Hello, yes, 3:00 p.m.

330
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,840
No problem...

331
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,209
Yes.

332
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:36,748
Excuse me, please hang on a moment.

333
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:40,419
Which department do you work in?

334
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,021
Master.

335
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:45,324
I'm Xu Shaoyang
from the business department.

336
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:47,125
Xu Shaoyang.

337
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:48,894
You'll be my secretary.

338
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:50,629
Is that all right?

339
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:51,663
Me?

340
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:52,998
Of course.

341
00:28:57,002 --> 00:28:58,103
Come in, master.

342
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,746
-Master Ximen.
-Just call me Manager.

343
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:09,348
Don't call me "master."

344
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:10,582
Yes, Manager.

345
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:12,251
Manager, what time do you usually dine?

346
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:13,685
Something you like in particular?

347
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,387
Or don't like, in particular?

348
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:19,057
And... Manager.

349
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,592
What time do you have afternoon tea?

350
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:21,627
Should I prepare--

351
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:22,828
I'm here to work.

352
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:25,731
I'm sorry.

353
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,166
I was wrong, I'm sorry.

354
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:32,104
Please show me
the marketing plan for this season.

355
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,405
And later at 2:00 p.m,

356
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:35,440
gather the people in the creative
department. We'll have a meeting.

357
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:37,175
-Today?
-Is there a problem?

358
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:40,445
Young Master... I mean, Manager.

359
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:41,713
This is your first day of work...

360
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:46,051
Nothing, I'll contact
the creative department now.

361
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:41,306
Why are you here?

362
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:45,444
Why are you up so early today?

363
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,647
What, can I not be up early?

364
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,352
What's wrong?

365
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:57,589
The billboard is off.

366
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,994
I know.

367
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:06,732
Can you have someone to substitute
for you this morning?

368
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,536
-Why should I have someone--
-Please.

369
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:35,060
Wow, it feels so good.

370
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:37,529
I haven't come to the beach
for a long time.

371
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,499
Remember the time we went to Okinawa?

372
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:41,767
Of course.

373
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,335
Both you and Ximen came with hot girls.

374
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,637
-Did we?
-You did.

375
00:31:45,704 --> 00:31:47,406
They all have perfect curves.

376
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:48,907
It made me feel inferior.

377
00:31:48,974 --> 00:31:50,108
And you also--

378
00:31:50,175 --> 00:31:51,777
We saw Ah Si.

379
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:53,779
Where?

380
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:57,315
At the pub.

381
00:31:57,716 --> 00:31:58,750
Where is he now?

382
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:01,486
He fought for us.

383
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:02,954
And then he ran away.

384
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:04,990
We couldn't catch up with him.

385
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,895
He really doesn't remember anything.

386
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:12,864
From afar, I saw him
in his ragged T-shirt,

387
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,332
worn-out jeans,

388
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:16,067
his expression,

389
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:18,203
and his attitude.

390
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:21,740
Suddenly, I got scared.

391
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:23,642
Of what?

392
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:25,577
He didn't want to go back
to the past at all.

393
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:27,979
He only wants to live his present life.

394
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:34,920
So, is he doing great now?

395
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:38,924
Maybe.

396
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:43,528
Then, I'm at ease.

397
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:47,432
Shancai, are you not worried
that Ah Si will never come back?

398
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:49,134
What for?

399
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:51,603
Not even you could catch up with him.

400
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,409
The moment Ah Si stood before us,

401
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,411
I had a strange feeling.

402
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:03,548
A part of me was envious of him.

403
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:05,851
He lost his memory,

404
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:07,752
and his identity.

405
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,954
However,

406
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,022
he's found a new life.

407
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:13,658
Do you know?

408
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,360
Two days later, I'll be putting on a suit,

409
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:16,828
and a necktie,

410
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:18,063
and start a boring life

411
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:20,198
where I punch in and out
when I go to and leave work.

412
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,267
Can you imagine me like that?

413
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,070
You must look very handsome.

414
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,874
Of course.

415
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:32,143
But I don't want to become
someone like that.

416
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:35,480
Actually...

417
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:38,450
This is just what the world is like.

418
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:42,153
It is impossible for anyone
to live the life they want.

419
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:46,224
But don't you think
it's also what's interesting about it

420
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,128
Interesting? How?

421
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:53,365
Most of the time,
our wishes don't come true.

422
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:57,102
When they do,
you'll be particularly happy.

423
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:00,005
I mean it.

424
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:01,406
Take now, for instance.

425
00:34:01,473 --> 00:34:03,241
If we come to see the ocean every day,

426
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:04,976
there wouldn't be anything
special about it.

427
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,379
But if we sneak a break
from busy work at times,

428
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:09,114
we would find the ocean is blue,

429
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,548
the wind is comforting,

430
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:11,983
and our moods are good.

431
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,520
You stir-fried Shancai.

432
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:16,788
You're a special one.

433
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:19,357
I am. Since you're always surrounded
by pretty women,

434
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,226
I become special.

435
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:22,928
Shancai.

436
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:24,362
You've finally recovered.

437
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:27,933
I was worried
that you would have a meltdown

438
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,701
because the billboard is off.

439
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,207
Daoming Si is living his new life.

440
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,310
How can I not move on?

441
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:41,780
We never know
what's going to happen tomorrow,

442
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:44,749
unless we take a big step forward
to take a good look at it.

443
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,919
Welcome your new life, Meizuo.

444
00:34:47,986 --> 00:34:49,154
Go for it.

445
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:51,957
Yeah.

446
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:53,191
Go for it.

447
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:54,659
Go for it...

448
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:56,361
Go for it!

449
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:01,266
Go for it!

450
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:05,870
Eighty-three hundred.

451
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,105
Eighty-four hundred.

452
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:08,873
What are you doing? I'm counting money.

453
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,041
I was just borrowing.

454
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,476
-Eighty-five hundred.
-I got no money.

455
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:13,111
Eighty-six hundred, eighty-seven hundred.

456
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:14,312
Eighty-eight hundred.

457
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:18,249
Don't you guys find it strange?

458
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,185
Last name is Ah. First name is Xing.

459
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:22,787
And we know nothing else about him.

460
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:24,489
So strange.

461
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,057
Who cares about his name.

462
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,259
How can I hire him
when he can't even fry eggs?

463
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:30,962
Don't be so mean.

464
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:34,065
At least he's been cleaning tables
the whole morning

465
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,134
and doing dishes afterward, right?

466
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:38,269
I didn't ask him to.

467
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,640
You're so petty-minded.

468
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:42,774
Took your gain for granted.

469
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:44,042
Why be such a penny pincher?

470
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:46,277
Are you kidding me?
How much do I make per day?

471
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:47,912
I must pinch my pennies.

472
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,849
He hasn't rested since.

473
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,085
At least he works harder than Da Xin.

474
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:59,491
How can you compare him with Da Xin?

475
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:00,892
Yeah.

476
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,495
You're comparing him to me.

477
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:04,562
Are you serious?

478
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:08,033
I am Lun's good classmate.

479
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:13,705
I'm saying, I already have
one lazy worker in my restaurant.

480
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:14,973
If I hire one more,

481
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,142
you might as well be the owner.
I'll be your employee.

482
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,444
Be my foot!

483
00:36:19,978 --> 00:36:21,246
You're insulting me, are you?

484
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:22,147
It's the truth.

485
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:23,415
Are you insulting me?

486
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:25,116
-What did I say?
-Are you insulting me?

487
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,685
-What did I say?
-Are you insulting me?

488
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,119
What's wrong with you two?

489
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:12,630
Um, well...

490
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,867
Thanks for the hard work, Ah Xing.

491
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:16,935
It's nothing.

492
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:20,271
I've thought about it.

493
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:24,843
And I think we really can't hire
someone who can't fry eggs.

494
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:28,980
Take this as your pay for today.

495
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,954
Go find a job that suits you.

496
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,322
Don't waste your time here.

497
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:13,158
Look.

498
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:14,125
Aren't they beautiful?

499
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:19,364
These are exclusively designed
by the chef for Chinese Valentine's Day.

500
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:21,399
Right.

501
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,368
Chinese Valentine's Day is two days away.

502
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:27,839
I wonder if they could attract customers,
to promote the sales.

503
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:31,209
There weren't so many holidays
going on in the past.

504
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:35,580
Good thing is, young people nowadays
are too emotional,

505
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,582
which brings us
a lot of business opportunities.

506
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:42,487
But the student employees all chose
to take leaves on Valentine's Day.

507
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:44,656
I can't find anyone
to keep the shop for me.

508
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,625
Ma'am, I'll work overtime.

509
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:48,760
Can you do that?

510
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:50,628
But...

511
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:53,331
Your tall, handsome boyfriend.

512
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:54,933
Isn't he taking you anywhere to celebrate?

513
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,937
If two people can be together,

514
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,405
every day is Valentine's Day.

515
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:01,439
It doesn't matter to me.

516
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:04,108
Well, okay, that's a deal.

517
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,911
I'll pay you double on that day.

518
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:08,613
Thank you, ma'am.

519
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,681
You're welcome.

520
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:11,549
It's you that I should thank.

521
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,218
So gross.

522
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:07,598
What are you doing?

523
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:12,770
Life is really difficult.

524
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,440
I can't even fry an egg.

525
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:17,909
I was a fool.

526
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:22,146
Didn't you say you wanted to live again?

527
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:25,149
Then let's learn everything
from the baby steps.

528
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:29,287
After all, I can't fry eggs, either.

529
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:31,522
Let's learn together. Come here.

530
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,706
That's my oil. Use sparingly.

531
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,482
But, fried eggs need...

532
00:41:57,548 --> 00:41:59,183
You don't need to use that much.

533
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:00,451
Remove it.

534
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:02,453
What should we do?

535
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,554
You drink it, such a waste...

536
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:04,589
You drink first.

537
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:06,758
Come on.

538
00:42:18,169 --> 00:42:19,003
Egg.

539
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:21,272
Fry an egg.

540
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,277
Crack it here.

541
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:27,979
On here?

542
00:42:29,414 --> 00:42:30,915
Not drop the whole thing!

543
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:29,073
It's burnt...

544
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:32,477
Yesha, you have to help me.

545
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:36,814
It's burnt.

546
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:40,585
Quick. Save this egg.

547
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,621
Look, it's beautiful.

548
00:43:44,055 --> 00:43:45,423
It will work...

549
00:43:46,057 --> 00:43:47,058
Yes!

550
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:50,261
For real, look at that.

551
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:51,929
This is...

552
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:54,665
I fried this egg.

553
00:44:09,881 --> 00:44:10,882
Go up a little more...

554
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,650
To the left...

555
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:13,951
Just a little bit.

556
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,253
Perfect.

557
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,088
Is that okay?

558
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:21,526
Perfect...

559
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:24,729
Good, call me when it's done.

560
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:25,830
Done your foot.

561
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,999
Perfect...

562
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,202
Be more careful.

563
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:35,306
Welcome.

564
00:44:35,573 --> 00:44:36,874
Welcome.

565
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:41,979
You... Why are you here again?

566
00:44:43,648 --> 00:44:45,416
I'm looking for a job.

567
00:44:45,483 --> 00:44:46,584
But yesterday, didn't I...

568
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:48,786
Welcome.

569
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:49,754
Welcome.

570
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:50,855
Welcome.

571
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:52,757
So pretty.

572
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:00,164
Miss, please have a seat.

573
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:01,432
Table for one?

574
00:45:03,935 --> 00:45:05,269
What would you like?

575
00:45:05,336 --> 00:45:06,671
I would like to order a fried egg.

576
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:07,738
Fried egg, no problem.

577
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:09,140
I want a fried egg, cooked by him.

578
00:45:09,941 --> 00:45:10,808
By him?

579
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,442
