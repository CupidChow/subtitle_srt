1
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,156
Hello.

2
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,925
<i>Shancai, I'm Mimi, your junior in Yingde.</i>

3
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:40,627
Mimi?

4
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,697
<i>Shancai, please accept
my interview invitation.</i>

5
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:45,899
What interview?

6
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,735
<i>Shancai, I'm standing
in front of your house right now.</i>

7
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:50,037
<i>Can we do it now?</i>

8
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,572
What? Now?

9
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,012
Here you are.

10
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,414
Shancai, let's get started.

11
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:01,948
Hold on, Mimi.

12
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,284
Why do you want to interview me?

13
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:08,655
Shancai, I like Qinghe.

14
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:12,459
So I'm trying my best to hook up with him.

15
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,363
Shancai, you are his best friend.

16
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,865
So I hope you can tell me something
about Qinghe,

17
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:22,636
like his hobbies, favorites,
and preferences.

18
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,271
I hope you can tell me everything.

19
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:28,208
Mimi, you are so straightforward.

20
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:31,311
Qinghe doesn't like girls
that are too straightforward?

21
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,579
No.

22
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:35,982
I mean, I admire
straightforward people like you.

23
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:40,187
If you like me,
then Qinghe will like me, too.

24
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,355
I'm more confident now...

25
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:48,061
because for Qinghe, you are perfect.

26
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:52,199
So, Shancai, please allow me
to imitate you in every aspect.

27
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,000
Imitate?

28
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:57,137
Mimi, everyone has their unique qualities.

29
00:03:57,204 --> 00:04:00,207
You don't have to imitate others.
It doesn't make sense.

30
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,342
It does.

31
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:05,112
Shancai, I'm telling you,

32
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:08,348
this is the first time
I had a crush on a guy.

33
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:11,118
It feels so good.

34
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:17,290
Meeting Qinghe at school
is my happiest moment.

35
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,429
He hasn't fallen in love with me yet,

36
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:26,032
but as long as I'm around Qinghe

37
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,970
I have the chance to show him my love.

38
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:34,374
Every day is so meaningful to me now.

39
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,390
Mimi, don't you feel tired?

40
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,426
No, not a bit.

41
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:02,068
I put my feelings inside my heart.

42
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:07,874
One day, Qinghe will be touched
by everything I've done.

43
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:11,378
He will.

44
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:15,515
One day he'll see all your efforts.

45
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:26,359
Shancai, my dad said a girl like you
who's willing to help her girl friends

46
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,428
must be a kind girl.

47
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:30,964
So you will definitely find
your happiness.

48
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,117
Where am I?

49
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:02,162
Hey, where's Shancai?

50
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,333
I'm almost late.

51
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,335
I shouldn't have chatted
with Mimi yesterday.

52
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,383
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

53
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,384
No.

54
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:04,891
What a coincidence.

55
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:06,693
Yeah, what a coincidence.

56
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:16,469
I didn't know you eat this, too.

57
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,372
Doesn't everyone eat this?

58
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:27,380
Your mouth...

59
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,987
Is it more delicious with this?

60
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:35,755
The mustard?

61
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:36,690
Yeah.

62
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,591
You add mustard when you eat
a submarine sandwich.

63
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:42,929
-Really?
-Yeah.

64
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,635
It's not enough.

65
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:50,804
Add some more.

66
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,811
This much?

67
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,314
It's good. Try it yourself.

68
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:10,357
You're right.

69
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:11,524
I told you so.

70
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,665
Is everything okay at work?

71
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,301
Yeah.

72
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:24,404
Except I'm so slow
so when I get my work done,

73
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:25,939
it's usually very late.

74
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:32,212
It's good to have work to do, unlike me,
who's got nothing to do in my office.

75
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,647
I'm either reading a proposal
or signing something.

76
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:37,450
When I'm too bored, I go to the rooftop
to get some fresh air.

77
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:40,153
Do you really think it's better
to have work to do?

78
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,990
In the past you would...

79
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:52,432
Because you're the manager
who should be making decisions.

80
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:56,169
I was assigned
to the General Affairs Department.

81
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:59,439
I have to do inventory the whole day,
and I haven't finished one-fifth of it.

82
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,640
My neck is almost broken.

83
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,344
You can finish it tomorrow.

84
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:07,013
I can't. I have to finish
the inventory today.

85
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,249
I should hand in the report
to the manager tomorrow morning.

86
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,384
There's no one helping you?

87
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:15,321
Everyone has got their own share of work.

88
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:23,763
I'll help you.

89
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:26,699
You'll help me?

90
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:33,406
Thank you.

91
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,658
You can start from that side.

92
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,293
All right.

93
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:09,943
Here?

94
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:18,918
It's 91013117.

95
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,557
This one is 91013432.

96
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:33,299
This is 91021812.

97
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:38,638
Next is 91013107.

98
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,178
This is 91020963.

99
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,284
This one is 91012907.

100
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,616
Let's make a deal, okay?

101
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,155
I promise I won't escape.

102
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:53,025
When the time is up,
I'll go back to that cold palace.

103
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,895
I won't tell them our secret.

104
00:14:56,662 --> 00:15:01,701
So, from now on, you can live your life
and I'll wander about by myself.

105
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:03,736
You don't have to follow me anymore, okay?

106
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,011
You don't consider me your friend?

107
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,748
I'm sorry, Miss Yesha. This is my duty.

108
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:23,756
I know you're passionate about your job.

109
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:26,692
Fine. Just tell me when you're tired,

110
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,628
and we'll go back
to the cold palace, okay?

111
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,498
Throw this away for me.

112
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:40,373
Miss Yesha!

113
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:44,377
Miss Yesha!

114
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,783
Miss Yesha!

115
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:56,722
-Aren't you--
-Aren't you...

116
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,057
Hurry, he's chasing me.

117
00:15:58,591 --> 00:15:59,459
Who is he?

118
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:00,393
Miss Yesha!

119
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,028
Come on. Get on.

120
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,095
Hurry.

121
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,565
Miss Yesha!

122
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:07,400
Miss Yesha!

123
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,734
Miss Yesha!

124
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,041
Come on, hurry.

125
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,379
Miss Yesha.

126
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,416
I'll go back to the cold palace by myself.

127
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,384
Miss Yesha!

128
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:26,886
Miss Yesha!

129
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:28,621
Miss Yesha!

130
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:37,763
You mean that man didn't come
to kidnap you, but to protect you?

131
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,872
Is it too cruel to treat him that way?

132
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,742
Why do I need protection?

133
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,077
Just think about it.

134
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,913
If there's always someone following you
and keeping an eye on you,

135
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,214
won't you get annoyed?

136
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,186
If it's a pretty girl...

137
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,321
I guess not.

138
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:06,158
We were shocked when we saw the news
about your engagement.

139
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,661
Who knew that Ah Xing
is such an important person.

140
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,997
No wonder he can't even fry an egg.

141
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:19,972
Luckily, you are very kind, or who else
would hire a man who can't fry an egg?

142
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:25,478
Do you need more hands here these days?

143
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:28,814
I have nothing to do every day.
I can work here.

144
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:40,993
We'll keep the business running
until the end of this month.

145
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,898
Why? Business is good, right?

146
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,434
Because business is so good,

147
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:50,636
the landlord decided to run
the business by himself.

148
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,541
Where are you moving?

149
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:59,779
I just went out to find a new place.
And then I ran into you.

150
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,749
I thought we would set off in two years.

151
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,319
I didn't know something like this
would happen.

152
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,557
Forget it since we can't find one now.

153
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,326
We'll set off on our island tour.

154
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:15,995
We'll cross the bridge when we come to it.

155
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:18,431
Yeah.

156
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:23,302
We should go on an island tour
before we set off on our world tour.

157
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,771
-Isn't it cool to travel around Taiwan?
-Yeah.

158
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,109
It's five now.

159
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:31,944
Daoming Si, it's time to get off work.

160
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,347
What? Already?

161
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:36,382
How will you manage by yourself?

162
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,818
Don't worry. There's only a few left.

163
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,887
Are you sure you can do it?

164
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,767
Daoming Si!

165
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,143
Daoming Si.

166
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,353
-Daoming Si.
-Stay back!

167
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:17,356
Okay. I'll stay back.

168
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:20,226
Relax. I will leave you alone.

169
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:47,386
Well...

170
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,157
I'm sorry.

171
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:54,360
That's okay.

172
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,964
May I ask you what happened?

173
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,768
I just...

174
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,771
I just had a headache.

175
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:09,575
Maybe...

176
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,479
I got it from the car accident.

177
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:17,349
Do you often have headaches?

178
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:20,619
Not really.

179
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,789
Sometimes, in my mind...

180
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,860
there are these strange...

181
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:29,662
images.

182
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:33,232
Then I will have a headache.

183
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:35,935
I'm sorry.

184
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:38,104
You must be too exhausted from work.

185
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,206
No.

186
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:42,908
Shancai.

187
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,514
Did you...

188
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:53,886
save me in the past?

189
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:56,756
Do you remember?

190
00:20:57,123 --> 00:20:58,057
No.

191
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:04,063
I think... I had this feeling before,

192
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,801
when I saw you got caught
under the ladder.

193
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,836
This situation...

194
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,341
I've been through it before.

195
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,710
It's something like a...

196
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:21,347
A chair?

197
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:22,314
Right.

198
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:23,816
I was kidnapped at that time.

199
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,651
They blackmailed you
by holding me hostage.

200
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:28,320
We were in a very old warehouse.

201
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,389
They beat you and torture you
in front of me.

202
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,492
You were badly hurt,
but you didn't fight back,

203
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:36,128
because you were afraid
that they would hurt me.

204
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,397
They got angrier
because you didn't fight back.

205
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:39,665
Finally, they took a chair--

206
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:41,000
Stop!

207
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:43,602
You remember.

208
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,137
-Do you remember?
-No.

209
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:47,840
Think harder.

210
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,441
Please, Daoming Si.

211
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,221
Shancai, I...

212
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:04,757
I'm sorry.

213
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:09,361
Don't say sorry to me.

214
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,030
Tell me,

215
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:15,401
you treasure those memories
somewhere in your heart, right?

216
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,170
Right, Daoming Si?

217
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,705
I really don't know.

218
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:26,612
I'm already a different person
without those memories.

219
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:34,887
Who will I be if I recall my past?

220
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,091
Can I be that person again?

221
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,561
Who can tell me?

222
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,141
Even you can't, right?

223
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:01,981
This is my own problem.

224
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:06,719
No one can help me.

225
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,626
<i>I had no idea Daoming Si is so stressed.</i>

226
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,728
<i>I didn't know he's so scared.</i>

227
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:18,797
<i>Why am I so selfish?</i>

228
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:21,834
<i>All I care about
is him remembering everything.</i>

229
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,802
<i>I neglected his feelings.</i>

230
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:29,775
<i>Daoming Si is still himself
even if he can't remember anything.</i>

231
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:35,814
<i>From now on, I should face
the new Daoming Si.</i>

232
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:44,256
Ma'am.

233
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:46,392
Any news?

234
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:47,626
Not yet.

235
00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:17,756
What are you doing here?

236
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,125
How can you not know?

237
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,662
I hate it when people are meddling
with my affairs,

238
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:25,064
telling me where to go,

239
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,066
telling me what to do.

240
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,401
I didn't say anything.

241
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,304
I'm just waiting for you.

242
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,375
Why don't you wait in the house?
It's raining.

243
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,278
How long will you stand there?

244
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,157
Let's go.

245
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:35,401
Why didn't you call someone
to pick you up?

246
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:38,404
You're soaked.

247
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:41,707
-Yutian.
-Yes.

248
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:47,079
Tell the servants to prepare warm baths
for Yesha and Daoming Si.

249
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:48,180
Yes, ma'am.

250
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:56,622
Thank you for your kindness.

251
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,257
Ordering your men to follow me everywhere.

252
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,759
I am used to being free

253
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,828
so there's no need
to have me followed around.

254
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:06,031
Ah Si understands me.

255
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,311
Why did you order your men
to follow Yesha?

256
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,247
I was concerned about her safety.

257
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,650
She is a princess.

258
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:29,588
What's wrong with sending
a bodyguard along with her?

259
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:36,028
Maybe you're right,
but please don't do it again,

260
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,731
unless you want to drive Yesha away.

261
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:05,324
<i>Brave Yesha.</i>

262
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,126
<i>Brave Yesha.</i>

263
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,063
AH SI CALLING

264
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:12,264
<i>Brave Yesha.</i>

265
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:14,133
<i>Brave Yesha.</i>

266
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,402
<i>Brave Yesha.</i>

267
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,571
<i>Brave Yesha.</i>

268
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:20,672
Hello.

269
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,441
<i>Hi.</i>

270
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,610
Did you like your new bodyguard?

271
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,479
This one is much cuter.

272
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:29,548
Where did you go to have fun today?

273
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:31,250
What about you?

274
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:34,119
Hey, I asked you first.

275
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,421
I won't say anything
if you don't say anything.

276
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:37,623
You...

277
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:40,125
Why are you so mean?

278
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:45,230
I was very busy today.

279
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:47,332
I went to help Shancai in the warehouse.

280
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:54,106
My friend is pretty nice, right?

281
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,774
She...

282
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:57,643
She is much cuter than you.

283
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,145
Your friend is pretty nice, too.

284
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:02,848
What? My friend?

285
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:05,017
Da Xin and his gang.

286
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:07,686
I ran into Da Xin today.

287
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:10,255
He helped me shake off the men
sent by your mom.

288
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:15,160
You met them?

289
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:17,930
Really? Did they treat you to a meal?

290
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,266
They're closing down
the breakfast restaurant.

291
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,202
Then what will they do?

292
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:24,870
I don't know.

293
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,073
I want to help them, but...

294
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:31,243
How do you think we should help them?

295
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,718
Let's buy their restaurant.

296
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:43,188
Yeah, we can.

297
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:47,292
But they love traveling so much.
I got an idea.

298
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:50,329
What wicked idea is it?

299
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,865
"Wicked idea"? It's a good idea.

300
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:57,202
I think we should give them
a breakfast van.

301
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:00,739
A breakfast van?

302
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:04,209
They can go on traveling
while doing their business.

303
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,615
Sounds good to me.

304
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:15,354
Right. You haven't told me
what you and Shancai did for fun today?

305
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,623
Nothing fun.

306
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,691
What's fun with managing a warehouse?

307
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:21,793
Shancai is full of fun.

308
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,262
Anything will be fun with her.

309
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:32,938
Yesha.

310
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:36,041
Did Shancai tell you something?

311
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:40,379
Something about what?

312
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:42,914
What should she tell me?

313
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:49,621
No, I mean...

314
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:55,627
Why do you have to leave me
after I met Shancai?

315
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,764
It's a coincidence.

316
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:02,334
My dad just found out where I am.

317
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:15,013
Why are you acting so weird?

318
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:16,848
Are you hiding secrets from me?

319
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:19,051
Me?

320
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:21,019
No.

321
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:22,954
You're insane.

322
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:25,557
This is pretty delicious.

323
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,626
-Is it?
-Yeah.

324
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:31,063
I think you should get closer
with Shancai.

325
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:34,299
Why?

326
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,804
Why not? You socialize with your friends.

327
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:45,811
I think you know my old friends
like Meizuo and Lei.

328
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:49,281
Ximen will be having
a celebration party tomorrow.

329
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:50,816
I'll introduce you to them, okay?

330
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:53,618
That's a taro.

331
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:54,986
It's very delicious.

332
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:57,155
Hey, you haven't given me your answer.

333
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:01,860
What?

334
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:02,961
What do you mean?

335
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,465
You didn't say yes.

336
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:08,266
Yes.

337
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,035
You're so mean.

338
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:41,733
XIMEN
ANSWER?

339
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:45,971
Hi, Ximen.

340
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:48,607
Yeah, I just finished overtime work.

341
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:51,143
A celebration party?

342
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:53,445
You mean tomorrow night?

343
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:54,679
Okay.

344
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,181
Where is it?

345
00:31:58,383 --> 00:31:59,251
Okay.

346
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,954
Okay, bye-bye.

347
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:59,778
GOOD NIGHT! AH XING

348
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:25,437
-Good morning, Miss Yesha.
-Good morning, Miss Yesha.

349
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:29,908
What are those?

350
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:33,278
These are the clothes and shoes
madam wanted to give you.

351
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:49,528
Yesha.

352
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:53,598
The driver will pick you up
this afternoon to meet us.

353
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:58,370
Ah Si's friend, Ximen,
will have a celebration party tonight.

354
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:01,172
Do I have to go?

355
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:05,443
Ximen is a childhood friend of Ah Si.

356
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:09,114
He has achieved great results
very early in his career.

357
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,583
You're Ah Si's fiancée.

358
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:14,052
I think it's necessary that you're there.

359
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,155
Ah Si is the one who should be there.

360
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:18,857
Ximen is his friend, after all.

361
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,892
Correct.

362
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:25,564
However, I think people
will be looking for Ah Si's fiancée.

363
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:30,368
A newly engaged couple
should be inseparable, right?

364
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:36,808
It's courtesy especially in a celebration.

365
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:43,448
Then I'll wait for the driver here.

366
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:46,785
Very good.

367
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:51,890
I heard Shancai is doing well at work.

368
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:01,132
Scary old hag.

369
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,246
There's no reason. I just don't want to.

370
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,615
Are you uncomfortable?

371
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:17,582
No.

372
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,751
Or are you mad at my mom?

373
00:35:19,818 --> 00:35:20,652
No.

374
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:21,553
Then...

375
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,322
I just don't want to,
don't intend to, don't like to.

376
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:29,394
Don't you want to meet my new friends?

377
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:34,132
They're your friends.
Why should I meet them?

378
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,167
Yesha.

379
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,237
Are you the real Yesha?

380
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,574
Why do I have the feeling
that I don't know you anymore?

381
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:47,412
Then get to know me now.

382
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:49,447
I'm Yesha.

383
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:53,918
Arrogant, selfish, hates being restricted,

384
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:56,287
changes constantly every second,

385
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:58,056
Princess of the Kingdom of Bhutan.

386
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,659
No, you're not.
You're not that Yesha in that loft.

387
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,061
Wake up, Daoming Si.

388
00:36:04,062 --> 00:36:05,530
The truth is right in front of you.

389
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:15,006
If you hate being restricted so much,
then why did you get engaged to me?

390
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:21,546
It's because you love me.

391
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:27,686
I need a man who will love me
and obey me completely.

392
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:42,500
Yesha.

393
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:43,968
Shancai.

394
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,441
We're friends, right?

395
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,776
Please do me a favor.

396
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:53,111
Leave me alone.

397
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,049
<i>If you hate being restricted so much,</i>

398
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:33,418
<i>then why did you get engaged to me?</i>

399
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,187
<i>It's because you love me.</i>

400
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:42,494
<i>I need a man who will love me
and obey me completely.</i>

401
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:46,865
<i>Yesha doesn't love Daoming Si.</i>

402
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,035
<i>This engagement is a contract.</i>

403
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:55,140
<i>Daoming Si is the only one
who has been kept in the dark.</i>

404
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,543
<i>Should I tell Daoming Si?</i>

405
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:02,180
<i>No. He won't be able to accept the truth.</i>

406
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:04,682
<i>But he...</i>

407
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:17,262
Daoming Si.

408
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,581
Is the manager here?

409
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:39,184
He was just here a while ago.

410
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,885
I don't know where he is now.

411
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,654
Oh, thank you.

412
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:55,967
<i>Unlike me, who's got nothing
to do in my office.</i>

413
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:58,336
I'm either reading a proposal

414
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:01,005
or signing something.

415
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:37,575
What a coincidence. You're here, too.

416
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:44,582
Actually, it's not a coincidence.

417
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:47,485
I was looking for you.

418
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,189
What's the matter?

419
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:53,258
Nothing.

420
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:57,428
I'm just... worried about you.

421
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:04,002
One needs someone to vent to
when they're troubled.

422
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:07,872
You can vent to me if you like.

423
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:13,144
Thank you.

424
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:15,680
Don't bother.

425
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:23,388
Well... I'll leave you to it
if you don't need me.

426
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:33,131
It won't help you
if you hide everything in your heart.

427
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:38,770
If you don't want to share it with me,
you can yell it to the skies,

428
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:40,438
shout whatever you like.

429
00:40:40,972 --> 00:40:43,241
This will help you feel better
than thinking too much about it.

430
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:46,144
It's true.

431
00:40:46,311 --> 00:40:48,446
When you teased me back at school,

432
00:40:48,513 --> 00:40:50,481
I would run to the rooftop
to shout back at you.

433
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:52,350
You can try it.

434
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:56,854
Shancai.

435
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,660
Did Yesha tell you anything
about her "mission"?

436
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:05,530
Mission?

437
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,267
I don't think so.

438
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:16,374
Yesha changed.

439
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:19,811
She really did.

440
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:24,816
I don't know what to do, either.

441
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,219
Maybe I'm being selfish to ask you this.

442
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:30,121
-But I--
-Please don't.

443
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:32,857
I'm happy to share your problems.

444
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:39,864
Do you really want my opinion?

445
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:42,967
Daoming Si.

446
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:45,536
I think you should trust yourself.

447
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:49,540
Trust myself?

448
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,176
I trusted myself,

449
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,278
and that's how I found out
Yesha doesn't love me anymore.

450
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:55,613
That's not how it works.

451
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,182
You should believe that you are worthy
of being loved by Yesha.

452
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:03,788
It's true that you love Yesha.

453
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:06,391
Even if Yesha doesn't love you anymore,

454
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:08,726
instead of making her love you again,

455
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:11,195
you keep wondering
why doesn't she love you.

456
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:13,464
Don't you think it's stupid?

457
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:21,806
Who taught you all these?

458
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:23,808
You.

459
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,878
I was really annoyed with you.

460
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:32,683
I kept rejecting your kindness
when I knew you'd done a lot for me.

461
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:37,255
Every time I thought you would give up,

462
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:38,823
you didn't.

463
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:43,327
You were about to go crazy because of me.

464
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:46,397
But you never gave up.

465
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:49,600
You even said,

466
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:53,371
no matter where I am,

467
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:55,973
you will go after me.

468
00:42:57,608 --> 00:42:59,077
Even if I'm in hell,

469
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:01,679
you'll get me.

470
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,486
I'm sorry.

471
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,688
I shouldn't keep talking about the past.

472
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,131
I hurt you.

473
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:24,602
I left everything in our past
for you to bear alone.

474
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,274
Why are you so nice to me?

475
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:35,780
Because...

476
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:38,182
I hope you can be happy.

477
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,370
Maybe I'll never know
how many times I made you cry.

478
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,540
However,

479
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:05,009
all I can say is...

480
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:08,012
thank you...

481
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,214
Shancai.

482
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:15,520
Thank you for accepting the new me.

483
00:44:17,922 --> 00:44:19,257
You're welcome.

484
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:57,248
