1
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:05,058
This is the only chance
I'm giving Shancai.

2
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:07,194
You should know that.

3
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:09,830
With her background,

4
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,734
she can never be a part
of the Daoming family.

5
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,005
But if you agree to be engaged to Ah Si,

6
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:21,274
of course, which will only be in name,

7
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:25,379
I will allow Shancai to meet with Ah Si.

8
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:29,516
In that way, I can get what I want,

9
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:32,953
and Shancai might get what she wants.

10
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:35,255
Of course,

11
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,424
the royal family of your country, too.

12
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:40,494
What do you mean?

13
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,696
The financial trouble
that your country's royal family

14
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:45,766
is experiencing is not a secret anymore.

15
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,203
I believe that your father
and your country's king

16
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,674
would be willing to cooperate
with the Daoming Corporation.

17
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:54,975
Am I right?

18
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,411
What if I still don't agree?

19
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:00,380
Then Shancai has no hope
of seeing Ah Si in this lifetime.

20
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,554
Take your time, Miss Yesha.

21
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,690
Consider the deal carefully.

22
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,426
Let's see if you can bear

23
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,461
being a disrespectful daughter
to your father

24
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:19,833
or personally crush
Shancai's last hope for happiness.

25
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,168
Three months.

26
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,438
I'll give you three months.

27
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:27,974
After three months,
I'll end the engagement

28
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,910
and you'll let him and Shancai
be together.

29
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,180
I can't promise you that.

30
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,016
The only thing I can give Shancai
is a chance.

31
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,019
Whether or not they'll end up together
depends on Ah Si.

32
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:43,356
You can at least arrange for them
to be together every day.

33
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,860
Then you also have to promise me

34
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:49,696
that you won't leave the Daoming household
for three months,

35
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:53,467
and you won't tell anyone
what we discussed today.

36
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,202
Don't worry.

37
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:59,139
It's not good to tell anyone
about schemes like this

38
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,475
that play with people's feelings.

39
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:06,313
Can I leave now, Mrs. Daoming?

40
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:12,586
Please take Miss Yesha to her bedroom
so she can get some rest.

41
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:13,553
Yes.

42
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:26,900
Now I understand why Ah Si
doesn't want to come home.

43
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:33,073
It's because his happiness
is just a tool for his selfish mother

44
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,809
to chase after power and material things.

45
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:41,114
I'm glad to work with you,

46
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:42,816
Your Highness Princess Yesha.

47
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:56,997
Madam, three months might not be enough.

48
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,701
I might not be able to increase
the Daoming family's prestige

49
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,737
in three months.

50
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:08,909
However, that's more than enough time
for Ah Si and Yesha

51
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,711
to get married.

52
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,382
Miss Yesha might not agree with that.

53
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:16,550
She will

54
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:19,252
because she has fallen in love with Ah Si.

55
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,088
She probably didn't realize

56
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,591
that the words she used
to insult me earlier

57
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,960
revealed her true feelings instead.

58
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:34,134
So, Madam, you're just using Shancai
to give Miss Yesha the runaround.

59
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,437
It's doesn't matter whether Ah Si
will have a change of heart or not.

60
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,273
A weed will always be just a weed.

61
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,176
It can only be trampled on by people.

62
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,903
-Qinghe, please sit down.
-Okay.

63
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,215
Are you hungry?

64
00:06:55,615 --> 00:07:00,487
I made tuna sandwiches,
jelly, and double-sized salads,

65
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:01,988
and chocolate cake.

66
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:03,523
What do you want to have first?

67
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:07,027
You made these yourself?

68
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,362
That's right. Please try it.

69
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:12,098
If you don't like it,
I'll try to improve next time.

70
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:15,001
No, it's fine.

71
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,007
I'll try this first.

72
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:22,742
Okay, please enjoy.

73
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:33,420
-It tastes really good.
-Really?

74
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,557
It's even better with this.

75
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,194
-I usually eat it this way.
-I see.

76
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:54,941
Can I have one more?

77
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,878
If you like it,
I can prepare them for you every day.

78
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,647
That's great. You should have some, too.

79
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:01,781
Okay, Qinghe.

80
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,759
Why is there water falling?

81
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:18,598
Qinghe, is it going to rain soon?

82
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:19,799
That's impossible.

83
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,768
The weather forecast
said it won't rain today.

84
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,343
Qinghe, it's raining.

85
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:39,019
Why kind of place is this?

86
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,820
There's nowhere to hide from the rain.

87
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,490
Yeah, that's right.

88
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:47,427
Oh, no. I'm soaked inside and out.

89
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:48,461
What should we do?

90
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:50,830
How would I know?

91
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,866
I'm soaked inside and out, too.

92
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,142
Qinghe, should we find a place

93
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,845
where we can change out
of these wet clothes?

94
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,147
You're right.

95
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,716
We should find a place
to take off our clothes.

96
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,153
Find a place to take off our clothes?

97
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,022
Let's go.

98
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:50,490
Why do you keep looking at me like that?

99
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:52,425
Qinghe.

100
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,128
I'm so touched.

101
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,532
Why would you be touched
when you got drenched all over?

102
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:01,868
My dad said

103
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,470
that a man who can resist temptation

104
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,338
and not afraid of disasters

105
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,774
is definitely a good and trustworthy man.

106
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,676
Qinghe.

107
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,911
After what happened earlier,

108
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:15,748
I can confirm
that you really are a good man.

109
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:19,886
Unafraid of disasters?

110
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,821
I guess so.

111
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,524
But where is the temptation?

112
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,102
You lost your memory?

113
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:41,774
That's why people call Ah Xing,
Daoming Si, and Young Master.

114
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:46,246
But what should we call you from now on?

115
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,451
Whatever name you choose to call me,

116
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,319
I'm still me.

117
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:00,660
However,

118
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:05,498
will you return to your original life

119
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,568
after your mother finds Yesha?

120
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,074
No matter where I am,

121
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,912
we'll always be friends.

122
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,755
Young Master.

123
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:31,291
What?

124
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,726
Madam asked me to take you home.

125
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,863
There's no need.

126
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,298
I'll go home when it's time.

127
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,265
Young Master.

128
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:43,203
Let me tell you

129
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,239
that Madam and Miss Yesha
are waiting for you at home.

130
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:36,990
Yesha.

131
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:39,959
My mom found you.

132
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:42,061
She didn't lie. She really found you.

133
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:44,230
Ah Si.

134
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:47,033
You're finally home.

135
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:49,469
I should thank you.

136
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:53,172
You're really good.

137
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,208
Like I said,

138
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,243
I won't let you down.

139
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:01,981
I'm also giving you a gift
to welcome you back.

140
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:03,449
There's no need.

141
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,287
I don't need anything.

142
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:09,956
Except for an engagement ceremony.

143
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,258
What did you say?

144
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:13,326
I'm sorry.

145
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:17,964
I didn't get your permission first
before proposing to Yesha on your behalf.

146
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,534
However, I think
you won't blame me for that

147
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,403
because Yesha already agreed.

148
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,842
I think I'll let Yesha answer

149
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,578
all your questions.

150
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,982
I still have to prepare
for your engagement.

151
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:39,052
Since the Daoming family
and the Bhutan royal family

152
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,620
are going to be in-laws,

153
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:44,724
this engagement ceremony can't be shabby.

154
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,193
Right, Yesha?

155
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:56,369
Madam.

156
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,506
Watch them carefully.

157
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,142
Especially Yesha.

158
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,780
I won't allow anything to happen
before the engagement ceremony.

159
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,482
-Got it?
-Yes.

160
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:15,688
Yesha.

161
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,257
What exactly is going on?

162
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,126
Why did my mom say that you're...

163
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:21,928
I'm sorry, Ah Si.

164
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:23,496
I lied to you.

165
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:31,037
The current king of Bhutan
is my father's brother,

166
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:33,206
my uncle.

167
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:37,577
I grew up under the rules
of the royal family.

168
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:41,447
I've also been asked to portray
the role of a princess.

169
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:44,117
I hate such pretenses,

170
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,220
and I hate even more
the restrictions that come with it.

171
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:49,856
So, two years ago,

172
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:51,724
I ran away from home,

173
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:55,862
hoping to explore the world
as my real self.

174
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,335
That's why you never mentioned your family

175
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,606
and you hate being forced to do things.

176
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,146
That's why you like to leave
without saying goodbye.

177
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,283
You also don't want anyone
to know your identity.

178
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,486
Only Sha knows.

179
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,491
He knows everything about me.

180
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:29,262
In that case,

181
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,231
you shouldn't have come back.

182
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,967
Even if my mother found you...

183
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,075
She forced you to stay, right?

184
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:48,681
In order to get me to come home,

185
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,851
she forced you to marry me, right?

186
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:54,687
Right?

187
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,857
She did threaten me.

188
00:15:58,424 --> 00:15:59,992
She used you to threaten me.

189
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:03,729
Me?

190
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:07,500
You still don't get it, silly boy?

191
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,436
She threatened to ruin your happiness.

192
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,205
Tell me.

193
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,606
How could I not agree?

194
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:25,351
It has been one day and one night.

195
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:29,622
Yesha, where exactly did you go?

196
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,895
Where else can I go to find you?

197
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,591
Welcome.

198
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,393
Excuse me, miss.

199
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,030
Do you have another part-time worker
aside from you?

200
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:13,733
You mean Shancai?

201
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,668
Yes, where is she?

202
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,104
Shancai already left.

203
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,539
She left?

204
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:22,642
Do you have her contact number
or address then?

205
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,279
Please. I really need to find her.

206
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,017
Please.

207
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,387
I'm coming.

208
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,821
All right.

209
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,491
All right. Who is it?

210
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:43,162
Stop ringing the bell!

211
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,364
Do you think that electricity is free?

212
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,568
All right. I'm coming!

213
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:00,379
May I ask if Shancai is home?

214
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,283
She's not home yet.

215
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:06,619
Who are you?

216
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,721
I'm her friend.

217
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,389
May I ask where she went?

218
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:17,797
She went on a date with her boyfriend.

219
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:50,129
Are you that stupid girl
who was dumped by Daoming Si?

220
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:57,670
Look at your silly, crybaby face.

221
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,605
How can you compare with Yesha?

222
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:00,940
Of course he doesn't want you.

223
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,344
Why? You think it's unfair?

224
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:07,113
Hit me then.

225
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,214
Come and hit me.

226
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:09,782
Come and hit me!

227
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:14,286
Are you okay, miss?

228
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,722
Why? Do you want to hit me, too?

229
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:19,025
Please help me. Hit me.

230
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,928
<i>Everyone thinks I'm crazy, right?</i>

231
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,831
<i>Actually, I hope I'm really crazy.</i>

232
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:29,368
<i>That way, my mind won't be
as clear as it is now.</i>

233
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:33,873
<i>And I won't feel
how painful it is right now.</i>

234
00:19:58,898 --> 00:19:59,932
<i>What should I do?</i>

235
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:04,637
<i>Mom and Dad must be waiting for me at home
to hear about my good news.</i>

236
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:09,041
<i>However, if I don't go home,
where else can I go?</i>

237
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,135
<i>Never mind. I shouldn't look for Lei.</i>

238
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,704
<i>I shouldn't dump my sadness on Lei.</i>

239
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,790
HUAZE LEI

240
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:14,707
No wonder.

241
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:17,476
What?

242
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,981
Don't people always say
that reunions happen during the full moon?

243
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,384
I shouldn't have asked him
to come out today.

244
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:30,556
Shancai.

245
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:34,326
Cry if you want to.

246
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,564
Why aren't you telling me
to do a handstand?

247
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,768
-If you want to do a handstand, you--
-I don't.

248
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:44,336
I don't want to cry.

249
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,340
I'm already sick and tired of crying.

250
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,409
I already hate myself for crying so much.

251
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:53,112
I won't cry anymore.

252
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,681
Crying is useless.

253
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:57,349
It's totally useless.

254
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,190
Shancai.

255
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:08,994
Ah Si is like a scattered puzzle.

256
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,164
The number of pieces is the same,

257
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:16,101
but it needs to be put together
in a different way.

258
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:18,170
Please, Lei.

259
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,874
I don't want to hear any analysis
about Daoming Si anymore.

260
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:25,744
I'm not the one who scattered the puzzle.

261
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,013
I'm also not the one
putting the puzzle together now.

262
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,716
Nobody even asked me

263
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:32,718
how the puzzle
originally looked like, right?

264
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,555
So, now,

265
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:38,924
can you let me do something
that's not related to puzzles?

266
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:42,862
What do you want to do?

267
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:45,731
Anything.

268
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,735
Lei, let's go bowling, okay?

269
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,239
Why?

270
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:55,541
You don't even know how to do it.

271
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:58,210
That's why I want to learn it.

272
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,614
Let's go. You're responsible
for teaching me today.

273
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,549
I want to play until I get strikes.

274
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:04,817
-Let's go.
-I'm not going.

275
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,486
-I don't care. Let's go.
-Shancai.

276
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,022
You're not good at bowling.

277
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:11,290
So what if I'm not good at it?

278
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:12,758
Should I give up just because of that?

279
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:14,660
Why is everyone telling me to give up?

280
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,028
I'm still working hard on it.

281
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:19,465
I'm working really hard.
Why won't you give me a chance?

282
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,250
I'm not telling you to give up.

283
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:45,691
If this love has not ended yet,
then you must not give up.

284
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:56,035
I can't do it anymore.

285
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,271
I don't have any strength left.

286
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:03,242
I've reached the end of the road.

287
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:05,744
I can't go any further.

288
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:14,853
I'll go with you.

289
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:18,357
Why would you go with me?

290
00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:20,759
I'm a burden and I'm troublesome.
I've been dragging you all along.

291
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:27,066
You actually can't go
any further too, right?

292
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,636
You know how to comfort me.
You know me best.

293
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,839
However, you just stayed there
and said nothing today.

294
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,208
That's because you also
can't go any further, right?

295
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:48,253
Where are you taking me?

296
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,321
Lei.

297
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,403
Where are you taking me?

298
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:07,206
Lei.

299
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,776
Didn't you say you've reached
the end of the road?

300
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,178
We're going to the end of the road now.

301
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:15,214
What do you mean?

302
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:18,751
This is a long road,
and it's very straight.

303
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,286
I won't drive fast,

304
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,655
but I'm not going to step
on the brakes either.

305
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,425
Unless you tell me to stop,

306
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:27,993
we'll reach the end of the road.

307
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,361
Are you insane?

308
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:31,263
This is extremely dangerous, you know?

309
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,299
What if we crash into a mountain
or fall off a cliff?

310
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,502
We will die. Don't you know that?

311
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:03,929
What are you doing?

312
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,306
I get it now.

313
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:16,975
I haven't had enough.

314
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:19,211
I can still call for help,

315
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:22,181
so I haven't reached the end yet.

316
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,552
So, Lei...

317
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,388
Stop.

318
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:55,247
Shancai.

319
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,650
Do you know what that black part
behind the lights is?

320
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,420
It should be a mountain.

321
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:03,755
What's behind that mountain then?

322
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,692
I don't know. I'm not good at geography.

323
00:27:08,894 --> 00:27:11,063
Actually, it should be lights, right?

324
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:12,865
You're right.

325
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:21,540
Lei.

326
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,342
I've confirmed something.

327
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:25,677
What?

328
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,414
Even though I have no idea
what the end of the road looks like,

329
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:31,817
I'm sure

330
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:33,819
that if I get there,

331
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,221
you'll also be with me.

332
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,328
You know what, Lei?

333
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,064
Tonight,

334
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,933
I really just want to get a good sleep.

335
00:28:07,386 --> 00:28:08,654
That's so funny.

336
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,859
Right? What's happening now?

337
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:16,728
Look at that guy with a cap.
He's so funny.

338
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:18,263
I love watching him the most.

339
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,465
He just looks so silly.

340
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,533
He's so dumb.

341
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:23,902
Excuse me.

342
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:26,205
Excuse me. When will Shancai be back?

343
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:27,372
I don't know.

344
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:29,174
-Look!
-You don't know.

345
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:32,077
It's so late.

346
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,279
That's right.

347
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:35,614
Honey, it's so late.

348
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:38,884
Shancai's not home yet.

349
00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:40,719
That means...

350
00:28:40,786 --> 00:28:43,455
She won't be coming home tonight.

351
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:48,527
What kind of parents are you?

352
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:50,229
Why are you so happy

353
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:52,297
that your daughter
is not coming home for the night?

354
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:54,900
Let me tell you.

355
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:58,870
It means that things
with Shancai and Master Ah Si

356
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,739
-are going well tonight.
-Are going well tonight.

357
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,775
-Congratulations, Honey.
-Congratulations.

358
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:05,043
I'm going to get a glass of water.

359
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,178
Great.

360
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,185
Do you know where they are?

361
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,321
Do you know?

362
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:19,124
I only know that you should
let go of my wife's hand.

363
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:20,959
Your face looks like a mahjong tile.

364
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:23,595
I'm watching TV. Get up.

365
00:29:23,662 --> 00:29:26,531
-Why are you on my seat?
-I really need to see Shancai urgently.

366
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,699
Get up.

367
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:34,039
You keep saying it's urgent.

368
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,074
What's so urgent?

369
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,277
You won't tell us.

370
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:41,747
-Sha.
-Yes?

371
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,115
Remember, you can't...

372
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,851
Let Shancai and the others know
you're still in Taiwan.

373
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,454
You already reminded me
for about 1,800 times.

374
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,194
Sir.

375
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:58,563
Please be reasonable.

376
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:02,401
How can we watch television
when you're sitting there?

377
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:11,943
Tell us what it is first.

378
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:16,715
We'll see how urgent it is
so that we can decide

379
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:19,685
if we should call and interrupt Shancai.

380
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:20,919
-Right.
-Call?

381
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,688
Shancai has a mobile phone?

382
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,693
I think this guy came from another planet.

383
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:31,596
Don't you know there's such a thing
as a "mobile phone" now?

384
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,833
I'm so stupid.

385
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:37,269
How can I not think of that?

386
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:41,206
Can you tell me
Shancai's mobile number then?

387
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:42,841
Please give me Shancai's number, okay?

388
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:45,277
Calm down. Why should I tell you?

389
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,846
We already let you into our house

390
00:30:47,913 --> 00:30:49,881
and watch television
while waiting for Shancai.

391
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:51,516
We're already very hospitable.

392
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,919
-Exactly.
-Don't push your luck, okay?

393
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,555
That' ridiculous.

394
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:05,230
I want her phone number!

395
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,871
-Honey.
-Yes?

396
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:15,374
I think this guy is really weird.

397
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,745
He said he knows Shancai
and Master Ah Si, too.

398
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,747
However, we haven't heard
anything about him

399
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,615
-from Shancai.
-That's right.

400
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:26,685
Does he have any ulterior motives?

401
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:28,787
Let me tell you.

402
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:30,522
He looks ferocious.

403
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:32,124
He's not a nice person.

404
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,926
Listen up, you two fatties!

405
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:38,830
I want her phone number!

406
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,310
Believe me. I'm not a bad person.

407
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,679
I don't mean any harm.

408
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:16,034
Give me Shancai's phone number.

409
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,177
I'm begging you.

410
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,848
Please give me Shancai's phone number.

411
00:32:29,915 --> 00:32:31,183
I'm begging you.

412
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,155
Please, I'm begging you.

413
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:39,224
Give me Shancai's number.

414
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:11,316
You're back.

415
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,751
You're back!

416
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,520
You're finally back now.

417
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:18,356
Do you know how many mosquitos I killed

418
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:21,126
while waiting by your door
the whole night?

419
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:23,929
It's you.

420
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,064
How did you know where I live?

421
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:27,966
Shancai, who is he?

422
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:29,734
I should be asking you that.

423
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:33,138
Do you know that I've been waiting
by your door the whole night?

424
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:34,940
I was waiting the whole night.

425
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,841
In the end, you weren't with your love.

426
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:41,846
Aren't you on a date with Ah Si?
Why are you with this guy?

427
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,049
Who are you?

428
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:45,984
What are you talking about?

429
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:47,819
How do you know Ah Si?

430
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:51,890
Of course I know him.

431
00:34:51,957 --> 00:34:55,627
Shancai, why are you with Lei?

432
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,228
Who is Lei?

433
00:34:57,996 --> 00:34:59,497
Why are you still here?

434
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:02,167
Dad, you know him?

435
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:05,003
How would I know him?
Isn't he your friend?

436
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:07,205
I don't know him.

437
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:08,707
I've never met him before.

438
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:15,313
You said you know Ah Si.

439
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:17,582
What?

440
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:18,750
Is that true?

441
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:21,019
Tell me. Who are you?

442
00:35:21,086 --> 00:35:22,120
What is your name?

443
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:23,655
Who exactly are you?

444
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,490
Actually...

445
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:27,692
Actually, I'm Yesha's friend.

446
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,195
Yesha?

447
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:32,464
Shancai.

448
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:35,367
Yesha is missing.

449
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:41,906
Ah Xing!

450
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,009
Yesha!

451
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,243
Ah Xing!

452
00:35:46,378 --> 00:35:48,546
-Daoming Si!
-Yesha!

453
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,016
It's impossible
not to hear our loud voices.

454
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,351
Ah Xing!

455
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,667
There's a fortune teller here.
I should let her tell my future first.

456
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,168
Don't worry, Sha.

457
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:13,371
Maybe Yesha just...

458
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:14,806
Let's go back first.

459
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:16,374
Maybe Yesha's already home.

460
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:17,609
That's right.

461
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:23,548
<i>We're at the press conference
of Daoming Corporation.</i>

462
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:24,549
<i>Based on what we know,</i>

463
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:27,452
<i>the president of Daoming Corporation
will be announcing news</i>

464
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,222
<i>regarding the engagement
of their only son, Mr. Daoming Si,</i>

465
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:35,293
<i>and a member of the Bhutan royal family,
Princess Yesha.</i>

466
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:04,255
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
the president of Daoming Corporation,

467
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:05,790
Daoming Feng. Thank you.

468
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:20,105
To all the press here,

469
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:23,675
thank you for finding time

470
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:26,444
to come here amidst your busy schedule.

471
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:31,382
I'm formally announcing
that my beloved son, Daoming Si,

472
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:35,620
would become the third successor
of Daoming Corporation.

473
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:44,028
Aside from this,

474
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:46,631
as a mother,

475
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:48,566
I'm more excited

476
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:52,270
to announce good news to everyone.

477
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:55,607
My son, Daoming Si,

478
00:37:56,641 --> 00:38:02,013
and the youngest daughter
of Prince Zuomeng, Princess Yesha,

479
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:04,582
will be married soon.

480
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:08,853
Please welcome my future daughter-in-law,

481
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,356
Princess Yesha.

482
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:30,441
Thank you.

483
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:43,988
That's impossible.

484
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:45,857
This is impossible.

485
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:50,195
Yesha was supposed to travel with me.

486
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:53,832
Why would she get engaged to Ah Xing?

487
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,503
It's also impossible for her
to reveal her identity.

488
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,805
This is too strange.

489
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:02,807
This is too ridiculous. This...

490
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,210
This is impossible.

491
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:06,144
Shancai.

492
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,849
We've been looking for so long.

493
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:14,352
It turns out Yesha went on television
to be engaged with Daoming Si.

494
00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:15,787
No, Shancai.

495
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:18,122
Actually, Yesha, she has always...

496
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,225
She...

497
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,192
Oh, gosh.

498
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,428
I don't know how to explain it
to you anymore.

499
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:24,696
There's no need to explain.

500
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,631
This is already a fact.

501
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,268
No, Yesha...

502
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:32,170
Oh, gosh.

503
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:39,344
Meizuo.

504
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,279
<i>Did you see the news, Lei?</i>

505
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:42,380
Engaged?

506
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:46,951
Okay, understood.
I'll be there right away.

507
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,402
Why are you all looking at me that way?

508
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:05,837
It's like I'm a victim.

509
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:06,905
Shancai.

510
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:08,873
I'm not a victim.

511
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,076
I've just been tricked.

512
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:14,579
I've been tricked by a car accident.

513
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:16,514
I've been tricked by a mishap.

514
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:19,217
In the end, even my friend...

515
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:23,655
Shancai.

516
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:25,490
You can't blame Yesha.

517
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:27,825
I know I shouldn't blame Yesha

518
00:40:28,326 --> 00:40:29,794
because she's the one Daoming Si loves.

519
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:31,996
I don't have the right to blame her.

520
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:34,599
I just don't understand.

521
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,935
She told me she's leaving Taiwan.

522
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:39,070
Why is she getting engaged
to Daoming Si today?

523
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:41,506
She really meant to leave Taiwan.

524
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:44,976
She didn't get to leave for a reason.

525
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:47,979
Sha.

526
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:49,347
What is the reason?

527
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:50,715
It's...

528
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,019
Tell us, Sha.

529
00:40:57,255 --> 00:40:58,323
I met her before.

530
00:40:59,324 --> 00:41:00,558
I met that Yesha before.

531
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:02,961
What's going on?

532
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:05,430
When I saw the news earlier,

533
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:07,699
I thought that the princess
looked familiar.

534
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,101
I finally remember now.

535
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:14,739
Before meeting Ah Si, she told me
she studied in Yingde University

536
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,407
and she kept asking
for information about us.

537
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,511
She must have approached me intentionally.

538
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:23,381
Stop making assumptions.

539
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:25,783
Yesha is a princess.

540
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,452
Why would she approach you intentionally?

541
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,621
She must have wanted to help Ah Xing

542
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:31,856
get back his memories.

543
00:41:32,357 --> 00:41:33,791
Then why did she approach Shancai?

544
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:34,892
She...

545
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:35,860
Tell me.

546
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,329
I don't know.

547
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:40,465
Anyway, I'm sure Yesha
is not that kind of person.

548
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:43,034
The truth is in front of us.

549
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,169
She really did lie to Shancai.

550
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:46,304
She...

551
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:47,572
Sha is right.

552
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:49,941
The Yesha that I know
is not that kind of person.

553
00:41:50,475 --> 00:41:51,476
That's right.

554
00:41:52,143 --> 00:41:53,811
It's not that simple.

555
00:41:54,212 --> 00:41:55,880
Think about it.

556
00:41:56,748 --> 00:41:58,216
Based on Yesha's status,

557
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:01,486
isn't it easy to marry
a simple-minded person like Ah Xing?

558
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:05,289
Why would she waste her efforts
just to trick Shancai?

559
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,291
That's right.

560
00:42:08,493 --> 00:42:10,094
She's a princess from Bhutan.

561
00:42:12,964 --> 00:42:14,899
The Empress Dowager
surely wouldn't miss the opportunity

562
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,201
to become a royal family in-law.

563
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,638
She's literally the empress dowager now.

564
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,783
What's the matter, Yesha?

565
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:34,018
Are you all right?

566
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:35,987
I'm fine.

567
00:42:36,454 --> 00:42:38,556
I just hate answering
those boring questions.

568
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:41,859
Don't mind me. Go and greet the press.

569
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:44,629
No, I want to stay here with you.

570
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:46,964
I'm fine, really.

571
00:42:49,434 --> 00:42:51,903
It's awkward to deal with the press.
I don't want to go.

572
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,108
You're the successor
of Daoming Corporation.

573
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:59,710
You have to get used to these things.

574
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,616
You're my fiancée. Why shouldn't you
get used to these things then?

575
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:07,718
Because I want to be alone.

576
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:10,555
What exactly is going on, Yesha?

577
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,157
Nothing.

578
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:15,893
Don't bother me, okay?

579
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:19,063
I just want to know why you're unhappy.

580
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,365
I'm not.

581
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,500
Yesha.

582
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:24,235
Ah Si.

583
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:30,041
Yesha has been busy the whole day.

584
00:43:30,408 --> 00:43:33,044
She probably couldn't sleep last night
because she was too nervous.

585
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:36,114
Let her get some rest.

586
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,450
That's right.

587
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:43,654
Do you want me to regret
our engagement on the very first day?

588
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:45,623
Ah Si.

589
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:49,293
If you don't learn
how to be a good husband

590
00:43:50,161 --> 00:43:53,664
and manage the company well,

591
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:57,301
how can you make Yesha happy?

592
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,172
When the time comes,

593
00:44:02,173 --> 00:44:04,242
I might not be able to keep

594
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:08,146
a good daughter-in-law like Yesha
no matter how good I am.

595
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:11,649
Exactly.

596
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,452
Ah Si knows very well

597
00:44:15,353 --> 00:44:17,221
how bad my temper is.

598
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:22,193
If people don't fulfill
their promises to me,

599
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,795
I won't let them off easily.

600
00:44:25,463 --> 00:44:26,531
Right, Ah Si?

601
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:28,199
Okay.

602
00:44:28,266 --> 00:44:31,335
I'll go and deal
with those reporters, okay?

603
00:44:51,756 --> 00:44:52,857
Yutian.

604
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,526
Contact Shancai now.

605
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,815
