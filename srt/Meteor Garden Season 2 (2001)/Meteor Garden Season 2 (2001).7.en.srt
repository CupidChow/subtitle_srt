1
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:10,030
Why are we going to the library?

2
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,368
Like Zhongze said,

3
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,204
if our family business in Taiwan
is that big,

4
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:21,208
we can find something about my family

5
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:24,544
by searching through
all the newspapers and magazines.

6
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:26,380
Maybe,

7
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:28,882
this can make me remember something.

8
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,755
I know this isn't a smart idea, but...

9
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,491
You know, I can't expose who I am,

10
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:42,062
and I can't let my family know I'm looking
for them. It's a hard thing to do.

11
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,430
Yes.

12
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:47,000
I mean, you can't just grab someone,

13
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:49,436
and then ask, "Do you know where
the Daoming family is?"

14
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:51,271
Why not?

15
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:52,572
The problem is...

16
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:54,274
Young lady.

17
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,877
Excuse me. Do you know where
the Daoming family is?

18
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,545
-The Daoming family?
-Yes.

19
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,047
Of course, I know.

20
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:02,883
Who doesn't know the Daoming Family?

21
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,086
What?

22
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,688
Where is the Daoming Family?

23
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,856
They own many corporations in Taiwan.

24
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:13,293
So many. Like everywhere.

25
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,796
-Yeah.
-Really?

26
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,030
So...

27
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,666
So where is it? You didn't tell me.

28
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,835
Do you see that palace-like building?

29
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:23,270
That's run by that family.

30
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,338
You're really weird.

31
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,011
Seriously?

32
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,647
What a coincidence.

33
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,150
Then...

34
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,295
Shall we take a look?

35
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:50,997
No way.

36
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:01,108
-The pillow in the room isn't soft enough.
-Yes, ma'am.

37
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,610
-The fruit basket isn't fresh enough.
-Yes, ma'am.

38
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:06,613
-The room delivery service is sub-par.
-Yes, ma'am.

39
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,182
-The menu needs an update.
-Yes, ma'am.

40
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,819
Useless people have no place
in the Daoming family.

41
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,921
We fire employees who deserve it.

42
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,056
Yes, ma'am.

43
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,758
Of course.

44
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,559
You are included.

45
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,827
Yes, ma'am.

46
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:24,064
So remember the words I just said,
because I won't say them again.

47
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:27,267
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

48
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:32,939
Also,

49
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,143
that's not your dust storage.

50
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,513
-Wipe it clean as soon as possible.
-Yes, ma'am.

51
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,014
I don't know what I'm afraid of.

52
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:18,518
My mother can't be meaner
than the landlady.

53
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,755
Yet I don't know why my feet...

54
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,766
An abnormal stranger.

55
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,771
That's okay if she's just any stranger.

56
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,975
She's a stranger
that should be familiar to you.

57
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,244
That's what you're afraid of.

58
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:53,653
I'll see what I can dig up.

59
00:05:57,324 --> 00:06:00,193
Your mother is our only lead.

60
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,662
However, since you have a huge family,

61
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,898
your mother shouldn't be
your only family member.

62
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:09,202
I believe there must be nice people
in your family.

63
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,215
<i>Your mother is really killing it.</i>

64
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,883
<i>She got tons of work every day.</i>

65
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,720
<i>No matter she's in her office or others',</i>

66
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,356
<i>she is always doing business,</i>

67
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,725
<i>even when she is eating.</i>

68
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,594
<i>She won't eat the dishes she ordered.</i>

69
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,597
<i>When she's free from business and eating,</i>

70
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:12,632
<i>her mouth still won't stop,</i>

71
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,267
<i>because she's scolding people.</i>

72
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,836
<i>Hey, the routine.</i>

73
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,972
<i>My mother's routine is the point, okay?</i>

74
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,742
<i>Speaking of her routine, we got a problem.</i>

75
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:26,212
<i>There are some places
that she visits every day,</i>

76
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,816
<i>like restaurants and offices.</i>

77
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,485
<i>Yet she doesn't have a fixed schedule.</i>

78
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,489
<i>Sometimes she would go straight home,
change her clothes and head out again.</i>

79
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,425
<i>Then, what are we doing here?</i>

80
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,428
<i>Don't worry.</i>

81
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:42,929
<i>I've followed her for days,</i>

82
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:47,167
<i>and I finally get an action window.</i>

83
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:01,314
<i>This is her only fixed routine.</i>

84
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:04,117
<i>The restaurant is her first stop
every day.</i>

85
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,253
<i>After 12 minutes, at 7:57 a.m.,</i>

86
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,189
<i>she arrives at the restaurant.</i>

87
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:14,594
<i>Once she receives the message,
we have 12 minutes before she comes back.</i>

88
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:20,767
Sir.

89
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,770
-Young master.
-Get out of my way.

90
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:29,275
Butler Liu, the young master comes back...

91
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,752
It's strange. How...

92
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,923
Young master. It's indeed you!

93
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,392
You finally come back.

94
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,494
Okay, start timing.

95
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,095
Start...

96
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,744
What's the matter?

97
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:06,746
Hello, ma'am, I'm Butler Liu.

98
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:10,216
Yes. I'm reporting to you that
the young master is back.

99
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,951
He brought a girl with him.

100
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,120
She is not Shancai.

101
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:16,423
She... looks like a foreigner.

102
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:18,558
Listen.

103
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,727
Stop the young master no matter what.

104
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:23,329
Understood. I'll go find him right now.
Understood...

105
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,103
Everyone, assemble!

106
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,605
The young master is back
but he's gone again!

107
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:36,309
Find the young master!

108
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,480
Tell the driver to park the car
at the entrance. Quickly.

109
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,733
There are more up there. Let's go.

110
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:02,869
Quick.

111
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:12,178
Young master...

112
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:15,849
Why don't you tell me
there are so many people?

113
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,450
-How could I know?
-Let's go.

114
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,085
Go after them!

115
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,798
Young master...

116
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,068
-Yesha, quick...
-I thought I lost you.

117
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,336
Quick.

118
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,071
Be careful.

119
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:52,552
Quick, Yesha.

120
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,156
-Come in, quick...
-Come in here.

121
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,992
Young master, I finally found you.

122
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,464
-You...
-I'm warning you.

123
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:06,866
Don't follow me. Do you hear me?

124
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:12,839
Quick!

125
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,349
Young master, don't run away!

126
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,118
Young master, come back!

127
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,554
What are you waiting for? Go get them.

128
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,922
-Understood.
-Understood.

129
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,497
You go that way. I'll go this way.

130
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,516
Ah Xing.

131
00:11:58,351 --> 00:11:59,552
Ah Xing, what's wrong with you?

132
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:01,221
Is this the right room?

133
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,328
Young master.

134
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,764
Young master, you come back.

135
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,834
Young master, what's wrong with you?

136
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,637
You don't recognize me?

137
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,472
You don't even recognize me.

138
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:53,940
I'm Aunt Yu.

139
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,477
Only eight minutes left.

140
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,146
Young master.

141
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,514
Don't be afraid.

142
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,951
It's me, Aunt Yu, who raised you up.

143
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:07,253
How can I harm you?

144
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,090
Take them down.

145
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,060
What are you doing?

146
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,896
The madam told us to keep you here.
Don't make this harder.

147
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:26,839
Quick, go.

148
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,741
Young master, don't leave me.

149
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:39,419
Young master, come back.

150
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,954
-Young master.
-Get out of my way.

151
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:43,389
Young master.

152
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:46,926
Follow me.

153
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:49,662
Young master.

154
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:55,735
Go.

155
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,140
Watch out, Aunt Yu.

156
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,150
Ma'am, the young master...

157
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,219
He... is gone.

158
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,321
You useless people!

159
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,323
Keep searching.

160
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:19,792
Inside and outside the house.

161
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,828
Find them no matter what.

162
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:23,262
Yes, ma'am.

163
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,398
You, go that way. You two, go that way.

164
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:26,966
You two, follow me.

165
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,290
The gate must be heavily guarded.

166
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:52,892
Don't fall into the trap.

167
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,427
This is the only way.

168
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,429
Now, go.

169
00:14:58,865 --> 00:14:59,866
Young master.

170
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,874
Go.

171
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:39,806
Ma'am.

172
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,274
Where are they?

173
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,009
Who?

174
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,712
You mean the young master.
I heard he's back.

175
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,781
I might saw him just now.

176
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:50,483
I followed him and...

177
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,285
he disappeared.

178
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:58,591
You useless people!

179
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,293
You can't even stop two people.

180
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:02,595
Continue searching.

181
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,864
You must find them.

182
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:06,732
Understood.

183
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:36,462
That was close.

184
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:42,168
I know my family is rich,
but I don't know the house is that huge.

185
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,605
I felt so cold in there.

186
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,707
-Cold?
-Yes.

187
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,041
Cold.

188
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,810
Except around that granny.

189
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,545
You mean Aunt Yu.

190
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,214
Aunt Yu.

191
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,250
Aunt Yu.

192
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,220
Weird. She seems to be
a nice person to me,

193
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:02,688
but why can't I remember anything?

194
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,258
-Who is she?
-Leave it be.

195
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,527
Now, we have the photo.

196
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,497
They seem to be your classmates.

197
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,601
We have new leads now.

198
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,471
Your school and your classmates.

199
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,395
Ah Si came back? Was he alone?

200
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,931
No. There was a girl.

201
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:46,365
I don't know her.

202
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,235
Could it be another Zhongze?

203
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,005
She doesn't look like a bad guy.

204
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,707
She was helping our young master.

205
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,275
She was kind to him.

206
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,643
How kind?

207
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,012
How kind?

208
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,147
Well...

209
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:02,782
Master Ximen.

210
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,750
I... I'm not sure about that.

211
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,119
No matter who she is,

212
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,221
she's good if she treats Ah Si nicely.

213
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:13,559
Aunt Yu.

214
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,227
They just broke in,

215
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,762
messed around,

216
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,064
and left again?

217
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:20,032
He was afraid of being caught by Madam.

218
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,069
If he was caught again,
he'll be locked up.

219
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,839
Is it like challenging the 18 Bronzemen?

220
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:29,041
Yes.

221
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:31,444
Ah Si is always full of surprise.

222
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:32,912
No one can predict his next move.

223
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:36,382
This is something Ah Si could do.

224
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,457
Masters, I've been here for a long time.

225
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:45,791
I have to get back now.

226
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,361
I'll tell you if there's any news
about the young master.

227
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:50,162
Thank you, Aunt Yu.

228
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,502
What are you doing?

229
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:58,270
I will tell Shancai about this.

230
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,710
How do you like it, sir?

231
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:07,780
Thank you.

232
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:13,753
Please have a taste of our fruit wine.
Do you want to give it a try, young lady?

233
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,122
It's very delicious. Do you want
to taste fruit wine, young lady?

234
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,323
It's really delicious.

235
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,858
Please have a taste of our fruit wine.

236
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:22,528
Please have a taste of our fruit wine.
Do you want to give it a try, young lady?

237
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:26,632
Please have a taste of our fruit wine.
Orange, strawberry, Hami melon flavors.

238
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:27,900
It's really delicious.

239
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,136
Please have a taste of our fruit wine.

240
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,838
Please have a taste of our fruit wine.

241
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:36,575
She's not answering.

242
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:42,048
It's weird. Shancai's phone
is either off or not answered.

243
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:47,753
You, too?

244
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:50,723
What is Shancai doing?

245
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,793
I don't think she's doing anything.

246
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,361
She's hiding.

247
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:59,498
Doing or hiding. It's fine
as long as she doesn't lose her memory.

248
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,134
We can just search the entire Taipei.

249
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,174
Boss.

250
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:09,675
This is Ximen.

251
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,444
Is Shancai there?

252
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,451
Could you please tell me
the other places she's working at?

253
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,500
Aunt Yu, you're back.

254
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,472
Ma... ma'am.

255
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:42,007
Did you meet Ah Si?

256
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:46,479
That's just what I thought.

257
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,281
There are so many people in the house.

258
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:52,818
Ah Si and that girl
don't have wings on them.

259
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,421
How could they just disappear?

260
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:57,923
Aunt Yu.

261
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:01,527
Did you help them sneak out?

262
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:03,763
No, ma'am.

263
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:06,966
I met Master Ximen and Master Meizuo.

264
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,535
I... I didn't meet our young master.

265
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,771
I don't know who he's with.

266
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,806
I don't know where he is now.

267
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:16,642
Aunt Yu.

268
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,512
At your age,

269
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:22,248
your brain's not working very well.

270
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:24,950
Ma'am.

271
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,620
Are you bringing up my retirement again?

272
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,422
I shouldn't have pitied you.

273
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,259
You said you heard Ah Si was sick

274
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,494
and you're too worried to sleep.

275
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,897
You kept begging me,

276
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:40,699
so I brought you back.

277
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:47,640
But the person you are now
can't tell what's good and bad for Ah Si

278
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:54,613
and can't be assigned to manage the house.

279
00:21:56,682 --> 00:22:00,085
Quit your job and enjoy your life,

280
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:03,622
or it'll be a burden

281
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,425
for the both of us.

282
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:09,595
Ma'am.

283
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,331
No one knows more
about this family than me.

284
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:16,035
I'm not in charge of managing it.

285
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,505
But our young master.

286
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:22,975
Why did he have to sneak
into his own house?

287
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:25,511
Why did he have to run away like that?

288
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:30,182
The young master was raised by me.

289
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,852
So, no matter what,

290
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,087
even I'm too old to walk,

291
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:37,790
I will protect the young master
to the end.

292
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,492
Don't you remember?

293
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:43,195
Ah Si doesn't remember you anymore,

294
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:50,836
so your appearance in the house
has no influence on Ah Si.

295
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:58,043
You've done a lot
for the Daoming family in decades.

296
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:00,012
So...

297
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:06,952
Don't sabotage your reputation
built by yourself at this age.

298
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:25,738
Your things are packed up by Butler Liu.

299
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:31,777
Just tell Butler Liu to send a car
to take you to your desired place.

300
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:58,837
Please have a taste of our fruit wine.
Orange, strawberry, Hami melon flavors.

301
00:23:58,904 --> 00:23:59,972
It's delicious.

302
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:02,141
Do you want to taste
our fruit wine, young lady?

303
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:04,276
Please have a taste of our fruit wine.

304
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:08,414
Please have a taste of our fruit wine.
Do you want to taste our fruit wine, sir?

305
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:22,461
It tastes strange.

306
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,132
But it's not bad.

307
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,668
How do you know I'm here?

308
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:31,837
We're here to sort you out.

309
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:34,206
Shancai, some friend you are.

310
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:44,083
Why are you wearing such an ugly costume?

311
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,352
Sir, do you want to taste our fruit wine?

312
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,188
Thank you.

313
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:51,323
She said "thank you" to us.

314
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,925
How should we scold her?

315
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:55,627
Want to taste it? It's very delicious.

316
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:01,500
Thank you.

317
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,274
Want to drink some fruit tea, young lady?

318
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,676
No, thank you.

319
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:15,047
Hey, Shancai.

320
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,017
Why are you exhausting yourself like that?

321
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:20,152
I want to make some money.

322
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,620
Besides paying my tuition,

323
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:23,622
I...

324
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,593
I'll tell it to you straight.

325
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,162
Do you know
those large electronic billboards?

326
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:34,633
I want to put on an ad to find Daoming Si.

327
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:37,169
Of course, I won't expose his identity.

328
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:41,073
However, it costs a lot to have such ad,
so I'm taking on one more job.

329
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:43,442
Why didn't you tell us about this?

330
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,379
Because you said it's stupid
to go high-profile.

331
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:49,782
The more I think about it,
the more stupid I realize it is.

332
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,918
I'm glad I didn't tell you that day,
or I would get scolded for shit.

333
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:54,586
Really?

334
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:58,023
I haven't seen a stinky snail before.

335
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:00,726
Who are you implying a snail?

336
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:03,195
I haven't scolded you yet.
What kind of message is that?

337
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:04,997
How can snail go upside down
with its shell?

338
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:06,598
You can carry me on your back and try it.

339
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,300
I'm not gonna fall into your trap.

340
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,536
If I stand upside down with you
on my back,

341
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,838
I will be the snail.

342
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:34,920
It's weird.

343
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,022
He told me to come here
without showing up.

344
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:39,258
What is Meizuo up to?

345
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:20,299
HUMOR TIME

346
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:35,013
AH SI, I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU FOREVER

347
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:42,654
AH SI, I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU FOREVER
0917-595600

348
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:49,728
Lei, Ximen, Meizuo, thank you.

349
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:51,563
Thank you.

350
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:04,309
AH SI, I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU FOREVER

351
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:30,736
AH SI, I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU FOREVER
0917-595600

352
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,676
-Hi.
-<i>Where are you?</i>

353
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:40,846
-Who is this?
-<i>I'm Si.</i>

354
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,849
-No, you're not.
-<i>Oh, I miss you so much.</i>

355
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,218
Quit messing with me.
I'm waiting for a call.

356
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:51,156
Hello.

357
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:54,693
<i>My name is Ah Si, too. I can show you
my ID card if you don't believe me.</i>

358
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,528
Sir, you're going too far.

359
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:59,665
<i>Come on, making a friend
costs you nothing.</i>

360
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:04,202
I'm begging you, okay? I'm waiting
for a very important phone call.

361
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,075
I'm taking on two jobs,
working over ten hours every day

362
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,777
just for this ad.

363
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,516
He is missing and he might be in danger

364
00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:19,151
and all I can do is to wait.

365
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,186
Waiting to hear his voice.

366
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:24,823
Even what he looks like
when he is talking is getting blurry.

367
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:32,097
I regret I didn't take more photos of him.

368
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:34,833
I regret I didn't record him with V8.

369
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,070
Do you know what is regret?

370
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:40,605
Have you ever experienced it?

371
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,375
Because if you have,

372
00:30:43,642 --> 00:30:47,346
I'm begging you to leave me alone,
and stop jamming the phone, okay?

373
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,128
<i>Hello.</i>

374
00:31:03,662 --> 00:31:05,564
<i>Sorry, it's me again.</i>

375
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:09,134
<i>I forget to tell you
that I hope you can find Si very soon.</i>

376
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,369
<i>I'm rooting for you.</i>

377
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:21,513
PAYPHONE

378
00:31:39,965 --> 00:31:40,966
Hello.

379
00:31:57,716 --> 00:32:00,018
Shan Cai, why didn't you answer
your phone?

380
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:02,721
Did you see that?

381
00:32:04,823 --> 00:32:05,891
Thank you.

382
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,631
Hello.

383
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:14,933
<i>Do you want to know where Ah Si is?</i>

384
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,468
<i>Come out and drink a cup of coffee.</i>

385
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:18,737
Boring.

386
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:21,907
What's wrong?

387
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,377
Nothing.

388
00:32:27,646 --> 00:32:28,914
It's just...

389
00:32:29,214 --> 00:32:31,450
I've been answering
random calls all night.

390
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,225
Didn't Ah Si call you?

391
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:45,363
Everyone was claiming they were Ah Si.

392
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,808
<i>Young lady, do you want a cup of coffee?</i>

393
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:58,577
Great, where?

394
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:05,283
Talk.

395
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:07,719
-Meizuo.
-Why don't you talk?

396
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:10,322
-What are you gonna do?
-Beat him up.

397
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:13,458
Forget it.

398
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,563
Hey, why did you turn off the phone?

399
00:33:18,964 --> 00:33:20,899
Do you want to get those harassing calls?

400
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,835
What if Daoming Si calls me?

401
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:26,705
<i>Your call will go to voicemail.</i>

402
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:28,373
<i>We'll start charging after the "beep."</i>

403
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,175
<i>Please hang up
if you won't leave a message.</i>

404
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,740
Hello.

405
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,310
<i>Hello.</i>

406
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:08,547
<i>Hello. Talk.</i>

407
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,682
You are Ah Si, right?

408
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,884
I'm telling you, you boring sick bastard.

409
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:14,686
I'll beat you up if you call again.

410
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,762
Why are there so many boring people?

411
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:27,999
Give it back.

412
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,070
Shancai.

413
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:34,139
Maybe this is not the right way.

414
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,775
Give it back.

415
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,111
Could you please see the reality?

416
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,254
I like it, okay?

417
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:57,162
This is my only hope now.

418
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:11,209
I didn't get the person
but a bunch of problems.

419
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:15,914
I should've left my phone number
and taught them a lesson.

420
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,851
We hope Shancai could be the first one
to get Ah Si's call.

421
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:24,055
Turn off the billboard.

422
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,759
The more you hope,
the more disappointed you will be.

423
00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:32,097
I'm worried about another breakdown
of Shancai.

424
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:36,434
Maybe after a few breakdowns,
she can accept the fact.

425
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:42,340
Sometimes I really wonder
if you're from outer space.

426
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,210
I am.

427
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,248
Come on.

428
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:51,750
There won't be four of us anyway.

429
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,521
We won't have many opportunities
to drink together.

430
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:57,756
Cheers.

431
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,293
Why won't we have
many opportunities to drink?

432
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:09,300
I was hoping to celebrate with you
after we find Ah Si.

433
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:11,269
Celebrate for what?

434
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,138
I'm going to work tomorrow.

435
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:18,376
The graduation trip is over.

436
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:19,944
It's time to do some work.

437
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:24,916
That's right.

438
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,651
The graduation trip is over.

439
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:29,020
Cheers!

440
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:55,346
You are not the "si"
in one, two, three, four.

441
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:57,582
You are this "Si."

442
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,767
You're called F4 in Yingde.

443
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:17,602
Do you know what is F4?

444
00:37:18,203 --> 00:37:22,073
You're young dudes that are like brothers.

445
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,008
Like four flowers.

446
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:28,213
Everyone in our school knows you.

447
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:31,416
I've been asking around. See.

448
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:33,952
I got their phone numbers and addresses.

449
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:36,821
I called them.

450
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:40,859
I saw their missing person poster.

451
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:43,361
What missing person poster?

452
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:45,396
The electronic billboards on the streets.

453
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,200
I called them and was scolded.

454
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,536
Who are they?

455
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:53,972
How could they scold people like that?

456
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,308
They're looking for you
but are scolding you.

457
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,778
Maybe they didn't know who you are.

458
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:02,580
Even I wasn't myself,
they can't scold people like that.

459
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,889
Maybe I shouldn't know who they are.

460
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:19,464
Maybe I shouldn't know who I am.

461
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,299
Ah Xing.

462
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,602
Why does it seem
that everyone around me is bad?

463
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:29,107
What kind of people was I?

464
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:31,643
Who am I?

465
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,077
What are you doing?

466
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:35,613
What are you doing?
Tearing down the house?

467
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,448
-Granny.
-See.

468
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:39,984
I knew it. You won't help me water them.

469
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:41,486
My flowers are dying of thirst.

470
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:42,787
Let me help you.

471
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:43,788
-Now?
-Okay.

472
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:44,956
-Right now.
-Right now.

473
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:51,462
You should change if you want to.

474
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,264
Your past stays in the past.

475
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,567
It's who you are now that matters.

476
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,236
The most important thing is,

477
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:02,373
remember paying your rent.

478
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:08,613
-Go water them.
-Will do...

479
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,715
If my babies die of thirst,

480
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:13,785
-I'll come for you.
-Don't worry, Granny. I'm watering them.

481
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:28,499
-What are you doing?
-Putting out your fire.

482
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:30,635
You're the one that should be watered.
Why did you water me?

483
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:55,193
You're laughing now.

484
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:56,761
Are you happy now?

485
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:05,036
-Out of water...
-You...

486
00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:14,305
Senior.

487
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:17,809
Who are you?

488
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,079
I'm doing a life interview
about the graduating seniors.

489
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,914
I don't know if you're available now.

490
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:24,983
Life interview?

491
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,452
I don't think it's necessary.

492
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:28,987
Please, senior.

493
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:31,990
This will affect my sociology score
in the next semester.

494
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,359
Please, senior.

495
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:40,098
All right, get in the car.

496
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,353
Thank you.

497
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:16,034
I don't remember meeting you in Yingde?

498
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:18,770
How could you remember
all the girls in Yingde?

499
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,672
I remember all the beautiful ones.

500
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:23,775
So I'm not beautiful enough?

501
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:27,378
You are.

502
00:42:27,512 --> 00:42:29,547
You are beautiful and smart.

503
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:33,584
I'm so happy
that I get praised by a senior.

504
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:37,855
Right, have you started working?

505
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:40,792
We want to know what you will do
after graduation.

506
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:44,829
You must be working
in your family corporations, right?

507
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:49,600
Speaking of it, Ximen is the first one
to settle down.

508
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:53,037
Lei and I will start working soon.

509
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:59,577
How about Daoming Si?

510
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:03,014
He hasn't returned
from the graduation trip.

511
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:07,085
Please don't get mad
at the question I'll ask you.

512
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:08,719
Go ahead.

513
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:12,723
Why are there rumors saying
that Daoming Si is in trouble?

514
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:15,393
Are there?

515
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,061
Who says that?

516
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:20,431
The missing person posters
in the newspapers

517
00:43:20,498 --> 00:43:22,166
and the large billboard on the street.

518
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:29,207
You must be very worried, right?

519
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,808
You're so close.

520
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:35,379
Isn't this a life interview?

521
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,215
Why is it a soul interview now?

522
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:12,109
