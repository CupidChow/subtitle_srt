1
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,596
Maybe I'll never know
how many times I made you cry.

2
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:15,168
However, all I can say is...

3
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,107
thank you, Shancai.

4
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:25,579
Thank you for accepting the new me.

5
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,316
You're welcome.

6
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,446
<i>That hug was only out of gratitude.</i>

7
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:33,780
<i>What was I thinking?</i>

8
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,218
<i>If Yesha truly doesn't love Daoming Si,</i>

9
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,253
<i>should I go for it then?</i>

10
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:19,259
<i>But what can I do to replace the memories
of Yesha in Daoming Si's heart?</i>

11
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:40,547
<i>Daoming Si's past has already been erased.</i>

12
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,361
<i>Shancai, you shouldn't be stuck
in Daoming Si's past.</i>

13
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:55,829
<i>You should be a new friend to him.</i>

14
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:58,732
<i>Laugh with him, share his burden.</i>

15
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:03,069
<i>Perhaps one day, he will fall in love
with this new friend again.</i>

16
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,256
<i>But how about Yesha?</i>

17
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,527
<i>Was her changed behavior really because
of the engagement?</i>

18
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,299
Hurry.

19
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,901
-Accelerate.
-Faster.

20
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,970
-Time is running out.
-Hurry up.

21
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,941
FATAL ACCIDENT

22
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,945
The car crashed.

23
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,283
What a pity.

24
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:26,052
She's leaving.

25
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:30,991
CELEBRATION PARTY

26
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,576
A billion-dollar revenue.

27
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:50,877
That's my buddy.

28
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,746
We're very proud of you.

29
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,948
Now you won't complain
about me being always busy, right?

30
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,683
Who said that? We'll still complain.

31
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,184
Excuse me, sir.

32
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,152
Thank you.

33
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:08,194
How do you do?

34
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,875
That lady in black over there.
I don't think we've met her.

35
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,678
Where is Mr. Ximen?

36
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,521
She's Ying Xiaociao, the daughter
of the president of Jundi Construction.

37
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,289
She just graduated from the US.

38
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:42,529
Another precious pretty face
with no brain.

39
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:52,505
Greetings.

40
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:54,774
Greetings, President.

41
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:07,921
Ximen.

42
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,790
That's all right, I'm used to it.

43
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,127
My father has always been so exceptional.

44
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:17,130
If he doesn't bring along
a pretty mistress for this occasion,

45
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,899
how would people know
what a womanizer he is?

46
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:23,970
-Greetings, President.
-Hello.

47
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:25,138
President.

48
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:28,975
President.

49
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:33,980
Long time no see, boys.

50
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,349
-Sir, congrats.
-Congrats.

51
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,586
Don't congratulate me.
Congratulate your buddy.

52
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,690
Yeah. Now we can
share a bit of his limelight.

53
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,593
Ximen, congratulations.

54
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,168
What should I call you, gentlemen?

55
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:56,836
I'm Meizuo.

56
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:57,971
Just call me Lei.

57
00:08:58,338 --> 00:08:59,539
I'm Christy.

58
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,540
Hi, Meizuo.

59
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,075
-Greetings.
-Greetings, Lei.

60
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,243
Greetings.

61
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,377
Ladies and gentlemen.

62
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:09,616
First of all, on behalf
of the Ximen Corporation,

63
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,185
I thank you for all your support.

64
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:17,357
The latest sales revenue
of Ximen Corporation

65
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,593
has reached a new record

66
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:24,597
of one billion NT dollars
in just three weeks.

67
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:30,036
Manager Ximen,
who led the entire marketing project,

68
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:33,106
is indeed much like his father.

69
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,749
Since this is a celebration party,

70
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:47,487
we must hear what he has to say

71
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:51,357
about the joys and challenges
of his great accomplishment.

72
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:55,462
Nevertheless, behind every talent

73
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:58,798
is a great support.

74
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:03,837
Let's first welcome President Ximen

75
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,005
to say a few words for us.

76
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,229
Thank you very much for coming.

77
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,601
I've been in this business for decades.

78
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,905
I've never felt happier than today.

79
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:42,809
I believe that what I feel right now

80
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:49,315
is something that any parent
would understand.

81
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,219
And to my guests
who haven't built a family yet,

82
00:10:55,455 --> 00:11:01,394
one day, you will understand

83
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,130
that when a father's devoted teachings

84
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:07,400
and sincere hopes

85
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:10,103
for his son

86
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:15,842
have all paid off,

87
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,180
it's really an indescribable feeling.

88
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:24,884
As a father myself,

89
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:31,291
I feel immensely excited and proud.

90
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,867
And for now, I won't say more than needed.

91
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:46,539
Let's now focus on tonight's star.

92
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:02,789
Thank you.

93
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,492
The sales revenue of a billion NT dollars
in three weeks

94
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,361
was definitely not achieved by me alone.

95
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:13,199
It was the result
of the entire company's contribution.

96
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:18,371
I want to thank my secretary, Mr. Xu,
who works overtime with me every day.

97
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:21,007
Thank our general manager
for his recognition.

98
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:25,912
Thank the whole marketing department
for extending the deadline for me.

99
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:31,551
Also, I must thank my mother.

100
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:41,661
My mother always waits at home
without saying a word.

101
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,534
She waits for a husband
who never comes home

102
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,603
and for a son who's hardly at home.

103
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,574
My mother's patience to wait

104
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,477
has always been my greatest support.

105
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:02,782
Of course,

106
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,386
I thank my father, too.

107
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,323
If he didn't deny me in the beginning,

108
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,959
it would be impossible
to discover my potential.

109
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,028
Thanks, Dad.

110
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:21,901
Everybody,

111
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,138
for the hard work of President

112
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:28,574
and Manager Ximen,

113
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,809
let's have a toast.

114
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:32,445
Cheers.

115
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,752
Thank you.

116
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,466
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

117
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:54,600
I'll go to the restroom.

118
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:54,260
You need to watch your attitude
towards me.

119
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,297
I've always thought
that "attitude" is only for show.

120
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:03,136
I have no interest in acting
when there is no audience.

121
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:06,572
I am your father.

122
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:09,976
You should respect me.

123
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:12,278
Why should you be acting?

124
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,417
Isn't it better to lead by example?

125
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:22,355
If you want me to respect you,
please respect my mother first.

126
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,956
That way I can learn faster.

127
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:27,693
What do you know about me and your mother?

128
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:29,896
I know nothing.

129
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,465
But I can see.

130
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:34,767
What do you see?

131
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,169
Your mother and I--

132
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:39,772
Sir.

133
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:47,113
Mr. Xu.

134
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,314
Yes, President.

135
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,451
What is it?

136
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:55,455
The representatives of Daoming
and Yungfu Corporation are here, sir.

137
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:13,573
Congrats.

138
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:14,907
What's the use of saying that?

139
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,209
Let's have a drink later.

140
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,844
Let's do that. I'm not afraid of you.

141
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,016
Where's Yesha?

142
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,751
Yeah.

143
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:29,856
She's a bit unwell.

144
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:31,958
Again?

145
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,261
Hey, I'm so hungry.

146
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,896
Let's eat something.

147
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,231
Let's go.

148
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:39,665
I hid something nice outside.

149
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,653
Sir, President Daoming's on the phone.

150
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,193
President Daoming, it's been a while.

151
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:09,862
No problem.

152
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,864
Ah Si here is good enough.

153
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,566
I know you're very busy.

154
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:16,802
You're too kind.

155
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:19,105
Ximen.

156
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,407
What are you doing?

157
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:22,341
Let's go.

158
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:23,543
Yeah.

159
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,255
Sir.

160
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:40,026
Excuse me.

161
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:41,561
Sir.

162
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:26,505
Shancai.

163
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,408
-Shancai.
-Shancai.

164
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:30,376
Shancai.

165
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,579
Shancai, come have a drink.

166
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,050
Shancai!

167
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,619
Shancai.

168
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,390
Shancai!

169
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,395
Keep it down. People are sleeping.

170
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:56,969
Hurry up.

171
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,040
Shancai!

172
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,775
Shancai!

173
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,312
Hardworking virgin!

174
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,149
Shancai!

175
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,618
-Shancai.
-Shancai!

176
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,253
Shancai.

177
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:16,255
Shancai.

178
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:17,823
Why are you here?

179
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:22,828
You didn't come to my celebration party,
so I came over for you.

180
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,364
Sorry, I'm working overtime.

181
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:29,201
Hey! What are you doing?
Abusing employees?

182
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:31,904
No more bullshit.

183
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,040
Drink three glasses.

184
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:37,343
It smells so strong.

185
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,545
Don't cheat, drink three glasses.

186
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,913
I want it, too.

187
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:43,749
Come on.

188
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:47,386
More!

189
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:54,593
I really have to drink three glasses?

190
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:56,996
-I'll take this.
-I'll take this.

191
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,281
Where's the restroom?

192
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:17,917
Over there, I'll take you there.

193
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:20,486
This way. I'll take you there.

194
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,188
Be careful.

195
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:48,314
It looks like you guys
have a new beginning.

196
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:51,951
Hopefully, a good one.

197
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:57,289
I haven't congratulated you yet, Ximen.
I'm truly happy for you.

198
00:20:58,691 --> 00:20:59,558
Thank you.

199
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,831
But I don't feel happy at all.

200
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:08,033
What's wrong?

201
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,736
Nothing.

202
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,306
I just don't think there's anything
to be happy about.

203
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,311
The applause, the billion-dollar revenue,

204
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:21,380
the bright future.

205
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:25,017
None of these feel real.

206
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,120
I know why.

207
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:29,855
You do?

208
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:33,192
Because you don't have someone
in your heart.

209
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,262
Don't lecture me about true love again.

210
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:42,001
There's not even a girl in your life
who you can keep for a week.

211
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:46,539
You know, your weekly affairs won't
compare to having someone in your heart

212
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:48,207
who you can rely on.

213
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,878
That's because I'm lazy.

214
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,519
Xiaoyou said hi.

215
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,161
How is she?

216
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:12,231
Why not ask her yourself?

217
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,702
Are you trying
to push your friend into the fire?

218
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:20,873
You're forgetting
that I've inherited genes from my father.

219
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:23,409
Genes that break women's hearts.

220
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:56,342
You're back, Young Master.

221
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:00,813
Thank you.

222
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:07,353
Where is she?

223
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,722
She's in her room.
Do you want to see her, sir?

224
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,625
It's fine. You can take a rest now.

225
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:13,525
Yes.

226
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:56,368
Mom.

227
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:58,437
There you are.

228
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:13,285
Why are you still awake?

229
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:15,087
I was waiting for you.

230
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:18,057
Did you have fun?

231
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,359
Of course not, since you weren't there.

232
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:24,096
Weren't Ah Si
and the other boys all there?

233
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:25,764
But still, you weren't.

234
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:28,600
Fine. I'm sorry.

235
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,671
Why are you still painting so late
at night?

236
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,442
Are you hungry? What do you want to eat?

237
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:38,744
How did you know I haven't eaten yet?

238
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,346
I'm your mom.

239
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,215
Then I want...

240
00:24:43,282 --> 00:24:44,350
spicy wontons.

241
00:24:57,363 --> 00:25:00,265
Your spicy wontons are matchless.

242
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:05,471
What's wrong?

243
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,173
My stomach's aching these days.

244
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:11,577
Don't eat this anymore. It's too spicy.
Have some chicken soup.

245
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:12,678
No.

246
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,119
I'm very happy.

247
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:22,254
I'll surely have sweet dreams tonight.

248
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,190
That is if your sleep is not ruined
by your stomachache.

249
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,694
Hey, it's strange.

250
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:32,531
After having your spicy wontons,
my stomach aches no more.

251
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:34,500
What a miracle.

252
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:35,734
Yeah, right.

253
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,776
-Mom, this is really delicious.
-Have some chicken soup.

254
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:30,115
You stayed up all night?

255
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,120
I couldn't sleep anyway.

256
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,292
Do you want to check if I've bought you
the correct items?

257
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,396
I bought you turpentine, pigments,

258
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:47,065
paint brushes, and brush washer.

259
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,203
I bought everything the owner mentioned.
Let me know if you still need anything.

260
00:27:59,044 --> 00:27:59,912
Ah Xing.

261
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,481
Thank you.

262
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:07,920
No need to thank me.

263
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:11,890
I just want you to be happy.

264
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:34,933
Who might you be looking for?

265
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:36,868
I'm looking for Yesha.

266
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:39,738
Why are you looking for Miss Yesha?

267
00:30:39,805 --> 00:30:40,839
Hey.

268
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:44,209
Have the laws in Taiwan
changed in just a few years?

269
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:47,713
Do I need to inform you first
of my purpose of visiting Yesha?

270
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,081
Let me inform you.

271
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:51,683
If you're uncomfortable
stating your purpose,

272
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,352
you would have to leave.

273
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:54,453
What?

274
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,555
I think you should check it out first.

275
00:30:56,621 --> 00:31:00,158
I am an honored guest invited by Yesha.

276
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:02,728
I don't care
whatever type of guest you are.

277
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:04,596
As long as you don't state
your purpose of visit,

278
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:07,432
the Daoming mansion
is off-limits to random guests.

279
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:08,400
See him out.

280
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:09,868
Hey!

281
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,204
You think you're the man, right?

282
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:15,574
But I assure you,
you won't last more than three minutes.

283
00:31:16,141 --> 00:31:18,043
If you don't ask Yesha to come out,

284
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:22,614
I'll show you my ultimate move.

285
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:25,050
Yesha!

286
00:31:25,684 --> 00:31:27,753
Yesha!

287
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:31,957
Yesha!

288
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:35,761
Yesha!

289
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:39,865
Yesha!

290
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,333
Yesha!

291
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:43,468
Sha?

292
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:45,437
Sha!

293
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:48,673
I knew you wouldn't leave me alone.

294
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,576
She's here. Now what?

295
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,588
This is the longest time
you've stayed mad at me.

296
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:04,990
Five whole days.

297
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,997
You have no idea
how I've spent those days.

298
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:15,300
I even lost my appetite.

299
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:17,335
Really?

300
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,005
But why didn't you slim down?

301
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:23,875
Because I've been having noodles.

302
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:31,450
Hey.

303
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:34,152
This house is really cool.

304
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,188
More like cold.

305
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:38,657
Don't worry.

306
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:43,895
Anywhere with Sha
is not a cold place, okay?

307
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:48,233
But inside this cold palace
lives a scary old hag.

308
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,568
Old hag?

309
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:51,736
What a coincidence.

310
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:56,308
I'm an expert in dealing with old hags.

311
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:58,977
That's why I told you to come.

312
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:01,179
I didn't, because you've hurt my feelings.

313
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:04,950
What's there to be hurt
about my engagement?

314
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:10,789
Why did you make Shancai
an employee in their company?

315
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,261
This must be a scam.

316
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:20,265
You made a deal with the old hag

317
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:25,303
so that Shancai and Ah Xing
can be together,

318
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:29,608
so that they can be reconciled
with each other. Am I right?

319
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:32,978
How did you know all this?

320
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:35,380
This is just stupid.

321
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,883
I knew it. That's a no-brainer.

322
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:39,284
Yesha.

323
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,988
It's true that Shancai is a good girl.

324
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:47,025
But it's up to their destiny

325
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:49,060
whether they'll be together.

326
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:52,330
It's not going to work out
because of some scam you created.

327
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:56,668
That's right, but Ah Xing's mother
has been keeping him from seeing Shancai.

328
00:33:57,002 --> 00:33:59,104
If I don't help Shancai
fight for her opportunities,

329
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,372
what can she do?

330
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:05,143
But then who would fight for yours?

331
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,048
That's why I'm here.

332
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:14,953
Sha.

333
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:18,023
I don't need it.

334
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:21,159
I already stand no chance.

335
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,064
My muscles have begun to weaken.

336
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:29,234
My vision has become blurred.

337
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:34,306
I can almost see my own end.

338
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:40,946
That's why I've come.

339
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:46,084
I'm here to see if we can make Ah Xing
and Shancai be together sooner.

340
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,420
Let them be a couple.

341
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:52,857
So that we can also go travel
around the world sooner.

342
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:57,762
Sha.

343
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,699
What would I do without you?

344
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,767
Silly.

345
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:04,836
I'm always here.

346
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,407
Silly.

347
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,944
I'll show you the studio.

348
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:14,212
Over there.

349
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:37,469
Thank you.

350
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:39,237
How much is it?

351
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:41,239
It's my treat, okay?

352
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:42,874
Thank you.

353
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:47,846
What?

354
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:50,949
Would the old me react differently?

355
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:52,751
It doesn't matter.

356
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,319
You are who you are now.

357
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:22,147
So how would I react earlier
if it was the old me?

358
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:27,152
You would play cool and scold me.

359
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:30,588
"Why are you so annoying, woman?
How can someone like me let you treat me?"

360
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,057
Really?

361
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:39,764
I had such a bad temper,
and scolded you a lot.

362
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:40,932
Why did you still like me?

363
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:42,934
Because...

364
00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:49,507
<i>Why was I into you?</i>

365
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:52,010
<i>I often used to ask myself that as well.</i>

366
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,212
<i>I never came up with an answer.</i>

367
00:36:54,813 --> 00:36:58,083
<i>The feeling just grew stronger day by day.</i>

368
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:02,787
It's hot. Don't touch it.

369
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,564
Three-cup squid, I missed its taste.

370
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,565
Have a piece of it first.

371
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:14,833
This one tastes better.

372
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:15,767
Here.

373
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:16,935
What's the smell?

374
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:21,573
Sha.

375
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:22,507
Ah Xing.

376
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:24,909
I knew it was you
the moment I smelled the food.

377
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:28,680
Look at you, looking more and more decent.

378
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:30,281
Oh, shut up.

379
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:33,184
Yeah, give this honored guest
a tight hug to welcome him.

380
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,354
This is...

381
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:37,489
Madam.

382
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:40,158
Still as graceful after these months.

383
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:41,960
Mr. Sha,

384
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:44,596
you may call me Mrs. Daoming.

385
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,832
Mrs. Daoming, Madam.

386
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:51,436
I might have to trouble you for a few days
while I'm here in Taiwan.

387
00:37:51,503 --> 00:37:54,172
But I haven't brought
any presents for you.

388
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:58,209
So, here's my signature three-cup squid
as a token of my respect.

389
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,878
Come on. Try it.

390
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,781
-Come on. Have a seat.
-Wow, such nice food.

391
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:04,582
Have a seat.

392
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:11,523
Mr. Sha, there's no need for formalities.

393
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:14,726
As you wish.

394
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:17,128
As long as you're not impolite,

395
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:18,997
how dare I not be polite?

396
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:26,104
Someone clean up this disgusting smell
in the house quickly.

397
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:27,105
Yes, ma'am.

398
00:38:29,274 --> 00:38:32,811
As far as I know, there are only two types
of people in this world

399
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:35,847
who dislike the smell of food cooked
with garlic, green onion, and ginger root,

400
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:37,849
and sautéed with high flames.

401
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:41,085
They're either people who lack courage

402
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,888
or people who lack love.

403
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:46,624
But Madam,

404
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:49,227
you don't look like someone
who lacks courage.

405
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:50,161
Therefore,

406
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:53,731
you must lack love.

407
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,305
Mr. Sha.

408
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,308
You're a guest in our house.

409
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:06,778
Next time, please don't bother yourself
with kitchen work.

410
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,747
That would be a problem.

411
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:14,185
Because Yesha likes the food
I particularly cook.

412
00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:15,186
Yeah.

413
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,454
Me, too.

414
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,126
You are all so ignorant.

415
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:26,197
How can you trouble our guest
with the servants' work?

416
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:28,833
Not at all.

417
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:34,606
I remember Yesha
likes my steamed bat the most.

418
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:39,110
And red braised bamboo viper.

419
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:41,846
Also spicy earthworms.

420
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,783
And grasshoppers.

421
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,051
Good for detoxification.

422
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:03,167
Ma'am, are you okay?

423
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:07,438
I'll leave you be.

424
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:22,020
I think your mother lack
a great deal of love.

425
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:26,190
Yesha, we must think of a way
to help her gain more love.

426
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,392
Sir.

427
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,802
Sir, are you all right?

428
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:15,573
Ma'am.

429
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,409
Ma'am, would you like to go upstairs
for a rest first?

430
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,478
-I'm all right. You go and do your thing.
-Okay, ma'am.

431
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:24,215
-Ma'am, the President is here.
-Okay.

432
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:32,023
-President.
-How is he doing now?

433
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:34,792
He was diagnosed with gastric perforation.
Now he's in surgery.

434
00:41:44,736 --> 00:41:46,204
President, Madam...

435
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:48,139
Okay.

436
00:42:16,434 --> 00:42:17,735
Is everything well at home?

437
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:20,772
Yes.

438
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:30,782
My son...

439
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,018
He doesn't understand me.

440
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:41,626
He's my son, too.

441
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:50,334
He's my only hope.

442
00:42:59,644 --> 00:43:01,045
What do want me to do, then?

443
00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:06,084
There's nothing I ask of you.

444
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:10,354
Our son is all grown up.

445
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:17,095
I just wish I had more chance
to get to know him better.

446
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:44,021
You're awake?

447
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:46,591
-Mom.
-Don't move.

448
00:43:46,858 --> 00:43:47,792
Lie down.

449
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,294
Does it still hurt?

450
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:52,063
Lie still.

451
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:56,901
Mom, I'm sorry. I made you worry.

452
00:43:58,703 --> 00:44:00,538
You didn't take good care of yourself.

453
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:03,708
My heart jumped up
when I got that phone call.

454
00:44:09,714 --> 00:44:11,449
Your father was just here.

455
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:16,187
He worried about you

456
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:18,823
while keeping himself looking strong.

457
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:21,292
I suddenly understood

458
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:24,162
that no matter what he's been through,

459
00:44:24,529 --> 00:44:26,564
a father is a father.

460
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:29,267
I don't care about his concern.

461
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,269
My mom is all I need.

462
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:35,206
Ximen.

463
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,776
There are issues
between me and your father.

464
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:43,114
But the issues
are not just what they appear to be.

465
00:44:43,915 --> 00:44:44,882
Mom.

466
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:47,418
I'm not a child anymore.

467
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,955
I understand all your problems.

468
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,525
The belief that nobody's right or wrong
when it comes to love,

469
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,795
and how men just can't help being flirty.

470
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:00,398
You're my mother.

471
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:03,534
I don't care about other women.

472
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:06,137
I don't want to see my mom suffer
because of men.

473
00:45:07,305 --> 00:45:08,372
Ximen.

474
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,375
There are still many things
you don't know.

475
00:45:12,944 --> 00:45:14,612
In fact, for all these years,

476
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:17,715
it's your father who has been suffering
because of me.

477
00:47:01,085 --> 00:47:03,087
