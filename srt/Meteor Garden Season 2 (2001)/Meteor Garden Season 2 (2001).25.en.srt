1
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,125
Shancai, we think alike.

2
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:07,327
You called me
the moment I wanted to call you.

3
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:10,464
Maybe it's
because we often share the same thoughts.

4
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,003
After you.

5
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,006
You can play first. I'm so bad at this.

6
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,041
Okay.

7
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:31,952
Give me everything you got, Yesha!

8
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,178
You're awesome as always, Yesha.

9
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:01,014
No, I'm not.
I only knocked down eight pins.

10
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,907
I've reached my peak.

11
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,275
You might be different this time.

12
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,010
Your skill might've improved a lot.

13
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:30,977
Your turn.

14
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,245
Okay.

15
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,734
Go for it, Shancai!

16
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:31,238
Shancai.

17
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,508
Keep your body low when throwing the ball.

18
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,843
Keep your arm straight
and your wrist steady.

19
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,378
Don't look down,

20
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,547
keep your eyes on the pins
in front of you.

21
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:42,482
You can do it.

22
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,102
You nailed it.

23
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:03,570
Want to try again?

24
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:04,471
Yeah.

25
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:07,707
Go for it, Shancai!

26
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,029
You see? I told you
that you made real progress.

27
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,630
I tried very hard.

28
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,432
No, I tried my best.

29
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,601
This is the highest score I can get

30
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,303
but I still lost the game.

31
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,811
I only got 25.

32
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,984
Shancai.

33
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,023
I fell in love with Ah Xing.

34
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:03,897
I know.

35
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,570
Actually, I've known it for a long time.

36
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,507
You jumped into the water
to save Daoming Si,

37
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,611
and you said you were a dolphin
in your past life,

38
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,479
and you said
you want to travel around the world,

39
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,748
but you still haven't left yet.

40
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,551
Not long after we first met,

41
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,153
I could see the light in your eyes

42
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:30,657
even when you were complaining about
your stray dog with a frowny face.

43
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,425
That's when I knew it.

44
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,230
I refused to face the truth.

45
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,237
Why don't you scold me?

46
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,507
You should scold me for lying,

47
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:50,410
for breaking my promises,

48
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,947
and for being a disloyal friend.

49
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:57,617
I've been lying to you all this time.

50
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,155
Shancai.

51
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,427
If you never want to see me again,

52
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,562
I understand.

53
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:15,969
Yesha,

54
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,104
love is selfish.

55
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:22,008
When I was trying to get Daoming Si back,

56
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,411
weren't you in pain too?

57
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,688
I don't blame you at all, Yesha.

58
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:36,790
Instead, I want to thank you.

59
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,526
If it were not for you,
always encouraging me,

60
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,295
and giving me opportunities
to get him back,

61
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,966
I wouldn't feel so relieved like now.

62
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:49,436
I wouldn't give up so calmly.

63
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:52,505
Shancai.

64
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,910
Is it because... I told you everything...

65
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:59,813
Don't you always say
that our minds are in sync?

66
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,615
I've met with you here to tell you,

67
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:07,354
that only one of us
can stay with Daoming Si.

68
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,157
It is not me. It's you.

69
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:14,561
But you've made some progress.

70
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,930
You've been making progress every day.

71
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,000
Ah Si has been making progress too.

72
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:22,869
When he regains his memory,

73
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:25,005
I'm sure that he will love you again.

74
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,844
Are you scared of that day, Yesha?

75
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,552
Yes.

76
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,758
Are you going to wait for that day?

77
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,982
Same as usual?

78
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:11,818
Yeah.

79
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:13,853
Let's split up here as usual.

80
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,557
Shancai...

81
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,094
You take care of yourself.

82
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,135
Try your best.

83
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,540
You too.

84
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,241
Daoming Si is so hard to deal with.

85
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:38,845
Who am I to lecture you?

86
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,613
I'm sure you can handle him.

87
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:47,987
No, Yesha.

88
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,422
You can't cry.

89
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,257
Same as usual, remember?

90
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,027
You go that way,

91
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,395
I'll go this way.

92
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:57,230
Don't turn back and don't cry.

93
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:02,569
Yeah.

94
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:05,004
We'll only be happy for each other.

95
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,075
We'll turn around when I count to three.

96
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:11,911
You didn't turn around last time.

97
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,179
Don't do that this time.

98
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:19,919
One, two, three.

99
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,080
<i>I want to praise myself for being brave</i>

100
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:53,019
<i>but I know that I'm not ready
to face this decision.</i>

101
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:56,356
<i>I have to flee as far as I can.</i>

102
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,498
TO MOM AND DAD

103
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:14,440
<i>Mom and dad,</i>

104
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,643
<i>I decided to go to the countryside
to visit a friend.</i>

105
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:19,679
<i>This is also a vacation to reward myself. </i>

106
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,584
Hey, stop!

107
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:07,954
You stole my wallet, right?

108
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,222
What are you talking about?

109
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,924
You bumped into me on the train
and stole my wallet, right?

110
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:13,626
Are you nuts?

111
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:15,128
You can't accuse people like that!

112
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,863
I'm warning you. Give my wallet back!

113
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,432
Get your hands off me
or I'm going to beat you up.

114
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:20,333
I'm calling the police!

115
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,268
Give me back my wallet.
Where did you hide it?

116
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:25,038
-Don't do this just because you're a girl.
-Don't treat girls like weaklings!

117
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,606
Where did you hide it? Give it back!

118
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:27,874
Get your hands off me!

119
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,008
Give it back, right now!

120
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:29,976
-You thief!
-Hey, stop!

121
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:31,744
I'm going to scream!
I'm going to call for help!

122
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,845
Give it back, right now!

123
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,447
I really didn't steal your wallet.

124
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,282
-You lunatic--
-Give it back! Where is it?

125
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:37,450
You! Go home right now!

126
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:39,819
What are you doing?

127
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:41,087
Get lost.

128
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:42,989
Who are you?

129
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:45,825
I said go home.

130
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:47,860
I didn't do anything wrong.

131
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,062
-It's her--
-Go home, right now.

132
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:53,433
Hey, come back here.

133
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,567
-I'm calling the police--
-Hey!

134
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,169
Did you hear what I said? Leave him alone!

135
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,136
Get lost!

136
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:59,572
What are you talking about?
He just stole my wallet.

137
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,074
-Hey, come back here, did you--
-Hey!

138
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,343
How can you accuse my brother?

139
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,445
So the money he's given you
isn't enough, right?

140
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,380
Look what you got him into.

141
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,350
If you have any conscience at all,
stop seducing him

142
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,285
or I'll knock your teeth out!

143
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:14,454
Miss, you've got the wrong person.

144
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,823
No, I got pretty sharp eyes.

145
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,224
You're exactly what a slut looks like.

146
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,026
I'm not a slut!

147
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:22,261
I only met him on the train!

148
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,109
AH MEI DESSERT SHOP

149
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:37,944
Who is he?

150
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,345
I think he's Ah Mei's older brother.

151
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,252
What took you so long?

152
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:47,353
-Sorry.
-You're way too late.

153
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,523
Who's that guy?

154
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:52,959
I think he's Ah Mei's older brother.

155
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:54,460
Ah Mei's older brother?

156
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,562
-Why haven't I heard of him?
-His name is Ah De.

157
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:59,565
What's the matter?

158
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,134
No, nothing.

159
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,637
Then can we eat shaved ice today?

160
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,239
Yeah.

161
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:07,540
Let's get inside and check it out.

162
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:22,255
Say it.

163
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:25,758
Hi. Are you really Ah Mei's older brother?

164
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:32,165
We didn't know Ah Mei has a brother.

165
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,599
That's because you don't know her well.

166
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:34,567
We don't know her well?

167
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:36,803
Dada comes here to see her every day.

168
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,371
-Yeah.
-Who's Dada?

169
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,440
-It's him.
-Hi, man, I'm Dada.

170
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:41,474
Nice to meet you.

171
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:42,875
Ah Mei.

172
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,712
Get out.

173
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,014
Get out!

174
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,282
But we're here to eat shaved ice.

175
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,250
Get out! There's no shaved ice
for you today.

176
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,618
Get out!

177
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:55,755
Why are you hitting me?

178
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,025
Why did you steal her wallet?
Give it back to her.

179
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,327
How many times do I have to tell you?
I didn't steal her wallet.

180
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:02,528
You're lying to me now?

181
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,731
I see stolen wallets in the garbage can
every time you come back.

182
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,366
If you didn't steal her wallet,

183
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,235
why were you staring at her on the train?

184
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,637
I told you I didn't do it!

185
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,440
Hey, you're so weird.

186
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,309
-Why are you accusing me?
-What are you looking at?

187
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:17,643
What do you want from me?

188
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,878
Looking for trouble, huh?

189
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:20,446
Are you paranoid?

190
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:22,648
I don't even know you.
Why am I looking for trouble with you?

191
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:23,883
-You didn't--
-Shut up!

192
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,852
-Give me the wallet!
-I said I didn't...

193
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,019
I don't have any money.

194
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,055
Give me the wallet.

195
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,457
I told you, I didn't take it.
Why would I lie to you?

196
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:33,593
Go on. Keep looking for it.

197
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,927
I really didn't do it.

198
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,096
-There's no wallet here.
-You threw the wallet away.

199
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,398
I have no money with me.

200
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,000
How could I steal her wallet or her money?

201
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,268
You already spent all the money.

202
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,971
-How could I spend it so fast--
-You two, stop it.

203
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,940
What am I supposed to do now?

204
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,380
I'm sorry
that I got the wrong idea about you.

205
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:56,582
This is not the point.

206
00:16:58,584 --> 00:16:59,819
What am I supposed to do now?

207
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,857
I mean, I don't know where I am
and I got no money on me.

208
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:06,893
It's not our concern if you have no money.

209
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,793
What?

210
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,129
Are you looking for sympathy?
Hoping we can give you some money?

211
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,364
What the heck are you looking at?

212
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:13,399
I'm telling you,
this is not going to work for me.

213
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,567
Get out!

214
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,135
Hey.

215
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,036
Go clean up your room.

216
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:19,305
It's fine with me. I'm that kind of guy
who can sleep anywhere.

217
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,108
-Even if I get it cleaned up, tomorrow--
-Clean up the room for her to sleep.

218
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,042
It's not for you.

219
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,544
-For who then?
-For her!

220
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:27,446
Hey, what are you looking at? Get out!

221
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:29,682
Get lost.

222
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:33,419
Stop looking.

223
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,398
I'm sorry.

224
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,732
What's your name?

225
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,501
Shancai.

226
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,702
Shancai.

227
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:54,106
My brother stole your wallet,

228
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,242
so I can't let you stay outside.

229
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,444
How about you stay here for now

230
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:00,680
while you wait for your friends
to pick you up?

231
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,271
Shancai.

232
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:27,640
Who's there?

233
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:32,845
It's Ah Mei.

234
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:36,182
Oh, come in, please.

235
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:40,820
Shancai.

236
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,022
Dinner is ready.
Would you like to join us?

237
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,224
No, thank you. I'm not hungry.

238
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,425
You can eat without me.

239
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:48,861
Then I'll save some for you.

240
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:51,497
Thank you.

241
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:59,438
Why is Ah De so dirty?

242
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:05,244
I'm sorry.

243
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,688
Shancai.

244
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:18,190
This is our address and phone number.

245
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:21,594
If your friends can't find the place,
just tell them to call us.

246
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,329
Thank you.

247
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:27,867
You don't have to be so polite.

248
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,568
I'm horrible at hosting.

249
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:33,239
If you need something just let me know.

250
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:34,840
And don't say "thank you."

251
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:36,542
Okay.

252
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,844
Come out and eat.

253
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:39,879
Okay.

254
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:40,966
DAOMING SI

255
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,258
Where would you like to go, miss?

256
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:10,629
You're acting weird.

257
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:12,464
Am I?

258
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:14,867
This is how drivers talk to their master.

259
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:17,036
I'm sorry.

260
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:20,239
You know that cellos are so fragile,

261
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:22,708
so I always sit in the back seat with it.

262
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:23,976
I'm sorry.

263
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,046
And...

264
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,415
could you please slow down a little bit?

265
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,417
Okay.

266
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,435
The scene is so beautiful here.

267
00:23:38,384 --> 00:23:39,785
It's so relaxing.

268
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,823
How about holding your concert here?

269
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:46,892
The atmosphere will be better.

270
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:50,829
No.

271
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:52,364
The riverside is too humid.

272
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:54,333
It's bad for the cello.

273
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:01,173
I think you should date your cello.

274
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:03,442
What do you mean?

275
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:08,147
I mean, you really love your cello.

276
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,154
When I was young,

277
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:17,423
I had a crush on a boy.

278
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:23,295
But before I could confess to him,

279
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:26,131
I was sent to study in America.

280
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,201
I missed him so much,

281
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:32,471
but I couldn't contact him.

282
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,575
Since I started learning cello,

283
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:40,612
I've been treating that cello like him.

284
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,883
Whenever I'm playing the cello,

285
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,253
I feel like I'm talking to him.

286
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,491
Did you look for him when you got back?

287
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:54,560
Have you met him?

288
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:07,373
We're dating now.

289
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,776
Aren't you worried
that I'll be jealous of your cello?

290
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:15,641
What's wrong with you?

291
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,677
You're not jealous of it anymore, right?

292
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,796
Come back here! What are you doing?

293
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:40,566
There's no need to get it!
We don't need it, okay?

294
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,701
Just come back here!

295
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,508
Don't you have any sense of humor?

296
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:02,855
You said you wouldn't jump into the water
to save Xiaociao,

297
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:05,090
but you jumped into the water
to save her cello.

298
00:27:06,692 --> 00:27:07,659
What happened to the cello?

299
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:08,994
Did it drown?

300
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:11,563
No.

301
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,132
It's waiting for an operation.

302
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:16,368
Lei.

303
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:19,004
Do you know anyone who can repair cellos?

304
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:20,873
Xiaociao really loves her cello.

305
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,207
I hope I can fix it for her.

306
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,945
As far as I know, there's only one man
who can repair cellos in Taiwan.

307
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:30,883
Xiaociao's cello should be safe
in his hands.

308
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:33,519
Great.

309
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:34,887
Do you know where he is?

310
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:36,688
We'll visit him tomorrow.

311
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,558
He often travels alone around Taiwan.

312
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:42,060
He looks for woods in different forests.

313
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:46,698
I heard that he has left Taipei recently.

314
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:49,268
That's okay.

315
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:53,438
It's pretty clear that Xiaociao chose you
rather than her cello.

316
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:57,309
Things will be much better
between you two without a rival.

317
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,545
Did I ask for your opinion?

318
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,948
Ah Si, he stole your line.

319
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,016
Aren't you going to protest?

320
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:06,118
What?

321
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:11,790
What's wrong?

322
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:12,858
What are you thinking about?

323
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:16,929
I'm so hungry right now.
Why don't we start eating dinner?

324
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:19,331
We're waiting for Shancai.
We'll serve the dishes when she arrives.

325
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,600
Why are we waiting for her?

326
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,572
That's strange.
Shancai is always punctual.

327
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,344
Did you call Shancai?

328
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:33,879
Yeah, I left a message on her phone.

329
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,985
Her phone is turned off.

330
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:41,653
Turned off again?

331
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:49,228
Hello, Mrs. Dong. I'm Meizuo.

332
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:50,495
Is Shancai there?

333
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:55,167
She went on a vacation?

334
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,138
Oh, thank you.

335
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,492
What is Shancai up to this time?

336
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:23,629
She went on a vacation without telling us.

337
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,071
Tired, maybe.

338
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,410
You're tired at this time?

339
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,814
I'm talking about Shancai.

340
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,852
I'm the one who is really tired
working as a chauffeur.

341
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:53,025
Shancai has been through a lot.

342
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,928
She has to serve Empress Dowager
at work in the day,

343
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,765
and she tries her best
to be Ah Si's friend.

344
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:05,704
They can never be friends.

345
00:30:10,876 --> 00:30:13,245
Relationship and friendship
can't co-exist.

346
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:28,460
Giving up on Ah Si isn't something
Shancai would do.

347
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:33,565
But Ah Si is in relationship
with Yesha now.

348
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,301
For someone like him,

349
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:39,338
it's impossible
that he'll come back to Shancai.

350
00:30:40,105 --> 00:30:41,139
Yeah.

351
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,109
Ah Si is still himself.

352
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:46,345
Whether or not he lost his memory,

353
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:48,513
he's always the Daoming Si we know.

354
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,456
Lei.

355
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,257
What do you think?

356
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,960
What can we do to help Shancai?

357
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,981
Probably nothing.

358
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,317
Shancai is hiding now,

359
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,619
so she wants us to do nothing at all.

360
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,529
Bartender, another beer.

361
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:11,329
Is this your wallet?

362
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,831
No.

363
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:21,173
AH MEI DESSERT SHOP

364
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,193
Shancai.

365
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,298
Shancai.

366
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:48,533
Are you sleeping?

367
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:51,870
Shancai.

368
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:18,463
-Excuse me.
-Would you like some shaved ice?

369
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,931
-Yeah.
-It's sold out.

370
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:22,634
Let's go to another shop.

371
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:29,207
-Excuse me.
-Would you like some shaved ice?

372
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:30,108
No.

373
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:32,377
Then why did you walk in here then?

374
00:33:34,613 --> 00:33:35,680
Why are you still here?

375
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:37,716
Even if you want some shaved ice,
it's already sold out.

376
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,184
Who is stopping you to buy some more?

377
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,685
Okay.

378
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:42,020
I'll order it now.

379
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:44,823
My shop will be long gone by the time
you finish your call. Sorry about that.

380
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:47,058
Ah Mei, I think you're best suited
to run the shop..

381
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:57,335
Why didn't you close the door?

382
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:01,172
Put the ice in the freezer.

383
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:08,346
Where is Shancai?

384
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,148
Went out for a walk again.

385
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,250
What do you mean by "again"?

386
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:16,488
She stayed in her room all day long.

387
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:17,989
I don't know what she was doing in there.

388
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,159
She must be out for a stroll.

389
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:22,961
I think she doesn't want to talk
to us at all.

390
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:27,332
You stole her wallet.

391
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,534
How could you complain about her?

392
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:32,671
I told you...

393
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:34,906
Okay, even if I did it,

394
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:36,741
don't you find it strange?

395
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:40,512
Has she ever told you when her friends
or family will pick her up?

396
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:42,347
No.

397
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:43,481
See what I mean?

398
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,122
Hey, slacking off again?

399
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:53,291
-Go put the ice cubes in the freezer.
-Okay.

400
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,295
I'm going to buy some fruits.

401
00:34:57,996 --> 00:34:59,397
There are tapioca pearls on the stove.

402
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:02,167
If they are burnt when I come back,
you're dead meat.

403
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:03,702
Fine, just go already, leave it to me.

404
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,271
-Don't drop the ice cubes on the ground.
-Okay, I know.

405
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,191
Ah Mei, what are you doing?

406
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:01,993
-Nothing.
-I see.

407
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:13,438
Shancai.

408
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:16,041
What are you doing here?

409
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:18,309
Nothing, I'm just looking around.

410
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,011
Then let's buy some fruits together,
shall we?

411
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:23,048
Come on. You got nothing to do anyway.

412
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,256
-Excuse me.
-What would you like?

413
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,024
How much is it?

414
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:34,325
It's 40 dollars for one pound.

415
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:36,795
-It's so expensive.
-It's not, considering how sweet it is.

416
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,330
This batch is very sweet.

417
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:43,401
Shancai, pick something you like.

418
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:48,173
This is sweeter than Hami melon.

419
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,374
The new batch is very sweet.

420
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,009
This is muskmelon.

421
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,944
This is cantaloupe.

422
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:55,046
There's another green one
called jade green.

423
00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:56,347
It's out of stock today.

424
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:57,916
This is pretty sweet.

425
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:01,820
Do you like strawberries?

426
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:04,155
Yeah.

427
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,392
These are imported
and they're very delicious.

428
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,161
-Want to taste one?
-Strawberries are expensive and sour now.

429
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,262
They're disgusting.

430
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:12,530
No, try some.

431
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,632
This is how strawberries are.

432
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:18,603
Sometimes they're so sweet
but sometimes they can be very sour.

433
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,573
Strawberries aren't that sour.

434
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:24,042
If you like sour fruits,
I'll take you to a place.

435
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:26,077
What place?

436
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:34,953
See that old house down there?

437
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,455
There's a river over there.

438
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:39,324
There are a lot of fishes
and shrimps in it.

439
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:45,830
Hey, taste one.

440
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:48,700
It's not poisonous.

441
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,005
It's so sour.

442
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:56,775
It's so sour that it can make you
tear up, right?

443
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:01,279
I was a very naughty kid.

444
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,414
I used to cause troubles everywhere.

445
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:05,483
My mom would beat me up
whenever I came back home.

446
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:09,587
But I was so weird.

447
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:11,322
No matter how hard my mom hit me,

448
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:12,590
I couldn't cry.

449
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:15,393
My mom thought I wasn't scared of her
because I didn't cry,

450
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,428
so she beat me even harder.

451
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:21,766
But it's so weird. The more pain I felt,
the less likely I could cry.

452
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,269
I had to figure out a way to deal with it.

453
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:26,938
When I knew I was going to get beat up,

454
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:28,506
I would come here to eat this berry.

455
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:30,708
Why?

456
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:34,913
Because it's so sour, it makes me cry.

457
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,016
Then I rushed home looking miserable,
so my mom wouldn't beat me.

458
00:38:39,184 --> 00:38:40,552
You were so naughty.

459
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,591
Being naughty is a privilege.

460
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,460
Since my mom passed away,

461
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,629
I didn't have to put on an act anymore.

462
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,798
It also put an end to my mischief.

463
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,339
But I still can't change my bad habit.

464
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:06,811
Sometimes, when I'm really upset
about something but I can't cry,

465
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:08,646
I will come here to eat this berry.

466
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:11,115
When my eyes are swollen like buns
from crying,

467
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,684
I will feel much better.

468
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:19,724
You're just like a friend of mine
who likes to stand upside down.

469
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:21,292
Stand upside down?

470
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,227
Yeah.

471
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:24,295
He said when he wants to cry,
he will stand upside down,

472
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:25,964
so his tears won't fall down.

473
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:33,271
Shancai.

474
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:39,844
You didn't call
your friends or family, right?

475
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,415
You don't have to answer me.

476
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:45,917
I'm not being nosy.

477
00:39:47,185 --> 00:39:48,553
I'm pretty dumb,

478
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,289
but I can tell
that you're not a bad person.

479
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:54,893
Life is easy here.

480
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:58,396
If you're in a bad mood,
you can live here as long as you like.

481
00:39:58,463 --> 00:39:59,497
No one will mind.

482
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:04,035
Anyway,

483
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,205
my brother will eventually get bored
and buzz off.

484
00:40:07,272 --> 00:40:08,673
I'll be living alone again.

485
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,876
It will be boring anyway, so I guess
two people are better than one, right?

486
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:18,016
It's so sour.

487
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,384
It's so sour, right?

488
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,993
-Really?
-She was really here.

489
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,728
-Ah Mei, you are back.
-Ah Mei is back.

490
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:32,864
Ah Mei.

491
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:35,500
Can't you skip a day of eating shaved ice?

492
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:37,602
But Dada is crazy for your douhua
with tapioca pearls,

493
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:39,404
-He can't even sleep.
-Yeah, me too.

494
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,505
It's none of your business.

495
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:43,074
-Ah Mei, let me help you.
-It's fine.

496
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:45,743
Shancai, just put the fruits back there.

497
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:46,644
Okay.

498
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:54,619
Huaze Lei.

499
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,793
Why are you here?

500
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,795
I came here to eat shaved ice.

501
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:10,802
Shancai.

502
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:13,438
Go pack your stuff up.

503
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:16,374
I've rented a house somewhere nearby.

504
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:20,578
He... Well, my friend...

505
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:21,512
Well...

506
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:22,814
Hurry up.

507
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:24,048
Okay.

508
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:32,490
Ah Mei, why do you keep holding
that watermelon?

509
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:41,566
Excuse me, are you Shancai's boyfriend?

510
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:43,067
No.

511
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:44,969
Then are you her brother?

512
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:46,704
No.

513
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:50,074
Please take your seat.

514
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:51,309
Okay, thank you.

515
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,244
Would you like some shaved ice?

516
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:54,912
I've already ordered one. Thank you.

517
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:57,882
Then how about some watermelon?

518
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:01,019
No, thank you. I'm all good here.

519
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,691
You left a little bit. Finish it.

520
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:12,663
Thank you.

521
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,941
Shancai.

522
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:27,378
-Your family is here to pick you up.
-Yeah. He's my friend.

523
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,548
How much is it?

524
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:31,549
It's on the house.

525
00:42:31,616 --> 00:42:33,217
You're Shancai's friend
so this one is on me.

526
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:35,119
I never let girls pay the bill.

527
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:37,055
Not bad.

528
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:38,089
Just like me.

529
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:40,024
How much is it?

530
00:42:40,425 --> 00:42:41,492
My wallet.

531
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,662
Someone found it on the train.

532
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,631
Did I hear something?

533
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,266
-Is this the wallet you lost?
-Yes.

534
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:52,904
See, I told you so many times
but you wouldn't believe me.

535
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,372
-Geez.
-I'm sorry, Ah De.

536
00:42:54,439 --> 00:42:56,307
I misunderstood you. I'm so sorry.

537
00:42:57,608 --> 00:42:59,010
Don't accuse me without proof, okay?

538
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,144
I'm sorry.

539
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:03,581
Here.

540
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:05,149
I'll get your change.

541
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:06,317
Keep the change.

542
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:11,522
I never owe my customers money.

543
00:43:17,128 --> 00:43:18,396
You're so cute.

544
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:23,901
Ah Mei, thank you for taking care of me.

545
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:25,837
I'll see you later.

546
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,038
I'm leaving now.

547
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:36,647
Ah Mei.

548
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:40,785
Get out of my way.

549
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:45,089
Hey, your change!

550
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:46,724
Ah Mei!

551
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,461
Get away from me!

552
00:43:50,528 --> 00:43:51,629
Are you okay?

553
00:43:53,598 --> 00:43:54,999
What a beautiful trail.

554
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:26,664
Do you like it?

555
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:32,970
You haven't told me how did you find me?

556
00:44:47,952 --> 00:44:49,020
HUAZE LEI

557
00:44:52,924 --> 00:44:54,725
I left Taipei secretly...

558
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,162
to find a place where no one knows me.

559
00:45:00,665 --> 00:45:01,999
Isn't this the place you want?

560
00:45:04,402 --> 00:45:05,770
The Shancai I know...

561
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:09,941
is the one who would scold F4
on the rooftop in Yingde University.

562
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:15,413
The one who will stand strong like a weed

563
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:18,382
when faced with difficulties.

564
00:45:18,616 --> 00:45:20,251
She will never give in.

565
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,593
This Shancai is hiding for now.

566
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:32,797
I know she's still here.

567
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:38,102
I believe I can find her very soon.

568
00:45:46,611 --> 00:45:48,179
Let's pick up your things and go inside.

569
00:47:13,798 --> 00:47:15,800
