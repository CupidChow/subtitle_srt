1
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:03,156
I'm pretty straightforward.

2
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,125
I guess I'll just get straight
to the point then.

3
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:08,395
I've decided to be your girlfriend.

4
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:16,803
What kind of reaction is that?

5
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:18,739
It's an honor
to have a girlfriend like me.

6
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,440
I'm telling you.
A lot of guys are pursuing me.

7
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,342
Get up. Ask them if you don't believe me.

8
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,217
Don't you know how many people
are pursuing Ah Mei?

9
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:31,852
Dada liked her for a long time too.

10
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:32,786
That's right.

11
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:34,888
Ah Mei is the most beautiful,

12
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:37,057
most popular,
and most courageous girl in our town.

13
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:38,959
You've got some nerve.

14
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,061
-What?
-You're...

15
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:42,329
-What?
-You're very lucky.

16
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:44,564
That's right, you're really lucky.

17
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:47,467
That's right. Dada is not as lucky as you.

18
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:48,902
That's right, you're lucky.

19
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:51,471
Did you hear that?

20
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,174
Did you hear that?

21
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,348
I'm not really interested in girls
that a lot of guys are pursuing.

22
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,118
You can't pursue me from now on.

23
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,853
I'll kick anyone who pursues me.
Do you hear me?

24
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,689
Did you hear me?

25
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:09,723
All right.

26
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,927
It's okay. Nobody's pursuing me now.

27
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:19,599
I'm also not interested with girls
that no one else likes.

28
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,402
Then what are you interested in?

29
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:23,937
Sleeping.

30
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,040
So are you rejecting me?

31
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:36,116
You're really cute.

32
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,452
You're even cuter today.

33
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:42,689
It's just that I'm not really interested
in you.

34
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,373
Ah Mei, actually, Lei is...

35
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,714
Wake up.

36
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,117
Why are you treating Ah Mei like that?

37
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,387
Go and pursue her.

38
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:16,723
Don't you like her?

39
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:21,461
Ah Mei.

40
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,331
Ah Mei!

41
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:26,933
Ah Mei.

42
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:36,176
Wake up.

43
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,314
Why are you here?

44
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,951
Do you want to be my girlfriend too?

45
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:47,354
That's okay.

46
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,256
But you have to be nicer.

47
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:51,191
What are you talking about?

48
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:52,659
Aren't you worried about Ah Mei?

49
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,161
She's going to be fine.

50
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,233
Don't you think Ah Mei is so brave?

51
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,539
Lei, how do you feel right now?

52
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,208
How do I feel about what?

53
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:09,676
About being confessed to.

54
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:11,778
Don't you think Ah Mei is cute?

55
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,850
I really admire her courage.

56
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:22,389
Wake up. You've been sleeping all day.

57
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,559
Lei, it's already late.

58
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:28,862
Are you a pig?

59
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:30,964
I'll go make some food.

60
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:47,614
Ah Mei.

61
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,651
-Ah Mei.
-What time is it?

62
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,153
What time is it now?

63
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,821
-Past 9:00 a.m.
-Past 9:00 a.m.

64
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:56,656
It's past 9:00 a.m.

65
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,760
Shouldn't you go to school then?

66
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:03,997
When do you want to graduate?

67
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:06,099
You guys don't know how blessed you are.

68
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,133
You're such a fool.

69
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,703
Go to school, you jerk.

70
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:12,873
Go.

71
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,577
I'll go to school then.

72
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:18,645
Who's stopping you?

73
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,051
Why are you looking back?

74
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:31,925
Go. Hurry!

75
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:57,083
What is he trying to say?

76
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,518
So what if he's handsome?

77
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,887
So what if he knows
how to play the violin?

78
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,157
His hair is too long.

79
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:05,425
He's too tall.

80
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:06,860
And he's always wearing white.

81
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,828
If he goes out at night,
he'll surely scare people.

82
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:10,797
He looks even scarier than a ghost.

83
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,603
His mouth is basically useless.

84
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,905
He doesn't talk. Is he mute?

85
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,109
He doesn't like me.

86
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,578
He rejected me. I'm rejecting him too.

87
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:27,681
How strange.

88
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:30,784
Reject me again.

89
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,619
Try to reject me again.

90
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:36,556
So what if he's handsome?

91
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,792
So what if he knows
how to play the violin?

92
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,694
Don't ever say I'm cute again.

93
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,862
Don't ever talk to me again.

94
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,165
If you tell me I'm cute again,
I'm going to blow your head off.

95
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,466
I'm going to blow your head off.

96
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:49,803
Don't ever stand beside me.

97
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,016
How petty.

98
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,185
Who's petty?

99
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,556
A girl who stops talking to a person
because she can't be his girlfriend

100
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:11,024
is the pettiest.

101
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,193
I'm not petty.

102
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,461
You're the one looking down on me.

103
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:15,895
Why should I talk to you?

104
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,565
Did I say I'm looking down on you?

105
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:19,599
You are looking down on me.

106
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,175
Hey.

107
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:35,749
If you don't like me
because you like someone else,

108
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:36,983
I can accept that.

109
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,085
But if you don't like anyone

110
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,320
and you still don't like me,

111
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:41,921
isn't that considered
as looking down on me?

112
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,993
You look so cute.

113
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,830
Stop telling me that I'm cute.

114
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,033
You say I'm cute,
but you still don't love me.

115
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,604
You're a playboy and a flirt, Huaze Lei.

116
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,408
You don't love me either,

117
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,309
yet you want to be my girlfriend.

118
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:05,712
So you're also a playgirl.

119
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,482
And a flirt with a big face.

120
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:14,754
Who said I don't love you?

121
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,756
Then tell me three reasons
why you love me.

122
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,725
-Three?
-Yes.

123
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,531
You said I'm cute.

124
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,936
You don't have a girlfriend.

125
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,677
Your hand is very beautiful.

126
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,251
Is that love?

127
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,353
What else would it be?

128
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,457
That's like, not love.

129
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,594
To be in love,
you must understand each other.

130
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:57,964
I don't get it.

131
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,412
Take a look at my hand.

132
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:19,319
You have a good life.

133
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,021
Look closer.

134
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:26,960
There are a lot of calluses.

135
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:28,394
Yes.

136
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:34,601
So now you know my hand
is not that beautiful.

137
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,376
When I was little,
I really loved the sound of the violin.

138
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,848
And I was very curious about it.

139
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,318
How can that weird-shaped box

140
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,655
produce such a nice sound?

141
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,359
So I started studying how to play it.

142
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:02,829
First, the skin

143
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,032
peeled off of my fingertips.

144
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,668
Then it bled.

145
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,571
Finally, it developed calluses.

146
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,909
It was a painful process.

147
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:19,946
And it made me want to give up.

148
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,619
But the more I understand the pain
of learning the violin,

149
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,524
the harder it was for me to give it up.

150
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:36,596
Because I fell in love with it.

151
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,505
Do you understand it now?

152
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:49,576
You like me.

153
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:51,411
I love the violin.

154
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:57,917
I still don't get it.

155
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,624
I don't know if you're talking
about the violin

156
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:07,827
or Shancai.

157
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,968
Of course it's Shancai.

158
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:31,317
You like Shancai, right?

159
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,326
Because you like Shancai,

160
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:43,029
you became friends with her.

161
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:48,935
And the more you understand Shancai,
the harder it was for you to give her up.

162
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,573
That's why you go wherever she goes.

163
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:57,744
Because...

164
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:02,782
Because you fell in love
with Shancai, right?

165
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,498
If you're rejecting me
because you love Shancai,

166
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:25,905
I feel like I'll be happy with that.

167
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:40,019
You're in pain because of Shancai, right?

168
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,425
You love Shancai, right?

169
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,998
You're an indecisive man, aren't you?

170
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:54,701
Good thing I don't like you that much.

171
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,145
The answer is not there.

172
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,582
The answer is over here.

173
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:56,789
Sha.

174
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:00,827
I have good bottle of wine.

175
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,168
1995 Spanish Collection.

176
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:15,708
I feel so happy.

177
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,479
Do you want to ask Yesha
to come and share this happiness?

178
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,147
Sha.

179
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:25,785
I opened this wine for us.

180
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,590
I see.

181
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:34,460
She'll finish this quickly if she sees it.
And that won't be good for us.

182
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,930
So let us handsome guys enjoy this.

183
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,002
Tell me.

184
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:47,540
I regained my memories.

185
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:50,943
You regained your memories?

186
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:52,512
Everything?

187
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,387
The days from when I woke up
at the hospital

188
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:08,227
feels like a very long sleep.

189
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:14,100
Suddenly, it's like...

190
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:18,838
everything just happened yesterday.

191
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,176
I remember everything.

192
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:34,487
Including my love for Shancai.

193
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,632
I clearly know

194
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:50,937
that the one I love is Shancai.

195
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:54,140
You can't do this.
You can't love Yesha then--

196
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,108
This is not something I can control.

197
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,380
I also want to have just one memory.

198
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,250
It doesn't matter if it only
has Shancai or Yesha.

199
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:07,119
Why can't I have just one memory?

200
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,324
Why is God playing this trick on me?

201
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,426
I don't know what I should do.

202
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:14,794
No matter what I do,

203
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,762
I'll hurt someone I love.

204
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,932
I'm trying hard
to get my feelings for Yesha back.

205
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:25,404
I want to love Yesha.

206
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,176
But as my feelings get clearer,

207
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,079
I feel more guilty when Yesha

208
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:36,916
treats me nicely.

209
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,720
How can I lie to Yesha?

210
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,222
Sha, tell me. How can I lie to Yesha?

211
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,124
You can.

212
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:47,326
You should lie to her.

213
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:50,730
Sha.

214
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,967
Don't you want Yesha
to have real happiness?

215
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,772
You are her happiness.

216
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,447
Do you know

217
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,451
how much she sacrificed

218
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,489
to bring you and Shancai together?

219
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,493
I came back from Spain

220
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:23,396
with this ring.

221
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,866
Yet your ring was stolen.

222
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,402
She was worried and scared

223
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:32,471
that the curse mentioned
in the legend would happen to you.

224
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:35,841
So she kept this ring with her.

225
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,780
She loves you.

226
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:44,450
Yet she wants to give you back to Shancai.

227
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,455
She'd rather have you misunderstand her.

228
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:53,259
She'd rather bear all the pain.

229
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:56,462
And secretly cry in a corner.

230
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,335
Because she's sick.

231
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,006
She's dying.

232
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,543
What did you say?

233
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:16,682
Three months.

234
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,352
Maybe half a year.

235
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:26,759
Yet she used the time she has left

236
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:29,562
to make a deal with your mom.

237
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,265
So that Shancai can stay beside you.

238
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,503
So that you can regain your memories
and be together with her.

239
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:42,208
Then she plans
to peacefully face her own death.

240
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:51,450
She sacrificed so much for you, you know?

241
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:03,162
But that day,
when she saved you from the pool,

242
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,398
that's when she completely broke down.

243
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:09,735
She completely broke down.

244
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:14,473
God can take her life away

245
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:18,210
but He can't take her love for you away.

246
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:31,290
She just decided
to love you no matter what.

247
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:37,963
Ah Xing, I'm begging you.

248
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:40,132
I'm begging you.

249
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,434
I'm selfish.

250
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:44,436
I'm not that kind.

251
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,305
I feel sorry for you and Shancai.

252
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,941
But I'm begging you.

253
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:53,979
I'm begging you.
Please continue loving Yesha, okay?

254
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,254
Ah Xing, promise me.

255
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:07,960
Ah Xing.

256
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,029
Ah Xing!

257
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,936
I'm so hungry.

258
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,906
I must have forgotten to eat
because I was concentrating too much.

259
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:56,876
Do you want to eat something?

260
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:03,082
I'm fine.

261
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,453
I was just sitting down for too long.

262
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:12,925
Let's go.

263
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,366
It hurts.

264
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:22,835
What's the matter?

265
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:24,503
It hurts.

266
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:27,706
Painkillers.

267
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:38,951
Yesha, where's your medicine?

268
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:40,586
It's in the cabinet.

269
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:30,536
Didn't you say...

270
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:35,441
that you won't hide anything
from me anymore?

271
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:40,212
Why didn't you tell me?

272
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:44,984
I'm sorry.

273
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,024
I'll take you to the best doctor.

274
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:57,229
You are the best doctor.

275
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,134
I don't like hospitals.

276
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:06,405
I don't like being intubated.

277
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:12,344
I just want to spend
the remaining days of my life

278
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:14,580
loving you.

279
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,414
Do you blame me for being so selfish?

280
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:54,920
Someone who doesn't stand a chance
is still clinging on to you.

281
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,024
Then I will be gone one day,

282
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:01,827
leaving nothing behind.

283
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,297
Memories.

284
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:08,567
What?

285
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,638
You'll leave memories with me.

286
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,110
No one can take that away, right?

287
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,381
Yesha.

288
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:25,717
When are we going
to travel around the world?

289
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:42,034
You don't know how happy I am.

290
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:49,608
I don't want to give you back
to Shancai anymore.

291
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:08,760
Ah Xing.

292
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,364
Thank you.

293
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,847
<i>I don't like hospitals.</i>

294
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,785
<i>I don't like being intubated.</i>

295
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:45,691
<i>I just want to spend
the remaining days of my life</i>

296
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:48,026
<i>loving you.</i>

297
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:26,131
Just put more aiyu jelly.

298
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,267
Shouldn't you order aiyu jelly then?

299
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:37,709
Why are there so many people
ordering dessert today?

300
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,244
Dada's not here.

301
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:43,448
Here.

302
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:44,583
Ah De.

303
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,053
Ah De!

304
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:07,139
Darn you, Ah De!

305
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:09,007
See what I'll do
if you don't come out now!

306
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,692
Here, this is your dessert.

307
00:30:28,794 --> 00:30:30,862
-I'm going to make some grass jelly.
-Okay.

308
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:46,144
Guys, I'm sorry.

309
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:49,281
We're closing early today.
Can you have your dessert for takeout?

310
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,049
I'm not done eating yet.

311
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:54,353
All right. Your dessert's on me today.
You don't have to pay.

312
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,288
No, I want to finish it here.
I don't want to leave.

313
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:57,756
Please, okay?

314
00:30:57,823 --> 00:30:59,658
I'll add more ingredients and ice, okay?

315
00:30:59,725 --> 00:31:01,993
-Who does business this way?
-Tell me what you want me to add.

316
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,662
Please, we really have an emergency today.

317
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:04,996
Thank you.

318
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:08,300
Come on, tell me what you like.

319
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:09,901
I'll add them. Come on.

320
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,313
We were so busy earlier.
Why isn't there anybody here now?

321
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,981
They left after they've finished eating.

322
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,184
It's because you're too fierce.
You scared all the customers away.

323
00:31:26,752 --> 00:31:27,786
I'm too fierce?

324
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:30,489
You look 100 times fiercer than me, okay?

325
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,924
I look nice when I'm fierce,
but you don't.

326
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:34,726
I don't look nice when I'm fierce?

327
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,463
Business doesn't seem to be good today.

328
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:40,065
Yeah, it's not.

329
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:42,501
Good timing.

330
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,269
Shancai wants you to have dinner with us.

331
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:45,971
Really? That's great.

332
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:47,272
I happen to be hungry.

333
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:48,640
I want to earn money. I can't go.

334
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:53,445
All right then.

335
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,647
Ah De, let's go.

336
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:57,048
Okay.

337
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:59,084
I'll go have dinner.

338
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:02,354
Hey.

339
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:04,956
What are you eating?

340
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,466
Why does your house look like this?

341
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:19,905
What are you guys talking about?

342
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:22,974
Nothing. Be careful. Don't fall again.

343
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:26,645
What are we eating today?

344
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,246
There are many delicious dishes.

345
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:31,817
Shancai.

346
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:35,787
-Where's Shancai?
-I don't know.

347
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:37,556
Shancai.

348
00:32:49,868 --> 00:32:50,969
Is there a power outage?

349
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:55,774
Why don't you turn on the lights?

350
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:57,776
I don't know.

351
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:00,645
Why are there so many candles?

352
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:08,487
Happy Birthday!

353
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,356
Happy Birthday.

354
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:13,859
<i>Happy Birthday to you</i>

355
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:17,062
<i>Happy Birthday to you</i>

356
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:19,764
<i>Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday</i>

357
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,667
<i>Happy Birthday to you</i>

358
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:26,037
Make a wish.

359
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:28,273
I wish...

360
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,543
I wish for someone
that can watch the dessert shop with me.

361
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:38,550
I wish that everyone who's lost their way
could get back on track someday.

362
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:39,618
You...

363
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,654
And I wish...

364
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:44,623
This one's a secret.

365
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:47,726
-All right. Blow the candles.
-Blow the candles.

366
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,429
Help her.

367
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,699
Yes!

368
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:57,636
Ah Mei, happy birthday to you.

369
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,304
This is your birthday gift.

370
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:01,506
Open it now.

371
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:06,845
Oh.

372
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:12,584
Where did this come from?

373
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:15,987
I bought this, of course.

374
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:18,623
You're lying. Where did you get
the money to buy this?

375
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:22,260
I really bought this.

376
00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:23,828
I swear, okay?

377
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,898
Nine out of ten
of your promises aren't true.

378
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,467
Tell me. Where you did you buy this?

379
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,002
When did you buy this?

380
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,470
How much is it?

381
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:36,641
Why don't you believe anything that I say?

382
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:42,514
Am I that useless to you?

383
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:49,321
Then tell me. Where did you buy this?

384
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:04,002
Ah De really bought this ring.
I'm a witness.

385
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:06,538
I was with him when he bought it.

386
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:11,843
Ah Mei.

387
00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:14,813
Regardless what Ah De did before

388
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,748
and how much he had hurt you,

389
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:19,784
have you ever thought
about who else in this world

390
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,287
would remember your birthday this well?

391
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:26,424
Who's willing to work hard
just to let you have a good birthday?

392
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:32,197
Who wants to give you a gift
even if people misunderstand him?

393
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:34,466
You know,

394
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:37,469
I'm really jealous that you have
a brother who loves you so much.

395
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:41,940
Who says he loves me?

396
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,444
He left the dessert shop
to me without a word.

397
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,614
I always have bad dreams

398
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,485
that he got killed, hurt,
or caught by the police.

399
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:58,156
When my mom left, she left nothing.

400
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,558
Nothing but a troublemaker like him.

401
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:05,964
I don't want him to take care of me.

402
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,001
He just needs
to take good care of himself.

403
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,509
I just want him to be a good person.

404
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:20,879
Who doesn't steal or rob from anyone.

405
00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:32,557
What are you doing? That's my ring.

406
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,824
Actually, it looks quite good.

407
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,761
Even on my claw-like hand.

408
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:58,510
Shancai, thank you.

409
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:00,578
You don't have to thank me.

410
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,916
But can you tell me the truth?

411
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,989
I thought you considered me as your friend
that's why you defended me.

412
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,825
Turns out you also think I'm a thief.

413
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:14,959
I don't.

414
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,296
But that ring was mine before.

415
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,064
It was yours?

416
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:21,933
I get it now.

417
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:24,736
You mean I stole your wallet
and your ring.

418
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:28,006
Don't forget that you've already
falsely accused me once.

419
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,507
Can you not accuse me again?

420
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:31,776
If you want to accuse me,
please present some proof.

421
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:36,014
That ring cannot be bought
anywhere in Taiwan.

422
00:38:36,381 --> 00:38:37,882
It came from Barcelona.

423
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:41,853
I have a friend
who brought it back from Barcelona.

424
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:45,089
Then a thief stole it

425
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,891
from an old house.

426
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,104
That's impossible.

427
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:04,242
That kind of coincidence is impossible.

428
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,377
That's impossible.

429
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:09,214
Ah De, I won't tell anyone.

430
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,650
For Ah Mei's sake, I won't say anything.

431
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:16,688
I just want to confirm if it is my ring.

432
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:21,426
Because that ring is very important to me.

433
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:26,431
It made me lose the one I love
and it changed my life.

434
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,466
That ring pushed me off the cliff.

435
00:39:29,434 --> 00:39:32,904
I'm hiding here
and trying to forget everything

436
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:35,440
because of that ring.

437
00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:39,010
Then God lead me to it again.

438
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:42,280
Ah De.

439
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,282
Is that my ring?

440
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:48,586
Ah De.

441
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:05,536
Shancai, I'm sorry.

442
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:12,110
Ah De.

443
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:14,178
Ah De, I'm so dizzy.

444
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:16,514
I think I should drive you home.

445
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:17,515
No.

446
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:19,183
Why did you drink so much?

447
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,586
I have a bad headache.
Why are you two chatting over there?

448
00:40:21,653 --> 00:40:22,820
Ah Mei, are you all right?

449
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,189
How weird. Shancai's my friend.
So why are you two talking?

450
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,224
Okay, fine.

451
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:28,393
-Don't talk to him. He's a bad influence.
-All right, I know.

452
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:29,527
I have a bad headache.

453
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,195
Are you okay?
You shouldn't drink that much.

454
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,330
I'm going home.

455
00:40:32,397 --> 00:40:33,464
Lei, take them home.

456
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:35,199
-That's right.
-No, don't.

457
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,968
-We'll go home by ourselves.
-It's fine.

458
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:38,636
Ah De, crouch down.

459
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:40,471
How can I go home
if you don't crouch down?

460
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:41,372
Fine.

461
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,374
How would I walk if I'm dizzy or tired?

462
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,909
-I know.
-All right.

463
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:46,778
Your wine is so good.

464
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:48,780
-Come again next time. Be careful.
-Okay.

465
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,081
Ah De, be careful.

466
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:51,749
Be careful.

467
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:53,885
Bye.

468
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:56,054
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

469
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,121
Bye.

470
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:58,389
Be careful.

471
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:02,694
Shancai told you to be careful.

472
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:15,106
<i>After the entire summer,
I saw the meteor ring again.</i>

473
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,743
<i>However, it seems like it's not meant
meant for me.</i>

474
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:23,281
<i>Daoming Si and my story is over anyway.</i>

475
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:27,685
<i>The meteor ring is meaningful
and irreplaceable to Ah Mei now.</i>

476
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,357
<i>But what should we do</i>

477
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:33,691
<i>about that unlucky legend?</i>

478
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:14,065
Hurry.

479
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:19,470
I'm really going to faint.

480
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,205
I'm really going to faint.

481
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:25,176
Great news.

482
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:27,945
I think this is

483
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:31,249
really great news.

484
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:35,753
The hospital said...

485
00:42:39,991 --> 00:42:41,259
They found a bone marrow.

486
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:46,664
Really?

487
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:02,647
There's a good match between the
donor's bone marrow and yours.

488
00:43:03,014 --> 00:43:07,118
But the precise matching process
needs to be done in Hong Kong.

489
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,988
We can get the results in a week
or in a month at the latest.

490
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,391
Just go back and wait for the results.

491
00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:16,527
Then what can we do while we're waiting?

492
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:18,229
As usual,

493
00:43:18,396 --> 00:43:20,832
take your medicines on time
and maintain a healthy lifestyle.

494
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:24,569
The most important thing is to relax
and wait for our good news.

495
00:43:27,305 --> 00:43:28,606
Doctor, excuse me.

496
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:31,542
You can stay here. I'll go ahead.

497
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:35,546
We need to prepare for surgery.

498
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:40,184
What's the matter? Do you feel tired?

499
00:43:43,888 --> 00:43:46,057
I've originally decided
to live for just three more months.

500
00:43:46,691 --> 00:43:48,292
But now I'm reluctant
to leave because of you.

501
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:51,162
Now, I want to live three more years.

502
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:52,797
Thirty more years.

503
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:55,800
Three hundred more years, for you.

504
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,783
Mr. Qiu.

505
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:14,819
Qiu Zhengde.

506
00:44:15,353 --> 00:44:17,121
Come with us to the police station.

507
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:19,557
Why should he go with you?

508
00:44:20,224 --> 00:44:22,160
Did he commit a crime by sleeping at home?

509
00:44:22,527 --> 00:44:24,695
Some incidents seem to be related
to Mr. Qiu Zhengde.

510
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:26,164
We're taking him for questioning.

511
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,565
Let's go, take him.

512
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:30,001
Wait.

513
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,437
Didn't you promise me already?

514
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:36,774
Speak.

515
00:44:38,276 --> 00:44:39,844
I really made up my mind to be good.

516
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:42,046
All right. We'll talk at the station.

517
00:44:42,113 --> 00:44:43,381
Let's go, take him.

518
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:45,283
Ah Mei.

519
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:01,933
Ah Mei. Why did Ah De
get in the police car?

520
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:03,601
That's none of your business.
Go to school.

521
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:10,107
-But the car's leaving--
-I told you to go to school.

522
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:13,144
Go!

523
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:15,232
