1
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:23,610
Shancai.

2
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,213
Shancai!

3
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:31,585
Shancai.

4
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:35,188
Shancai, are you home?

5
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,248
What are you doing?

6
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,450
Leave me alone. What are you doing?

7
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:06,787
What are you up to, Lei? Let me go!

8
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:15,595
To be honest,

9
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,998
I don't know if I did it.

10
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,502
Maybe I've done a lot of bad things.

11
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:23,937
So...

12
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,678
I also want to be a good man.

13
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:34,514
Just like you.

14
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:37,951
But you can't imagine how hard it is

15
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:44,157
to change into a good person
after being bad.

16
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:09,883
Well...

17
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,954
Could you please do me a favor?

18
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:17,724
When you leave,

19
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:21,595
could you please make her vent on you?

20
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,966
After she vents out her anger,

21
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,068
her mood will improve.

22
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,773
Or you can scold me for her.

23
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,075
The harsher you scold me, the better.

24
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,444
The more people dislike me,

25
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,047
the less likely she will dislike me.

26
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,553
And...

27
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:51,858
I know she might not be the kind of girl
you'll have feelings for.

28
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,962
But could you please be her friend?

29
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,501
Or could you be like a brother to her?

30
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,338
She would be very happy...

31
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:11,144
if she would have a brother like you.

32
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,583
You're the brother she deserves.

33
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:20,587
Please.

34
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,396
What have I done in my past life
to deserve this kind of brother?

35
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,231
What a douchebag.

36
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,166
A complete douchebag!

37
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,068
An excellent douchebag!

38
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,873
It's so lucky for a douchebag like him
to end up in prison.

39
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:41,875
At least he won't be killed.

40
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:44,377
Good job.

41
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,046
Great job.

42
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,315
I hope they lock you up for a long time,

43
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,517
so I can live an easier life.

44
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:52,586
For a long time!

45
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,224
Mom.

46
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,526
I'm so relieved now.

47
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,562
I'm truly relieved.

48
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,700
All this scolding makes me tired.
I'll take a rest now.

49
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:28,622
Don't cry.

50
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:45,839
I consulted the lawyer.

51
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:48,875
Ah De is a first-time offender.

52
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,210
Without enough evidence,

53
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,479
he can be bailed out now.

54
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,683
That is if he doesn't commit another crime
during the probation period.

55
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,220
The heaviest sentence
will be commutation to fines.

56
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:06,793
We need professional lawyers
to take care of legal affairs.

57
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,729
Find lawyers to help him get away
with the crime?

58
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:10,864
It's a no from me.

59
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:13,600
Bad people should be punished

60
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,269
in order for them to know what is right
and what is wrong.

61
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,005
He's not a bad person.

62
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:22,442
Ah De has already had his punishment.

63
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,978
What he needs now is a chance.

64
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:27,447
You need money to obtain that chance.

65
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:28,782
Unfortunately, I don't have money.

66
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:32,352
I do.

67
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,688
Congratulations.

68
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:35,889
Ah Mei.

69
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:42,929
I've already said it.

70
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:44,965
I don't have money.

71
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,433
I don't have chances, too.

72
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,169
There's no need to make the effort
for that kind of people.

73
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,005
He is your brother.

74
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,740
So it's none of your business.

75
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:02,382
I've only found out today

76
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:06,820
that your stubbornness is not cute at all.

77
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,348
CASE REPORT DESK

78
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,859
I don't want to owe other people anything,

79
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:54,861
especially favors.

80
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,331
If you'll lend me money,

81
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,533
I can put up my shop as collateral.

82
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:07,874
What will I do with your dessert shop?

83
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,046
Forget it.

84
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:16,182
If you have to put something up
as collateral,

85
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,320
there's one thing I want.

86
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,595
What kind of friends are you two?

87
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:30,930
Hey, Ah Si.

88
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,532
What are you thinking?

89
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:37,237
If I stayed silent and didn't call you
to meet me,

90
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,839
would you really only focus
on your girlfriend and neglect me?

91
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:41,774
How am I only focusing on my girlfriend?

92
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,343
I'm Meizuo, your driver.

93
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,613
One moment, you are practicing violin.
The next time, you go to rural areas.

94
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,582
You're dating no matter where you are.

95
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,685
I went there to meet Lei.

96
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,388
Meet Lei?

97
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,124
What is he doing there?

98
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:02,162
He just called me today.
He told me to find lawyers for him.

99
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,563
I asked him what was it about.

100
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,731
He just said it was nothing.

101
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,434
Did something happen to Shancai?

102
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,471
What do you mean?

103
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:13,573
Lei is there with Shancai, right?

104
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:15,975
Lei...

105
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:17,877
went there to accompany her.

106
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:22,448
Great.

107
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,817
Whatever happens to Shancai,

108
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,219
Lei can get things covered.

109
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:33,726
Ah Si.

110
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,529
You're in a stable relationship
with Yesha now.

111
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:37,697
What's your future plan?

112
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,834
I don't want you to lose to Meizuo
in wedding.

113
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,204
Hey, don't drag me into this.

114
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:46,806
I won't marry someone
who doesn't love me, okay?

115
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:48,508
Hold on.

116
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:50,944
You said Ying Xiaociao doesn't love you.

117
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:53,146
I thought it's you who doesn't love her?

118
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:56,983
I got you.

119
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:02,422
Right.

120
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,457
Has Xiaoyou called you recently?

121
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:05,992
Don't avoid my question.

122
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,761
So, what you mean is,

123
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,697
you have fallen in love
with Ying Xiaociao,

124
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,232
but you don't know if she loves you.

125
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:17,804
Is it true that love makes people stupid?

126
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:21,174
Everyone can see
that she wants to marry you.

127
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,408
Of course, she loves you.

128
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,613
She loves the same social status, not me.

129
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:29,782
Are you an idiot?

130
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,885
How can you be our driver?

131
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:39,659
Ah Si.

132
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,060
You are so Ah Si.

133
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,133
This is the Ah Si I know.

134
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:50,470
I mean,

135
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:52,705
you can just go ask her.

136
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,908
Why do you waste your time guessing?

137
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,580
You scared me for a moment.
I thought you've regained your memory.

138
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:07,353
Don't you want me to regain my memory?

139
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:13,960
Why does the idea of me
regaining my memory scare you?

140
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,196
That's not what I meant.

141
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,133
I meant, if you've really regained
your memory,

142
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,834
things might get more complicated.

143
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:23,670
More complicated?

144
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:26,406
What things?

145
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:32,111
You and Yesha. Lei and Shancai.

146
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:39,185
You mean, Shancai and Lei...

147
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,721
I'm not sure about it.

148
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,691
But they've always had
that special relationship, right?

149
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:49,429
I just want to say,
if Lei and Shancai are truly in love,

150
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:53,466
at least everyone is happy,

151
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:54,801
and there won't be regrets.

152
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,204
You're right.

153
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:00,006
To Lei and Shancai.

154
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,475
Ah Si.

155
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,377
I'm tired. I'm leaving now.

156
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,314
Ah Si.

157
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,794
<i>If Lei and Shancai are truly in love,</i>

158
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:25,732
<i>at least everyone is happy,</i>

159
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:29,202
<i>and there won't be regrets.</i>

160
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:01,601
Young Master.

161
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:06,038
-Where's Yesha?
-She's in her room.

162
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:13,513
Yesha.

163
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,747
You're perfectly on time.

164
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:16,616
Are you here to check
if I took my medicine?

165
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:42,909
This one will let me live
three more months for Ah Xing.

166
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:54,320
This one will let me live
three more years for Ah Xing.

167
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,637
This one will let me live
300 more years for Ah Xing.

168
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:16,075
Now I can live for 300 years.

169
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,845
Silly, hurry up and go to sleep.

170
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,347
Any bedtime stories tonight?

171
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:25,284
I'm bad at telling stories.
Please don't make me do this.

172
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,753
Then you can kiss me instead.

173
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:35,661
You should go to bed early.

174
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:38,331
Ah Xing.

175
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,102
Thank you.

176
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:46,939
Silly, hurry up and go to sleep.

177
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,332
Did you find Shancai?

178
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:20,339
What do I do if I find her?

179
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,310
I was thinking,

180
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,314
we can lie to Yesha,

181
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,650
but you can't lie to Shancai.

182
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:55,274
Oh, geez.

183
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:01,380
I don't know what's right
and what's wrong anymore.

184
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:20,453
Why are you standing there?

185
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:21,987
Step over the fire pit.

186
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,297
Bad luck goes away. Good luck comes in.

187
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:32,998
The past stays in the past.

188
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,533
It's a fresh start for everything.

189
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,171
Eat up all the noodles.

190
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,439
Don't leave anything.

191
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:11,137
Mom.

192
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:13,873
My brother came back.

193
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:17,243
He will take good care of me.

194
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,211
Don't worry.

195
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:56,949
I miss home.

196
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:02,888
You should go back to Taipei.

197
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:05,991
Yeah.

198
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:07,760
Tomorrow.

199
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:15,534
Shancai.

200
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:18,771
I have something to return to you.

201
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:21,774
So you owe me something, too?

202
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:23,809
I thought I was the one
who always owed you.

203
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:36,121
How did it end up in your hands?

204
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:38,591
Because it's important to you.

205
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:43,762
Lei.

206
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:47,666
This is an exchange between Ah Mei and me.

207
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:49,602
This way, she'll be relieved.

208
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,447
But the story of this ring has ended.

209
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,250
It has really ended now.

210
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:51,230
The story of Jing and me has ended, too.

211
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,391
There is one story ending in every second.

212
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:23,796
There is one story starting, too.

213
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:36,475
Shancai.

214
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:42,982
Go to Japan with me.

215
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:47,886
Do you get what I mean?

216
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,111
Lei.

217
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,347
No rush. I'll be waiting for you.

218
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,133
What took you so long?

219
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,134
Let's eat.

220
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,636
It smells so good.

221
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:20,672
How is it? My sister's cooking skill
is well matched with yours, right?

222
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,708
-Of course.
-Only the two of you?

223
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:24,076
Who else?

224
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,711
And your friend.

225
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,179
He just went here looking for you.

226
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:28,780
Friend?

227
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:30,582
Is that Meizuo?

228
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:33,051
No. Meizuo is much cuter.

229
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:35,954
This one looks pretty good,
but he is so rude.

230
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:37,756
He even wouldn't tell me his name.

231
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:39,324
All he asked was, "Where did Shancai go?"

232
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:41,560
I said you two might have gone for a walk.

233
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:43,428
He didn't even say thank you
before he ran away.

234
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,364
Of course, he wouldn't say
thank you to you.

235
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,799
Judging by your appearance,
he must have thought you're a maid.

236
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,835
I'm a maid? What are you? A slave?

237
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:50,869
I...

238
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,941
Who was it?

239
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:00,078
It was Ah Si.

240
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:26,365
Lei!

241
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:32,571
Daoming Si.

242
00:29:40,012 --> 00:29:41,346
Ah Si wants to speak to you.

243
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:43,015
I'm leaving now.

244
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:45,617
What?

245
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:48,353
You're repaying me
for that match I tanked, right?

246
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,688
The match isn't over yet.

247
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,033
I just wanted to check on you.

248
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:06,405
I'm leaving now.

249
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:08,006
I am so disappointed.

250
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:15,614
I thought Ah Si, who regained his memory,

251
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,353
would get his courage back
and finish that match.

252
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,093
I didn't know...

253
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:34,299
that you would give up the opportunity
of catching the last ball.

254
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:38,103
Lei.

255
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:40,539
What are you talking about?

256
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:42,040
I don't understand you.

257
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:43,942
Shancai.

258
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,411
Have you forgotten?

259
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,117
Ah Si planned to kick us out of Yingde
with a match.

260
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:54,619
That match isn't over yet.

261
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:56,321
The match is over!

262
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,201
Because I've chosen to...

263
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:17,376
give up.

264
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:20,245
Daoming Si.

265
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:24,883
Have you really regained your memory?

266
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:30,355
Ah Si.

267
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,060
The ball is in Shancai's hands.

268
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:38,930
Will you still choose to give up?

269
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:15,233
Have you really regained your memory?

270
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,811
The moment I woke up in the hospital,

271
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:32,651
I saw you lying by my bed.

272
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:36,221
I was so happy.

273
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:40,926
I wanted to stretch out my arm
to reach you.

274
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,032
But the face in front of me wasn't yours.

275
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:53,805
I remembered everything.

276
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:58,376
You.

277
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:03,081
Yesha.

278
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:08,854
I didn't know what to do.

279
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,093
I couldn't see you.

280
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:20,232
But I remembered you more and more.

281
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:24,603
Laughing.

282
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:27,105
Crying.

283
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:30,809
And scolding me.

284
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,147
It became surer

285
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:39,217
and clearer...

286
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,525
how much I love you.

287
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:53,198
Should I hide my feelings?

288
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,570
Or should I be honest with myself?

289
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:03,475
I didn't know.

290
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:08,513
There's only one person
who can give me the answer.

291
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:14,085
That's why I went here.

292
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,123
But...

293
00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:22,627
I'm the third wheel between you and Lei.

294
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:25,430
Daoming Si.

295
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,671
Shancai.

296
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,875
Has our story really ended?

297
00:34:47,986 --> 00:34:49,120
Can you accept it?

298
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:54,059
No.

299
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:02,767
But even so, what can we do?

300
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:06,304
Ever since we first met,

301
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:09,174
it seems that we have been cursed.

302
00:35:12,077 --> 00:35:13,078
Daoming Si.

303
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,515
Is it true that fate won't allow us
to be together?

304
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:20,986
Are we really fated to hurt Yesha and Lei?

305
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:23,021
Fate?

306
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:24,956
You tell me where that fate is.

307
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:28,126
Tell me where that fate is! Come out!

308
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,961
I'll beat you up!

309
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:32,464
Why are you doing this to me and Shancai?

310
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:43,074
Daoming Si.

311
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:44,876
Do you remember?

312
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:49,748
That night on your balcony,

313
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:54,319
the meteor marked the start of our love.

314
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,759
Maybe the meteor is our fate.

315
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,766
Maybe the meteor is our answer.

316
00:36:13,238 --> 00:36:14,239
Daoming Si.

317
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:17,876
If we can see a meteor tonight,

318
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:20,545
we will do things our own way.

319
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:25,583
If there isn't one,

320
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:31,423
then it is...

321
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,161
the end.

322
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:15,493
The day is about to dawn.

323
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:23,902
I don't want to accept it.

324
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:31,576
The entire night,

325
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,779
I've gone through our story
from beginning to end.

326
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:38,850
From your mom forbidding our relationship

327
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:41,719
to your car accident,

328
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,521
to your amnesia,

329
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,523
to you meeting Yesha.

330
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:49,160
We tried.

331
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,096
We had a race with fate.

332
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:56,734
Now, even God wants us to give up.

333
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:00,672
We shouldn't have regrets.

334
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:08,813
Daoming Si.

335
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,350
Our story is really over.

336
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:25,697
Shancai.

337
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:37,475
I can't accept this.

338
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,613
Because you still owe me an answer.

339
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,017
You have never told me you love me.

340
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:06,971
I once thought...

341
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,176
that I would pick many meteors for you.

342
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:18,950
I'm so stupid.

343
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,688
Now I know that all I can give you...

344
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:43,308
is this meteor ring that changed our fate.

345
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:19,410
Daoming Si!

346
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:24,916
I love you!

347
00:41:43,368 --> 00:41:44,369
I love you.

348
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:37,909
Let's go.

349
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:41,279
Wait for me.

350
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,814
I'm always waiting for you.

351
00:44:57,562 --> 00:44:58,829
<i>Do I love Lei?</i>

352
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:00,131
<i>I don't know.</i>

353
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:01,966
<i>He used to be my dream.</i>

354
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:05,069
<i>But dream is different from love.</i>

355
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,839
<i>Dream is beautiful, but love is real.</i>

356
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:45,176
<i>Hey, don't call me
if there's nothing important.</i>

357
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:47,011
<i>I hate talking on the phone.</i>

358
00:45:48,446 --> 00:45:49,780
<i>No need to write letters, too.</i>

359
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:51,682
<i>If I'm far from your route,</i>

360
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,085
<i>you don't have to go around to visit me.</i>

361
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,420
<i>I'll be busy with my business every day.</i>

362
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,323
<i>And...</i>

363
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:01,726
<i>thank you.</i>

364
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:04,462
<i>Goodbye.</i>

365
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:26,210
