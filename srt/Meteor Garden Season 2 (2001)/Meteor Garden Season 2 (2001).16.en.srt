1
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,307
Granny.

2
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,809
I'm that...

3
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:36,910
Yes.

4
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,812
I want to apologize to you.

5
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,882
I can't take care of your house in Taiwan.

6
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:46,620
Yes, but don't worry,
I'll hand the key to that woman.

7
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,723
Yes. I'm sorry.

8
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:53,260
Don't forget to visit me
when you and Grandpa are in Taiwan.

9
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,861
Okay.

10
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:55,996
Yes, I know.

11
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:58,498
Okay, that's it. Bye-bye.

12
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:22,556
Hello.

13
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:24,057
Meizuo.

14
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:26,226
It's me.

15
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:36,069
I think this contract is good.

16
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,372
The deal is closed.

17
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:40,607
Thank you, President Lin.

18
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:44,878
I believe we'll both greatly benefit
from this cooperation.

19
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:46,413
Ximen.

20
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,349
I'm very impressed by you in this project.

21
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,918
So this is what an elite is capable of.

22
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:55,889
I believe your father is proud of you.

23
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,959
Eagles do not breed doves.

24
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,862
You're the second-generation elite
of the Ximen Corporation.

25
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:06,333
I think President Ximen can retire early.

26
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,301
You're flattering me.

27
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,704
There are so many things
I need to learn from my father.

28
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,107
-Thank you, President Lin.
-Yes.

29
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:24,417
Manager, the car will arrive soon.

30
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,162
What are you doing?

31
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,266
Manager.

32
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,534
I... We did it.

33
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,973
-Xu Shaoyang.
-Yes, sir.

34
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:49,609
Thank you.

35
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,144
Thank you, sir.

36
00:06:58,318 --> 00:06:59,486
Hi, Meizuo.

37
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,423
Ah Si wants to meet us?

38
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:08,595
Okay.

39
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,197
Okay, got it. Bye-bye.

40
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,457
I heard that you've known me
for over 20 years,

41
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,127
and you haven't eaten one egg
cooked by me.

42
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:53,933
I'm sorry.

43
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,503
This is breakfast food, not drunk food.

44
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,438
-But I...
-Who said that?

45
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,106
This is drunk food for F4.

46
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:07,480
Not bad.

47
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:08,982
It goes well with beer.

48
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,483
Really?

49
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,186
Lei, let's see how is the food cooked
by Ah Si.

50
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,342
Did I forget to add salt?

51
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,882
I thought you'd never be able to tell
salt and sugar apart in your life.

52
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,284
What?

53
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:46,619
I added sugar in it?

54
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,155
No.

55
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:51,724
It tastes perfect.

56
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,960
We're the ones
having mixed feelings inside.

57
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,831
I can't believe I just ate food
that was cooked by Ah Si today.

58
00:09:58,531 --> 00:09:59,833
Thank you for this.

59
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,002
It's nothing.

60
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,138
I should be the one saying thank you.

61
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,909
Thank you for walking into my life.

62
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,180
No matter what happened before,

63
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,051
I am myself.

64
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:20,653
That's for sure.

65
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,089
So...

66
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,293
I don't know if you can accept me
for who I am now.

67
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:29,929
Let's be friends again.

68
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,835
No matter what you become,

69
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,938
you'll always be our best buddy.

70
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:40,406
That's right.

71
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,584
I have a little favor to ask.

72
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,888
I miss your catchphrase.

73
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,422
Could you say that again?

74
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:57,891
Catchphrase?

75
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,659
What catchphrase?

76
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,096
-"Did I ask your opinion?"
-"Did I ask your opinion?"

77
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:04,864
What?

78
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:06,900
That?

79
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,436
Whenever you refuse to admit
you're wrong, you would say that.

80
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:12,772
I talked like that?

81
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,507
How is that possible?

82
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:15,742
Pretty childish, right?

83
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,077
It's pretty childish.

84
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:23,550
To be honest, I like who you are now.

85
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:28,254
But I miss that Ah Si who wouldn't admit
he was wrong.

86
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:32,992
Don't be silly. A little rabbit is easier
to deal with than a dinosaur, right?

87
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,530
Did I ask your opinion?

88
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,110
Let's drink.

89
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:47,367
Qinghe.

90
00:12:57,277 --> 00:13:01,281
Remember these rules and you'll easily
survive Yingde University.

91
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,650
Okay, please share them to me.

92
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,520
The first rule is study hard.

93
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:10,089
If you can't figure something out,
you can ask me for help.

94
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,759
If I also don't know it,
I can ask Shancai about it for you.

95
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,828
Shancai is so smart,
so she can solve many of your problems.

96
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:18,464
You're so caring, Qinghe.

97
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,033
You planned out everything for me.

98
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:24,871
Well, the second rule is keep fit.

99
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,939
Although, as a senior,
I stand out for people sometimes,

100
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,942
there are many savage students here.

101
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,245
I have to avoid them at all costs.

102
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,514
This is when running skills come in handy.

103
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:38,184
Shancai is pretty nimble,
so you can exercise and workout with her.

104
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:41,954
Keep fit to avoid the savages.

105
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,090
It makes sense, Qinghe.

106
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,760
Well, the third rule.

107
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,664
The third rule...

108
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:53,633
I can't think of it right now.

109
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,069
I'll go ask Shancai to see
if there's anything more to tell you.

110
00:13:57,036 --> 00:14:01,040
I'm so lucky to have met you.

111
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,242
Don't mention it.

112
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,445
Rest assured, Shancai and I
will take good care of you.

113
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:10,149
Qinghe, you talk about Shancai
all the time.

114
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:13,619
Can it be that you have a crush on her?

115
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:16,689
I don't have a crush on her.

116
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:17,924
If it wasn't for her boyfriend...

117
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:22,995
The handsomest, richest,
and the leader of F4,

118
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,230
Daoming Si.

119
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,737
Sorry, my thoughts trailed off.

120
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,339
Please excuse me.

121
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:37,009
I'm not mad at you. Everyone says
Shancai and I make a good couple.

122
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,346
You are such a great person.

123
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:42,248
You must have a girlfriend, right?

124
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:44,183
There are many people
who have a crush on me.

125
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,618
But I haven't met the right one.

126
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:50,656
So, what type of girl do you like?

127
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:52,892
Maybe...

128
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,895
Maybe I can be your eyes and ears
in the classroom.

129
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,499
What type?

130
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:06,906
I think she must be optimistic,
kind, motivated,

131
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,977
and unlikely to date
other boys easily, right?

132
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,012
I suppose so.

133
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,281
And?

134
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,683
And...

135
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:19,786
Wait a second, Qinghe.

136
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,658
Are you going to write them down?

137
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,793
Yes.

138
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:32,064
Let's record you
in case you talk too fast.

139
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,367
Do you have to take it this seriously?

140
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:35,802
I have to.

141
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,137
So I can repay you for helping me.

142
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:39,605
I have to be very serious about this.

143
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,107
Please start.

144
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,045
She should have a sense of justice.

145
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,047
Sense of justice.

146
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,183
Treat friends better
than she would treat herself.

147
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,518
Treat the poor better
than she would treat the rich.

148
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:53,519
Yeah.

149
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,321
Never flinch back from problems.

150
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,723
The harder the problems are,
the more motivated she becomes.

151
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,294
Really?

152
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,898
I mean, you have a good taste.

153
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:11,370
Xiaoyou, shout with me.

154
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,973
-Come and buy cakes!
-What's wrong with you?

155
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:16,876
<i>For two?</i>

156
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,711
Take your seats, please.

157
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:23,216
And...

158
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:26,552
She must be hardworking and persistent.

159
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:28,454
Like, she works every day
but never complains.

160
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:29,989
Work?

161
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,058
Must she?

162
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:36,295
No.

163
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,898
I mean, working can improve your skills.

164
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:44,103
Okay, I'll start working tomorrow.

165
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:45,238
What?

166
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,408
I mean, I've written everything you said.

167
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:52,845
Well, Qinghe, where will we go next?

168
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,621
Is this the place?

169
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:02,855
Yeah.

170
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:04,624
Qinghe.

171
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,826
Thanks for dropping me home today.

172
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,394
Drive safe.

173
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,863
-I'll see you when the school starts.
-Yeah, see you at school.

174
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,938
Qinghe.

175
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:22,775
I don't know if I should tell you this.

176
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:24,110
That's okay, go ahead.

177
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:28,948
It's 9:57:28 now.

178
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,217
It's almost 10:00.

179
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:36,756
My dad said that if a man
sends a girl home

180
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:40,993
before 10:00 p.m. on their first date,

181
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:45,131
that man is a good man to marry.

182
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:47,300
Good night, Qinghe.

183
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:53,873
Send her back before 10:00 p.m.?

184
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,175
I didn't know that's a thing.

185
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,915
Qinghe, thank you for giving me
such a romantic night.

186
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:10,056
"Romantic"?

187
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,758
"A good man to marry"?

188
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,328
She can't be...

189
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,230
Hey, junior!

190
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:25,271
I'm getting more handsome recently.

191
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,473
Cupid is on my side now.

192
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,878
I need to find more opportunities
to meet Shancai.

193
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,996
Hey, here comes
the authentic Taiwan ice cream.

194
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:53,432
Taro, sweet potato, passion fruit,
dong quai catfish, and braised pork rice.

195
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,968
You will be devouring...

196
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,137
Where is she?

197
00:18:58,804 --> 00:18:59,905
Where did she go?

198
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,110
Hey, what took you so long?

199
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,711
I've completed the discharge procedure.

200
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,912
You... What did you say?

201
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,448
You're leaving? You can leave now?

202
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:10,916
You promised me.

203
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:12,585
I...

204
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,622
It's true that I promised you, but I hope
you can stay here for a little longer.

205
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:20,459
You can leave
after you get your strength back, right?

206
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,662
I've gotten my strength back.

207
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,263
No need to rest.

208
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,100
I'm going to laugh, feel, live.

209
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:31,871
I'm going to go window shopping,
see everything God had put in this world.

210
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:34,940
What did you bring here?

211
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:40,479
Yesha.

212
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,049
You don't want to go with me?

213
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,016
Come on.

214
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:47,620
No.

215
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:50,289
You can go without me.

216
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:53,526
Go without me.

217
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,828
I'm not leaving.

218
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,404
Yesha!

219
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,743
You're walking too slowly.
Haven't done much exercise?

220
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,878
Who haven't done much exercise?
You're talking too much.

221
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:14,380
Why don't you carry all these?

222
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,295
I can't open the windows.

223
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,272
How can people live in this place?

224
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:44,643
You're the one who got this place.

225
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:49,515
Sorry, next time, we'll rent a better one.

226
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,417
I forget I have many relatives, sorry.

227
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,169
What are you looking at?

228
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,239
The words are gone.

229
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:15,374
There were words on that?

230
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,677
From the past. Forget it.

231
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,346
From the past?

232
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:24,517
Well, I got a...

233
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,019
present from the past.

234
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:29,688
What is that?

235
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:33,192
An antique I'm going to bury.

236
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,995
-Show me.
-Oh, no.

237
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,396
Just show me already.

238
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,508
Ah Si's ring.

239
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,978
How did it end up in your hands?

240
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,481
I went to a flea market.

241
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:58,784
I saw this ring the moment I got in there.

242
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:04,323
I remembered Ah Si went nuts
when he saw the ring in the hospital.

243
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:07,726
I asked the seller, and he told me
there are actually two rings.

244
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:12,464
I think Ah Si got so emotional
when he saw this,

245
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,366
so it must mean something special to him.

246
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:18,170
I took it here to give him a surprise.

247
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,206
But now...

248
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:28,214
We can't make this pair of rings whole,
even if I didn't break up with Ah Si.

249
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:30,449
Why is that?

250
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:33,919
On the first day we arrived in Taiwan,

251
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,122
Ah Si's ring got stolen by a thief.

252
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:40,459
Right here.

253
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,331
The same place.

254
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,201
The same ring.

255
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,906
From Barcelona to Taiwan.

256
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:02,014
The same lonely me.

257
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:08,020
No wonder that seller said

258
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:13,993
that if there's only one ring,
the relationship will fall apart.

259
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:24,904
I'd better bury it
or it might also affect us.

260
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,772
That's okay. I'll take it.

261
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,442
Are you sure?

262
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:32,645
Sha.

263
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:43,756
Who else should keep the ring
rather than me now?

264
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:47,826
This is a gift from God.

265
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,097
You'd better not take it away from me.

266
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:54,633
Or else you'll blame me
for not being able to get married.

267
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,436
I thought I was very stupid.

268
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:00,306
But you're even stupider than me.

269
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:03,309
Don't you often say
that dumb people have dumb luck?

270
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:05,077
That's why I met you, right?

271
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,647
What other treasures did you bring here?

272
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,115
Show them to me.

273
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:11,951
Look.

274
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,086
My favorite Mas La Plana!

275
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:16,655
Sha, you're a genius.

276
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:18,123
It's nothing.

277
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,526
Actually, I've planned everything out.

278
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:22,628
If you want to explore Taiwan,

279
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:26,398
you need me, this Taiwan redneck,
to guide you.

280
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:29,401
The first stop is Pingtung.

281
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:31,270
-Why?
-Do you know that?

282
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:35,641
There are Wanluan pig feet in Pingtung.

283
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:38,344
What a weird name for a place.

284
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,946
That's not a name for a place.
I'm talking about real pig feet.

285
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:42,748
You know what? We'll get there,

286
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,817
take a sip of Mas La Plana,

287
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,051
and take a bite of pig feet,

288
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:48,988
and another sip of wine,
and another bite of pig feet...

289
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,422
That feeling, I'm telling you.

290
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,591
Oh, <i>mamma mia</i>!

291
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:53,993
Then what are we waiting for?

292
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,361
Let's go right now.

293
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:56,595
-Let's go.
-One bite of pig feet.

294
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,897
-One sip of Mas La Plana!
-One sip of Mas La Plana!

295
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,666
-<i>Mamma mia!</i>
-<i>Mamma mia!</i>

296
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:31,530
This is not fair.

297
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:43,575
Of course, they'll be forgotten
if you don't open the box.

298
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:47,346
Maybe you won't regret
if you forget about them.

299
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:51,016
But at least you can
try to get to know me again.

300
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:11,103
Hello.

301
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:13,272
I'm Daoming Si.

302
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:15,240
Okay.

303
00:26:18,644 --> 00:26:19,645
Got it.

304
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,448
Okay, that's it.

305
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,162
Shancai.

306
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:40,466
You look pale. What happened?

307
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,202
Who just called you?

308
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,272
It's Daoming Si.

309
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,341
Did you find him?

310
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,310
You must be very happy, right?

311
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,911
Honey.

312
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:56,248
Don't you remember?
Master Ah Si lost his memories.

313
00:26:57,416 --> 00:27:01,220
Relax. He has just forgotten you
temporarily.

314
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,022
You just have to help him
regain his memories.

315
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:05,991
I tried.

316
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:08,127
That's why he just called me.

317
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:09,761
He said he wants to meet me.

318
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,063
What?

319
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,233
Well, isn't that great?

320
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:16,969
It's not great.

321
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,171
It's too great! It can't be better!

322
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:21,073
It's so great
that I thought I misheard him!

323
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,108
-Shancai!
-Mom!

324
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:24,543
I'm so happy!

325
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,545
Shancai, I'm also very happy!

326
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:28,213
I'm going crazy!

327
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,117
Let us go crazy with you.

328
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:43,028
So, you mean Master Ah Si
remembers you, right?

329
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:44,763
No.

330
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:48,233
He said he couldn't remember me
no matter how hard he tried.

331
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:54,306
But after all my effort, this is
the first time he has called me.

332
00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:57,442
This is some progress,
and there's hope for me now, right?

333
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:00,445
He must want to get
to know me again, right?

334
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:09,288
Mom, Dad, please, give me a firm answer.

335
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:14,326
-Yes.
-Yes.

336
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:15,661
Of course.

337
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:19,932
Shancai, Master Ah Si loved you so much.

338
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:21,633
He's sure to remember you again.

339
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,570
Yes. If you can't handle it,
I will go with you.

340
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:27,239
I also have a lot
of good memories with him.

341
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:31,410
I gave him a lucky charm at the airport
on the day he went abroad.

342
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,712
Oh, no, I'm more capable of handling this
than you are.

343
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:37,316
This is a conversation between men,
and that's more like it.

344
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,817
You women know nothing.

345
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:41,353
I'll go. You pig head
will mess up everything.

346
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,222
You're full of nonsense.

347
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:45,324
-I gave him a lucky charm.
-Why did you do that?

348
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,359
You won't light up a worship candle
in the temple for me.

349
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:49,728
-Why did you give him a lucky charm?
-I thought you got no future,

350
00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:50,829
so I invested in him.

351
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:36,775
Ma'am, you want to meet me?

352
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:43,615
I guess you know the time is near,
without me reminding you.

353
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:46,551
Ma'am, don't worry.

354
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,021
The whereabouts of Miss Yesha
is now in my hands.

355
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:54,926
Then you must know
what you're supposed to do next.

356
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,497
Of course, ma'am. Rest assured.

357
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:23,555
Thank you.

358
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:27,459
Red wine. Just put the red wine here.

359
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:30,295
No. I think you'll drink it
when I'm not around.

360
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:32,864
We're far from Pingtung.

361
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:35,267
-How far?
-This far.

362
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,437
You insist on taking the train.

363
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,940
The distance is so much farther.

364
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:49,748
Sha, could we buy a cake first
before we leave Taipei?

365
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:50,716
What?

366
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,051
I want to see how's Shancai now.

367
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:59,257
I'll have no regret
if I can see her happy smile.

368
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:06,531
Okay, let's go.

369
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,786
-Sha.
-Yeah?

370
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:29,187
Remember, you can't--

371
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:31,890
Let Shancai know you're still in Taiwan.

372
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:35,494
You've told me that 1,800 times.

373
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:38,964
Thank you for coming.

374
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,901
Please move a little bit ahead.

375
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:47,873
Welcome.

376
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:48,940
I'll have a cake.

377
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:52,677
What flavor would you like?

378
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:01,920
What cake is that one?

379
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,022
That's mango cheesecake.

380
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,024
I'm sorry, that's already been reserved.

381
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,961
But I really want that cake.

382
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:12,264
And I want exactly that one.

383
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,166
I'm very sorry, sir.

384
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:15,734
Please come earlier tomorrow.

385
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:19,638
So you want me to give it up?

386
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:24,743
But if you were me and you love this cake,

387
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:28,346
and someone else also wants it,

388
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:29,648
what would you do?

389
00:32:30,015 --> 00:32:31,316
Would you give it up?

390
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,019
I guess so,

391
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:37,322
if they really love the cake
and badly want it.

392
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:39,691
How would you...

393
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:44,996
How would you know if they really love
this cake and want it so badly?

394
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:50,635
I would know if I see the looks
on their faces.

395
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,738
Sir, our chocolate cakes
are pretty good, too.

396
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:55,407
How did you know I want to buy...

397
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:59,110
Because you've been staring at it
all this while.

398
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:02,781
Do you want me to wrap it up for you?

399
00:33:07,886 --> 00:33:10,222
I'm so sorry for your boyfriend.

400
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:12,657
What do you mean?

401
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:14,493
Because...

402
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:19,431
if there's another girl who loves him,
and she also loves him so much,

403
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:25,837
then you'll give him up to her
like you give away cakes.

404
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:29,741
People are not cakes.
I won't easily give him up.

405
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,911
I'm sorry.

406
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,648
Sorry, I talked too much.

407
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:42,454
Do I look like a pervert wandering around,
harassing young girls?

408
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:44,189
No.

409
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:48,660
You're more like an annoying bad customer
which is worse than a pervert.

410
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,631
Don't you think
you're talking too bluntly?

411
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:56,801
I think one shouldn't be too stubborn.

412
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,037
This is what I learned from my new friend.

413
00:33:59,938 --> 00:34:03,742
When you share your sorrow,
it will be divided.

414
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:07,946
But when you share your happiness,
it will be doubled.

415
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,618
I'm sorry.

416
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:18,890
I take back my words.

417
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:20,492
What words?

418
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:25,597
I don't feel sorry for your boyfriend now.

419
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:29,834
I think he must be relaxed
and comfortable with you.

420
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:35,640
You two will be happy together.

421
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:40,111
Happiness is what we fight for
by ourselves.

422
00:34:40,312 --> 00:34:41,513
I'm trying my best.

423
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,616
I have no regret
as long as he can feel my sincerity.

424
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:45,750
Can he?

425
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:49,187
Yes.

426
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:50,922
Really.

427
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,694
She smiled.

428
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,163
Did you see how happy she is
when she smiled?

429
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:01,866
I think she had that smile on her face
because she thought of Ah Si.

430
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,538
So, things are going well
between her and Ah Si, right?

431
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:07,772
-Right?
-Yeah.

432
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:14,412
Then I'm relieved.

433
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,847
Miss Yesha.

434
00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:18,583
How did you know my name?

435
00:35:20,018 --> 00:35:22,754
We wouldn't be here for you,
if we didn't know your name.

436
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:27,626
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

437
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,694
I wish you a happy life, sir.

438
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:34,132
You bought our famous Happiness Cake.

439
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:39,304
That means you can taste happiness
when you share it with the one you love.

440
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:41,640
Thank you.

441
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:45,944
I wish you an energetic and happy life.

442
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:47,579
Thank you.

443
00:35:58,123 --> 00:35:59,858
Yesha.

444
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:01,993
Yesha!

445
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,217
Don't move.

446
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:01,553
-Let me go.
-Don't move.

447
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,855
Who let you treat my guest like this?

448
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:05,657
Leave!

449
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:06,658
-Yes.
-Yes.

450
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:12,764
You're Ah Si's mom.

451
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:15,900
I'm sorry, Miss Yesha.

452
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:19,070
They seemed to be untrained.
Sorry for the chaos.

453
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:20,572
Please, take a seat.

454
00:37:23,475 --> 00:37:25,043
Why did you take me here?

455
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:28,580
This is not what you think.

456
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,882
I'm not the one who wants to find you.

457
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:32,083
It's my son.

458
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:34,219
Ah Si?

459
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,157
I actually have you to thank you.

460
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:43,361
If it wasn't for you,
Ah Si wouldn't agree to come home.

461
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:46,030
You know what?

462
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:48,166
He came here to negotiate with me.

463
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,802
He wanted me to find you
with everything I have.

464
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,373
I'm sorry, Mrs. Daoming.

465
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,777
What you talked about with Ah Si
is none of my business.

466
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,112
I won't stay here.

467
00:38:02,147 --> 00:38:04,015
And my friend must be looking for me.

468
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:04,949
I'm sorry.

469
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:08,553
Miss Yesha.

470
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:13,858
I guess you didn't get what I meant.

471
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:16,928
Ah Si is my only son.

472
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:19,297
He has suffered a lot out there.

473
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:23,835
As his mother, I can't let him down.

474
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:26,404
What are you up to now?

475
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:35,180
Since Ah Si loves you so much,
I hope you can be engaged to him soon.

476
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:38,316
Don't you find yourself ridiculous?

477
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:41,953
As a...

478
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:46,324
You're one of the royals
in the Kingdom of Bhutan,

479
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:49,594
and yet you hid your identity,
went across the ocean

480
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:54,199
to live a beggar's life with a stranger.

481
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:59,971
I think you're better at being ridiculous
than me.

482
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:02,807
I don't know what you're talking about.

483
00:39:06,144 --> 00:39:09,080
You can stop acting, Miss Yesha.

484
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:13,218
Or should I call you, Princess Yesha.

485
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:34,806
Daoming Si.

486
00:39:35,273 --> 00:39:36,441
You really came here.

487
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:39,744
I asked you out, right?

488
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:48,953
Why did it have to be here?

489
00:39:49,254 --> 00:39:50,521
Go inside and you'll know.

490
00:39:58,863 --> 00:39:59,697
Take a seat.

491
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:04,068
I rarely had the chance
to treat you to an ice cream.

492
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:07,038
You still insist on paying the bill
just like before.

493
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:10,375
A poor man has dignity, too, okay?

494
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:14,979
Yes, you finally get what I feel!

495
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:18,216
We kept arguing about money in the past.

496
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:20,685
You thought money isn't a problem,
and I was nitpicking.

497
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,420
I would get so mad that whenever...

498
00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:32,463
Don't be so nervous
when you're talking to me, okay?

499
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:39,871
I know I used to have a bad temper.

500
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,908
Not really.

501
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:48,513
You just didn't like to try new things.

502
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,916
Like what you said to be ordinary dates,
which include going out to amusement parks

503
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:54,452
with my friend and her boyfriend.

504
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:57,488
And about the lucky charm
my mom gave you...

505
00:40:58,923 --> 00:40:59,824
Lucky charm?

506
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,394
She got it from the Lungshan Temple.

507
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:12,537
Hey, your ice cream is melting.

508
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:19,777
Why is it so sweet?

509
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:21,746
You would say that in the past, too.

510
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,982
You would say it's so sweet
after your first bite.

511
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,086
Don't get me wrong.

512
00:41:28,386 --> 00:41:29,787
I just want to say...

513
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,991
that now I know that people's taste
won't change.

514
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:37,195
Some things may not always stay the same,

515
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:42,000
but there are feelings that stay the same
no matter what happens.

516
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:46,404
Shancai.

517
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,209
I couldn't feel how you felt before.

518
00:41:53,478 --> 00:41:54,879
Me, too.

519
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:00,118
Now I understand.

520
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,789
I want to apologize to you.

521
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:07,925
I'm sorry.

522
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:25,043
Thank you for the happiness you gave me.

523
00:42:28,813 --> 00:42:31,416
But I can only return
the memories to you now.

524
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,221
It's because I don't have them anymore.

525
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:41,025
Please give me up.

526
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:42,360
Why should I?

527
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:46,197
I would've given up earlier
if I wanted to.

528
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:50,134
This was also what you said before.

529
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:52,837
You said we were meant to be.

530
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:55,373
You didn't allow me to give up,

531
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,941
and I won't give up now.

532
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:03,781
You know what?

533
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:07,552
That lucky charm you were talking about...

534
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:10,655
I gave it to Yesha a long time ago.

535
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:15,860
Some things don't change.

536
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:19,730
But once they have,

537
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,034
they can't be reversed anymore.

538
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,669
Daoming Si.

539
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:26,304
Yesha has already left.

540
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:27,371
I'll find her.

541
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:31,642
No matter where she is, I'll find her.

542
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,867
It took you so much work
to investigate me,

543
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:57,735
so I think you're not doing this
only for Ah Si.

544
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:03,841
Right.

545
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:06,744
I don't want to waste our time.

546
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:14,652
Daoming Family owns more fortune
than some of the small countries.

547
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:19,357
The only way to enhance Daoming Family

548
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:22,293
is to seek titles.

549
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:23,794
Titles?

550
00:44:25,196 --> 00:44:29,834
Such as being related to
the Kingdom of Bhutan royal family.

551
00:44:30,568 --> 00:44:37,375
This will enhance my business status
and reputation.

552
00:44:38,743 --> 00:44:40,912
So this is your real purpose.

553
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,348
Of course, I also care about Ah Si.

554
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:47,518
This is what people call
"Kill two birds with one stone."

555
00:44:48,286 --> 00:44:52,857
If you want to know
which is more important to me,

556
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:56,294
I think it's totally meaningless.

557
00:44:56,594 --> 00:44:59,263
You're right. So, no matter
which one is more important,

558
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:00,631
my answer is no.

559
00:45:01,132 --> 00:45:02,366
Miss Yesha.

560
00:45:03,668 --> 00:45:05,469
Friendship is what you value most, right?

561
00:45:06,304 --> 00:45:07,538
What do you mean?

562
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:11,876
You would tell Shancai everything
even though you just met her.

563
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:15,379
You were happy with Ah Si before,

564
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:17,548
and now you insist on leaving.

565
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:20,785
I think it's for Shancai, right?

566
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:23,020
Don't you dare touch Shancai.

567
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:26,090
This is the only chance
I'm giving Shancai.

568
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:28,392
You should know that.

569
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:30,995
With her background,

570
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:34,999
she can never be a part
of the Daoming family.

571
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,903
But if you agree to be engaged to Ah Si,

572
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:42,506
of course, which will only be in name,

573
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:46,611
I will allow Shancai to meet with Ah Si.

574
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:50,615
In that way, I can get what I want,

575
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,352
and Shancai might get what she wants.

576
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:58,522
Of course,
the royal family of your country, too.

577
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:27,778
