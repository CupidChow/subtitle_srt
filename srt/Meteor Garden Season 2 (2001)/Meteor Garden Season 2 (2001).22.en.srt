1
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,759
There's nothing I haven't learned well
since my childhood.

2
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:10,364
Especially your so-called best parts.

3
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,739
Can you learn something like this well?

4
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:52,873
-Stop it.
-Hey.

5
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:53,974
Let's go.

6
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:55,876
What's wrong with him?

7
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,151
What were you doing back there?

8
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,219
I was...

9
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:13,760
I just wanted to prove

10
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,096
that I'll never lose to any other woman.

11
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,500
Whatever the girls you love can do,

12
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:23,070
I can do better.

13
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,127
Pick me up at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow.

14
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,449
Mom cooked red oil wontons.

15
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,560
Dad, what are you thinking about?

16
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,730
Your mom has cooked so many dishes.

17
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,132
I'm so hungry now.

18
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,373
I didn't have time to buy vegetables,

19
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,742
so I prepared the dinner
with what's left in the fridge.

20
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,378
But these are all your favorites.

21
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,380
It's a feast, mom.

22
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,315
Join us at the table,
dad and I are waiting for you.

23
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:43,316
Here, take your seat.

24
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,331
Wow, what an amazing soup!

25
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,101
Let's eat. The food is getting cold.

26
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,937
Great.

27
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:05,572
Our son had been in hospital
for some time.

28
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,008
We had all been through a lot together
as a family.

29
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,510
I'm glad everything is fine now.

30
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,151
Dad,

31
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:19,986
I think this turns out to be a good thing.

32
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,189
We haven't had dinner together
for a long time.

33
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:23,757
Right, mom?

34
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,235
Dad, Mom, to my full recovery.

35
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,170
Cheers.

36
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:44,845
Let's eat.

37
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,594
Mom, I'm stuffed.

38
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,063
After you're done,
you should take your medicine now.

39
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,333
-Want some coffee?
-Of course.

40
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,400
Then I'll brew some for you.

41
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:22,549
Dad.

42
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,185
Want some coffee?

43
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:26,353
Yeah.

44
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:35,095
DIVORCE SETTLEMENT

45
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:54,447
I really enjoyed dinner tonight.

46
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,384
Thank you.

47
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:07,794
Ever since we met each other,

48
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,965
no one knows your feelings for me
better than you.

49
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,970
You can cut to the chase.

50
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,742
You know,

51
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:25,979
I haven't been a good husband.

52
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,016
But after all these years,

53
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,820
no matter how upset you got,

54
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:37,624
you're still doing a great job
as a mother.

55
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,528
So I should...

56
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:44,497
say, "I'm sorry."

57
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:46,900
I'm Ximen's mother.

58
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,936
I'm just doing what a mother should do.

59
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:51,571
I know.

60
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,342
After all these years,

61
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,178
I know it all.

62
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,148
So...

63
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,252
You agreed to let me take our son,

64
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,822
I couldn't thank you enough.

65
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,191
So I think it's time

66
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:16,463
to give you the divorce settlement
you've always wanted.

67
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:12,419
Dad.

68
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,921
Why didn't you go to bed?

69
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,122
I couldn't sleep.

70
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,232
Your medicine.

71
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,268
You forgot to take it.

72
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:40,447
What?

73
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,915
Your medicine.

74
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,650
You haven't taken yours too, right?

75
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,623
These medicines are
just temporary solution.

76
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,561
I know.

77
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:58,398
But at least it can keep
your blood pressure within normal limits.

78
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,468
No matter how mad...

79
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,271
or how upset you are,

80
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:08,074
you can still have a life to live.

81
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,271
Hey.

82
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,306
Don't forget you just left hospital.

83
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,318
Like father, like son.

84
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:02,729
It seems
that we've never drank together before.

85
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,565
That's okay.

86
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:07,467
We can always do this later.

87
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,035
Right?

88
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:19,579
I mean, dad,

89
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,049
you really should drink less.

90
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,555
What?

91
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:30,523
Trying to educate me now?

92
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:32,625
Just you wait.

93
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,427
I'll nag more than mom.

94
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,714
What a pretty van!

95
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:58,585
It's awesome, but isn't it too showy?

96
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,787
Wow, it's so beautiful!

97
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:03,957
How is it?

98
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:05,358
Look.

99
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:09,829
Awesome.

100
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:15,568
-It's awesome.
-Wow, amazing.

101
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,873
It's so cute!

102
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,377
Wow, what great colors.

103
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,380
It's so cool!

104
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,051
There are even clouds on it.

105
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:34,254
This color is so cute.

106
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,888
There's a sun at the back!

107
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:37,757
Everything about it is so cool.

108
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,693
This is your breakfast van.

109
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,996
-Breakfast van?
-Breakfast van?

110
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:43,896
Yeah.

111
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,398
This is designed by Yesha.

112
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:48,334
You don't have to worry about your jobs
even if you have no breakfast restaurant.

113
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,837
Our breakfast van!

114
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:39,519
What's wrong with you?

115
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,154
Qinghe!

116
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,790
My shoes aren't made very well

117
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,725
so I'm getting cramps.

118
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:46,859
-So--
-Easy.

119
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:47,994
To put it simply,

120
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,329
you just sprain your ankle?

121
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,364
Come on.

122
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,067
Thank you, Qinghe.

123
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,440
Are you okay?

124
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,374
Yeah.

125
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,212
Does it hurt?

126
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,181
Yes.

127
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,097
Qinghe.

128
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:25,865
Daoming Si.

129
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:27,200
Where are you going?

130
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:28,835
I...

131
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:29,736
I'm crossing the road.

132
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,372
After all the time, why is it still
so hard for you to get to your point?

133
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:35,041
-I...
-Green light. We're leaving now.

134
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,044
Hey, what's your phone number?

135
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,445
My phone number is

136
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,481
09399999.

137
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:42,949
I'll wait for your call.

138
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:45,251
Oh, okay. I'll call you later.

139
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:46,452
Okay, talk to you later.

140
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:57,764
Qinghe, is that man Shancai's sweetheart?

141
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,900
The legend of Yingde University
and the leader of F4, Daoming Si?

142
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,535
Yes.

143
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:03,770
We are close friends.

144
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,539
We always hung out together
back in our school days.

145
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,675
Then why does everyone say
he lost his memory?

146
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,778
Didn't he recognize you at first sight?

147
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,080
Of course he remembers me.

148
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:15,982
Wait.

149
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,283
How could he remember me?

150
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:21,053
Daoming Si!

151
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,225
This is big news!

152
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,727
I have to tell Shancai right now.

153
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:29,529
Oh, hey, Qinghe...

154
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:32,498
Qinghe, wait for me!

155
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:33,466
Qinghe!

156
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,134
Who's that Qinghe?

157
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:36,602
My fellow student in Yingde.

158
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:37,904
-Your fellow student?
-Yeah.

159
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,138
How could you remember him?

160
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,109
Yeah.

161
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,311
How could I remember him?

162
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:48,548
Get out of my way!

163
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,783
There's something very important
I have to tell Shancai.

164
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:51,684
I'm sorry.

165
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:54,120
This it's policy that you need
to register first to get your card.

166
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,521
Where should I register? What card?

167
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:56,456
That way, please.

168
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,392
I would like to meet Shancai.

169
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,228
Sir, there are hundreds of employees
in our company.

170
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,297
You have to tell me what department
is she in.

171
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,034
She's in... She...

172
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,837
She's in the General Affairs Department.
Yeah, the General Affairs Department.

173
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,004
Do I need to register?

174
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,207
One moment please,
let me check it for you.

175
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,876
Let's see if there's someone called
that... Cai.

176
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:19,512
How to spell it?

177
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,014
The name.

178
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,517
I'm Chen Qinghe.

179
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:25,751
I'm not asking for your name.

180
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:29,889
Shancai.

181
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:31,290
Dong Shancai.

182
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,593
S, H, A, N,

183
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,994
and...

184
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:37,997
C, A, I.

185
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:41,467
Hurry up.

186
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,203
Please fill in this form.

187
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,338
Qinghe!

188
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:52,979
I'm in such a hurry, and they ask me
to fill in this... crap!

189
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,815
Why don't you call Shancai?

190
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,217
Oh, right.

191
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,959
Hello, Shancai.

192
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,294
I'm at your company's lobby area.

193
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,897
I have the most important thing
in the world to tell you.

194
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:12,365
Come down here right now.

195
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,333
You know what,

196
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,769
Daoming Si regained his memory.

197
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:17,803
Hurry up!

198
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:21,741
Madam.

199
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:24,076
I see.

200
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:25,511
You can leave now.

201
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:26,612
I'll think about it.

202
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,347
Madam.

203
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,022
Hurry up.

204
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:37,890
Come on.

205
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,759
Qinghe.

206
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,661
-Shancai.
-Shancai.

207
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,696
Did you say
that Daoming Si regained his memory?

208
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,498
-Yes.
-What happened? Tell me already.

209
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,033
Okay.

210
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,801
He greeted me.

211
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:51,537
And he recognized me at first sight.

212
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:53,205
And he was the one who greeted first.

213
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,373
He called me "Qinghe."

214
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,509
Qinghe, put your words together.

215
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:57,743
You said he recognized you.

216
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,011
Where did you meet?

217
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,112
What else did you talk about?

218
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,047
I...

219
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,215
Shancai, here's the story.

220
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,984
When Qinghe and I were
on our way to school,

221
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,752
we met Daoming Si on the road.

222
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,055
He called Qinghe when he saw us.

223
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:10,623
They greeted each other.

224
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,891
Everything was so smooth,

225
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,726
and it doesn't look like
he lost his memory.

226
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,795
Yeah, that's it.

227
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:17,730
He recognized you?

228
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:19,799
He got his memory back.

229
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,301
Does he remember everything?

230
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,171
Daoming Si regained his memory.

231
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:27,740
Daoming Si regained his memory.

232
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,342
So...

233
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,477
What will I do?

234
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:32,545
What should I do?

235
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:33,446
Yeah.

236
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,681
What should you do...

237
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:39,652
First, tell him to call off
his engagement?

238
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:41,721
Call off the engagement?

239
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,688
-Yes.
-Yeah.

240
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,023
He regained his memory,

241
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,825
so he'll love you as before,

242
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,793
and he won't love that Princess
of Bhu-crap anymore.

243
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,196
Then, he'll come back to you.

244
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:52,098
He'll ask that Princess of Bhu-crap
to go away.

245
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:53,466
Let's find Daoming Si right now.

246
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,835
Qinghe, wait for me.

247
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:57,336
Qinghe.

248
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,575
Thank you for driving Yesha home.

249
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,776
No problem.

250
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:04,710
Thank you.

251
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:06,078
Okay, we're leaving.

252
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,307
It's not time to work now, hurry up!

253
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:36,642
Qinghe, wait for me!

254
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:37,677
Qinghe.

255
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,945
Qinghe, Daoming Si!

256
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:43,115
Daoming Si!

257
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,352
You do know I'm Chen Qinghe, right?

258
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:48,754
What are you doing,
son of the nouveau riche?

259
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:51,023
He even knows
that I'm the son of the nouveau riche.

260
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,725
There must be so much you want
to tell Shancai.

261
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:53,959
-Hurry up.
-Qinghe.

262
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,362
Did I ask for your opinion, Chen Qinghe?

263
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,365
It's true that I have so much
to tell Shancai.

264
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:00,866
-But--
-Then say it.

265
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,970
You are so annoying!

266
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,607
Never mind.

267
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:11,844
Shancai.

268
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:13,679
Thank you.

269
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,048
That breakfast van?

270
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:19,051
Yesha is so happy about it.

271
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,954
I haven't seen her so happy
for a long time.

272
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:23,155
So...

273
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,458
Thank you.

274
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:28,461
That's it?

275
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:30,496
You should...

276
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,698
have much more to tell Shancai.

277
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,900
What else should I say?

278
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:38,037
Say thank you to your dad for me.

279
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:42,374
That's not what I meant.

280
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,610
-Daoming Si, you should say, "I love--"
-Qinghe!

281
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:46,345
Daoming Si,

282
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:48,114
just ignore him.

283
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:49,949
We're done here.

284
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:52,251
No, you have to talk things out right now.

285
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:54,019
Fine, let's talk things out.

286
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,288
Chen Qinghe, what are you so upset about?

287
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:57,957
I am very upset with you.

288
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,359
-Since you regained your memory--
-Stop!

289
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,199
I'm leaving now.

290
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,438
Qinghe, don't make Shancai angry anymore.

291
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:13,405
Do you hear me?

292
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:15,441
You...

293
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,010
-Daoming Si!
-Qinghe!

294
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,881
Shancai, he regained his memory but...

295
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,149
He didn't.

296
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:26,318
You are lying.

297
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,954
He knows
that I'm the son of the nouveau riche.

298
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:31,690
If he really regained his memory,

299
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,425
he would have already pushed you aside

300
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,461
before you could continue babbling, right?

301
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:38,364
You're right.

302
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:46,138
Shancai, don't you want to go back
to how things were with Daoming Si?

303
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:49,475
If I can't,

304
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:50,976
at least for now,

305
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:53,279
I can stick around Daoming Si,

306
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:55,681
and make new memories, right?

307
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:58,751
Shancai.

308
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,925
<i>I would be lying
if I said I had no regrets.</i>

309
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,296
<i>If even Qinghe has a place
in Daoming Si's memory,</i>

310
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:15,568
<i>why am I excluded from it?</i>

311
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,181
Actually, I have something more
to tell you.

312
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:31,383
Daoming Si.

313
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,220
There are some emotions...

314
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,389
I can't share with anyone.

315
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:40,626
Can I share them with you?

316
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:43,262
Aren't we friends?

317
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:48,734
I don't get it.

318
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:51,737
Why can I remember Qinghe,

319
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:54,607
and only Qinghe?

320
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,244
I was shocked too.

321
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:03,949
Qinghe...

322
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:08,587
I feel amused whenever I think of him.

323
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,324
Were we good friends in the past?

324
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:15,728
I wouldn't say that.

325
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,564
Qinghe is my fellow student
in middle school.

326
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,200
Since he was transferred to Yingde,

327
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:22,935
he has always admired F4.

328
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,405
He's always wanted to fit in with you,

329
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:29,108
but you guys kept teasing him
in all kinds of ways.

330
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,044
Teasing him in all kinds of ways?

331
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:33,445
Then what happened?

332
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,749
Then he still wanted to join you,

333
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,618
and you would continue to tease him.

334
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:42,755
Then he would try harder to join you.

335
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,728
This feeling is really strange.

336
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:54,366
When I think of Qinghe,

337
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:57,002
I didn't have a headache.

338
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:02,007
Maybe it's because he's so funny,

339
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:04,576
so my memory chose him.

340
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,615
There is still something
I don't understand.

341
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:13,285
Do you remember everything?

342
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:15,287
I mean,

343
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:18,357
for those who will never lose
their memory like you,

344
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,726
if you remember everything,

345
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,494
won't you feel exhausted?

346
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,131
We often forget things too.

347
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,600
Like memorizing material,

348
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,302
we'll forget what we've memorized
in no time.

349
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,406
We also forget
unimportant people and stuff.

350
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:38,577
Isn't there a term
called "brain capacity"?

351
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:44,450
It roughly means new memories
will push out the old ones.

352
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:48,921
But there are things that you can't forget
no matter how hard you try.

353
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:53,859
What are the things
that you'll remember forever?

354
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:03,068
Let's have lunch together, okay?

355
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:04,703
Have lunch?

356
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:05,971
Okay.

357
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:07,072
What would you like to eat?

358
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:08,140
Young master.

359
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:11,844
Madam wants to meet you.

360
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:17,883
Just think about it.

361
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,651
I'll call you later.

362
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,286
I'll be waiting for your call.

363
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:50,783
Qinghe,

364
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,051
are you praying?

365
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,819
When did you become religious?

366
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:02,227
How is it possible that Daoming Si
hasn't regained his memory?

367
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:04,930
Apparently, he remembers me.

368
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:08,400
I have a conclusion of this.

369
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:11,170
What conclusion?

370
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:16,775
Apparently, you're the connection
to Daoming Si's past memories.

371
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:22,147
Which means, Qinghe is the key
to unlock Daoming Si's memory.

372
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,052
You said...

373
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,520
I'm what?

374
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:32,291
You're the key.

375
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,859
The key to his memories.

376
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:38,997
I believe you're the only one
who can restore Daoming Si's memory.

377
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:43,235
Yeah.

378
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:51,577
So you're the only one
who can get Shancai's happiness back.

379
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:53,879
I see.

380
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,050
God sent me to stay beside her,

381
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:02,688
so I can store Daoming Si's memory.

382
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,358
My dad once said,

383
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:08,060
"A man who knows his goal,

384
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,662
and fights for it with passion,

385
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:13,232
is a good man
with aspiration and courage."

386
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:14,933
You're right.

387
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:16,702
Mimi,

388
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,004
I'll do anything for Shancai.

389
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,178
I'm so jealous of Shancai.

390
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:29,648
She got so many people
fighting for her happiness.

391
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:34,720
Mimi, let's fight together
for Shancai's happiness.

392
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:53,071
Xiao Guai, I gave you a little more
than usual today,

393
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:55,941
because I'll have lunch with Daoming Si.

394
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:13,759
Ah Si,

395
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:18,030
I scheduled an appointment
with a neurologist for you.

396
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:21,833
I will take you to do
a thorough examination in a few days.

397
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,204
Don't bother with me.

398
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,739
If needed, Yesha will come with me.

399
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,981
You and Yesha...

400
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:38,951
How are things between you two?

401
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,124
Are you trying to say...

402
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:48,627
things shouldn't go well
between Yesha and I?

403
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:56,101
Maybe I'm thinking too much.

404
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,338
I'm just thinking...

405
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,174
that Shancai and you are very close.

406
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:05,010
Given your history with her,

407
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:08,880
I don't know if Yesha suspects something?

408
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,417
Mom.

409
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:15,254
Shancai is Yesha's good friend.

410
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:17,889
She can't have such stupid thoughts
like you do.

411
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,329
Maybe Yesha doesn't have
such stupid thoughts,

412
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:26,865
but what about Shancai?

413
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:33,772
What do you mean?

414
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:37,776
Ah Si, hasn't it ever occurred to you?

415
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:45,317
Why does your ex-girlfriend
deliberately stick around you?

416
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:48,620
Aren't you the one who landed her a job
at the company?

417
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,691
That's because I pity her.

418
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,862
But later I found she has a secret scheme.

419
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:01,433
She has been trying to meddle
in your relationship with Yesha.

420
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:10,142
Don't you think Yesha's emotions are
greatly affected by Shancai?

421
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:11,610
She's not what you think!

422
00:30:11,677 --> 00:30:13,111
Shancai is not what I think?

423
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,315
How much do you remember about her?

424
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:20,752
I've witnessed how
she deliberately tortured you

425
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,220
with your feelings,

426
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:23,622
and had you in the palm of her hands.

427
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:26,058
If it were not for
her selfish possessive desire,

428
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:29,528
how could you get into that accident
in Barcelona?

429
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:33,765
I even suspect...

430
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:35,801
that your amnesia...

431
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,437
is caused by your subconscious

432
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,872
rejecting your unhappy memories
in the past.

433
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:42,641
However,

434
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:45,110
she's a pretty clever girl.

435
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:48,780
She knows how to seize the opportunity.

436
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:55,654
She made Yesha bear her innocence
and the responsibility of the accident.

437
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:59,925
So Yesha would be buried
under shame and guilt.

438
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:03,895
Her scheme is to force Yesha
to give you back to her.

439
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:05,797
What's more...

440
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,032
Enough!

441
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,535
It's true that I lost my memory,
but I still have my eyes.

442
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,873
The Shancai I see is nowhere near
that kind of person.

443
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,974
Ah Si.

444
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:19,244
You can be mad at me,

445
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,780
but I hope you believe,

446
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:25,517
in this world,

447
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:28,754
the only one who will never hurt you...

448
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,289
is me.

449
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:35,527
I'm done.

450
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:36,695
Enjoy your meal.

451
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:31,149
Hello.

452
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:32,784
Yesha.

453
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:34,920
Tonight?

454
00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:36,655
Okay.

455
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:39,791
See you tonight.

456
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,426
It's time to get up!

457
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:50,996
I haven't gotten 15 hours sleep yet.

458
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,063
Stop disturbing me.

459
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:54,499
Sometimes, I'm so jealous of you.

460
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,469
No matter what happens,
you can still fall asleep.

461
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,604
It's good that you know this.

462
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:02,707
So stop disturbing me
with your own things.

463
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,210
I have no nothing to do.
That's why I'm so bored.

464
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:07,512
I hope I can just fall asleep like you do.

465
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,888
<i>I can't let go of your chase</i>

466
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,457
<i>I'm willing to let you do it</i>

467
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:23,061
<i>I tell God</i>

468
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:25,964
<i>I'm not drunk yet</i>

469
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:29,234
You're so bored, aren't you?

470
00:34:30,936 --> 00:34:33,138
Ximen worked so hard
that he got gastrorrhagia.

471
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:35,840
You got work to do too.

472
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,076
And now you're singing at my place?

473
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,979
They'll do just fine without me.

474
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,648
All I do is stamping and signing.

475
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:45,784
I would stamp all day
before getting off work.

476
00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:49,454
I won't miss anything if I skip work.

477
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,756
I'm not interested being someone
like Ximen,

478
00:34:52,624 --> 00:34:54,125
who works so hard that he throws up blood.

479
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,795
Are you really gonna continue sleeping?

480
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:00,532
Fine, then I won't disturb you.

481
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,534
I just want to...

482
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:05,370
<i>Make a wish</i>

483
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,672
<i>Make a wish</i>

484
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:10,108
<i>Don't close your eyes and sleep anymore</i>

485
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,310
<i>Get up</i>

486
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:14,112
<i>Sing with me</i>

487
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:25,824
Lei, Ximen left hospital now.

488
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,525
I think the F4 should hang out together.

489
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,895
What do you think?

490
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,666
What do you think, Lei?

491
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,868
Hey!

492
00:35:43,008 --> 00:35:44,643
If you want to ask anyone out,

493
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,544
please use that phone downstairs.

494
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:48,380
And...

495
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:50,649
if you want to sing some more,

496
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:52,717
can't you go to karaoke?

497
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:55,887
I sang live for you,
and you're saying this to me?

498
00:35:58,957 --> 00:36:00,125
You got no taste in music.

499
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,501
It has been so long
since we last hung out.

500
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,970
Ah Si, you've been absent for too long.

501
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,241
Your stomach has just recovered.
Are you sure you can drink?

502
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,576
I drank with my dad
the day I left hospital.

503
00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:20,278
Drank with your dad?

504
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:26,217
I'm really happy these days.

505
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,055
It might sound exaggerated,

506
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:32,991
but I feel like I'm an orphan who found
his father.

507
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,661
Okay.

508
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:39,230
To your happiness, let's make a toast.

509
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:47,972
Ximen,

510
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,341
I'm so happy that you're happy.

511
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:55,113
But what do you mean
by "an orphan who found his father"?

512
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,348
Let's say we don't have
the best father and son relationship.

513
00:36:58,149 --> 00:36:59,617
But this time when I was sick,

514
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,654
we opened our hearts to each other.

515
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:05,857
Ah Si,

516
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:08,693
We 100% accept you as who you are now,

517
00:37:09,494 --> 00:37:12,263
but we hope you can regain your memory
very soon

518
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,998
so you can understand
what we're talking about.

519
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:18,036
A very strange thing happened to me today.

520
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:20,171
I saw Qinghe today.

521
00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:21,873
What's so strange about that?

522
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:25,343
What's strange is that
I recognized him at first sight.

523
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,445
I even said his name out loud.

524
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:31,649
That's weird.

525
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,053
Do you remember how we teased
the son of that nouveau riche?

526
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,857
Shancai told me something about it,

527
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:41,760
but I don't remember any of them.

528
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:44,429
That's okay if you can't remember.

529
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,197
I think it's good news.

530
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:49,434
Yeah. It means you are about to
regain your memory soon.

531
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:51,903
Let's have another toast.

532
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,679
-What about you?
-What about me?

533
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:02,981
What's your good news?

534
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,885
Why should I have good news?

535
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,554
Didn't you go on a blind date?

536
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:15,360
I get pissed off whenever I think of it.

537
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:17,295
Pissed off?

538
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,532
Is it because she is too dumb,

539
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:22,233
too ugly, or too cute?

540
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:24,803
She's not dumb,

541
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:26,104
she's not ugly, either.

542
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:27,305
And she's not cute.

543
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:29,974
I just don't like her.

544
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:31,910
Then just reject her.

545
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:32,944
Why are you pissed off?

546
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:37,015
Of course I'm pissed off.
She's merely a pretty face,

547
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:38,783
and she loves going against me.

548
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:42,220
If we don't like each other,
things will be easier.

549
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:46,958
But she kept telling my mom and her mom
that we had a great date.

550
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,727
So I have to go on those boring dates
with her again and again.

551
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:54,465
"Go on those boring dates."

552
00:38:57,769 --> 00:38:59,838
It doesn't sound like
something Meizuo would say.

553
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,610
Why don't you just straight up tell her
that you don't like her?

554
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,078
I told her.

555
00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:09,480
I've used all my moves
but they were useless.

556
00:39:10,215 --> 00:39:12,417
Maybe you don't want
to use your final move on her, right?

557
00:39:14,886 --> 00:39:15,854
Fine.

558
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,155
I'm going to call her right now.

559
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:18,857
I'll make her give up tonight.

560
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:21,192
Will she come here?

561
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,328
Ah Si,

562
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:26,764
girls would do everything
we asked them to do in the past.

563
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:28,333
Really?

564
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,768
Your Princess Yesha is the only exception.

565
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:31,970
Hello.

566
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,404
This is Meizuo.

567
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:34,572
I'm with my buddies now.

568
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:36,441
-Let's have a fiancée vs fiancée.
-Come and join us.

569
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:37,709
You should get Yesha here, too.

570
00:39:51,923 --> 00:39:53,458
Why do you have such a big appetite today?

571
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:56,227
It's because I didn't have lunch today.

572
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:58,296
You didn't have lunch?

573
00:39:58,363 --> 00:39:59,397
Why?

574
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:01,866
Because...

575
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:05,603
Because...

576
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:12,176
<i>Brave Yesha.</i>

577
00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:19,250
I'm with Shancai now,

578
00:40:19,317 --> 00:40:20,318
I'm busy.

579
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:27,125
It's Ah Xing.

580
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:34,599
Your ringtone is so cute.

581
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,280
Why did you do that?

582
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,683
I've always wanted to change it.

583
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:53,251
That ringtone is so embarrassing.

584
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,427
You haven't told me
why you didn't have lunch today?

585
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:06,631
I was too busy to have lunch.

586
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:10,068
Where are you going to go?

587
00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:13,404
I want to buy some books.

588
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,073
I will read them
when I can't sleep at night.

589
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,508
Okay. Let's head for the bookstore
after finishing this.

590
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:35,860
What's the matter?

591
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:37,628
She can't join us again?

592
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:39,664
She's with Shancai.

593
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,700
Whenever they are together,

594
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:43,768
I feel like the extra one.

595
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,104
Yesha is with Shancai?

596
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:47,772
Yeah.

597
00:41:48,406 --> 00:41:49,240
What?

598
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,476
It's nothing.

599
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:54,278
It's just that they are...

600
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:58,516
They're what?

601
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:00,051
Why did you stop?

602
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:02,653
Never mind.

603
00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:04,555
It's not tonight's topic.

604
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,927
Right, I have something to ask you.

605
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:14,932
You didn't approve of the idea
that Shancai should work at my company.

606
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:16,300
Why?

607
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:20,104
Actually, we did.

608
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:22,473
We were afraid of Shancai being hurt.

609
00:42:24,509 --> 00:42:26,210
But Shancai is indeed a weed.

610
00:42:28,813 --> 00:42:30,748
The harder the situation is,
the stronger she becomes.

611
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:32,817
She is even friends
with you and Yesha now.

612
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:36,654
If we were put
in this embarrassing situation,

613
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:38,489
we would avoid you at all costs.

614
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:39,791
So you mean,

615
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:43,027
Shancai works at my company
with her secret scheme?

616
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:47,965
It's unfair for Shancai
to call it a scheme.

617
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:55,907
I think Shancai is strong enough
to choose another way to love you.

618
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:58,576
This is our Shancai.

619
00:42:58,643 --> 00:42:59,744
Dumb and cute at the same time.

620
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:05,416
Sorry I'm late.

621
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,051
Ying Xiaociao.

622
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:14,225
She is the daughter
of the president of Jundi Construction.

623
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:15,126
Hello.

624
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:19,097
Meizuo, why not introduce us?

625
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,241
The three of them are my best friends.

626
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:34,312
Let me tell you how good they are.

627
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,349
If the three of them and you fell
into the sea,

628
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:41,452
I would save them instead of you.

629
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:43,421
I can understand.

630
00:43:43,488 --> 00:43:46,090
I can swim, so you don't need
to worry about me.

631
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:52,029
Daoming Si,
the third generation of Daoming Corp.

632
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:56,701
Hello.

633
00:43:57,168 --> 00:43:58,002
Hello.

634
00:43:58,069 --> 00:43:59,137
I can swim too.

635
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:03,074
Huaze Lei,

636
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:04,675
the son of Huaze Asset Insurance.

637
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:06,811
Hello.

638
00:44:06,878 --> 00:44:07,712
Hello.

639
00:44:08,713 --> 00:44:10,381
So are you good at swimming too?

640
00:44:12,183 --> 00:44:13,818
If we really fell into the water,

641
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:16,454
the only one Meizuo needs to save
would be himself.

642
00:44:17,722 --> 00:44:19,157
We can save ourselves.

643
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:22,793
Ximen, the next president of Ximen Corp.

644
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:23,728
Hello.

645
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:26,797
I attended your celebration party
on behalf of my father.

646
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:29,834
My father told me
your performance at work is outstanding.

647
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:34,238
He believes that you'll be a capable
corporation leader in the future.

648
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:36,007
Thank you for your kind words.

649
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:37,775
I heard you can play great cello.

650
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:39,610
-Thank you.
-Take a seat.

651
00:44:49,754 --> 00:44:50,855
What would you like to drink?

652
00:45:01,332 --> 00:45:04,268
I'd like to have a toast to all of you.
I'm so happy that I can attend your party.

653
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,878
Don't be so pumped up.

654
00:45:13,945 --> 00:45:19,150
We just had a bet on who can get
his chick here with a call.

655
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:22,220
I didn't know you're so obedient to me.

656
00:45:23,254 --> 00:45:25,723
Really? It is my honor.

657
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,861
Since you're so obedient,

658
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:32,897
and you showed me great respect
in front of my buddies,

659
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:35,833
I think I should give you a present.

660
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:17,568
