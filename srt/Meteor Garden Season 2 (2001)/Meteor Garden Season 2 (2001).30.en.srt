Registered mail.

2
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:05,993
Who is it for?

3
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:07,761
-Mr. Sha.
-I see.

4
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,771
Thank you.

5
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:24,244
<i>Sha.</i>

6
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:29,049
<i>Prague's winter is so beautiful,
it makes me not want to leave.</i>

7
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:32,619
<i>What a shame. I still have to leave.</i>

8
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:36,823
<i>Don't laugh at my ugly handwriting.</i>

9
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:40,394
<i>There are some urgent things
that I need to tell you.</i>

10
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,431
<i>There are some wishes
that I can only rely on you to fulfill.</i>

11
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:47,067
<i>Because you're my beloved Sha.</i>

12
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,703
<i>Nothing is too hard for you.</i>

13
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:55,075
<i>Actually, I knew Ah Si regained
his memories a long time ago.</i>

14
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,779
<i>And I realized how deep his love is
for Shancai.</i>

15
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:03,650
<i>When I had to face that problem,</i>

16
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,353
<i>I couldn't take it.</i>

17
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:08,822
<i>That's why I greedily accepted</i>

18
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:12,659
<i>Ah Si's hesitation and traveled with him
on the last days of my life.</i>

19
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:18,765
<i>I was just pretending
to be brave and strong.</i>

20
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:20,434
<i>I pretended that I didn't care.</i>

21
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:24,037
<i>Actually, I can't face the past.</i>

22
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:27,407
<i>That's why I draw people's backs.</i>

23
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,977
<i>So that everyone
that I love won't leave my sight.</i>

24
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:36,750
<i>But the funny thing is, when life is lost,</i>

25
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,819
<i>nothing is meaningful anymore.</i>

26
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,890
<i>Ah Si went with me
from one city to another.</i>

27
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,893
<i>Seeing the beauty of the world,</i>

28
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,230
<i>I finally realized why God allowed me</i>

29
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:52,699
<i>to be a part of Shancai and Ah Si's story.</i>

30
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,905
<i>As it turns out, God wants me
to learn Shancai's strength and braveness.</i>

31
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,710
<i>I realized that that's
what I've always wanted to be.</i>

32
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,114
<i>I suddenly understood.</i>

33
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,583
<i>I suddenly had an epiphany.</i>

34
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,885
<i>I want to continue living.</i>

35
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,587
<i>I have to continue living.</i>

36
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,858
<i>And I shouldn't just want
or think about it.</i>

37
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,993
<i>I have to work hard on it.</i>

38
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:24,064
<i>Thinking about how my father and our tribe</i>

39
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,566
<i>are praying for me by the sea every day,</i>

40
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,037
<i>thinking about the encouragement
that you, Shancai, and Ah Si gave me,</i>

41
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,540
<i>how can I just weakly let</i>

42
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,343
<i>my life slip away?</i>

43
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,211
<i>How can I do that?</i>

44
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:41,248
<i>Sha.</i>

45
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:45,118
<i>Please don't cry while reading my letter.</i>

46
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:48,054
<i>Because I'm already back in Bhutan.</i>

47
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:53,193
<i>Because my faith finally moved God.</i>

48
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:56,296
<i>The bone marrow is a match.</i>

49
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:01,268
<i>While I'm receiving treatment,</i>

50
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:02,969
<i>Sha,</i>

51
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,607
<i>I can only leave Ah Si
and Shancai's happiness in your hands.</i>

52
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,044
<i>I know you won't let me down.</i>

53
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:15,615
<i>I also know that at this time next year,</i>

54
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:19,085
<i>you and I will be drinking
a big bottle of red wine</i>

55
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,288
<i>at Barcelona's winery.</i>

56
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,760
<i>I remember you told me before
that someday, when I leave you,</i>

57
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,229
<i>you'll watch my back as I leave.</i>

58
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:32,866
<i>Now, I'm leaving you the drawing
of my back.</i>

59
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:38,038
<i>And the back that you see now
won't ever leave again.</i>

60
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:42,909
<i>I once loved Ah Xing,
a boy who lost his way.</i>

61
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:47,881
<i>In the end, I became good friends
with the loving Ah Si.</i>

62
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:51,284
<i>I really love how God planned this.</i>

63
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,955
<i>Because I know that the Daoming Si,</i>

64
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,857
<i>who has both the seriousness
of Ah Xing towards life</i>

65
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,894
<i>and the against all odds attitude
of Ah Si towards love,</i>

66
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:03,897
<i>is the only one who can give
Shancai real happiness.</i>

67
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,168
Okay, I will.

68
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,571
Thank you.

69
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,473
Thank you, God.

70
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,374
Thank you, Allah.

71
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:15,742
Thank you, Mother Mary.

72
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,010
Thank you, Buddha.

73
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,745
Thank you, Bodhisattva.

74
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,447
And all the gods in heaven.

75
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,682
Thank you to all of you.

76
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,394
<i>That lady in black over there.
I don't think we've met her.</i>

77
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:11,064
She's Ying Xiaociao, the daughter
of the president of Jundi Construction.

78
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,933
She just graduated from the US.

79
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,939
Another precious pretty face
with no brain.

80
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:25,912
That slap was for disrespecting me
even after I've shown you respect.

81
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,820
Come back quickly. What are you doing?

82
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,623
Leave it there! I don't need it anymore!

83
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,636
You know this should be
something that a man initiates.

84
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,090
Thank you for coming tonight.

85
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,726
This is my first concert in Taiwan.

86
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:14,627
To me,

87
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,230
aside from it being a milestone
in my study of music,

88
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:18,732
this has another special meaning.

89
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,334
Before I play my encore song,

90
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:25,138
please let me tell you the story
between me and my cello.

91
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:32,345
When I was younger,
I secretly liked a guy.

92
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:37,450
I was always silently watching him play
with his buddies from afar.

93
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:42,188
I've always hoped for him
to turn back and notice me.

94
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:46,793
Then I went to study music in the US.

95
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,195
Every time I think of him,

96
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,698
I pour my feelings by playing the cello.

97
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,734
But after coming back here to Taiwan,

98
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:58,304
I realized
that he doesn't remember me anymore.

99
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,141
Even so,

100
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:06,479
I'm still very grateful
that he unleashed my passion

101
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,048
for love and music.

102
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:13,219
So today, I want to dedicate
this last song to him.

103
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:17,557
Because this is his favorite
"world-famous music."

104
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,754
<i>Meizuo, what do you want to listen to?</i>

105
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,490
<i>I'll have Xiaociao play it for you.</i>

106
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:08,728
<i>The world's famous,</i>

107
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:10,797
<i>"Doraemon."</i>

108
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,884
At that time,

109
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,486
you always had two braids.

110
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,856
You were wearing huge glasses.

111
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,393
That's why you won't even look at me.

112
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,929
You fell in love at 12 years old.

113
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,164
Aren't you too mature?

114
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,135
No.

115
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:52,138
Who told you to be so cute
at 12 years old?

116
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,209
I finally understood.

117
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,013
I understand now why you're always
playing pranks on me.

118
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,815
Because I let you wait for me
since you were 12, right?

119
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:05,818
Then what are you waiting for?

120
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,554
What?

121
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:11,691
You told me yourself.

122
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:13,826
There are some things

123
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,495
that a man should initiate.

124
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,314
I heard something.

125
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,817
So I knew you must be back.

126
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,823
Even though the men I hired
told me that they couldn't find you,

127
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:16,696
I still believed that you'll come back.

128
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,433
I've also been waiting
for you to come back.

129
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:22,902
I just came back to get my things.

130
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:26,372
Ah Si.

131
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,841
You should get yourself together.

132
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:32,378
We're still waiting for you
to take over Daoming Corp.

133
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,747
You can have it for yourself.

134
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:35,648
I'm not interested.

135
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:39,452
What did you say?

136
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:44,824
I won't be coming back.

137
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:50,663
I came here today

138
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:53,532
to tell you my final decision.

139
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,739
Love doesn't exist
in the world you control.

140
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,143
There's only power.

141
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:07,380
Profit.

142
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:12,718
And yourself.

143
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,357
A mother who can use someone else's life

144
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:22,828
and her son's happiness

145
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,365
in exchange for profit.

146
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,304
Who doesn't care
whether her own son lives or dies.

147
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,307
You should just

148
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,178
treat me like I'm dead.

149
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:53,159
Take care of yourself.

150
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:56,495
Ah Si.

151
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,464
Ah Si!

152
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,168
Ah Si!

153
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:05,604
Stop!

154
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,908
I told you to stop, do you hear me?

155
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:13,979
All right, go.

156
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,515
Continue throwing your fit.

157
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:21,454
When you've suffered and failed enough,
you'll come back to me.

158
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:25,891
You're right.

159
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,694
I haven't had enough failures.

160
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,232
But someone like you who has never failed

161
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,670
probably don't know
that the more you fail,

162
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:40,339
the stronger you become.

163
00:20:58,924 --> 00:20:59,825
Ah Si.

164
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,628
You will be back.

165
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,298
You are my son.

166
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,068
You will be back.

167
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,346
Ah Xing.

168
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:06,685
Sha.

169
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:09,955
You live here alone.

170
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:13,292
How can you create such a mess?

171
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:16,395
There's nothing I can do.

172
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:20,232
I have to cook. I have to drink with you.

173
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:21,400
And I have to make friends.

174
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:24,970
Sometimes, when I meet someone
that I like,

175
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:26,939
I even have to think of a way
to hold her hand.

176
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:28,207
I'm so busy.

177
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:33,078
Sha, you really haven't changed at all.

178
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:38,984
Do you really think

179
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:44,023
that you've changed just
by making yourself look like a drifter?

180
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:48,427
You think you can really change

181
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:52,164
by not contacting and hiding from us?

182
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:57,569
I'm not hiding from you.

183
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:04,009
After traveling around with Yesha,

184
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,415
I realized that this kind of life
is actually more fulfilling.

185
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:12,618
And it's very simple.

186
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,422
If you're hungry,

187
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,424
you can do part-time jobs.

188
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:21,327
If you're tired,

189
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:24,630
just find a place to sleep in.

190
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,534
When you're lonely,

191
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:31,470
like you,

192
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:33,172
you can just make friends.

193
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:35,841
But don't hold their hands.

194
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:37,476
Hold hands?

195
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,013
I held a kid's hand
when I crossed the street.

196
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:50,489
Ah Si.

197
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:53,726
Since you like traveling so much,
can you help me?

198
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:15,681
A long time ago,

199
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:21,220
I've already wanted to dig a hole

200
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,389
and bury this ring.

201
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,926
But I was afraid that the hole
wouldn't be deep enough.

202
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:30,496
If someone finds it, it'll harm them.

203
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,069
If you go to the Pacific Ocean someday,

204
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,239
please find a deep spot

205
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,341
and throw it away.

206
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:08,634
The ring is back in your hands again.

207
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,204
Do whatever you want with it.

208
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,508
Before you throw it away,

209
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:18,710
whether you think it's lucky or unlucky,

210
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,913
that's up to you.

211
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,724
When are you leaving?

212
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:38,597
In a day or two.

213
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:41,967
Promise me.

214
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:45,170
Before you leave, drink with me first.

215
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:50,476
I think you really miss
my three-cup squid.

216
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:54,913
Here.

217
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:22,808
Sha.

218
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:24,576
How can we finish all of this?

219
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:29,414
Smell this first.

220
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:32,417
Wow, it smells so good.

221
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,186
-Wow.
-There's only two of us.

222
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:39,424
Who says there's only two of us?

223
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,193
What?

224
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:48,233
-Welcome.
-Is this how you're going to welcome us?

225
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,571
The moment we got Sha's call,
we immediately called Lei in Japan

226
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:54,139
then picked him up at the airport.

227
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,375
We spent a total of...

228
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,510
Three hours and 40 minutes.

229
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,880
How is that possible?
How can you go that fast?

230
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:03,081
What did you ride?

231
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:06,852
How did you know?
We picked him up in a helicopter.

232
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,188
That's right.

233
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:10,389
By the way,

234
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,292
Meizuo's flying skill...

235
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:15,594
it's quite bad.

236
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:16,662
What?

237
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:20,065
Just blame everything on Ah Si, okay?

238
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:21,300
He's not acting like our friend.

239
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,968
It doesn't matter
that you came back secretly.

240
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,403
You also want to leave secretly.

241
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:25,304
That's right.

242
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,173
It seems like he doesn't
really care about F4.

243
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:32,144
What should we do?
How should we punish him?

244
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:34,246
What do you think, Lei?

245
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:38,417
Let's beat him up.

246
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,186
You're going to beat me up?

247
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,854
What do you think of me?

248
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,991
Are you saying that we can't beat you up?
What do you think of us?

249
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:48,727
-Let's beat him up.
-Let's beat him up.

250
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:51,263
My turn.

251
00:28:58,437 --> 00:28:59,404
All right.

252
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:00,706
Let's eat while the food's hot.

253
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,074
-Come on.
-Let's eat.

254
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,575
Come on. You had a hard time coming here.

255
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:07,346
-Here.
-Here.

256
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,047
Let's drink our hearts out.

257
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,283
-For our reunion.
-And for tomorrow's separation.

258
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,184
To F4.

259
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,160
-It's still hot.
-Wow, it's still hot.

260
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,396
You have to try this.
This is my specialty.

261
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:26,198
-Try it.
-Here.

262
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,267
This cuttlefish ball is great.

263
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,303
-It's delicious.
-It's delicious, Sha.

264
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:33,505
That sauce.

265
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,407
<i>It's delicious.</i>

266
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:36,842
<i>That sauce is great.</i>

267
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:30,629
Why are you all alone here?

268
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:33,598
To get some air.

269
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:38,603
Is Ximen and Meizuo drunk already?

270
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:40,372
They're about to be.

271
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:47,946
You... came back alone?

272
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,681
Yes.

273
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:51,883
Then...

274
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,520
You want to ask about Shancai, right?

275
00:30:59,091 --> 00:31:00,425
She's going to Japan tomorrow.

276
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:02,060
You just came back
and she's going to Japan?

277
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,097
Aren't you supposed to go together?

278
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,234
Don't you know Shancai at all?

279
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:13,505
She's working at a travel agency.

280
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:16,808
This is her first time
to bring a group to Japan.

281
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:20,345
She's with you,
and she still needs to work at...

282
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:21,780
Wait.

283
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:26,351
Haven't she suffered enough?

284
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,587
Hey. If you love her,
you have to make her happy.

285
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:29,688
You have to take care of her,

286
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:31,390
-make her happy. Why--
-Why are you so intense?

287
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:37,028
Why are you always so intense
when it comes to Shancai?

288
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,466
Aren't you leaving already?

289
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:45,003
Why should it matter to you

290
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,874
whether Shancai is happy or not?

291
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,094
There is only

292
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:11,696
one person

293
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,066
who can make

294
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:18,136
Shancai happy.

295
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:24,810
So what?

296
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:27,279
This is our destiny.

297
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:35,020
You...

298
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:36,288
You think it's unfair, right?

299
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:38,924
You want to fight back, right?

300
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,261
Destiny punched you in the face.

301
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,932
Why aren't you fighting back?

302
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,178
Destiny is in your hands.

303
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,082
If you don't have the guts to fight back,

304
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:07,552
then just throw that away.

305
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:12,591
Lei.

306
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,368
What should I say to you?

307
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,072
You don't have to say anything.

308
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,307
That's what friends do.

309
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:45,757
Honey, what time is it?

310
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,327
Seven thirty.

311
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:50,762
What?

312
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:52,430
It's 7:30 a.m.?

313
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:56,601
I set the alarm to 5:00 a.m. yesterday.

314
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:00,238
Oh, you must have been the stupid one
who turned the alarm off!

315
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:04,576
Look. I couldn't even turn
on the bed because of you.

316
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:06,044
How can I turn off the alarm?

317
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:07,445
Gosh.

318
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:09,915
It's a beautiful morning.
Why are you in such a bad mood?

319
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:20,091
Our daughter is bringing a group
to Japan today.

320
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:21,826
If she's late because of you,

321
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,329
don't think about eating breakfast
for a month.

322
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:25,764
Shancai.

323
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,700
It's better if you don't make breakfast.

324
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,535
I don't want
to eat leftovers with porridge.

325
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:32,470
I'm already tired of it.

326
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:33,371
Shancai.

327
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:35,073
It's 7:30 a.m.

328
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:36,641
-Shancai!
-Shancai.

329
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:39,110
Hey. Shancai!

330
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:40,712
Shancai.

331
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:43,715
Where's Shancai?

332
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,620
Shancai didn't come home yesterday.

333
00:34:49,154 --> 00:34:50,388
You lost your head.

334
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:51,289
Well...

335
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:57,329
We even helped Shancai pack her luggage
before going to bed last night.

336
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,164
No. Really?

337
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,599
Well, then...

338
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,343
<i>Dad and Mom.</i>

339
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,211
<i>I was reluctant to wake you up.</i>

340
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:14,446
<i>I'll go ahead.</i>

341
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,748
<i>How strange.</i>

342
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:18,717
<i>I already miss home.</i>

343
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,387
<i>I'm just bringing a group
to Japan for five days.</i>

344
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:23,555
<i>Don't worry.</i>

345
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:26,191
<i>I'll happily go on this trip.</i>

346
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:27,592
<i>And come home safely.</i>

347
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:33,264
<i>So mom, please don't be so dramatic again.</i>

348
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:39,337
<i>There's something
I've always wanted to tell you.</i>

349
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,674
<i>I'm really happy that you're my parents,</i>

350
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:43,908
<i>and not anyone else.</i>

351
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:48,146
<i>Although we've always been poor,</i>

352
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,684
<i>looking at you two laugh and cry everyday</i>

353
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:55,987
<i>makes me feel that we can surpass
anything in this world.</i>

354
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:00,125
<i>Although I'm destined to be a weed,</i>

355
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:02,127
<i>an unnoticeable weed,</i>

356
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:05,797
<i>I'm the strongest weed.</i>

357
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:07,432
<i>So,</i>

358
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:09,701
<i>I want to thank you for giving life to me.</i>

359
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:11,936
<i>Thank you.</i>

360
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:17,575
Our daughter is thanking us.

361
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:21,312
Shancai is all grown up.

362
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,615
She's really all grown up.

363
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:27,352
From now on,

364
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:30,288
we have to be serious parents.

365
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,791
Don't always joke around, okay?

366
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,460
Our daughter is all grown up.

367
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,996
We should grow up too.

368
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:47,706
Since you're all grown up,

369
00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:51,209
honey, from now on,

370
00:36:51,276 --> 00:36:54,746
you can use your own clothes
to wipe your tears and snot!

371
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,214
I see.

372
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:57,916
Well... it's not...

373
00:36:58,516 --> 00:36:59,751
Honey.

374
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:02,554
They say men's tears are very precious.

375
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:04,789
I'm giving that to you now.

376
00:37:05,457 --> 00:37:07,759
And it's a very precious gift.

377
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:10,628
Gift your face!

378
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:14,599
Since we got married,
all you've given me are junk.

379
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:18,403
-No, I...
-Even you yourself are junk.

380
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,371
I may be junk.

381
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:23,541
But you're someone who knows
how to recycle junk well.

382
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:25,677
Right? And you've been using
recycled junk for years.

383
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:26,778
Isn't it nice?

384
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,688
-Qiu Yuxin.
-Here.

385
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,656
-This is your plane ticket.
-You're welcome.

386
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:40,191
Qiu Qiongyi.

387
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:41,659
Here.

388
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:44,963
Wu Yijing.

389
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:47,132
-Wu Yijing.
-This is Wu Yijing's.

390
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:50,769
<i>I won't tell you where Shancai is.</i>

391
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:54,539
<i>I won't be stupid enough
to let you hurt Shancai again.</i>

392
00:37:55,573 --> 00:38:00,712
<i>I won't tell you
that Shancai's taking the 9:30 a.m. flight</i>

393
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:02,480
<i>to bring a group to Japan.</i>

394
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:04,149
<i>I'm warning you.</i>

395
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,051
<i>If you have a conscience,</i>

396
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,988
<i>go and find her now.</i>

397
00:38:31,276 --> 00:38:33,511
-Airport, please.
-Hey, this is my cab.

398
00:38:33,578 --> 00:38:34,679
Did I ask your opinion?

399
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:37,048
Yes, this is my cab. I called for it.

400
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:46,257
Hello, I'm Shancai.

401
00:38:48,393 --> 00:38:49,360
What?

402
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:52,597
Xiaodu has appendicitis?

403
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:55,133
You want me to take over?

404
00:38:58,736 --> 00:38:59,571
Yes.

405
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:02,974
That's right. I've been to Barcelona.

406
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:05,376
But what should we do with this group?

407
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:15,186
All right.

408
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:28,900
-Shancai.
-Yes.

409
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:31,069
I'm going to take the Japan group.
This is your new ticket.

410
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:32,070
Thank you.

411
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:37,709
-Do you have the Japan ticket?
-Yes.

412
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:40,044
Hurry. The flight to Barcelona
will board in an hour.

413
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:41,045
That fast?

414
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:43,181
Okay. Two group members
aren't back from the restroom.

415
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:44,282
Wait for them here.

416
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:45,984
-Okay, I'll take care of it. Hurry.
-All right.

417
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:46,951
-Bye.
-Okay, bye.

418
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:55,393
Sorry, I'm not late, right?

419
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,595
-Your passport and plane ticket.
-Thank you.

420
00:39:58,296 --> 00:40:00,031
-Do you have any check-in luggage?
-None.

421
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:03,501
May I ask if you have a tour group today?

422
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,036
Yes, we have one daily.

423
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:18,283
Yes.

424
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,351
You're boarding at gate one.
Boarding time is 9:40 a.m.

425
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,853
-Hurry and board now.
-Okay.

426
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,921
-Happy trip.
-Thank you.

427
00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:36,734
<i>Shancai and Daoming Si missed
each other again.</i>

428
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,469
<i>Will their love that's full of setbacks</i>

429
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:40,571
<i>pass each other by again</i>

430
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:42,707
<i>or will they have a happy ending?</i>

431
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,077
<i>Continue watching
at the same time tomorrow</i>

432
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:49,314
<i>for Meteor Garden II's amazing ending.</i>

433
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:03,161
BLOOPER

434
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:05,063
So, the pan of... The plan of engagement.

435
00:41:07,432 --> 00:41:08,566
The pan of...

436
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:24,248
It tastes good, actually.

437
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:27,285
Of course I'm pissed off.

438
00:41:27,385 --> 00:41:30,254
Ying is merely a pretty face
who opposes us.

439
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:34,959
I thought we were just...

440
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:36,794
I thought we were just hating each other.

441
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:50,908
Why can't we just do that?

442
00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:54,245
He loves her.

443
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:55,646
He makes her happy.

444
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,315
They kissed each other.

445
00:41:57,382 --> 00:41:58,483
So, he loves her.

446
00:41:58,549 --> 00:41:59,684
Right.

447
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:11,396
I can't drink much.

448
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:14,198
That's it for me after this one glass.

449
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:15,867
I think...

450
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:19,337
I think I won't bother you any longer.

451
00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:20,538
It's funny.

452
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:22,240
What are you laughing at?

453
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:23,941
Why are you biting me?

454
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:25,143
It hurts!

455
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,678
Action.

456
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:29,981
Action.

457
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,449
Hey.

458
00:42:32,517 --> 00:42:34,318
It's up to you...

459
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:36,888
We must ask for Sha's phone number.

460
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:37,989
Daoming Si.

461
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,892
You do know I'm Chen Qinghe, right?

462
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:43,361
What are you doing,
son of the nouveau riche?

463
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:46,898
He even knows... me.

464
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,701
Here?

465
00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:52,470
Please dance.

466
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:04,549
One, two, three, action!

467
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:09,120
Are you serious?

468
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:11,122
Are you serious?

469
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,624
Our director is just crazy.

470
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:24,635
Welcome back, madam.

471
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:26,037
It is all ready now.

472
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:27,905
Is your young master all right?

473
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:30,308
This is my report.

474
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:32,110
The young master is...

475
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:43,087
This is just an agreement
between you and that old witch.

476
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,759
I forgot my lines.

477
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:52,597
Oh, my.

478
00:44:00,505 --> 00:44:02,507
