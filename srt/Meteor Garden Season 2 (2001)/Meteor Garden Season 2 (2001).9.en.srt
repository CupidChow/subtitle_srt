1
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:07,794
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

2
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,133
Why did you come here again?

3
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,802
I'm looking for a job.

4
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:17,571
I told you yesterday...

5
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,341
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

6
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,510
She's hot.

7
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,152
-Please take a seat, young lady.
-A table for one?

8
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:35,989
What would you like?

9
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:37,491
I'll have a fried egg.

10
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:38,525
Fried egg. Got it.

11
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,093
I want him to cook the fried egg.

12
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:41,695
Him...

13
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,897
But he isn't actually our...

14
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:45,499
Let me explain.

15
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,234
Young lady.

16
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:49,169
Please allow me to explain.

17
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:51,304
This person.

18
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,773
He doesn't work here.

19
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:54,608
He also doesn't...

20
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,845
You are...

21
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:02,182
-He's your...
-All right, Da Xin, save your breath.

22
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,851
Ok...

23
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,620
Ah Xing, right?

24
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:08,855
Go cook a fried egg for her.

25
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,331
He's good.

26
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,000
He's getting better.

27
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,334
Not bad.

28
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:28,942
Please, enjoy your meal.

29
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,863
Am I hired?

30
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,035
For the sake of your pretty girlfriend,

31
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,805
-You're hired.
-Hey...

32
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:00,774
Who's the boss? You or me?

33
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,510
What?

34
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:05,779
Of course I refuse.

35
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:07,314
Why?

36
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,517
Because... I'm the boss.

37
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,219
What I said is what I meant.

38
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:16,456
Not even for the sake of your girlfriend?

39
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,828
Yi Lin, talk with him...

40
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,168
Forget it, Ye Sha.

41
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,369
Let's go.

42
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:33,306
Don't get upset about it.

43
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:34,941
You tried your best.

44
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:36,710
That's the most important thing.

45
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:40,080
Let's go.

46
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,184
Ah Xing.

47
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,724
If he won't hire you, I will.

48
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:52,592
I'm the boss's wife.

49
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,395
I'm the one in charge here.

50
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,200
This kind of hardworking guy
is what we need.

51
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,805
Why are you still standing there?

52
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,006
Go wash the dishes.

53
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:12,212
Thank you, madam.

54
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,148
Thank you, boss.

55
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,551
-Thank you...
-What did you "hmph" about?

56
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,522
Take a seat. You haven't finished the egg.

57
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:23,723
Sit down...

58
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,058
Would you like something else?

59
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,226
I can cook you a better one.

60
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,095
Stop flattering her. Get ready for work!

61
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:31,898
And you.

62
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:32,933
What about me?

63
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,935
How about putting on more lipstick?

64
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,269
-Did I eat it?
-That's not fair.

65
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,839
A little bit here... here.

66
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:02,395
Wake up.

67
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,598
It's time to get to work.

68
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,134
Get to work.

69
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,077
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

70
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:16,169
-Come in...
-Welcome...

71
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,384
Iced coffee.

72
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:32,652
Got it. Coming up.

73
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:56,109
VALENTINE'S DAY CAKE ON SALE

74
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,830
Hi, here is your cake.

75
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,465
Thank you. That'll be 350 yuan please.

76
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,235
Your receipt, thank you.

77
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,005
Hello, happy Valentine's Day.
What flavor would you like?

78
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,040
-I'll have the strawberry one.
-One moment please.

79
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:28,041
Excuse me.

80
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,844
Hi, I'm sorry. Please, wait 3 minutes.
Okay, thank you.

81
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:32,746
Happy Valentine's Day.

82
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:33,847
What flavor would you like?

83
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:36,649
Shancai, happy Valentine's Day.

84
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:38,284
Qinghe.

85
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,253
Stop messing with me. I'm very busy today.

86
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,354
I'm not messing with you.

87
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:42,622
I've been in the queue forever.

88
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:43,757
I just want to chat with you.

89
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,892
People wait in the queue to buy cakes.

90
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,394
Stop wasting their time.

91
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,095
But I have something to tell you.

92
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,131
Not now. I'm very busy today.

93
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:54,401
Then... Will you go for dinner
with me tonight?

94
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:59,706
I think you should go for dinner
with my mom dressing like that.

95
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,908
How long will the chat go on, miss?

96
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:02,842
I'm sorry...

97
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,077
-I'm in a hurry.
-Qinghe, just go.

98
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:06,046
Hi.

99
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,917
I'll have a chocolate cake.

100
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,852
I'm sorry. The chocolate cake is sold out.

101
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,088
The lemon flavor is also
a perfect gift for her, too.

102
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:17,357
One moment please.

103
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,460
Shancai. I'll go home and change
before picking you up tonight.

104
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,095
Qinghe, please don't.

105
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:23,530
It's a full-day shift.

106
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:24,531
Thank you.

107
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:25,832
Today is Valentine's Day.

108
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,436
Two friends eating and chatting
is pretty "Valentine-ish", right?

109
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,071
Qinghe, I honestly can't.

110
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,539
Don't get in the way of my costumers.

111
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:34,307
Excuse me, that'll be 350 yuan, please.

112
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,109
Thank you. This is 500 yuan.

113
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:37,977
Shancai, I'll stick to the plan.

114
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,279
I've booked the table.

115
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,948
There's this quiet little restaurant.

116
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,049
We can set off fireworks.

117
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,150
Have a barbeque.

118
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:45,285
Romance guaranteed.

119
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,619
So you will stop brooding.

120
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:47,921
Where's that restaurant?

121
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,622
That "restaurant" is his house.

122
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,291
I promise you, you won't want to go there.

123
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,926
Your cake, thank you.

124
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:53,960
Shancai, you're awesome.

125
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:55,161
How did you know it's my house?

126
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:57,597
Then... I'll pick you up tonight.

127
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:01,101
Qinghe, I have to work the whole day.

128
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,602
I don't have time to brood over things.

129
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:03,503
And I can't leave here.

130
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,805
Happy Valentine's Day.
What flavor would you like?

131
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,574
-The strawberry one.
-One moment please.

132
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:09,943
The strawberry cake is sold out.
One moment please.

133
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,216
This isn't how it works.

134
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,119
Don't badmouth me like that.

135
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,354
Or what?

136
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:22,789
Nothing.

137
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:23,957
I'm just pissed off.

138
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:25,758
Then leave.

139
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,328
What am I to you?

140
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:33,133
I won't leave until after I finish
washing the dishes.

141
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:35,535
I won't let you wash them.

142
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:37,737
Then I won't leave.

143
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:38,938
-What now?
-What now?

144
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:41,007
Are you done fighting?

145
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,976
Who will wash the dishes?

146
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,177
I will do it.

147
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,545
I will go wash them. Stop fighting.

148
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:32,392
Thank you.

149
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:34,961
This is my first salary.

150
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:39,032
Well, that's new.

151
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,935
In fact, you can't get a salary
before working for a whole month.

152
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:45,505
But you're lucky that it is
Valentine's Day or something.

153
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,707
I did this for your girlfriend.

154
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,144
You two make a good couple.

155
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,879
Why are others so lucky?

156
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,481
I'm jealous now.

157
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:57,951
Actually, Yesha isn't my girlfriend.

158
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:58,851
-She...
-Give it back.

159
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,254
This is your fault.

160
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:06,259
Grab the chance
while our kind boss is compassionate.

161
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:07,260
Go and woo her.

162
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:09,662
Don't let our boss down
and break his heart.

163
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,231
Right, boss?

164
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,466
Quit babbling. Give it back.

165
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:14,634
-Give it back.
-Give it to me.

166
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:17,003
-How could you? Give it back.
-Give it back to me.

167
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,506
Haven't you two played enough,
Snoopy's siblings?

168
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,441
What's that?

169
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,675
Stupid.

170
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,645
Give it to me.

171
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,752
Woo her or not,

172
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:35,588
you get your salary,
so you should thank her for that.

173
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,891
Don't forget that she got you this job.

174
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:40,927
I will.

175
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,763
I want to thank Yesha.

176
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:49,402
I'm thinking what I should do
to thank her.

177
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,839
What do you think I should do?

178
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,276
Situations like this...

179
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,111
I think...

180
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,747
Make her something...

181
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,955
Right...

182
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:14,827
Cook her a Valentine's Day dinner.

183
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,562
This is...

184
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,466
No...

185
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,668
Why not?

186
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,536
-Of course you can't.
-Of course you can't.

187
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,271
Why?

188
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:26,773
You can't even cook fried eggs.

189
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,541
Why... I...

190
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,143
But I can do it now.

191
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,913
Da Xin, Ah Lun, Yilin, don't you agree?

192
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:49,262
Look at you, I...
I can't stand seeing you like this.

193
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,433
I, the Kitchen King Da Xin.

194
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,668
I, the Kitchen Supreme God Ah Lun.

195
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,804
The Kitchen Witch, Yilin.

196
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,507
We'll teach you with everything we've got.

197
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:09,649
Teach what?

198
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:15,388
Spaghetti with clams.

199
00:14:58,464 --> 00:14:59,332
Granny...

200
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,734
Granny, do you have "Stir fry aroma"?

201
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:03,269
Granny...

202
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,072
Granny...

203
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:08,941
Granny...

204
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:10,877
Do you have "stir fry"?

205
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:13,446
Stir fry what?

206
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,115
Stir... stir that fry.

207
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:24,157
Boil tomatoes and peel them.

208
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,667
You won't finish cutting
doing it like that.

209
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,336
Give it to me.

210
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,206
Then what should I do?

211
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,912
Open this and wash away the sand.

212
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,682
Open the clam and remove the sand from it.

213
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:55,254
Remove...

214
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:03,830
Open and wash away the sand...

215
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,726
Granny, you're awesome.
You're cutting so fast.

216
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,731
Granny, what's wrong?

217
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,069
Did you remember some bad memories?

218
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,038
Give me the mask back.

219
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,012
What's this?

220
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:03,583
I opened and washed them.

221
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,018
It took me so long and it's hard to do.

222
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,386
I did it with a hammer.

223
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:10,289
I'll do it...

224
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:12,191
Then what should I do?

225
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:13,693
You wait.

226
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,702
I wanted to repay Yesha.

227
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,372
I messed up in the end.

228
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,373
I'm so stupid.

229
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:32,078
What you did was easy.

230
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,113
The next steps are the difficult ones.

231
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:37,883
You need to boil the soup for 2 hours.

232
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,419
It'll be bland if the fire is set too low.

233
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,154
It'll dry out if the fire is too high.

234
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:44,357
So... I don't think you can do it.

235
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:45,324
I'll do it.

236
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,226
Granny, I can... I can do this.

237
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:48,327
Two hours, remember.

238
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:49,528
Two hours.

239
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,330
Stir it every ten minutes.

240
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:52,798
Stir every ten minutes, got it.

241
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,835
You should apply some strength
but not too much or too little.

242
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:57,370
I can do it.

243
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:04,343
That's strange.

244
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:06,812
Why does it rain every Valentine's Day?

245
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:09,181
Raining?

246
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:10,850
It isn't, granny.

247
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:11,817
It's sunny outside.

248
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,855
My legs are more accurate
than weather forecasts.

249
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,755
Hi, Qinghe.

250
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:56,956
What are you up to?

251
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,397
Nouveau riche?

252
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:06,799
What's the matter?

253
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:33,425
I can do it myself.

254
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:35,961
Thanks.

255
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:38,631
Cut to the chase.

256
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,065
How is Shancai doing?

257
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,001
Shancai is fine.

258
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,103
She is working, so...

259
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,104
So what?

260
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,406
Can you let me finish first
before beating me?

261
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:52,711
Then start talking.

262
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:58,584
You know today's Valentine's Day, right?

263
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:03,088
This is usually a day spent
with someone you love.

264
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:09,161
But with Daoming Si missing,

265
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:10,629
she must be feeling blue.

266
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:17,203
No one will be able to survive the
loneliness especially on Valentine's Day.

267
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:19,305
Plus her boyfriend is missing...

268
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:20,639
Get to the point, will you?

269
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:25,211
My point is,

270
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:30,316
all of us come together
and send Shancai a Valentine's Day gift

271
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:32,284
so we can fill the hole of Daoming Si.

272
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:35,020
Do you think it's important enough?

273
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:36,989
I see your sincerity.

274
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:42,394
Judging by your smug smile,
you've already thought of a gift?

275
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:43,829
Of course.

276
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:49,034
The gift sent by me and F3,
shouldn't be cheesy, right?

277
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:53,572
We won't choose rings, watches,

278
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:58,244
or anything that can be bought with money.

279
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,814
The most important thing is
to show our genuine friendship, right?

280
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:06,018
Let Shancai...

281
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:07,519
What kind of gift are you suggesting?

282
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,758
This gift should not be money

283
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:15,427
nor flowers or a card. It should be...

284
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:16,862
Come on.

285
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:19,798
Let's call the radio station
and request a song for Shancai.

286
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,403
Request a song?

287
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,542
It's...

288
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,177
Awesome, right?

289
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,914
I even got the script ready.

290
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:38,050
All you need to do is call
and read the script.

291
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:45,891
"Dear Shancai.

292
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:47,960
This is..."

293
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:54,533
"Meizuo who loves you."

294
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,509
"Ximen who cares about you."

295
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:24,530
"Lei who treasures you,

296
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:29,301
and Qinghe who has been standing
behind you since middle school.

297
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:32,104
This is a song for you.

298
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:36,008
On this Valentine's day without your love,
we hope you can...

299
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,410
forget the loneliness

300
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,612
and remember our friendship.

301
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:45,250
Sincerely, we wish you joy and beauty.

302
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,786
We were not a part of your past.

303
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:50,923
But we swear,

304
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,759
in the many days ahead,

305
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:59,231
we will run towards
a bright and happy future with Shancai."

306
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:01,133
How about that? Touching, right?

307
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:03,702
This is your special gift?

308
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:04,636
Yes.

309
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:07,973
If we read this together,
Shancai will be very moved.

310
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:11,844
Qinghe.

311
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,579
I'm already moved.

312
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:16,482
So I think I'll leave
this hard task to you.

313
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:19,418
I have a meeting later. I'll pay the bill.

314
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:20,953
Wait.

315
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:22,588
Don't you want to read it?

316
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,692
There's one more thing you can do for me.

317
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,194
Don't mention my name.

318
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:31,830
Wait...

319
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:33,298
This won't work. We are F3 plus one.

320
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,400
We leave no one behind.

321
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,669
In that case,
you can be our representative.

322
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:40,139
How could you?

323
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:41,473
Shancai must be lonely now.

324
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,641
She needs our care.

325
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:45,177
Don't you care about her?

326
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:49,882
We care about her.

327
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,550
But we'll do it in a different way.

328
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,321
But our concern won't reach Shancai
if we don't tell her.

329
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:01,827
You can read the script alone.

330
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:05,264
I'll remember to turn on
the radio tonight. Bye-bye.

331
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,835
Can't you just make an exception
for Shancai?

332
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:21,914
If you think this isn't touching enough,
I got a better one.

333
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:07,993
VALENTINE'S DAY CAKE SOLD OUT

334
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:44,563
Why are they not here?

335
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:58,911
"Please wear formal attire to the rooftop.

336
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:11,223
Please observe proper etiquette.

337
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:15,194
Formal attire is a must.

338
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,802
I know you don't have a gown..."

339
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,938
Oh, you got so many rules.

340
00:28:30,943 --> 00:28:36,114
"The rooftop is not allowed for
the poor girl that has no gown.

341
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,671
Sponsored by Granny."

342
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:06,278
It's so beautiful.

343
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:54,226
How many are you?

344
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,963
I didn't book a table.

345
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,366
That's fine. Are you okay with this table?

346
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,268
-Yeah.
-Yes, okay.

347
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:06,705
Please take your seat.

348
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:08,040
Thank you.

349
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:11,643
What would you like?

350
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:13,812
A steak will do.

351
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,115
I'm sorry. It's sold out.

352
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:21,119
Then... I'll have Eisbein.

353
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:23,121
Eisbein...

354
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,491
I'll tell you a secret.

355
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:28,393
The Eisbein in our restaurant
is disgusting.

356
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:34,433
Then what do you recommend?

357
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:37,869
How about our "Chef's Favorite"?

358
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,138
-Okay.
-Okay, one moment please.

359
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:45,744
Excuse me.

360
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,114
It's so pretty.

361
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:51,550
Did you cook it?

362
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:56,088
It's cooked by our chef.

363
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:59,191
Can I meet the chef?

364
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:03,695
But this is Da Xin's...

365
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,767
No problem. I'll arrange it.

366
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:10,235
Please wait one moment.

367
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:17,075
Did you call for me, miss?

368
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:24,516
A handsome and talented chef as expected.

369
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:26,418
Miss.

370
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:30,722
Well, can I ask our handsome
and talented chef a question?

371
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:35,427
How did you come up with
this romantic and pretty dish?

372
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:39,431
This is a long story. Can I sit here?

373
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:40,365
Yes.

374
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:44,069
Thank you.

375
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:04,723
Today is a special day.

376
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,995
I earned my first salary.

377
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:16,001
The feeling is so special.

378
00:32:18,837 --> 00:32:19,704
I'm very happy.

379
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:22,374
I'm very excited.

380
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,278
And very touched.

381
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:34,953
So... I thought of the person
who's been very important to me.

382
00:32:39,024 --> 00:32:40,358
She gave me a second life.

383
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:48,567
She protected me from a knife
and she saved me.

384
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:55,207
She could've left me alone in my sad past.

385
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:05,684
But instead, she chose
to waste her life with me.

386
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,124
I don't know how to thank her.

387
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,997
I haven't even cooked for her.

388
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,401
So I...

389
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:36,047
Did Da Xin teach you this speech, too?

390
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:39,684
No.

391
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,722
Then you should say it again later.

392
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:45,023
I want to memorize it.

393
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,767
What for?

394
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:57,736
Let's dance before eating.

395
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:02,674
I can't dance.

396
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:06,244
Didn't you just say
you wanted to thank me?

397
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,481
You should do whatever I tell you to do.

398
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,616
I've already cooked spaghetti for you.

399
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:12,550
What else do you want?

400
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:14,419
I want to dance.

401
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:19,424
You'll regret it.

402
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:20,325
No.

403
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:21,493
Come on.

404
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,094
Then you can't laugh.

405
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,230
Don't worry. I'll laugh behind your back.

406
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:37,475
Do you like it?

407
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,244
A nice bow tie, right?

408
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:40,745
It's so cute.

409
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,481
I spent a whole night making it.

410
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,050
Show some respect, okay?

411
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:27,525
<i>My dear friends, the rain is coming.</i>

412
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:30,028
<i>It's called "The Valentine's Day Rain".</i>

413
00:35:30,095 --> 00:35:32,464
<i>Why is it always raining
at Valentine's Day?</i>

414
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,100
<i>Why is god such a killjoy?</i>

415
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:38,670
<i>I think there must be a reason for this.</i>

416
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:41,439
<i>Everyone is holding
their umbrella in the rain.</i>

417
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:45,343
<i>Maybe there are so many new relationships
under those umbrellas.</i>

418
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:47,512
Let's see this fax.

419
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:50,248
This fax is from Xiaoting in Xindian.

420
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,552
<i>Xiaoting wants to tell Ah Ping
the following words.</i>

421
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:59,591
<i>I've liked you for a long time
but you never knew.</i>

422
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:02,761
<i>Please turn around
and notice me, will you?</i>

423
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:07,032
I believe, Ah Ping, you're always
looking straight ahead.

424
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,868
But you'll never look beside you.

425
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:13,638
In fact, the best things
and people are beside you.

426
00:36:15,073 --> 00:36:19,177
I hope all the friends
who want to show their loves,

427
00:36:19,244 --> 00:36:24,916
who want to apologize, and who want
to break up, fax me. I'm waiting for you.

428
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:27,452
Shancai.

429
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,656
Get in the car, come on.

430
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:32,924
Quick.

431
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:35,493
It's a good thing I'm here, right?

432
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,961
How did you know I was here?

433
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,730
I knew when you would get off work.

434
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:40,999
I was late and there was this rain.

435
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:43,468
I thought you would take shelter
from the rain without your umbrella.

436
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:45,036
So I was driving around looking for you.

437
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:46,838
What did you say?

438
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:49,074
Why did you turn the radio so high?

439
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:55,046
Nothing. I won't hear it
if I turn it down.

440
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:56,514
What's wrong with your ears?

441
00:36:58,116 --> 00:36:59,517
Nothing... Nothing.

442
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:02,053
Qinghe, what's the matter?

443
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,188
Why are you so nervously?

444
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,523
Yeah, why am I so nervous?

445
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:14,332
Most requests are songs
for lovers to express how they feel.

446
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:18,103
Every listener thinks
their love is the most special one.

447
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:22,373
But I think relationships
aren't any different.

448
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:29,781
But today I received a very special fax
that I want to share with you after ads.

449
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:37,455
Here we go...

450
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:39,090
What?

451
00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:42,026
Nothing. Shancai,
I'm want to drink a soda.

452
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,228
Wait for me here, be right back.

453
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:44,863
<i>A very special fax...</i>

454
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,265
-Qinghe!
<i>-from Qinghe in Taipei.</i>

455
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:50,335
<i>Qinghe hopes Shancai
can stay like Shancai forever.</i>

456
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:53,271
<i>Isn't it special?</i>

457
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:59,978
<i>Qinghe wants to tell Shancai,
"Do you remember, in the first grade,</i>

458
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:02,213
<i>Once, I failed my math exam.</i>

459
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,384
<i>The teacher said,
I'll beat your hand for every mistake.</i>

460
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:08,353
<i>I got 24 mistakes.</i>

461
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:11,389
<i>I was shivering in my seat.</i>

462
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,526
<i>When the teacher called me
I almost passed out.</i>

463
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:21,499
<i>Shancai, you raised up your hand, and told
the teacher to have half the punishment.</i>

464
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,802
<i>Our teacher asked why.</i>

465
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:26,971
<i>You said you didn't teach me enough.</i>

466
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:30,175
<i>So you had half the responsibility
when I failed.</i>

467
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:37,415
<i>I will always remember that afternoon
in which you shared half my punishment.</i>

468
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:44,189
<i>Shancai, I hope I can share
half your sorrow now.</i>

469
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:49,828
I hope I can share half of your sadness.

470
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:55,633
I hope that my Shancai, my good friend,
can find real happiness.

471
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,670
Your friend forever, Qinghe."

472
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:01,773
Shancai, did you know

473
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:05,743
Qinghe recorded this song for you.

474
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:07,712
"Close to You"

475
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:14,252
<i>Why do birds suddenly appear</i>

476
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:20,091
<i>Every time you are near?</i>

477
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:25,530
<i>Just like me, they long to be</i>

478
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:28,900
<i>Close to you</i>

479
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:37,542
<i>Why do stars fall down from the sky</i>

480
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:43,181
<i>Every time you walk by?</i>

481
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:48,653
<i>Just like me, they long to be</i>

482
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,523
<i>Close to you</i>

483
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,828
Qinghe.

484
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,029
What are you doing?

485
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:01,499
Get in.

486
00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:21,152
Thanks.

487
00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:29,193
For what?

488
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:30,962
F3 was right.

489
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:32,530
This was a bad idea.

490
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:33,698
I wanted to make you happy.

491
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:35,733
And now you are crying.

492
00:40:40,138 --> 00:40:42,507
I'm crying because I'm happy.

493
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:46,144
<i>We don't pick up audience calls.</i>

494
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,812
We'll make an exception today.

495
00:40:48,513 --> 00:40:49,847
Hello.

496
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:51,449
Shancai.

497
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,619
<i>You know I'm not good at this stuff.</i>

498
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,689
<i>But Qinghe is right this time.</i>

499
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:01,426
I think he's right.

500
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:02,660
You should express your concern.

501
00:41:03,995 --> 00:41:05,563
<i>So I'm telling you,</i>

502
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,031
<i>You're really ugly when you cry.</i>

503
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,568
<i>You're somewhat pretty
when you're smiling.</i>

504
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,971
So you know what to do.

505
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,340
Cry less, smile more.

506
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:17,942
That's it.

507
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:18,977
Happy Valentine's Day.

508
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:19,877
Goodbye.

509
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:23,748
<i>Deep fried Shancai!</i>

510
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:25,683
Meizuo.

511
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,051
<i>I'm rooting for you.</i>

512
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,120
Stay strong.

513
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:33,091
<i>Shancai, stay strong.</i>

514
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,227
<i>There's another one. Hello.</i>

515
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:41,132
<i>I'm Daoming Si.</i>

516
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,702
<i>My topic is "My Wish".</i>

517
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:49,941
<i>My wish is to protect dad, mom, sister,</i>

518
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:52,710
<i>Ximen, Meizuo, and Lei.</i>

519
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:55,113
<i>I'll protect my bride.</i>

520
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,448
<i>I'll keep them away from bad guys.</i>

521
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,584
<i>I won't let them be sad.</i>

522
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,552
<i>So I'll grow up fast.</i>

523
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:03,788
<i>This is my wish.</i>

524
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:08,386
GOOD MORNING, LAZY PIG

525
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:19,831
"Good morning, lazy pig."

526
00:43:31,509 --> 00:43:32,376
Excuse me.

527
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:35,379
-Thanks for coming.
-Thanks for coming...

528
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,414
How was it last night?

529
00:43:36,481 --> 00:43:38,015
-Thanks for coming.
-Thanks for coming...

530
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:39,083
How was what?

531
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,451
What happened last night?

532
00:43:40,518 --> 00:43:41,652
Nothing.

533
00:43:43,421 --> 00:43:45,756
-Thanks for coming.
-Thanks for coming.

534
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:50,094
Ah Xing, how about last night?

535
00:43:50,161 --> 00:43:51,062
What?

536
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:53,097
Stop pretending, tell us.

537
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:55,133
-How could I know?
-How was it?

538
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:56,801
Tell us, how was it?

539
00:43:56,868 --> 00:43:57,702
Go away.

540
00:43:58,703 --> 00:43:59,971
What are you doing?

541
00:44:04,609 --> 00:44:06,744
Well, how did it go last night?

542
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,080
Come on, tell us.

543
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:13,885
One omelette
and two fried eggs for table A.

544
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:16,354
