1
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,389
Come, it's your turn.

2
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,657
I don't know how to play.

3
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,125
You just play, Yesha, it's fine.

4
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,593
I'll teach you.

5
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,498
I really don't know how to play.

6
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:12,866
Listen to me.

7
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,736
Focus on what's before you.

8
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,639
Don't panic. Don't be afraid.

9
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:23,110
Treat the pins as obstacles
between you and Ah Si.

10
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:27,381
And then swing the ball out confidently.

11
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,383
Beat those obstacles.

12
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,740
It's all right, let me help you.

13
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,375
Okay.

14
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:22,202
You saw that. The obstacles are gone.

15
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:23,370
Ah Si belongs to you.

16
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:27,708
Yesha, you can't sacrifice yourself
just because you pity me.

17
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,644
The person Daoming Si likes now is you.

18
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:32,546
It's not a sacrifice.

19
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:33,847
I'm not into him.

20
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:36,349
You're lying.

21
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,753
Why would I lie to you?

22
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:43,690
Think about it. If someone loses
his memory because of you,

23
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:45,826
then he feels lonely and helpless,

24
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,461
and tells you that he likes you,

25
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:49,730
what would you do?

26
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,266
In order to make up for my mistake,

27
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,836
I can only try to like him.

28
00:03:57,537 --> 00:04:00,107
"I know you're on your way home.

29
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:01,641
I'll be waiting for you...

30
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,376
forever."

31
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,213
This is what you promised Ah Si.

32
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:07,814
Have you forgotten?

33
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,551
I decided to stay by his side

34
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,954
because of the words you left him.

35
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,222
For I thought,

36
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,424
as soon as I find the person
who left those words,

37
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,993
I will be able to give Ah Si back
the mess he made

38
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,796
and fulfill my dream of traveling
around the world.

39
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,101
Now that I've finally found you,

40
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:30,237
I've finally regained my freedom.

41
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:34,541
I feel really happy
for you and for myself.

42
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:43,517
Yesha.

43
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:50,123
Can you picture
Ah Si's nasal hair growing on his head?

44
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,868
Thank you, Yesha.

45
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,337
Don't thank me.

46
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:05,839
He was yours.

47
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,674
And I hit him with my car.

48
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,243
I caused you all this pain.

49
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,980
I should tell you I'm sorry.

50
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,183
Don't say that.

51
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:19,586
Right, I should wish you well.

52
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,755
Can you wish me well, too?

53
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:25,158
Tomorrow morning, I can fulfill my dream
of traveling around the world.

54
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,897
Wish me well, Shancai.

55
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,467
Not only will I wish you well,

56
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,170
I will also miss you, Yesha.

57
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,074
I will miss you, too.

58
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:05,799
We're about to part ways.

59
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:09,436
Yeah.

60
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:19,813
Keep going, Shancai.

61
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,179
Look, the stars are out.

62
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:07,193
Yesha.

63
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:09,796
Keep going.

64
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:20,941
Let's make a promise.

65
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,209
Let's not cry.

66
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,915
You go that way, I go this way.

67
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:32,218
Let's not look at each other's back.

68
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,954
Don't be sad.

69
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,289
Let's be happy for each other.

70
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:40,727
Okay?

71
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,634
That's a promise.

72
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:51,237
I'll count to three,
and we'll turn around.

73
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:54,908
One,

74
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:57,444
two,

75
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,181
three.

76
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:37,817
Yesha.

77
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,087
Yesha!

78
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,325
Yesha!

79
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,063
Yesha!

80
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,519
Look at you, you broke your promise.

81
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,223
You also said we shouldn't cry.

82
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,194
How would I know this would happen?

83
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,536
Stop crying.

84
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,139
You're crying, too.

85
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,186
ORANGE
BREAKFAST RESTAURANT

86
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,487
Welcome.

87
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:52,525
Ah Xing, you weren't such a good friend
yesterday. You left me all alone.

88
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,894
Well, there was a bit of an accident.

89
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,496
-An accident?
-Yeah.

90
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:57,530
What happened?

91
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,065
Tuna sandwich for table A.

92
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:01,334
-Milk tea for table B.
-Okay, I got the milk tea.

93
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,281
Welcome!

94
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,850
-Welcome!
-Welcome...

95
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:19,352
Table for one, sir?

96
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:20,787
Please come inside.

97
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:22,822
Sir.

98
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:24,524
Sir.

99
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,427
Sir, what do you want?

100
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:28,862
What do you want?

101
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,631
Hey, sir.

102
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:32,966
What are you trying to do?

103
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,877
Since you don't want to go back
to the past,

104
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,147
I'll join you in your present life.

105
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,122
You don't have to do this.

106
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:58,858
But I'm going to.

107
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,535
Welcome.

108
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:09,769
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

109
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,405
-Sir...
-Please have a seat.

110
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:14,908
-Table for one?
-Yes.

111
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,176
Please wait a moment.

112
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,411
Excuse me.

113
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:20,380
Sir, what would you like?

114
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,617
An orange juice and a tuna sandwich.

115
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:25,985
No problem.

116
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,021
Orange juice and tuna sandwich.

117
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,132
-Excuse me, mister.
-Yes?

118
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,767
-Napkin, please.
-Coming.

119
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,435
-Napkin, right?
-Yes, thank you.

120
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,143
-Boss.
-Yeah?

121
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:51,311
What's going on now?

122
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,445
Who knows?

123
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,384
I know.

124
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:00,687
Ah Xing wants to make amends
for his mistakes.

125
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,822
So he found a stand-in for today, right?

126
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,759
Then this Ah Xing surely is somebody.

127
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:09,862
The stand-in he found
even came with a black luxury car.

128
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,698
Yeah.

129
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,567
And he's so handsome.

130
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,104
Hey, I'm getting jealous.

131
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,875
Are the orange juice
and tuna sandwich ready?

132
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,011
Yes, a moment, please. They're coming.

133
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,679
Sir, they're almost ready.
Just a few minutes.

134
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:55,074
Hey!

135
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:55,975
Hey!

136
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:58,444
Cool!

137
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,557
-All right.
-All right, let's do this.

138
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:25,805
Hey!

139
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,479
I'm the top scorer.

140
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,783
Call me MVP.

141
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,887
MVP, my foot.

142
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:43,923
So, how's your makeup retouch?

143
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,359
-Leaving already?
-I'll give you a massage.

144
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,961
You played well, handsome.

145
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:56,569
Looks like the title of the Tough Guy Cup
will be ours next month.

146
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:57,970
But...

147
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:04,010
the chemistry between us
would probably be too late

148
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,746
to develop.

149
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,884
No problem, I got this.

150
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,723
The celebration party
after the game is also on me.

151
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,392
The celebration party is also on you?

152
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:21,561
Hey, Ah Xing,

153
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,529
your friend is dope.

154
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,164
Ah Xing?

155
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,869
Ah Xing?

156
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,041
Looks like you're living a free
and comfortable life now.

157
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:42,982
Did we use to...

158
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:46,352
I mean when we were F4,

159
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,322
did we use to hang out like this?

160
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,092
We didn't use to come outdoors

161
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,862
because you didn't like sweating.

162
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,431
But it's much more fun this way.

163
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,301
You know,

164
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:04,804
I thought Ximen was exaggerating.

165
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,740
But now I've finally understood.

166
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,778
You're living a good life now.

167
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,379
It's different from the past.

168
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,783
But I wonder, Ah Si,

169
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:18,518
how did you get to this?

170
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:22,255
I learned

171
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,826
that you can do anything
as long as you're willing to learn.

172
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,463
This you don't know about, handsome.

173
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:32,498
The best thing about our Ah Xing

174
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,835
is that he's always willing to learn.

175
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,070
Don't you know?

176
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,206
The first day he came to our restaurant,

177
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,241
he drove our boss crazy!

178
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:43,943
He totally pissed him off.

179
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,011
How?

180
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:48,347
How the hell can someone apply
for a breakfast restaurant job

181
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,917
and not know how to make over-easy eggs?

182
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,018
Yeah.

183
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,086
And the next day,

184
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,022
he brought a hot girl to make a scene.

185
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:56,989
Yeah.

186
00:15:57,857 --> 00:15:59,525
At least I know how to do it now.

187
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,030
After wasting God knows how many eggs.
What a guy!

188
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,331
Yeah, so wasteful.

189
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,570
Perhaps it seems incredible for you.

190
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,972
But for him,

191
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:16,108
that really is some achievement.

192
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,812
Because his real name is Daoming Si.

193
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,483
-Daoming Si?
-Daoming Si?

194
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,254
No wonder you changed your name

195
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:29,989
Daoming Si's such a bad name.

196
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:30,990
Yeah.

197
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,091
Is it?

198
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,660
I actually envy you guys.

199
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,097
I've known Ah Si for more than 20 years.

200
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,467
I've never seen him make
any over-easy eggs.

201
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:43,936
Of course, he has only learned how
a couple of days ago.

202
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,844
I can make you one next time if you want.

203
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,016
The game is on!

204
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,452
-Still?
-Come now.

205
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,053
Can we be a team, handsome?

206
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,121
Hey.

207
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,589
It's my turn.

208
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:06,392
Team with me or resign, pick one.

209
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:08,861
Resign!

210
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,596
I'll team with him.

211
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,301
<i>Don't be skeptics.</i>

212
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,638
Many office workers depend on the three
major festival bonuses each year.

213
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,173
So don't underestimate the number of sales
this Mid-Autumn Festival.

214
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,509
Good boy, what you're really doing
is reminding the manager

215
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,845
that he shouldn't forget
about our Mid-Autumn bonuses, isn't it?

216
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:30,216
Reminded by the two of you,

217
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,451
I guess I really can't forget about that.

218
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,620
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you, sir.

219
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:38,157
I think it's a good idea
to stimulate the customers' desire

220
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,725
to purchase through Mid-Autumn Festival.

221
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,762
However, I find the appeal
not yet precise enough.

222
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:47,733
After all, it's not as easy
to connect our products to festival gifts.

223
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,170
That's all right.
You guys can brainstorm a bit more.

224
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,075
-Greetings, President.
-Sit.

225
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:58,110
I just got off the plane.
I came by to check on you guys.

226
00:17:58,177 --> 00:17:59,378
I appreciate everyone's hard work.

227
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:01,814
Everyone, please sit down.

228
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,487
Ximen was just hosting
a creativity conference.

229
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:10,957
It is said that the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree.

230
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:12,658
President,

231
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:15,061
Ximen has just taken up his job,
and he's all in.

232
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:17,863
For the marketing plan this season,

233
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,700
he has studied three proposals thoroughly,

234
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,068
but was still unsatisfied.

235
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,471
He works overtime every day
and is very hardworking.

236
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:26,539
Really?

237
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,010
I hope your time and effort
are not being wasted.

238
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,581
Everyone seated here has more
experience than their predecessors.

239
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:38,684
I have faith in you.

240
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,289
Don't spoil him
by submitting to his temper.

241
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:47,093
I won't hold you up any longer.

242
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:50,930
-Thank you, President. Take care.
-Thank you, President. Take care.

243
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,311
Excuse me, where did we leave off?

244
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:11,984
Sir, you were looking for me?

245
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:14,020
Come here. Have a seat.

246
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:17,289
I read through your plan.

247
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,959
I know how much effort you've put into it.

248
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,896
But sometimes the effort

249
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:25,798
doesn't pay off immediately.

250
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:27,733
After all...

251
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:30,836
Sir, just say whatever's on your mind.

252
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,972
I'm saying, I'm afraid...

253
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,441
that it is unlikely
to implement this project.

254
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:40,079
Why is it so?

255
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:43,516
Because you're inexperienced.

256
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:45,251
President.

257
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:47,787
I've seen your project.

258
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,322
You simply have eyes
bigger than your stomach.

259
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,357
I do?

260
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,959
So I have eyes bigger than my stomach.

261
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:55,928
I thought you were prejudiced.

262
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,265
Actually, the idea
of this project is quite outstanding.

263
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,168
But Ximen is still new
in this business after all.

264
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,636
There will be some flaws.

265
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:04,904
No need to defend him.

266
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,774
Marketing cannot solely
rely on creativity.

267
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,878
You should learn from those
who have practical experiences.

268
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,550
Don't expect others to follow your order
because of your manager job title.

269
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,120
Your subordinates
are all more capable than you are.

270
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:24,190
If not for me, your father,

271
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,827
do you actually think that you have
what it takes to be a manager?

272
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:32,398
Stop wasting others' time

273
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:33,866
by fooling around with you.

274
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:37,770
Come to my office for a second.

275
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:38,904
We need to talk.

276
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:39,839
Yes.

277
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,044
Then why did you put me in this position?

278
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,214
If it's because your mistress

279
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,549
can't bear more capable sons for you,

280
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,786
then I suggest that you stop
doing that to yourself.

281
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:55,054
Stop this silly talk.

282
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:58,057
If you're really capable,

283
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,326
you'll produce a decent plan

284
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:03,996
to prove your father wrong.

285
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:06,665
Give me two more days.

286
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,269
If I can't handle this project,
I'll resign myself.

287
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:11,971
XIMEN CORPORATION
2002 BUSINESS PLAN

288
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,146
Sir, your black coffee.

289
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,348
Thank you.

290
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,750
Sir, I heard about the project.

291
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,018
I...

292
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:29,188
I just wanted to say that...

293
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:31,423
Please don't give up.

294
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,292
Let's work harder.

295
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:35,027
Plus, I can work overtime any day.

296
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:36,962
I...

297
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:38,931
Why are you so nervous?

298
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:40,232
Actually...

299
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,301
Actually, I'd very much like to thank you.

300
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:43,836
Thank you for giving me this promotion.

301
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:45,237
If not for you,

302
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,907
I'd never reach this position
no matter how hard I work.

303
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:51,443
I've always thought that second-generation
entrepreneurs like you

304
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,146
are all some unmotivated, lazy guys.

305
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,849
But working with you these days,

306
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:59,351
I've seen the effort you put in
and your hard work.

307
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,887
I felt more and more honored
to be able to work with you.

308
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:03,389
So...

309
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,391
So, please, don't give up easily.

310
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:06,926
I support you, and I recognize you.

311
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,627
Though my support
and recognition mean little,

312
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,763
I...

313
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,665
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

314
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:15,000
No, I mean...

315
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:20,606
Your support and recognition
mean very much to me right now.

316
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,609
But I'd like to ask you
to do one more thing that means even more.

317
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,077
No problem, what is it?

318
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:28,547
Call home first and say
you're working overtime tonight.

319
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:31,550
Then bring out all the marketing plans
from the past five years.

320
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:33,586
No problem, we'll bring it on tonight!

321
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,495
Right, I'll go prepare for it.

322
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:20,733
Coming!

323
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:37,082
Noble sir.

324
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:39,652
Who might you be looking for?

325
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:42,855
Is Mr. Dong in?

326
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,992
Mr. Dong is not home.
He's working overtime.

327
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:50,663
I am Mr. Dong's wife, Mrs. Dong.

328
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,131
And you are?

329
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,634
I am the sales executive
from your husband's company.

330
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,937
-Executive?
-Yes.

331
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:00,673
That's a very high position.
How honored to have you here.

332
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:03,342
You're such a kind supervisor

333
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:06,178
who loves and cares for his subordinates.

334
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,580
You've even come home to visit us.

335
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,282
Thank you so much for doing this.

336
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:11,917
Please, come inside.

337
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:16,255
Come. Please come inside.

338
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:22,194
Well, Mrs. Dong, I wouldn't have come

339
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:23,829
if it wasn't for something serious.

340
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:27,199
That's right, sir.
Just say whatever you need to say.

341
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:30,169
I will pass on every sentence
to my husband

342
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:33,072
as soon as he comes back from work.

343
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,341
I'll also keep nagging him
and keep an eye on him,

344
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:38,877
so he will remember
your instructions well.

345
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,780
-Actually, there's only one thing.
-Yes.

346
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:45,084
Your husband stole a company car.

347
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:50,155
-Stole a car?
-Yes.

348
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,159
You must be kidding, sir.

349
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:57,463
How it that possible? You're kidding.

350
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,131
I'm quite sure, Mrs. Dong.

351
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,534
Your husband is the only person
who keeps the keys to the showroom.

352
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,136
Besides, the evidence of him

353
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:07,006
committing the crime
has been clearly recorded on tape.

354
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:09,475
That's not possible!

355
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,711
Even though my husband didn't have
much progress throughout his life,

356
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:16,181
he would never do anything
that would bring shame to our family.

357
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,317
Especially anything illegal.

358
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:20,586
He just doesn't have the guts!

359
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:23,088
You must've made a mistake, sir.

360
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:26,025
You can't wrong an innocent person
like this.

361
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:27,693
You can't do this!

362
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,095
My husband would never
do something like that!

363
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:31,363
Anyway, Mrs. Dong,

364
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:35,968
please tell your husband to return
the company car as soon as possible.

365
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:38,137
Or else, the company will call the police.

366
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:40,939
That's it. Goodbye.

367
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:42,941
Call the police?

368
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:45,677
Sir!

369
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:49,748
My husband would never do
that kind of thing!

370
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,224
Hello?

371
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,594
Honey, where are you now?

372
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,899
Meet you at the Warner Village?

373
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:11,670
Honey, there's something
I need to ask you.

374
00:26:12,438 --> 00:26:13,305
Honey!

375
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:14,973
Honey...

376
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:17,743
What's going on?

377
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:22,548
WARNER VILLAGE

378
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:29,254
Strange.

379
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:54,379
Honey!

380
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:56,081
Honey!

381
00:26:58,117 --> 00:26:59,118
It's me.

382
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:00,552
Get in the car!

383
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:03,155
I can't park here.

384
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:04,923
Hurry up!

385
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:09,561
Get in the car, hurry.

386
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:11,997
Hurry up!

387
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:14,099
Come, get in.

388
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:17,936
Look, isn't this a cool car?

389
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:19,338
How hot is it?

390
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,140
Buckle up.

391
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,441
Here we go!

392
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:26,078
I'll take you on a trip.

393
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:32,985
Wow.

394
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:35,154
A good car is a good car.

395
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:37,823
It's very smooth, isn't it?

396
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:41,560
When you sit in a luxury car like this,

397
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:44,596
you feel superior.

398
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,964
Don't you think so, honey?

399
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:50,802
Comfortable? Feels good, right?

400
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,610
-Honey.
-Yes?

401
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:01,947
Where did you get this car?

402
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:08,654
Honey.

403
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:14,326
I remember when I proposed to you,

404
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:16,461
I told you

405
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:20,199
that I'd make you a glamorous Mrs. Dong.

406
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,669
But after marrying me,

407
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,772
I only let you bear hardships with me.

408
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:29,474
You've never known
what a good life is like.

409
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,011
Not to mention being glamorous.

410
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:36,081
So, tonight,

411
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,619
I must let you enjoy
the most luxurious car.

412
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:45,958
Let me drive you around
and take you for a joyride.

413
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:50,929
I've been thinking.

414
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:55,100
Even though I'm incompetent,

415
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,971
at least I'll make you
feel glamorous for today.

416
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,574
It's been so many years.

417
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,845
Today, my wish has finally been granted.

418
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:14,086
Honey, happy birthday.

419
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:40,345
Honey,

420
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,582
thank you.

421
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:01,700
Honey,

422
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,469
are you happy today?

423
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:07,306
Yes.

424
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,315
I feel so happy today.

425
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:25,023
Honey,

426
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:29,861
I actually never cared

427
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:32,364
about what kind of life we live.

428
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,233
It also never mattered to me

429
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,703
whether you've let us live
a good life or not.

430
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,906
Because I know you work very hard.

431
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:42,908
Therefore,

432
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:46,411
every day with you

433
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,149
is a happy day for me.

434
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,521
Honey.

435
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:04,396
I hope you'll always be this happy.

436
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,720
Honey, let's park the car here.

437
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,388
The alley to our house is so narrow.

438
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:07,225
If we are not careful, we might damage
the car. How will we compensate for that?

439
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,126
Right.

440
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:10,195
Return the car soon.

441
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,129
-I will.
-Honey.

442
00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:13,098
I'm going to return it.

443
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:14,866
I'm just driving you home first.

444
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:18,737
So that we can have
a perfect ending for tonight,

445
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:21,406
and also bring you the best memories.

446
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,441
Yeah?

447
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:23,575
Thank you, honey.

448
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:27,646
Honey, wait.

449
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:30,115
Wait a moment.

450
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,024
Honey, go ahead.

451
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:45,797
Is this the car?

452
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:48,733
Sir.

453
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:52,103
Sir, let me explain.

454
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:55,106
-I wanted to boost the car sales.
-Yes.

455
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:58,310
So I drove the car out today
to test its performance.

456
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:01,413
I have now understood
and studied its every feature.

457
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,782
I am about to drive it back
to the company.

458
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:04,983
Yes.

459
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,251
-The car key.
-What?

460
00:33:11,857 --> 00:33:14,059
-Please come with us.
-Come with you?

461
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,861
You want to test drive?
Sure, I'll take you there.

462
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:17,596
-This car's got great performance.
-Yes, great.

463
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,664
Stop playing innocent.
Come with us to the police station.

464
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:20,732
Come.

465
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:23,768
Is it that serious?
It's not necessary, is it, sir?

466
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,438
Sir, please forgive my husband.

467
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,573
This is his first time stealing a car.

468
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:32,110
Don't talk nonsense! Who's stealing?

469
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,712
Am I the type of person who steals a car?

470
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:35,580
I was only borrowing it.

471
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:38,216
Yes. This is the first time
he has borrowed a car.

472
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:39,618
Dong.

473
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:43,088
This car belongs to the company.
Do you just borrow it whenever you wish?

474
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,090
The company doesn't approve
of your behavior.

475
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:46,625
I'm also jointly liable.

476
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:49,928
Officers, excuse me.

477
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:53,064
-No. Don't.
-Let's go.

478
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:55,400
Officers, you've got it wrong.

479
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:56,635
Ma'am, please do not interfere.

480
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,503
-You've got it wrong.
-We have a lot of work to do.

481
00:33:58,570 --> 00:33:59,404
Seriously, please?

482
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:02,507
-This is a mistake. Let him go!
-You're interfering with public duty.

483
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:04,576
What are you guys doing?
What's going on, Mom?

484
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:07,045
-Shancai.
-Mr. Dong...

485
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,650
Wait a minute. What did my father do?
Why are you taking him?

486
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:15,353
Shancai, tell them that your dad
would never steal a car.

487
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,721
-He would never...
-Steal a car?

488
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:18,723
Shancai, believe me.

489
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,326
I didn't steal it.
I was just borrowing it.

490
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,896
You said my father stole the car.
Do you have any evidence?

491
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:27,599
Miss, your father stole a company car.

492
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:29,467
Now he's here with the car.

493
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:32,704
That's impossible.
There must be some misunderstanding.

494
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:34,272
Excuse me.

495
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,308
Lei.

496
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,743
Mr. Dong,

497
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,613
is this the car I ordered from you?

498
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,416
Lei, when did you...

499
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,351
Master Huaze.

500
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,353
You said this was the car you ordered?

501
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,287
Yeah.

502
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,357
Dong, what the hell?

503
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:55,026
I... Yes.

504
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:58,530
Because I urgently need the car tonight,

505
00:34:59,064 --> 00:35:01,433
I asked Mr. Dong to drive it here for me.

506
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:05,103
Honey...

507
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,710
I was supposed to pick up the car here.
Wasn't I, Mr. Dong?

508
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,279
Yes.

509
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:19,451
Lei.

510
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:26,057
Lei, thank you.

511
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:33,531
Do we need to be so polite to each other?

512
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:02,527
Why do you always show up
when I'm most vulnerable?

513
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:12,504
Shancai.

514
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:15,940
Have you ever thought about it?

515
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,680
If Ah Si never regains his memory,

516
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,585
what change will it make to the world?

517
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,800
The Earth will still be turning.

518
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:45,904
The sun will still rise every day.

519
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,143
The stars will still be out
in the night sky.

520
00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:56,481
You will still work hard to live.

521
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:00,785
I will still sleep for 12 hours a day.

522
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:04,355
Nothing will change.

523
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,861
Yeah.

524
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:11,896
Nothing will change.

525
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,166
The only thing that changed...

526
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:18,203
was Daoming Si left me.

527
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,309
Don't worry about it.

528
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,345
Ah Si has lost his memory for now.

529
00:37:29,214 --> 00:37:31,549
Who knows if he will
remember everything someday?

530
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:51,736
Shancai.

531
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:56,441
A lot of tomorrows are waiting for you
in this world.

532
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:05,617
Good thing that you're back.

533
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,499
TAKE CARE

534
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:17,055
<i>Didn't you say that stars
would provide direction?</i>

535
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:19,057
There are no stars in Taipei.

536
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:20,758
No stars?

537
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:23,194
It's true.

538
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:24,762
I don't see Brave Yesha, too.

539
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,364
Daoming Si.

540
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:36,067
Where's Yesha?

541
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:37,535
I have no idea.

542
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:39,270
I've waited for so long
but I haven't seen her.

543
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:41,773
Why are you at the airport?

544
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:45,510
Did she tell you
that she was going to Barcelona?

545
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,246
She said she was going to travel
around the world.

546
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:49,847
She...

547
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:53,785
What sort of things did you say to her?

548
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,221
Why did you force her to leave?

549
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:01,759
How can you be so selfish?

550
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:09,434
I will never forgive you.

551
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:25,249
I was just wondering

552
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,719
if I could wake you up by slapping you.

553
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,728
Daoming Si!

554
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:06,090
DAOMING SI

555
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:09,060
I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU

556
00:44:03,608 --> 00:44:05,676
She must be in Barcelona by now.

557
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:14,352
Maybe she's at a château already.

558
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:20,024
Unfortunately, you haven't been
to any châteaux there.

559
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:27,765
Sha's dishes are different
from what you would expect.

560
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,039
And the sunset over there
is different from here, too.

561
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,775
