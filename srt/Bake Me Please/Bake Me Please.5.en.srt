Then why did they come to work here?

370
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,006
Let me tell you something, Ai Shin.

371
00:40:13,006 --> 00:40:15,906
Stop acting like you're the center of the universe.

373
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,040
P'Shin, Phi!

374
00:40:35,026 --> 00:40:37,180
Are you going to mock me?

375
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,820
I'm only worried about you.

- Let go.

Ai Shin, what the hell did you do?

381
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,400
I'm fine, Phi.

382
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,740
Fine?

383
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,220
He did that to you, and you say it's fine?

394

I don't want to feel like this anymore, Phi.

396
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,180

403

wants to take care of you,

404
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,500

What is it?

407
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:34,880
- I have nothing to say to you.
- I also don't want to talk to you.

408
00:44:36,186 --> 00:44:38,946
But I need to tell you something important.

Does Peach know...

415
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:12,418
that you texted me about Chef Yod?

416
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,560
You did that because you wanted to beat me, didn't you?

417
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,120
So you want to take everything from me,

418

427

so you know what I've been through.

428
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,660
- Is it my fault?
- Yes!

It's all your fault!

430
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,360
