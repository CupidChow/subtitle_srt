00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,020
This texture is like what I tasted before.

182
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,020
Really?

183
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,020
When?

184
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:37,666
Ai Shin brought one for me in college.

185
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:43,270
He said "this" inspired him to become a pastry chef.

186
00:13:45,518 --> 00:13:48,160
Oh… That straight face young man?

187
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,950
He always smiles whenever he eats my cakes.

188
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,820
He hasn't visited here for some time.

189
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,180
Can you take some cakes to give him?

190
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,320
Yes.

191
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,620
That's why Ai Shin and Peach are…

192
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,210
P'Ohb? Atom?

193
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,200
What are you doing here?

194
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,720
Yes, I can do it.

195
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
That's great, dude!

196
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,280
Awesome.

197
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,440
Why don't you ask a reason for Shin's absence?

198
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:56,720
Whatever he does or wherever he goes, he must have his reason.

199
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,040
Making cakes is everything in his life.

200
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,700
I promise to do my best in this job.

201
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,700
I love you, dude.

202
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,866
Stop, stop. Enough.

203
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,080
I'm thankful to you, Peach.

204
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,426
I really am.

205
00:15:16,426 --> 00:15:18,620
It'll be only a few days.

206
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,440
Shin will be back soon.

207
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,260
Sure.

208
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,260
Thanks again.

209
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,960
It's all right, Phi.

210
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,153
Don't mention it.

211
00:15:36,766 --> 00:15:39,126
I'll go from here.

212
00:15:39,126 --> 00:15:41,900
Yes, Phi. See you later.

213
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,280
- See you.
- Yes, see you.

214
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,580
Let's go home.

215
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,240
Now what?

216
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,160
How can I make an excuse for a three-day absence?

217
00:16:09,507 --> 00:16:13,500
P'Guy. I must go to Chiang Mai for an urgent errand.

218
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,380
May I take a three-day leave?

219
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,080
Chiang Mai is too far.

220
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,160
Three days won't be enough.

221
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,400
P'Guy.

222
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:30,105
My grandmother is sick and was admitted to the hospital.

223
00:16:30,105 --> 00:16:33,385
May I take a three-day leave?

224
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,720
I should be the one who's sick!

225
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,540
P'Guy, may I take a three-day leave?

226
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,220
I have the flu.

227
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,680
That should do.

228
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,100
Grandma!

229
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,100
I'm here to see Peach!

230
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,720
I'm coming!

231
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,420
Grandma.

232
00:17:21,693 --> 00:17:23,320
- What is it?
- Good evening.

233
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,180
How is he? Has he gone to the doctor?

234
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,280
- The doctor?
- Yes, he has a high fever.

235
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,820
Peach has a fever?

236
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,120
Yes, he does.

237
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,060
Has he done an ATK test?
(ATK = Antigen Test Kit)

238
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,420
I brought one with me.

239
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,960
Where is he? >I'll check on him for you. Is he in his room?

240
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,980
No, no. I asked him to go buy flour.

241
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,240
He'll be back soon.

242
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,040
There he is. He's coming.

243
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,300
I'm ho…

244
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,400
Why did you lie to me?

245
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,664
I'm sorry for lying to you, Phi.

246
00:18:11,664 --> 00:18:16,460
As I told you, I must help Ohb.

247
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,220
Help Ohb?

248
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,800
Is it Ohb or Shin?

249
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,300
Him… too.

250
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,140
Did Ohb tell you the reason?

251
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,600
He said P'Shin has an important thing to do.

252
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,800
And I believe it's really important.

253
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,560
Really?

254
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,500
Does this mean Shin is still dear to you?

255
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,960
Fine.

256
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,960
You can go.

257
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,440
Go and work for Temptation.

258
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,820
Are you sure?

259
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,500
I'm serious.

260
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,400
If you work there,

261
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,120
don't come to Sweetheart again.

262
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,420
Here I am.

263
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,465
Come. Torta caprese. Start!

264
00:20:11,465 --> 00:20:13,280
- Let's do it.
- Come.

265
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,320
Very fragrant.

266
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,780
What's left is the winning toddy palm cake.

267
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,660
I have the recipe.

268
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,120
Okay, let's try.

269
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,840
I'll do my best.

270
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,040
Done.

271
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,520
I'll taste it.

272
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,400
The mellowness is the same.

273
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:55,860
But it's not as fluffy and doesn't melt in your mouth.

274
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,420
I followed the recipe as best as I could.

275
00:22:23,517 --> 00:22:26,600
I've never seen Chin make it.

276
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:32,920
So I missed many crucial details that match his skill level.

277
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,220
I understand.

278
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,220
What do we do?

279
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,286
It's almost time to open the café.

280
00:22:47,086 --> 00:22:50,820
Maybe I should upload a video,

281
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,800
announcing free torta caprese as an apology,

282
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,880
and temporarily close the place.

283
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,120
- What?
- What?

284
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,340
P'Ohb.

285
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:06,300
Can you give me one more chance?

286
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,180
Despite the problem I had with P'Shin,

287
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:15,000
I'll go to see P'Shin and ask him to teach me.

288
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,040
Cake is everything for P'Shin.

289
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,740
And I believe

290
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:24,260
P'Shin won't let this kind of issue happen if he's here.

291
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,620
Thanks, Peach.

292
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:32,000
But putting a band-aid on a problem doesn't work.

293
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,100
I'm the owner.

294
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,920
I must solve it as a professional.

295
00:23:42,274 --> 00:23:43,774
Phi.

296
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:05,540
First of all, I must apologize to you all from the bottom of my heart

297
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,260
for the mistakes we've made in Temptation.

298
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:15,060
As the owner, I have no excuse to make.

299
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,480
And I will temporarily close the bakery.

300
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,460
No! You can't do that, my friend!

301
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,280
What do you mean?

302
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,540
I mean…

303
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,980
we three started this bakery.

304
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:43,620
There were me, you, and Chin.

305
00:24:44,806 --> 00:24:47,299
Will you close the place on your own?

306
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,120
But you…

307
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,880
Yes. I know it was my fault,

308
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,480
and I quit.

309
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,860
But I quit because of my ego.

310
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,860
And my ego…

311
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,860
doesn't exceed this place.

312
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,700
Doesn't exceed our endeavor.

313
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,220
You always… surprise me.

314
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,420
What do I do now?

315
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,360
Start a live broadcast to check feedback.

316
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,680
Apologize to the customers.

317
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,080
I'll take care of the rest.

318
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,080
I must apologize to you all

319
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,340
and accept all blame as the owner.

320
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,220
I'm also to blame.

321
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:50,140
Ohb, Shin and I started Temptation.

322
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,700
I appreciate everyone who has been supporting us,

323
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,200
but we don't provide good enough services.

324
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,680
We three are deeply sorry.

325
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,080
Shin also feels guilty about this.

326
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,740
This is a clip from Shin.

327
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:16,400
I'm the one to blame the most for this problem

328
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,700
because… I never listened to anyone,

329
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,586
never trusted in others' abilities,

330
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:32,700
and never accepted help from anyone,

331
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:40,460
even though I'm not strong enough to bear everything alone.

332
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,090
But someone taught me

333
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:53,260
>to have compassion.

334
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,780
And share what's on my mind with others.

335
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:02,840
Cake making is my whole life.

336
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:08,200
I won't back down no matter what.

337
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,780
To show our sincerity.

338
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,940
Here.

339
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,320
This is the winning toddy palm cake.

340
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,080
And to apologize to all customers,

341
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,260
we'll let you all taste the cake for free as an apology.

342
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,300
I and Shin worked on it the whole night.

343
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,000
Please accept our sincerity and give us a chance.

344
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,180
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

345
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,940
- Here it is.
- All gone.

346
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,960
- That was the last piece.
- Is it all gone?

347
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,780
Okay. Here's the last box.

348
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,860
We've made it!

349
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,040
P'Guy, what happened?

350
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,080
P'Shin is sick?

351
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,560
Peach, come with me.

352
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:29,420
But someone taught me to have compassion

353
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:34,020
and share what's on my mind with others.

354
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,260
Cake making is my whole life.

355
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:43,660
I won't back down no matter what.

356
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,800
This is the winning toddy palm cake.

357
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:52,000
And we'll let you all taste the cake for free as an apology.

358
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,600
Please accept our sincerity and give us a chance.

359
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,780
Why are you all alone?

360
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,760
Peach.

361
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,760
You should've been in that broadcast.

362
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:39,620
I thought maybe…

363
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,380
I wasn't supposed to be there.

364
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:47,400
Because my personality is unbearable.

365
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,000
I'm too terrible to be with others.

366
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,500
I have a sharp tongue…

367
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,360
and I'm heartless.

368
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,480
Chin.

369
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:17,886
A heartless person can't do this.

370
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,640
The apology on this paper

371
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,180
and the apology in the broadcast

372
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,660
are all gentle and sincere.

373
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,380
Do you know that?

374
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:54,866
Don't be alone while you're sick.

375
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,220

Everything that happened

385
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,800
was my doing.

386
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,220
I lied to you.

I'm not together with Peach.

388
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,920
I confessed to him,

00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,160
but he denied it.

390
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:14,740
He even said he couldn't stop loving you.

391
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,540
It's because of my selfishness.

392
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:23,730
I thought Peach could forget you one day

393
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:26,700
if I could separate you two.

394
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:33,746
Are you telling me this
because you pity me for being sick?

395
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,120
I never think like that.

You're my friend.

00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,400
You two can't separate from each other.

Look at your face now.

00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,740
You're as glum as Peach.

What have I done?

403
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:10,260
I'm so sorry for doing
such a selfish thing.

404
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,680
It's also my fault.

405
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:18,152
I'm not steadfast enough.

406
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,800
You've changed a lot.

407
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,060
Peach can really change you.

Wait.

413
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,600
I'm sorry.

414
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,320
Guy told me what really happened.

415
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,720
About sending photos
from Chef Table

416
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,660
and lying to agitate you.

417
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:59,560
He couldn't have agitated me,
because I had been steadfast enough

418
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,160
and more open when talking to you.

419
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:07,900
It's "us." We were both hot-headed

420
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,420
and didn't listen to each other.

422
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:18,660
How come a positive guy like you
becomes hot-headed?

How can you ask that?

424
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,900
It's you.

425
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:28,612
You made me jealous first.

426
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,260
I was jealous too.

427
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,860
I was being possessive.

428
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,040
You know?

429
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:48,340
The more I'm jealous, the more I love.

430
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,580

and full of positivity.

451
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,420
It's probably not love.

- Of course, grandma.

00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,352
But it's not obvious.

545
00:46:06,352 --> 00:46:12,853
♫ Even though no one
in this world understands ♫

546
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:16,840
♫ And ready to be air, formless,
and disappear ♫

547
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,000
Thank you, Peach.
♫ But I will love ♫

548
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,120
♫ But I will love, I will love ♫

549
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:24,180
For making me a better person.

550
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:29,520
♫ Give all my heart, all I have ♫

551
00:46:30,699 --> 00:46:38,539
♫ And I will love, I will love,
love you every second ♫

552
00:46:42,526 --> 00:46:44,280
You want it, huh?

553
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,520
Take that.

554
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,920
I give in.

555
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,649
♫ Ready to hug you ♫

556
00:47:06,649 --> 00:47:11,649
♫ Even though no one
in this world understands ♫

557
00:47:11,649 --> 00:47:18,869
♫ And ready to be air, formless,
and disappear ♫

558
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:27,200
♫ But I will love, I will love,
love without conditions ♫

559
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:32,295
♫ Give all my heart, all I have ♫

560
00:47:32,295 --> 00:47:35,895
♫ Do you see it? ♫

561
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:39,629
♫ Do you understand at all? ♫

562
00:47:39,629 --> 00:47:46,062
♫ Can you recognize that you have someone? ♫

563
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:50,815
♫ I'm ready to listen ♫

564
00:47:50,815 --> 00:47:54,435
♫ If you're still uncomfortable ♫

565
00:47:54,435 --> 00:48:01,275
♫ If you want to vent, I'm still here ♫

566
00:48:02,466 --> 00:48:04,435
♫ Ready to hug you ♫

567
00:48:04,435 --> 00:48:09,235
♫ Even though no one
in this world understands ♫

568
00:48:09,235 --> 00:48:16,455
♫ And ready to be air, formless,
and disappear ♫

569
00:48:16,455 --> 00:48:24,795
♫ But I will love, I will love,
love without conditions ♫

570
00:48:24,795 --> 00:48:31,295
♫ Give all my heart, all I have ♫

571
00:48:31,295 --> 00:48:39,356
♫ And I will love, I will love,
love you every second ♫

572
00:48:39,356 --> 00:48:45,888
♫ I'll help you learn what true love is like ♫

573
00:48:45,888 --> 00:48:52,208
