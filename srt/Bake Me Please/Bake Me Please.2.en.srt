that a small cake can make people happy.

298
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,420

If I had a grandmother like yours,

367
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,600
my life would have been easier.

368
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,880
I'm envious of you.

369
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:59,100
So treasure your grandmother.

370
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,900
I already do that.

371
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,559
I'll let you be her grandchild,

372
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:10,320
but the favorite grandchild is only me.

373
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,820
Okay?

374
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:26,120
What were you two talking about? You're grinning.

375
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,800
I'm grinning? No, Grandma, I'm not.

376
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,000
No, I'm not. Am I?

377
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:38,660
I don't get how hard P'Shin's childhood was.

378
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,920
Still, I'm so lucky that I have you, Grandma.

379
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:45,020
P'Shin has nobody at all.

380
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,540
You finally understand me.

381
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,740
What do you mean by that?

382
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:54,820
I told you to have sympathy for others.

383
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:59,020
When you understand and have sympathy with others,

384
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:03,920
you open your mind and see things you've never seen.

385
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:09,320
Do you mean I shouldn't judge people too quickly?

386
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,140
From what I saw,

387
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:17,700
Shin isn't really happy despite his success.

388
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,280
You're right, Grandma.

389
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,700
His mood always swings, unlike other people.

390
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:28,220
It won't be long until he'll feel better.

Are you humming?

399
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,000
I've been hearing him for a while.

442
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,400
He packed his stuff and left through the back.

- Damn it!
- Ouch!

444
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,166
Ai Peach, calm down, Dude.

445
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:44,540
Sorry.

446
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:48,360
How can I calm myself? He was so harsh on me!

447
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,620
I'd rather flee before I get kicked out.

448
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:54,240
Peach. I know what's going on.

449
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,840
Phi! P'Shin went too far this time. It's not okay.

450
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,640
I agree.

- Hey, hey.

453
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,060
- Why did you have to…
- Hey, hey. Take it easy.

00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,845
I don't want to listen to only one side of the story.

456
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,120
I made mistakes. It's…

00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,850
It was my fault.

I'm sorry.

00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:38,540

- It…
- That's odd.

00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,920
What did he say? Sorry?

463
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,620
Did P'Shin say sorry?

464
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:25,180
Excuse me, Phi, can you say "sorry" again?

00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,393
There's no one here. No need to be shy.

Wow, this house is beautiful.

I'm leaving.

549
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,180
You said you would be with me.

550
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,340
What's wrong with you?

551
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,440
Stay with me.

552
00:46:42,247 --> 00:46:44,247
You are a snorer.

Your nose is as good as my neighbor's dog.

556
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:38,880
Here. This is for you.

557
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,060
I didn't order that.

558
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:46,280
I know you like it.

559
00:48:51,299 --> 00:48:53,539
Suit yourself.

560
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,280

My arm is injured because of you.

563
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,880
You must make up for it.

564
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,760
What's going on between you and my friend?

565
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,400
Are you guys dating?

566
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,220
How is that possible?

567
00:49:58,220 --> 00:49:59,263
I don't even like him.

568
00:49:59,263 --> 00:50:00,900
Frankly, he's annoying.

569
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:05,460
I've never been able to beat Shin. I have always been second.

00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:09,580
I want to tell you guys that

this is the last day I work here.

572
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:15,080
Don't waste your time on that heartless man.

573
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:19,526
But now I'm not so sure if he's really heartless.
