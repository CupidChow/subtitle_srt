Hi, Everyone. I'm in front of "Temptation".

12
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,360
You can see that the line is long.

13

This café hasn't opened yet.

14
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,232
The café is trendy for its torta caprese,

15
00:01:22,232 --> 00:01:25,180
of which 20 pieces are sold per day.

16
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,423

May I ask you why this cake is so special?

42
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,000
Yes, this cake is a flourless cake.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,140
Instead, it's made from almonds and hazelnuts

44
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,940
that are mixed with Italian chocolate to form this soft cake.

45
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,840
It's not only this special cake,

46
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,400
but the bakery also has the best chefs.

47
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,160
Chef Shin takes care of the cakes, while Chef Guy takes care of the pies.

48
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,660
I manage the bakery and come up with new recipes.

50
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,700

My blood sugar level will probably skyrocket today.

52

Guy only sells 50 pieces of his blueberry pies in the morning

55
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,560
and another 50 in the afternoon.

56
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,920
We sell few because we're meticulous with our craft.

57
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,900
The blueberry pie is so tasty.

58
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,540
I still wonder why you only sell 20 torta caprese per day.

59
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,360
- That's because the chef is an introvert.
- Don't say that.

60
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,641
That's because the chef is meticulous with every step,

61
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:19,080
so it's a rare item.

62
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,980

71
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,958
Right. I joined right away

72
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:23,261

- Help me!

191

Shin won't let anyone help him make cakes, Mom.

192

You know that he won't welcome an assistant.

193
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,960
You must make Shin want to find an assistant.

194
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,920
The cake is this popular. You can't sell only 20 pieces per day.

195
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,580
It won't be interesting if we sell too many.

196

Let the cake be a rare item.

197
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:41,780
This isn't a premium-brand bag that you can sell just a few of.

198
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,760
We sell for profit, not for awards.

199
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,600
I don't care. You must make Shin accept Atom as his assistant.

200
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,880
Why must it be me, Mom?

201
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,760
Though it can be anyone,

202

you haven't done anything tangible since you graduated.

203
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:03,460
Just help Shin bake cakes until you're skilled enough to manage the second branch.

204
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,620
You never ask if I want to do it.

205
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,720
Trust me, Atom.

206

Whatever I choose for you is the best.

207
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,840
I still wonder why you only sell 20 torta caprese per day.

208
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:30,520
That's because the chef is meticulous with every step, so it's a rare item.

209
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,520
Now, I'm curious about another chef.

of which only 20 pieces are sold per day.

213
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:46,120
It's aromatic, sweet, rich, and nutty.

214
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,400
Most importantly, it isn't dry.

215
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,520

If you don't know a thing,

356
00:27:45,825 --> 00:27:47,529
don't act smart.

357
00:27:47,529 --> 00:27:51,137
Don't bully him! Tell me off for my mistakes!

358
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:53,420
Leave my friend out of it!

359
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,460
I don't bully but tell the facts.

360
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,300
Get out if you're not ready.

361
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,760
Hey, calm down.

362
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,800
You, too. Calm yourself.

363
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,657
What are you looking at?

364
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,480
Wait, Peach.

365
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,540
- Dude, calm down.
- Peach.

366
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,980
Ai Peach!

367
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,800
Peach!

368
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,080
Hey, Peach.

369
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,420
Hey, Peach. Wait.

370
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:34,280
Peach, it's such a waste of your talents.

371
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,440
How about this? You can assist me in making pies.

372
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,180
I can teach you everything I know.

373
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,120
That sounds good.

374
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,820
It's better than selling cakes at your house.

375
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,660
That's right.

376
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,100
Thank you, but that's fine.

377
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,960
Because if I stay here any longer,

378
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,525
it will just spoil the atmosphere.

379
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,860
Why do you care?

380
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,700
Let that arrogant brat go.

381
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,420
Please excuse me.

382
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,100
Peach. Come on, wait!

383
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,000
Peach! Peach!

384
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,280
Ai Shin!

385
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:28,660
I'm sorry for wasting your time, Dude.

386
00:29:29,306 --> 00:29:30,743
You don't have to be.

387
00:29:30,743 --> 00:29:33,460
It's not your fault.

388
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:38,740
I don't know what that guy has been through,

389
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:41,800
but it wasn't right for him to do that to us.

390
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,680
Right.

391
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,420
I usually don't break the yolk.

392
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,355
I don't know what's wrong with me today.

393
00:29:48,355 --> 00:29:50,960
He pressured you.

394
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,118
What's next for you?

395
00:29:53,118 --> 00:29:55,251
I don't know.

396
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:58,940
But my mom will be mad if she knows.

397
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:04,840
Atom. Tell your mom you don't like baking.

398
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,500
I don't know if that's the case.

399
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,936
I'm a good-for-nothing anyway.

400
00:30:10,936 --> 00:30:13,451
I trained in baking to help my brother,

401
00:30:13,451 --> 00:30:16,433
but I'm still lost

402
00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:18,820
and don't know my passion.

403
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:28,674
It's all right. Don't pressure yourself that much.

404
00:30:28,674 --> 00:30:32,067
Your life isn't that tough.

405
00:30:32,067 --> 00:30:35,080
I believe you'll find your passion one day.

406
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,160
There's still a lot of time.

407
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,640
Go for it.

408
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,100
You have my support.

409
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,340
Yes.

410
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,440
Here.

411
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,640
Atom.

412
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:04,460
Son, tell me how you helped Shin.

413
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:14,037
He separated yolks and measured the ingredients.

414
00:31:14,037 --> 00:31:16,997
He hasn't done much yet. Am I right?

415
00:31:16,997 --> 00:31:20,140
Yes, Mom. Typical chores.

416
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,880
It's okay.

417
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,080
You'll learn something.

418
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,980
Try observing how Shin beats eggs and uses ingredients.

419
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:34,160
Every step.

420
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,700
Do anything to learn all the techniques.

421
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,408
- Understand?
- Yes, Mom.

422
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:46,660
I'll go to the bakery to cheer for you when I'm free.

423
00:31:47,878 --> 00:31:50,680
- Yes, Mom.
- Okay, Mom.

424
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,160
That was close.

425
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,060
What should I do, Phi?

426
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:08,100
He's handsome. But why is he so rude?

427
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,943
That will stop your complaint.

428
00:32:10,943 --> 00:32:14,034
You've been complaining about him the whole day.

429
00:32:14,034 --> 00:32:16,780
What's with the chef?

430
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,540
There is no point in complaining.

431
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,830
He can't hear what you say.

432
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:24,926
He upsets me, Grandma.

433
00:32:24,926 --> 00:32:27,340
Don't forget to wake up early

434
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:31,140
and make cakes for the regular customer.

435
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:36,740
Is it the one who buys many cakes and gives them to orphans?

436
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,640
Yes.

437
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,580
So kind-hearted.

438
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,580
That person buys our cakes every month.

439
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,760
I want to see him, or her, once.

440
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,760
You make the deliveries. Haven't you seen them yet?

441
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,480
Not at all.

442
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,180
Teacher Um always says the person is busy.

[Nokkrajib House Orphanage Foundation]

444
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,240
[Nokkrajib House]

445
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:16,080
Here come nice chiffon cakes.

446
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:19,080
You're all in the line.

447
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,020
Come and pick one.

448
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,500
Enjoy the cakes.

449
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,300
Thank you.

450
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:36,643
Enjoy.

451
00:33:36,643 --> 00:33:39,086
This is the payment.

452
00:33:39,086 --> 00:33:40,660
Thank you.

453
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,583
My customer is strange.

454
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:47,560
The person doesn't transfer money to me but gives you cash to pay me.

455
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,660
Do you want to see him?

456
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,940
- Is he here today?
- Yes.

457
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:55,820
Maybe he's by the pool.

458
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,268
I see.

459
00:33:57,268 --> 00:33:59,120
Take a cake with you.

460
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,663
He always asks me to keep one for him.

461
00:34:01,663 --> 00:34:05,306
Of course. I'll go see him.

462
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,212
Dad and Mom said they'd come to pick me up.

463
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:26,840
They said they'd come for me soon.

464
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,740
You? Why are you here?

465
00:34:48,773 --> 00:34:50,440
Really, that's bad luck.

466
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:55,620
If it's about the job, there's nothing to talk about.

467
00:34:56,466 --> 00:35:01,500
Are you not only self-absorbed, but also pessimistic?

468
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,647
I'm the one who should complain.

469
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,780
Here.

470
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,752
Is this chiffon cake yours?

471
00:35:12,752 --> 00:35:14,886
Yes, it is.

472
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:25,452
What? You don't look happy when you know it's my cake.

473
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:29,340
Well, I don't mind it.

474
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:32,440
Seriously, your face tells me otherwise.

475
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,580
Tell me what's on your mind.

476
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,305
It's nothing at all.

477
00:35:40,392 --> 00:35:44,157
Come on, Phi! Be frank with me.

478
00:35:44,157 --> 00:35:45,857
Let go!

479
00:35:45,857 --> 00:35:47,926
I don't like being touched on the shoulder.

480
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,180
Let go!

481
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,280
Here.

482
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,640
Gosh, Phi!

483
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,460
Are you giggling?

484
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,780
Do you think it's funny?

485
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:21,520
I told you not to touch my shoulder.

486
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,220
You deserved that, you know?

487
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:27,700
But now, can you pull me up?

488
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,900
Fast.

489
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,480
Fine.

490
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,760
Take my hand.

491
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,660
Here.

492
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,340
Having all the ingredients doesn't mean you can make it.

493
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,440
I don't need him. He'll be a hindrance for me.

494
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,960
Let that arrogant brat go.

495
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,593
Serves you right.

496
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,260
You pushed me into the pool.

497
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:00,280
I didn't, Brat.

498
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,260
Why did you pull me?

499
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,620
So what?

500
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,200
Come. Don't you need my help?

501
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,120
Come…

502
00:37:49,152 --> 00:37:54,480
This is because you didn't let me touch your shoulder.

503
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,980
Are you crazy? Why did you pull me?

504
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,520
You pushed me first.

505
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,120
What a jinx…

506
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,660
So are you.

507
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:23,440
Grandma, may I borrow your phone?

508
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,880
You made your phone wet yourself.

509
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,740
You weren't careful.

510
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,500
Here's Chef Shin, the one who chased me away from the bakery

511
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:41,470
and bought our cakes for the orphans.

512
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,740
He looks kind.

513
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:48,920
You can't tell how people are from their looks.

514
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:55,560
I'm not sure if he will buy cakes from us again.

515
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:01,340
Personal issues and work are separate.

516
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,700
I think he can distinguish them.

517
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,600
What about you?

518
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,080
To be honest, I can't.

519
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,900
Ai Peach!

520
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,420
Ai Peach!

521
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,780
Hey, Ai 'Tom, what wrong?

522
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,480
You're so loud.

523
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,140
I didn't want to come,

524
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,980
but I couldn't reach you.

525
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,400
I dropped my phone into the water.

526
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,900
- It's in a sack of rice now.
- What?

527
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,840
There are waterproof phones, you know?

528
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,220
Okay, okay!

529
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,520
Bad luck, right?

530
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,452
Would merit-making help?

531
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:55,820
That's a good idea.

532
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:59,340
I want to repel a jinx from my life.

533
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:08,900
Or you can count yourself lucky.

534
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:12,280
I still wonder why P'Shin changed his mind.

535
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,940
He says we can help him work tomorrow.

536
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,980
- Really?
- I mean it!

537
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,840
I don't know which god changed his mind.

538
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,380
I made vows to many of them.

539
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,740
I'm not sure if I can give offerings to them all.

540
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,557
It's so suspicious.

541
00:40:29,557 --> 00:40:32,533
This must be his prank.

542
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,100
I don't think so.

543
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,360
But if he bullies you,

544
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,576
I won't let him do it.

545
00:40:40,576 --> 00:40:44,169
Trust me and come with me. Okay?

546
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,960
I don't want to.

547
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,560
What?

548
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,580
I'd rather make cakes with my grandmother.

549
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:53,547
A café ordered my cakes.

550
00:40:53,547 --> 00:40:56,113
I'm happier this way.

551
00:40:56,642 --> 00:41:00,540
If we learn from P'Shin and start our own bakery,

552
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,680
we'll be unstoppable!

553
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,900
He's really skilled.

554
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:09,100
Even if he's a bit of a bully and a jerk.

555
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,598
Not a bit.

556
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,080
Can't I get some sleep?

557
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,073
Who's calling me?

558
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,500
Hello?

559
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,560
Hello?

560
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,260
Hello?

561
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,920
I'll hang up if you don't say anything.

562
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,460
P'Shin?

563
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,896
Do you want to go to the hospital?

564
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,240
No, I'm fine.

565
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,960
Unbelievable.

566
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,506
You tasted his cake

567
00:42:41,506 --> 00:42:45,932
because you didn't believe you could lose to someone.

568
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,920
How could I lose to that brat?

569
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,665
We always lose from time to time.

570
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:01,290
But he copies my recipe.

571
00:43:02,792 --> 00:43:05,192
What did you think after you tasted it?

572
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:13,280
How was that possible?

573
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:19,380
It reminded me of the first cake I had.

574
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,380
[Next Episode]
I think P'Shin is bullying Ai Peach again.

575
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,140
You can't even do the basics.

576
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,163
Throw it away.

577
00:43:27,163 --> 00:43:28,763
Don't be stupidly cocky again.

578
00:43:28,763 --> 00:43:31,360
I told you not to mind Shin's words.

579
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,700
I heard Peach had a quarrel with P'Shin in the kitchen.

580
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,420
How's Peach?

581
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:38,432
P'Guy is acting weird.

582
00:43:38,432 --> 00:43:39,400
It's strange.

583
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,020
It's good enough you can stand Ai Shin this far.

584
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,120
Still, I'm so lucky that I have you, Grandma.

585
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:48,040
P'Shin has nobody at all.

586
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:51,432
No one in this world deserves to be alone, Phi.

587
00:43:51,432 --> 00:43:55,980
But in my world, being alone is a bliss.

588
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:00,140
But can you share that world with me?

589
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:03,020
