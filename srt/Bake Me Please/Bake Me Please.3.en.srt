I was scared out of my wits.

This is correct.

73
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,820

It's really aromatic, Phi.

76
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:44,460
Think about it. If my grandmother's 35-baht cakes had a vanilla aroma,

77
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,300
the costs would exceed the price.

78
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:54,420
You can put these pods in the sugar jars at home.

79
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,160
They'll make the sugar more aromatic.

00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,580
Thank you. I'm thirs—

182
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,180
Open it for me.

183
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,700
What?

184
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,460
Open it for me. I want a drink.

185
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,620
It's for you.

186
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,985
He's sleeping.

187
00:18:46,346 --> 00:18:49,660
You're awake, Phi? Let's have breakfast.

188
00:18:50,793 --> 00:18:52,946
I'll take a shower first.

189
00:19:06,593 --> 00:19:10,100
But... I have only one hand.

190
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,720
See? What should I do?

191
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,800
Then don't take a shower.

192
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,637
Why are you asking?

193
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:20,080
[Temptation]
[We open Mon-Sun | 08:00–18:00 hr.]
[We open every day | We love you every day]

194
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,940
Damn. It doesn't rise.

195
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,740
You should do it again. It would probably be faster.

196
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,060
P'Shin will come soon.

197
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,140
I can't take it anymore.

198
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,940
Can you help me?

199
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,160
There he comes…

200
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,600
P'Shin...

201
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,740
What is it?

202
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,740
It's nothing, Phi.

203
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,720
- What are you hiding?
- Nothing.

204
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,573
Here.

205
00:20:59,847 --> 00:21:01,567
What is this?

206
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,680
The cream doesn't rise.

207
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,740
I made a mistake with the ingredients.

208
00:21:13,946 --> 00:21:15,846
Do it again.

209
00:21:15,846 --> 00:21:17,420
It's okay.

210
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,860
I'll do it.

211
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,000
Why didn't I get scolded?

212
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,033
Do you want to get scolded?

213
00:21:31,033 --> 00:21:32,833
Bullshit.

214
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:38,680
I think he's calmer since his arm recovered.

215
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,720
Isn't that good?

216
00:21:41,486 --> 00:21:46,066
There must be something wrong with him.

217
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,880
I heard that.

218
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,180
Come and see how I do it.

219
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,880
Yes.

220
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,320
[Dessert Master]

221
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,880
Here comes the first challenge, "Dessert Master."

222
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,060
The first round of the competition this year is online.

223
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:14,252
Each bakery makes a cake on a live stream for the judges.

224
00:22:14,252 --> 00:22:17,500
Atom. Peach. Help me with the online broadcast.

225
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,760
Will do.

226
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,630
Well, how do the judges know

227
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:25,220
if the cakes are delicious or not?

228
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,780
This is a qualification round, Peach.

229
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:30,480
They'll notice how contestants formulate recipes and make cakes.

230
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,440
The show challenges everyone to think of a new recipe according to their terms.

231
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:41,160
The show will choose only five dishes before the next round.

232
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,660
To be one of the five winners is good enough.

233
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,420
This show is famous throughout Asia.

234
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,220
This is their first broadcast in Thailand.

235
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,540
We must be number one.

236
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,920
So what's the challenge?

237
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:05,980
This year's challenge is making a cake with Thai ingredients.

238
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:18,100
This isn't your style, Shin. Will you make it?

239
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,470
I think Guy should help you. Are you okay with that?

240
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,040
Of course.

241
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,340
The one who can help me... is Peach.

242
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,580
Hey! Peach.

243
00:23:38,011 --> 00:23:40,220
I'm not sure about this, Phi.

244
00:23:52,987 --> 00:23:57,267
What's wrong, Phi? Are you worrying about Peach?

245
00:23:57,267 --> 00:23:59,500
Shin wants to talk to Peach alone.

246
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,840
I don't know if they will fight again.

247
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,730
Right,

248
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,800
I'm worried about my friend,

249
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,120
even though Shin is calmer now.

250
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,960
Don't worry about that.

251
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,960
It seems that Peach can handle this.

252
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,900
Ai Shin already asked me to order toddy palms.

253
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,880
- Toddy palm cake?
- Shush! Keep your voice down.

254
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,140
Everyone wants to copy our bakery's recipes.

255
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,540
You mustn't let anyone know what Shin's up to.

256
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,886
It'll get copied again. Get it?

257
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,560
What's with the two of you?

258
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,906
Let's go home.

259
00:24:35,906 --> 00:24:37,606
What about Peach?

260
00:24:37,606 --> 00:24:40,126
Come on. Just go home.

261
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,960
I know he can do it.

262
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,080
It's a sponge, right, Phi?

263
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,830
Yes.

264
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,900
You're getting better at this.

265
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:11,073
We'll make a sponge cake for today.

266
00:25:11,073 --> 00:25:13,433
It smells so good.

267
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:15,080
Does it?

268
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,700
What a waste, Phi.

269
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,600
- What do you mean?
- That's the delicious part, Phi.

270
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,840
- That cream stain looks tasty…
- What?

271
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,840
Where are you going?

272
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,453
It must be a burglar.

273
00:26:05,453 --> 00:26:07,383
What if that burglar had a gun?

274
00:26:07,383 --> 00:26:09,040
I have a pan.

275
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,960
Put it down.

276
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,753
You can stay here if you're scared.

277
00:26:14,517 --> 00:26:16,017
Don't go.

278
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,710
Ai 'Tom.

279
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,940
Ai Peach!

280
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,480
What did you drop on the floor? I was shocked!

281
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,900
It should be me who was shocked. What are you doing here this late?

282
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,840
I forgot my phone here.

283
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,380
- You forgot your phone? Let me smack you.
- Ouch!

284
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,460
You disturbed our work, you know that?

285
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,986
You hit me too hard.

286
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:55,540
I thought you were a burglar. It wasn't hard enough.

287
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,960
What do you want me to do?

288
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,580
Call you?

289
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,260
Here.

290
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,920
Take that, Jackass!

291
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,660
Go back home now!

292
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,480
Why are you still here?

293
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,980
You...

294
00:27:23,899 --> 00:27:25,340
Why are you taking photos?

295
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:30,160
I told you that you're cute when you smile.

296
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,120
- Really?
- Yes.

297
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,660
How about this?

298
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,840
Well…

299
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,920
Look for yourself.

300
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,580
You're cute, aren't you?

301
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,540
Delete them.

302
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,740
Why?

303
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,600
- Delete them.
- This is my phone.

304
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,500
You're cute.

305
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,060
Cute?

306
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,680
Cute, really?

307
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,600
Time to change the battery.

308
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,920
[Shin: Are you home yet?]

309
00:28:58,573 --> 00:29:03,413
[Peach: I'm going to sleep. Are you still up?]

310
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,281
[Shin: I'm going to bed too, ]

311
00:29:12,281 --> 00:29:15,841
[just so you know, you can be late tomorrow. I've told Ohb.]

312
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,080
[Peach: Yes, Chef.]

313
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:35,440
Hey, Phi, yesterday, I made a toddy palm cake this high with P'Shin.

314
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,220
Really?

315
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:41,199
Showing off advanced techniques like that is such a Shin thing to do.

316
00:29:41,199 --> 00:29:44,340
How many layers? Seven?

317
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,875
Did you read his mind?

318
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,619
But…

319
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,380
P'Shin let me layer the cake.

320
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,880
It collapsed at the fourth layer.

321
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,400
Don't worry, Peach. It was your first time.

322
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,200
Practice carefully.

323
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:09,580
I have a photo of when the cake collapsed.

324
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,900
It's this one.

325
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,160
I saw P'Shin laugh, so I took photos of him

326
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,700
It's a rare sight.

327
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,977
Do you like Shin?

328
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,380
Why do you ask me like that?

329
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:51,060
Come on, Phi. It's impossible.

330
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,840
It's good you don't like him.

331
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:04,113
What do you mean?

332
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,343
Nothing.

333
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,940
Then I'm going now.

334
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,920
What's going on between you and my friend?

335
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,140
What is it?

336
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:58,940
Phi, you and Peach have been acting strangely intimate.

337
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,313
Are you guys dating?

338
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,860
Confess now.

339
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,700
Are you crazy?

340
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,860
How is that possible?

341
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,779
I don't even like him.

342
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:18,560
Frankly, he's annoying.

343
00:32:19,652 --> 00:32:24,540
He always comes up with strange ideas that he always chatting about.

344
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,552
You know that, right?

345
00:32:31,506 --> 00:32:35,306
It's good that you don't like him, Phi.

346
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,359
Because Peach is a decent guy.

347
00:32:41,611 --> 00:32:44,930
I don't want to see him hurt because of you.

348
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,600
Like someone you know.

349
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,340
I can smell the frustration on you again.

350
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,900
It's so strong this time.

351
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:26,140
What's wrong? Why are you sad?

352
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,860
It's Ai Shin again, right?

353
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,200
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.

354
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,880
Hey, Phi.

355
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,707
No one hurt me.

356
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,540
Peach, you don't have to protect him.

357
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,500
Hey, Phi.

358
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,000
I heard P'Shin say that...

359
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,960
I'm an annoying and nosy guy.

360
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,900
Didn't you say you don't like him?

361
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,280
You wouldn't be sad like this if you didn't.

363
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:44,783
I think you should move on.

364
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,906
Don't waste your time on that kind of guy.

365
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,520
You're more precious than you think.

366
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,340
Hey, Phi.

367
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,100
Is there also something troubling you?

368
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,040
Well, a bit.

369
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,752
But I believe that everyone has their own problems.

370
00:35:19,752 --> 00:35:21,465
It's okay.

371
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,760
Is it about your work, Phi?

372
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:37,240
You know what? I like making cakes more than pies.

373
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,420
- But...
- Oh.

374
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,700
I've never seen you make cakes.

375
00:35:47,706 --> 00:35:50,606
That's because Shin is better at it than me.

376
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:53,560
He bakes better cakes than I do.

377
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:01,206
I've never been able to beat Shin. I have always been second.

378
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,660
No one remembers the second place.

379
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,460
So I just do what Ai Shin doesn't.

380
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:17,780
At least I can be remembered in some way.

381
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,706
Hey, Phi, don't think too much about it.

382
00:36:23,706 --> 00:36:29,790
You can make cakes for me. I want to taste your baking.

The bakery uses your photo.

396
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,720
Yes, Phi.

397
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:48,660
I want to tell you guys that

398
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,700
this is the last day I work here.

399
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:02,440
P'Guy? Will you really quit?

I told you I never wanted to compete with you.

You don't…

but I do.

407
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,200
When I stay at this café, I'll just keep being another chef.

408
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,920
I don't want to be that forever.

- Shin.

410
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:04,280
Answer me! Am I your friend?

411
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,380
- Answer me! Guy.
- Shin. Take it easy.

412

- Shin. Shin.

413

- Enough.

- Let him go.

You too, Ai Guy. Can't you think it over again?

418
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:24,326
You shouldn't do this. Why don't you tell us what you want?

419
00:39:24,326 --> 00:39:26,600
You shouldn't do this.

420

- Hey.
