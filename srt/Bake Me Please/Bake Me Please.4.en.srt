Listen to me, Peach. I was startled when I woke up and tumbled.

6
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,980
That's all that happened. Okay?

7
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,840
Are you afraid that others will know what I saw?

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,580
- Don't move too much. It will—
- Ai Ohb,

9
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,280
it's okay.

10
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,460
My arm is injured because of you.

11
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,720
You must make up for it.

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,860
What's going on between you and my friend?

13
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:59,140
Are you guys dating?
- Are you nuts? How is that possible?

14
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,920
I want to tell you guys that

15
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,940
this is the last day I work here.

16
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,320
Someone abandoned me again, Peach.

17
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,920
You still have me.

18
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,480
Hey, Phi. Are you still thinking of Guy?

19
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,820
Oh, no, Phi! It's almost nine!

20
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,400

27
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,300
I've been waiting since morning.

28
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,760
- I've been waiting for a long time.
- It's so hot.

29
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,820
- Ai Peach, Peach.
- Watch where you're going.

30
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,580
What are you doing?

31
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,700
- This is bad.
- Peach…

32
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,200
Peach doesn't answer, either, Phi! What should we do?

33
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,000
Making pies in Guy's stead is tiring enough.

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,560
I can't make cakes alone.

35
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,160
I think we must tell the customers there is no torta caprese today.

36
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,020
The customers have been waiting since the early morning.

37
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,790
They'll kill you if you say no.

38
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,380
- So be it.
- We're here!

39
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,400
- Why didn't you answer my call?
- Peach.

40
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,379
Let's go.

41
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,420
- I'm saved.
- What are you waiting for?

42
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,180
Go with them!

43
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,460
Nong, tell me if you're ready to sell or not?

44
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,420
I'm really sorry. Please be patient.

45
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,680
It's been a long time.

46
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,600
We apologize for the delay.

47
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,380
It's because we have some difficulties.

48
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,700
We'll give a discount for customers with a number.

49
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,180
- They're so slow.
- It's hot.

50
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,980
I've been waiting since morning.

51
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,820
- This is unacceptable.
- We're really sorry.

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,020

You can come inside our bakery.

56
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,180
- Do come in. Come in.
- It looks delicious.

We welcome you all. It looks very delicious.

00:04:53,824 --> 00:04:55,960
We've made it.

60
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,500
It's a bro fist.

61
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,183
Why are you smiling that much, Phi?

62
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,080
Your face is stained.

63
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,300
Oh, that's why.

64
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,760
I wondered why customers smiled at me.

65
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,800
I thought they fell for my charms.

66
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,580
Yeah, yeah.

67
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,380
I got shy for nothing.

68
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,863
Is the stain gone?

69
00:05:43,863 --> 00:05:45,775
No.

70
00:05:45,775 --> 00:05:47,284
Let me see.

71
00:05:51,623 --> 00:05:53,683
It's almost gone.

72
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,111
You are so cute.

73
00:05:58,989 --> 00:06:02,740
Then how about I leave it there.

74
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,840
It's cute, right?

75
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,640
Do you want some?

76
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,800
Well… Sorry for interrupting you two.

77
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,820
I'm going!

78
00:06:36,386 --> 00:06:39,661
Atom! 'Tom! 'Tom!

79
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:44,220
Listen to me. You saw nothing back there. Got it?

80
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,200
Last time, you told me you didn't have any feelings for my friend.

81
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,160
That was then. Now, it's different.

82
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,220
Then why hide it?

83
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,560
Is my friend not good enough?

84
00:06:57,232 --> 00:07:00,379
Shut your mouth and do what I say.

85
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,220
Fine.

86
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,590
I'll keep my mouth shut for you.

87
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,572
But remember this, Phi.

88
00:07:07,572 --> 00:07:10,332
If you hurt my friend,

89
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,040
I'll kill you!

90
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,620
I'm eating dinner with you,

91
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,960
but you don't look happy at all.

92
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,580
Come on, Ai 'Tom. I'm just tired.

93
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:35,165
I must help Shin make cakes after the meal.

94
00:07:40,552 --> 00:07:43,040
What's with you and P'Shin?

95
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,080
Are you two together?

96
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,000
Spit it out.

97
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,420
I don't know. I never asked him about that.

98
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,483
What? A relationship must be clear.

99
00:08:01,483 --> 00:08:04,249
Doing this is like you're not honest with him.

100
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,460
You're overthinking, Ai 'Tom.

101
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,840
Give me some more time. It will all be clear eventually.

102
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,660
As you wish.

103
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,240
Have fun living in your fantasy world.

104
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,560
You can't.

105
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,260
I want to try it.

106
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,900
Peach.

107
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:50,221
Taste it properly.

108
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,020
Aromatic, soft, and rich.

109
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,520
This recipe is good.

110
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:15,500
It tastes like the toddy palm cakes I ate when I was young.

111
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,086
Really?

112
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,260
I think the aroma is too milky.

113
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,648
Add less milk next time.

114
00:10:31,906 --> 00:10:34,686
I don't sense that kind of aroma.

115
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:42,020
Can we try it again tomorrow?

116
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,100
I'm tired now, Phi.

117
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,285
Then come and sleep over at my house.

118
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,269
It's already late.

119
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:07,300
No, I'm sleepy and tired.

120
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,440
I can drive for you.

121
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,700
Sleep at my place for a night.

122
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,580
Will you let me sleep?

123
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,500
I wonder? From the look on your face, Phi,

124
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,960
I don't think so.

125
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,700
Of course, I'll let you sleep.

126
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,580
I promise.

127
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,160
Okay?

128
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,232
Let's go.

129
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,307
Ai Ohb?

130
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,851
Are you drunk?

131
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,120
You know that, do you?

132
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,220
I want to talk with you.

133
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,895
What is it?

134
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:16,180
Peach, wait for me outside.

135
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,758
Phi...

136
00:12:19,758 --> 00:12:21,733
Please do it.

137
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,065
All right.

138
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,101
What's the matter?

139
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,050
I heard how you talked with Atom about you and Peach.

140
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,460
Yes.

141
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,000
So I made you get drunk?

142
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,920
How is he better than me?

143
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,640
I always cared for you and stayed by your side the whole time.

144
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,229
How come it's not me?

145
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,120
You're too drunk.

146
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,560
- I don't talk with someone drunk.
- Hey.

147
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,540
Sorry, it took so long.

148
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:22,433
It's okay, Phi.

149
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:26,060
What did you talk to P'Ohb about?

150
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,060
It's an issue in the bakery.

151
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,124
Did you get bitten by mosquitoes?

152
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,966
Let's go.

153
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,060
Why are you up so early, Peach? It's the weekend.

154
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:19,709
It's my habit.

155
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:22,580
I'll go wash up.

156
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,800
Wait.

157
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,420
What...

158
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,140
will we do today?

159
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,500
I want to try Chef Yod's pastry.

160
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,441
I saw a lot of people sharing the place.

161
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,160
Why?

162
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,520
What's wrong?

163
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,798
Well, people must wait for Chef Table's Chef Yod's pastry for a month,

164
00:16:01,798 --> 00:16:06,521
even if they order it today, Peach.

165
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,600
Phi, this is Chef Table, Chef Yod's café.

166
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,380
It's my dream café.

167
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,523
Your dream café?

168
00:16:19,523 --> 00:16:24,400
Does it mean you'll leave our bakery?

169
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,060
It's not like that.

170
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,120
I just want to taste one, at least once.

171
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,060
Please?

172
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,260
Please…

173
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,500
Let's go another day, Peach.

174
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,930
Let's cook breakfast here today.

175
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:51,060
I'll check the ingredients downstairs.

176
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,500
"A new scrumptious almond cake recipe from Sweetheart."

177
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,860
"No need to wait in line, and it sells all day long."

178
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:14,470
That's a review for P'Guy's bakery, Phi.

179
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,440
Let me try.

180
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:29,320
Less flour and more almonds.

181
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,060
The taste is exactly like ours.

182
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:35,520
Phi, don't tell me P'Guy stole our recipe.

183
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,311
I don't think so. Ai Guy won't do such a thing.

184
00:17:39,311 --> 00:17:43,500
You can't let that bakery become better than ours.

185
00:17:44,194 --> 00:17:46,974
We can't stop them from doing that.

186
00:17:46,974 --> 00:17:51,600
Now, Ai Shin focuses on competing in Dessert Master.

187
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,360
After the competition, he and I will create a new signature cake.

188
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,240
If the cake for the competition wins, make it and sell it.

189
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,780
No bakery can overtake us if we have a cake with a guaranteed award.

190
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:11,260
Then we promote it to show that we're the real deal.

191
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:14,108
Yes, Mom.

192
00:18:14,108 --> 00:18:17,769
By the way, how is Shin's toddy palm cake?

193
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:20,080
He's making it.

194
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,100
You know he won't let anyone taste his cake if it's not finished.

195
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,880
I have no idea, Mom.

196
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,760
Why don't you help Shin make the cake?

197
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,100
Tell me.

198
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:41,100
Mom. Guy quit.

199
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,640
So 'Tom focuses on making pies, not cakes.

200
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,125
Come on. The cake is for the competition, 'Tom.

201
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,549
You must have a part in it.

202
00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:54,450
It will be good on your resumé.

203
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:57,500
What am I supposed to do with a resumé?

204
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,940
Guy was your friend,

205
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,800
but he left you to work with our competitor.

206
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,880
If Shin does the same,

207
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,880
our bakery will be doomed.

208
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,360
You must help your brother to sustain the bakery.

209
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,320
Grandma.

210
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,020
Grandma.

211
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,480
Do you need anything, Chef Shin?

212
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,160
You can call me Shin.

213
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,080
I need your help today.

214
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,320
You know how to make cakes.

215
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,790
Why do you need me to teach you?

216
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,700
I want to know, Grandmother,

217
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,300
why your cakes are so tasty.

218
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:06,620
I already told Shin that there's nothing special.

219
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,380
Special?

220
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,560
What you need is love and care.

221
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,300
Be happy while making cakes

222
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,040
and be considerate of the customers.

223
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,760
That's it.

224
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,250
Do you have any of them?

225
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,120
Do you have any of them?

226
00:20:52,346 --> 00:20:53,721
How is it, Phi?

227
00:20:53,721 --> 00:20:55,741
It's so aromatic.

228
00:20:55,741 --> 00:20:57,340
Good.

229
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,500
Come…

230
00:21:00,588 --> 00:21:01,819
Hot.

231
00:21:01,819 --> 00:21:03,381
Hey, let me see!

232
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,400
Show me your hand.

233
00:21:18,732 --> 00:21:20,712
Be careful.

234
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,660
I'll tell Ai Shin. You can pretend to make a cake when mom goes there.

235
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,460
What if I don't want to do it, Phi?

236
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,620
What do you mean?

237
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,080
What mom said

238
00:22:04,466 --> 00:22:07,909
makes me not want to open my own bakery, Phi.

239
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,400
I hate it.

240
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,635
I hate competing with others.

241
00:22:12,635 --> 00:22:15,210
All the scheming...

242
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,900
What do you want to do?

243
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,980
I'll tell mom.

244
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,000
I still don't know.

245
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,220
I'm all grown up, but I still can't find my passion.

246
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,540
I'm such a good-for-nothing.

247
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,840
It's all right. You don't have to hurry.

248
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,420
At least you know that you don't want to start a bakery.

249
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:50,520
Though you don't like it, you must help me for now.

250
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,720
Tell me when you know what you want to do.

251
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,860
Your brother will make your dream come true.

252
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,740
Don't give me that look. It's creepy.

253
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,840
I love you, P'Ohb.

254
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,780
I know.

255
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,380
Thank you, Grandmother.

256
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:39,899
Your cake is delicious, as always.

257
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,460
Thank you, Dear.

258
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:49,160
The secret is love and care from the maker.

259
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,680
What about you? Do you love someone?

260
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,580
Do you have feelings for my grandson?

261
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,940
Grandma! Why do you ask him that?

262
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,380
Don't think that I'm old and don't know anything.

263
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:08,280
I can see that you like my grandson, Shin.

264
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,960
P'Shin, P'Shin, let's go before the traffic jam.

265
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,525
Let's go, Phi.

266
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,871
Yes, I do.

267
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:18,480
Peach and I are dating, Grandmother.

268
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,100
Phi, my grandmother has heart disease.

269
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:41,100
Sorry, I didn't think carefully.

270
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:48,120
But I want you to know that I'm serious about you.

271
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,580
Thank you, Phi.

272
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:58,240
I'm so relieved and happy.

273
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,640

274
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,180
Phi, wait, wait.

275
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,520

276
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,860
Sorry. I forgot myself.

277
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:34,140
Please take care of my grandson.

278
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,680
Are you okay with this?

279
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,400
Why wouldn't I be okay?

280
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,480
Peach. I've raised you since you were young.

281
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,160
Of course, I know everything about you.

282
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,840
There is no problem at all.

283
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,877
I'm glad you're with a good man,

284
00:26:01,877 --> 00:26:05,020
and I entrust you to him.

285
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,748
I'm so relieved.

286
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,380
You can rest assured.

287
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,100
I'll take very good care of your grandson.

288
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,740
Thank you so much, Dear. Thank you.

289
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,329
Take care of each other.

290
00:26:22,329 --> 00:26:23,860
I will.

291
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,560
Are you happy?

292
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,160
I'm relieved grandma accepted us.

293
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:56,800
At first, I thought you were lucky

294
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,920
to get love from people around you.

295
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,600
But the truth is…

296
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,900
your grandmother taught you to love others,

297
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,020
so they love you back.

298
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,920
But I didn't love you first.

299
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,800
You were the one who fell for me.

300
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,120
What? It's you who liked me first.

301
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,720
What did you say?

302
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
You're being a rascal.

303
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,020
Stop that.

304
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,160
Squishy.

305
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,580
There's one more thing I want to ask of you.

306
00:27:54,500 --> 00:28:00,180
Don't tell anyone at the bakery that we're together.

307
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,960
Why, Phi?

308
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:14,380
It's better not to let anyone know.

309
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,360
I still don't understand what you're saying.

310
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,840
Please. Trust me.

311
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,260

Would you like to make an appointment now?

317
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,340
Can I do that later? It's not convenient right now.

318
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:05,720
Of course. You could make an appointment via our after-sales service website,

319
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,100
T-Connect app, or the center's number.

320
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:14,540
I see. Do you have an outdoor battery change service?

321
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:17,620
We do. We can provide you the service outdoors.

322
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:21,980
Is your Toyata's model a 2022 Camry?
- Yes.

00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:28,160

363
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,260
Peach, I've brought my car in for service.

364
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,940
You go ahead and buy the cake ingredients.

365
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,370
Okay, I'll hurry there. I won't be late.

366
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,110
What is this, Phi?

367
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,340
I took my car to the car center.

368
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:16,620
The challenge of Dessert Master is Thai ingredients.

369
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:23,649
So I used ripened toddy palm fruits for this cake like the traditional dessert.

370
00:35:23,649 --> 00:35:29,165
The cream is mixed with young toddy palm fruits to create texture and aroma.

371
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:34,189
Most importantly, the cake is organically made.

372
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:01,000
Tasty. It has a Thai vibe but with the smoothness of cakes.

373
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,544
How is it?

374
00:36:02,544 --> 00:36:03,880
It's aromatic, Phi,

375
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,240
and it tastes like a traditional toddy palm cake, Phi.

376
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,420
It's a bit too sweet, though.

377
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:18,460
But if you eat it with tea or coffee, it should be okay.

378
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,780
Lousy.

379
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,820
How come, Mom? It's good.

380
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,260
It must be more delicious.

381
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,020
Where do you get the fruits from?

382
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:52,020
From a farm in Petchaburi?

383
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:55,220
Put in more toddy palm fruits.

384
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:58,400
But the cake won't be fluffy if I use too much.

385
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,080
That's a chef's problem.

386
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,580
And the decoration is too plain.

387
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:06,180
Any bakery can do the same.

388
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,140
This isn't good enough.

389
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,870
Sorry.

390
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:58,229
Please don't be mad at my mom.

391
00:37:58,229 --> 00:38:04,409
She's harsh because she wants the cake to win.

392
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,122
Am I like this?

393
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:18,020
I'm mean to others,

394
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,280
saying it's out of good intentions.

395
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,180
I felt terrible when I was treated that way myself.

396
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,580
I hate it.

397
00:38:33,337 --> 00:38:35,460
Why?

398
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,320
Can't people say it nicely if they…

399
00:38:42,502 --> 00:38:44,802
really care about each other?

400
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,760
I can't believe… I heard that from you.

[Come Again, We're Closed]

402
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:42,300
Thank you… for changing me for the better.

403
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:52,240
But it's better if you tell me…

404
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,640
why we can't be together openly.

405
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:05,860
I don't want to mix my job with my personal life.

406
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:08,520
People will doubt me.

407
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,050
Who are those "people"?

408
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:15,780
P'Ohb or Atom?

409
00:40:16,491 --> 00:40:18,391
Oh, Peach.

410
00:40:21,629 --> 00:40:26,889
Isn't it good enough that we love each other?

411
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,263
Are we good?

412

413
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,620
You're my baby.

414

I'll buy some stuff.

Are you together with Shin?

431
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,780
You can say that, Phi.

432
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,180
I know you warned me about him,

433
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:03,640
but he's not the same now.

434
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,600
I'm glad you're happy.

435
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,760
How are you, Phi?

436
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,840
The bakery you work for is very popular.

437
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:22,400
Great. The job is challenging, and the staff at the bakery values me.

438
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,844
What about you?

439
00:44:24,844 --> 00:44:27,720
Nothing much, Phi.

Do you want to join me? He lets me invite a friend.

442
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,960
Chef Yod, Phi?

443
00:44:38,819 --> 00:44:43,039
I can remember you wanting to try pastry there, right?

444
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:46,821
Absolutely! I asked P'Shin to reserve a cake,

445
00:44:46,821 --> 00:44:48,761
but he didn't do it.

446
00:44:48,761 --> 00:44:51,760
Do you want to come? You don't need to reserve anything.

447

He'll kill me if I go with you.

Didn't you say he has changed?

449
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,840
From what you said, he's still the same.

450
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,880
He's transforming himself.

451
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,880
