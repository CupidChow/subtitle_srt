1
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,660
I didn't have any friends during high school.

2
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,360
My teacher would often worry about me.

3
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,210
The shortest distance is to go by a roundabout way.

4
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,850
SIX MONTHS AGO

5
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,010
Mind if I sit here?

6
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:06,300
Mr. Aoyama was the newly
appointed Japanese language teacher.

7
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,570
What are you reading?

8
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,780
Sorry. That was a nosy question.

9
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,250
Was it?

10
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:27,220
I wouldn't appreciate being asked that either.

11
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,050
I don't mind. It's nothing suspicious.

12
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,050
You're reading noir?

13
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,250
You're up here a lot, huh?

14
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,210
I don't have any friends.

15
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,220
I see.

16
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,080
I was the same.

17
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,200
I can't wait to read it.

18
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,930
It's nothing special.

19
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,210
Fancy exchanging diaries with me?

20
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,900
Huh?

21
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:43,000
He probably offered because he
was concerned about me being alone.

22
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,880
I never had a problem with being lonely, but

23
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,310
his old-fashioned idea of exchanging diaries seemed attractive to me.

24
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:04,750
What's more, we seemed quite alike which further piqued my interest in him.

25
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:15,050
"Today Mom told me she'd take on a part-time job. She got married at 29, had me at 30, then divorced at 31.

26
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:20,400
Most sons would wanna help out, but I see her as a foolish woman who got married too soon.

27
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,500
Is my way of thinking wrong? Maybe that's why I can't get on at school..."

28
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:49,210
Three months had passed since
we started exchanging diaries.

29
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:53,500
I got a fever, and took the day off school.

30
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,840
Haruto!

31
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,530
Mr. Aoyama came out of his way to pay you a visit.

32
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,080
Hi. How you feeling?

33
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:27,770
Mr. Aoyama, forgive me. I have to leave for work.

34
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,370
Please, take your time.

35
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,650
Well?

36
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,900
It's come down, but I still have a fever.

37
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,470
You should probably keep resting then.

38
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,000
What the...?

39
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,900
What the hell are you doing!?

40
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,840
I've written another diary entry, so...

41
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,430
I ain't interested!

42
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,120
- Haruto!
- What's your problem!?

43
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:28,370
Get out! Now!

44
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,370
Get outta my house!

45
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,810
Now!

46
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,570
Are you deaf or something!?

47
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,250
- I'm sorry.
- Get out!

48
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:01,580
I reported him for sexual harassment.

49
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,250
He was fired by the school soon after.

50
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:14,560
I went on to graduate without ever seeing him again.

51
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,110
Mr. Aoyama...

52
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,790
I...

53
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:46,530
THREE YEARS LATER

54
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:11,820
Though it's been three years, I still
have the same dream every day.

55
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,720
Seeking a different life, I became a host.

56
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,560
Hey, Yuki...

57
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,530
Open wide!

58
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,020
Yuki was my host name.

59
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,640
Taste good?

60
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,930
One more bite!

61
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,980
I've had enough!

62
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:00,270
I'll create a scene if you don't eat up!

63
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,600
Tell me Minami, how
much can you spend tonight?

64
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,790
Around 200,000 yen?

65
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,950
I see...

66
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,500
Actually, I have a favor to ask of you.

67
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,280
Such as?

68
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,600
Can you give me a million yen directly?

69
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,540
You're the only one I can ask!

70
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:37,070
My client ran off without paying.

71
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,370
She owed 3 million yen.

72
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,310
Why should I foot another woman's drink bill?

73
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,840
Because you're the only one I can ask!

74
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:52,590
I'll be fired if I don't get it back. I won't ever see you again!

75
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,570
Is that what you want?

76
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,940
If I give you the money,

77
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,440
what will you give me in return?

78
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,040
I'll make sweet love to you all night.

79
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,360
You mean that?

80
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,750
Ryoma, welcome back!

81
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,250
Welcome back!

82
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,980
Yuki, you can't make deals in private.

83
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,080
That's a no-no.

84
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,760
How did you know?

85
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,220
A customer named Minami filed a complaint.

86
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:45,770
Says you wouldn't sit with her
despite giving you a million yen.

87
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,160
Allow me!

88
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,980
Well, that'll be a million yen fine,

89
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,480
plus the million she gave you.

90
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:03,370
Also, an extra million for damages.
That's 3 million total by the end of the month.

91
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,120
Oh, I forgot. You still owe me 3 million.

92
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,300
6 million total.

93
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,090
I can't pay that!

94
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,050
Don't you try running away either.

95
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,440
Let me show you what'll happen if you do.

96
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,970
Wake him up.

97
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,340
Hey, get out here!

98
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,320
Come on, move!

99
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:43,470
Meet Yoshiki. A former host who tried pulling the same shit you did.

100
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:48,300
No matter where you run, we'll find you, and fuck you up even worse.

101
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,080
I ran away the following day.

102
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:18,260
I had no money, and no place to go.

103
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,250
I spent several days sleeping under this bridge.

104
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,210
It wasn't the continuation of my dream, though.

105
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,020
Mr. Aoyama?

106
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,520
I'm really...

107
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,260
sorry for what I did.

108
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,280
That's all in the past.

109
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:10,720
Unable to find anywhere willing to hire a teacher charged with obscenity,

110
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:17,010
Mr. Aoyama chose to hide himself from the world.

111
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:25,300
I also told him about the events that
lead me here after graduation.

112
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,970
Here, take this.

113
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,900
That's 2 million yen.

114
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,500
It's not enough, I know.

115
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,760
I can't accept this much money!

116
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,620
These past 3 years...

117
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,260
I never once forgot about you.

118
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,520
Don't you hate me for what I did?

119
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,240
Hate you? What for?

120
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,620
If I hadn't reported you to the school,

121
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,900
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

122
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,480
I'm glad you did.

123
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,000
If you hadn't,

124
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,300
I might have taken things too far.

125
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:01,440
Even so, I'm not accepting this!

126
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:14,570
Do you remember writing this?

127
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,030
I still read it from time to time.

128
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,930
It's my treasure, after all.

129
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:33,310
Maybe the two of us...

130
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,320
were destined to meet.

131
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:04,540
The following day, Mr. Aoyama went into town to sell his empty cans.

132
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,490
That 3 year period definitely changed me.

133
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:21,630
Though I wasn't sure if it was for the better.

134
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,700
Found you!

135
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,690
Hey, quit running!

136
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,750
- Get back here!
- Give him what for!

137
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,440
Okay, okay!

138
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,260
Oh, what an adorable face!

139
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,590
Now get your ass back here!

140
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,040
Quit fighting, you little punk!

141
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,410
Get your hands off me!

142
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,140
Shut up and keep walking!

143
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,460
I got him!

144
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,730
You've got money after all!

145
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,190
Really!?

146
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,820
Okay, let's go!

147
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,850
Yuki, I could do without this bullshit.

148
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,750
Forgive me.

149
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,320
What did I tell you?

150
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,560
You can run, but you can't hide.

151
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,480
I was gathering the money.

152
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,970
I have 2 million yen.

153
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,640
Are you fucking with me?
This ain't nearly enough!

154
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:47,330
Ryoma, please!

155
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,400
I'll work hard to get the rest!

156
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,210
Finding your ass costs money!

157
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,480
Now you owe me 10 million.

158
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,500
You can't be serious!

159
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:05,770
I guess we'll remove your organs in China.

160
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,900
Ryoma, please! Anything but that!

161
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,440
I know a place you can earn back what you owe.

162
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:54,780
"I'm sorry. I took your money.
I swear I'll pay you back."

163
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:09,140
Most of our clientele are distinguished gentlemen

164
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:12,200
with high social status and influence.

165
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:20,130
Such clients always seek the company of young men who are both beautiful and sexually attractive.

166
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,710
Each of our members enroll by paying a fixed amount.

167
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:32,420
Furthermore, they are closely vetted to ensure that nobody suspicious joins.

168
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,970
So I'm to sell my body to other men?

169
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:45,820
Our club simply provides a meeting place for our customers.

170
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,340
I know my stuff.

171
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:52,350
You're sure to be a hit among our clients.

172
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,830
Much like Ryoma was.

173
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:00,800
He came to me in search of work.

174
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:07,230
He had a strong desire to make money and go into business for himself.

175
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:14,400
He was hugely popular, and with the help of a powerful client, he finally realized his dream.

176
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:20,570
Yuki, do you have any experience with men?

177
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,640
No.

178
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:28,840
I see. Please get undressed and show me your body.

179
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:36,100
What, right now?

180
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:42,260
I wish to check if you're appropriate for our club.

181
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,520
Let me give you a hand.

182
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:33,360
You have a beautiful body.

183
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:37,540
Have you ever kissed a man before?

184
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:41,390
That's a yes.

185
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:11,050
Are those tears?

186
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:17,940
Nothing turns me on more than seeing a man cry.

187
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:43,470
You're hard.

188
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:25,250
Now, part your legs.

189
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,180
Relax your body.

190
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,150
As I suspected. You have potential.

191
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,380
Does it feel good?

192
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,870
I'm gonna cum.

193
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,650
I'm gonna cum!

194
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:44,910
How nice. You're still clenched tight.

195
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:04,860
I really wanted to see Mr. Aoyama.

196
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,800
Meet Seiya, our number one boy.

197
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,560
Nice to meet you.

198
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,800
I'm Yuki.

199
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:28,040
He came to pick up his earnings for the month.

200
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,780
This is just his salary.

201
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,530
He gets far more from his clients.

202
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:40,250
- Be seeing you, boss.
- Thanks for the hard work.

203
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,950
Best of luck.

204
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,290
Take a seat.

205
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:02,960
Like you, Seiya was also a
struggling host until a year ago.

206
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:09,870
He came here to pay off his debts,
and became an overnight success.

207
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:17,090
For boys like you, our clients are
like knights in shining armor.

208
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,520
They will save you from hell.

209
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:25,450
In return however, there's one
rule you must always uphold.

210
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,350
What is that?

211
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,110
To always remain beautiful.

212
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,990
We promise to pay you 30% of each engagement.

213
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:42,060
The more you have, the bigger the cut.

214
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:47,550
In return, any tips given to you
by the client are yours to keep.

215
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:48,890
However...

216
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,890
Private deals are off limits.

217
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,460
You know what I mean, right?

218
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,500
Yes.

219
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:02,130
There's a spare room upstairs.

220
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:06,220
Please live there until your debts have been paid off.

221
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:11,240
Our clients may request you at any hour.

222
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,530
Please be ready at all times.

223
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:28,420
That's when I vowed to become a knight in shining armor,

224
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:33,920
and save Mr. Aoyama from his own hell.

225
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:42,840
I was born on a small island off Kyushu.

226
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,330
We had a lot of goats on our family farm.

227
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:51,390
I'd begrudgingly help my dad look after them, but

228
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:56,320
there was one male goat who only seemed to like me.

229
00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:02,620
I hated looking after those dirty, smelly beasts, but that one goat was special.

230
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:09,660
We never named our livestock, but I called him Shiro and adored him no end.

231
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,200
Shiro and I were always together.

232
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:21,440
But, when I came home from
school one day, I went into his pen

233
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,260
and caught him mating with a female.

234
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:30,060
When I saw that, I was overcome by a strong emotion I'd never felt before.

235
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,780
Losing my temper,

236
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:38,500
I grabbed a nearby shovel and
bludgeoned them both to death.

237
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:45,440
My father asked why I did it,
before beating the crap out of me.

238
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:48,080
I couldn't tell him, though.

239
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:53,610
Who could blame me? I could never tell him I was jealous of a female goat.

240
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,920
Twenty years have passed,
and I have a wife and kid now.

241
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:13,490
But, I've never loved anyone more than Shiro.

242
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,640
I still see him sometimes.

243
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,540
He appears in my dreams

244
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,450
as a young man.

245
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,400
Shiro had beautiful fur.

246
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,890
His red collar suited him, too.

247
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,720
Shiro!

248
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,350
Shiro!

249
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,900
Oh, Shiro!

250
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:52,750
You were such a big goat!

251
00:34:56,170 --> 00:35:00,220
I stayed focused until it was over...

252
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:03,100
thinking only of Mr. Aoyama.

253
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,140
Shiro!

254
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,270
Thanks.

255
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,170
I finally fulfilled my 20 year old dream.

256
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,640
Thank you.

257
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,740
Seiya...

258
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,160
Turn around.

259
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:21,710
I hear Yuki's been getting more requests lately.

260
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,720
That's right.

261
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,530
He's quite the hit.

262
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,770
What's so good about him?

263
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,290
Why would you ask something like that?

264
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:35,050
Well, it's only natural to feel concerned.

265
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,500
Is that jealousy I hear?

266
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,720
It's rivalry.

267
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:47,690
If you're so keen to learn about him,
why not sleep with him yourself?

268
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:51,010
You're not one of our members, but...

269
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,740
you have my permission.

270
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,940
Don't be ridiculous!

271
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:14,610
That evening, I was called to a private room in Roppongi

272
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,740
owned by a young IT director.

273
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:20,210
Just so you know, I ain't gay.

274
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:24,170
I've slept with dozens of models and cabin attendants,

275
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,820
but never with a guy.

276
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:32,590
I'm told they're better than girls, so figured I'd give it a go.

277
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:37,090
I'm not gay either, so I can't guarantee your satisfaction.

278
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,100
I'm actually kinda relieved to hear that.

279
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:45,390
I probably would've run a mile if you were a massive fag.

280
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:51,070
People wanna try stuff when they've got money.

281
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:57,130
Like sailing around the world on a luxury cruiser, or riding a rocket into space.

282
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,170
I'm not like that, though.

283
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:07,020
I wanna explore the interests hidden in my
subconscious mind that I haven't noticed yet.

284
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,580
I understand.

285
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,500
Wow, you've got me hard.

286
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,720
Can you stroke mine, too?

287
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:31,080
Can you suck mine, too?

288
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:50,660
Give or take. Which do you prefer?

289
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,290
I've come this far, so I'll try taking it.

290
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:04,730
I'll need you to relax a little, so lift your ass up.

291
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:18,060
Okay, here goes.

292
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,220
I'll start thrusting.

293
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,570
Wow!

294
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,710
My gut feels like it's gonna explode!

295
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,660
I can't hold back!

296
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,680
We're not finished yet.

297
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:42,340
Stop!

298
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,920
I'm spent!

299
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,420
How nostalgic.

300
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:32,590
I used to live here too.

301
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,310
I know.

302
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,000
Mr. Yazaki told me.

303
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:44,410
He told me a few things, too.
I hear you're a hit with the clients.

304
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:50,210
Screwing guys is hell when you're not gay.

305
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:53,060
I had my reasons, though.

306
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,060
I did anything for money.

307
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:00,090
I'd lick their assholes, even drink their piss.

308
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,340
I thought of dying many times.

309
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:08,540
I completely changed after a year, though.

310
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,680
How so?

311
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,560
There's something about you that's attractive to men.

312
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:26,600
Are you offering to buy my services?

313
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:28,120
Yeah.

314
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,640
I've already cleared it with Yazaki.

315
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,650
Okay.

316
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:46,250
I knew from the start what Ryoma was after.

317
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:52,210
Guys who want to fuck me all have the same eyes.

318
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:11,090
I've wanted to do this ever since you came to my club.

319
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,270
Yuki!

320
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:29,020
Yuki!

321
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:30,670
Stop!

322
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:34,830
That's enough!

323
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,560
Before I could realize...

324
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:57,330
I stopped dreaming of Mr. Aoyama.

325
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,650
You don't seem as busy these days.

326
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:05,980
I'm aware of that!

327
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,460
My clients are requesting Yuki instead.

328
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:13,650
Even so, you're still our number one.

329
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:18,580
Please try giving them more bang for their buck.

330
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:28,530
I thought about what you said...

331
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:33,760
I want to sleep with Yuki.

332
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:41,050
Very well. I'll speak with him.

333
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,800
When I was a host...

334
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,970
I used to come here to get away from it all.

335
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,180
You know what they say...

336
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:12,730
Doing what you love for a living is a bad idea.

337
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:19,690
I became a host because I love women, but I loathe being around them now.

338
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,240
Can I ask you something?

339
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:27,340
Why me?

340
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,220
I'm the number one choice at our club.

341
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:38,760
It won't be long before you overtake me, though.

342
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:47,380
Not that I care.

343
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:50,740
I'm getting tired of the job anyway.

344
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:03,060
Your clients all tell Yazaki the same thing.

345
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:10,180
They say you bring a seriousness that exceeds technique.

346
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:18,040
How is that possible for a straight guy like you?

347
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,480
I wanna find out for myself.

348
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,660
You know about me and Yazaki, right?

349
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:04,730
The club's number one automatically becomes his partner.

350
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:09,600
They get a much bigger cut of the earnings, too.

351
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:11,200
Naturally...

352
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,760
they get introduced to the wealthier clients as well.

353
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:31,390
I'm past caring about the money, though.

354
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:35,360
I've earned more than enough!

355
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:43,800
I just...

356
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:48,490
can't bear the thought of losing Yazaki!

357
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,980
That's why...

358
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,130
I wanna stay number one!

359
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:57,450
A hotel worker came to my aid,

360
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:01,230
and I was hospitalized for a month.

361
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:07,410
The loss of blood was so severe, that another 10 minutes on the hotel floor

362
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:10,370
would have cost me my life.

363
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,080
Are you okay?

364
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:25,530
Furthermore...

365
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:30,080
I lost my penis in the process.

366
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:39,080
I paid Ryoma the remainder of your debt.

367
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:46,770
What happened to Seiya?

368
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:50,160
I don't know where he is.

369
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:56,990
If the police catch him and he talks about his job,

370
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,940
I will be implicated too.

371
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:03,790
The club will close down, too.

372
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:12,600
Here's 5 million yen for your
medical and living expenses.

373
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,530
What's more, should anything happen to me,

374
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:27,790
I've got a friend managing the club's finances.

375
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:30,560
I'll tell you his address, so please remember it.

376
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:51,540
I've erased all record of you being at the club.

377
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:55,520
You won't have any further trouble.

378
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:11,100
That was the last I saw of Yazaki, too.

379
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,140
ONE MONTH LATER

380
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:40,480
After leaving hospital, I went to the
river to fulfill my promise to Mr. Aoyama.

381
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:08,060
This is my house now.

382
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:14,530
Yazaki's club had also gone.

383
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:26,600
I visited the address he gave me.

384
00:56:16,365 --> 00:56:19,165
Haruto, I'm glad you came.

385
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,880
Come in.

386
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:33,230
So then, where shall I start?

387
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,611
Tell me everything.

388
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:42,060
I haven't a clue what's going on.

389
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,610
I'm sure you don't.

390
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,860
I've been watching over you...

391
00:56:56,650 --> 00:57:00,250
since the very beginning.

392
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,390
What do you mean?

393
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:11,790
From the moment you graduated and became a host.

394
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:16,300
What will you give me in return?

395
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:21,920
I'll make sweet love to you all night.

396
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:24,380
You mean that?

397
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,100
So, shall we go somewhere after this?

398
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:34,100
Anywhere you want.

399
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:37,300
There's a hotel I wanna check out...

400
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:46,490
My being homeless was just an act to get closer to you.

401
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:10,860
It was also me that told Ryoma where you were hiding.

402
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:13,160
Hello, Ryoma?

403
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,220
Yeah, it's me.

404
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,420
Understood.

405
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:27,820
I'll send the boys right away.

406
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:43,108
I also got Ryoma to threaten you, and introduce you to Yazaki's club.

407
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:49,490
How do you even know Yazaki?

408
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,820
He and I go further back.

409
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:05,060
After losing my teaching job, and having nowhere to go...

410
00:59:06,530 --> 00:59:09,720
I got a job in Shinjuku's gay district.

411
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,030
It was essentially...

412
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:16,700
a bar for rent boys.

413
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:55,640
Yazaki was a customer...

414
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:58,251
and he chose me.

415
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:35,970
Please take me from behind.

416
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,940
Yazaki took a shine to me,

417
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:11,337
and asked me to contractually become his lover.

418
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:19,080
I quit working at the bar, moved into this apartment, and began managing his club finances.

419
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,260
I slept with him many times, but...

420
01:01:34,810 --> 01:01:38,022
I only ever thought about you.

421
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:45,060
Where is he now?

422
01:01:49,930 --> 01:01:54,740
The world you escaped is all connected.

423
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:59,260
Yazaki, Seiya, Ryoma...

424
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:01,260
even me.

425
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,730
The moment I heard you started work at Ryoma's bar,

426
01:02:07,862 --> 01:02:09,931
I knew it was destiny.

427
01:02:10,571 --> 01:02:13,420
How much of this was your doing?

428
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:19,870
It was me who hired that girl at Ryoma's bar.

429
01:02:21,428 --> 01:02:24,034
I did it to get you in debt.

430
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:27,480
Was it to...

431
01:02:28,850 --> 01:02:31,530
take revenge on me?

432
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:34,430
Don't misunderstand me.

433
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:37,730
I just wanted you for myself.

434
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:40,220
You piece of shit!

435
01:02:42,285 --> 01:02:43,977
Thanks to you...

436
01:02:44,925 --> 01:02:47,520
I'm no longer a man!

437
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,771
I'm truly sorry.

438
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:52,160
That wasn't supposed to happen.

439
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:57,177
Seiya got what he deserved.

440
01:02:59,450 --> 01:03:01,440
What's that supposed to mean?

441
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,770
Right now he's...

442
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:09,390
napping at the bottom of the sea with Yazaki.

443
01:03:23,330 --> 01:03:24,770
Aoyama...

444
01:03:25,588 --> 01:03:27,980
I bit off Yuki's cock.

445
01:03:32,251 --> 01:03:33,520
Yeah...

446
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:39,960
You'll let me joint-manage the club now, right?

447
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:43,650
Right.

448
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:45,417
Understood.

449
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:49,740
Hey, let go!

450
01:03:57,211 --> 01:03:59,897
Just who are you anyway?

451
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:07,220
A devoted man who loves you dearly.

452
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:16,340
Yazaki has more than 100 million stashed away.

453
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:19,577
I wanna...

454
01:04:20,651 --> 01:04:23,810
make up for what you've been through.

455
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:29,620
Let's leave this place...

456
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,388
and live together overseas.

457
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:41,810
Hold it right there.

458
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:04,880
Here's the money I took from you.

459
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:14,491
Thank you.

460
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:56,680
I can't please you sexually.

461
01:06:00,810 --> 01:06:02,890
That's not true at all!

462
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:40,480
If only I had listened to my heart...

463
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,640
We definitely took the long way around.

464
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:47,660
But, it was time we both needed.

465
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:56,490
Which is why...

466
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:59,700
we'll always be together!

467
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,220
Haruto!

468
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,970
Haruto!

469
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:50,880
Mr. Aoyama!

470
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:39,210
The shortest distance is to go
by a roundabout way 【noir】
