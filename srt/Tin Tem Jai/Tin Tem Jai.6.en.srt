00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,300
(Tin Tem Jai)
(Episode 6)

2
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,170
Kana.

3
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,670
I want 5 eggs, please.

4
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:46,740
Wait a moment.

5
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:01,880
Here.

6
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,730
I want some snacks.

7
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,900
I want 2 raisin breads.

8
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,900
Why didn't you tell me at the start?

9
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:17,710
Here.

10
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,550
Thank you.

11
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:26,940
Kana.

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,410
Uncle Kai got drunk again.

13
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,290
You!

14
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,250
You don't go to work every day.

15
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,050
- You keep always going to the casino.
- What?

16
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,290
What do you know!

17
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,660
I just took the money to make money.

18
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,900
Really?

19
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,020
Where's the money?

20
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,180
I've never seen you earn even a dime.

21
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:46,990
Huh?

22
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,290
I have my expenses.

23
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,590
Expenses?

24
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,480
Expenses.

25
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,760
What's wrong with you?

26
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,440
It's because you...

27
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,700
What's wrong with you?

28
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,560
Why did you hit me?

29
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:05,830
Ouch...

30
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,490
Don't touch me!

31
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,140
F*ggot!

32
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,420
You keep go to the casino.
How will you be responsible?

33
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,690
What's wrong with you!?

34
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,470
Don't squeeze my belly. I'm ticklish.

35
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
Hey.

36
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,250
Park.

37
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,290
You're ruining my romantic mood.

38
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,560
Ride well.

39
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,140
- Yeah.
- Why are you so calm?

40
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,270
Yeah.

41
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,000
You keep going to the casino each day.

42
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,050
Kana.

43
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:32,810
Park.

44
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,240
Where have you guys been?

45
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,830
I waited for you for a very long time.

46
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,050
Why are you waiting for me?

47
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:37,790
What do you want to tell me?

48
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,420
I ran away from home.

49
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,020
Is it too far?

50
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,880
Park.

51
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,700
Why?

52
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:51,530
I'm...

53
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,660
Let me eat it.

54
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,140
No!

55
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,880
- No!
- Let me eat it!

56
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,940
Just buy it yourself.

57
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,130
You even bought a lot of them.

58
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,620
Let me eat it!

59
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:02,490
No.

60
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,050
Hey, there's another way.

61
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,220
Then...

62
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,460
What happened to your head?

63
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,180
My parents are arguing again.

64
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,750
I got caught in the crossfire.

65
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,130
So I ran away.

66
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,330
I think you fought with dogs.

67
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,720
You're the dog.

68
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,820
The dog is you.

69
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,710
Stop!

70
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,270
Tin.

71
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,790
Bring a first aid kit.

72
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,500
I'm going to grab it.

73
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,620
Don't scold me.

74
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,120
Get away.

75
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,880
Stop it.

76
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,670
Let me see.

77
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,790
Are you hurt?

78
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:03,770
Tin!

79
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,050
How long?

80
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,510
Ouch!

81
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,070
I'm coming.

82
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,270
Come here.

83
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,570
You treat me tenderly.

84
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,470
You never hurt me with first aid.

85
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,830
It's because your skin is thick.

86
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,020
Hey.

87
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,870
I'm not afraid if I'm sick and have you, Park.

88
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:49,450
I didn't want to treat my acquaintances.

89
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,060
You guys shouldn't cause trouble so often.

90
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,390
Do you get it?

91
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,190
What?

92
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:57,720
Hey.

93
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,430
Okay.

94
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,180
My parents often fight.

95
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:08,990
I'm annoyed.

96
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,000
Why are you in the rain?

97
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,040
Why don't you go to Pao or Barbie's house?

98
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,170
I'd rather come to your house.

99
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:32,640
(Since childhood, if someone's family had a problem,
everyone would run to Park's house)

100
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,270
Let me see.

101
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,480
Park, I'm hurt.

102
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,960
Tin, what happened to you?

103
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,130
Oh, you crashed your bike.

104
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,120
Gosh...

105
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,120
It' okay, kiddo.

106
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,070
I'll blow on it for you.

107
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,750
Abracadabra! You've recovered.

108
00:07:59,030 --> 00:07:59,880
You can apply the plaster right away.

109
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,410
Don't do it yet, otherwise your wound will be bruised.

110
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,810
Park.

111
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,080
My parents are arguing again.

112
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,970
It's okay.

113
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,380
You can stay at my house first.

114
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,870
Thank you, Park.

115
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,500
Kana.

116
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,630
Just play here.

117
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,170
Okay.

118
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,050
(Although it's not far,
but it's definitely safe from everything)

119
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,160
- (Because here there's Park who always listens and understands)
- Park, please download the game for me.

120
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,270
Sure.

121
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,080
Done!

122
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,740
Thank you, Park.

123
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,470
It's okay.

124
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,400
My game crashed. Can you fix it for me?

125
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,140
Sure.

126
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,570
Done.

127
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,600
Hi, Park.

128
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,350
Let's play some games?

129
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:51,130
Sure.

130
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:51,880
Hi, auntie.

131
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,590
Hello, kiddo.

132
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,100
What number do you have?

133
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,640
I have this number, let's exchange it.

134
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,240
- Let's exchange it.
- Sure.

135
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,240
You are too good.

136
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,500
You are very good.

137
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,290
Park.

138
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,500
Can I sleep with you tonight?

139
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,550
Just sleep on the floor!

140
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,540
You are tossing in your sleep.

141
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,100
Nobody wants to sleep with you.

142
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,110
Who do you mean?

143
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,430
I'm not like that!

144
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,800
Park.

145
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,630
I ran away from home.

146
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,090
Can you pity me?

147
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:39,850
Yeah.

148
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,960
Stop that!

149
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,720
People like you have to sleep on the streets

150
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,730
and can even be covered with newspapers.

151
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,030
I'm not in the mood to argue with you, Tin.

152
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,020
I didn't want to fight with you either.

153
00:09:58,690 --> 00:09:59,700
But I'm telling the truth.

154
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,930
Hey!

155
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,350
Stop arguing now.

156
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,200
Just change your clothes.

157
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,810
You both.

158
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,180
Just change your clothes!

159
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,590
I haven't even eaten anything yet.

160
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,340
Right now.

161
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,420
Go!

162
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:26,750
Annoying.

163
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,290
Go!

164
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,510
You too.

165
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,890
I shouldn't have been born, right?

166
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,010
Why do you say that?

167
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,930
My mother often told me that she made mistakes.

168
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,210
So she had to marry my father.

169
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,910
It's my fault that I was born.

170
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:33,460
Were you the one who told her to birth you?

171
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,640
Huh?

172
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,850
Did you tell your mother to give birth to you?

173
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,780
How can I do that?

174
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,150
So how is it your fault?

175
00:11:59,190 --> 00:11:59,850
Kana.

176
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:05,320
You haven't done anything wrong.

177
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,150
You were just born.

178
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,810
Why are you crying?

179
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,160
Huh?

180
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,850
I'm not crying.

181
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,580
What are you doing to me?

182
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,290
Does your house have a lot of dust?

183
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,010
I'm not crying.

184
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,670
Would you use it to stab me?

185
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,610
I won't die because of it.

186
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:52,740
Take it.

187
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:54,870
What about crab sticks?

188
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,370
No way!

189
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,590
Crab sticks are for Park.

190
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,850
How about fish balls?

191
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,060
The fish balls are mine.

192
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,710
Let me eat it.

193
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,990
No.

194
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,330
Let me eat it.

195
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,950
Just eat what I give you.

196
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,500
Please give me fish balls.

197
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:10,960
No.

198
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,620
- Let me eat.
- Hey!

199
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,050
You two.

200
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,250
I don't need it. I want fish balls.

201
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,580
Just eat what I give you.

202
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,050
I want fish balls.

203
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,540
No, I'm not giving it to you.

204
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,850
Why do you have so many problems?

205
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,170
Bring it back!

206
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,450
No.

207
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,430
I'll eat it.

208
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,770
Even if you bite,

209
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,440
I'll feed it to the dogs.

210
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:35,990
Bring it back!

211
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,840
Which dog will eat my sausage?

212
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,080
I hope the sausage sticks in your throat.

213
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:48,390
Hey.

214
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,510
I won't play with you.

215
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:53,910
Kana!

216
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,590
Damn!

217
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,110
Kana!

218
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,150
Kana!

219
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,290
What happened to you?

220
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,050
Tin, please give me space.

221
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,400
Kana!

222
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,300
Are you okay?

223
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,000
Are you okay?

224
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:21,790
Park.

225
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,690
I almost died, Park.

226
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,420
I thought you might be dead, Kana.

227
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,430
Look at you guys.

228
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,990
You fight until it causes problems.

229
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,980
If you guys share your meals,
it wouldn't be a problem.

230
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,850
I'm going to continue eating.

231
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:52,930
You guys are really...

232
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,890
Please sleep here tonight.

233
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,180
Yeah.

234
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,400
Thank you.

235
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,400
What happened? Why are you smiling alone?

236
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,620
I didn't smile.

237
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,590
My gums are itchy.

238
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,430
Are you going to sleep yet?

239
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:43,960
Yes.

240
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:45,810
I'll sleep.

241
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:46,920
Okay.

242
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:49,920
Park.

243
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,480
Huh?

244
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,030
I am cold.

245
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,140
Just turn off the fan if you're cold.

246
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,000
Park...

247
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,320
Why?

248
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,320
I thought you would hug me.

249
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,700
Why do I have to hug you?

250
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,420
Because I'm cold.

251
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,120
When sheltering from the rain, you can still hug me.

252
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,630
I'm just unaware.

253
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,230
You are unaware for a long time.

254
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,450
I thought you'd never hug me again.

255
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,380
How can I hug you?

256
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,330
I just got back from the hospital.

257
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,770
I haven't even taken a shower yet.

258
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,010
There's a lot of germs.

259
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,360
Before, you had never hugged me.

260
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,770
You seem to have stopped hugging me since high school.

261
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,930
It's because you've grown up.

262
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,680
So, why?

263
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,210
It's because you've grown up.

264
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,000
You've grown up.

265
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,530
So have I.

266
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,350
We can't do everything like we did when we were young.

267
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:02,570
Do you get it?

268
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:03,750
No.

269
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,490
You...

270
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,530
I just don't understand.

271
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,150
Can't we hug each other when we're adults?

272
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,240
Stop it.

273
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:13,260
Just sleep.

274
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,510
Please wake me up tomorrow.

275
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,850
But you have an afternoon shift tomorrow, don't you?

276
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,550
Some people asked to switch shifts with me.

277
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,220
Park.

278
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:37,570
Huh?

279
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,310
Can I ask you something?

280
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,200
What?

281
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,240
Who are you closest to at work?

282
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,630
I'm close with everyone in my shift.

283
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,750
You're not particularly close to anyone?

284
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,340
Who do you want me to be close to?

285
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,070
A woman sitting on your motorcycle.

286
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,680
Why?

287
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,210
You want me to be close to her?

288
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,190
I just saw you on a motorcycle with her.

289
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,810
She doesn't have her own ride.

290
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,060
Do you want her to walk behind me?

291
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,230
I'm just jealous of you.

292
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,090
Why are you f*cking jealous of me?

293
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,880
You said rude words again.

294
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,490
I want you to speak nicely to me.

295
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,580
Why did you hit me?

296
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,240
It made my heart flutter.

297
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,800
What's wrong with you?

298
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:57,850
Just sleep.

299
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,360
The hair band that day was tying snacks.

300
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,740
What did you say?

301
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,360
The hair band on my wrist that day

302
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,320
was holding a snack.

303
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,770
I unwrapped it and ate it

304
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,230
without knowing whose snack it was.

305
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,030
So I kept it.

306
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,010
But that day,

307
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,760
Meen's hair band was torn.

308
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,570
So I gave it to her.

309
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,810
You don't need to worry.

310
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,880
I am closest to you.

311
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,250
Kana!

312
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,250
Huh?

313
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,400
What happened to you?

314
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm... okay.

315
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,440
But it looks like you're not okay.

316
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,120
I'm just bored.

317
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,890
My parents fight every day.

318
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:52,940
But forget about it.

319
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,450
I will get better soon.

320
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,990
Let's find something delicious to eat.

321
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,480
I will treat you.

322
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,610
I eat a lot.

323
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,850
I can treat you for the rest of my life.

324
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,380
Let's go.

325
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,990
Just hurry up, eat and get going.

326
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,750
I have to go to work.

327
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,130
The rest of your life?

328
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:28,920
Yeah.

329
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,560
Tin, are you okay?

330
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:37,450
Are you sick?

331
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:39,920
I need to poop.

332
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:40,340
Huh?

333
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,050
I need to poop.

334
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:44,420
Huh?

335
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:45,620
Just go to the bathroom.

336
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,040
Lower your voice!

337
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,190
Tin.

338
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,090
You wanna poop?

339
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,350
Just go to the bathroom.

340
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:51,740
It's okay.

341
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,410
I can put up with it.

342
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,610
Class will end soon.

343
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,960
A little time can make you poop.

344
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,110
Why do you have to speak loudly?

345
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:59,280
I can deal with it.

346
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:03,410
Okay.

347
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,880
That's enough for today.

348
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,870
See you next class.

349
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,740
Show respect to our teachers.

350
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,750
Thank you.

351
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,290
Tin.

352
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,150
Where are you going?

353
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,170
I'm going to the bathroom.

354
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,490
Oh, Tin!

355
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,010
I just finished class.

356
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:22,810
I have somewhere to go.

357
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:23,940
Let's talk later.

358
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,370
Hold on, Tin.

359
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:26,690
Are you avoiding me?

360
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,140
No.

361
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,520
Where are you avoiding me?

362
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:31,290
Uh...

363
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:32,930
I...

364
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,960
I can't stand it any longer!

365
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,360
This is my art.

366
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:44,980
Really?

367
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,380
Hey, it's so beautiful.

368
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,710
Hello, Plearn.

369
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,170
Why are you so handsome today, Plearn?

370
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,170
You spoke so well today.

371
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,410
Hello, Plearn.

372
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,230
How are you?
Did you go to the bathroom in time?

373
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,180
Of course.

374
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,560
You should rush to the bathroom if you need to.

375
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,610
You shouldn't wait.

376
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,500
Can we stop talking about it?

377
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,500
I'm so embarrassed.

378
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:11,590
Why are you embarrassed?

379
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,550
You're cute, Tin.

380
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,490
You're being yourself.

381
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:20,870
But what are you doing here?

382
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:22,820
Oh.

383
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,760
I just passed around here by coincidence.

384
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:28,330
Oh, coincidentaly.

385
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,400
And met Tin by coincidence.

386
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,490
And bought us a drink by coincidence.

387
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,010
Oh.

388
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,290
Is it this coincidental, Plearn?

389
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:39,010
Oh.

390
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,460
I bought you all drinks.

391
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,310
Oh.

392
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:41,980
Orange juice.

393
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:42,730
Here.

394
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,190
Please take it.

395
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:45,380
Here.

396
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,500
This is your favorite orange juice.

397
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,240
Hey.

398
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,140
And I have the intention to come to you.

399
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,900
Why did you come to see me?

400
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:01,780
I...

401
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,450
was just missing you.

402
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,290
Oh.

403
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,520
Don't you miss me, Plearn?

404
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,470
I missed all of you,
so I bought you some drinks.

405
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,920
Oh.

406
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:20,790
Oh.

407
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:23,530
Can you carry it?

408
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,390
You're so tiny.

409
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,870
Of course.

410
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,490
I can even carry 10 of them.

411
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,420
Just one is enough.

412
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,440
Why are they placed so close to each other?

413
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,260
Calm down, my heart.

414
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,860
He's very cute, but you need to calm down.

415
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,360
You can put it here.

416
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:19,570
Okay.

417
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:20,320
Right here?

418
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,260
Yes.

419
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,880
Is this your art?

420
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:35,880
Yes.

421
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,640
It's awesome.
(D is slang for awesome)

422
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:40,840
Is it awesome?

423
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,310
It's an A grade!

424
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:49,410
When will you do Thai art work?

425
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,000
I want to help you.

426
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,400
I feel considerate of you.

427
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:58,200
Besides, if you help me,
it looks like I'm a cheater.

428
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,480
Is it like cheating?

429
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,230
I'm just helping you look,
but not helping you do it.

430
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,760
But I feel considerate of you no matter what.

431
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,820
I will do it by myself.

432
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,920
I probably won't have an excuse to see you then, right?

433
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,000
Yes?

434
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:17,260
I have no excuse to meet you.

435
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,300
What should I do?

436
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:22,200
I'm embarrassed when you say that.

437
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,820
Have you thought about the major you will study?

438
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,080
I'm still deciding.

439
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:40,930
I think you should choose what you are good at.

440
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,060
I don't really like what I'm good at.

441
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:51,380
What I like, I can't do very well.

442
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:55,080
I think you're good at everything.

443
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,910
Thank you.

444
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,440
Hey, guys.

445
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,740
Which major did you choose?

446
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:14,530
I haven't decided yet.

447
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,080
Sculpture only!

448
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,080
Art?

449
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,480
Yeah.

450
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,640
What about you? Tin.

451
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,820
It's raining today, isn't it?

452
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,070
It's so bad.

453
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,770
You changed the topic very badly.

454
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,210
I don't know where his head's at.

455
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,090
I know it isn't here.

456
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,600
What?

457
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:41,880
How is your relationship with Plearn?

458
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,040
How is it?

459
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,220
Nothing.

460
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,950
He is with you from dusk til dawn.

461
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,610
You should soften your heart to him.

462
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,690
The two of you stop now.

463
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,430
Stop it.

464
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,080
Don't be shy, we all know.

465
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:00,650
Heyy.

466
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:01,760
What?

467
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,760
You're blushing.

468
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,960
Stop it.

469
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:11,600
Oh, Tin.

470
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,010
Would you like me to drive you?

471
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,230
Yes?

472
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,880
You didn't bring an umbrella with you.

473
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,840
If you wait for the bus,
you might get wet in the rain.

474
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,880
May I drive you?

475
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,510
Can you drive me too?

476
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,270
Sure.

477
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,870
Oh, I'm about to ride in a mini car.

478
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,220
Please wait for me here.

479
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,030
I'll drive here.

480
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,850
He's so nice, can you endure it?

481
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,020
Sure.

482
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,090
My heart already has Park.

483
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:50,270
Park who doesn't have feelings for you?

484
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,350
Wow.

485
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,140
You talk too harshly!

486
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,990
Oh.

487
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,760
No, I just think Plearn is cute.

488
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,440
In case you have feelings for him a little bit.

489
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,180
Alright.

490
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,070
I'll go now.

491
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,650
I don't want to be a third wheel.

492
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,580
Bye bye.

493
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,410
Back home safely.

494
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,090
Huh?

495
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,690
Can I play music?

496
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:48,720
Sure.

497
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,170
I don't think this car has a music player.

498
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,650
I usually ride a motorcycle.

499
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,440
Then you can ride in my car more often.

500
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,070
I've been driving alone for a long time.

501
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,010
Do you listen to this kind of music too?

502
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:27,760
It's cute, isn't it?

503
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:33,770
Yes.

504
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,880
Do you skateboard too?

505
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,840
I skate with my friends.

506
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,930
I didn't think you were a skater.

507
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,020
Why?

508
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,500
It doesn't suit me?

509
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:58,230
I thought skateboarders would look more like rap fans.

510
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,270
Like swag.

511
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,400
But you are the opposite of them.

512
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,610
I don't think there's a skateboarding park around here.

513
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,010
It doesn't exist there.

514
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,550
Normally, we find a large courtyard to skate.

515
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:21,320
Otherwise, we used the road at night.

516
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,500
Do you wanna try?

517
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,710
I'm afraid I'm going to fall.

518
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,210
I don't have the courage to skate.

519
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,760
You have me, why are you still afraid?

520
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:36,980
I will teach you.

521
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:42,560
Let's skate together later.

522
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:47,390
Sure.

523
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,920
I will try it.

524
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,180
You promised me already?

525
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:55,730
If you are free, please tell me.
Let's skateboard together.

526
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:56,860
Okay?

527
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,460
Okay.

528
00:32:18,189 --> 00:32:18,807
Tin.

529
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,345
Have you thought about that yet?

530
00:32:29,345 --> 00:32:29,890
Yes?

531
00:32:31,978 --> 00:32:34,625
About me saying I like you.

532
00:32:36,436 --> 00:32:37,469
Plearn.

533
00:32:38,232 --> 00:32:41,018
Can I have a hopeful answer?

534
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:45,760
Just a little bit.

535
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:48,705
I...

536
00:32:57,956 --> 00:32:59,476
I...

537
00:33:04,269 --> 00:33:04,880
Hey.

538
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,807
I think I should go back first.

539
00:33:16,814 --> 00:33:18,305
See you later.

540
00:33:18,509 --> 00:33:19,112
Okay.

541
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:21,374
Tin.

542
00:33:22,763 --> 00:33:24,087
As for the answer,

543
00:33:25,221 --> 00:33:26,712
you can think about it slowly.

544
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,665
Go home safely.

545
00:33:53,345 --> 00:33:54,472
Why did he drive you?

546
00:33:56,007 --> 00:33:58,487
He just drove me home.

547
00:33:59,898 --> 00:34:00,967
Your face is very grim.

548
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,393
Hey, uncle Keng!

549
00:34:09,771 --> 00:34:10,760
Hey, naughty child.

550
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:13,720
Hello, dad.

551
00:34:15,029 --> 00:34:15,814
Please take it.

552
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:21,087
I really missed you.

553
00:34:21,494 --> 00:34:22,564
Hey, calm down.

554
00:34:22,709 --> 00:34:24,411
I am old. Calm down.

555
00:34:26,265 --> 00:34:26,644
Let's go.

556
00:34:27,051 --> 00:34:28,193
I have a present for you.

557
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:28,762
Really?

558
00:34:46,076 --> 00:34:46,716
Let me see.

559
00:34:47,094 --> 00:34:48,396
What did you buy me?

560
00:34:48,665 --> 00:34:50,054
There's a lot!

561
00:34:50,113 --> 00:34:51,262
You can check.

562
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:54,265
It has oranges that Park likes too!

563
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,909
Hey.

564
00:34:56,149 --> 00:35:00,571
Have you been taking good care of Park?

565
00:35:01,509 --> 00:35:02,353
Yes.

566
00:35:02,484 --> 00:35:03,858
I take good care of him.

567
00:35:05,254 --> 00:35:07,814
I must have some prizes for you.

568
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:09,473
What prizes?

569
00:35:12,222 --> 00:35:17,174
I won't forget that your birthday just passed.

570
00:35:19,044 --> 00:35:19,625
Here.

571
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:21,924
Unwrap it. What did I buy you?

572
00:35:22,884 --> 00:35:23,582
Do you like it?

573
00:35:29,691 --> 00:35:30,927
You like it, right?

574
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:32,472
Little painter.

575
00:35:38,425 --> 00:35:38,847
Why?

576
00:35:38,862 --> 00:35:39,560
But...

577
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:42,178
It's too expensive.

578
00:35:43,647 --> 00:35:44,724
I can't take it.

579
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,331
Why?

580
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:52,018
What should I do? I already bought it.

581
00:35:55,422 --> 00:35:57,633
I have no right to receive anything expensive from you.

582
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:02,040
I'm very considerate of you just
that I live in your house.

583
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:02,650
Stop.

584
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:04,505
You don't have to say anything, Tin.

585
00:36:05,662 --> 00:36:09,342
You are like one of my children or grandchildren.

586
00:36:10,884 --> 00:36:11,393
Here.

587
00:36:12,527 --> 00:36:13,582
Please take it.

588
00:36:14,462 --> 00:36:17,109
I really want to buy it for you.

589
00:36:20,949 --> 00:36:22,760
Park will complain to me for sure.

590
00:36:24,004 --> 00:36:25,967
Can I ask Park first?

591
00:36:26,796 --> 00:36:27,436
Okay.

592
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:28,471
Just ask him.

593
00:36:38,949 --> 00:36:39,502
Park!

594
00:36:40,229 --> 00:36:41,771
Uncle Keng bought it for me.

595
00:36:42,258 --> 00:36:43,327
Can I take it?

596
00:36:43,727 --> 00:36:44,884
Just return it to him.

597
00:36:45,167 --> 00:36:46,142
I'll buy it for you.

598
00:36:49,276 --> 00:36:50,462
Okay.

599
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,025
I don't have money to buy it.

600
00:36:54,193 --> 00:36:54,927
Just keep it.

601
00:36:55,785 --> 00:36:57,174
I wont take it anymore.

602
00:36:58,171 --> 00:36:59,116
It's okay.

603
00:36:59,516 --> 00:37:01,174
Just keep it if you want it.

604
00:37:01,916 --> 00:37:02,934
It's up to you.

605
00:37:05,996 --> 00:37:07,509
I really mean that.

606
00:37:08,207 --> 00:37:09,182
I'm not complaining to you.

607
00:37:10,214 --> 00:37:10,818
Really?

608
00:37:10,985 --> 00:37:11,640
Yes.

609
00:37:12,164 --> 00:37:13,058
Yay!

610
00:37:14,062 --> 00:37:15,284
I'll take it all!

611
00:37:15,313 --> 00:37:15,858
Yeah.

612
00:37:24,789 --> 00:37:26,644
How is it? What did he say?

613
00:37:28,127 --> 00:37:29,480
Thank you, uncle Keng.

614
00:37:30,091 --> 00:37:31,474
I will use it well.

615
00:37:33,414 --> 00:37:37,778
I'll give you double the money back
if I'm already working.

616
00:37:38,105 --> 00:37:38,934
No, no!

617
00:37:39,516 --> 00:37:40,338
3 times!

618
00:37:41,327 --> 00:37:41,953
No, no!

619
00:37:42,018 --> 00:37:42,731
10 times!

620
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,974
You are very generous.

621
00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:52,076
What you do for me is worth
10 times the amount it cost.

622
00:37:52,614 --> 00:37:54,171
It's okay.

623
00:37:54,287 --> 00:37:56,644
I didn't think of taking it back.

624
00:37:58,011 --> 00:37:59,902
I'm going back today.

625
00:38:00,331 --> 00:38:04,658
Please bring souvenirs to the neighbors.

626
00:38:05,233 --> 00:38:06,622
You can trust me.

627
00:38:07,356 --> 00:38:12,382
Please take good care of Park.

628
00:38:13,436 --> 00:38:14,076
Sure!

629
00:38:21,502 --> 00:38:22,164
Let me hug you.

630
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:24,774
I have to go now.

631
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:25,524
Okay.

632
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,175
I'll take care of Park for you.

633
00:38:54,473 --> 00:38:55,273
Park!

634
00:38:55,659 --> 00:38:57,731
You should come down and talk to Uncle Keng.

635
00:39:00,459 --> 00:39:02,182
I don't know what to talk to him about.

636
00:39:02,677 --> 00:39:06,015
But Uncle Keng wants to know a lot about you.

637
00:39:06,626 --> 00:39:08,422
You told him everything, didn't you?

638
00:39:09,455 --> 00:39:12,473
But you've been avoiding him for a long time.

639
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:15,731
I'm not close to him.

640
00:39:16,284 --> 00:39:18,124
But Uncle Keng is your father.

641
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:20,888
Even I can be close to Uncle Keng.

642
00:39:21,448 --> 00:39:23,484
I see that you are close to everyone's father.

643
00:39:24,379 --> 00:39:26,117
It's because I don't have a father.

644
00:39:33,142 --> 00:39:33,971
Park.

645
00:39:39,608 --> 00:39:40,233
I...

646
00:39:41,135 --> 00:39:42,473
am the one who caused your father's death.
