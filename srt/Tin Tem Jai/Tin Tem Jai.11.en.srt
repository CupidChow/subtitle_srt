(Tin Tem Jai)
(Episode 11)

2
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,880
It's done, Pao.

3
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,800
I'm very hungry.

4
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,360
I will serve it to them myself.

5
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,640
It looks delicious.

6
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,600
Your dish is ready.

7
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,640
Thank you, Pao.

8
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,280
Yeah.

9
00:01:52,072 --> 00:01:52,712
It's delicious.

10
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,520
Pao, I'd like some dishes.

11
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,000
Sure.

12
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,080
Dad.

13
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,040
What? Pao.

14
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,160
Bie wanted the same dish she ordered.

15
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,000
Sure.

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,920
What happened to you, Bie?

17
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,360
Why do you look tired?

18
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,015
I didn't sleep last night.

19
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,280
I've been preparing parcels all night.

20
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,480
I can help you.

21
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,800
It's done.

22
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,000
The postal truck just picked
up the parcels just now.

23
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,320
Hey, let me sit with you guys.

24
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:25,160
Hey.

25
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,240
Get up.

26
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,840
What?

27
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,640
Get up. I'll sit here.

28
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,160
Just sit somewhere else.

29
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,640
Get up.

30
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,640
- Why didn't you pick up another chair?
- I am the restaurant owner.

31
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,960
Hey, just give it to me.

32
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,960
It looks delicious.

33
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,520
What wind blew you together here?

34
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,760
Perfect timing.

35
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,800
Why?

36
00:02:48,528 --> 00:02:51,888
I got free concert tickets.

37
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,200
Oh!

38
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,160
What band are they, sis?

39
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,480
An artist named Minty.

40
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,600
She is a regular customer of my salon.

41
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,600
So she gave me concert tickets.

42
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,080
Is anyone interested?

43
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,160
Oh!

44
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,760
I really like this band.

45
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,160
I normally only like Korean artists.

46
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,520
But she is the first Thai
artist that I really like.

47
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,160
I want to scream again.

48
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,640
Let me see your ticket.

49
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,440
Who are they?

50
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,400
I don't know them.

51
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,120
They don't know you either.

52
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:26,960
Yes.

53
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,160
I think we should all go together.

54
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,840
Just think of it as our Bangkok trip.

55
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,840
Yay!

56
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,680
Can I see that ticket?

57
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,240
I haven't been to Bangkok yet.

58
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,320
- Park, let's go there.
- I want to go with you.

59
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,840
Hey, how about my food?

60
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,480
You haven't ordered it yet.

61
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,600
Oh...

62
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,880
Look at this, Park.

63
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,880
Pai.

64
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:55,960
Hey.

65
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,200
Pai, Pao, Park.

66
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,120
Please take good care of them.

67
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,960
There's a lot of thieves there.

68
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,960
Don't worry, dad.

69
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,360
Bangkok is my area.

70
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,360
Alright.

71
00:04:08,671 --> 00:04:10,231
I think you guys
should head out now.

72
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,920
Otherwise, you'll get there late.

73
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,760
Drive carefully.

74
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,080
Have a safe trip.

75
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,840
Don't let the bike overtake you.

76
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,520
Sure.

77
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,680
- Good bye.
- Good luck.

78
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,440
Have a nice trip.

79
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,440
Yeah. Good bye.

80
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,480
Bye.

81
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,520
It's good that they don't have
to ride each other's necks.

82
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,040
Bye bye.

83
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,320
Crispy pork rice, please.

84
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,080
Crispy pork rice.

85
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,200
Crispy pork rice. Okay.

86
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,760
I'll cook it for you.

87
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,920
Oh, so cute.

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,480
Let me hold you.

89
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,360
Oh.

90
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,240
Hey, you guys.

91
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,880
Is that Pai's salon?

92
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,760
Huh?

93
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,080
What? No one answered me.

94
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,840
Let's go inside.

95
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,240
Go!

96
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,040
Wow!

97
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,680
Pai's room is huge.

98
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,800
Not that much, it's just an ordinary room.

99
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,440
Hey.

100
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,880
The sofa is mine!

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,040
I can't believe that Pai is rich
enough to buy a room this big.

102
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,120
Kana!

103
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,800
Huh?

104
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,000
Be careful with your words.

105
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,160
Do you know what you say is racist?

106
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,840
You're so bad.

107
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,560
You're so bad.

108
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,400
Why didn't you ever tell
about it to your family?

109
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,920
No one asked me.

110
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,760
I just want my family to
accept me for who I am.

111
00:06:18,976 --> 00:06:21,336
Not to love me because I'm successful.

112
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,880
So you let dad and mom misunderstand?

113
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,080
Forget about it.

114
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,640
It's in the past.

115
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,360
I'll bring you some water.

116
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,880
I'll bring you some water.

117
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,480
Umm.

118
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,920
The mall is so big.

119
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,160
Hurry up.

120
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,040
How was it?

121
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,680
Guys.

122
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,520
I think I'll go to my salon first.

123
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,120
I'm going to talk to them
about selling the business.

124
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,480
Huh?

125
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,360
You said you wouldn't
sell it at first, didn't you?

126
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,640
I seriously think I'm going back home.

127
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,840
So I'm thinking of
selling it to fund my salon.

128
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,880
Let's talk later after I
finish talking business.

129
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:17,960
Okay.

130
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,560
Go! Let's go inside.

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,480
Pai is good at everything.
Do you think so, Park?

132
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:23,960
Yeah.

133
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,160
She seems successful
in everything she does.

134
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,720
Everyone can be successful.

135
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,600
Just having effort and
determination is enough.

136
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,160
And just set a goal and focus on doing it.

137
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,200
I understand what you are saying.

138
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,280
Because we've already talked about this.

139
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,640
And not everyone can
do what they expect.

140
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,520
Because each person
has a different path in life.

141
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,120
Even I don't have that much money.

142
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,440
How can I beat the rich?

143
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,280
You don't remember?

144
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,960
I already told you not to worry about it.

145
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,120
Why do you think I won't be
able to take care of my boyfriend?

146
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,960
Don't worry about money.

147
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,720
I will work and take care of you.

148
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,800
I remember it.

149
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,360
But I'm making you feel obligated.

150
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,480
I'm worried people will think
I'm dating you for money.

151
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,880
Don't worry about it.

152
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:29,880
Let's go.

153
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,480
Wow.

154
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,640
Bangkok is very big, isn't it?

155
00:08:44,727 --> 00:08:47,047
It's like a different world
from the province we live in.

156
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,480
Just like that.

157
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,640
It's normal.

158
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,880
I think it's not normal.

159
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,840
I would like to have
prosperity in our province.

160
00:08:58,056 --> 00:08:59,616
Not just the cities being rich.

161
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,160
Oh.

162
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,760
I think you must work in Bangkok.

163
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,440
It would be easier for you.

164
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,840
I just want to live in my hometown.

165
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,280
I want to work in my hometown.

166
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,800
I don't want to be here.

167
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,240
Why?

168
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,120
I just want to be with you.

169
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,000
And our gang.

170
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,440
What are you thinking?

171
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,640
It's true.

172
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,520
If you really worked in Bangkok,

173
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,680
I would be lonely.

174
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,440
Let's go.

175
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,600
Let's find a place.

176
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,240
Huh?

177
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,680
Take a photo.

178
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,960
Oh.

179
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,760
Take a photo?

180
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,680
What do you think?

181
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,560
Well.

182
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,640
Take a photo.

183
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
You really don't want
to go anywhere, do you?

184
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,440
You have come to Bangkok.

185
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,040
I don't know.

186
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,440
I'll wait for Pai to finish her work.

187
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,360
Well.

188
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,520
Park.

189
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,960
He is Kim. My friend.

190
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,120
And...

191
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,680
He's Park. My neighborhood friend.

192
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,400
This is Tin and Barbie.

193
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,480
They are my neighborhood friends as well.

194
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:57,960
Yes.

195
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,440
Tin is so cute.

196
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,360
Feel free to tell me
where you want to travel.

197
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,800
I'll be your guide.

198
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,640
Well.

199
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,360
Great.

200
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,680
Currently I manage business in Bangkok.

201
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,240
I may not have free time.

202
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,240
Please take them to hang out if I'm busy.

203
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:14,720
Okay?

204
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,680
Sure.

205
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,720
I'm willing.

206
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,480
Yeah.

207
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,960
So can I have your Line?

208
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,200
In case we need to talk.

209
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,360
Okay.

210
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,800
Where do you want to travel?

211
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,280
I need to discuss with Park.

212
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,600
He's so cute.

213
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,120
Calm down.

214
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,200
Ahem.

215
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,480
Where are we going to travel tomorrow?

216
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,240
I'm okay with everything.

217
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,280
I want to go with Tin, just two people.

218
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,360
You guys are going on dates, right?

219
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,720
What about the rest of you?

220
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,640
I have no problem.

221
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,680
So don't complain to
me if I schedule a trip.

222
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,960
Ouch!

223
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,320
I will travel by myself.

224
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,920
So I'm going to travel with Pao.

225
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,320
Okay.

226
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,760
Then we will go on our own trip.

227
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,920
But you guys go together as a couple.

228
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,840
I'm going with Pai.

229
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,240
I'm lonely if I travel alone.

230
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,800
You guys travel together as a couple.

231
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,120
In the end, there were
only the two of us left.

232
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,960
Yes, sis.

233
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,160
Bie.

234
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,800
What would you like to eat?

235
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,080
I will treat you.

236
00:15:15,024 --> 00:15:20,184
As a single woman,
very beautiful and rich.

237
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,800
That one.

238
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:25,960
Deal.

239
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,600
Let's go.

240
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,400
Are you hungry?

241
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,600
Just a little bit.

242
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,200
But each restaurant
is expensive.

243
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,720
Hey, it's okay.

244
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,520
It's only once in a while.

245
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,080
I will treat you.

246
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:49,920
Well.

247
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,040
If I really want to eat
something, I'll tell you.

248
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,600
I am not hungry yet.

249
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:55,880
Okay.

250
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,960
Just tell me if you're hungry.

251
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,440
Or just tell me if you need anything.

252
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,200
I want to buy time

253
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,320
so you can rest a lot.

254
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,520
You're delirious.

255
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,240
It's true.

256
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,080
You have to work

257
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,640
even on holidays.

258
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,240
I see you work a lot.

259
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,200
So I want you to get some rest.

260
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,920
I am worried about you.

261
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,200
Hey.

262
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,160
Just having you by my side,

263
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,800
it relieves my tiredness.

264
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,960
Have you eaten anything strange?

265
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,320
You look weird.

266
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,400
Hey.

267
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,560
Please try to spin it.

268
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,640
Hey, it's really dizzying.

269
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,960
Sit here.

270
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,680
Why did you bring me here?

271
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,480
I just want to take you to
a place with less people.

272
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,680
You want to date me, right?

273
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,200
You're ridiculous.

274
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,440
Don't be stubborn.

275
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,680
Just honestly tell me your feelings.

276
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,760
It's not difficult.

277
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,040
Why don't you do it
since it's not difficult?

278
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:36,840
Park!

279
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,040
People will look at us.

280
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,320
Who will see us?

281
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,040
Nobody knows us.

282
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:10,800
Hey.

283
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,040
I'm hungry now.

284
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,280
Again?

285
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,240
I'm really hungry.

286
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,680
Let's eat.

287
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,760
Can I take one more photo?

288
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,840
Just one more photo.

289
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,200
Then you take a picture alone,
I'll take a picture for you.

290
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,240
Alright.

291
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,440
Please shoot well.

292
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,200
How should I pose?

293
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,480
Did it come out well?

294
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,120
1,2,3!

295
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,520
Great.

296
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,680
Here.

297
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,880
Well, let's eat.

298
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,520
Let's go. I'm hungry.

299
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,760
My pants will fall off.

300
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,200
My pants will fall off.

301
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,680
Let's go.
My pants will fall off.

302
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:54,880
Hey.

303
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,280
Huh?
Let's come up here.

304
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,560
- We can't!
- We can! Come up here.

305
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,800
The security guard will scold us!

306
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,920
Come up here!

307
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,600
Just for a moment, he doesn't know.

308
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,080
Let's walk on each side.

309
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,840
Can we hold hands?

310
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,551
- Why are your arms short?
- It's you with short arms.

311
00:19:13,575 --> 00:19:14,600
Well, let's try it again.

312
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,760
I'm about to fall.

313
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,520
I can't.

314
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,760
Wow, it's so beautiful.

315
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,240
Wow, look at this.

316
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,160
Look behind here.

317
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,560
Yes.

318
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,720
I want every day to
be like this, don't you?

319
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,560
Yeah.

320
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,600
Are you hot?

321
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,400
No.

322
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,720
Just jump in if you're hot.

323
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,920
I'm just asking if you're hot.

324
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,680
In case you want me to help.

325
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,480
The mall is very big, don't you think?

326
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,480
Yeah, I don't know where to go.

327
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,840
Hey!

328
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,200
Let's take a photobooth together.

329
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,080
Huh?

330
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,800
Photobooth, don't you know it?

331
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,240
I don't want it.

332
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,120
We can use mobile phones to take pictures.
No, it's more fun.

333
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,920
- It's more fun.
- It's free to use your phone to take pictures.

334
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,040
Come here.

335
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,320
Come on.

336
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,960
Let's choose this one.

337
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,160
Up to you.

338
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:17,880
This one!

339
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,840
It's coming.
Bow down!

340
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,040
- The camera is here.
- Are you ready? - Yes.

341
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,360
Hey!

342
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,800
What is that?

343
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,920
Please control your
expression. My face was stunned.

344
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,920
Okay, let's concentrate on this time.

345
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,600
Hey, it's better.

346
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,160
It's better.
Okay.

347
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,600
Stand behind me.

348
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,480
Hurry up!

349
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,160
It's almost good.
There are two more shots left.

350
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,400
Hey.

351
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,160
The last one.
I'll be on this side.

352
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,400
Okay.

353
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,080
1,2, keep your head down!

354
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,640
Hey.

355
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,640
Okay.

356
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,120
Done!

357
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,120
How was it?

358
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,520
It's cute, isn't it?

359
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,520
Yeah.

360
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,040
Hey.

361
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,760
Is it cute?

362
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,200
Well, it's cute.

363
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,600
My face was stunned.

364
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,240
Let's go.

365
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,280
Let's find something else to do.

366
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,520
Hurry up.

367
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,320
Park, please take a picture for me.

368
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:49,920
Okay.

369
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:51,720
Here.

370
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,280
Wait a moment.

371
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,680
Smile.

372
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,400
1,2,3!

373
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,960
Okay.

374
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,680
One more picture.

375
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,360
Cutie.

376
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,440
Did it come out well?

377
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,200
Check it out.

378
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,560
Oh, Tin.

379
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,080
Oh? Kim.

380
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,440
Why are you here?

381
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,080
I'm going to do something near here.

382
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,840
I didn't think I'd meet you here.

383
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,120
It's such a coincidence.

384
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,680
Yes.

385
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,600
It's a coincidence.

386
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,920
Only the two of you came together?

387
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,760
Yes.

388
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,360
Yes.

389
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,600
We're on a date, right?

390
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,320
Oh.

391
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,080
Yeah.

392
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,160
Then, I have to go now.

393
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,360
See you again, Tin.

394
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,480
Park.

395
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,600
What happened to you?

396
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,560
I don't like him.

397
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,920
You mean Kim?

398
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,720
Yeah.

399
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,320
But I didn't do anything.

400
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,720
He didn't do anything either.

401
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,200
Don't you know what his
intent was to approach you?

402
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,560
He just probably thought
that I was Pai's friend.

403
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,800
Men can see men's intentions.

404
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,720
He deliberately wants to flirt with you.

405
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,680
Alright.

406
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,200
I'm not leaving you anywhere.

407
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,080
I'm glad you're jealous of me.

408
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,160
I have already told you

409
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,000
that I will be so jealous
that others will burn.

410
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,760
Why are you smiling?

411
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,440
Please be jealous of me often.

412
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,080
Please be jealous of me often.

413
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,720
Yeah.

414
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,520
Park.

415
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,080
Huh?

416
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,800
Aren't you bored?
You've been sitting here for a long time.

417
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,800
No.

418
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,440
It's been a long time since I've
been with you, just the two of us.

419
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,080
Without being busy with work

420
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,280
or being wary of other people's eyes.

421
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,160
But I'm bored.

422
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,280
So what do you want to do?

423
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,480
If you are curious,

424
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,960
just go back to our room.

425
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,800
You're a bad kid.

426
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,640
Damn.

427
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,160
What are you going to do?

428
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,240
You still have to ask me?

429
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,960
Next time

430
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,960
just tell me honestly.

431
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,080
Who?

432
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,600
Bie.
Forget it.

433
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,400
Who is that?

434
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,680
Pai.

435
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,280
I come to this restaurant regularly.

436
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,000
Do we have to wait for them?

437
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,480
Just wait a minute.

438
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,160
I'm hungry.

439
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,960
I have sent them a message.

440
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,120
Look at the crispy pork here.

441
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,320
The meat was very juicy.

442
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,680
You'll love it.

443
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,880
Wow...

444
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,680
Wow!

445
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,880
You guys are so late.

446
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,280
Don't be angry, sis.

447
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,320
Yes, you don't answer my calls.

448
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,840
We were just watching movies.

449
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,480
But I saw Pai's message and came here.

450
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,240
Today Kim, my friend will
come to have dinner with us.

451
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,440
Hey, Pai.

452
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,440
Have you arrived?

453
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,080
Hello.

454
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,720
Hello.

455
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,480
This is Kim, he's my friend.

456
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,920
Oh.

457
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,400
Hey?

458
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:18,760
Hmm?

459
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,960
I forgot!

460
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:21,800
Huh?

461
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,680
What did you forget? Pao.

462
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,680
I forgot to go to the bathroom.

463
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,560
Sis, where is the bathroom?

464
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,240
Walk straight there.

465
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,520
- You can eat first.
- Just eat them. - Well, just go.

466
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,080
He seems to be taking a long time.

467
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,200
Sit here.

468
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,520
Yeah.

469
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,840
This restaurant is delicious, isn't it?

470
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,720
Which dish would you like to eat?
I'll pick it up for you.

471
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,800
It's okay.
I'll do it myself.

472
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,400
Okay.

473
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,720
Or do you want juice?
I'll order it for you.

474
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,400
It's okay.

475
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,600
I can drink soda.

476
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,320
Okay.

477
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,040
Do you want something to eat, Kana?

478
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,040
I'll pick it up for you.

479
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,720
I want chicken.

480
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,240
The food in this
restaurant is very delicious.

481
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,200
Right?

482
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,120
Thank you.

483
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,600
Here, Tin.

484
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,280
This is my regular restaurant and Pai.

485
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,680
It's very delicious. Try it.

486
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,360
Is it delicious?

487
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:30,960
Tin.

488
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,360
How do you eat to
mess it up like that?

489
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,320
Come on.

490
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,160
I'll wipe it for you.

491
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,800
Excuse me.

492
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,240
Thank you.

493
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,320
You eat like a kid.

494
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,600
I have to go somewhere.

495
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,240
Park.

496
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:58,760
Wow...

497
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,120
Park seems to be jealous.

498
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,760
If you want something
else, let me know.

499
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,400
Anyone want to order something more?

500
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,520
Hey!

501
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,320
Hey, I forgot to do something at the shop.

502
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,840
- I have to go now.
- Okay.

503
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,480
Then I have to go now.

504
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,600
Excuse me.

505
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,000
See you.

506
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,160
Chicken is mellow, Kana.

507
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,480
Yes.

508
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,280
Pai.

509
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:33,840
Oh.

510
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,960
What's up, darling?

511
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,880
I'm sorry for being rude to your friend.

512
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,560
Ouch!

513
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,600
Don't worry.

514
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,320
I know his personality well.

515
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,720
I know what he would do if he saw Tin.

516
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,680
I already told him that Tin
already has a boyfriend.

517
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,280
But it's good that you do that.

518
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,840
So that he could realize it.

519
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,440
Yes.

520
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,200
If you hadn't done that,
Tin would have been wooed.

521
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,280
Humans need some development.

522
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,920
Just sit there.

523
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:18,720
Yeah.

524
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:28,520
Is it delicious?
