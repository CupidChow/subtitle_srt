00:01:29,292 --> 00:01:34,792
(Tin Tem Jai)
(Episode 2)

2
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,210
Is he asleep?

3
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,200
(Yoshi Rinrada Thurapan
playing the role of Pai)

4
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,260
Honey~.

5
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,030
Please open the door.

6
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,040
Tin.

7
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,550
Park!

8
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:06,800
Tin!

9
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,380
What's wrong with these guys?

10
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,050
Are their phones just decoration?

11
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,680
Park!

12
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,730
Please open the door.

13
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,530
What are they doing?

14
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,120
Pai!

15
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,590
Yeah, it's me.

16
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,590
You're so late.

17
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,090
Huh?

18
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,840
When did you arrive?

19
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,930
After answering Bie's call,
I immediately drove from Bangkok.

20
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,870
Have you visited the hospital yet?

21
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,030
No.

22
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,200
Dad says they're not open
for patient visits right now.

23
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,200
I might go there in the morning.

24
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,180
So you didn't come into the house?

25
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,150
I don't have a house key.

26
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,760
You don't have a house key?

27
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,720
I've been kicked out of the house for a long time.

28
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,720
Let me stay here tonight.

29
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,310
Okay.

30
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:09,380
Won't you invite me into your house?

31
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,050
I'm dying from mosquito bites.

32
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,540
I'll help you.

33
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,440
Thank you, Tin.

34
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,290
Have you gotten taller?

35
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,580
I'm 2 cm taller.

36
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,190
Wow.

37
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,350
Did Dad take good care of you
since your mom wasn't here?

38
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,780
Umm...

39
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,310
Huh?

40
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,270
Why wont you answer me?

41
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,450
Where am I sleeping tonight?

42
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,860
With me.

43
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:51,720
Hey.

44
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,310
I can't.

45
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,910
I am a woman, Park.

46
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,200
You've been a woman for a long time, haven't you?

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,620
We've shared a bed since we
were 5 years old, what's wrong?

48
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,950
But now it's not the same.

49
00:04:03,061 --> 00:04:04,931
I'm a grown woman now.

50
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,550
Just sleep with your child.

51
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,400
My child has grown up to be a young man.

52
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,480
I don't want to.

53
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,960
Then I'll sleep in Tin's room.

54
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,960
And Tin sleeps with you.

55
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,190
Sure!

56
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,870
You don't need time to think?

57
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,400
I love you, Mom.

58
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:35,152
I've been wanting to sleep with Dad for a long time.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,560
Calm down, boy.

60
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,690
Ouch! It hurts.

61
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,660
He deserves to be your son.

62
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,300
Well, just a little bit.

63
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:00,560
Why?

64
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,090
I'll kick you.

65
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,640
You two...

66
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,280
How many days will you stay here?

67
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:31,031
I think I'll stay here
until Dad gets better

68
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,410
I've really wanted to come back.

69
00:05:34,663 --> 00:05:36,453
Why don't you stay here?

70
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,370
I want you back here.

71
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,630
I like you more than Park.

72
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,640
Do you love me more? Baby?

73
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,860
Because you're rich, Pai.

74
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,410
I can easily trick you into buying snacks.

75
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,540
Trick me into buying snacks easily?

76
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,280
Your Dad teach you to say this?

77
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,530
It hurts.

78
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,960
Just kidding.

79
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,490
But I'm honestly saying I want you back here.

80
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,000
I want to come back here.

81
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,010
But I'm worried that Mom
and Dad are embarrassed.

82
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,272
You don't remember?

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,810
People even laughed at me
eating ice-cream with Park.

84
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,920
But people here have already accepted you.

85
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,540
Accepted me?

86
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,520
I think it's because they
can't do anything else.

87
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:37,940
But uncles and aunts said that you can be
anything, just that you are a good person.

88
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,030
Good person?

89
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,210
It hurts because of this.

90
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,390
Why?

91
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,280
I don't get it.

92
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,390
Why does being gay mean
you need to be a good person?

93
00:06:56,135 --> 00:06:58,680
I can't make the mistake
of doing bad things.

94
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:04,610
If I make one mistake,
people will jump on it and take me down.

95
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,180
Because I'm different from them.

96
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,360
In addition to being a good person,
I have to be talented.

97
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,610
I left home with just my body
and I had to come back with success

98
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,810
to make my Mom and Dad accept me.

99
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,660
I have to be both a
good person and talented.

100
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,150
I have to do that all my life.

101
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,570
If I can't be both, my
life would be worthless.

102
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,940
You can cry sometimes.

103
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,940
Don't touch me.

104
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,220
I'll cry.

105
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,760
You can cry even when you are an adult.

106
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,580
I know.

107
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,350
Just go to bed.

108
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,090
Hey!

109
00:08:23,351 --> 00:08:24,631
What are you doing?

110
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,400
I'm going to take a shower.

111
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,710
Why did you take off your dress?

112
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,900
Crazy. You wear a dress to take a shower?

113
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,150
You should wait for me to leave
and take off your dress later.

114
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:40,160
You pretend to close your eyes.

115
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,830
You looked at me just now.

116
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,880
I didn't mean to look at you.

117
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,990
You suddenly took off your dress.

118
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,900
Do you want to touch or want to have it?

119
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,740
Huh!?

120
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:58,620
I mean, do I want to have it like me
or do you want to touch it?

121
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,830
Neither!

122
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,380
Why does it take so long to get things to my room?

123
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,610
You act like you're moving house.

124
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,730
I won't let you enter the room if you're late.

125
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,350
F*ck!

126
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,960
What the hell are you doing?

127
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,630
You pretend to be shocked.

128
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,790
Hey, you saw it when you were a kid.

129
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,730
I've never seen that thing.

130
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,000
You haven't seen that thing?

131
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,250
You mean something new?

132
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,440
Would you like to see it?

133
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,410
Would you like to see it?
Would you like to see it?

134
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,090
No!

135
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,570
Wont you think of the child?

136
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,810
Both of you are weak.

137
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,920
Park, can you pull the zipper down for me?

138
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,270
Don’t bug me!

139
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,970
Just take a shower.

140
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,340
You can't even help me.

141
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,080
Ouch!

142
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,230
Are you teasing me?

143
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,050
I didn't mean to!

144
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,550
Ouch. My arm hurts.

145
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,720
Please pull the zipper down for me. Hurry up.

146
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,070
Why don't you do it yourself?

147
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,870
My arm hurts. My other arm has to...

148
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,120
hold the towel to keep it from slipping.

149
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,600
You...

150
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:11,890
My arm hurts.

151
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,180
The towel is slippery.
You all will see it if it gets dropped.

152
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,110
Tin, please help me.

153
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,460
Your dad didn't help me.

154
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,660
You...

155
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,560
Help me, please.

156
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,840
You only used one hand.

157
00:10:36,392 --> 00:10:37,212
You're an expert at it.

158
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:39,750
Bye.

159
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,390
Why?

160
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:47,870
Nothing!

161
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,300
Hurry up.

162
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,160
You're really slow.

163
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,780
I won't let you sleep with me if you're late.

164
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,920
Okay. I'll go now.

165
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,170
Where do you want me to sleep?

166
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,520
Anywhere.

167
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,910
So, can I sleep on your body?

168
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,740
Just sleep outside.

169
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,140
Hey, just kidding.

170
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,660
But if it's true, it would be good.

171
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,910
I'll kick you.

172
00:11:29,751 --> 00:11:31,048
You can sleep here.

173
00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:54,844
I told you not to sleep on high pillows.

174
00:11:55,653 --> 00:11:56,773
You don't have neck pain?

175
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,555
I just like it.

176
00:12:04,568 --> 00:12:06,097
Why do you put rags on my bed?

177
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,493
It's not a rag.

178
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,360
This is my old blanket.

179
00:12:12,195 --> 00:12:13,360
You haven't stopped using it yet?

180
00:12:14,293 --> 00:12:17,448
How do I stop using it?
I've been sleeping with it since I was a kid.

181
00:12:17,644 --> 00:12:19,751
I can't sleep without it.

182
00:12:20,337 --> 00:12:21,653
You're as big as a buffalo.

183
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,920
Everyone has their own dumb stuff.

184
00:12:28,728 --> 00:12:29,706
Or are you different?

185
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:35,484
I used to have it.

186
00:12:37,306 --> 00:12:37,786
Huh?

187
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,515
Where is it now?

188
00:12:44,156 --> 00:12:44,938
It's grown up.

189
00:12:45,555 --> 00:12:46,000
Huh?

190
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,960
It's you. You dumbass.

191
00:12:57,102 --> 00:13:00,311
I hugged you every day when I was a kid.

192
00:15:10,231 --> 00:15:13,546
Look, look, look. Look at your style.

193
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:17,644
Why are you already starting, Kana?

194
00:15:18,853 --> 00:15:20,222
Where are you going
dressed like that?

195
00:15:20,782 --> 00:15:22,000
On a date with a girl at college?

196
00:15:33,573 --> 00:15:35,484
What are you playing? It's noisy.

197
00:15:35,964 --> 00:15:37,480
Yes, I can't get it.

198
00:15:39,191 --> 00:15:39,928
What are you guys doing here?

199
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:42,140
If you don't want to buy anything, go back!

200
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,022
It's blocking the entrance!

201
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:45,404
A water, please.

202
00:15:46,657 --> 00:15:47,360
I don't sell it.

203
00:15:48,186 --> 00:15:49,768
What do you sell at your shop?

204
00:15:50,248 --> 00:15:51,155
I don't sell anything!

205
00:15:51,928 --> 00:15:52,755
Why?

206
00:15:52,862 --> 00:15:53,857
I'm closing the shop!

207
00:15:54,017 --> 00:15:54,480
Go back!

208
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,884
Okay. Up to you.

209
00:15:56,835 --> 00:15:57,400
I'll go now.

210
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,568
You haven't gone yet?

211
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,720
They always irritate me.

212
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:09,688
They irritate from a young age.

213
00:16:11,022 --> 00:16:12,124
Who are they like?

214
00:16:28,346 --> 00:16:29,964
Where have you been since morning?

215
00:16:32,106 --> 00:16:32,568
Ugh!

216
00:16:33,001 --> 00:16:33,952
Not this again!

217
00:16:34,435 --> 00:16:35,520
I'm going to college.

218
00:16:35,831 --> 00:16:37,520
I think you're going on a date with a girl.

219
00:16:38,328 --> 00:16:40,106
Why do you have to say the same as Kana?

220
00:16:41,546 --> 00:16:42,542
I'm mad at you.

221
00:16:46,231 --> 00:16:47,084
Let's eat?

222
00:16:49,813 --> 00:16:51,591
I'll treat you to a special crispy pork.

223
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:53,928
Really?

224
00:16:54,177 --> 00:16:55,102
Okay!

225
00:16:55,128 --> 00:16:55,742
Hurry up.

226
00:16:56,204 --> 00:16:57,173
Put on your shoes.

227
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:07,013
I'm here.

228
00:17:07,315 --> 00:17:07,751
Oh.

229
00:17:08,497 --> 00:17:09,697
Why you're so late?

230
00:17:09,777 --> 00:17:10,728
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

231
00:17:11,048 --> 00:17:12,364
I arrived at the same time.

232
00:17:12,728 --> 00:17:14,017
My heart calls for you.

233
00:17:15,297 --> 00:17:16,453
You're overacting.

234
00:17:17,128 --> 00:17:21,520
If my thoughts of you had legs,
they would run toward you every second, Donut.

235
00:17:23,004 --> 00:17:23,937
Isn't that too much?

236
00:17:24,097 --> 00:17:25,075
I'm serious.

237
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:29,262
Is your homework finished?

238
00:17:30,053 --> 00:17:31,280
The truth is you want a copy of my homework, right?

239
00:17:32,435 --> 00:17:33,280
No~.

240
00:17:33,911 --> 00:17:34,755
What do you actually want?

241
00:17:34,942 --> 00:17:35,733
Nothing!

242
00:17:36,631 --> 00:17:37,511
I really miss you.

243
00:17:37,706 --> 00:17:38,850
So you don't care about my homework, do you?

244
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:39,315
Oh...

245
00:17:40,044 --> 00:17:40,915
Just a copy of someone else's.

246
00:17:48,115 --> 00:17:49,351
Pai!

247
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:51,022
I want the same as usual.

248
00:17:51,475 --> 00:17:52,160
Me too.

249
00:17:52,657 --> 00:17:53,102
Okay.

250
00:17:59,635 --> 00:18:01,244
I'm going to pick up your dad.

251
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,520
Oh, it's time for dad to come back home?

252
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,022
Yes.

253
00:18:05,048 --> 00:18:06,240
I'll drive you.

254
00:18:07,351 --> 00:18:08,595
It's okay, sis.

255
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:10,142
I'll drive her myself.

256
00:18:11,564 --> 00:18:12,364
Just stay here.

257
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:13,208
Please?

258
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:17,626
Oh, you don't work in the morning?

259
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,620
Oh, I'm taking a break.

260
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:21,857
I want to pick up dad, so
he doesn't wait too long.

261
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:28,480
You are intelligent,
diligent, and grateful.

262
00:18:28,773 --> 00:18:31,280
You're really lucky, Tim.

263
00:18:31,305 --> 00:18:34,513
You have a good son, and he's a teacher!

264
00:18:35,537 --> 00:18:38,995
Pao never made his parents sad.

265
00:18:39,582 --> 00:18:42,791
If all of my kids were as good as Pao, I'd be happy.

266
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:48,124
Just stop here, mom. Let's go.

267
00:18:48,524 --> 00:18:49,626
Let's drive to pick up dad.

268
00:18:50,053 --> 00:18:50,817
He's been waiting.

269
00:18:52,346 --> 00:18:54,030
You can order what you want.

270
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,690
Sure. Thank you.

271
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:56,373
Bye.

272
00:18:56,462 --> 00:18:58,097
Let's see. What's on the menu today?

273
00:18:58,631 --> 00:19:00,106
What's on the menu today?

274
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:03,368
I would like to order crispy pork rice.

275
00:19:03,991 --> 00:19:05,208
You can wait at that table.

276
00:19:17,395 --> 00:19:18,320
Pai.

277
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:21,937
I'm okay.

278
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:23,057
I don't feel bad.

279
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,826
I'll give you a lot.

280
00:19:31,786 --> 00:19:32,462
All here.

281
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,817
I need more dipping sauce.

282
00:19:35,795 --> 00:19:36,810
You order a lot.

283
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:37,991
Just wait at your table.

284
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,920
Hold on. Four of you.

285
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,420
Please study hard like Tin.

286
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,800
Hey, teacher. Tin doesn't study that hard.

287
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,900
If he's calm like that,
he was definitely asleep.

288
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:11,760
Tin.

289
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,300
Tin.

290
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:15,195
Yes? Teacher, I'm almost done.

291
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,320
What do you mean? You
haven't done anything.

292
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,410
Daydreaming again?

293
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,990
Why are you so stressed out, Tin?

294
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,710
I don't know what I want to choose.

295
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:34,870
I think you have a talent for using oil paints.

296
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:39,960
Just start with what you like and
what you're good at if you you're lost.

297
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,400
Don't be stressed.

298
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,380
Thank you, teacher.

299
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,370
Guys.

300
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:02,810
This is the final work to
assess your knowledge and abilities

301
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,760
to see if the faculty you want to study is right for you.

302
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,790
Whoever can decide now,

303
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,820
please show your full determination.

304
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,320
Guys.

305
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,880
Today's class is over.

306
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,110
Don't forget my words.

307
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,250
There is no right or wrong in art.

308
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,420
It's your heart.

309
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,810
Guys, show respect to the teacher.

310
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,110
Thank you.

311
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,720
What happened? Why are you stressed all day?

312
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,260
There's something I need to think about.

313
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,920
I also don't know what faculty to choose.

314
00:21:50,537 --> 00:21:52,227
You are good at many things.

315
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,750
You are good at sculpting and good at watercolor.

316
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:56,130
You draw well. Or are you interested in Thai art?

317
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,330
Just like...

318
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,040
Hey!

319
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,190
It's a Thai art pattern.

320
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,490
Oh, really?

321
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,410
You always talk about something else, Kaew.

322
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,350
I just don't want him to get stressed out.

323
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,150
I don't know what I will choose.

324
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:14,060
Anyway, thank you.

325
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,070
Alright, don't think much about it.

326
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,680
I'm hungry now.

327
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,090
Let's go get something to eat.

328
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:19,610
Okay.

329
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,370
Go. Let's go?

330
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,780
Just enjoy it.

331
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,700
I have an appointment with my family.

332
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:31,010
You have Park and us left.

333
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:34,560
You must understand that between friends and Park,

334
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,610
Tin will always choose Park..

335
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,550
Everyone chooses their lover.

336
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,780
I envy you.

337
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,440
I'll go now.

338
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,070
Bye.

339
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,320
Let's go.

340
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,320
What do you want to eat?

341
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:05,590
What do you want to eat?

342
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,824
I'm okay with everything.
You can choose.

343
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,200
I'm fine with it all, as
long as you're next to me.

344
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,350
I'm bored of you guys.
There is no 'everything' option..

345
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,550
If you don't choose, don't eat. I'm annoyed.

346
00:23:17,804 --> 00:23:18,853
Don't be mad.

347
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,480
You can choose your favorite restaurant.

348
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:22,500
We will go with you.

349
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,640
I didn't get sulky. I'm just
annoyed with you guys.

350
00:23:24,825 --> 00:23:26,825
I'm like the air with you guys.

351
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,230
Watch out if I have a boyfriend.

352
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:31,440
Hey, do you need my help?

353
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:34,050
Stop. I'm comfortable when I'm alone.

354
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,250
Go. Let's eat.

355
00:23:36,492 --> 00:23:37,342
I'm so hungry.

356
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,480
Let's eat some sweets.

357
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:47,590
There's a crepe shop over there. Wow.

358
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,610
It's your favourite.

359
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,380
It's a crepe shop.

360
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,430
It has many flavors.

361
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,900
It has orange, strawberry, chocolate flavors.

362
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:59,100
Which flavor do you want? Pick!

363
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,790
Which flavor do you want?

364
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:01,980
Which flavor do you want?

365
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,820
- The strawberry one.
- Strawberry flavor.

366
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,900
- Strawberry flavors, please.
- Okay.

367
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,470
- Please wait a little bit.
- Okay.

368
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:08,740
Baby.

369
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,250
I'll go somewhere for a moment.

370
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,300
- I'll pick you up later.
- Yes, mom.

371
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,530
Don't go anywhere, please eat crepes
and wait for me here.

372
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:19,570
- Yes.
- Okay?

373
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,140
So cute.

374
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,280
- Hey.
- Yes?

375
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,190
- Please take care of my daughter for a moment.
- Okay.

376
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,480
I'll hurry back. Thank you.

377
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,810
Sit here.

378
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:35,960
- Please have crepes instead of me.
- Okay.

379
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:37,520
I'll hurry back.

380
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:51,800
Tin.

381
00:24:55,848 --> 00:24:56,848
Why are you here?

382
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,190
I came with my mom.

383
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,760
Where is your mom?

384
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,290
My mom went
somewhere else for a while.

385
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:06,480
Oh, then I'll go home now.

386
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,780
But I want to be with you. My mom is
busy with work these days. I am bored.

387
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,880
Please stay with me, Tin?

388
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,620
Would you like to eat crepes? I will treat you.

389
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,880
It's okay. My mom has ordered it.

390
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,810
What about the drinks?

391
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,200
I love it!

392
00:25:33,315 --> 00:25:34,275
Okay. Let's order it.

393
00:25:35,502 --> 00:25:37,208
- What should I order?
- What do you want to order?

394
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:39,080
I want...

395
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,720
Eat it all.

396
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,160
Tin, why haven't you gone home yet?

397
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:55,200
I'm going back, but where have you been?

398
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:59,160
I went to the market with Pao
to buy vegetables for grilled pork this evening.

399
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,890
- Manow, I will wait for my brother at my house.
- Yes.

400
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,600
Please take care of her.

401
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:11,610
I'll go now.

402
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,530
- Don't mess with her.
- Yeah, I'll take care of her.

403
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,500
Do you like it?

404
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,600
Yes. You're so kind.

405
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:37,510
Do you remember what you promised me?

406
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,710
Yes. I have to take good care of things.

407
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:44,078
Because you bought it for me.

408
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,554
Good girl.

409
00:26:46,488 --> 00:26:46,942
Well.

410
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,590
Huh? Park.

411
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,630
You haven't gone home?
Don't you have a family thing?

412
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,730
- Oh, it's true.
- Huh?

413
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,450
I have to go now.

414
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,480
What are you doing?

415
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,090
I'll go now.

416
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,520
- Bye, Park.
- Bye.

417
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:09,130
Okay, get back safely.

418
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,240
Let me see. How far have you colored?

419
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:15,890
Let me see.

420
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:31,150
Why hasn't Tin arrived yet?

421
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:33,510
Yes, did Tin forget about us?

422
00:27:33,742 --> 00:27:35,192
My legs are aching now.

423
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:41,210
Mike, why don't you take a seat?

424
00:27:43,145 --> 00:27:45,095
I'll sit with you.

425
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:05,260
Hey, Ton. You can sit. Your
walking makes me dizzy.

426
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,300
Yes, Ton. Please sit down.

427
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,960
Yea! Tin is here.

428
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,940
Hello.

429
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,660
Why are you late, Tin?

430
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,430
We were waiting to study art with you.

431
00:28:23,848 --> 00:28:28,035
Huh? Didn't I tell you guys
that there's no class today?

432
00:28:28,497 --> 00:28:29,620
I'm busy today.

433
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,750
You didn't tell us.

434
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,930
Oh? What about us?

435
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,750
Sorry, but head back home now.

436
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,740
I'll teach you another day.

437
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:55,330
Well, let's go watch cartoons at my house.

438
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,140
Let's go watch cartoons?

439
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,710
- So shall we go shopping?
- Let's go.

440
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,680
- You guys are going shopping, girls?
- Yes.

441
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,730
Huh? Hi, son.

442
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:27,982
How was your class?

443
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,786
It's fun.

444
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:30,906
Oh.

445
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,860
Hey!

446
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,150
I can't sit here?

447
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,060
Let's eat grilled pork together.
We're waiting for you.

448
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:45,110
What about Pao and Kana?

449
00:29:46,043 --> 00:29:48,753
Oh, they're washing
vegetables in the kitchen.

450
00:29:50,408 --> 00:29:52,920
They've been gone so long, maybe
they're planting vegetables too.

451
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:58,860
Put it here after it's washed.

452
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,880
Germs!

453
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:14,660
If you sneeze, please turn to the other side.

454
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,750
Your hands are dirtier than mine.

455
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,770
You touched my head
with your wet hands.

456
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,730
What are you upset about?

457
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,200
Or are you embarrassed of me?

458
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,380
Why would I be embarrased of you?

459
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,300
You're embarrassed because I pushed your head.

460
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,210
You're ridiculous.

461
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:47,290
So cute.

462
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,420
I'll hit you with vegetables.

463
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:51,570
Ouch!

464
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:58,480
Kana. I'll eat today.

465
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,150
I'm not eating tomorrow.

466
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,720
Yes.

467
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,600
Yes. I'll go now.

468
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:09,560
It's because of you.

469
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:12,530
Hurry up.

470
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:25,950
- Park.
- Huh?

471
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:26,542
For you.

472
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,190
Hey.

473
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:33,848
Sit over there.

474
00:31:34,284 --> 00:31:35,160
I don't want to.

475
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,720
I'm going to sit here because it's soft.

476
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,506
Do you have to crowd over here?

477
00:31:38,577 --> 00:31:39,093
Tin.

478
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,770
Would you like to sit on my lap?

479
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:44,400
You're irritating me.

480
00:31:44,408 --> 00:31:45,640
It's hot.

481
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,140
Please turn down the fire, Park.

482
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,520
- Honey.
- Huh?

483
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,320
Would you like to eat it?

484
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,880
- Is it delicious?
- Yes.

485
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,460
- But it's hot.
- Okay.

486
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,560
This couple is so sweet.

487
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,520
You tease them, but look at yourself!

488
00:32:08,324 --> 00:32:09,460
You pick food up for Pao only.

489
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,310
Look at this. Other people can't keep up with you.

490
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,350
You are a jealous child.

491
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,017
I'm not!

492
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:17,430
Really?

493
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:20,640
Oh, this is for you.

494
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,540
Eat it. So that you can die quickly.

495
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:26,650
Why don't you eat your own burnt food?

496
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,330
Kana. Is this your mouth?

497
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,970
If you have nothing to say just shut up and eat it.

498
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,880
I gave you a delicious one.

499
00:32:35,394 --> 00:32:36,166
This one?

500
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,560
Anyone want to help me clean up?

501
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:58,040
It's like this every time.

502
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,450
You guys are mean.

503
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,180
Just do it.

504
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,310
Pai, the hairstyle you
did for me is so beautiful.

505
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:10,000
Do you see? If you do
this part, it's more perfect.

506
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,310
Please cut here.

507
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,720
- In the back?
- Okay.

508
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:16,450
It's so beautiful. More, please.

509
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:22,520
Let's start the game now.

510
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,330
Please cut more, it points up.

511
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,391
What are you looking at?

512
00:33:32,924 --> 00:33:33,946
Nothing.

513
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,980
I'm not asking you to clean up.

514
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:49,540
It's okay. Put it down. I'll do it myself.

515
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,030
I'll help you.

516
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,200
Aren't you sleepy?

517
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:00,950
Yes.

518
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,630
Romeo hasn't eaten anything yet.

519
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:11,911
Huh? You don't fed him?

520
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,270
I was in a hurry this morning, so I forgot.

521
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,590
Just feed him.

522
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,710
Hey.

523
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,810
Please feed Romeo instead of me.

524
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,060
Please?

525
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,680
Okay.

526
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,360
Stop.

527
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,740
Stop your mouth.

528
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:22,530
What's with the parcel?
Why did it come late so late?

529
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,530
There's a lot.

530
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,133
Wow, I'm excited.

531
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:30,080
Why are you excited?
You ordered it yourself.

532
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:35,510
I'm just excited, Park. I ordered
so much that I forgot what I ordered.

533
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,130
Why? I'm surprised.

534
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,250
It's Winwin's special.

535
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,622
Winwin the main character?

536
00:35:48,773 --> 00:35:49,600
Yes!

537
00:35:50,084 --> 00:35:51,750
- Really?
- Yes.

538
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:53,030
Open it.

539
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,950
My hands are shaking.

540
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,620
Watch out for your hands.

541
00:35:58,347 --> 00:35:59,167
Wow.

542
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,050
So cute!

543
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,911
So cute.

544
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,060
I didn't think the doll would be so cute.

545
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,790
So cute.

546
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,410
Look at this, Tin.

547
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,700
Let me see.

548
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,380
Wow, Winwin. So cute!

549
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,510
Be careful!

550
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:35,570
Nevermind, Tin. Let him run.

551
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,031
Give it back.

552
00:36:39,217 --> 00:36:40,728
Is this Winwin the protagonist?

553
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,170
Wow, his hair messed up shortly after I ran.

554
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,840
Why are you running after me?
Winwin's hair is messed up.

555
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,810
Winwin, don't cry.

556
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:51,360
Give it back, Kana.

557
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,480
Winwin doesn't want to be with you.
Didn't you see his tears?

558
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,510
It's mine.

559
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,580
It's okay, Winwin.

560
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,890
Sit down, Kana.

561
00:37:01,264 --> 00:37:03,334
It's okay.

562
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,430
Please comb his hair, Pai.

563
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,850
Barbie, what is it?

564
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,950
What is it?

565
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,870
I've paid for it all.

566
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,630
Is it your hospital donation letter?

567
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,390
I just got the same one at school.

568
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,020
Why did they send it?

569
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:02,480
Hey! This is Palmthip's wedding invitation,
Park's ex-girlfriend.

570
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,680
But she probably didn't invite you.

571
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,700
She definitely sent this to ridicule you.

572
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:16,970
Yes, she just wanted to say
she found a better husband than you.

573
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:19,990
Yes.

574
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:23,920
She was very mean to send her
ex-boyfriend a wedding invitation.

575
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,950
I remember well how she hurt my husband.

576
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,120
You are the devil!

577
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,220
Stop! It seems you guys are more angry than me.

578
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,950
I'm not that regretful.

579
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:47,160
No regrets? You broke your heart
and played a Bogie Dodge song.

580
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:50,410
You've been crying loudly
through the house for months.

581
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,480
It's a 'Got Dumped' song, right?

582
00:38:53,857 --> 00:38:54,717
Yes.

583
00:38:56,246 --> 00:38:59,726
~Do you know who got dumped?~

584
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,740
Hey! Stop!

585
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,610
Crazy kids.

586
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:09,970
Isn't it a crazy kid like me who is
always by your side when you're sad?

587
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,380
Are you okay?

588
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,430
I didn't feel anything.

589
00:39:24,197 --> 00:39:25,227
Forget it.

590
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:30,650
Will you go to her wedding?

591
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,180
I won't.

592
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:46,390
It's the same day as your birthday.
I have to be with you.
