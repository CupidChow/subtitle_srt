00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,600
Hello everyone.

3
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,080
My name is "Tin"

4
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,360
I live here at "Pawini Bakery".

5
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,840
The most famous bakery in this area.

6
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,800
If you mention about dessert.

7
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,160
Pawini Bakery is well known.

8
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,040
I will call this place as home

9
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,720
even it is not

10
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,880

11
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,600

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,840
neighbor who adored me since I was young

13
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,720
mum can I go out to play with my friends?

14
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,360
Yes of course, take care of your friends
and your brother, okay?

15
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,720
Yes mum, Thank you.

16
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,080
Have fun.

17
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,880
Take care

18
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,440
but Aunt "Pawini" just passed away recently

19
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,520
because of decease that can't cure

20
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,520
and the reason that I still live here because.

(Run Kantheephop play Park)

26
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,240
Why did you return home early?

27
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,960
I miss you so much!

28
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,600

29
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,880

30
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,800

33
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,840
Do we have an ice cube?

34
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,080
Ice?

35
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,640
No, we do not have.

36
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,400
Can you go to buy an ice?

37
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,840
Sure! I will get an ice for you.

38
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Brother "Park".

39
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,320
I don't have any money.

40
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,280
"Kana" your customer is waiting for you.

41
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,440
Alright.

42
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,520

(Tong Surawit Ruangyod play Kana)

44
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,560
I've call you many times.

I want to buy an ice for 10 Baht.

46
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,360
Did you eat ice instead of a meal?

47
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,160
Are you a neighbor of a polar bear?

48
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,000
Are you going to sell it?

49
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,680
My shop sells many things,
but you only buy an ice.

50
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,640
Hey "Park".

51
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,696
Did you finish your job early today?

52
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,720
Yeah.

53
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,920
Who's that?

54
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,520
My niece

55
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,760
my cousin ask me to take care of her

56
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,480
because her parent working in Bangkok

57
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,320

58
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,160
say hi to uncle "Park".

59
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,680
Hello Uncle "Park"

60
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,640
why are you calling me "Uncle"?

61
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,680
Just call me "Brother"

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,440
because you are the oldest

63
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,840
there you go, your ice Mr. polar bear.

64
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,000
Keep eating ice for the whole day

65
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,760
why don't you bring money yourself?

66
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,680
I sell many things and you keep buying just an ice

67
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,400
why are you keep mumbling?

68
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,160
Don't you have a 10 Baht coin?

69
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,120
Nope, but those coin is money as well.

70
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,080
These little coins are heavy.

71
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,080
Heavy?

72
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,720
Why don't you put the coin in your mouth then?

73
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,040
Fine, can I have an egg then?

74
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,120
An egg?

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,560
Yes just one egg.

76
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,160
"Tong" Can you get an egg for me.

77
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,920
Why did you buy an egg? What is it for?

78
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,360
I bought an egg for you "Kana".

79
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,920
Damn you "Tin"!

80
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,240
You bastard!

81
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,760
Tin!

82
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,800
Come here!

83
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,160
Stop this at once!

84
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,280
Two of you

85
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,280

86
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,280

87
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,320

88
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,120

89
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,440

90
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,480
Come here

91
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,776
if you guys don't stop fighting,
I will hit both of you!

92
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,920
Park just let him come at me

93
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,240
come here "Kana".

94
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,880
"Kana" stop it just get inside your shop.

95
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,760
"Tin" you have to stop it now.

96
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,040
You two keep fighting like children.

97
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
Let's go back.

98
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,040
Let me go.

99
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,720
Release me.

100
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,440
Why did you do this to me?

101
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,920
You're acting like children.

102
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,440
Isn't that because of "Kana" is rude to you?

103
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,640
He is rude as usual.

104
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,920
You need to control your temper.

105
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,040
What is wrong with you?

106
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,120
Not wrong

107
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,600
because I am your boyfriend.

108
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,040
I'm going to kick you.

109
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,680
Brother "Park"

110
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,200
well, you be on duty nearly everyday.

111
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,640
You didn't eat and sleep enough.

112
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,320
That's why you are slow response like a sloth.

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,160
So, will you go anywhere?

114
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,520
Nope I won't go anywhere.

115
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,240
You should get some rest.

116
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,520
Did Romeo eat anything?

117
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,720
Romeo ate before you.

118
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,640
Romeo.

119
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,000
How are you doing?

120
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,280
Did you eat anything yet?

121
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,720
Are you tired of swimming?

122
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,080
If you are tired, Just stop swim.

123
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,320
Wait a minute.

124
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,000
If he stops swim, he might drown and die.

125
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,840
Brother "Park"

126
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,720
Romeo is a fish!

127
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,400
He won't die from drown

128
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,960

129
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,960
Hurry up

130
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,600

131
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,840
your brain is not function at all.

132
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,840
Get up now

133
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,680
just go get some rest.

134
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,800
Please go to bed.

135
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,520
Please

136
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,920
sleep well.

137
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,240
Who gave you this?

138
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,520
None of your business.

139
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,200
Why did you scold me, that hurt my feeling.

140
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,000
The nurse who was on duty with me, gave it to me.

141
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,040
You can have it.

142
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,640
Normally you don't like this kind of snack.

143
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,800
Yes.

144
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,520
Didn't you just eat a lot recently?

145
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,520
Are you still hungry?

146
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
You are small, why do you eat a lot.

147
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,760
I'm not full yet.

148
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,320
Nothing makes me full.

149
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,640
How about my foot?

150
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,240
Get out, I need some privacy!

151
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,600
I just look at you and didn't say a word.

152
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,520
When did you start being so barbaric?

153
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,880
Since you started to be naughty.

154
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,480
Get out, I need to sleep.

155
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,760
Are you going to sleep while your hair still wet?

156
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,160
Stay still.

157
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,560
Let me wipe the hair for you.

158
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,440
If you are hungry, just help yourself.

159
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,040
I know, don't worry.

160
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,680
You should sleep soon.

161
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,480
I'll wake you up.

162
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,560
Why are you covering me with blanket?

163
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,400
It is so hot here.

164
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,440
I Hate you.

165
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,440
I hate you too.

166
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,120
Tin!

167
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,240
Tin.

168
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,320
Kana!

169
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,880
Why are you shouting?

170
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,880
Who is the girl beside you?

171
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,000
She is not a stranger, this girl is your sister.

172
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,880
Huh really? When?!

173
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,040
Her name is "Manaw" the daughter of your mum's boyfriend.

174
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,120
Say hi to your brother "Tin"

175
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,280
sawasdee.

176
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,280
Does my mum see you in person?

177
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,760
Yes

178
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,240
why doesn't she come to see me?

179
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,160
Your mum felt guilty.

180
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,560
She don't want to face you.

181
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
Really?

182
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,360
Anyway just take care of "Manaw" okay?

183
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,480
I have to go back to my shop.

184
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,760
But I have an art teaching schedule soon.

185
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,200
That's great.

186
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,680
So "Manaw" can attend your art class.

187
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,720
Okay, fine.

188
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,080

Okay.

190
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,120
Could you please bring her to the art class area,
so she can join her classmate.

191
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,000
I need to clear my stuff before teaching.

192
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,680
Let's go, shall we?

193
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,720
Get ready to paint and draw.

194
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,760
Everyone listens, you can talk but

195
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,800
please keep your voice down, don't make noise, okay?

196
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,800
Okay

197
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,360
because "Park" is sleeping.

198
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,400
Sawasdee.

199
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,720
Sawasdee.

200
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,320
Today everyone has to draw future occupation.

201
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,520
What you want to be in the future?

202
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,480
"Beam" What do you want to be in the future?

203
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,280
In the future I want to be a nurse.

204
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,520
I want to work as a nurse same as my mum

205
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,200
and I want to help other people as well.

206
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,776
How about you "Mai"? What do you want to be in the future?

207
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,096
I want to be a model, so I can wear many beautiful cloths.

208
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,360
Very well.

209
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,360
I want to be a police.

210
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,480
So, you want to be a policeman!

211
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,480
Yes sir

212
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,200
I want to be a doctor.

213
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,640
Oh you want to be a doctor.

214
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,400
When I grow up I want to be an actress.

215
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,040
I want to be super hero!

216
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,880
I want to be a teacher

217
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,760
a teacher.

218
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,320
When I grow up I want to be Idol.

219
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,320
Idol wow.

220
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,080
Each of them seemed very excited about their dream career.

221
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,040
Who's know?

222
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,840
When they grow up, their childhood dreams might faded away.

223
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,280
Just because of the factors around us
regardless of family background, money.

224
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,840
Including the environment that surrounds us

225
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,520
that sometimes cannot support us to achieve our dreams.

226
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,680
Like me, instead of practicing my skill.

227
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,240
To follow my dream.

228
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,520
I have to teach special class to earn money.

229
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,240
Because I don't want to bother "Park".

230
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,640
What a sad story.

231
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,360
Here comes an ice cream!

232
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,520

233
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,800

239
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,800
Yes, I enjoyed.

240
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,840
Is the class finish yet?

241
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,840
Yes, the class is finished.

242
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,080
Very well, your mum just called me
and said she will come to picku up "Manaw" soon.

243
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,800
Alright.

244
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,480
Do you want to see your mum?

245
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,800
Nope.

246
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,440
If she really wants to see me,
she will come to see me herself.

247
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,040
Did you have a good time?

248
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,040
Yes.

249
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,280
Until we meet again, see you later "Manaw".

250
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,280
Yes

251
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,560
let's go.

252
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,440
Sawasdee, Brother "Tin".

253
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,960
Why mum doesn't care about me.

254
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,640
I miss you mum

255
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,200
I want to stay with you.

256
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,880
Hello everyone.

257
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,880
Hello there.

258
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,800
Grand Pa, I am so hungry.

259
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,560
Tin, what would you like to order?

260
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,240
He always orders the same menu.

261
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,640
Same menu as usual?

262
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,640
Yes, Uncle.

263
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,880
Can I get Chrysanthemum​ tea as well

264
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,080
anything for you

265
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,240
take a seat.

266
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,200
Can I sit with you?

267
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,880
No seat for you

268
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,240
no seat? Are you serious? These are all empty.

269
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,640
Nope, my guardian goddess already sitting on it.
Can't you see her?

270
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,200
Now I sit on your guardian goddess.

271
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,480
You! You're a sinner.

272
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,640
How dare you sit on my guardian goddess.

273
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,000
I told your guardian goddess.
To sit opposite instead

274
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,880
I have two guardian goddess.

275
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,920
No one welcome people like you!

276
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,440
Go away

277
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,080
no way.

278
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,680
That's enough.

279
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,680
Kana

280
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,096
you fought with "Tin" once this morning.

281
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,400
Let "Tin" Sit here.

282
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,680
Okay.

283
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,480
Thank you.

284
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,480
Serve you right!

285
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,840
Can I sit with you guys?

286
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,000
Barbie do not sit close to him.

287
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,600
He's dirty.

288
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,320
Dirty?

289
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,560
You are dirty.

290
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,880
I saw it.

291
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,400
Okay.

292
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,480
Why don't Park come with you?

293
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,800
Park, he is sleeping

294
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,320
he has to be on duty in the afternoon.

295
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,160
Oh well, he's always on duty

296
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,880
seem like I didn't see him for a few weeks.

297
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,480
I think "Park" doesn't want to see you.

298
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,880
He might afraid that if he see you,
he will have a nightmare.

299
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,920
Shut your mouth.

300
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,040
Grand Pa!

301
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,040
Kana!

302
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,600
Yes.

303
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,360
Serve you right.

304
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,080
Hey, when did you guys arrive?

305
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,960
For a while

306
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,960
see you in a bit.

307
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,720
"Pao" The more he grows up, the more handsome he is.

308
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,200
I think he is the most handsome guy in this area.

309
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,720
Well, I think he is the most handsome in the province.

310
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,720
Did you own "Pao" a debt?

311
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,720
What debt?

312
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,840
If you didn't own "Pao" a debt.

313
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,760
"Pao" might paid you

314
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,320
nonsense.

315
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,360
He is a good person.

316
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,520
So I gave him a compliment.

317
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,440
Good person and handsome are the difference things.

318
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,120
Do you like "Pao"?

319
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,560
Can I get a water?

320
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,040
Uncle.

321
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,680
Can I get a water for "Kana".

322
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,600
Please give me a water.

323
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,200
No more water in this glass.

324
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,840
Would you like to drink mind?

325
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,600
I got my own.

326
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,000
Let me drink your first.

327
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,120
You are too old to play dolls.

328
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,200
Do you really think I am that old?

329
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,920
"Tin" Please help me count.

330
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,160
My finger isn't enough.

331
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,640
You little evil, I am going to slap you.

332
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,960
How long will you stay here?

333
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,120
I will go back before my school start new semester.

334
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,880
Uncle Nop's farm got a lot of fruits.

335
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,800
Lot of fruits? Why don't you help your uncle at the farm then.

336
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,960
Because it is so hot!

337
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,240
I prefer to stay with you and help you pack things

338
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,520
you're talking too much,
shut your mouth and start packing

339
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,040
we have to deliver on time.

340
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,480
Tin, when will Park has Day off?

341
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,680
On Wednesday.

342
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,480
But he has to stand by for his duty at the hospital.

343
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,840
So that's not a day off.

344
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,840
Well, That's his routine.

345
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,040
At least he has a full-time job.

346
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,720
Better than nothing to do.

347
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,880
Not like me, my father is still complaining about my life.

348
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,880
He thought that I don't work at all.

349
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,080
Barbie please do not say like that.

350
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,360
It's not true that you don't have a job.

351
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,640
You used to be an exchange student aboard,
and you can speak three languages.

352
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,040
Not to mention about your translation job
that you always get

353
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,560
and pre-album that idol fans order from you

354
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,440
see you got many things to do!

355
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,400
Tin, Thats the sweetest word ever

356
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,760
once we deliver these boxes to customers

357
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,040
I will buy you bubble tea.

358
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,040
Really?

359
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,600
Well, Can I order special tea and add extra Bubble?

360
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,440
Fine

361
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
I want it too!

362
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,760
Don't be greedy, little devil.

363
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,880
I spoke with "Putsorn" recently

364
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,800
they haven't got a chance to talk each other for a while.

365
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,680
She texts "Park" but no response.

366
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,840
"Park" is slow like Sloth.

367
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,920
"Park" See everything but decided not to response.

368
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,640
Not only "Putsorn" his real sister.

369
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,920
Even me who live in the same house as "Park".

370
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,920
Park ignores my text either.

371
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,640
If you want to talk with "Park"

372
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,080
you need to arrange the date at least 2 days before.

373
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,560
Did he realize that he is a slow response?

374
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,640
Or he only keep shouting.

375
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,440
Hurry up, so we can enjoy bubble tea

376
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,120
look at this.

377
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,880
Can I have a glass of bubble tea?

378
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
Okay.

379
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,480
Hey, Bai Tong why are you here alone?

380
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,120
Kana told me to buy bubble tea for him
because he has to stay at the shop.

381
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,120
Stop it! I will buy for you.

382
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,120
Thank you.

383
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,520
Can I get 3 bubble tea please.

384
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,760
Okay.

385
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,000
Barbie you are brilliant,
you like Idol and turn it into a business.

386
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,400
Love runs the world, you know Tin.

387
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,120
Even though my father said it was nonsense.

388
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,440
But I earn money from it

389
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,480
one day he will understand.

390
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,480
I believe that.

391
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,040
If you need someone to help you pack things just let me know.

392
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,120
Tin, You're cute.

393
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,520
Would you like to order anything else?

394
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,160
Can you add this topping to my bubble tea

395
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,720

396
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,720

397
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,440
and this as well

398
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,080
okay.

399
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,320
When I told you that I will pay.
Well, This is a lot of orders

400
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,680
because you said so.

401
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,720
Didn't you add extra bubble?

402
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,840
Look at mind compare to your.

403
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,880
Here's come the victim.

404
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,880
Hello Mr.tomboy Barbie. So you like bubble tea?

405
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,160
Tomboy your arse

406
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,160
Barbie is a lady.

407
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,800
Oh really?

408
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,840
I can't call her lady

409
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,880
true that.

410
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,160
Shut up.

411
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,880
Well, which one is a lady or a man.

412
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,640
One person is fussy, one person looks manly.

413
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,640
So did both of you exchange gender?

414
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,240
No matter what my gender are.

415
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,640
Is there any problem with you guys?

416
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,240
Now she is angry.

417
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,320
Just leave us alone.

418
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,520
Or should I tell your parent your behavior

419
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,800
that you still own debt at internet cafe

420
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,280
or should I tell the policeman.

421
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,680
Policeman? Come on we are just teasing you

422
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,800
because you thought it was fun to tease other people

423
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,480
stop bullies other people

424
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,240
for the sake of community.

425
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,120
Just leave!

426
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,120
Leave!

427
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,280
Barbie that's awesome

428
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,920
those guys deserve it

429
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,880
no matter what gender you are.

430
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,880
We are all human being.

431
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,320
Did you see their face?

432
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,920
When you scold them, their face turned pale

433
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,480
Barbie you are just like a rapper

434
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,880
because they make me angry.

435
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,360
What are you going to do after this?

436
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,200
I will bring this bubble tea for Park.

437
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,560
Uncle "Tong".

438
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,080
Are you okay?

439
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,560
Uncle "Tong".

440
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,760
What's happening?

441
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,440
Barbie your phone!

00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,520

443
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,120
Hurry up.

444
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,000
Uncle "Tong".

445
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,200
Park help us

446
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,320

447
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,000
Kana.

448
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,520
Kana!

449
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,960
Call the ambulance.

450
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,480
Ambulance!

451
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,080
What's happening to you?

452
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,200

453
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,320

we do not know what is happening he is already unconscious.

457
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,040
He's bleeding

458
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,040

459
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,640
please send ambulance now.

460
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,440
I just saw an ambulance drive pass,
What's the matter?

461
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,000
Uncle "Tong" fell off and his head hit the floor.

462
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,160
Is he okay?

463
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,680
I don't know yet

464
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,680
then who company uncle "Tong' to hospital."

465
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,320
Park go with uncle.

466
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,160
Aunt Tim is on the way.

467
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,920
Tim

468
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,080
I will drive you to hospital.

469
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,920
Thank you.

470
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,480
Grand Pa, please take care of the restaurant.

471
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,320
Do not worry Auntie we will take care for you.

472
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,120
Grand Pa will uncle "Tong" okay?

473
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,000
Should we call "Pao"?

474
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,920
Pao he still working

475
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,240
don't disturb him

476
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,240
but that's his father.

477
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,720
Kana.

478
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,200
Did you told Park to come here?

479
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,640
Yes.

480
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,840
This situation the only person that I can think of is "Park"

481
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,880
so I ask for him for help.

482
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,680
You did the right thing.

483
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,680
If Park is not here, I don't know what to do.

484
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,800
Uncle "Tong" might be bleeding until he's dead.

485
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,080
I will prepare things for Park.

486
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,520
He has to be on duty after this.

487
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,440
Grand pa I'm leaving

488
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,640
sawasdee.

489
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,880
Park

490
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,880
how is uncle Tong.

491
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,920
He's getting better.

492
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,280
Good to hear that

493
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,160
here's your bag.

494
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,120
I know that you have to be on duty after this

495
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,120
so I pack things for you.

496
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,240
Are you tired?

497
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,520
Would you like to have some coffee?

498
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,520
I'll get it for you.

499
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,640
No it's okay

500
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,680
drinking coffee make me want to poop.

501
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,760
I knew you are going to say that.

502
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,160
You know me too well.

503
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,960
Of course I know you well

504
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,280
because I sit in your heart.

505
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,960
Do you want to get out of my heart
and stay in emergency room instead?

506
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,720
I'll kick you

507
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,280
why are you so cruel.

508
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,640
Will you stop crying like a baby?

509
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,560
I want to kick you more!

510
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,480
Can't you just be nice for one day?

511
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,800
I just pack things and brought you your belonging.

512
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,200
I didn't hear you thank me at all.

513
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,640
Thank you

514
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,600
go back home safely

515
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,680
I have to keep working.

516
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,160
Why are you smilling?

517
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,240
Oh you're early

518
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,840

519
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,960

520
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,560
So I have to do first aid
and go with ambulance to hospital.

521
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,360
That's why you are early

522
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,000
who's this? Is she your daugther?

523
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,720
Watch your mouth.

524
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,920

526
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,640
no one take care of her

527
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,920
she got sick for the past two days

528
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,520

00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,840
Bring her for snack.

545
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,000
Park is a nice guy.
Don't forget to buy me a snack too.

546
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,520

549
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,680
I didn't drive.

550
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,040
What do you want to buy.

551
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,720
Pick what you want.

552
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,400
Do you want this one?

561
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,936
I know that you didn't bring your motorcycle.

562
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,000
So I decided to come here to pick you up

563
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000

00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,840
Park

565
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,920

00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,720
Will you walk back home?

567
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,720

568
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,760

It's late now.

570
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,560

00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,200
Mum if you don't pick me up

572
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,200

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,520
Park why did you come back by your self?

574
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,320

576
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,880

It's okay Tin.

587
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,160
Because uncle Tui on the way to pick up Park,
That's why he's dead

00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,000
If uncle Tui don't go to pick me up.

591
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,560
He won't die.

592
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,680
It's alright.

593
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,120

00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,720
I will not forgive my self.

595
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,040
When will you stop blaming your self.

596
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,560
