(Tin Tem Jai)
(Episode 10)

2
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,590
Park!

3
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,340
Huh?

4
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,600
Why are you washing the dishes?

5
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,340
I'll wash it myself.

6
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,460
I can wash it.

7
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,340
Why do you need to wash it?

8
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,960
It's my duty.

9
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,420
Did I ever tell you?

10
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,060
I remember I never said it.

11
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,200
I live in your house for free.

12
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,880
I have to do something in return for you.

13
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,880
You don't have to do everything.

14
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,100
If you're lazy, just leave it.

15
00:02:16,523 --> 00:02:17,453
I'll do it myself.

16
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,450
I'm willing to do everything for you.

17
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,380
Uh.

18
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,320
Huh?

19
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,020
Please help me clean the house today.

20
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,660
Because I've been with
the old stuff for too long.

21
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,460
I'll help you.

22
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,540
Park!

23
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,160
Huh?

24
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,880
What about this?

25
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,820
My mom really likes this vase.

26
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,490
Please keep it there.

27
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,180
Right here?

28
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:36,820
Yes.

29
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,990
Park.

30
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:49,540
Huh?

31
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:50,710
Are you thirsty?

32
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,210
I'll bring you some water.

33
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,400
I want orange juice.

34
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,170
No more orange juice.

35
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,400
Oh, really?

36
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,760
Umm.

37
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,360
I will buy it if I go to the market.

38
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,800
It's okay.

39
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,870
I'll call my father to bring it to us.

40
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,180
Hello, dad.

41
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,780
Can you send me an orange?

42
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,290
You can send parcels to me.

43
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,350
Or... you can drive here.

44
00:04:30,595 --> 00:04:31,805
Please bring lots of them.

45
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:32,930
We can eat it in time.

46
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,100
Yeah.

47
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,330
Done.

48
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:56,610
Uh.

49
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,220
Babe.

50
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,390
After taking out the trash,

51
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,350
shall we find something to eat?

52
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,140
Sure.

53
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,980
Park! Tin!

54
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,080
Sit here.

55
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,080
Uncle Tong.

56
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,700
I want the same dish as I ordered.

57
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,930
Park too.

58
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,490
Okay.

59
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,280
Done.

60
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,650
This is your dish, Tin.

61
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,150
This is your dish, Park.

62
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,500
Thank you.

63
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,720
Wow.

64
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,850
Why Park got more than me?

65
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,180
Alright.

66
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,090
Park works hard. He must eat a lot.

67
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,440
Thank you.

68
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,060
That's right.

69
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,640
Eat well, Park.

70
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,370
I'm not complaining anymore.

71
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:12,740
Park.

72
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,740
I want to drink bubble tea.

73
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,140
Are you not full yet?

74
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,070
I just want to drink it.

75
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,970
Please?

76
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,670
I want to drink it. Please?

77
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,510
Okay.

78
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,200
Just go for it.

79
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,800
Yay!

80
00:06:27,836 --> 00:06:28,586
I'll go with you.

81
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,230
Please?

82
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,020
Park, please?

83
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,090
Just go.

84
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,280
Pao, would you like to go with us?

85
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:37,970
No.

86
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,620
I will help my dad work.

87
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,300
Let's go.

88
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:45,560
Bye.

89
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,300
Bill, please.

90
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,890
Oh, sure.

91
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,490
Thank you.

92
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,280
I will come here again.

93
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,630
Thank you so much.

94
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,750
I worked hard but didn't spend a penny.

95
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:06,080
Wow.

96
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,150
It's very crowded.

97
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,910
It's okay, Park.

98
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,150
I'll handle it myself.

99
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,810
Guys, there are people fighting here!

100
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:15,920
There are people fighting here!

101
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,900
Hurry up!! Run!!

102
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,370
Run!!

103
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,170
But you don't have to run.

104
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:21,840
Yeah.

105
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,840
Please make us bubble tea first.

106
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,970
Sure.

107
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,250
What would you like?

108
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,600
I want a little sweet bubble tea.

109
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,860
What? Kana?

110
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,200
You took my queue.

111
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,490
I'm the one who said I
wanted to drink it first.

112
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,830
Just ask Park if you don't believe me.

113
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,920
Do you see? Is there a queue?

114
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,230
I cleared the queue for you.

115
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,870
Therefore, I must be the first in queue.

116
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,500
No!

117
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,200
Can you guys stop fighting?

118
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,680
I have a headache.

119
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,240
Ask Pai and Barbie if they want bubble
tea too, we can get them some too.

120
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,240
I'll ask them.

121
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,410
It's going to run out.

122
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,730
I should've bought 2 glasses.

123
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,180
You're not full yet?

124
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,270
You said it would save
me money, didn't you?

125
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,660
Why are you drinking so much?

126
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,260
I just like it.

127
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,570
You mean bubble tea?

128
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,260
It's you.

129
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,260
What era is it now?

130
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,340
I don't think anyone still
uses this method these days.

131
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,700
It's very old.

132
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,600
Oh. What about my bubble tea?

133
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,390
Here.

134
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,460
Thank you, Tin.

135
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:35,680
Thank you.

136
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:38,740
Park...

137
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:39,640
Huh?

138
00:08:39,665 --> 00:08:41,445
Can I sleep with you tonight?

139
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,200
Sure.

140
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,070
Are you okay?

141
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:00,420
I'm glad that you can
move on from the past.

142
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:04,560
Both Aunt Pavini and Uncle Keng.

143
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,180
I am more than grateful to you

144
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:14,400
for helping me through
such difficult times.

145
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,150
Here.

146
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,560
From now on,

147
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,350
you can sleep with me every day.

148
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,200
Really?

149
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,120
Yeah.

150
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,697
Would you like to stop?

151
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,760
If you don't stop me now,

152
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,760
I won't stop.

153
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,320
Who said I would stop?

154
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,180
Park.

155
00:11:21,371 --> 00:11:22,271
Wake up!

156
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,530
Park.

157
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,950
Wake up.

158
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,380
I'm so sleepy.

159
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,730
Can I sleep more?

160
00:11:35,455 --> 00:11:36,525
No!

161
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,280
Ouch!

162
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,200
Today is Lunar New Year.

163
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,600
They set off firecrackers
all over the alley.

164
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,330
How can you still sleep?

165
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,050
Now it's time to pay
homage to the ancestors.

166
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,800
Get up!

167
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,700
Just do it.

168
00:11:53,405 --> 00:11:55,105
But they are your ancestors.

169
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,120
I just...

170
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,190
Park!

171
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,420
Get up!

172
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,980
Get up!

173
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,230
Alright.

174
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,050
Get up!

175
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,230
I got up.

176
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,560
So I'll take a shower first.

177
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,240
Please take a shower

178
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,890
and meet me downstairs.

179
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,940
I'll follow you later.

180
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:46,780
Oh?

181
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,880
Park.

182
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,470
Huh?

183
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,850
Why don't you wear the
shirt I prepared for you?

184
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,560
It's red now.

185
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,390
How am I wrong?

186
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,750
I mean a new shirt.

187
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,120
I hung it up for you.

188
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,730
It's the same.

189
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,480
No.

190
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:01,650
Take it off.

191
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,250
I'll get you a new shirt.

192
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,760
Yeah.

193
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,820
Here.

194
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,600
Please hold it.

195
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,560
Hey!

196
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,850
Are you going to show off your body?

197
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,800
Why?

198
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,560
Change in the house.

199
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,680
You don't even know about it.

200
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,540
I always have to tell you.

201
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,940
I hung the first shirt for you.

202
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,590
Didn't you see it?

203
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,460
What is it? The other
house has finished.

204
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,820
This house is still trying
to figure out clothes.

205
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,150
How good is it that I'm awake?

206
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,330
Would you wake up if I didn't wake you up?

207
00:13:46,317 --> 00:13:49,407
Make your ancestors wait until next year?

208
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:55,310
Can you manage anything without me?

209
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:56,590
Here.

210
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,190
Let's light a candle.

211
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,370
Please cover it for me.

212
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,750
Got it.

213
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,220
Hold it.

214
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,860
It's okay, just assume we've lit it.

215
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,540
Are you crazy?

216
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,610
What is your blessing?

217
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,430
I'm not telling you.

218
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:33,670
Why?

219
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,190
Sure.

220
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,870
Let's start with this one first.

221
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,180
Because it's a way ticket.

222
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,520
Put it down.

223
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:50,640
Park.

224
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,110
Huh?

225
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:57,620
Do you think people who have passed away
will really be able to eat these foods?

226
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,350
Food is placed here, right?

227
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,900
Just by lighting an incense stick,

228
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,880
it can teleport food to heaven?

229
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,660
There is a restaurant in heaven.

230
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,528
The food that we put here,

231
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:18,030
it's to tell the heavens that we
will order these for our ancestors.

232
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:23,180
We can light some incense for the
waiter in heaven to take our order.

233
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,160
They would cook it at a
restaurant for our ancestors.

234
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,520
Oh.

235
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,600
We burn paper money to
buy heavenly food, right?

236
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,480
Yes.

237
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,310
Here.

238
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,490
Why did you give it to me?

239
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,840
I have to pay respects to
you on Chinese New Year.

240
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,800
Am I your ancestor?

241
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,350
You are an adult.

242
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,120
You and I don't really differ in age.

243
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,390
Excluding my mother,

244
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,850
you are the only adult
in my family that I have.

245
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,190
They usually use 4-8 oranges, don't they?

246
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,980
Is it enough for you?

247
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,490
You usually eat a pile of oranges.

248
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:17,770
Here.

249
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,850
I wish you good health.

250
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,340
I wish you lots of sleep and rest.

251
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,390
I wish you to love me,

252
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,500
adore me,

253
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,490
not kick me,

254
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,660
and give me a marriage proposal soon.

255
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,360
Crazy child.

256
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,040
Oh.

257
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:47,780
Here.

258
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,840
May you live ten thousand years.

259
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,840
You're crazy.

260
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,060
I want to have Lunar New
Year every day, don't you agree?

261
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,040
Aren't you tired?

262
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,070
You wake up early to prepare.

263
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:08,040
Once a year, it's enough.

264
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,410
I'm willing to do it.

265
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:25,570
Your question this morning,
if I can do anything without you...

266
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,630
I can't.

267
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,000
I need you by my side.

268
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,480
Thank you

269
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,930
for being with me.

270
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,060
Hey, Park.

271
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,040
What's wrong with you?

272
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,660
Yeah.

273
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,260
Park!

274
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,530
Who is your brother?

275
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:49,670
Fu... Park!

276
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,200
I'm sorry.

277
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,180
You start first.

278
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,170
I have to say it back.

279
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,520
Yeah.

280
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:02,631
I am your brother.

281
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,230
It's true.

282
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,440
Why?

283
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,120
It's my business!

284
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:09,680
Huh?

285
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,862
Why are you upset at me?

286
00:18:32,222 --> 00:18:33,448
You look at me and say nothing.

287
00:18:33,591 --> 00:18:34,435
What do you want?

288
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:37,161
I don't have the courage to say it.

289
00:18:38,044 --> 00:18:39,546
I don't know your mood.

290
00:18:39,546 --> 00:18:40,868
You don't say what happened to you.

291
00:18:41,084 --> 00:18:42,257
Nothing happened to me.

292
00:18:43,546 --> 00:18:44,488
Come close to me.

293
00:18:44,986 --> 00:18:46,124
I don't sit near you.

294
00:18:46,524 --> 00:18:47,911
You'll get annoyed at me again.

295
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:51,173
Do I seem so upset?

296
00:18:51,653 --> 00:18:52,053
Huh?

297
00:18:52,213 --> 00:18:53,875
Only with me.

298
00:18:54,506 --> 00:18:55,377
I'm sorry.

299
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:59,324
But I'm really annoyed
with you today.

300
00:18:59,893 --> 00:19:01,093
I can't be upset with you?

301
00:19:01,768 --> 00:19:03,090
What have I done wrong with you?

302
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:04,435
Just...

303
00:19:05,504 --> 00:19:06,801
You're annoying.

304
00:19:07,368 --> 00:19:08,666
I was annoyed just
seeing your face.

305
00:19:09,226 --> 00:19:10,204
Park!

306
00:19:10,631 --> 00:19:12,240
Just annoyed to death!

307
00:19:13,146 --> 00:19:13,831
Huh?

308
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,160
[No Park zone]

309
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,930
[I hate Park!!]

310
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,030
[No Park!]

311
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,560
[I hate Park]

312
00:19:29,093 --> 00:19:29,991
Babe.

313
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,675
Let's eat.

314
00:19:33,262 --> 00:19:34,453
Please come out.

315
00:19:35,955 --> 00:19:36,897
No way!

316
00:19:37,937 --> 00:19:41,440
You said you were annoyed
just by seeing my face.

317
00:19:41,937 --> 00:19:43,244
I'm not going out to show
you my face anymore!

318
00:19:43,813 --> 00:19:45,075
I hate you!

319
00:19:46,284 --> 00:19:47,653
Even if you cry?

320
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,413
Well.

321
00:19:59,911 --> 00:20:01,457
If you don't love me then,

322
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,377
I'll go.

323
00:20:14,364 --> 00:20:14,977
Hey!

324
00:20:15,671 --> 00:20:16,613
Park, get out!

325
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,142
Get out!

326
00:20:19,804 --> 00:20:20,684
Let's eat.

327
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,226
No.

328
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,893
You can eat whatever you want.

329
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:25,235
No.

330
00:20:26,115 --> 00:20:28,462
Then I can apologize to you 100 times.

331
00:20:28,782 --> 00:20:29,760
Stop it.

332
00:20:30,044 --> 00:20:31,102
I hate you.

333
00:20:32,337 --> 00:20:33,520
Don't hate me.

334
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,880
I hate you.

335
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,684
Then I'll go.

336
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,511
Hey, Park!

337
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:43,262
I won't hate you anymore.

338
00:20:43,831 --> 00:20:45,671
How can I hate you?

339
00:20:46,435 --> 00:20:47,804
I really love you.

340
00:20:49,075 --> 00:20:52,746
I'm just angry that you
said I was annoying.

341
00:20:53,644 --> 00:20:55,191
But my anger subsided

342
00:20:55,706 --> 00:20:56,968
after you asked me to reconcile.

343
00:20:57,128 --> 00:20:58,382
It's frustrating.

344
00:20:58,844 --> 00:21:00,933
Why do you have to make
me love you this much?

345
00:21:01,191 --> 00:21:02,257
I'm sorry.

346
00:21:03,111 --> 00:21:04,257
Can you not be angry with me?

347
00:21:13,102 --> 00:21:13,786
Park.

348
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,226
Are you okay?

349
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,400
Are you sick?

350
00:21:16,755 --> 00:21:17,760
No.

351
00:21:20,755 --> 00:21:22,435
Hey, wake up.

352
00:21:23,128 --> 00:21:24,000
Let's talk first.

353
00:21:24,622 --> 00:21:26,195
Did you hear that news?

354
00:21:26,346 --> 00:21:29,670
Duangjai revealed her boyfriend.

355
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:30,542
He's younger.

356
00:21:31,315 --> 00:21:32,035
Who?

357
00:21:33,466 --> 00:21:35,573
Huh? You missed the news.

358
00:21:35,573 --> 00:21:40,296
That one from OPD room who
has been flirting with her for years.

359
00:21:40,657 --> 00:21:42,071
Finally, her heart melted.

360
00:21:42,106 --> 00:21:43,688
Young people are good.

361
00:21:44,764 --> 00:21:48,560
People gossip about how
many days they can date.

362
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,791
They are different in age.

363
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:54,568
No matter... Yeah.

364
00:21:54,844 --> 00:21:56,604
What's wrong with dating younger people?

365
00:21:57,128 --> 00:21:58,693
Has anyone ever told you that
dating younger people is wrong?

366
00:22:00,017 --> 00:22:01,928
They gossip about it.

367
00:22:03,564 --> 00:22:04,373
Hold on.

368
00:22:05,102 --> 00:22:06,062
Why are you bothering about it?

369
00:22:06,088 --> 00:22:06,462
Huh?

370
00:22:06,462 --> 00:22:07,193
No.

371
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,711
You seem suspicious.

372
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,595
- Huh? Park.
- No.

373
00:22:10,853 --> 00:22:12,168
Nothing.

374
00:22:12,435 --> 00:22:14,560
It seems like it struck a nerve.

375
00:22:14,906 --> 00:22:16,071
Is that right?

376
00:22:16,071 --> 00:22:16,712
Yeah.

377
00:22:16,817 --> 00:22:17,973
Or do you prefer younger people?

378
00:22:18,862 --> 00:22:20,933
You seemed to care about younger topics.

379
00:22:21,502 --> 00:22:22,275
No.

380
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:23,848
If I knew it.

381
00:22:25,617 --> 00:22:26,408
Tin!

382
00:22:27,128 --> 00:22:28,008
Tin!

383
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,675
You're coming.

384
00:22:35,368 --> 00:22:37,022
Why didn't you come
out and welcome me?

385
00:22:37,511 --> 00:22:39,688
I'm preparing equipment upstairs.

386
00:22:40,897 --> 00:22:42,737
I have to go to college.

387
00:22:45,466 --> 00:22:47,040
Why does it have to be now?

388
00:22:52,755 --> 00:22:53,964
What's wrong with you?

389
00:22:54,204 --> 00:22:55,644
Why are you upset with me?

390
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,400
I'm so tired today.

391
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,973
There are hard cases
throughout the day.

392
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:04,862
I want to hug you.

393
00:23:05,671 --> 00:23:06,897
But I didn't see you when I came back.

394
00:23:07,635 --> 00:23:09,013
Why wouldn't it frustrate me?

395
00:23:09,671 --> 00:23:10,924
Would you like some orange juice?

396
00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:12,222
I'll make it for you.

397
00:23:12,311 --> 00:23:13,191
Yeah.

398
00:23:14,453 --> 00:23:15,262
Wait a moment.

399
00:23:37,688 --> 00:23:39,493
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

400
00:23:41,502 --> 00:23:42,320
Would you like to hug again?

401
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:44,746
No.

402
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:46,355
I have not showered yet.

403
00:23:47,484 --> 00:23:49,644
I just want to ease your tiredness.

404
00:23:50,177 --> 00:23:51,288
Then...

405
00:24:01,926 --> 00:24:05,120
How can it alleviate my tiredness?

406
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,462
Oh? Tin.

407
00:24:26,462 --> 00:24:28,460
How long have you arrived?

408
00:24:28,728 --> 00:24:30,071
You're so late.

409
00:24:30,773 --> 00:24:32,844
I just bought snacks.
Stop complaining.

410
00:24:33,617 --> 00:24:34,826
Where's the snack?

411
00:24:35,653 --> 00:24:36,613
Can I eat it with you?

412
00:24:40,364 --> 00:24:43,297
Will you join the project
that Tiw invited you to?

413
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,782
Maybe.

414
00:24:44,782 --> 00:24:46,010
It makes money.

415
00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:49,543
Park won't be angry with
you if you stop studying, right?

416
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,080
I haven't told him yet.

417
00:24:52,497 --> 00:24:53,440
What if he scolds you?

418
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:55,671
He wouldn't scold me.

419
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,550
[Sam Khok Hospital]

420
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,290
Park.

421
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:01,813
Huh?

422
00:25:02,115 --> 00:25:03,537
Let's eat today?

423
00:25:05,031 --> 00:25:05,884
No.

424
00:25:06,186 --> 00:25:07,368
I have an appointment with Tin.

425
00:25:07,688 --> 00:25:08,711
I'm late now.

426
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,253
Okay.

427
00:25:09,724 --> 00:25:10,871
See you. Hurry up.

428
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:12,755
Bye bye.

429
00:25:13,502 --> 00:25:16,746
Pimdao, when will your father come?

430
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:18,740
I don't know either.

431
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,897
Just try calling Dad.

432
00:25:21,235 --> 00:25:22,835
I've called.

433
00:25:22,835 --> 00:25:24,830
But your father didn't answer my call.

434
00:25:27,554 --> 00:25:28,772
Oh, Tin.

435
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,186
Stop it.

436
00:25:39,457 --> 00:25:41,324
I have not showered
yet. I'm covered in germs.

437
00:25:46,515 --> 00:25:49,422
Why did you get off work late today?

438
00:25:49,644 --> 00:25:51,564
There were many patients today.

439
00:25:53,057 --> 00:25:54,284
Let's go back home.

440
00:25:59,502 --> 00:26:00,222
Oh?

441
00:26:01,457 --> 00:26:02,480
It's raining.

442
00:26:12,035 --> 00:26:13,377
Are you free on Saturday?

443
00:26:14,017 --> 00:26:15,084
Why?

444
00:26:15,626 --> 00:26:19,360
I work late at night but I'm free
during the day, wanna see a movie?

445
00:26:21,502 --> 00:26:22,755
I can't go.

446
00:26:23,503 --> 00:26:25,609
I have a painting job in other provinces.

447
00:26:26,844 --> 00:26:28,666
I was about to tell you.

448
00:26:29,457 --> 00:26:30,702
It's a big job.

449
00:26:31,831 --> 00:26:33,324
So I had to sleep over there.

450
00:26:33,688 --> 00:26:35,262
It would probably take about 5 days.

451
00:26:39,777 --> 00:26:41,004
5 days?

452
00:26:41,253 --> 00:26:42,915
I go there on Saturday and Sunday.

453
00:26:43,146 --> 00:26:44,320
I'm on leave until Wednesday.

454
00:26:44,968 --> 00:26:46,035
Do you have to skip class?

455
00:26:46,622 --> 00:26:47,973
It's only 3 days.

456
00:26:49,164 --> 00:26:51,964
You can't do it on Saturday
and Sunday, and come back?

457
00:26:52,471 --> 00:26:53,591
No.

458
00:26:53,848 --> 00:26:55,724
I already told them.

459
00:26:56,133 --> 00:26:57,466
Why didn't you tell me first?

460
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:00,906
I get a semester fee
if I complete this job.

461
00:27:01,315 --> 00:27:02,764
I already told you
that I will pay for it.

462
00:27:03,111 --> 00:27:04,702
I already told them.

463
00:27:05,128 --> 00:27:06,302
I have to go anyway.

464
00:27:06,977 --> 00:27:09,475
This work is an opportunity.

465
00:27:10,346 --> 00:27:11,591
If the work results are good,

466
00:27:12,595 --> 00:27:14,275
I may get more work after this.

467
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:20,053
If you don't listen to me, it's over.

468
00:27:27,457 --> 00:27:28,320
Tin!

469
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,822
Tin!

470
00:27:29,937 --> 00:27:31,342
Talk to me first!

471
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:34,995
Tin!

472
00:27:35,733 --> 00:27:37,111
Talk to me!

473
00:27:38,426 --> 00:27:39,288
Tin!

474
00:27:50,008 --> 00:27:51,048
Well, I'll go myself.

475
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,120
I'm sorry.

476
00:28:52,382 --> 00:28:53,822
I should apologize to you too.

477
00:28:54,782 --> 00:28:57,760
I'll tell you next time.

478
00:28:58,266 --> 00:28:59,128
No.

479
00:28:59,528 --> 00:29:01,706
Don't skip class next time.

480
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,342
Okay.

481
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,688
I won't skip class next time.

482
00:29:06,222 --> 00:29:07,911
And...

483
00:29:08,666 --> 00:29:09,084
Huh?

484
00:29:10,356 --> 00:29:12,080
I don't want us to fight again.

485
00:29:12,515 --> 00:29:15,573
I was terrified when
you scolded me harshly.

486
00:29:16,462 --> 00:29:18,044
I was afraid we'd be angry
with each other for a long time.

487
00:29:18,613 --> 00:29:21,120
I don't know what the heart is made of.

488
00:29:21,475 --> 00:29:23,431
But it's fragile.

489
00:29:24,364 --> 00:29:25,111
Well.

490
00:29:25,386 --> 00:29:28,551
The heart is muscular and shaped like...

491
00:29:28,551 --> 00:29:29,974
Park.

492
00:29:30,328 --> 00:29:32,675
I don't want to talk to Wikipedia right now.

493
00:29:33,013 --> 00:29:35,013
I'm just being metaphorical.

494
00:29:35,546 --> 00:29:36,800
I think you want to know it.

495
00:29:37,146 --> 00:29:38,417
I'm bored of science students.

496
00:30:05,902 --> 00:30:07,057
Hello, Park.

497
00:30:07,262 --> 00:30:08,355
I have arrived here.

498
00:30:09,004 --> 00:30:10,737
We thought we'd sleep here.

499
00:30:10,968 --> 00:30:12,311
It's convenient for my work.

500
00:30:13,055 --> 00:30:14,468
I can stay here. It's fine.

501
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,320
It's only 5 days.

502
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:18,106
Please be patient.

503
00:30:20,835 --> 00:30:23,164
I'll hang up. I have to continue working.

504
00:30:31,422 --> 00:30:32,897
Hello, kids.

505
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:33,955
Oh, Boot.

506
00:30:34,062 --> 00:30:34,915
Hello.

507
00:30:34,915 --> 00:30:36,200
- Hello, you all.
- Hello.

508
00:30:36,302 --> 00:30:37,315
Hello, Tiw.

509
00:30:37,315 --> 00:30:37,889
Yes.

510
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,804
Just do as we agreed.

511
00:30:39,902 --> 00:30:40,542
Okay.

512
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:42,540
If there is anything missing, please tell me.

513
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:44,373
Don't be a stranger.

514
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:44,766
Yeah.

515
00:30:44,766 --> 00:30:47,146
If you need anything,
my restaurant staff can help you.

516
00:30:47,146 --> 00:30:48,557
Okay. Thank you.

517
00:30:48,557 --> 00:30:50,556
Please take care of them.

518
00:30:50,556 --> 00:30:50,886
Sure.

519
00:30:50,886 --> 00:30:52,406
I'll go outside.

520
00:30:52,542 --> 00:30:53,031
Okay.

521
00:30:53,048 --> 00:30:53,422
Okay?

522
00:30:53,422 --> 00:30:54,242
Thank you, Tiw.

523
00:30:54,266 --> 00:30:54,871
Yeah.

524
00:31:16,915 --> 00:31:17,822
What's wrong? Tin.

525
00:31:18,231 --> 00:31:19,342
Your face looks sad.

526
00:31:20,622 --> 00:31:22,204
I want to go home.

527
00:31:25,057 --> 00:31:27,066
Just get your work done
if you want to go home.

528
00:31:27,795 --> 00:31:29,831
I don't want to do this job.

529
00:31:30,071 --> 00:31:31,724
Can I go back first?

530
00:31:32,355 --> 00:31:33,626
Don't be fussy.

531
00:31:34,186 --> 00:31:36,702
Just finish your work and you can go home.

532
00:31:37,413 --> 00:31:38,426
Well, guys.

533
00:31:38,817 --> 00:31:39,875
Let's continue to work.

534
00:31:54,586 --> 00:31:55,440
Tin.

535
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,013
Tin.

536
00:31:57,013 --> 00:31:58,029
It's really you.

537
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:00,008
Can you remember me?

538
00:32:02,915 --> 00:32:04,728
You get to do the
work that you love.

539
00:32:05,964 --> 00:32:08,266
You've opened the
restaurant you hoped for too.

540
00:32:08,942 --> 00:32:11,297
You said you always
wanted to run a restaurant.

541
00:32:12,568 --> 00:32:13,893
Do you remember it?

542
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:19,306
How can I not remember?

543
00:32:21,715 --> 00:32:25,840
There are few memories of my mother.

544
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:37,431
You wouldn't have any
difficulty now, would you?

545
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:42,826
It's enough for me to be
able to take care of myself.

546
00:32:43,635 --> 00:32:46,595
My new husband helps and supports me.

547
00:32:47,226 --> 00:32:50,986
I can't open a restaurant by myself.

548
00:32:55,626 --> 00:32:57,573
You probably didn't tell anyone

549
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:00,097
that you had me.

550
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:28,480
Tin.

551
00:33:30,764 --> 00:33:32,702
Here's some money and my new phone number.

552
00:33:33,324 --> 00:33:36,426
If you are in trouble or or having
difficulties, you can always call me.

553
00:33:36,737 --> 00:33:38,897
I'm always glad to help you.

554
00:33:39,155 --> 00:33:40,168
Please take it.

555
00:33:41,306 --> 00:33:42,160
It's okay.

556
00:33:43,253 --> 00:33:44,391
Please take it, dear.

557
00:33:44,533 --> 00:33:45,884
So that I don't feel so bad.

558
00:33:45,937 --> 00:33:46,942
Okay? Please keep it.

559
00:33:47,502 --> 00:33:48,551
It's okay.

560
00:33:49,431 --> 00:33:50,382
Please keep it yourself.

561
00:33:51,804 --> 00:33:52,586
Why?

562
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:53,440
Please take it.

563
00:33:54,986 --> 00:33:55,617
Please?

564
00:33:57,386 --> 00:33:58,897
I don't need money.

565
00:33:59,893 --> 00:34:01,848
I just want an apology from you

566
00:34:02,391 --> 00:34:03,555
that you left me.

567
00:34:06,302 --> 00:34:09,890
You haven't even apologised once.

568
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,675
And this money,

569
00:34:14,284 --> 00:34:16,266
you forced me to take it

570
00:34:17,244 --> 00:34:19,866
so you don't feel guilty.

571
00:34:23,413 --> 00:34:25,671
Did you ever really love me?

572
00:34:28,995 --> 00:34:30,231
Please take it.

573
00:34:36,168 --> 00:34:36,986
Tin!

574
00:35:02,888 --> 00:35:05,484
I missed you so much.

575
00:35:08,542 --> 00:35:09,288
Umm.

576
00:35:09,466 --> 00:35:09,982
Huh?

577
00:35:11,297 --> 00:35:11,980
Park.

578
00:35:12,222 --> 00:35:13,635
What do you have a phone for?

579
00:35:14,382 --> 00:35:16,577
I sent you a message telling
you to buy some delicious food.

580
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:17,946
Why didn't you read it?

581
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,051
I'm starving to death right now.

582
00:35:21,075 --> 00:35:22,577
Let's go. I'll take you
to get something to eat.

583
00:35:23,733 --> 00:35:25,662
If it was something more important,

584
00:35:26,035 --> 00:35:27,511
wouldn't you know about it?

585
00:35:32,044 --> 00:35:32,657
Let's go.

586
00:35:33,137 --> 00:35:34,044
What would you like to eat?

587
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:34,746
Please?

588
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,186
I'll take you to get something to eat.

589
00:35:36,231 --> 00:35:37,075
Park.

590
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,675
I'm serious.

591
00:35:42,994 --> 00:35:44,265
What happened to you?

592
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:47,327
Nothing happened to me.

593
00:35:47,831 --> 00:35:50,900
I just don't like that you
don't read my messages.

594
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:53,490
I want you to answer me all the time.

595
00:35:57,866 --> 00:35:59,546
How can I answer you all the time?

596
00:35:59,697 --> 00:36:00,817
I have to work.

597
00:36:02,346 --> 00:36:04,542
But I want you to answer anyway.

598
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:07,946
Please answer me if you are free.

599
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,577
I want you to be with me all the time.

600
00:36:11,271 --> 00:36:12,826
I can't ask for it?

601
00:36:15,144 --> 00:36:16,238
What happened to you?

602
00:36:17,457 --> 00:36:18,471
Are you angry with me?

603
00:36:20,151 --> 00:36:20,951
No.

604
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,253
I just want to try rampaging once.

605
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:27,168
I'm mad, so I don't know what to do.

606
00:36:28,933 --> 00:36:31,173
Why are you angry with me?

607
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,142
It's like you're chasing me far away.

608
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,271
What's wrong with you?

609
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:41,066
Why didn't you tell me honestly?

610
00:36:44,248 --> 00:36:45,760
I met my mom.

611
00:36:54,577 --> 00:36:56,622
My mom has a new family.

612
00:37:00,044 --> 00:37:01,911
She has a good life.

613
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:07,057
It looked like she
was in no trouble at all.

614
00:37:12,187 --> 00:37:13,592
I hate her.

615
00:37:14,115 --> 00:37:15,768
I hate that she's happy.

616
00:37:24,462 --> 00:37:26,631
I'm very bad, right?

617
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,690
But I don't like that she smiles at me
like she doesn't feel guilty.

618
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,706
I will definitely forgive my mom.

619
00:37:47,964 --> 00:37:49,280
But not today.

620
00:37:56,826 --> 00:37:57,680
It's okay.

621
00:37:59,066 --> 00:38:00,293
It's okay that it's not today.

622
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,253
I know I'll be dumped.

623
00:38:19,768 --> 00:38:21,546
You're not getting dumped.

624
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,515
She would leave me,

625
00:38:26,309 --> 00:38:27,811
so she gave me to you.

626
00:38:29,351 --> 00:38:31,626
It would be nice if
she really dumped you.

627
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,168
Huh?

628
00:38:35,182 --> 00:38:36,711
So that you can be with me forever.

629
00:38:40,213 --> 00:38:41,493
Park...

630
00:38:50,231 --> 00:38:50,835
Babe.

631
00:38:51,226 --> 00:38:51,733
Huh?

632
00:38:52,842 --> 00:38:53,893
Do you want to sleep in my room?

633
00:38:55,582 --> 00:38:57,306
I have to do my homework tonight.

634
00:38:57,715 --> 00:38:58,977
I may not be able to sleep with you.

635
00:38:59,857 --> 00:39:01,697
Just working in my room.

636
00:39:02,568 --> 00:39:04,133
I might do it until late at night.

637
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:06,364
I don't know if I can sleep.

638
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,035
I'm worried that I might bother you too.

639
00:39:08,826 --> 00:39:10,195
I can fall asleep easily.

640
00:39:10,444 --> 00:39:11,955
Don't worry if it will disturb me.

641
00:39:12,773 --> 00:39:13,431
No.

642
00:39:13,671 --> 00:39:15,688
I mean you will disturb me.

643
00:39:15,974 --> 00:39:17,166
I will not finish my work.

644
00:39:19,182 --> 00:39:22,631
But this week we
haven't slept together yet.

645
00:39:23,395 --> 00:39:24,791
Just sleep first.

646
00:39:24,817 --> 00:39:27,439
I'll follow you after I finish my homework.

647
00:39:28,986 --> 00:39:30,035
Alright.

648
00:39:31,013 --> 00:39:33,617
It's not the same right now.

649
00:39:47,013 --> 00:39:48,560
Are you talking to Passorn?

650
00:39:49,093 --> 00:39:49,706
Yeah.

651
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,262
I'm going to sleep.

652
00:39:53,531 --> 00:39:55,486
Don't stay up too late.

653
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:56,960
Okay.

654
00:39:57,262 --> 00:39:58,613
I'll sleep in the morning.

655
00:39:59,342 --> 00:40:00,444
You're stubborn.

656
00:40:40,622 --> 00:40:41,751
Are you done?

657
00:40:42,693 --> 00:40:44,231
Yeah, it's done.

658
00:40:51,564 --> 00:40:52,684
Do you want to say something?

659
00:40:54,835 --> 00:40:55,368
Huh?

660
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,031
Are you kidding me?

661
00:41:15,946 --> 00:41:17,706
I wanted to give it
to you this evening.

662
00:41:19,244 --> 00:41:21,608
But I saw you had a bad experience,

663
00:41:22,808 --> 00:41:23,973
so I kept it.

664
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:27,048
But just now.

665
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:30,408
I woke up and found you,

666
00:41:30,622 --> 00:41:32,124
I want to give it to you right away.

667
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,973
Hold on.

668
00:41:49,395 --> 00:41:51,368
Are you going to propose to me?

669
00:41:54,835 --> 00:41:56,471
You're not romantic at all.

670
00:41:58,533 --> 00:42:01,493
What romance do you want me to have?

671
00:42:05,617 --> 00:42:06,542
It's true.

672
00:42:07,297 --> 00:42:09,164
Just when you buy me a ring,

673
00:42:09,706 --> 00:42:11,200
I'm already surprised.

674
00:42:15,368 --> 00:42:16,915
Because I really want to marry you.

675
00:42:18,711 --> 00:42:22,462
All my life, I only have you.

676
00:42:25,724 --> 00:42:27,377
Whatever I can get,

677
00:42:27,866 --> 00:42:29,555
I want it to be yours.

678
00:42:30,844 --> 00:42:31,786
From now on

679
00:42:32,924 --> 00:42:33,866
if I'm not alive,

680
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,742
I want everything to be yours.

681
00:42:43,804 --> 00:42:44,844
Park...

682
00:42:49,493 --> 00:42:54,462
But now we can't really get married.

683
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:56,986
I would like to be engaged to you first.

684
00:42:59,528 --> 00:43:00,888
The ring is expensive.

685
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:02,302
Please take good care of it.

686
00:43:05,013 --> 00:43:06,071
Sure.

687
00:43:07,164 --> 00:43:09,457
I will take care of it as much as my life.

688
00:43:13,189 --> 00:43:16,993
If the two of us can really get married,

689
00:43:17,686 --> 00:43:19,277
I'll ask you for a proposal again.

690
00:43:22,155 --> 00:43:23,373
I'll wait.

691
00:43:25,795 --> 00:43:27,333
I love you, Park.

692
00:43:30,017 --> 00:43:31,466
I love you too.
