(Tin Tem Jai)
(Episode 3)

2
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:36,711
Isn't it heavy?

3
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,420
It's not heavy.

4
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,670
It's fine.

5
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,300
Just say it's heavy. It has a lot of stuff.

6
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,470
It's chill.

7
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,390
I thought you'd be here longer.

8
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,700
Dad's condition has improved.

9
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,730
He told me to go back to work every day.

10
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,780
When are you coming back here again?

11
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,840
I don't know either.

12
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,110
You can meet me in Bangkok.

13
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,210
I'll take you to taste the famous bubble milk tea.

14
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,460
Okay?

15
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,030
But I don't know how to get there.

16
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,670
I got lost as soon as I left this area.

17
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,350
Are you lost?

18
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,350
You should go to get used to it.

19
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,420
Let's go.

20
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,750
Is it almost finished yet, Dad?

21
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,610
Yes.

22
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,160
Hello, Mom.

23
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,160
Oh, hello.

24
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:38,930
Dad.

25
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,890
I'll go back now.

26
00:02:39,947 --> 00:02:43,237
Pai, I prepared this for you.

27
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,830
Bring it to eat in Bangkok.

28
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,220
Wow, Dad.

29
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,660
I can't finish it.

30
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:48,620
It's too much.

31
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,290
It can last for days if you put it in the fridge.

32
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,870
It won't be crispy soon.

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,300
It's delicious anyway.

34
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,650
Will you take it or not?

35
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,570
If you don't want it, I'll sell it.

36
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,660
I have to force her.

37
00:03:02,023 --> 00:03:03,150
Okay, dad.

38
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,350
I'll take it all.

39
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,490
You said you couldn't finish it.

40
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,620
It's not even enough for you.

41
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,820
The other day you called me
and said you wanted to eat it.

42
00:03:13,007 --> 00:03:14,067
Dad, you're really...

43
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,440
It's you, Pai.

44
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,670
If I finish all of this, I must...

45
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,880
Oh, Pai.

46
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,030
Are you going back to Bangkok?

47
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,260
Yes.

48
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,060
I heard that you renovated the bathroom, right?

49
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,460
To avoid someone slipping in the bathroom.

50
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,490
I already told her not to do it.

51
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,230
It's a waste of money.

52
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,500
If someone dies, no matter
how luxurious the bathroom is, they die.

53
00:03:38,307 --> 00:03:38,807
Hey.

54
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:39,980
Watch your mouth.

55
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,420
Why? You don't want to be a widow?

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,020
If your child wants it, let her do it.

57
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,190
Hey, she rarely takes care of you by your side.

58
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,780
It just spending a little money, right?

59
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,820
Just do it.

60
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,050
Yes.

61
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,170
Just spend a little money.

62
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,370
The total cost is about a hundred thousand baht.

63
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,300
Really?

64
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,210
About a hundred thousand baht.

65
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,720
You can go now.

66
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,100
Go.

67
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,820
I think I'm late.

68
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,110
My dad gave it to you.

69
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,050
Wow.

70
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,020
Why are there so many?

71
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,440
You want me to sell it?

72
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:21,973
He picked them from the garden.

73
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:23,970
Please say thank you to him.

74
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,070
Pai, drive safely.

75
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,600
I know.

76
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,870
Don't be stubborn.

77
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:31,990
OK?

78
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,990
Where is Pao?

79
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,990
He didn't come to say
goodbye to his sister.

80
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,370
Pao slept in,

81
00:04:41,587 --> 00:04:43,967
because last night he prepared
lessons until late at night.

82
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,280
He had to get up early to
go to school Monday-Friday.

83
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,850
I just want him to sleep in on the weekend.

84
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,530
Forget it, grandpa.

85
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:54,870
It's just a goodbye.

86
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:56,656
It's not like I won't
be back here again.

87
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,680
Huh?

88
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,230
Look at you.

89
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,540
Please drink less and take care
of yourself when you get back.

90
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,220
Drinking alcohol often
makes you die faster.

91
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,870
Mom and Dad can't take
care of you if you're sick.

92
00:05:10,946 --> 00:05:12,186
I know, mom.

93
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,490
You always answer like this.

94
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,870
You know everything, but nothing works.

95
00:05:17,955 --> 00:05:18,465
Hey.

96
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:24,380
Don't you remember that I
warned you not to dress sexy?

97
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,870
Don't you know? That it's ugly.

98
00:05:26,387 --> 00:05:27,457
Stop it, mom.

99
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,890
I'm going back today, but
you're still arguing with me.

100
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,436
You said that I was arguing with you
even though I just said this.

101
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,140
I say it because I am your mom.

102
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,830
I warned you to avoid people that your
parents didn't warn you about scolding you.

103
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,060
It's good that you're not here,
otherwise it would be worse.

104
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,700
Stop it. Stop it!

105
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,370
You can go now.

106
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,970
Why are you guys arguing?

107
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:52,692
Tim.

108
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,500
Why?

109
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,520
You can't tell her nicely?

110
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,980
Just go, kiddo.

111
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,300
Drive safely.

112
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,310
I'll go now, grandpa.

113
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,260
- I'll go now, guys.
- Bye.

114
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,600
Bye bye.

115
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
Go. Go.

116
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,490
Drive safely.

117
00:06:12,016 --> 00:06:14,406
Look at her. Look at her!

118
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,890
She forgot it again.

119
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,580
I will bring it to her myself.

120
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:20,741
Good.

121
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,850
Thank you, Tin.

122
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:26,680
Pai.

123
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:27,705
Huh?

124
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:31,749
You forgot to take it with you.

125
00:06:33,103 --> 00:06:34,103
I forgot it.

126
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,580
Thank you, Tin.

127
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,480
Pai.

128
00:06:39,242 --> 00:06:40,292
Are you okay?

129
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,360
How can I not be okay?

130
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,320
I must be a good person.

131
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:49,271
I'm okay.

132
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,320
I'm going to work now.

133
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:54,151
Please take good care of your dad. Okay?

134
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:55,960
Oh.

135
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,210
That.

136
00:06:57,428 --> 00:06:59,408
Dad arrived after we talked about him.

137
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,450
Why do you have to get up early?

138
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,050
Didn't you get off work late last night?

139
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,540
I just came to say goodbye to my girlfriend.

140
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,786
Why won't I say goodbye to you?

141
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,070
Wow.

142
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,390
You're so cute, honey.

143
00:07:13,468 --> 00:07:15,318
But you should take the time to sleep.

144
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,690
Look at you.

145
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,010
I'll go back to sleep.

146
00:07:19,215 --> 00:07:20,561
I just want to say goodbye to you first.

147
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,270
Yeah.

148
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,720
Please let me know when you get there.

149
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,410
Okay.

150
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,460
I'll text you as soon as I arrive.

151
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,500
Even though you know I got there after two days.

152
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
Stop bugging me.

153
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,500
Just call me.

154
00:07:33,544 --> 00:07:33,934
Yeah.

155
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,340
Please put it in the car for me.

156
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:40,460
Done.

157
00:07:40,485 --> 00:07:41,485
Drive safely.

158
00:07:43,612 --> 00:07:45,232
Drive safely, mom.

159
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,050
I will take good care of my dad.

160
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,330
OKAY~

161
00:08:02,852 --> 00:08:03,852
Tin.

162
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,847
When was the last time
you did a number two?

163
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,730
Why are you asking me?

164
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,910
You act like you can't poop.

165
00:08:11,077 --> 00:08:13,358
It's bad for your health to hold your feces like a child.

166
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,860
Your gut will be bad.

167
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,120
It isn't.

168
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:19,315
Stop it.

169
00:08:21,907 --> 00:08:22,907
Park.

170
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,580
Did you ever think about dating Pai?

171
00:08:26,223 --> 00:08:27,223
What's wrong with you?

172
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:29,930
Huh?

173
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,100
She used to tell me things like that.

174
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:35,194
Don't listen to her.

175
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:36,819
It's just her joke.

176
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:40,979
Then you shouldn't call her your girlfriend.

177
00:08:41,925 --> 00:08:43,165
I'm jealous of you.

178
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,790
What the hell do you mean?

179
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,590
Park.

180
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,790
You should only use the word boyfriend with me.

181
00:08:58,874 --> 00:09:01,574
Only me.

182
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,220
You want to get kicked early in the morning.

183
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,600
Come and kick me. Come on.

184
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,320
Where's your kick?

185
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:21,950
Tin.

186
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,740
Huh?

187
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,780
It's ten o'clock already?

188
00:09:52,931 --> 00:09:55,211
I'm totally shocked, Bie.

189
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,980
She is very dedicated to her concert tickets.

190
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,120
You can wake up now!

191
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,780
Wake up!

192
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,780
We have to help Bie book concert tickets.

193
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,050
Give me a second.

194
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,690
Wake up!

195
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,130
It's so comfortable.

196
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,700
Hey.

197
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,610
What the hell are you doing?

198
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,220
I told you to give me a second.

199
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,390
You keep bothering me.

200
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,150
It's the weekend. Can't I wake up late?

201
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,980
Okay, I'll give you ten minutes.

202
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,220
Ten minutes is okay.

203
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,540
I promise.

204
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,100
Let me go now!

205
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,450
Just wait ten minutes.

206
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,880
I'll let you go.

207
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:14,380
One concert ticket, you make
the entire community tired.

208
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,190
Hey, Kana.

209
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:19,500
If it makes you tired, just go back
and help your mother sell eggs.

210
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,500
You don't need to help me.

211
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,370
Hey, without me, you'll regret it.

212
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,390
I booked tickets last time.

213
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,230
It's just one time.

214
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,450
Last time, Park was able to book tickets as well.

215
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:31,610
Yes.

216
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,156
And if I can book a ticket this time?

217
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:33,970
You can't do it.

218
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:34,970
I can!

219
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,930
But where is Park?

220
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,030
Park is here!

221
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,540
Hey, why are you late?

222
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,540
I went to buy steamed buns.

223
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,270
Actually, you can go to sleep.

224
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,720
You rarely get rest.

225
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,490
It's okay.

226
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:51,650
I'm free today.

227
00:11:52,077 --> 00:11:53,077
Why are you free?

228
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:54,771
I alternate working days.

229
00:11:55,277 --> 00:11:56,437
I already told you, didn't I?

230
00:11:56,735 --> 00:11:57,802
You didn't.

231
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,540
Alright.

232
00:11:59,988 --> 00:12:01,331
I'm telling you right now.

233
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,166
Here.

234
00:12:06,104 --> 00:12:06,895
Calm down.

235
00:12:07,073 --> 00:12:08,073
It smells good.

236
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,020
It's so yummy!

237
00:12:12,255 --> 00:12:13,255
It's hot.

238
00:12:14,504 --> 00:12:15,704
Does it have red pork filling?

239
00:12:15,828 --> 00:12:16,828
Here.

240
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:18,486
I want it! I'll eat it.

241
00:12:19,846 --> 00:12:21,304
I'll eat red pork filling!

242
00:12:22,771 --> 00:12:24,193
Stop! None of you will eat it.

243
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:25,877
I'll eat it.

244
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,400
Hey! 5 more minutes!

245
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Get ready!

246
00:12:29,633 --> 00:12:30,726
Hurry up!

247
00:12:31,402 --> 00:12:32,402
Give it to me!

248
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:35,319
Hurry up, Pao!

249
00:12:36,566 --> 00:12:38,006
I have to successfully book tickets!

250
00:12:38,406 --> 00:12:40,202
Bie must treat me to a meal.

251
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:45,348
I'm okay with all zones.

252
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,900
You can choose any row, just book it.

253
00:12:49,073 --> 00:12:50,620
Hey, it's time!

254
00:12:52,957 --> 00:12:53,633
10!

255
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:54,539
9!

256
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:55,206
8!

257
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:56,506
7!

258
00:12:56,619 --> 00:12:57,619
6!

259
00:12:58,035 --> 00:12:59,035
5!

260
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:00,621
4!

261
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:01,699
3!

262
00:13:02,021 --> 00:13:03,021
2!

263
00:13:03,257 --> 00:13:03,932
1!

264
00:13:04,046 --> 00:13:05,059
Book it!

265
00:13:05,263 --> 00:13:06,263
Bie!

266
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,175
Which zone?

267
00:13:07,175 --> 00:13:08,259
Any zone!

268
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:09,441
What row?

269
00:13:09,726 --> 00:13:11,059
Any row!

270
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,396
Hey, I'm getting an error!

271
00:13:20,414 --> 00:13:20,965
Hey.

272
00:13:20,983 --> 00:13:21,983
It's an error.

273
00:13:22,619 --> 00:13:23,619
Hey.

274
00:13:23,827 --> 00:13:24,827
Is the web page down?

275
00:13:25,063 --> 00:13:25,809
Hey.

276
00:13:25,863 --> 00:13:27,418
Why isn't it loading?

277
00:13:29,223 --> 00:13:30,938
Does this mean I can book tickets?

278
00:13:32,503 --> 00:13:33,711
Hey, Park!

279
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,956
Hey! You got the golden zone!

280
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:38,249
Hey.

281
00:13:38,414 --> 00:13:39,551
Don't fail, please.

282
00:13:39,907 --> 00:13:40,907
Park, hold on.

283
00:13:41,596 --> 00:13:43,418
Press to confirm the order.

284
00:13:43,418 --> 00:13:45,413
Hey, I have to confirm.

285
00:13:45,413 --> 00:13:46,175
Don't fail, please.

286
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
Calm down.

287
00:13:48,214 --> 00:13:49,443
I got it! Park!

288
00:13:49,803 --> 00:13:52,440
I love you the most, Park!

289
00:13:53,383 --> 00:13:55,009
Guys, clap your hands!

290
00:13:58,903 --> 00:14:00,911
I'll treat you to a meal today.

291
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:02,903
You've got a day off anyway.

292
00:14:03,871 --> 00:14:05,151
Do you only treat food for Park?

293
00:14:05,231 --> 00:14:06,231
What about us?

294
00:14:07,489 --> 00:14:09,214
Yes, including all of you.

295
00:14:09,845 --> 00:14:10,845
Let's go together, Pao.

296
00:14:11,178 --> 00:14:11,676
Okay?

297
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:12,494
Sure.

298
00:14:12,689 --> 00:14:13,689
I'm free today.

299
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,663
I got it now.

300
00:14:15,663 --> 00:14:16,956
You should have free time.

301
00:14:19,578 --> 00:14:22,076
Well, you should go back to sleep, Park.

302
00:14:22,334 --> 00:14:23,943
See you in the evening.

303
00:14:25,036 --> 00:14:26,036
Yeah.

304
00:14:26,316 --> 00:14:27,316
Let's back home.

305
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:28,951
Is it done?

306
00:14:28,983 --> 00:14:30,120
Yes.

307
00:14:30,191 --> 00:14:30,713
You got it now?

308
00:14:30,713 --> 00:14:32,263
Yes, let's go back.

309
00:14:32,263 --> 00:14:33,871
Kana, you're so chatty.

310
00:14:34,494 --> 00:14:36,245
It was easier last time.

311
00:14:48,373 --> 00:14:49,373
What's up with you?

312
00:14:50,614 --> 00:14:51,614
Oh.

313
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:55,532
I saw many bodies last night.

314
00:14:56,321 --> 00:14:57,477
It's stuck in my head.

315
00:15:09,978 --> 00:15:11,658
You've been working for so many years,

316
00:15:11,683 --> 00:15:12,957
you haven't gotten used to it?

317
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:18,609
If I got used to other people's deaths,
wouldn't that mean something is wrong with me?

318
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,160
Was it an accident?

319
00:15:21,473 --> 00:15:22,473
Yeah.

320
00:15:23,265 --> 00:15:27,710
Last night, a baby who couldn't talk yet

321
00:15:28,229 --> 00:15:29,517
became an orphan.

322
00:15:30,271 --> 00:15:32,778
The baby lost both parents.

323
00:15:33,226 --> 00:15:36,657
I can't even imagine
the life of that baby.

324
00:15:37,846 --> 00:15:40,566
I've been thinking about it all night
but still can't figure it out.

325
00:15:41,445 --> 00:15:45,418
Maybe someone will adopt the kid.

326
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:50,259
Relatives, siblings or neighbors.

327
00:15:51,114 --> 00:15:52,820
Like how you take good care of me.

328
00:15:55,728 --> 00:15:57,844
You're worried about me, right?

329
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,030
I hate you.

330
00:16:03,201 --> 00:16:05,681
You always say you hate me
every time you can't argue with me.

331
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I hate that you know me well.

332
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:13,415
I'm always in your heart.

333
00:16:15,698 --> 00:16:18,623
You seem to want to get kicked every day.

334
00:16:18,648 --> 00:16:19,648
Aren't you tired?

335
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:25,042
If it's you, I'm okay with being
kicked for the rest of my life.

336
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,330
Stop bugging me.

337
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,615
Just sleep.

338
00:16:32,713 --> 00:16:33,184
Yeah.

339
00:16:33,424 --> 00:16:34,704
I'll wake you up in the evening.

340
00:16:34,873 --> 00:16:35,406
Okay.

341
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:36,619
I'm going to do laundry.

342
00:16:38,704 --> 00:16:39,704
Hey.

343
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:42,855
Can't you do the laundry tomorrow?

344
00:16:44,935 --> 00:16:45,935
Why?

345
00:16:47,086 --> 00:16:50,259
I have something I want you to do.

346
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,784
What do you want me to do?

347
00:16:55,095 --> 00:16:55,681
Huh?

348
00:16:56,028 --> 00:16:57,317
I can't ask you to do anything?

349
00:16:59,388 --> 00:17:01,388
Just tell me nicely.

350
00:17:02,757 --> 00:17:04,144
I will do whatever you ask.

351
00:17:07,077 --> 00:17:08,077
You...

352
00:17:10,126 --> 00:17:11,450
Can you stay with me?

353
00:17:13,877 --> 00:17:15,637
I can stay with you for the rest of my life.

354
00:17:21,726 --> 00:17:22,828
Let's sleep.

355
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:25,317
I'll...

356
00:17:31,433 --> 00:17:32,686
I'll cover you with a blanket.

357
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:36,099
Just lean back.

358
00:17:50,295 --> 00:17:51,513
Stay with me.

359
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:54,561
I can stay with you for the rest of my life.

360
00:18:02,224 --> 00:18:03,984
I'll be right here.

361
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,130
I'll be here until you fall asleep.

362
00:18:10,062 --> 00:18:11,062
Okay?

363
00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:12,779
Yeah.

364
00:18:43,301 --> 00:18:44,503
Why? Kana.

365
00:18:47,107 --> 00:18:50,112
Your mom asked you to take care of her,
can you do it?

366
00:18:50,586 --> 00:18:51,812
She went outside for a moment.

367
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:53,972
Why me?

368
00:18:54,356 --> 00:18:55,565
Just complain to your mom.

369
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,539
Don't shoot the messenger.

370
00:19:00,795 --> 00:19:05,506
Mom was never with me when I asked her.

371
00:19:06,366 --> 00:19:07,366
I don't know.

372
00:19:08,917 --> 00:19:11,305
Manow, you can play with Tin.

373
00:19:11,624 --> 00:19:12,624
Okay.

374
00:19:13,412 --> 00:19:14,932
You can go now, I'll take care of her.

375
00:19:14,957 --> 00:19:15,957
Okay.

376
00:19:23,742 --> 00:19:24,742
Right here.

377
00:19:25,616 --> 00:19:26,616
Inside here.

378
00:19:28,056 --> 00:19:31,748
I'll find an empty seat for you.

379
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,559
Sit over there with your friend, Manow.

380
00:19:34,904 --> 00:19:35,904
Go!

381
00:19:38,248 --> 00:19:39,590
Are your drawings almost finished?

382
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,004
Yes.

383
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:46,220
Beam, I want to use blue color after you finish using it.

384
00:19:46,245 --> 00:19:47,847
You can use other colors while waiting for me.

385
00:19:48,218 --> 00:19:50,334
No, I want to paint the sky.

386
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:52,252
I have to use blue for the sky.

387
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:56,007
Who said that the sky had to be only blue?

388
00:19:56,552 --> 00:19:58,837
Yes, we can color anything in our drawing.

389
00:19:59,303 --> 00:20:02,014
Tin, does the sky need to be only blue?

390
00:20:02,876 --> 00:20:05,703
I can't use other colors?

391
00:20:06,023 --> 00:20:07,023
I think so.

392
00:20:07,597 --> 00:20:09,988
Can we paint another color for the sky?

393
00:20:11,073 --> 00:20:15,100
No one said that the
sky had to be blue only.

394
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,295
You can color anything.

395
00:20:17,664 --> 00:20:19,993
It depends on your imagination.

396
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:26,882
Your sky can be red, yellow, orange, or even pink.

397
00:20:41,817 --> 00:20:44,786
You can go home after you finish drawing.

398
00:20:45,339 --> 00:20:47,232
See you again next week.

399
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:48,193
Okay?

400
00:20:48,383 --> 00:20:49,779
Okay.

401
00:20:51,165 --> 00:20:51,592
Let's go.

402
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,768
You can leave your drawing
supplies; I'll clean up.

403
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:55,713
Bye.

404
00:20:55,813 --> 00:20:56,409
Thank you.

405
00:20:56,413 --> 00:20:57,775
Good bye.

406
00:20:57,855 --> 00:20:58,975
Bye.

407
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:00,868
Get back home safely, kiddo.

408
00:21:00,877 --> 00:21:01,677
Yes, bye.

409
00:21:01,704 --> 00:21:02,704
Bye bye.

410
00:21:11,177 --> 00:21:12,161
What are you drawing?

411
00:21:12,793 --> 00:21:14,068
I'm drawing the ground.

412
00:21:14,095 --> 00:21:15,175
Are you drawing the ground?

413
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:17,979
You have to paint like this.

414
00:21:24,521 --> 00:21:25,521
Here.

415
00:21:35,766 --> 00:21:36,433
Hey!

416
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:37,433
Name. Donut.

417
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:40,480
You guys came to watch the movie?

418
00:21:40,504 --> 00:21:41,784
I might come here to do laundry.

419
00:21:42,824 --> 00:21:43,904
What the hell was that?

420
00:21:44,273 --> 00:21:46,797
Kana, you should be respectful.

421
00:21:48,593 --> 00:21:49,593
Are you close with them?

422
00:21:50,273 --> 00:21:51,473
Hey, I'm sorry.

423
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:53,997
You guys scold me.

424
00:21:54,548 --> 00:21:56,726
What are you guys doing here?

425
00:21:56,921 --> 00:21:58,104
Are you guys dating?

426
00:21:58,308 --> 00:22:00,188
I just came to watch a movie with my boyfriend.

427
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:02,930
You watch movies with your boyfriend.

428
00:22:02,984 --> 00:22:03,984
That's it.

429
00:22:04,379 --> 00:22:07,988
I also want to watch a movie with my boyfriend together.

430
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:12,486
But I don't have a boyfriend.

431
00:22:13,561 --> 00:22:14,561
I will kick you.

432
00:22:15,704 --> 00:22:17,384
I'll go watch the movie now.

433
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,566
It's time.

434
00:22:19,899 --> 00:22:20,899
Yeah.

435
00:22:22,993 --> 00:22:24,308
See you at this table.

436
00:22:25,357 --> 00:22:26,877
Let's choose our food.

437
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,050
Okay.

438
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,619
I reserved a seat here.

439
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,099
I reserved a seat here.

440
00:22:32,688 --> 00:22:33,448
Just sit it.

441
00:22:33,473 --> 00:22:34,473
It's your business.

442
00:22:36,753 --> 00:22:39,801
I want dumplings and meatballs.

443
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:41,553
You want 1 set, right?

444
00:22:41,553 --> 00:22:42,553
Yes.

445
00:22:45,917 --> 00:22:46,563
Your food is ready.

446
00:22:46,563 --> 00:22:47,563
Thank you.

447
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:52,868
Your card is 10 baht short.

448
00:22:53,499 --> 00:22:54,499
Oh...

449
00:22:55,739 --> 00:22:58,157
You can use mine.

450
00:22:58,228 --> 00:22:59,228
Okay.

451
00:23:06,513 --> 00:23:08,006
You owe me 10 baht.

452
00:23:08,433 --> 00:23:09,143
Thank you.

453
00:23:09,143 --> 00:23:10,628
I need one more set.

454
00:23:10,761 --> 00:23:11,761
Okay.

455
00:23:15,526 --> 00:23:17,330
I'll go get the money from my table for you.

456
00:23:18,201 --> 00:23:19,419
Hey, it's okay.

457
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:20,890
I'm just kidding.

458
00:23:21,597 --> 00:23:23,428
No, I have to give it back to you.

459
00:23:25,677 --> 00:23:28,850
Then I'll have one of your shrimp meatballs.

460
00:23:33,503 --> 00:23:34,503
Here.

461
00:23:34,717 --> 00:23:36,184
I give you 10 baht per piece.

462
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:40,544
Enjoy your meal.

463
00:23:48,893 --> 00:23:50,459
Wow.

464
00:23:53,615 --> 00:23:55,064
Who were you talking to, Tin?

465
00:23:55,784 --> 00:23:57,988
You can't stop smiling.

466
00:24:00,495 --> 00:24:01,739
I don't know him either.

467
00:24:01,953 --> 00:24:02,953
Huh?

468
00:24:03,997 --> 00:24:06,779
Park said you shouldn't
talk to strangers, right?

469
00:24:07,597 --> 00:24:09,890
Otherwise, you might get kidnapped.

470
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:12,886
I know.

471
00:24:14,281 --> 00:24:15,281
Hey, Tin.

472
00:24:15,784 --> 00:24:17,881
You smile, do you like him?

473
00:24:18,742 --> 00:24:20,093
Hey, crazy.

474
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:21,113
Don't say that.

475
00:24:21,233 --> 00:24:22,933
Park will get jealous of me.

476
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:27,988
His card needed another
10 baht, so I paid for him.

477
00:24:28,575 --> 00:24:31,206
I traded it for this meatball.

478
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,570
Here.

479
00:24:33,633 --> 00:24:34,753
The meatballs look so yummy.

480
00:24:35,117 --> 00:24:36,117
Can I eat it?

481
00:24:37,126 --> 00:24:37,773
No.

482
00:24:38,121 --> 00:24:39,401
There's only one.

483
00:24:40,975 --> 00:24:42,148
You can't give it to me?

484
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:44,086
Alright, I'll give it to you.

485
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,824
Is it delicious?

486
00:24:54,575 --> 00:24:56,175
Park.

487
00:24:56,735 --> 00:25:00,041
Don't you feel anything if someone likes Tin?

488
00:25:01,704 --> 00:25:03,793
I thought of asking you many times.

489
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:06,530
Tin flirts with you every day.

490
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:08,530
You don't feel anything?

491
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:12,277
I feel...

492
00:25:15,953 --> 00:25:17,455
I feel annoyed.

493
00:25:19,713 --> 00:25:23,423
Don't you feel shaken, hesitant,
heart fluttering, wanting to...?

494
00:25:23,448 --> 00:25:24,448
Eat your food.

495
00:25:25,784 --> 00:25:27,570
I'm just asking you.

496
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:45,628
Hey.

497
00:25:45,721 --> 00:25:46,833
Where are you going?

498
00:25:47,864 --> 00:25:49,339
Isn't school closed today?

499
00:25:50,201 --> 00:25:51,401
I bought something for my dad.

500
00:25:52,726 --> 00:25:54,446
Materials have been out
of stock since yesterday.

501
00:25:54,477 --> 00:25:55,477
I haven't bought it yet.

502
00:25:55,828 --> 00:25:57,748
Why didn't you buy yesterday?

503
00:25:58,415 --> 00:26:00,024
I took you guys to the movies yesterday.

504
00:26:03,268 --> 00:26:04,548
I want to go to market with you.

505
00:26:05,979 --> 00:26:06,979
You're not at your shop?

506
00:26:08,228 --> 00:26:08,681
I'm not.

507
00:26:09,188 --> 00:26:10,188
I hate it.

508
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,561
I can help you carry things.

509
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:14,339
What's wrong with you?

510
00:26:16,406 --> 00:26:17,161
Nothing.

511
00:26:17,384 --> 00:26:19,241
I just want to be with you.

512
00:26:20,397 --> 00:26:21,397
Let's go.

513
00:26:23,739 --> 00:26:24,739
Ouch!

514
00:26:35,526 --> 00:26:36,526
Heavy.

515
00:26:39,937 --> 00:26:40,979
Let me go.

516
00:26:41,437 --> 00:26:42,437
You're very heavy.

517
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:53,268
Oh, Tin?

518
00:26:54,015 --> 00:26:55,135
Happy birthday.

519
00:26:55,295 --> 00:26:57,721
How did you remember?

520
00:26:57,828 --> 00:26:58,828
Thank you.

521
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,806
How could she not remember?

522
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,037
She gave you snacks since you were so small.

523
00:27:04,753 --> 00:27:06,744
You can pick anything in the store.

524
00:27:06,797 --> 00:27:08,477
Please think of it as my birthday present.

525
00:27:09,108 --> 00:27:10,108
Mom!

526
00:27:10,201 --> 00:27:11,250
How can you say that?

527
00:27:11,686 --> 00:27:14,148
What would we do if he took the whole store?

528
00:27:14,859 --> 00:27:16,637
Don't blame him.

529
00:27:18,593 --> 00:27:20,015
I want to eat too.

530
00:27:20,566 --> 00:27:21,566
Alright.

531
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:24,575
Today you can pick up anything you want.

532
00:27:27,632 --> 00:27:28,632
Hey!

533
00:27:29,339 --> 00:27:31,410
It's for sale.

534
00:27:42,084 --> 00:27:43,084
Bie.

535
00:27:43,837 --> 00:27:46,957
Does your name mean Barbie or Zombie?

536
00:27:47,455 --> 00:27:48,753
You look exhausted.

537
00:27:49,881 --> 00:27:52,264
I don't have the energy to argue with you today, Kana.

538
00:27:53,161 --> 00:27:54,530
I have a stomach ache.

539
00:27:55,659 --> 00:27:56,659
What happened?

540
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:58,299
What happened to your ears?

541
00:27:58,788 --> 00:28:00,293
I said I had a stomach ache.

542
00:28:00,664 --> 00:28:02,735
I'd buy it for you, but you said no.

543
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:04,019
You're fussy.

544
00:28:05,064 --> 00:28:07,184
You'll pick the wrong
thing if I let you buy for me.

545
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,464
Just choose your favorite snack.

546
00:28:13,215 --> 00:28:14,215
This one.

547
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:16,233
Thank you.

548
00:28:17,384 --> 00:28:19,641
Kana, I pick this. The money is with Bie.

549
00:28:19,834 --> 00:28:20,834
Okay.

550
00:28:25,855 --> 00:28:29,375
Bie, you're so manly but you're on your period?

551
00:28:30,895 --> 00:28:31,895
Of course.

552
00:28:32,299 --> 00:28:34,184
You don't study hard, so you're stupid.

553
00:28:34,699 --> 00:28:36,095
Hey, stop.

554
00:28:38,024 --> 00:28:40,403
Stop.
You two are always fighting!

555
00:28:41,793 --> 00:28:42,403
Tin.

556
00:28:42,403 --> 00:28:44,043
What would you like to eat in particular?

557
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,370
Are you okay, Bie?

558
00:28:48,575 --> 00:28:49,575
I'm okay with everything.

559
00:28:49,659 --> 00:28:50,859
It doesn't have to be special.

560
00:28:51,844 --> 00:28:52,573
No.

561
00:28:52,573 --> 00:28:53,917
It's your birthday.

562
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:56,415
Let's go find something at the market to eat?

563
00:28:56,726 --> 00:28:58,788
And go buy things to make grilled pork together.

564
00:28:59,144 --> 00:29:00,144
Let's go.

565
00:29:01,286 --> 00:29:01,753
I want to go with you guys too.

566
00:29:01,753 --> 00:29:02,753
It's not your business.

567
00:29:03,165 --> 00:29:04,165
Kana!

568
00:29:06,815 --> 00:29:07,917
Stand there.

569
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:17,784
Park. Let's eat together?

570
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,455
I can't go with you.

571
00:29:19,499 --> 00:29:20,499
I have an appointment.

572
00:29:20,646 --> 00:29:21,646
Really?

573
00:29:23,037 --> 00:29:25,401
You don't want to eat with me?

574
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:29,037
No.

575
00:29:29,428 --> 00:29:32,264
I have an appointment with an important person.

576
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:33,606
So I have to hurry back.

577
00:29:34,717 --> 00:29:36,357
Make an appointment with your girlfriend?

578
00:29:37,713 --> 00:29:38,713
That's not it.

579
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,593
He is my younger brother.

580
00:29:43,455 --> 00:29:45,473
So you should hurry back.

581
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:46,970
I have to go back now.

582
00:29:47,295 --> 00:29:49,268
I'll have dinner with you later.

583
00:29:49,784 --> 00:29:50,784
Sure.

584
00:29:52,477 --> 00:29:52,975
I'll go now.

585
00:29:53,135 --> 00:29:54,415
Okay, drive safely.

586
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:54,930
Yeah.

587
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:56,655
Let's eat. Go!

588
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:08,824
It's here.

589
00:30:09,446 --> 00:30:13,704
Roast duck and crispy pork
from Tong and Tim's restaurant.

590
00:30:16,424 --> 00:30:17,424
Can I eat now?

591
00:30:18,261 --> 00:30:18,963
Hey.

592
00:30:18,963 --> 00:30:19,401
Why?

593
00:30:19,597 --> 00:30:20,637
You need to wait for Park.

594
00:30:22,593 --> 00:30:23,748
I'm hungry.

595
00:30:25,855 --> 00:30:26,984
Please grill it for me, Bie.

596
00:30:28,157 --> 00:30:29,157
Just do it yourself.

597
00:30:30,086 --> 00:30:32,095
It's right in front of you. Grab it and grill it.

598
00:30:32,984 --> 00:30:34,093
You don't have hands?

599
00:30:34,486 --> 00:30:36,797
I'll feed you if you don't have hands.

600
00:30:38,352 --> 00:30:39,385
It has all the nutrients.

601
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,170
I'm suddenly deaf.

602
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:46,468
It's here.

603
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:48,103
Whose cake is this?

604
00:30:48,103 --> 00:30:49,259
Here.

605
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:53,864
Come on. Let's sing Happy Birthday to Tin.

606
00:30:54,006 --> 00:30:54,521
Yes.

607
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:56,513
1, 2, 3!

608
00:30:56,753 --> 00:31:01,010
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

609
00:31:01,321 --> 00:31:05,535
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

610
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:09,624
♪ Happy birthday, happy birthday ♪

611
00:31:09,704 --> 00:31:13,428
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

612
00:31:14,201 --> 00:31:16,317
Wow.

613
00:31:19,481 --> 00:31:21,010
What is your wish?

614
00:31:21,908 --> 00:31:24,163
A toy? Sure.

615
00:31:24,163 --> 00:31:24,921
Okay.

616
00:31:25,028 --> 00:31:27,028
Let's eat cake?

617
00:31:27,108 --> 00:31:28,575
Let's cut the cake, shall we?

618
00:31:31,503 --> 00:31:32,503
Oh, Park.

619
00:31:32,663 --> 00:31:33,663
You're back?

620
00:31:37,863 --> 00:31:38,303
Hey!

621
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,183
Ouch!

622
00:31:39,183 --> 00:31:40,183
What happened?

623
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:45,133
I bumped into the chair.

624
00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:46,579
Huh?

625
00:31:47,037 --> 00:31:48,333
Is the chair okay?

626
00:31:49,543 --> 00:31:51,233
Park!

627
00:31:51,753 --> 00:31:53,943
I'm really hurt.

628
00:31:54,443 --> 00:31:57,853
Look, I'm really hurt.

629
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:02,013
Can you blow on it for me?

630
00:32:02,051 --> 00:32:04,101
How can I blow? That's your foot.

631
00:32:05,363 --> 00:32:06,363
Stop there.

632
00:32:07,723 --> 00:32:08,763
Don't be fussy.

633
00:32:11,643 --> 00:32:12,643
Park.

634
00:32:13,293 --> 00:32:14,623
Did you buy the cake?

635
00:32:14,623 --> 00:32:15,623
Oh.

636
00:32:16,863 --> 00:32:17,943
It's on the motorcycle.

637
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:37,913
Oh.

638
00:32:40,313 --> 00:32:41,593
Is it my gift?

639
00:32:43,913 --> 00:32:45,553
I'll pretend not to see it.

640
00:32:46,193 --> 00:32:48,143
Otherwise, Park's surprise plan will be ruined.

641
00:32:58,993 --> 00:33:00,323
I'm better now.

642
00:33:00,463 --> 00:33:04,783
Kana bought me some medicine.

643
00:33:06,323 --> 00:33:07,323
Hey.

644
00:33:07,623 --> 00:33:09,313
He called you, right?

645
00:33:10,663 --> 00:33:11,753
Kana?

646
00:33:13,323 --> 00:33:13,863
Yes!

647
00:33:14,343 --> 00:33:15,343
It's me. Why?

648
00:33:26,453 --> 00:33:27,453
Wow.

649
00:33:27,983 --> 00:33:29,093
Orange cake again.

650
00:33:29,853 --> 00:33:33,403
Whenever I tell Park to buy cakes,
he always buys orange cakes.

651
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:35,053
It's delicious.

652
00:33:35,523 --> 00:33:38,073
You have to say it's delicious when you like it.

653
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:41,643
If you don't eat it,

654
00:33:42,163 --> 00:33:43,163
I'll eat it myself.

655
00:33:44,263 --> 00:33:45,473
Oh, Park!

656
00:33:45,483 --> 00:33:45,933
Huh?

657
00:33:46,343 --> 00:33:47,343
What's in the bag?

658
00:33:47,723 --> 00:33:49,313
The bag is beautiful.

659
00:33:52,373 --> 00:33:53,873
Candles and lighters.

660
00:33:54,573 --> 00:33:55,573
Huh?

661
00:33:56,233 --> 00:33:58,333
Why do you have to put it in a pretty bag?

662
00:33:59,263 --> 00:34:01,363
It's a shop bag.

663
00:34:02,053 --> 00:34:03,053
What's wrong with you?

664
00:34:03,603 --> 00:34:05,263
I think...

665
00:34:07,573 --> 00:34:08,683
Forget it.

666
00:34:17,153 --> 00:34:19,903
Look at this. I got a lot of gifts this year.

667
00:34:20,843 --> 00:34:22,623
This is a mango from Uncle Manop.

668
00:34:25,801 --> 00:34:28,781
This is Pink and Name's new brush.

669
00:34:39,963 --> 00:34:43,593
And roast duck from Uncle Tong and Aunt Tim.

670
00:34:44,818 --> 00:34:48,518
These are snacks from
Aunt Mam and Uncle Kai.

671
00:34:51,613 --> 00:34:52,713
This one

672
00:34:54,163 --> 00:34:55,163
is mine.

673
00:34:58,163 --> 00:34:59,163
Oh.

674
00:35:02,795 --> 00:35:05,485
I don't know if you will like it.

675
00:35:07,013 --> 00:35:08,293
It's probably not a doll, right?

676
00:35:08,443 --> 00:35:11,093
Hey, no. You're an adult.

677
00:35:11,393 --> 00:35:12,633
Who will give you a doll?

678
00:35:13,983 --> 00:35:14,983
What is this?

679
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:17,753
Hey!

680
00:35:19,973 --> 00:35:21,893
Isn't it too expensive, Pao?

681
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,183
Pai and I split the cost.

682
00:35:24,773 --> 00:35:25,773
Do you like it?

683
00:35:27,653 --> 00:35:28,653
Wow...

684
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:31,597
Pao and Pai are really dedicated.

685
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:33,793
What else is my gift worth?

686
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:37,253
I like everything you guys bought for me.

687
00:35:37,653 --> 00:35:38,833
But I don't want a doll.

688
00:35:39,323 --> 00:35:41,083
I know that you don't like it.

689
00:35:42,043 --> 00:35:43,433
Here.

690
00:35:43,943 --> 00:35:46,203
I didn't wrap it for environmental reasons.

691
00:35:50,613 --> 00:35:51,613
Hey!

692
00:35:54,113 --> 00:35:57,213
I'm really wanted this shirt.

693
00:35:58,513 --> 00:36:00,503
I saw you shared it in your story.

694
00:36:00,943 --> 00:36:01,943
So I bought it for you.

695
00:36:15,281 --> 00:36:16,281
Kana.

696
00:36:17,783 --> 00:36:19,823
I have no job and no income.

697
00:36:19,823 --> 00:36:21,503
How would I get
money to buy you gifts?

698
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,770
I don't want anything from you.

699
00:36:30,803 --> 00:36:32,763
If you don't want it...

700
00:36:33,883 --> 00:36:34,883
Here.

701
00:36:36,213 --> 00:36:37,213
Just take it.

702
00:36:38,173 --> 00:36:39,213
I intend to do it for you.

703
00:36:48,903 --> 00:36:49,903
Thank you.

704
00:36:50,443 --> 00:36:51,883
I don't think you'll give me a gift.

705
00:36:54,073 --> 00:36:55,793
I don't think you can say thank you either.

706
00:36:56,243 --> 00:36:57,443
I have manners.

707
00:36:58,173 --> 00:36:59,173
Do you have manners?

708
00:36:59,863 --> 00:37:00,453
Why?

709
00:37:00,453 --> 00:37:00,793
Huh?

710
00:37:00,933 --> 00:37:01,613
And why?

711
00:37:01,763 --> 00:37:02,763
Stop it!

712
00:37:06,603 --> 00:37:07,603
Sit down.

713
00:37:32,103 --> 00:37:33,743
Hold on, Park.

714
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:36,120
Let me fix this up.

715
00:37:48,423 --> 00:37:50,423
You won't take a shower?

716
00:37:51,133 --> 00:37:52,363
I can't get up.

717
00:37:54,443 --> 00:37:56,323
So do you want me to change your shirt for you?

718
00:37:56,473 --> 00:37:58,683
Hey, no.

719
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:01,633
You're harassing me.

720
00:38:02,643 --> 00:38:04,113
Who would do that to you?

721
00:38:06,873 --> 00:38:08,763
It's you first.

722
00:38:09,013 --> 00:38:10,353
So, you'll just
sleep smelling bad.

723
00:38:30,073 --> 00:38:32,033
Park! I'm shocked.

724
00:38:32,203 --> 00:38:33,203
Why?

725
00:38:34,183 --> 00:38:35,433
I have something to ask you.

726
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:38,993
Why don't you like dolls?

727
00:38:40,053 --> 00:38:41,593
That's what you want to ask?

728
00:38:41,813 --> 00:38:42,813
Yes.

729
00:38:43,473 --> 00:38:44,473
Why?

730
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:46,313
I'm an adult now.

731
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:49,344
Also, I can't do anything with dolls.

732
00:38:50,533 --> 00:38:53,353
But it's cute. You should like it.

733
00:38:54,193 --> 00:38:55,623
Why should I like it?

734
00:38:56,588 --> 00:38:57,928
It's because I bought it!

735
00:38:59,693 --> 00:39:00,693
You keep saying it

736
00:39:00,693 --> 00:39:02,653
that you don't like dolls.

737
00:39:03,783 --> 00:39:05,183
I feel bad.

738
00:39:06,203 --> 00:39:07,773
I choose it with my heart.

739
00:39:18,933 --> 00:39:19,993
I like it.

740
00:39:21,783 --> 00:39:22,903
You didn't say...

741
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:39,333
Here.

742
00:39:40,063 --> 00:39:41,533
I really like it.

743
00:39:41,653 --> 00:39:43,423
It's cute. Look at this.

744
00:39:43,823 --> 00:39:44,823
Right?

745
00:39:45,823 --> 00:39:47,203
So cute.

746
00:39:48,113 --> 00:39:50,883
You always say I look like a sloth.

747
00:39:51,653 --> 00:39:52,653
Look at this.

748
00:39:52,893 --> 00:39:53,963
It's so cute.

749
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,013
I'll put it here.

750
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:04,083
Be with you.

751
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:12,253
I've never bought you a nice gift.

752
00:40:12,923 --> 00:40:13,923
I'm sorry.

753
00:40:21,103 --> 00:40:22,173
It's okay.

754
00:40:23,093 --> 00:40:26,323
You taking care of me is enough.

755
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:33,313
Nowadays, it's like you take care of me.

756
00:40:45,683 --> 00:40:47,493
Have you grown up this much?

757
00:40:47,753 --> 00:40:48,753
Huh?

758
00:40:50,643 --> 00:40:54,033
I don't know how to take care of you.

759
00:40:56,013 --> 00:40:57,323
What do you mean?

760
00:40:58,733 --> 00:40:59,933
Will you leave me

761
00:41:00,713 --> 00:41:02,223
and not let me stay here?

762
00:41:03,433 --> 00:41:04,883
That's not...

763
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:07,863
I mean

764
00:41:08,243 --> 00:41:09,763
you've grown up.

765
00:41:10,463 --> 00:41:12,263
You can take care of yourself.

766
00:41:12,963 --> 00:41:15,013
You can live without me.

767
00:41:15,703 --> 00:41:16,703
Huh?

768
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,190
Who said that?

769
00:41:22,643 --> 00:41:24,583
If I'm bad at something,

770
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,173
you can tell me.

771
00:41:27,823 --> 00:41:28,823
I'll fix it.

772
00:41:29,373 --> 00:41:30,373
Huh?

773
00:41:33,983 --> 00:41:36,773
It's very good now.

774
00:41:38,693 --> 00:41:40,473
Thank you, Park.

775
00:41:41,303 --> 00:41:43,193
For letting me live here.

776
00:41:45,917 --> 00:41:48,017
If I didn't have you and Auntie,

777
00:41:49,733 --> 00:41:52,043
I wouldn't know how to live.

778
00:41:54,603 --> 00:41:56,233
It's not my home.

779
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:00,435
This is our home.

780
00:42:16,733 --> 00:42:18,603
Thank you so much.

781
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:21,737
I want you.

782
00:42:22,783 --> 00:42:26,733
Without you, I can't live.

783
00:42:31,613 --> 00:42:32,613
Can I...

784
00:42:34,459 --> 00:42:36,053
hug you?

785
00:42:39,883 --> 00:42:42,603
I've been waiting for your hug for a long time.
