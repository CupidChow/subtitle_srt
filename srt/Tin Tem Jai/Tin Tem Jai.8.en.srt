00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,300
(Tin Tem Jai)
(Episode 8)

2
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:36,400
Oh.

3
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,560
I overheard Aunt Toy talking to my mother
that she was going to live with her daughter.

4
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,140
She takes care of
her grandchildren.

5
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,210
She would probably
sell this house.

6
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,370
What are you looking at?
You want to buy it?

7
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,960
How do I have money?

8
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,800
I think you want to
come back to your house.

9
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,470
I don't want to.

10
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,650
I'm happy to be with Park.

11
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,090
Why would I move there, right?

12
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,810
If you move anywhere,

13
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,210
I will surely cry.

14
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,120
What's wrong with you?

15
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:09,030
What?

16
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,820
Or am I missing something?

17
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,330
You were at the
temple the day before.

18
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,050
They have already
agreed to live together.

19
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,690
Aren't they living together normally?

20
00:02:21,365 --> 00:02:27,350
I mean living
together as a couple.

21
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,470
Park!

22
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,010
Why did you choose a
puppy to be your lover?

23
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,320
Kana!

24
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,010
He's not just a puppy,

25
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:36,990
but a teacup dog!

26
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,080
Tin.

27
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,200
Kana! Get off of me!

28
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,230
Ahem!

29
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,980
You guys have your sweetheart.

30
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,230
I am lonely.

31
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,340
Don't leave me.

32
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,740
Walk slowly.

33
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,100
Let's go.

34
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,050
Uncle Tor.

35
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,960
I want crispy pork basil.

36
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:02,610
Okay.

37
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,210
I want it too.

38
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,090
Okay. Two dishes.

39
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,210
Plus me too.

40
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,410
Three dishes. Okay.

41
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,390
Hold on.

42
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,850
Why did you order crispy pork
and order crispy pork again?

43
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,930
It's not the same, Pao. Actually,
you can eat at my restaurant, right?

44
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,480
- There's no basil there.
- It's not the same, Pao.

45
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,650
Hey.

46
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,310
You're Kana.

47
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,790
I haven't seen you for
a long time. I miss you.

48
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,790
How are you?

49
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,460
You guys have been
in jail for a long time.

50
00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:30,885
Hey, you know my deal.

51
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,480
Would you like us to
talk outside?

52
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,380
Let's talk. I miss you. I
haven't seen you for a long time.

53
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,790
Let's go.

54
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,000
Let's go.

55
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,710
Hey, I see that you're stressed.

56
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,590
Would you like some cigarettes?

57
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,750
It's okay.

58
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,220
Give it to him.

59
00:03:50,245 --> 00:03:51,095
Try it.

60
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,030
I've quit smoking.

61
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,360
What are you afraid of?

62
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,480
It's okay. Just one cigarette.

63
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,340
Just one cigarette, what will happen?

64
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,320
Alright.

65
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,020
Take it.

66
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,230
That's it.

67
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:09,609
What did you talk with them about?

68
00:04:10,922 --> 00:04:11,642
Nothing.

69
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,870
Just small things.

70
00:04:15,981 --> 00:04:16,840
What's wrong with you?

71
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,050
Nothing.

72
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,350
So why did you smoke just now?

73
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,350
Just half a cigarette.

74
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,110
You broke our promise.

75
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,620
Why are you mad at me?

76
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,540
Is it a little thing?

77
00:04:27,946 --> 00:04:29,446
Breaking a promise is wrong.

78
00:04:29,723 --> 00:04:30,190
Ka...

79
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,440
You talk too much!

80
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,510
Kana.

81
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,050
It's salty.

82
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,740
It's the saliva of a mad dog.

83
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,560
You are the one who teased me first.

84
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,670
Go sit at another table.
I stink of cigarettes.

85
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,390
Hey!

86
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,180
I'm not going!

87
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:41,880
Hey!

88
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,770
Kana!

89
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,143
Take your seat.

90
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:45,299
Go!

91
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,320
Park...

92
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,990
Kana teased me.

93
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,180
Right here.

94
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,980
Can you blow it for me?

95
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,540
Abracadabra!

96
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,070
You're better now.

97
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,390
Am I the only one who isn't
used to seeing Park do this?

98
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,330
Pink, I want to borrow your paint.

99
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:37,930
I'm exhausted.

100
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,130
Do you want to get
bubble tea with me?

101
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:40,830
Shall we go?

102
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:41,950
Tin.

103
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:42,375
Huh?

104
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,760
Would you like to drink bubble tea with me?

105
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,010
Sure.

106
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,580
Let's go.

107
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,020
Give me a moment.

108
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,710
I'm very hungry.
Hot weather makes me sleepy.

109
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:54,819
I want to drink coffee.

110
00:05:54,844 --> 00:05:55,574
Let's go.

111
00:05:56,202 --> 00:05:58,242
What should I order today?

112
00:05:58,267 --> 00:06:00,267
I would like a cup of sweet jasmine tea.

113
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,310
You want to amputate your leg?

114
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,000
I would like a cup of less sweet bubble tea,

115
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,250
and a cup of less sweet.

116
00:06:06,838 --> 00:06:08,048
You ordered two drinks?

117
00:06:08,853 --> 00:06:09,643
Who did you order it for?

118
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,250
Hey. Who did you order it for?

119
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,670
Yes. Who did you order it for?

120
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,180
I ordered it for Park.

121
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,180
What about us?

122
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,200
Just order it.

123
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,320
I was disappointed with him.

124
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,220
There, there.

125
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,750
You must treat us first.

126
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,300
Treat us to one drink.

127
00:06:26,542 --> 00:06:27,482
I'd like two drinks.

128
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,200
Two drinks.

129
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,430
Well, I'm going to
ask Park for money.

130
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,300
Park!

131
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,770
I'm shocked!

132
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,550
I'm sorry.

133
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,710
Yeah.

134
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,400
Why did you come back late today?

135
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,870
I was doing my homework.

136
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,090
I already told you.

137
00:07:16,285 --> 00:07:18,810
Can you come home early after this?

138
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,030
Why?

139
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,580
I love when I come home and
someone opens the door waiting for me.

140
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,220
The gate is very heavy, you know?

141
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:34,266
I don't have the strength to open it today.

142
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,920
Gosh... Earlier, I thought you missed me.

143
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,920
I miss you too.

144
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,060
I waited a long time for you, you know?

145
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,430
I’m screwed!

146
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:51,980
Huh?

147
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,160
I forgot the watercolor bag.

148
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,000
I don't know where it is.

149
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,000
Calm down.

150
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,210
Just remind yourself of
where you went today.

151
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,390
Plearn Ta.

152
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,310
Just answer it.

153
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,430
Okay.

154
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,360
I will answer it.

155
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,430
Yes.

156
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,020
Heyy.

157
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,280
Where did you find it?

158
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,290
Thank you so much.

159
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,460
Plearn Ta found it at the bubble tea shop.

160
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,830
What's next?

161
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,270
Does it make you that happy?

162
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,260
Huh?

163
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,950
It's my watercolor bag.

164
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,520
How could it not make me happy?

165
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,270
What happened to your face?

166
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:54,990
Why are you frowning?

167
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,480
Nothing.

168
00:09:10,362 --> 00:09:12,782
This is your watercolor bag.

169
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,510
Thank you, Plearn.

170
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,670
Why were you standing there just now?

171
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,810
Nothing.

172
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,480
You scared Plearn.

173
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,540
Why is he afraid of me?

174
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:44,197
I didn't even do anything to him.

175
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,840
I'm jealous of you.

176
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:55,950
Huh?

177
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:56,910
What did you just say?

178
00:10:00,926 --> 00:10:07,220
You always say you don't like it
when I say I'm not jealous of you.

179
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,710
I'm very jealous of you just now.

180
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,240
You're doing too much.

181
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:25,210
I'm sulking.

182
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,180
Hey.

183
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,640
Have you seen Plearn Ta lately?

184
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,540
No.

185
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,220
Now he's disappeared.

186
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,630
We haven't seen him since Tin had
his allergic reaction to almond milk.

187
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,700
Tin.

188
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,160
What is my email password?

189
00:11:00,332 --> 00:11:01,333
Gosh...

190
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,660
You can't remember it again?

191
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,510
How do I know your email password?

192
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:13,580
Huh?

193
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,920
I never told you?

194
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,110
I can't remember it.

195
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,090
It suddenly disappeared from my memory.

196
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,080
Park!

197
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:24,480
Huh?

198
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,660
Do you have amnesia?

199
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,480
Watch yourself.

200
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,470
You tend to be absent-minded.

201
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,450
So I asked the experts.

202
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,340
Who?

203
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,340
Google.

204
00:11:40,693 --> 00:11:42,843
Your symptoms are similar to it.

205
00:11:43,593 --> 00:11:48,343
You are inactive, passive and
lack interest in your surroundings.

206
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:52,799
I think you must have dementia.

207
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,190
Hey.

208
00:11:54,774 --> 00:11:57,384
I'm just in power saving mode.

209
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,980
But I'm worried about you.

210
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,170
You tend to be absent-minded.

211
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,830
I'm not absent-minded.

212
00:12:11,624 --> 00:12:13,504
I just think about random things.

213
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,460
What do you think in your head?

214
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,677
It's you.

215
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,960
You are always knocking around in my head.

216
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,370
I can't express it.

217
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,030
So I have to manage myself like this.

218
00:12:33,975 --> 00:12:36,785
Anyway, do you remember my password?

219
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,390
Let me see.

220
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,000
I'll try it.

221
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,920
It's wrong.

222
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,400
I'll try again.

223
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,060
Okay.

224
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,240
Hey.

225
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,220
It's wrong again.

226
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,260
Get up.

227
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,080
I'll check it.

228
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,040
Get up right now.

229
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,480
I'll check it.

230
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,280
It's wrong again.

231
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:26,330
I think you need to reset your password.

232
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,220
Wait a moment.

233
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,580
What?

234
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,340
Hey!

235
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,400
What password did you enter?

236
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,720
It's your birthday.

237
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,010
My birthday?

238
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,030
Yeah.

239
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,010
Why is it my birthday?

240
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:03,990
Park...

241
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,160
Why is it my birthday?

242
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,940
It's easy to remember.

243
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,080
Is my birthday easy to remember?

244
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:14,540
Yeah.

245
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,160
Because it's important.

246
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:27,456
An important person?

247
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,820
What's wrong with you?

248
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,880
Am I very important to you?

249
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,160
You're really...

250
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:43,980
Just go. I'll keep working.

251
00:15:06,817 --> 00:15:07,680
Park.

252
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,520
Bie sent a message in the group chat.

253
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,220
My phone is upstairs.

254
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,780
Can I use your phone to answer her?

255
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,250
Sure.

256
00:15:18,493 --> 00:15:19,163
Park.

257
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:19,720
Huh?

258
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,300
Bie invites us to dinner.

259
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,510
Yeah.

260
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,270
Okay.

261
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,700
[I want to borrow money from you, sister]
[How much?]

262
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,500
[Ten thousand baht]
[Why is it so much this time?]

263
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,060
[I have to pay Tin's tuition fee next month]
[Okay]

264
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,860
[Aunt Boot hasn't transferred money for about a year]
[Are you going to take care of him like this?]

265
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,860
[Yes] [Can you do it?] [I can
borrow your money if I can't take it]

266
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,260
[Just tell me. I'll help you]
[Okay]

267
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,760
[But you didn't tell Tin anything?
He would get angry if he found out later]

268
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,720
You haven't transferred money to me
for about a year.

269
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,730
Why didn't you tell me?

270
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,880
How can you do this?

271
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,550
You're causing Park trouble.

272
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,990
You can't burden Park like this.

273
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:00,000
The reason Park took care of me
was because he felt guilty about my dad.

274
00:17:00,843 --> 00:17:02,093
But it's too much.

275
00:17:02,574 --> 00:17:04,194
It's not Park's duty.

276
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,680
It's because I think you manage my money.

277
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,070
I didn't think it's causing
Park trouble like this.

278
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,750
I believed you would come back to me.

279
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:45,200
But I really forgot that you threw me
to someone else in the first place.

280
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,450
Uh.

281
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,150
What will they eat?

282
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,580
Hot pot.

283
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,040
I heard Bie wanted to eat it.

284
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,630
But you don't really like hot pot, do you?

285
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,920
I don't dislike it.

286
00:18:35,961 --> 00:18:37,721
I just eat it to get my money's worth.

287
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,510
You don't have to eat
just to get your money's worth.

288
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,150
Just relish it.

289
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,000
But I don't want it to
not be worth the money.

290
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,540
Just relish it.

291
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:53,870
I'll pay for it.

292
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,750
Hello, Teacher Pao.

293
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,750
Hello.

294
00:19:22,646 --> 00:19:24,626
Hey, why are you in such a hurry?

295
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,100
My house is close to here.

296
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,730
Yes. It only takes 3 steps to my home.

297
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,150
Do you want us to go home because
you want to play with our toys?

298
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,250
You are an adult. Just
play something with adults.

299
00:19:35,856 --> 00:19:37,546
Adults can't play it?

300
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:38,260
Huh?

301
00:19:39,752 --> 00:19:40,792
Just go back to your homes.

302
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:41,170
Yeah.

303
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:41,520
Let's go.

304
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,060
Yeah.

305
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,040
Yeah.

306
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,500
My sky is orange today, Tin.

307
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,170
Pao.

308
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:58,600
What's wrong with you?

309
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:00,710
Nothing.

310
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,380
Why are you absent-minded?

311
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:06,950
I'm just sleepy.

312
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,400
I had to take my father to the
hospital early in the morning.

313
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,630
I had to queue all day.

314
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,960
After taking my father to the hospital,
I had to finish my work at school.

315
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,920
You're sleepy,
so why don't you go home and sleep?

316
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,950
I'm back.

317
00:20:29,308 --> 00:20:30,038
But I don't want to go into the house.

318
00:20:30,861 --> 00:20:32,461
Why don't you want to go into the house?

319
00:20:33,568 --> 00:20:35,858
I could only hear my mother
arguing with Pai when I was there.

320
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,480
I don't want to listen to it.

321
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,390
So I went out.

322
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,930
Aunt Tim is angry with Pai again?

323
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,010
They argue every day, just calling each other.

324
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,940
Pao, are you tired?

325
00:20:52,821 --> 00:20:53,821
Are you tired?

326
00:20:54,775 --> 00:20:58,855
No one has ever asked me that.

327
00:21:03,704 --> 00:21:05,434
You're very tired, aren't you, Pao?

328
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:06,870
Yes.

329
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,600
You can vent to me
if you have something to vent about.

330
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:13,111
I wont tell it to anyone.

331
00:21:13,854 --> 00:21:14,634
I promise.

332
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,230
Do you like listening
to boring stories?

333
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:19,430
Not really.

334
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:23,529
But if it eases the weight in your heart,
I'll listen.

335
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,240
You're a really good boy.

336
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,370
It's because Park took care of me
until I grew up.

337
00:21:36,745 --> 00:21:39,975
I am a very good child
in my family's eyes.

338
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:45,620
But at work, I'm just an ordinary person.

339
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,660
Sometimes I'm stupid.

340
00:21:48,685 --> 00:21:49,665
Sometimes I make mistakes.

341
00:21:50,693 --> 00:21:51,703
My job is boring.

342
00:21:52,362 --> 00:21:53,922
Especially society.

343
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,120
I was oppressed by the senior system.

344
00:21:57,145 --> 00:21:58,665
I had to bow to them like a dog.

345
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,980
I had to open my
arms to every task.

346
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,570
I have to accept every task they
throw to me because I was younger.

347
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,100
I want to quit every day.

348
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,740
When someone says they want their children
or grandchildren to work like me.

349
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,720
Why don't they take me as a role model?

350
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,130
I f*cking want to throw up when I hear it.

351
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,490
I'm really disgusted.

352
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:22,850
I pity myself.

353
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:30,490
I don't understand it at all.
Sorry.

354
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,690
I vented a lot.

355
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,850
It's okay.

356
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,780
What job would you like to do
if you weren't a teacher?

357
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,240
I don't want to do anything.

358
00:22:46,454 --> 00:22:48,124
I just want to sleep at home.

359
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,070
Play games all day.

360
00:22:51,365 --> 00:22:52,675
It's really true!

361
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,600
I am the master of the
legendary steamed bun king game.

362
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:55,840
Really?

363
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,060
Of course.

364
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,360
Pao.

365
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:03,860
Huh?

366
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,450
It looks like it's going to rain.

367
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:07,970
I think so.

368
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,150
Shall we go back?

369
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,220
Well, let's go back.

370
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:11,940
Hurry up!

371
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:00,720
Tin.

372
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,190
How are you?

373
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:06,438
I have a headache.

374
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,810
Please get up and
take your medicine first.

375
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:37,740
Come on.

376
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,750
Why are you suddenly sick?

377
00:24:46,654 --> 00:24:47,524
Watch your head.

378
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,890
I have to go now.

379
00:25:29,622 --> 00:25:30,270
Bie.

380
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,270
Please take care of him.

381
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,310
You don't need to
worry. I can help you.

382
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,350
Bie.

383
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:06,650
I'm sorry to trouble you.

384
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,320
It's okay, Tin.

385
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:11,880
It's a small matter.

386
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,260
I can do it.

387
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,650
I'm right here.

388
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,050
If you need help, you can always call me.

389
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:42,570
Park.

390
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:44,300
Okay.

391
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,150
Okay.

392
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,190
Umm.

393
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,330
Sure.

394
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,130
Umm.

395
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,350
Okay.

396
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,420
I'll wipe for him.

397
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:00,020
Park.

398
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,580
Tin's fever has not decreased.

399
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,090
I just wiped for him an hour ago.

400
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,230
I hurried back without changing my shirt.

401
00:27:10,321 --> 00:27:11,551
I'm going to take a shower first.

402
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,420
Thank you, Bie.

403
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,350
It's okay.

404
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,350
Please take care of Tin.

405
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:56,610
Park.

406
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,780
Park.

407
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:01,660
Huh?

408
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:03,390
How are you?

409
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,190
Slow down.

410
00:28:13,886 --> 00:28:16,386
You didn't go to work today?

411
00:28:16,819 --> 00:28:18,029
I'm on leave today.

412
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,070
Is it because of me?

413
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:25,607
Do you have to take a day off
because of me again?

414
00:28:26,537 --> 00:28:28,040
I'm sorry.

415
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,100
I am really your burden.

416
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:36,430
I made you tired,
taking care of me like this.

417
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,240
You talk too much.

418
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:45,510
It's because of me...

419
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,910
Just stay still.

420
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,450
Your temperature is quite high.

421
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:56,240
Come on.

422
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,390
Eat something first.

423
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,450
So that you can take medicine.

424
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,430
I want to throw up.

425
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,190
Hey, Tin!

426
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,670
How are you?

427
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,010
I'm dizzy because of you.

428
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,670
Are you all here?

429
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:29,950
Park.

430
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,720
Huh?

431
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,140
I'm sorry.

432
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,260
Why do you have to apologize to Park?

433
00:29:37,017 --> 00:29:38,597
Park is getting what he deserves.

434
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:43,580
When Park got drunk like a dog,
only you wiped Park's vomit.

435
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,470
Aren't you used to growing up
with Park's vomit?

436
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:53,546
Who do you trouble when you're drunk?

437
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:54,880
Did you know?

438
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,380
Yeah.

439
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,380
- Get out, Kana.
- Huh?

440
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,090
Get up!

441
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,140
Hey, I'm comfortable right now.

442
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,840
Get up! So that Tin can sleep.

443
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,880
Well, here.

444
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,280
We can share space here.

445
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:07,160
Come on, dude.

446
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,160
Just lean there.

447
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:10,800
Alright.

448
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:11,860
I can get up.

449
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,200
What?

450
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,100
Just sleep properly.

451
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:40,820
Do you bite your nails?

452
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:42,569
No...

453
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,006
What is up with you?

454
00:30:44,811 --> 00:30:45,591
What happened?

455
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,970
I can't know if you don't tell me.

456
00:30:50,823 --> 00:30:51,673
Park.

457
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,380
Do you remember Pu At?

458
00:30:55,254 --> 00:30:55,934
What crab stick?

459
00:30:56,602 --> 00:30:57,502
You mean fried crab sticks?

460
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,510
Not that.

461
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:03,667
I mean Pu At,
the dog that we used to raise.

462
00:31:04,249 --> 00:31:04,819
Yeah.

463
00:31:05,972 --> 00:31:07,432
We couldn't raise it,

464
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,150
so we had to let it go.

465
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,110
Park.

466
00:31:12,468 --> 00:31:14,028
If I give you trouble,

467
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,800
you must let me go like Pu At.

468
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,060
What are you saying?

469
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,680
I know all about my mom.

470
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,830
I'm sorry.

471
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,260
I am not angry with you.

472
00:31:34,384 --> 00:31:36,354
But I just feel very sorry for you.

473
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,240
I got you in trouble.

474
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,670
You always have to take care of me.

475
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:47,790
Until now, you have had to find a day off
to take care of me.

476
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,810
I caused you trouble.

477
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,390
I caused even Patsorn problems.

478
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,060
She had to transfer her money to take care of me.

479
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,600
I didn't want to bother your family like this.

480
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,820
Also, I'm stubborn with you.

481
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,400
I don't humble myself, right?

482
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:16,620
When my mom asks you to take care of me,

483
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,770
you can't deny it right?

484
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,740
Because it's about my dad.

485
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,880
But actually,

486
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,900
you don't have to bear it.

487
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:33,430
If I knew the truth,

488
00:32:34,712 --> 00:32:36,772
I wouldn't be here to burden you.

489
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,980
I don't know what you are talking about.

490
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,150
But I don't want to listen to it.

491
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:45,520
Park.

492
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,780
Stop talking about it.

493
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,430
If one day Park let you go,

494
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,841
where will you go?

495
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,910
I used to have the same thoughts as you.

496
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,660
I don't want to be in the house
to be a burden on my father.

497
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:26,560
But I feel empty when I'm really going.

498
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,750
I have no other place to go.

499
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:35,750
But if asked if I really wanted to go,

500
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,260
I didn't want to go anywhere.

501
00:33:42,358 --> 00:33:43,528
Even now,

502
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,270
I think I don't want to go anywhere.

503
00:33:50,312 --> 00:33:53,412
Now I know who really loves me.

504
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,710
Although we are not related by blood,

505
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,680
we love each other like family.

506
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,640
You may think that you are not part of Park.

507
00:34:09,686 --> 00:34:12,996
But you are Park's whole world.

508
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,360
Please look at it from Park's point of view.

509
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,430
If he doesn't have you, how will he live?

510
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,370
He will never let you go anywhere.

511
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:40,610
But Park has problems because of me.

512
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:50,799
He was willing to go to great lengths
to save his whole world.

513
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:57,550
All you can do now is be
by his side like he wants.

514
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:01,680
Just repay him when the time is right.

515
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:07,820
Nobody called love a burden.

516
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,500
Don't worry, Tin.

517
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:30,790
Park!

518
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,940
You're back?

519
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:35,860
Yes.

520
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,120
I miss you so much.

521
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,120
I miss you too.

522
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:47,600
Ouch!

523
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,520
Let me go.

524
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,020
I haven't even taken a shower yet.

525
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:56,300
I might be dirtier than the germs on you.

526
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:59,180
Because I haven't showered either.

527
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,530
Hey.

528
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,800
Ewww!!

529
00:36:03,101 --> 00:36:05,611
You really are rotten, aren't you?

530
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,070
I'm only at home.

531
00:36:09,997 --> 00:36:12,017
But I'm saving you water bills.

532
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,200
Stop it.

533
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:16,760
Stop it.

534
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,530
Go get the food that's
on the motorcycle.

535
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:28,780
Let's go.

536
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,190
Ouch!

537
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,160
What happened to your arm?

538
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,820
Nothing.

539
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,050
Ouch!

540
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,050
You said nothing, didn't you?

541
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,710
Just a little bit.

542
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,260
Just sit first.

543
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,380
I'll check it.

544
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:50,940
Oh.

545
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,680
Please help me take the bag off.

546
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,520
Be careful.

547
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,360
What happened to you?

548
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,950
There was a drunken
rampage at the hospital.

549
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,630
So I help him.

550
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,440
And I got pushed down.

551
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:14,550
My wrist sprained.

552
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:15,990
Wow.

553
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,420
He's terrible.

554
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:21,430
Where do you hurt?

555
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:22,540
Huh?

556
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,660
It's okay.

557
00:37:24,148 --> 00:37:26,000
It can heal if the wrist is not used
for about two days.

558
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,200
I also took a long weekend break.

559
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,970
Hmm? Really?

560
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:31,570
Yeah.

561
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:35,510
Then you can rest well, right?

562
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,810
What?

563
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,740
You don't want to go anywhere, do you?

564
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,330
Like going on a trip.
I rarely get long holidays.

565
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,140
I don't want to go anywhere.

566
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:46,721
I want to be with you.

567
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,520
You really don't want to travel?

568
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,470
You really don't want to go, do you?

569
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,050
I don't want to go anywhere anymore.

570
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,960
Even if you want to go, I won't let you go.

571
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:08,900
Because if you leave me,
what is left of my life?

572
00:38:16,172 --> 00:38:17,662
Do you want me to apply medicine for you?

573
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:18,640
It's okay.

574
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,400
Then I'll blow it for you.

575
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,260
Abracadabra!

576
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:31,500
That's enough.

577
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,150
It stinks.

578
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:34,290
I've brushed my teeth.

579
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:39,860
Babe.

580
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,280
Babe.

581
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,200
Please unpack the snacks for me.

582
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,490
Which ones?

583
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:49,840
This one?

584
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,370
Yeah.

585
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,960
Is it tasty?

586
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:07,980
Yes.

587
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,190
But...

588
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,920
I want to drink orange juice

589
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,300
like you did that day.

590
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,170
Can you do it for me?

591
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,170
Babe.

592
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,270
I want to drink orange juice, not orange.

593
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,440
I know.

594
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,610
Just a moment.

595
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,280
It stuck in my throat.

596
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,340
Calm down.

597
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:35,620
Here, just eat it first.

598
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,080
I'll make you orange juice after this.

599
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:39,820
Yeah.

600
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,650
Yes, sir.

601
00:39:46,204 --> 00:39:47,354
Please be quick.

602
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:48,660
Yeah.

603
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,690
Tin, is it done?

604
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,970
I'm here, Park.

605
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:58,940
Here.

606
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:00,750
Here.

607
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:02,400
Please feed it to me, babe.

608
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:03,780
My hand hurts.

609
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:06,980
Come on.

610
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,780
I will feed you.

611
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,150
Drink it slowly.

612
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,620
It's as delicious as ever.

613
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:21,930
Babe.

614
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,810
Mama!

615
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:37,850
Hello.

616
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:41,310
Umm.

617
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,830
I know.

618
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,520
Just go to bed.

619
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:48,720
Don't worry about it.

620
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:49,900
Umm.

621
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:57,930
Park.

622
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:58,700
Huh?

623
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:05,350
I want to know the reason why Uncle Tong
and Aunt Tim didn't let Pai come back home.

624
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,830
They probably had their reasons.

625
00:41:08,931 --> 00:41:10,211
Adults are difficult to understand.

626
00:41:11,171 --> 00:41:12,791
But you are an adult too.

627
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,040
You don't understand it?

628
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:19,112
I'm not as old as them.

629
00:41:19,675 --> 00:41:20,485
That's right.

630
00:41:21,657 --> 00:41:24,647
I forgot you were in your 20s.

631
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:28,150
But I see you as being
just like everyone's parents.

632
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:31,160
I mean you're old like a dad.

633
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,450
You little bastard.

634
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,900
Why do you like old dads like me?

635
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,000
I just like you already.

636
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,790
You want an old boyfriend?

637
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:52,230
Eat it.

638
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,960
I will keep watching TV.
