00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,300
(Tin Tem Jai)
(Episode 9)

2
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,440
Ouch!

3
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,060
Park!

4
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,040
Hey, it hurts.

5
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,270
Park, help me.

6
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,950
What happened, Kana?

7
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,720
What happened to Pao?

8
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,080
Please help Pao, Park.

9
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,860
What?

10
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,790
Let's go.

11
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,870
Let me go first. I'm hurt.

12
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,680
Pao!

13
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,500
Pao, wake up!

14
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,160
Pao. Park, Pao.

15
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,160
Aunt Tim.

16
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,550
Please help him.

17
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,040
What happened to him?

18
00:01:59,390 --> 00:01:59,990
I don't know.

19
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,150
I saw him collapse here.

20
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,720
Pao!

21
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,360
Pao.

22
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,400
Pao!

23
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,700
Pao!

24
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,650
He has no pulse!

25
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,830
Pao!

26
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,610
Pao!

27
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,740
Tin, call an ambulance!

28
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,180
Okay, I'll call right now.

29
00:02:20,205 --> 00:02:21,535
Pao, come back please!

30
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,230
Come back please!

31
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:24,034
Pao.

32
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:24,914
Come back!

33
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,890
Auntie, why are you holding my sister?

34
00:02:35,203 --> 00:02:35,833
Oh.

35
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,050
I was shocked, so I carried her.

36
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,570
Oh, gosh.

37
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,860
Tim, why are you holding my baby?

38
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,680
Sorry.

39
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,440
Sit here, dear.

40
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,280
Doctor.

41
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,420
How is the patient?

42
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,680
The patient has overdosed on drugs,

43
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,980
causing his body to go into shock.

44
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,400
You know about it, right?

45
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,600
I've just heard it before.

46
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,020
What did you hear?

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,360
Do you remember the person
at the restaurant that day?

48
00:03:09,863 --> 00:03:11,703
He said that Pao took drugs with them.

49
00:03:12,173 --> 00:03:13,713
I thought he remembered
the wrong person.

50
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,920
There was no way he would be
our Pao, so I didn't pay it any mind.

51
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,460
But it was our Pao.

52
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,280
I don't know.

53
00:03:24,314 --> 00:03:25,374
I really don't know.

54
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,540
Did he ever know about it?

55
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,660
Are people like Pao addicted to drugs?

56
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,410
I wouldn't be surprised if it was you!

57
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:34,920
Bie.

58
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,330
Never!

59
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,090
Pao is the person who
took that amphetamine!

60
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,180
It's Pao!

61
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,850
It was only Pao!

62
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,510
Did you know? It's only Pao!

63
00:03:54,249 --> 00:03:56,949
I think he just made a mistake back then.

64
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,290
So I accepted my fault on his behalf.

65
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,770
Because no one would
be surprised if it was me.

66
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,140
I think Pao needs a chance to make amends.

67
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,140
He told me he wouldn't do it again.

68
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,990
But this time, he took drugs again.

69
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:20,799
I really don't know about it, Tin.

70
00:04:21,002 --> 00:04:21,792
Please trust me.

71
00:04:21,991 --> 00:04:22,801
I didn't know.

72
00:04:24,282 --> 00:04:26,402
Well, I trust you right now.

73
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,070
I'm lazy to take a shower.

74
00:04:47,908 --> 00:04:48,988
I can't get up.

75
00:04:49,216 --> 00:04:50,046
My hand hurts too.

76
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,900
Please hold my hand.

77
00:04:53,049 --> 00:04:55,049
Why? Your hand hurts.

78
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Please hold my hand.

79
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,238
That's right.

80
00:05:01,962 --> 00:05:03,462
My hand doesn't hurt
after holding you hand.

81
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:10,021
Don't go.

82
00:05:10,962 --> 00:05:11,342
Huh?

83
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,830
What did you just say?

84
00:05:16,851 --> 00:05:18,101
I said don't go.

85
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,240
I didn't go anywhere.

86
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,080
I'm just going to close the door.

87
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,180
Park.

88
00:05:37,387 --> 00:05:37,937
Huh?

89
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,750
Why do you always smile at my hand?

90
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:43,239
What are you thinking about?

91
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:45,990
Your hands.

92
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:49,584
You used to have tiny hands
when you were a kid.

93
00:05:49,609 --> 00:05:53,199
Your entire hand can only hold my thumb.

94
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,010
Park.

95
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,250
You speak like a father
watching his child grow.

96
00:05:59,410 --> 00:05:59,940
Do you know?

97
00:06:02,464 --> 00:06:06,674
Will you be my boyfriend or my father?

98
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,080
Please be honest.

99
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:09,480
Ouch.

100
00:06:10,014 --> 00:06:11,126
Hey. What happened to you, Park?

101
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:11,941
Ouch...

102
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:12,452
It's because

103
00:06:13,746 --> 00:06:15,186
my heart skipped a beat

104
00:06:16,013 --> 00:06:17,443
when you said you were my boyfriend.

105
00:06:18,715 --> 00:06:22,535
I don't know if it was because of the low
pressure or because you brushed against me.

106
00:06:28,172 --> 00:06:31,586
Are you going to love me like
a family member or like a lover?

107
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,490
I already asked your mother.

108
00:06:35,643 --> 00:06:36,423
What?

109
00:06:38,173 --> 00:06:39,263
I asked her to take care of you.

110
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,992
It's not because I feel
guilty about your father.

111
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:49,265
I told your mother that I love her son.

112
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,226
I really want to take care of you.

113
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:59,080
But I know I'm not good
enough to treat you better.

114
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:10,580
Park.

115
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:12,956
Please look after my me from now on.

116
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,300
Oh, Park.

117
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,230
Tin.

118
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,750
Please say hello to Park.

119
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,700
Hello, Park.

120
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,300
I really miss you, Park.
Are you well, Park?

121
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,750
Yes.

122
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:45,620
Oh!

123
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,320
Would you like a snack?
I'll share it with you.

124
00:07:48,824 --> 00:07:51,074
Yes, please.
You are kind to me again.

125
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:52,247
Just pick one.

126
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,300
Did you visit Pao?

127
00:07:55,532 --> 00:07:56,092
Yeah.

128
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:59,709
I bought snacks for them.
They are in the room.

129
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:01,027
They might be starving.

130
00:08:01,052 --> 00:08:01,602
Okay.

131
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,620
Let's meet Park another day.

132
00:08:04,003 --> 00:08:06,243
Bye. Good luck, Park.

133
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:07,208
Bye bye.

134
00:08:07,758 --> 00:08:09,058
Okay, see you. Bye.

135
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:09,733
See you.

136
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,260
Do you know how dangerous it is
to become addicted to drugs?

137
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,340
It helped me.

138
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,380
What the hell does it help you with?

139
00:08:21,523 --> 00:08:24,963
If Park didn't help you,
you'd be lying in a coffin now.

140
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,150
Did you know that Park...

141
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:31,840
Park.

142
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,750
I just don't want to
eat one line at a time.

143
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,480
If you want to eat several lines at a time,

144
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,660
just eat it.

145
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,590
I got scolded~

146
00:08:44,345 --> 00:08:45,465
Come here.

147
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,380
You promised me

148
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,210
you wouldn't do it again.

149
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,340
I'm sorry...

150
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,340
It's my fault.

151
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,470
Alright.

152
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,780
I want to punch you hard
when you get out of the hospital.

153
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,790
Let's eat snacks.

154
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:13,889
The snacks are very appetizing.

155
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,130
Do you want to eat? I'll unpack it for you.

156
00:09:16,318 --> 00:09:17,938
I feel very guilty.

157
00:09:18,518 --> 00:09:20,608
I didn't know Pao would be like this.

158
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:25,690
If I didn't go to Bangkok, he wouldn't
have to bear the pressure alone.

159
00:09:26,952 --> 00:09:28,632
Just come back here.

160
00:09:30,104 --> 00:09:31,134
Mom doesn't want me back.

161
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,130
Why doesn't she want you back?

162
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:40,430
She said that I didn't
care about the my future.

163
00:09:41,408 --> 00:09:42,638
That I was adventerous...

164
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,280
She knows I don't like being here.

165
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,090
She knows I love freedom.

166
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:54,790
Besides, she probably thinks that
I can't live without men and alcohol.

167
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,560
It's because I like to enjoy life.

168
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,720
Besides,

169
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,300
she's probably worried
about what I'm doing.

170
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,030
I haven't studied a lot.

171
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:09,370
If I get bored here and
start a new life in Bangkok again,

172
00:10:09,395 --> 00:10:10,955
she might be worried about me.

173
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And what's your reason?

174
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,190
The real reason you want to come back here.

175
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:23,420
If I tell you, you'll say I'm
not thinking about my future.

176
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,630
Don't judge me.

177
00:10:26,053 --> 00:10:27,263
Just say it first.

178
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,000
Pao cried.

179
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,320
At that time, Pao was drunk.

180
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,090
He called me.

181
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:41,244
He said he wanted me back to live with him.

182
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,960
What's next?

183
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,110
What is your answer?

184
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,000
I do not understand.

185
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,940
Why should I go back to live with him,

186
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,390
even though I've been
jealous of him all along?

187
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,290
He is better at studying than me.

188
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,070
He's smarter than me.

189
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,220
Dad said I was dumber than my brother.

190
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,630
No matter how well I do,

191
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,037
I can't be his son.

192
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,100
So I thought

193
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,960
they could live

194
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,860
without me there.

195
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,590
So I decided to leave the house.

196
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:26,620
Umm.

197
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,140
What's next?

198
00:11:30,726 --> 00:11:32,256
I said I'm not going back.

199
00:11:33,148 --> 00:11:34,958
I don't want to throw my life away.

200
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,670
So he asked me,

201
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:41,244
What about his life?

202
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,220
Can he decide anything?

203
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,660
I'm really hurt.

204
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,150
I heard him cry

205
00:11:52,224 --> 00:11:53,364
and thought...

206
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,140
I had to come back and do something.

207
00:11:59,328 --> 00:12:01,458
I may seem like I don't care,

208
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,940
to leave my life behind and come back here.

209
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,280
At least, I just want him to live his life.

210
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,640
It's okay.

211
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:30,911
Are you okay?

212
00:12:33,772 --> 00:12:34,492
Get up.

213
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:36,479
It messed up my hands.

214
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,398
Tin!

215
00:12:40,547 --> 00:12:41,117
Come here.

216
00:12:48,405 --> 00:12:49,715
I'll help you.

217
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,140
Stand there.

218
00:12:54,886 --> 00:12:55,796
Hey, you.

219
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:57,013
Look at you.

220
00:12:57,061 --> 00:12:57,871
I'm still okay.

221
00:12:58,421 --> 00:12:59,121
Park.

222
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:00,106
Hey!

223
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,600
Let's change.

224
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,960
Wow, Park.

225
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,380
His body is heavy.

226
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,650
1... 2!

227
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,520
Let's go.

228
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,790
Walk properly.

229
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,560
His vomit.

230
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,130
Who hurt me?

231
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,820
That's the door.

232
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,180
It's a door, so what next?

233
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,180
Will they fight me?

234
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,030
Park!

235
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,030
Come here, Park.

236
00:13:37,088 --> 00:13:37,872
Let me go!

237
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:41,373
You're so mean, Kana.

238
00:13:41,718 --> 00:13:43,758
Who else is a drunk like Park?

239
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,220
His dad.

240
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,880
Uncle Keng taught him to drink
since he was a teenager.

241
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,160
You drink with me, don't you?

242
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,490
Your dad also taught me.

243
00:13:53,882 --> 00:13:56,282
I don't forget that I'm the
heavyweight because of it.

244
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,360
You guys look good together.

245
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,020
Oh, Kana.

246
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,420
Don't say that.

247
00:14:02,663 --> 00:14:04,373
Tin will be angry with me.

248
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,420
Just sleep.

249
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,090
Where are you going, Tin?

250
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,190
Pai.

251
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:12,650
Huh?

252
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,550
You already know about it?

253
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,540
Who told you?

254
00:14:15,782 --> 00:14:17,332
It was Park who called to brag to me.

255
00:14:17,818 --> 00:14:20,318
I love Tin and Tin loves me.

256
00:14:20,384 --> 00:14:21,954
I love Tin and Tin loves me.

257
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,060
He kept saying it so that
it made me very jealous.

258
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,130
Is it true that you and
Park used to date?

259
00:14:29,898 --> 00:14:30,848
Are you jealous, kiddo?

260
00:14:31,855 --> 00:14:33,465
We were confused.

261
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,330
Because we used to be very close.

262
00:14:36,925 --> 00:14:38,495
But in the end, it's nothing.

263
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,072
And we used to kiss.

264
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,060
But we didn't feel
anything from it.

265
00:14:44,922 --> 00:14:45,412
Huh?

266
00:14:45,437 --> 00:14:48,037
When did you guys kiss?

267
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:50,839
Baby.

268
00:14:50,867 --> 00:14:52,397
Don't be jealous of the past.

269
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:54,036
No, I'm not jealous.

270
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,650
I just want to know when you guys kissed.

271
00:14:58,383 --> 00:15:01,403
At that time, Park was
dating a woman, right?

272
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,580
What was her name?

273
00:15:03,816 --> 00:15:04,756
Plam Thip!

274
00:15:04,781 --> 00:15:05,351
Yes.

275
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,180
After breaking up with her, he told me
that he might not have feelings for women.

276
00:15:10,205 --> 00:15:12,815
Women don't do anything for him.

277
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,860
He might've been confused at that time.

278
00:15:15,037 --> 00:15:16,317
So I kissed him.

279
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,044
Do you know what he told me?

280
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:19,229
What?

281
00:15:20,588 --> 00:15:22,688
He said, kiss my feet!

282
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:23,203
Hey.

283
00:15:23,947 --> 00:15:25,237
Sounds like Park!

284
00:15:25,262 --> 00:15:25,872
Yes.

285
00:15:25,897 --> 00:15:27,547
I adore him, right?

286
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,180
So I kissed him.

287
00:15:29,322 --> 00:15:30,532
But he didn't avoid me.

288
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:36,800
He probably wanted to prove
how he felt about women.

289
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,250
But in the end, I didn't feel anything.

290
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:44,033
So I knew I didn't like
him and he didn't like me.

291
00:15:44,691 --> 00:15:47,881
You mean he doesn't like women like you?

292
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:51,601
He said he saw me as a woman.

293
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,760
Oh...

294
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:55,689
Oh.

295
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,429
He said he really likes you.

296
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,241
How do you know?

297
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:04,668
Park mentions me to you?

298
00:16:05,106 --> 00:16:06,196
Sometimes.

299
00:16:06,555 --> 00:16:07,955
But it's not often.

300
00:16:08,361 --> 00:16:12,681
He said, hey, Tin's
getting prettier every day.

301
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,080
Tin must seduce me.

302
00:16:15,105 --> 00:16:18,685
My heart was beating very hard.

303
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:22,313
I don't want to hide my
relationship with Park from you.

304
00:16:22,973 --> 00:16:27,113
I'm just afraid of what
people around me might think.

305
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:31,139
Because not everyone understands it.

306
00:16:32,631 --> 00:16:35,651
I'm afraid people will think
that Park and I aren't normal.

307
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,510
Forget it, Tin.

308
00:16:37,672 --> 00:16:38,692
Forget it?

309
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:39,619
Yes.

310
00:16:39,827 --> 00:16:41,017
Why should you care about them?

311
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:44,092
People just focus on their lives.

312
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:47,458
People like gossiping anyway.

313
00:16:47,588 --> 00:16:50,708
We can't keep their mouths shut
so they won't gossip about us.

314
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,700
Also, it's hard to get
everyone to accept us.

315
00:16:57,065 --> 00:16:59,795
But we don't need to change our identity.

316
00:17:00,405 --> 00:17:03,845
Just do you and be what
you are happy with yourself.

317
00:17:04,205 --> 00:17:04,915
Okay.

318
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,260
Oh, they have arrived.

319
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,200
You're here.

320
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,020
Come on.

321
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,490
Let's go into the house.

322
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,010
Come on.

323
00:17:14,345 --> 00:17:16,285
Thank you.

324
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,400
Hello, dear.

325
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,230
Hi, Pao.

326
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,060
Two crispy pork rice, please.

327
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:26,770
Oh...

328
00:17:27,064 --> 00:17:28,644
Today the restaurant is closed.

329
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,470
Oh?

330
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,610
What a pity.

331
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,350
Sorry.

332
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,390
Oh, Pao.

333
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,940
Are you well?

334
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,560
Yes.

335
00:17:37,731 --> 00:17:39,171
It's good that you're safe.

336
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,920
People can make mistakes.

337
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,525
Well, just think of it as your lesson.

338
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,910
It's scary.

339
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,000
We know people's outsides,
but we don't know their insides.

340
00:17:49,804 --> 00:17:50,754
I told you.

341
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,080
Children tend to be good
in front of their parents.

342
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,509
They all do bad things
behind their parents' backs.

343
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:57,200
Hey.

344
00:17:57,853 --> 00:17:59,060
You said it in front of us.

345
00:17:59,085 --> 00:18:00,145
You're...

346
00:18:04,335 --> 00:18:06,495
Is your nephew okay?

347
00:18:06,522 --> 00:18:07,592
My nephew?

348
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:09,221
Good.

349
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,590
I saw that he injured
his head the other day.

350
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,070
I don't know how he is now.

351
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,400
What?

352
00:18:14,603 --> 00:18:17,680
The other day your
nephew was hit in the head.

353
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,980
He had multiple stitches.

354
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,300
Really?

355
00:18:20,751 --> 00:18:22,741
He fought someone at the club.

356
00:18:23,665 --> 00:18:25,385
I healed him with my own two hands.

357
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,020
I didn't ask for your thanks.

358
00:18:28,978 --> 00:18:30,008
I'm just doing my duty.

359
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:34,615
But you probably don't know, right?

360
00:18:35,486 --> 00:18:38,060
Because your nephew
begged me not to tell anyone.

361
00:18:39,593 --> 00:18:42,463
But today I just suddenly said a lot.

362
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,740
The restaurant is now closed.
Let's go to another restaurant.

363
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,379
Just go!

364
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,780
You guys are very insidious.

365
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:52,860
They talk a lot.

366
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:53,940
Annoying.

367
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,780
Did her nephew really
got hit in the head?

368
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:58,740
Yes.

369
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,300
Park.

370
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:00,770
Huh?

371
00:19:01,572 --> 00:19:02,422
Thank you.

372
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,300
Yeah.

373
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,490
If that aunt were still here, she would
have been hit in the head like her nephew.

374
00:19:10,553 --> 00:19:11,390
What should I order today?

375
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,380
Crispy pork.

376
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,380
It's so delicious.

377
00:19:13,405 --> 00:19:13,915
Hey!

378
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,300
That's Kana!

379
00:19:15,325 --> 00:19:17,105
Hey, let's talk to our friend.

380
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,830
What are you guys doing here?

381
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,140
This is my house.

382
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:21,930
Really?

383
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:22,980
Don't you know?

384
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,230
I don't even remember your name.

385
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,190
Damn.

386
00:19:26,236 --> 00:19:26,816
Hey.

387
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:29,770
Hey.

388
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,160
Are you Pao?

389
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,170
Hey, I heard you're addicted
to knockout, is that true?

390
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,970
I'm giving up on you.

391
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:42,210
Do you drag your friends down with
you? You're both addicted to drugs.

392
00:19:42,235 --> 00:19:44,875
You were expelled in high school
for being addicted to drugs.

393
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,300
You really have no future.

394
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,740
I'm giving up on you.

395
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,060
I'm not close to you to the point
that you can talk shit to me.

396
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,360
What?

397
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,610
We are your friends.

398
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,040
Right? Baby.

399
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,580
Oh. Right? Barbie.

400
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,250
You haven't changed either.

401
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,240
Are you a man or a woman?

402
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,090
Your appearance looks like a man.

403
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,480
But it's weird that you dress like a woman.

404
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,150
Hey, you're talking a lot.

405
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,810
She's pretty cute.

406
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,480
Be careful with your words.

407
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,650
Hey, just kidding.

408
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,640
You're just joking,

409
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,090
but do you know manners?

410
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,940
Okay.

411
00:20:20,176 --> 00:20:22,170
Looks like you guys
don't want to talk to us.

412
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,400
Are you listening to yourselves?

413
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,760
Should I talk to you guys?

414
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,840
Don't invent words, Kana.

415
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,910
Your nature is no different from ours.

416
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,092
We smoked together in school.

417
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,540
We are good friends.

418
00:20:35,144 --> 00:20:37,744
But growing up, you act like
you're higher than me. Damn.

419
00:20:38,168 --> 00:20:39,528
Just use your mouth to eat.

420
00:20:39,553 --> 00:20:41,713
I don't want to talk to you guys that much.

421
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,310
You think you're cool?

422
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,110
Another person is addicted to drugs.

423
00:20:47,449 --> 00:20:49,159
The other has no future.

424
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,390
Another person has a wrong gender.

425
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,410
Hey!

426
00:20:54,672 --> 00:20:55,232
Kana!

427
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,300
Hey!

428
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,000
Park!

429
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:58,810
Park!

430
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,040
Park! Hurry up!

431
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,910
Why do they have to fight?

432
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,660
I'm on vacation.

433
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,380
Why do I still have to work?

434
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,190
Are you injured?

435
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,080
I'm not hurt anywhere.

436
00:21:18,226 --> 00:21:18,816
Good.

437
00:21:20,623 --> 00:21:22,293
How can you still be
sweet in a situation like this?

438
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,920
Shut up.

439
00:21:25,266 --> 00:21:27,586
Why did you suddenly fight them?

440
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,960
He was talking so much shit!

441
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,720
Did you hear what they said?

442
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,530
They have shitty mouths.

443
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,940
They cursed my friends.

444
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,260
How can I endure it?

445
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,334
Just go back to your home.

446
00:21:51,086 --> 00:21:51,716
Let's go.

447
00:21:53,614 --> 00:21:54,194
Pao.

448
00:21:54,932 --> 00:21:55,552
Huh?

449
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,340
Do you remember what I told you?

450
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:03,160
If you leave the hospital,
I want to punch you once.

451
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,800
What's wrong with you?

452
00:22:08,507 --> 00:22:09,247
Hey!

453
00:22:09,732 --> 00:22:10,452
Kana!

454
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,480
What are you doing?

455
00:22:12,878 --> 00:22:13,548
Hey.

456
00:22:13,602 --> 00:22:14,482
Are you okay?

457
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,680
You punched me
with all your strength.

458
00:22:23,516 --> 00:22:24,396
Remember it.

459
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:25,880
Don't get involved with drugs again.

460
00:22:26,063 --> 00:22:28,453
Otherwise I will punch you more.

461
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:34,120
I don't like people saying
you're a drug addict.

462
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,620
I also don't like it when people curse me.

463
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,740
Ouch.

464
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,460
Calm down.

465
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,070
Park.

466
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,770
He has a nosebleed.

467
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:50,930
Umm.

468
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,830
And you keep finding
work for me to do.

469
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,880
I don't have the courage to hit it.

470
00:23:05,963 --> 00:23:08,453
If you don't dare, I'll smash it myself.

471
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,240
Park!

472
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,980
Wow.

473
00:23:17,699 --> 00:23:19,489
You killed a piggy.

474
00:23:20,256 --> 00:23:23,096
At least he died doing his duty.

475
00:23:24,157 --> 00:23:27,757
Maybe you can even buy me a house
and land with that money.

476
00:23:29,521 --> 00:23:30,421
What?

477
00:23:31,997 --> 00:23:35,577
Didn't you ask me what
I want for my birthday?

478
00:23:37,748 --> 00:23:39,008
Is it expensive?

479
00:23:40,368 --> 00:23:42,328
This is all my money.

480
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:47,710
What I want is that you don't have to
break this piggy bank.

481
00:23:49,066 --> 00:23:51,016
What is your wish?

482
00:23:52,024 --> 00:23:56,854
I want to kiss you on my birthday.

483
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,480
Are you too impatient?

484
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:09,073
Did you just realize that
you had to scold me?

485
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:13,138
I'm not going to scold you.

486
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:17,225
Why is your face grim?

487
00:24:19,123 --> 00:24:20,623
I'm just wondering.

488
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:22,851
What?

489
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,270
Will I get it

490
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,290
on my birthday again?

491
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:45,350
Welcome to my salon!

492
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,113
Wow.

493
00:24:46,138 --> 00:24:47,108
How is it?

494
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,900
It's so beautiful.

495
00:24:49,336 --> 00:24:52,196
How about your Bangkok salon?

496
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:55,730
I let my friend handle it there.

497
00:24:55,821 --> 00:24:58,761
In case I have to go back,
I won't start over.

498
00:25:03,408 --> 00:25:04,088
Well!

499
00:25:04,652 --> 00:25:06,402
Are you ready to start your work, guys?

500
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,640
Yes!

501
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,260
Okay. Let's get started!

502
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:28,405
Are you guys tired?

503
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,070
Hello.

504
00:25:30,115 --> 00:25:31,255
Hello.

505
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,910
Hello. Sit down here.

506
00:25:35,916 --> 00:25:37,916
I brought you some fruit.

507
00:25:37,941 --> 00:25:41,111
If you are tired,
you can just rest and eat fruit.

508
00:25:41,942 --> 00:25:43,392
It's okay. I'm enjoying it.

509
00:25:45,202 --> 00:25:47,032
Your food is here.

510
00:25:47,141 --> 00:25:48,841
Put it here.

511
00:25:48,888 --> 00:25:51,020
You guys don't take a break.
Just eat it first.

512
00:25:51,045 --> 00:25:53,285
It looks tasty.

513
00:25:53,482 --> 00:25:56,392
Have you guys bought all the furniture yet?

514
00:25:56,803 --> 00:25:59,283
I don't have two sofas yet.

515
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:00,818
They will send it to me later.

516
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,700
I'll put it here and there.

517
00:26:03,725 --> 00:26:05,725
Why did you buy the sofa?

518
00:26:06,295 --> 00:26:08,055
For the customers to sit.

519
00:26:09,928 --> 00:26:14,248
My teak table is so
beautiful, you can put it...

520
00:26:14,976 --> 00:26:17,206
It's beautiful and very appropriate.

521
00:26:17,592 --> 00:26:23,072
I think it might not fit the
modern style that much.

522
00:26:23,097 --> 00:26:24,377
It's okay.

523
00:26:24,402 --> 00:26:24,892
Really?

524
00:26:25,145 --> 00:26:27,055
I think it's appropriate.

525
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,900
You can put it right here.

526
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,900
It's beautiful. For your customers to sit.

527
00:26:33,488 --> 00:26:34,418
It's okay.

528
00:26:34,713 --> 00:26:36,183
Thank you.

529
00:26:36,377 --> 00:26:36,917
Yeah.

530
00:26:36,942 --> 00:26:38,002
She's very stubborn.

531
00:26:38,027 --> 00:26:41,907
Well. Just let the kids do their business.

532
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,790
Let's eat noodles.

533
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,150
Okay.

534
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,410
I have to go now.

535
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,350
Thank you.

536
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,320
Thank you. Bye bye.

537
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,320
Thank you. Good bye.

538
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,330
Have you guys washed your hands yet?

539
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,140
No.

540
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,910
Just eat it.

541
00:27:07,134 --> 00:27:08,244
Good evening.

542
00:27:12,941 --> 00:27:18,736
It probably wasn't
for Valentine's Day.

543
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,106
It not because it's a
Buddhist Sabbath Day either.

544
00:27:24,617 --> 00:27:25,844
Did you remember
the wrong day, Name?

545
00:27:26,751 --> 00:27:29,746
I just want to show you
how much love I have for you.

546
00:27:30,439 --> 00:27:33,435
I just want to say I love you officially.

547
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:34,824
Name.

548
00:27:34,849 --> 00:27:36,173
Listen to me.

549
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:37,889
If you really love me,

550
00:27:38,141 --> 00:27:39,545
you must take care of me.

551
00:27:39,955 --> 00:27:41,190
Cherish me.

552
00:27:41,215 --> 00:27:42,646
And protect me.

553
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:45,473
Or like the English word, to "nurture."

554
00:27:47,739 --> 00:27:51,223
More importantly, you must not cheat on me.

555
00:27:51,487 --> 00:27:52,643
Can you do it?

556
00:27:54,477 --> 00:27:55,757
Sure.

557
00:27:58,707 --> 00:28:00,903
I want to tell you

558
00:28:01,885 --> 00:28:03,894
that I love you too.

559
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,261
Park.

560
00:28:20,286 --> 00:28:20,695
Huh?

561
00:28:21,526 --> 00:28:22,549
Do you have shoulder pain?

562
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:24,118
I'm a little tired.

563
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:25,595
Today I used a lot of strength.

564
00:28:27,149 --> 00:28:28,209
I'll give you a massage.

565
00:28:29,205 --> 00:28:30,414
Can you massage?

566
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:33,257
Sure.

567
00:28:33,472 --> 00:28:37,688
I often massaged Aunt
Phaweenee's shoulders in the past.

568
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:48,368
Your hands are quite strong.

569
00:28:50,466 --> 00:28:51,800
I'll go easy on you.

570
00:29:18,315 --> 00:29:18,893
Ouch!

571
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,991
Tin!

572
00:29:20,474 --> 00:29:21,594
What are you doing?

573
00:29:22,949 --> 00:29:24,931
I like your shoulder.

574
00:29:25,658 --> 00:29:26,627
Tin!

575
00:29:27,578 --> 00:29:29,000
It's inedible.

576
00:29:30,742 --> 00:29:31,462
It's inedible.

577
00:29:31,462 --> 00:29:33,810
Tin. It's inedible.

578
00:29:33,835 --> 00:29:34,488
Tin!

579
00:29:34,513 --> 00:29:35,051
Huh?

580
00:29:35,871 --> 00:29:37,106
No!

581
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,849
You...

582
00:29:38,954 --> 00:29:40,234
Tin! Stop!

583
00:29:41,332 --> 00:29:42,114
Stop it.

584
00:29:42,499 --> 00:29:43,954
You play like you were a kid.

585
00:29:44,348 --> 00:29:45,353
You've grown up.

586
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,429
My birthday is about to pass.

587
00:30:02,677 --> 00:30:03,583
So?

588
00:30:04,772 --> 00:30:05,981
What about my gift?

589
00:30:07,018 --> 00:30:08,058
Do I have to ask for it?

590
00:30:23,524 --> 00:30:24,831
Just come and get it yourself.

591
00:31:30,377 --> 00:31:30,920
Umm.

592
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,400
Hmm?

593
00:31:31,911 --> 00:31:32,738
What?

594
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:39,541
What?

595
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:42,083
I'm embarrassed.

596
00:31:44,931 --> 00:31:46,273
It's just a normal thing, isn't it?

597
00:31:47,542 --> 00:31:49,666
It's just a physiological reaction.

598
00:31:51,001 --> 00:31:57,926
The boner is caused by the nervous
system, blood vessels and glands...

599
00:31:57,951 --> 00:31:58,982
Park...

600
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,235
I don't want you to be
Wikipedia for me right now.

601
00:32:04,004 --> 00:32:05,977
I'm so embarrassed.

602
00:32:07,995 --> 00:32:09,151
Why are you embarrassed?

603
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,982
I'm not cute anymore, right?

604
00:32:17,337 --> 00:32:23,497
I'm vulgar, obscene and lustful.

605
00:32:31,604 --> 00:32:34,653
Your nature is lovely.

606
00:32:35,728 --> 00:32:36,955
Why are you embarrassed?

607
00:32:37,817 --> 00:32:41,986
I have to see every part of you anyway.

608
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,510
Either way, you're still pretty.

609
00:32:52,348 --> 00:32:53,645
I get it.

610
00:32:59,721 --> 00:33:00,370
Just sleep.

611
00:33:01,414 --> 00:33:02,890
I have to wake up early tomorrow.

612
00:33:05,836 --> 00:33:06,352
Well.

613
00:33:24,147 --> 00:33:24,689
Park!

614
00:33:27,853 --> 00:33:28,938
Why are you guys here?

615
00:33:32,822 --> 00:33:34,022
We came to pick you up.

616
00:33:34,893 --> 00:33:36,493
Why did you guys come?

617
00:33:36,884 --> 00:33:38,467
It's raining.

618
00:33:38,742 --> 00:33:40,840
Will you stand here until the morning?

619
00:33:40,946 --> 00:33:42,208
Tin is worried about you.

620
00:33:44,227 --> 00:33:45,845
I didn't ask you to pick me up.

621
00:33:46,866 --> 00:33:49,044
I'm just coming to pick you up.
What is the problem?

622
00:33:49,745 --> 00:33:51,327
We will drive you here tomorrow too.

623
00:33:52,795 --> 00:33:53,506
Yes.

624
00:33:53,711 --> 00:33:55,017
They will come here every day.

625
00:33:55,675 --> 00:33:57,462
I will come until you stop complaining.

626
00:33:59,365 --> 00:34:00,689
You guys...

627
00:34:02,035 --> 00:34:03,102
Let's go.

628
00:34:03,127 --> 00:34:04,353
I want to eat crepes.

629
00:34:04,704 --> 00:34:05,167
Yes.

630
00:34:05,192 --> 00:34:06,090
I'll hold you.

631
00:34:06,115 --> 00:34:07,306
Let's buy some crepes.

632
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:51,747
Hello, Park.

633
00:34:51,772 --> 00:34:52,927
Hello.

634
00:34:53,335 --> 00:34:54,491
Have you finished work yet?

635
00:34:55,524 --> 00:34:56,581
Yes.

636
00:34:57,019 --> 00:34:58,806
But you don't have to pick me up today.

637
00:34:58,831 --> 00:35:01,921
I think I'll go back myself so I
can bring the motorcycle back.

638
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,013
If I leave it parked
for days, it won't start.

639
00:35:04,132 --> 00:35:05,568
Okay.

640
00:35:05,748 --> 00:35:07,423
But I'll come back with you.

641
00:35:07,448 --> 00:35:07,954
Huh?

642
00:35:17,925 --> 00:35:19,329
Why don't you go back first?

643
00:35:21,248 --> 00:35:22,724
I just miss you.

644
00:35:24,867 --> 00:35:25,765
Sit here.

645
00:35:32,233 --> 00:35:33,104
Here.

646
00:35:36,485 --> 00:35:37,676
How do you know I want to drink it?

647
00:35:38,151 --> 00:35:39,413
I just mentioned this now.

648
00:35:40,148 --> 00:35:41,491
How could I not know?

649
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,093
I'm always in your heart.

650
00:35:44,991 --> 00:35:46,200
My heart is on this side.

651
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,911
Oh, this is my side.

652
00:35:49,182 --> 00:35:50,417
Aren't you uncomfortable?

653
00:35:51,354 --> 00:35:52,687
Why should I be uncomfortable?

654
00:35:53,008 --> 00:35:56,039
My heart is full of you.

655
00:35:59,415 --> 00:36:00,829
Park, you're...

656
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,109
And...

657
00:36:04,755 --> 00:36:06,764
You intend to come to me, right?

658
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:08,959
Of course.

659
00:36:08,984 --> 00:36:10,024
I came to see you.

660
00:36:10,049 --> 00:36:11,347
Who else do I want to meet?

661
00:36:12,548 --> 00:36:17,384
Plearn... Ta or something.

662
00:36:18,592 --> 00:36:19,774
Plearn Ta?

663
00:36:21,024 --> 00:36:22,384
He admitted here.

664
00:36:23,017 --> 00:36:26,004
It looked like he was
skateboarding and fell.

665
00:36:26,066 --> 00:36:27,160
His face was injured.

666
00:36:28,635 --> 00:36:29,782
Was he hurt a lot?

667
00:36:31,473 --> 00:36:32,753
Would you like to visit him?

668
00:36:34,324 --> 00:36:35,391
Can I?

669
00:36:35,837 --> 00:36:38,059
You don't like him.

670
00:36:39,812 --> 00:36:44,132
As a human being, you have
the right to worry about him.

671
00:36:55,986 --> 00:36:57,799
I'll wait for you outside.

672
00:36:58,076 --> 00:36:58,761
Okay.

673
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:10,804
PaFan!

674
00:37:12,259 --> 00:37:13,308
Where are you doing?

675
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,462
My mom brought Nim for treatment.

676
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,768
Stay with me here.

677
00:37:17,943 --> 00:37:18,760
I'll take you there.

678
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:19,349
Okay.

679
00:37:25,696 --> 00:37:26,265
Oh.

680
00:37:26,824 --> 00:37:27,562
Tin.

681
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:31,475
Why are you here?

682
00:37:31,789 --> 00:37:33,958
Park told me.

683
00:37:34,397 --> 00:37:36,575
Are you okay?

684
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:37,870
I've recovered.

685
00:37:38,306 --> 00:37:40,004
I can leave the hospital tomorrow.

686
00:37:48,306 --> 00:37:49,942
Let's go into the room with me.

687
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,786
You're not hurting
much, are you?

688
00:37:53,086 --> 00:37:53,631
Yes.

689
00:37:54,193 --> 00:37:54,913
Hey!

690
00:37:55,604 --> 00:37:56,973
Why did you come in?

691
00:37:57,037 --> 00:37:58,325
I'm here to secretly see...

692
00:37:59,326 --> 00:38:00,864
if he's still flirting with you.

693
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,133
Have you guys liked each other before?

694
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:04,667
It's him.

695
00:38:05,077 --> 00:38:06,517
I'm just someone who used to like him.

696
00:38:07,524 --> 00:38:10,382
Someone who used to like. Does that
mean you don't have them anymore?

697
00:38:10,618 --> 00:38:11,418
Ahem!

698
00:38:12,269 --> 00:38:12,980
What?

699
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:21,688
Plearn.

700
00:38:22,018 --> 00:38:23,511
I have to go now.

701
00:38:24,243 --> 00:38:25,380
Get well soon.

702
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,691
Thank you for visiting me.

703
00:38:30,659 --> 00:38:34,312
My heart is strong now, Tin.

704
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,031
Yes.

705
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,300
I'll go now.

706
00:38:39,808 --> 00:38:40,360
Bye.

707
00:38:50,459 --> 00:38:51,001
Park.

708
00:38:51,026 --> 00:38:51,492
Huh?

709
00:38:52,105 --> 00:38:54,710
I can come to you without
being scolded, right?

710
00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:56,125
Yeah.

711
00:38:57,087 --> 00:38:58,411
I want you here every day.

712
00:39:00,015 --> 00:39:03,481
I'm glad you can
get out of that.

713
00:39:04,857 --> 00:39:07,035
You held on too long.

714
00:39:13,891 --> 00:39:16,460
I will let go ofeverything.

715
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:20,297
What?

716
00:39:21,062 --> 00:39:22,288
Just...

717
00:39:24,072 --> 00:39:25,648
I let go of everything to hug you.
