00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,300
(Tin Tem Jai)
(Episode 7)

2
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:42,860
Park.

3
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,380
I am...

4
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,427
the cause of your
father's death.

5
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,710
Park.

6
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,140
I don't mean that.

7
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,550
I'm not saying you're wrong.

8
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,270
I'm sorry.

9
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:00,790
Park.

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,170
I'm sorry.

11
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,590
Just face me and talk to me.

12
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,530
Don't pull that kind of face!

13
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,350
You can take my dad.

14
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:10,760
I gave him to you.

15
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,150
I won't take Uncle Keng away from you.

16
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,110
You can't take him away.

17
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,080
Someone had taken him a long time ago.

18
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,750
Park.

19
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,830
Uncle Keng still loves you.

20
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,030
I don't know what you and
Uncle Keng are angry about.

21
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,730
But you can't forgive him?

22
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,070
Because my dad laughed...

23
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,100
at my mom's funeral.

24
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,640
My dad was laughing with that woman

25
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,820
in front of my mom.

26
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:10,200
I don't understand why my dad
was happy the day my mom died.

27
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,350
I told him to hurry to see
my mom before she died.

28
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:19,990
He told me that

29
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,070
even if I rushed there,

30
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,860
I wouldn't be able to do anything.

31
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,560
I didn't want him
to do anything.

32
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,730
I just wanted my mom to
see his face for the last time.

33
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,190
Before she died.

34
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,710
She missed him until the last day.

35
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,790
You know how much she loved him.

36
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,670
I pity her.

37
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,070
I'm sorry for not understanding you.

38
00:04:09,974 --> 00:04:11,384
I'm sorry.

39
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:48,730
Hmm?

40
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,610
Is it sweet?

41
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:56,270
Yeah.

42
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:03,970
Who is he?

43
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,240
Huh?

44
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,610
The owner of the mini
car that drove you just now.

45
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,040
He was the senior I met
him at the bubble tea shop.

46
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,440
You said you didn't know him, didn't you?

47
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,360
I know him now.

48
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,220
His name is Plearn Ta.

49
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,650
He is in his final
year studying Thai art.

50
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,980
He flirts with you?

51
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,610
I think so.

52
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,010
You don't have any problems with it?

53
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,470
Are you jealous of me?

54
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:40,410
Park.

55
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,490
If you keep being
cold to me like this,

56
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,840
my heart may actually
come to love someone else.

57
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,890
Up to you.

58
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,710
Would you like to give it a try?

59
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,600
No.

60
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,180
I'm afraid to fall.

61
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,600
It's okay.

62
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,860
Hold my hand.

63
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:30,720
Let's go.

64
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,870
Let's start with this one.

65
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:36,980
Well.

66
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,200
I can use any leg, right?

67
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:38,930
Yes.

68
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:39,810
Slowly.

69
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,070
Try it slowly.

70
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:44,970
Okay.

71
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,910
Good.

72
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:46,920
Shall we go?

73
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,610
Be careful.

74
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,300
Okay.

75
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,980
It's harder than I thought.

76
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,900
When I played for the first
time, I fell and my mouth cracked.

77
00:06:58,970 --> 00:06:59,600
Hey.

78
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,520
I didn't want my mouth cracked.

79
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,530
That's why I'm holding your hand.

80
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,150
Be careful.

81
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,050
Let's go this way.

82
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,420
I think it's too hard for me.

83
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,840
It's okay.

84
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,300
Let's try again.

85
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,050
Hey!

86
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,870
Let's try again.

87
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,170
Okay.

88
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:43,780
Be careful.

89
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,890
Okay.

90
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,530
Good.

91
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,700
My heart, I tell you to calm down.

92
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,320
Let's try again?

93
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,240
Let's try again.

94
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:03,820
Okay.

95
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,940
You can do it right now.

96
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,390
Park.

97
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,300
Why did you come home early today?

98
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,330
What do you mean?

99
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,910
What time is it now?

100
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,740
I went skateboarding with Plearn Ta.

101
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,580
I forgot to check the time.

102
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,000
Didn't we already agree that
we shouldn't come home late?

103
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,370
I'm sorry.

104
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,050
Oh? Plearn.

105
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,850
This is your drawing pad.

106
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,850
I was worried that you
needed it, so I brought it.

107
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,090
Thank you.

108
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,640
I caused trouble, making
you drive here again.

109
00:09:03,392 --> 00:09:06,342
I'm glad to see your face again.

110
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,200
Yeah.

111
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,970
See you later.

112
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,390
Bye bye.

113
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:19,840
Park!

114
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,480
Park!

115
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:31,276
Why?

116
00:10:31,755 --> 00:10:34,015
Can you get up and talk to me?

117
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,510
I'm very sleepy.

118
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,560
You didn't shower first?

119
00:10:40,042 --> 00:10:41,262
I'll take a shower later.

120
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:43,037
But...

121
00:10:43,062 --> 00:10:44,262
Can I sleep first?

122
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,600
Okay. Okay.

123
00:10:53,297 --> 00:10:55,457
You must eat some food.

124
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,960
I'll eat later.

125
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,840
Why are you sitting here?

126
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,360
You don't need to
pay attention to me.

127
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,450
But you're sitting for
attention in my room.

128
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,110
I didn't ask for attention.

129
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,820
I'm just sitting.

130
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,140
You’re getting on my last nerve.

131
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,450
So can you get up and talk to me nicely?

132
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:34,570
Why?

133
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,500
What is your business?

134
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,510
What's wrong with you?

135
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,390
You don't pay attention to me these days.

136
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,820
We rarely talk together.

137
00:11:43,465 --> 00:11:44,945
I'm talking to you right now

138
00:11:45,423 --> 00:11:47,353
Can you talk to me nicely?

139
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:50,259
You act like you're
annoyed by me all the time.

140
00:11:50,786 --> 00:11:52,306
I'm not annoyed with you.

141
00:11:52,616 --> 00:11:53,446
I'm sleepy!

142
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,150
How long will you be like this?

143
00:12:04,368 --> 00:12:06,008
How long will you upset me?

144
00:12:06,404 --> 00:12:06,954
Okay!

145
00:12:09,066 --> 00:12:10,526
I won't bother you anymore.

146
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,910
Oh? Tin.

147
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,040
What's going on?

148
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,590
Nothing.

149
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,710
If you want to poop,
just go to the bathroom.

150
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,910
Why are you holding it in?

151
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,230
It's not about that.

152
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:40,170
What happened?
I saw that you were depressed since morning.

153
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,480
Park doesn't love me anymore.

154
00:12:46,776 --> 00:12:48,326
When did Park love you?

155
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:49,750
Wow?

156
00:12:49,876 --> 00:12:53,256
Why don't you just poke my face if
you're gonna say things like that...

157
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,930
Gosh...

158
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,110
What did he do to you?

159
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,290
Please tell me.

160
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,690
He might work late into the night.

161
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,150
Eat.

162
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,420
Working late at night.

163
00:13:03,326 --> 00:13:05,736
But he has been working the morning shift for two days.

164
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:07,271
Is he still sleepy?

165
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,440
Everyone wants to rest.

166
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,470
Working people.

167
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,310
Even when we are not working,
we still want to rest.

168
00:13:14,363 --> 00:13:15,743
It's because you're lazy.

169
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,690
Park is sleepier than before.

170
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,110
He's more sleepy now than ever before.

171
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,930
He was so sleepy that he didn't eat anything.

172
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,130
Also, he doesn't look at me.

173
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,330
Is he angry with you?

174
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,160
Park has never been angry with me
for more than a day.

175
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,040
Then you don't need to worry.
Maybe he needs a rest.

176
00:13:41,623 --> 00:13:42,073
Tin!

177
00:13:42,464 --> 00:13:43,944
Someone bought this for you.

178
00:13:46,887 --> 00:13:48,087
Let me see.

179
00:13:54,215 --> 00:13:56,815
He made a pattern like a mural like this.

180
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,790
Is he worried that people don't know
that they study Thai art?

181
00:14:05,568 --> 00:14:08,038
Drink milk rather than soda.

182
00:14:08,496 --> 00:14:09,556
Wow.

183
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:12,139
One person ignores you.

184
00:14:12,164 --> 00:14:13,914
Another person is very interested in you.

185
00:14:14,915 --> 00:14:16,475
If I don't accept his love.

186
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:18,721
Will he be sad?

187
00:14:19,244 --> 00:14:21,144
You care too much about other people.

188
00:14:21,732 --> 00:14:24,232
You tend to think for other people.

189
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,610
Also, you tend to be considerate of others.

190
00:14:26,635 --> 00:14:27,215
Yes.

191
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,215
Caring for others is a good thing.

192
00:14:29,575 --> 00:14:32,715
But it's you who have to bear other people's feelings.

193
00:14:33,154 --> 00:14:35,064
If you don't have feelings for him,
just tell him honestly.

194
00:14:35,638 --> 00:14:37,108
Isn't it too mean?

195
00:14:37,234 --> 00:14:39,794
If you don't have feelings for him
and don't tell him anything.

196
00:14:40,063 --> 00:14:41,353
He's going to
imagine everything.

197
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,717
That's really mean.

198
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:45,340
However, you have to tell him directly.

199
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,920
The sooner you tell him,
the quicker he'll give up.

200
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:51,015
But the milk looks so delicious.

201
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:52,108
Can I drink the bottle?

202
00:14:53,069 --> 00:14:54,139
Take it.

203
00:14:57,706 --> 00:14:58,566
You don't drink it?

204
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,730
This brand's homemade milk is really delicious.

205
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:03,092
Really?

206
00:15:03,117 --> 00:15:04,007
Yes, try it.

207
00:15:11,363 --> 00:15:12,403
What milk is it?

208
00:15:12,464 --> 00:15:13,604
Why does it taste weird?

209
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:15,669
It's almond milk.

210
00:15:15,694 --> 00:15:16,774
You never drank it?

211
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,660
If people are allergic to almonds,

212
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,050
can they drink almond milk?

213
00:15:23,658 --> 00:15:26,908
You think almond milk is made from lentils?

214
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:27,950
Huh?

215
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,570
I'm allergic to almonds.

216
00:15:32,803 --> 00:15:33,533
Huh?

217
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:42,991
I heard your name.

218
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,440
I drank almond milk.

219
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,270
Come here.

220
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,580
You can't wait.

221
00:15:55,762 --> 00:15:56,302
Tin.

222
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,500
Why is your heart beating fast?

223
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,590
Tin.

224
00:16:01,132 --> 00:16:02,768
Are you afraid of syringes?

225
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,810
No.

226
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,140
You are awesome.

227
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:06,905
It doesn't hurt.

228
00:16:07,177 --> 00:16:07,907
It's like an ant bite.

229
00:16:13,683 --> 00:16:17,223
You have to wait for a condition check
after the doctor injects you.

230
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:19,549
Just tell me your symptoms.

231
00:16:20,463 --> 00:16:21,023
Okay?

232
00:16:21,207 --> 00:16:21,767
Okay.

233
00:16:22,063 --> 00:16:23,043
Thank you.

234
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:27,499
When Aunt Phawinee got sick,

235
00:16:28,057 --> 00:16:31,797
Park told me that if he was a nurse, he would
be able to take care of his mom for sure.

236
00:16:32,745 --> 00:16:34,375
So he decided to study nursing.

237
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,532
Park has taken good care of Aunt Phawinee

238
00:16:37,753 --> 00:16:38,973
until the last day.

239
00:16:45,461 --> 00:16:47,251
Park is really cool, right?

240
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,460
Please take care of him.

241
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,410
Okay.

242
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:50,930
Don't worry.

243
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,460
I'll take care of him.

244
00:17:11,171 --> 00:17:13,180
Tin has been in that room for a long time.

245
00:17:14,093 --> 00:17:15,253
He will be fine.

246
00:17:15,654 --> 00:17:16,854
The doctor is treating him.

247
00:17:18,216 --> 00:17:19,046
I'm worried about him, don't you think?

248
00:17:20,961 --> 00:17:21,911
Are you okay now?

249
00:17:23,018 --> 00:17:24,128
I'm fine now.

250
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,090
I was shocked when I heard your name.

251
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:30,630
I know.

252
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,230
Your face looks like a shocked sloth.

253
00:17:34,307 --> 00:17:35,617
Because I'm worried about you.

254
00:17:36,235 --> 00:17:37,595
Do I have to get sick first?

255
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,820
To make you pay attention to me.

256
00:17:40,027 --> 00:17:40,657
What?

257
00:17:41,655 --> 00:17:44,045
Earlier you said you annoyed me.

258
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:47,336
I need to be a
patient like this, right?

259
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:48,960
To make you pay attention to me.

260
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,380
Why do you drink almond milk?

261
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,740
You know you're allergic to it.

262
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,510
I didn't know it was almond milk.

263
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,390
Also, I don't remember the taste of it.

264
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,850
I haven't drank it for a long time.

265
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,070
Don't argue with me.

266
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,160
I'm not wrong.

267
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,150
Stop it.

268
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,830
Hey, Tin.

269
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,020
How are you?

270
00:18:11,831 --> 00:18:13,331
I'm fine now.

271
00:18:15,034 --> 00:18:15,774
Really?

272
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,530
It's good that you've recovered.

273
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,390
Let's go.

274
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:22,860
I bought it for you.

275
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,200
Give him it all.

276
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,390
Eat it and rest to help
you recover quickly.

277
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,870
Thank you.

278
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,790
Bie.

279
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,520
Let's eat.

280
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,520
Just a moment.

281
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,520
What are they talking about?

282
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:47,880
I can't hear it.

283
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,520
I'm really sorry to you, Tin.

284
00:18:52,545 --> 00:18:54,545
You don't need to apologize to me, Plearn.

285
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:59,020
I even found out today that
I was allergic to one of the medicines.

286
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:07,510
Because someone knows me very well.

287
00:19:09,098 --> 00:19:15,324
He's the one that I thought didn't care
about me, in the way that I cared about him.

288
00:19:16,682 --> 00:19:18,722
But actually he remembers every detail about me.

289
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:22,370
You mean your brother, right?

290
00:19:24,292 --> 00:19:24,742
Yes.

291
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,880
He's more special.

292
00:19:32,342 --> 00:19:34,262
You're going to tell me that...

293
00:19:51,449 --> 00:19:53,215
Am I doing too much?

294
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,400
I'm too deliberate,
right? So it's not destiny.

295
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:58,310
Yes.

296
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,690
It probably wasn't meant to be.

297
00:20:08,101 --> 00:20:09,001
Plearn.

298
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:11,886
Don't be silent like this.

299
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,950
I'm managing my feelings

300
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,680
about what I need to do next.

301
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,390
I was just heartbroken for the first time.

302
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,530
I'm in a dilemma.

303
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,980
Keep fighting, heart.

304
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,130
Your owner is a very nice person.

305
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,140
He must definitely meet someone better than me.

306
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,730
But you have to be patient during this time.

307
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,170
I know you can get through it.

308
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,970
You're...

309
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,940
You broke my heart

310
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,980
and still being cute towards me.

311
00:20:58,431 --> 00:20:59,331
You're bad.

312
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,310
So bad.

313
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,020
I'm sorry.

314
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,560
You don't need to feel guilty about me.

315
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,310
I can manage my feelings.

316
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,390
I will be responsible for all my feelings.

317
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,340
You don't need to worry about it.

318
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,000
That friend

319
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,750
looks really worried about you, right?

320
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:36,380
When he told me that he went to the hospital
and couldn't find you,

321
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,030
he came to wait for you at home.

322
00:21:40,787 --> 00:21:42,801
Is he the person you met at the food court?

323
00:21:48,924 --> 00:21:50,184
Did he...

324
00:21:51,459 --> 00:21:52,509
really flirt with you?

325
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,499
What do you think, Park?

326
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,400
Park didn't say anything about it.

327
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,640
Aren't you jealous of him a bit?

328
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:09,640
I'm not jealous of him.

329
00:22:11,601 --> 00:22:13,341
But I'm not giving him to him.

330
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,850
You kept saying that he was flirting with you.

331
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:15,740
Why do you say it?

332
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,240
He's flirting with you, so what's next?

333
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,640
You will like him?

334
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,200
I'm not giving you to him.

335
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,360
I cherished him for a long time.

336
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,680
How can I give him to someone else?

337
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,240
Who does he think he is?

338
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,610
Call him here!

339
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:29,900
Let's talk clearly.

340
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,710
That day you said it was up to me.

341
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,880
My brain couldn't figure out how I had to respond.

342
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,790
At that time I still didn't
know how to process things.

343
00:22:41,347 --> 00:22:45,327
If you don't think it through,
you could've told me a couple days later.

344
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,970
I always wait for you.

345
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,190
The way you say that makes me sad.

346
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,160
You don't think I'm being sarcastic towards you?

347
00:22:54,222 --> 00:22:57,502
Does my face look pleased with you?

348
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,050
Huh?

349
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,330
Your face is always the same.

350
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,000
How do I know?

351
00:23:11,462 --> 00:23:12,442
Is it flowing yet?

352
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:13,560
Huh?

353
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:18,830
Has your heart grown to love someone else?
And if it's already flowing?

354
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,790
If it's already flowing.

355
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:35,120
I'm worried about you until I'm about to cry.

356
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,000
Park.

357
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:46,860
Hmm?

358
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,880
Do you love me?

359
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:49,940
Yes.

360
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,900
You answer me just like this?

361
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:55,860
I just love you.

362
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,570
Will you let me deny it?

363
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,880
You love me like a brother,

364
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,470
do you love me like that?

365
00:24:09,483 --> 00:24:11,417
I thought so at first.

366
00:24:12,186 --> 00:24:13,256
But it's not.

367
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:22,210
I think we are brothers. So I can't
imagine how we could love each other.

368
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,960
Before,

369
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,450
I never had feelings for you like this.

370
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,910
A brother is a brother.

371
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,540
How can I have more feelings for you?

372
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,900
But as you grow up,

373
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,770
everything changes.

374
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:49,800
You suddenly become prettier.

375
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:57,750
Suddenly my heart
fluttered because of you.

376
00:24:59,861 --> 00:25:07,981
I suddenly want to hug you like a lover.

377
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,060
When I had feelings for you,

378
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:15,860
I realized that I was in trouble.

379
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:20,102
Because we grew up together.

380
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:25,550
So I don't know if we
can really love each other.

381
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:34,182
So I don't know if the two
of us can really get married

382
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,060
like you ask every day.

383
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:44,220
So I said I didn't understand
what marriage meant.

384
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:49,920
My brain is always in
conflict with my heart.

385
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,910
I'm afraid

386
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:57,200
we're both doing something wrong.

387
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:20,800
So I try to tell and try to make you stop
having feelings for me.

388
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,380
And me too.

389
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:27,730
I have to think that today it's good.

390
00:26:35,482 --> 00:26:36,012
Park.

391
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:36,670
Look at this.

392
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,589
I got a lot of roses.

393
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,260
And then I got candy too.

394
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,590
Look at this lollipop.

395
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,280
Am I hot?

396
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,970
You're ridiculous.

397
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,800
I'll give you a rose. Do you want it?

398
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,480
No.

399
00:26:53,818 --> 00:26:54,478
Here's all of them.

400
00:26:56,504 --> 00:26:57,444
Just go take a shower.

401
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:06,470
I must have hurt your
feelings a lot in the past.

402
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,790
You're right...

403
00:27:12,301 --> 00:27:13,481
but I can endure it.

404
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:18,160
I'm mean to make you stop
you from having feelings for me,

405
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,520
why do you have to endure it?

406
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:33,660
You are worthy enough
to make me endure it.

407
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,440
Park.

408
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:37,130
Hmm?

409
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:41,070
Can you say you
love me nicely for once?

410
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,490
I love you, babe.

411
00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:00,800
The way you say this can kill me.

412
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:06,730
You were the one who made the first move.

413
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,430
Being that I'm serious,
does it make you die?

414
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,510
Why do you have to
say that I'm a total flirt?

415
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:15,750
It's a fact.

416
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,030
You seduce me every day.

417
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,240
How much do you think I can endure?

418
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:20,940
Huh?

419
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,510
But you can endure it.

420
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,470
You keep looking to kick me every day.

421
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,200
Have I really kicked you once?

422
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:35,850
Huh?

423
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,220
Until you know your feelings...

424
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,290
You'd rather make me wait a long time.

425
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,230
Are you teasing me?

426
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:28,850
Why?

427
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:29,950
Why?

428
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:31,290
Why?

429
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:32,800
Are you fluttering?

430
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,290
Here, cold water.

431
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:41,980
Thank you.

432
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,550
Bie.

433
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,500
Where did Kana's family go?

434
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:51,530
Oh, Aunt Mam goes to practice Dharma.

435
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,940
Aunt Kai was drunk at his friend's house as usual.

436
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,080
Oh?

437
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,080
What about Kana?

438
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,080
He went with his mother.

439
00:30:01,378 --> 00:30:02,928
Kana went to the temple?

440
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:03,760
Yeah.

441
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:06,070
A monster like him can enter the temple?

442
00:30:07,537 --> 00:30:10,477
He was unusually good these days.

443
00:30:10,562 --> 00:30:13,052
He waits to make merit
and gives alms to monks in the morning.

444
00:30:13,527 --> 00:30:16,587
I think he might ordain next year.

445
00:30:17,138 --> 00:30:17,868
Ordain?

446
00:30:18,551 --> 00:30:22,611
I can't imagine Kana as a monk.

447
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:23,709
Yes.

448
00:30:23,953 --> 00:30:25,063
Me too.

449
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:29,442
From Kana (Kale) to carrots
(The colour of monk garbs)?

450
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,290
It's just water here.

451
00:30:38,362 --> 00:30:39,912
Shall we go buy some bubble tea?

452
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,720
Hey, okay!

453
00:30:42,283 --> 00:30:43,093
Would you like to go with us, Park?

454
00:30:43,645 --> 00:30:44,815
Okay.

455
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,480
Come on.

456
00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:52,779
Jumbo!

457
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:54,240
Hey.

458
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:55,580
You puppy.

459
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,910
You scared me.

460
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:57,630
Hey.

461
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,630
You always tease me.

462
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:00,080
Huh?

463
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,560
What's wrong with you?
Why are you holding my hand?

464
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:07,200
Is your sleep normal?

465
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,420
It's normal.

466
00:31:09,445 --> 00:31:10,035
Why?

467
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,690
Are you still smoking?

468
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,410
Sometimes.

469
00:31:14,718 --> 00:31:16,348
Are you still drinking alcohol?

470
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:17,720
Yeah.

471
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,790
All the time. Why?

472
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,910
You haven't had any strange
symptoms lately, have you?

473
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,360
No, I'm fine.

474
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:23,610
But you are a strange person.

475
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:24,880
What's wrong with you?

476
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,370
Are you worried that
people won't know you're a nurse?

477
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,560
You check my pulse.

478
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,350
Bie.

479
00:31:31,617 --> 00:31:32,037
Oh...

480
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:32,970
Oh!

481
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:34,250
It looks like it's going to rain today, right?

482
00:31:34,275 --> 00:31:35,305
It looks like it's going to rain.

483
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:37,204
So sunny.

484
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:38,617
Bie.

485
00:31:38,987 --> 00:31:41,337
How did Uncle Manop tell you?

486
00:31:42,012 --> 00:31:45,092
About the debt with Uncle Montri.

487
00:31:45,397 --> 00:31:46,347
What?

488
00:31:47,961 --> 00:31:50,561
Your father borrowed
money from Uncle Montri.

489
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,110
I heard that your father
took the land as collateral.

490
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,580
It looks like Uncle Montri
needs money lately.

491
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,400
So he will sell that plot of land.

492
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:00,710
I never knew about this before.

493
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,670
Your father didn't tell you anything?

494
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,830
Since when?

495
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:09,630
When...

496
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:15,680
Since your father sent you to study abroad.

497
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,720
Your father has been using the land
as collateral for 6-7 years.

498
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,570
Let's go back.

499
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,680
Jumbo, I have to go.

500
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,120
Dad!

501
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,120
Dad!

502
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,250
Dad!

503
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,120
Pyrin, where is our dad?

504
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,770
Dad!

505
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,570
Uncle Manop!

506
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,290
Dad!

507
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,200
Uncle Manop!

508
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,510
What?

509
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,250
What are you guys doing here?

510
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:49,040
It's already evening,
why aren't you home yet?

511
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,440
I thought you fainted to death at the farm.

512
00:32:51,465 --> 00:32:52,075
Hey.

513
00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:53,909
Is that your mouth?

514
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,400
Why haven't you come back home yet?

515
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,110
Can you see that my work is not finished yet?

516
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,380
Why are you making me hurry?

517
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,660
We need to talk, dad.

518
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:05,460
Why then do you have to borrow other people's money?

519
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:08,440
If you tell me one time that you don't have money,

520
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,710
I would've never gone to study.

521
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,040
I saw that you wanted to go there.

522
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,530
It's a pity if you pass the exam
but don't have any money.

523
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,580
And you seem happy.

524
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,460
What do you want me to do?

525
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,840
Just because of my happiness?

526
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,140
You must use the
land to pay off the debt.

527
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,360
Is it the right thing, dad?

528
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,270
Of course.

529
00:33:26,555 --> 00:33:30,445
How am I going to be your father
if I can't do little things for you?

530
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:33,709
Okay, I'll pay the debt for you.

531
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:34,920
You don't have to do it.

532
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,410
What?

533
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,020
Just keep your money.

534
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,320
Use that money to make your future.

535
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,160
You don't have to pay debts for me.

536
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,850
Why can't I pay off your debt?

537
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,010
Isn't this debt from me?

538
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,770
You think I don't have money.

539
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,710
So you have a lot of money?

540
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:51,370
Huh?

541
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,550
I told you that I can work
and earn money every day.

542
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:59,000
You kept telling me to take the civil service exam.

543
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,310
I just want you to have a great future.

544
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,790
I don't want you to be a farmer like me.

545
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,570
Just doing good work to make money.

546
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,000
It's for your life.

547
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:10,890
Just talk about it later

548
00:34:11,045 --> 00:34:13,731
about this country
where there are many jobs

549
00:34:13,755 --> 00:34:16,440
other than civil servants
that can earn money.

550
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:21,370
But now you should give money
back to Uncle Montri first.

551
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,570
But it's your money.

552
00:34:24,356 --> 00:34:26,846
I can do anything with my money.

553
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:32,232
Or you must not complain to me
if I pay for idols or expenses after this.

554
00:34:32,257 --> 00:34:33,457
Because it's my money.

555
00:34:34,013 --> 00:34:35,623
You're really complicated.

556
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,620
It's a fact, isn't it?

557
00:34:38,263 --> 00:34:40,196
You kept forcing me to
take the civil service exam.

558
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:42,278
Civil service jobs are
not suitable for everyone.

559
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:43,728
Yes, uncle.

560
00:34:44,474 --> 00:34:46,224
Don't let Bie be like Pao.

561
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,200
I don't have a higher education like you guys.

562
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,710
I don't know what job is stable.

563
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:57,970
An old man like me knows only good
and right civil service work.

564
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:00,884
You use sad words with me.

565
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,280
It's good for you.

566
00:35:03,464 --> 00:35:04,824
I'm grown up.

567
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,040
You should stop complaining to me.

568
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,910
The fact that I like Korean idols,

569
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,810
even you put Tata
Young's posters on the wall.

570
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:19,700
Don't think I don't remember
you liking singers either.

571
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,180
You still remember it.

572
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,520
Bie.

573
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:43,650
I'm sorry that I always ended
up being a point of comparison.

574
00:35:44,126 --> 00:35:45,696
Actually, you didn't do anything wrong.

575
00:35:45,721 --> 00:35:47,511
I'm just born with perfection.

576
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:50,290
I'm not as good as you think.

577
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:54,830
And I'm not as good as other people think.

578
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:06,690
Hey, I think now my dad knows that
my career can earn money.

579
00:36:08,632 --> 00:36:11,512
I just realized how rich you are.

580
00:36:11,537 --> 00:36:14,167
I don't go anywhere every day.
I rarely travel anywhere.

581
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,290
Also, my father never asked me for money.

582
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:19,450
He kept telling me to save money.
So I have some savings.

583
00:36:20,076 --> 00:36:21,276
Your dad loves you.

584
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,700
I know.

585
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,330
I love him too.

586
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:30,950
But sometimes he messes with me too much.

587
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:38,490
But now I know that he gave everything to me.

588
00:36:38,817 --> 00:36:40,237
He traded land

589
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,680
to make me happy.

590
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,690
I'm speechless.

591
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:51,195
Even though he's not my real father.

592
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:51,670
Huh?

593
00:36:53,385 --> 00:36:53,985
Oh.

594
00:36:54,283 --> 00:36:55,243
You were born late, right?

595
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,360
Park never told you about it?

596
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:03,910
My mom and he got married when I was a kid.

597
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,010
But she died before.

598
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,680
So my dad has always raised me since then.

599
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,960
He really didn't need
to be go so hard to raise me.

600
00:37:15,923 --> 00:37:17,523
I want to make him proud.

601
00:37:18,033 --> 00:37:18,603
But...

602
00:37:19,473 --> 00:37:22,133
I want to be successful in my own way.

603
00:37:22,835 --> 00:37:25,625
And I will repay him in my ways.

604
00:37:27,416 --> 00:37:29,066
You are doing it right now.

605
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,420
Park.

606
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,250
Huh?

607
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,370
Have you ever thought about what
job you want me to do in the future?

608
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,220
You have to think about it yourself.

609
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:56,430
I don't even know what I want to do.

610
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,140
What I'm good at.

611
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:02,270
What I can do well.

612
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,530
I really don't know.

613
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,570
I'm a very normal person.

614
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,770
I'm so normal that I can't find my true self.

615
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,720
If I don't achieve anything.

616
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,440
If I can't make you proud.

617
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,640
Have I ever scolded you for this reason?

618
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,330
No.

619
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,100
The person who says
you're not good is yourself.

620
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:31,360
If you don't know what you want to be,

621
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,480
just slowly think about it.

622
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,590
Success doesn't have to be great.

623
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,020
Just do what you want to do.

624
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,600
Just do what you like.

625
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,340
You don't have to think
about whether I like it or not.

626
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,030
I still fully support you anyway.

627
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,600
If you are not good yet.

628
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,190
If it's not good,
you just make it better.

629
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:02,610
But if you keep saying you're not good

630
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,480
and doing nothing,

631
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:05,800
I'll scold you.

632
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,080
Okay.

633
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,980
I will try harder.

634
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:11,190
Yeah.

635
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:16,072
Actually, you're not normal.

636
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:27,040
For me,

637
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,860
you are a special one.
