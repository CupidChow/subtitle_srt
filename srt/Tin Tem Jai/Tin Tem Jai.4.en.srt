(Tin Tem Jai)
(Episode 4)

2
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,940
Hi, Pink?

3
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,390
Happy birthday again, Tin.

4
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,390
Huh? You haven't woken up yet?

5
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,350
It's late now.

6
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,580
I just woke up.

7
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,400
Oh? Why are you awake so late?

8
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,400
Park!

9
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,230
What are you doing to me?

10
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,000
Oh? Hold on.

11
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,160
Is that Park?

12
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,700
Wait. Why are you guys together so early in the morning?

13
00:02:16,415 --> 00:02:18,165
Or maybe last night, you...

14
00:02:18,425 --> 00:02:20,265
Hey, it's not like that...

15
00:02:20,424 --> 00:02:21,694
Don't take it any further.

16
00:02:22,028 --> 00:02:24,188
Why are you secretly having something so hot, Tin?

17
00:02:24,825 --> 00:02:26,295
It's not what you think.

18
00:02:26,923 --> 00:02:28,953
Park got drunk last night.

19
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,690
So I took Park to his room.

20
00:02:32,626 --> 00:02:34,286
I just fell asleep after taking care of him.

21
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,909
Did you guys... together last night?

22
00:02:39,499 --> 00:02:40,499
Ouch!

23
00:02:40,846 --> 00:02:42,106
What could we do?

24
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:46,015
At least you can sleep next to him.

25
00:02:46,355 --> 00:02:48,155
I'm not surprised you woke up late.

26
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,850
But will you eat with us today?

27
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:54,345
Of course.

28
00:02:56,255 --> 00:02:57,815
Good boy...

29
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,680
Park's voice is so sexy.

30
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:03,348
Stop it.

31
00:03:03,425 --> 00:03:04,185
I'll hang up now.

32
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,511
Romeo.

33
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,738
Eat a lot.

34
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:22,304
Grow up quickly.

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,800
Even when you dream, you only dream of Romeo.

36
00:03:29,817 --> 00:03:30,677
In here.

37
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:33,351
In your heart.

38
00:03:34,807 --> 00:03:36,247
Do you have me in here?

39
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:38,979
Do you miss Romeo

40
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,620
or its mother?

41
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:01,169
Name.

42
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:03,341
Are you okay, Name?

43
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:04,851
Are you sick?

44
00:04:05,085 --> 00:04:06,855
You're smiling alone for a long time.

45
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:09,827
What are you happy about? Tell me.

46
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,600
Tell me.

47
00:04:12,176 --> 00:04:14,016
I'm so happy...

48
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:16,327
because of you.

49
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:21,463
So my heart is like...

50
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:25,530
Really?

51
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,130
I can't believe it.

52
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,960
What do you want me to do?

53
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,480
Or will you copy my homework?

54
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:34,589
Are you sick?

55
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,170
Your brain is messed up.

56
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:41,133
I don't want to be number one.

57
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,210
But can I be your only one?

58
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,480
Huh?

59
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,430
Just order food.

60
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,410
Park!

61
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,230
Shall we go eat?

62
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,440
I'll go with my friends if you don't go.

63
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,600
Tin!

64
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:07,340
Huh?

65
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,000
I am hungry.

66
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,640
Shall we go eat?

67
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,750
Why didn't you answer me just now?

68
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,980
I just realized.

69
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,670
You're a sloth.

70
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,410
But I made an appointment with Pink.

71
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,460
Then... you can go with your friends.

72
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,040
Just leave me alone.

73
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,260
I can live alone.

74
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,370
I can live with Romeo.

75
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,240
We can eat together.

76
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,020
Right? Romeo.

77
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,320
Right?

78
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:40,920
Huh?

79
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,490
You're really...

80
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,330
Hello, Pink.

81
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,740
I can't go now.

82
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,960
Can you go with Donut and Name?

83
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,880
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,520
See you later.

85
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:01,930
Okay.

86
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,430
Romeo, shall we eat together?

87
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:05,930
Okay?

88
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,170
Right?

89
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,120
We're together, okay?

90
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:09,970
Huh?

91
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,870
We can eat together, right?

92
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,090
Are you ready?

93
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,510
Okay, let's go.

94
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,550
I'm very full.

95
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,370
You ate a lot.

96
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,670
Why are you eating so much when you're so small?

97
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,920
You can't treat me?

98
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,650
I can.

99
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,600
I'm going to buy one for Bie.

100
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,200
Bie came back from her concert?

101
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,610
Oh.

102
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,460
You're right.

103
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,630
So can we buy it for Kana?

104
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,690
No.

105
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,240
Kana always annoys me.

106
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,820
He has bad habits too.

107
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,570
He was even addicted to drugs.

108
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,560
He has stopped it right now.

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,220
I don't want to get him anything.

110
00:06:59,902 --> 00:07:02,032
Why do you guys always quarrel?

111
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,090
Kana always annoys me.

112
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,960
I'm bored of him.

113
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,720
The keychain he gave you is also cute.

114
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,500
It's cute.

115
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,190
So I use it.

116
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,070
Kana is not a bad person.

117
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,600
Don't hate him.

118
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,960
How was your college life?

119
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,400
Can you choose your major?

120
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,640
Not yet.

121
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,400
I had to ask my mom if she could afford it.

122
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,170
Because the cost of materials is expensive.

123
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,950
Besides, I don't want my mother
to suffer to give me money to study.

124
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,290
Actually, just study what you want to study.

125
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,240
You don't need to worry about it.

126
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,640
I have a long time to think.

127
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,080
I need some time to think.

128
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,330
Okay.

129
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,220
Do you want to try?

130
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,560
I want to taste it. You eat it deliciously.

131
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,480
Park!

132
00:08:09,903 --> 00:08:11,003
I want to drink bubble tea.

133
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,300
You drank yesterday, didn't you?

134
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,180
But yesterday I didn't try this shop~

135
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:16,990
No!

136
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,220
Hey.

137
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,650
But I'm not being extra this month.

138
00:08:22,337 --> 00:08:23,567
I'm not saying you're extra.

139
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:25,662
But drinking sugary drinks
every day isn't good.

140
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,580
You'll get diabetes.

141
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,760
I'll check your blood sugar.

142
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:31,320
Hey.

143
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,740
But I want to drink it.

144
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,720
Please?

145
00:08:35,795 --> 00:08:36,705
Please?

146
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,140
Hey.

147
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,160
I want to drink it.

148
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,690
Just one glass.

149
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,920
Please? Park.

150
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,580
Just one glass. Please?

151
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,810
Ouch! It hurts.

152
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,550
You don't listen
when I speak nicely.

153
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,800
I just want to drink bubble tea.

154
00:08:49,672 --> 00:08:51,072
Why do you have to be harsh with me?

155
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,050
Ouch...

156
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:55,390
Are you really hurt?

157
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:56,800
Of course.

158
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,160
I'm so small.

159
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,640
But your hands are as big as palm leaves.

160
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,240
I'm blown away even if
you use the slightest force.

161
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,220
Well. I'm sorry.

162
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,600
Ouch...

163
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,400
Ouch... it hurts.

164
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,310
I'm sorry.

165
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,280
I'd like a brown sugar milk tea,
two-color bubble special.

166
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,240
Just buy as much as you want.

167
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,240
Tin.

168
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:34,870
Oh.

169
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,290
I miss you, Tin.

170
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,160
I miss you too.

171
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,970
I want to learn drawing with you now, Tin.

172
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,530
I will make time for you.

173
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:46,410
Okay.

174
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:47,750
Tin.

175
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,560
I'm going to take her to her mother.

176
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,220
I'm going home now.

177
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:53,840
I'll go now. Bye bye.

178
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:54,930
Bye bye.

179
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,470
Let's go.

180
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,180
Let's go back to meet your mother.

181
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,630
Manow.

182
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,400
Eh? Was that Tin just now?

183
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,180
Yes.

184
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,640
Really?

185
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,750
Let's back to our home.

186
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,100
Is bubble tea delicious, dear?

187
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,100
Yes.

188
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,050
I will take you to buy again next time.

189
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,350
Thank you for taking
care of my child, Kana.

190
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,180
Yes.

191
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,420
Bye bye, Manow.

192
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,380
See you later.

193
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,010
Yes.

194
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,220
Let's go.

195
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,030
Let's back to our home.

196
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,150
Let's buy from here next time.

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,090
Hello, what would you like?

198
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,900
Now there is a promotion for 3 glasses of bubble tea
and free cheese baked bread.

199
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,200
Are you interested?

200
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,540
It's okay.

201
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,540
I want...

202
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,390
Do you want to buy with me?

203
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,730
I want to buy two glasses.

204
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,060
If we share, we get free bread.

205
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:56,980
Do you want it?

206
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,520
It's okay. I want...

207
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,180
Promotion menu, please.

208
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,240
Sure, please wait for a moment.

209
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,900
We met by chance again.

210
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,500
Yes. It's just a coincidence.

211
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,180
I almost used the word destiny.

212
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,350
Just kidding.

213
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,540
You study here?

214
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,140
Why are you suddenly calling me older?

215
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,040
Because this color of shirt is
the same as the faculty ones.

216
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,500
You study here?

217
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,570
Yes.

218
00:11:34,384 --> 00:11:36,970
You can consult me anytime.

219
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,200
Thank you.

220
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,690
You're...

221
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,620
Plearn.

222
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,480
My real name is Plearn Ta.

223
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,320
I'm Tin.

224
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:49,660
Tin...

225
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,190
My name is Pleang Rak.

226
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,390
Oh... yes.

227
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:03,790
Please take it, Tin.

228
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,860
Please think of this bread as encouragement from me.

229
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,980
Thank you.

230
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,100
Tin!

231
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,610
I hope we have a chance
to meet at university.

232
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,640
Hi, Park.

233
00:12:39,665 --> 00:12:41,665
What a coincidence. What
are you doing around here?

234
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,440
Because my house...

235
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,340
Because my house is around here.

236
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,090
Are you still using this motorcycle?

237
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,000
I think it's broken.

238
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,900
You've been using it since we were still...

239
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,080
It still works.

240
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,440
Yes. Are you still in the same house?

241
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,210
I sent a wedding invitation card. Did you get it?

242
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,460
I saw it.

243
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,820
But I was busy that day.

244
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,220
I'm sad that you didn't join.

245
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,460
Oh? You are Tin, right?

246
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,060
You've grown up a lot.

247
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,050
You're handsome too.

248
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,200
Yeah.

249
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,440
I'll go now, Park.

250
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,680
Let's meet if there is a chance.

251
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:34,670
Okay.

252
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,300
I'll go now, Tin.

253
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,100
Yes.

254
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,760
When she returned, they were arguing again.

255
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,060
Uncle was angry with Bie
because she went to the concert.

256
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,480
Uncle Manop already knew that, didn't he?

257
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,200
It's like this every time.

258
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,450
I'm hurt, dad!

259
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,820
Why do you argue with me?

260
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:58,900
Don't hurt her.

261
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,130
Don't mess with us.

262
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,200
Look at my daughter's stubbornness.

263
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,260
Bie is grown up, uncle.

264
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,610
She's grown up.

265
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,320
So I had to teach her.

266
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:13,180
I worked almost to death for
you to study at a good university.

267
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,630
I hope you come back to work.

268
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,310
But you just sit and sleep.

269
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,350
You're always crazy
about celebrities and singers.

270
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,500
I don't just sit and sleep.

271
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,350
I work and can earn money every day.

272
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,870
You're not young anymore.

273
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,630
Will you do this job
for the rest of your life?

274
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,200
Just look at Pao.

275
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,070
He has a more advanced job than you.

276
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,570
What happened to the
people in this community?

277
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,500
People kept saying that Pao was good like this and like that.

278
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,340
People kept saying that Pao, Pao and Pao!

279
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,380
It was because you couldn't find a great job like Pao.

280
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,960
If you want to do that job, why don't you do it yourself?

281
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,010
Bie.

282
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,050
Bie...

283
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:59,470
I wouldn't have any advantages in my father's eyes.

284
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,600
He just thinks I sit and sleep,
and not do any work.

285
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,080
Even though I'm working.

286
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,380
You earn a lot of money by selling things.

287
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,270
Those... sticks.

288
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,350
Glow sticks?

289
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,680
It's a light stick.

290
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:19,890
Yes. That's it.

291
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,950
And your translation work too.

292
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,380
You earn a lot of money.

293
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,040
But I'm not a civil servant.

294
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,540
So I couldn't make my
father proud in any way.

295
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:38,308
If Pao were my father's
son, it would be fine.

296
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:40,820
No.

297
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,980
Otherwise, the whole town
would want to have children like Pao.

298
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,380
It's true.

299
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:53,927
People say that Pao is
good no matter where I go.

300
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,870
Pao didn't do anything wrong.

301
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,540
Don't be angry with him.

302
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:05,820
Sometimes I just hate being compared.

303
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,240
If you're worse compared to Pao,

304
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,460
just compare to me.

305
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,210
I'm sure your life will be better.

306
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,310
Yes.

307
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,000
Thank you, Kana.

308
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,120
I wont cry anymore.

309
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,970
What's wrong with you?

310
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:51,840
Nothing.

311
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:53,440
I'm totally okay.

312
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,400
But your face doesn't look okay.

313
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,760
Can I be alone?

314
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,660
I'll tell you if I'm ready.

315
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,420
Okay.

316
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,240
Then I'll go now.

317
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:17,720
Why?

318
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,620
Can I hug you?

319
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,200
I don't know what happened to you.

320
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,070
But I want you to know that I am always by your side.

321
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,500
Yeah.

322
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,330
Cheers!

323
00:18:23,104 --> 00:18:25,364
Let's drink to the fullest today.

324
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,540
I will treat you guys.

325
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,150
Your voice is very loud, Bie.

326
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,100
Hey.

327
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:32,860
My ears are off.

328
00:18:33,251 --> 00:18:34,921
Will you drink until you throw up?

329
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,820
I'm sad, Park.

330
00:18:38,896 --> 00:18:40,436
Just today.

331
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,600
Yeah.

332
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,640
Pao didn't come today?

333
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,740
I invited him, but he told me he had a seminar at
school early in the morning, so he didn't come.

334
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,290
Didn't he see how sad I was?

335
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,700
He's just busy.

336
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,220
Come on.

337
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,760
I'll drink instead of him.

338
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,010
Bottoms up!

339
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,180
Hey.

340
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,430
Let's cheers.

341
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,620
Cheers!

342
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,730
Hey...

343
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,110
They both slept.

344
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,030
Then I'll go back.

345
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,250
Good bye.

346
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:33,820
Good bye.

347
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,050
Park.

348
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,280
You cannot sleep here.

349
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,060
I can't get up.

350
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,680
Park!

351
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,060
I can't carry you.

352
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,580
I said I couldn't get up.

353
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,000
So you can sleep right here.

354
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:49,070
Park, walk properly.

355
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,420
Ouch!

356
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:52,900
Oh?

357
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:53,810
Ouch!

358
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,090
Why did you bump me?

359
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,610
Park.

360
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,140
Sleep here.

361
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,570
Falling over each
other like in a BL series.

362
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,590
My rotten thing.

363
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,870
You are the cutest.

364
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,420
Tin, no.

365
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,520
You must be strong.

366
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,600
Come here.

367
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,540
I said you shouldn't sleep on high pillows.

368
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,000
Are you really drunk?

369
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,140
It's a good height.

370
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,150
Park.

371
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,540
If you are kind like this,

372
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,970
let's get married.

373
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,470
You're not really drunk.

374
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,060
Can I hug rotten things just for one night?

375
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,350
Okay.

376
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,320
My rotten thing are the cutest.

377
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,310
Park.

378
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,500
I really mean that.

379
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:42,590
If we get married, this rotten thing will sleep in your room every day.

380
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,080
Do you know the meaning of marriage?

381
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,320
Even I still don't know the meaning of marriage.

382
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:10,760
I don't understand how humans have to love each other

383
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,850
to be able to get married.

384
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,880
You still can't forget Palmthip, right?

385
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,200
You bought a new fish to replace the old one

386
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,910
because you still can't forget Palmthip, right?

387
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,300
Park.

388
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,420
Does it look too clean?

389
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,370
What are you doing, Tin?

390
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,300
Why are you stepping
on your own feet?

391
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,520
Do you want to feel pain?

392
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,160
Do you need my help?

393
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,780
Hey!

394
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,060
I'll drive you to university today.

395
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,590
Huh?

396
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,020
Is something up with my hearing?

397
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,830
Did you reconcile with me
because you were drunk last night?

398
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,660
Yeah.

399
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,080
Will you go with me?

400
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:25,210
If you go, ride with me.

401
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,260
Focus on studying too.

402
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:56,430
Yeah.

403
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:57,960
Ride safe.

404
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,460
Yeah.

405
00:26:59,180 --> 00:26:59,760
I'll go now.

406
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,620
Bye bye.

407
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,140
I don't want to study anymore.

408
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,970
I want to quit.

409
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,760
Hey, calm down.

410
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,830
Are you crazy?

411
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,230
Yes.

412
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,750
Or am I not suitable for art?

413
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,320
But you study because
you like it, isn't it?

414
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,180
Yes.

415
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:36,490
Are you going to give up easily like this?

416
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,370
I liked it at first,

417
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:46,540
but I wanted to run away after studying it.

418
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,650
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

419
00:27:50,887 --> 00:27:53,657
The teacher scolded me in the last work.

420
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,640
They scolded me so
much that I want to give up.

421
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,520
Hey, Tin.

422
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:01,030
Please use their scolding as a driving force.

423
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,540
It's a scolding, isn't it?

424
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,940
What happened to teachers these days?

425
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,380
They should encourage if they want to push us.

426
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,330
Yes.

427
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,040
You're right.

428
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,770
What should I do with my life?

429
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,800
Stop it.

430
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,050
Why do you have to stomp your feet?

431
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:22,940
Stop it.

432
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,220
Ewww. Bird poop.

433
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,630
Where?

434
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,340
Where?

435
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,070
Not you.

436
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:35,910
But...

437
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,430
Ewwww.

438
00:28:45,813 --> 00:28:46,923
Ewww.

439
00:28:47,978 --> 00:28:50,478
Why is my life so miserable???

440
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,500
Evil bird!

441
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,760
Keep an eye on it.

442
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,440
I'll tell Park.

443
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,740
Tin.

444
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,740
What happened to you, Tin?

445
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,100
Oh...

446
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,670
Bird poop on my head.

447
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,440
I'll take it out for you.

448
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:20,650
It's okay.

449
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:42,210
Watch out.

450
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,660
You made me laugh after so many days.

451
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,310
You laugh at my nemesis?

452
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:01,050
Your misfortune still has good luck.

453
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,330
What is it?

454
00:30:07,312 --> 00:30:08,532
That you met me.

455
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,080
Oh? Tin.

456
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,370
You are right here.
I've been looking for you in many places.

457
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,380
Where have you guys gone?

458
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,670
We bought tissues for you.

459
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,140
But it would be useless.

460
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,720
Because Plearn had already wiped it off for him.

461
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,670
How do you know my name?

462
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,850
I know Tiw.

463
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:40,710
Your friends.

464
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:41,780
Oh...

465
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:44,440
Tiw is very tricky.

466
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:48,250
He didn't introduce
me to juniors who are...

467
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,660
as cute as

468
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,700
you guys.

469
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,580
My hair is probably dry.

470
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,040
Thank you again, Plearn.

471
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:09,290
Hold on.

472
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,500
If next time we meet by chance again,

473
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,560
I'll think it's our destiny.

474
00:31:20,052 --> 00:31:21,622
Calm down.

475
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,630
Calm down.

476
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,840
Are you shy?

477
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,670
What is this?

478
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,940
Why did you drag me here?

479
00:31:36,073 --> 00:31:36,783
Are you shy?

480
00:31:37,068 --> 00:31:37,968
Who's shy?

481
00:31:37,993 --> 00:31:38,843
Hey.

482
00:31:38,868 --> 00:31:40,038
I know you're shy.

483
00:31:40,253 --> 00:31:40,633
Huh?

484
00:31:40,768 --> 00:31:43,998
It seems that someone isn't single anymore.

485
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:45,890
Yes.

486
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,890
I'm annoyed with him.

487
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,530
Park probably lost.

488
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,130
Right?

489
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,240
Yes.

490
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,470
No way.

491
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,570
Park is number one in my heart.

492
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:54,800
Hey~.

493
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,690
That "destiny". How do you know him?

494
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:01,670
Tell us.

495
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,340
It's a long story. I'll
tell you guys later.

496
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:04,650
Are you shy?

497
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,940
You never tell your friends when
you have good things happening.

498
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,880
It's really just a coincidence.

499
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,890
I am stressed.

500
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,000
Shall we go eat crepes?

501
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:15,770
Okay.

502
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,140
Let's go.

503
00:32:18,442 --> 00:32:19,098
Let's go.

504
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,600
You're always hungry, Tin.

505
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,770
Order mine first.

506
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:34,220
Orange marmalade, sweet egg floss, crab sticks,
topped with sauce, mayonnaise, soft batter, whose is it?

507
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,090
Let me see.

508
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:35,710
Why?

509
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,560
Look at this.

510
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,560
It's randomly mixed.

511
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:40,990
Let me see.

512
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:45,680
He probably just mixes what he likes.

513
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,290
But is it delicious?

514
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:51,410
It's not food and dessert.

515
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,660
How can it be eaten?

516
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:53,750
Beware of diarrhea.

517
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:54,470
Yes.

518
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,080
Don't talk bad about my Park.

519
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:01,080
Hey, I think Plearn was heartbroken from the start.

520
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:01,640
Right?

521
00:33:02,097 --> 00:33:03,727
All of Tin's life is Park.

522
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,180
No matter what, the answer is Park.

523
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,560
Now he talks about Park again.

524
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:07,690
Right?

525
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:10,870
Look at him, he talks about Park
whether he breathes in or out.

526
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,200
He probably won't see us anymore.

527
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:14,730
Stop teasing me. Can
I please have a break?

528
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,400
Hurry up.

529
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,490
Write pizza with bananas.

530
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:17,470
I want chilli paste and shredded pork.

531
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,350
Today you ordered something strange.

532
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,190
Hey, kid.

533
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:27,990
You bought a lot of them.

534
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,670
This is for Baitong and Rin.

535
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:34,985
This is for Pafun and Pimdao.

536
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:35,290
Here.

537
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,110
It's yours, Kana.

538
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,230
Me?

539
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,920
I didn't mean to buy it for you.

540
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,930
The seller doesn't have any change.

541
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:54,770
So I bought it for 100 baht.

542
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,540
I will accept it wholeheartedly.

543
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,190
Up to you.

544
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,330
Where is Pao?

545
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:03,800
He might be sleeping in the room.

546
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,050
Why didn't he come out to meet us lately?

547
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:09,530
He said he was
preparing for a test.

548
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:10,870
I don't know either.

549
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:13,950
Then... I'll put Park's crepe over here.

550
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,030
Don't eat it, kids.

551
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:20,760
I'll give this one to Pao.

552
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:21,690
Okay.

553
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:25,980
He didn't mean to buy it for you, but why didn't he buy it for me?

554
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:29,580
Kana, I'd like two bags of ice.

555
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:30,830
I don't sell it!

556
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,480
What happened to you, Kana?

557
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,530
It's my business.

558
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,810
That's some way to talk to kids.

559
00:34:36,505 --> 00:34:38,325
You're too truthful, Rin.

560
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,305
I'll do it with the older people too.

561
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,560
You are on the kids' side too.

562
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,630
Are you provoking these kids?

563
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,790
My group only has them.

564
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:49,700
Look at your friends.

565
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:57,590
Hello, Uncle Tong.

566
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,960
Oh, Tin?

567
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:00,750
Has Pao come home yet?

568
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,560
Yes.

569
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,370
He's in the room.

570
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:03,430
You can meet him.

571
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,370
You can go upstairs.

572
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:05,950
I ask your permission.

573
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,750
Pao.

574
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,610
Come in.

575
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,590
Hey, wait...

576
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,010
It's too late.

577
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:19,880
Wow...

578
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,290
Is this a bedroom or a library?

579
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,620
It's normal for teachers.

580
00:35:28,346 --> 00:35:29,456
It's not a lot.

581
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,900
There were more books in the other teachers' rooms.

582
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,650
Why did you knock it like that?

583
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,260
It's about to crash.

584
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:41,780
I don't know why.

585
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:44,270
It frozen up many times.
Sometimes it turns off by itself.

586
00:35:45,662 --> 00:35:46,482
It turned off again.

587
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,620
Why don't you buy a new one?

588
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,700
My salary is not enough.

589
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,390
Paying car installments,
water bills, electricity bills,

590
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,570
it's not enough for anything else.

591
00:35:59,130 --> 00:35:59,630
Oh.

592
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,330
Do you have anything you want to tell me?

593
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,510
I bought you a crepe.

594
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:08,680
Thank you.

595
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,180
Wow.

596
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,250
It seems that I haven't
seen you for many days.

597
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,180
Why?

598
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,930
Are you angry with us?

599
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,050
Why do you ask that?

600
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:31,050
You've been avoiding us since that day.

601
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,610
You're uncomfortable, right?

602
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:35,590
Just...

603
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,460
a little bit.

604
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,970
I don't want to make anyone feel bad.

605
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:48,280
Actually, no one should be compared.

606
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,120
Gosh... Pao.

607
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:56,890
If you feel bad, why haven't
you spoken since that day?

608
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,670
I don't want it to get any worse.

609
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:05,010
They were pretty mad
at being compared to me.

610
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,220
Let's put it this way.

611
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,370
I will be better than you.

612
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,940
I will make you fall
from the first place in the municipality.

613
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:13,340
Keep an eye on me.

614
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:15,250
So...

615
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:16,980
I'll leave my hopes to you.

616
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:20,510
I want to be a normal person so bad.

617
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,490
Pao.

618
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:26,630
Don't be angry with Bie and Kana.

619
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,120
You crazy.

620
00:37:29,374 --> 00:37:30,440
Why should I be angry with them?

621
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:33,970
So shall we meet them together?

622
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,100
Oh.

623
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:38,850
Here.

624
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:40,930
What's this for?

625
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,610
It's a belief.

626
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,710
When Pao bought me some shoes.

627
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:51,420
They say that if someone buys shoes
for you, that person will walk away.

628
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,480
I don't want anyone to walk out of my life.

629
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,560
Where do you remember it from?

630
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,570
Please take it.

631
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:05,120
Please transfer to Pai 5 baht.

632
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,640
You're ridiculous.

633
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:28,230
He must have missed Aunt Pavini too.

634
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:56,250
Ouch!

635
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:59,250
What are you doing?

636
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:00,810
Did you have a
bad dream just now?

637
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:03,850
You had a bad dream.

638
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:04,770
Really?

639
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,070
Why do I feel hurt?

640
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,930
Did your arm bump into something when you were sleeping?

641
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,360
Are you sure?

642
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:11,890
Yes.

643
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,050
I bought you a crepe.

644
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:21,210
Why?

645
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:22,740
What is it?

646
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,200
A crepe.

647
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,530
It is'nt.

648
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,130
Hair band on your wrist.

649
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:32,730
You're right.

650
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,700
Why is it here?

651
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,690
Which woman is it?

652
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,600
Forget it.

653
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,080
Just eat it.

654
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:46,210
The crepe is dry by now.

655
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:47,610
It's okay.

656
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:48,720
I like this more.

657
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:51,990
You like this...

658
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,540
or this?
