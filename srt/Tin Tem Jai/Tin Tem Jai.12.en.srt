00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,300
(Tin Tem Jai)
(Episode 12)

2
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,680
You guys don't have back pain?

3
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,960
You guys have big bodies
but still cuddle together.

4
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,080
What are you cooking since morning?

5
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,840
I made minced pork
porridge for breakfast, Park.

6
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,400
Umm.

7
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,480
Isn't it easier if you buy it?

8
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,800
I want to make it for everyone.

9
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,800
So that everyone wakes
up to eat hot porridge.

10
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,240
Would you like to try it?

11
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,400
Be careful, it's hot.

12
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,400
How was it?

13
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,360
Is it delicious?

14
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,080
It's delicious.

15
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,560
Whatever you cook, it's all delicious.

16
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,920
Because Aunt Phawinee taught me well.

17
00:04:03,213 --> 00:04:06,733
So I know your favourite flavor.

18
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,960
It seems like you really
miss my mom, right?

19
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,280
Yes.

20
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,880
It smells good.

21
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,600
Me?

22
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,600
I probably meant the rice.

23
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,360
Bie.

24
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,800
Wake up.

25
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,640
It's morning.

26
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,360
I need five minutes.

27
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,480
So I'll get up first.

28
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,320
Feel free to do it.

29
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,680
Wow.

30
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,560
Why do you guys get up so early?

31
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,520
It's normal, Pai.

32
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,480
I feel guilty.

33
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,960
I woke up so late that
my guests had to prepare meals for me.

34
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,680
It's okay, Pai.

35
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,200
It's normal that I make breakfast for Park.

36
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,880
It has become my routine.

37
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,240
You are very diligent, Tin.

38
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,080
It's so appetizing.

39
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,960
Wow!

40
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,640
It smells good.

41
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,520
It all looked appetizing.

42
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,880
Thank you, Tin.

43
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,760
What is this meal?

44
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,080
Wow.

45
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,120
Wow.

46
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,520
You cooked it all, Tin?

47
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,720
Yes, I cooked it all.

48
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,720
It's so appetizing.

49
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,560
You mean the food?

50
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,840
Yes, the food.

51
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:21,800
Yeah.

52
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,280
If it's appetizing, eat a lot.

53
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,480
Hey!

54
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,000
What?

55
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,680
Crispy pork.

56
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
Why are you overreacting?

57
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
You're overreacting a lot.

58
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,960
Why are you in a hurry to eat, Bie?

59
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,600
There's a concert today.

60
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,800
I am excited.

61
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,160
I need a lot of time to prepare.

62
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,000
Why?

63
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,000
Huh?

64
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,840
You don't understand.

65
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,560
I'm too lazy to explain it.

66
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,280
It's a waste of my time.

67
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,640
It's better to shower and get dressed.

68
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,400
She goes to a concert...

69
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,080
She comes fast and goes fast.

70
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,560
What's wrong with her?

71
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,760
It's delicious.

72
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,320
I'm so full.

73
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,480
Thank you, Tin.

74
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,680
It's okay.

75
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,120
Thank you.

76
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,120
Bye bye.

77
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,440
You can put it in the sink after cleaning.

78
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,640
I'll wash the dishes myself.

79
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,280
It's okay, Pai.

80
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,640
I clean it anyway.

81
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,000
I'll wash the dishes myself.

82
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,680
Is that OK, Tin?

83
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,560
I don't want my guests to clean up for me.

84
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,200
It's okay.

85
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,960
I'll help Tin wash the dishes.

86
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,360
Okay.

87
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,720
So I'm going to take a shower first.

88
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,360
Yeah.

89
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,640
Please take care of the rest, Tin.

90
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,320
Sure, Pai.

91
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,080
Can you do it?

92
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,120
Please unpack it for me, babe.

93
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,360
I can't unpack it.

94
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,280
Here.

95
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,760
Park.

96
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,120
Do you want to say something else?

97
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,240
I just noticed

98
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,320
that you've grown a lot.

99
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,760
Sure.

100
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,880
I've grown enough that
you have become my boyfriend.

101
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,240
You're so cute when you smile.

102
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,560
Please smile more after this.

103
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,840
I like it.

104
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,960
And before you didn't like it?

105
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,440
You tend to look sleepy
and dizzy normally.

106
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,920
I can't be exhausted?

107
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,600
Huh?

108
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,600
I didn't insult you.

109
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,520
I'm just saying your smile is cute.

110
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,840
So after this, I'll smile often.

111
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
Yay!

112
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,640
Do you know why?

113
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,360
Why? Park.

114
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,600
Because you

115
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,000
are my light.

116
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,800
Jungler. Jungler.

117
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,200
Jungler. Go!

118
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,080
Go!

119
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,200
Heal! Heal!

120
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm dying. Heal!

121
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,960
- Kana.
- Top up!

122
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:34,119
You must take a shower
after Bie finishes taking a shower.

123
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,960
You first.

124
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,120
Top up.

125
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,000
It's you who should take a shower first.

126
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,640
You're slow. The others
have to wait for you to shower.

127
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,720
Kana!

128
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,600
Yeah.

129
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,720
Just a moment.

130
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,680
You can see that I'm playing a game.

131
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
You can take a shower first.

132
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,680
I'll finish the game
right after you shower.

133
00:10:58,373 --> 00:10:59,453
You have a lot of excuses.

134
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,000
Go take a shower.

135
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,080
Hey.

136
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,960
Kana. Go take a shower.

137
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,400
Others have to wait for you, Kana.

138
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,800
Don't think that I will fall on you.

139
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,480
Go take a shower now!

140
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,120
Hey!

141
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,080
Hey!

142
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,120
Other people will see us.

143
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,760
Don't think too much.

144
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
Nobody saw us.

145
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,040
Right?

146
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,480
Alright.

147
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,320
I'm going to have a shower.

148
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,400
Hey. Hold on.

149
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:53,840
Huh?

150
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,760
Or shall we take a shower together?

151
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,280
I'm okay with it.

152
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,720
I'll go first.

153
00:12:09,272 --> 00:12:10,432
Would you like to bring
your phone with you?

154
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,600
In case you want to play music.

155
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,360
Yes, please.

156
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,040
Why are you late?

157
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,760
I'm choosing a song.

158
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,480
Can you hurry up and choose?

159
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,840
Why?

160
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,880
Why did she take so long to get dressed?

161
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,600
Wow.

162
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,640
What?

163
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,240
Why are you so beautiful today?

164
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,360
Why don't you dress like this at home?

165
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:23,840
Yes.

166
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,720
I only prepare packages at home.

167
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,560
Why do you want me to dress up?

168
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,840
But it's normal that everyone wants to be
beautiful in the eyes of the person they like.

169
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,920
Great.

170
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,720
That's right.

171
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,560
Just fully dressed up without worrying
about how much the makeup cost.

172
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,680
Yes, Pai.

173
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,600
Are you guys ready?

174
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,200
Yes.

175
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
I'm ready.

176
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,920
Shall we go now?

177
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,360
Let's go.

178
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,080
Let's go. I want to get there quickly.

179
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,120
She really wanted to hurry there.

180
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,000
Yes.

181
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,560
You spent 3 hours getting dressed.

182
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,600
Bie looks very happy today.

183
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,520
Yeah.

184
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,760
I think so.

185
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,360
It was the first time I had
ever seen her so happy.

186
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,120
I'm glad she's happy and being herself.

187
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:23,080
I wanted Manop to see how happy
his daughter was doing what she liked.

188
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,080
Yes.

189
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,640
Park.

190
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,000
Huh?

191
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,240
I want to eat ice cream.

192
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,480
Let's eat.

193
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,440
Okay.

194
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,320
Go!

195
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,320
I'm excited.

196
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,760
Here, your ticket.

197
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,320
This is my ticket.

198
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,160
Mine is this ticket.

199
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,160
Oh? What about Pao?

200
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,200
Pao went to the restroom.
He will follow soon.

201
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,560
Oh, okay.

202
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,600
So let's go in first.

203
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,160
Let's go.

204
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,360
I'm excited.

205
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,840
What time does it start?

206
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,640
They didn't print it on the tickets.

207
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,240
It will start soon.

208
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,120
Is it about to begin?

209
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,200
It's almost over?

210
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,280
I mean start.

211
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,480
It's about to start.

212
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,080
Hey.

213
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,280
They're about to show up.

214
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,960
Did you guys have fun?

215
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,240
Yes.

216
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,800
She did a good performance, isn't she?

217
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,280
Yes.

218
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,440
She always comes to
my salon for hair styling.

219
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,960
Barbie, why are you excited?

220
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,160
Thank you very much for today, sis.

221
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,800
It's more than a fan meeting.

222
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,800
Right? Tin.

223
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,840
I believe you. You danced very hard.

224
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,480
Today was fun, wasn't it?

225
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,520
I am hungry.

226
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,640
It seems I'm overly excited today.

227
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,080
You danced a lot. How
can it not make you hungry?

228
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,680
Are you hungry already?

229
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,880
I have a recommended restaurant.

230
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,640
It's a restaurant near here.

231
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,440
Will you go?

232
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,000
Yes!

233
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,320
Yes.

234
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:47,880
Is it a buffet?

235
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,800
No.

236
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,760
Well, just go now.

237
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,040
Let's go.

238
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,040
Oh? What about Pao?

239
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,200
He hasn't come yet. He's having diarrhea.

240
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:56,760
Okay.

241
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,880
It's not delicious at all.

242
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,560
It's not like a restaurant
at my house, is it?

243
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,840
Yes.

244
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,200
It can't compete with
Uncle Tong's restaurant.

245
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,080
I miss Uncle Tong's food.

246
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,440
You will be back tomorrow.

247
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,600
I'll take you to that restaurant.

248
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,520
I will show my skills tomorrow.

249
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,440
I want to thank Pai a lot today.

250
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,080
I also want to thank you for
taking me around in Bangkok.

251
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,160
My pleasure.

252
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,000
I still don't want to go back.

253
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,680
I don't want to work.

254
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,680
It's not the last time.

255
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,520
We'll be back here soon.

256
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,880
You have me, right?

257
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,840
Yeah.

258
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,240
I still don't want to go back.

259
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,440
I still want to travel, Park.

260
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,480
Yeah.

261
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,280
I completely agree.

262
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,440
But I have limited holidays.

263
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,240
Why should you complain?

264
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,960
We can come here again next time.

265
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,360
This is what I feel
after the concert is over.

266
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,200
I was so full of happiness that
it overflowed from my mouth.

267
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,840
I can't even lie on my side.

268
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,760
When it's about to pour out of my ear...

269
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,600
Get in the car!

270
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,440
Let's go.

271
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,880
Her mind was already
turned to sludge.

272
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,880
Why don't you go home
with your concert outfits?

273
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,320
Well, let's get in the car.

274
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,320
Let's go.

275
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,320
Your happiness flows from your ears
and it will stain the car.

276
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,880
Here they are!

277
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,400
There you are honey.

278
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,160
Hello everyone.

279
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,800
Did you guys eat anything yet?

280
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,480
Not yet.

281
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,320
So did you eat anything yet?

282
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,160
Not yet mum

283
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,560
we woke up early morning
and prepare ourselves.

284
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,080
Oh I see

285
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,960
you guys must be hungry.

286
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,760
If you guys didn't eat anything yet,
just order and I will cook for you

287
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,200
Me and Tin would like the
dishes that we normally get.

288
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:04,920
Okay

289
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,920
We want the same!

290
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,400
That's brilliant so I can cook at once.

291
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,400
How is everything going?

292
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,560
Mum!

293
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,920
We bought something for you.

294
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,760
Thanks.

295
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,720
Thank you very much.

296
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,360
Let's have a look.

297
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,760
I'm sure this one is mine.

298
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,000
Pink colour!

299
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,160
This one is for papa.

300
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,600
What colour is it?

301
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,760
It's yellow

302
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,960
Promise me, you will use it.

303
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,720
Of course!

304
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,440
You bought it for me I will use it.

305
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,080
I like it

306
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,560
How was the trip?

307
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,800
We had a great time and it's fun

308
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,720
Pai's house is so big,

309
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,600
and there's a lot of
space around her condo.

310
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,480
Pai is so successful people, Auntie.

311
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,000
The beds are so comfy.

312
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,080
Such good memories.

313
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,880
Pai!

314
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:13,240
Why did you never tell us
about your success in Bangkok?

315
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,480
Well, I just want you to
accept me as who I am.

316
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,000
I do not want you to accept me
because I succeeded in my career,

317
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,120
so I decided not to tell you.

318
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,000
I think we should go home,

319
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I need to unpack my things.

320
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,680
Let's go shall we?

321
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,520
I'm leaving

322
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,840
See you later.

323
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,480
That was fast! I am leaving, see you later.

324
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,160
Park.

325
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,600
Huh?

326
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,880
Would you like some orange juice?

327
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,120
I'll pick it up and pour it for you.

328
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,680
It's okay.

329
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,920
You can store your luggage first.

330
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,040
Really?

331
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,640
You don't drink it?

332
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,120
Yes.

333
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,440
Please keep my luggage.

334
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,880
Hurry up.

335
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:28,960
Go up.

336
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,000
Are you guys ready?

337
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,520
Yes.

338
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,320
Please standby,

339
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,040
before he sees us.

340
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,400
Hurry up.

341
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,960
Park!

342
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:42,720
Huh?

343
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,320
What do you want to do?

344
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:46,960
Uh...

345
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,840
Please close your eyes.

346
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,360
What?

347
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,800
Are you going to tease me?

348
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,320
Just close your eyes first.
I have something for you.

349
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,800
Please close your eyes.

350
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,440
Let's go.

351
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,240
Walk slowly.

352
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,280
You're not teasing me, are you?

353
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,760
I'm not teasing you.

354
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,280
Ready?

355
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:11,800
Huh?

356
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,680
One.

357
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,360
Two.

358
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,160
Three!

359
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,160
Surprise!

360
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,040
Wow.

361
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,000
How was it?

362
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,720
I like it.

363
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,080
It's very beautiful.

364
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,280
Park.

365
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,480
When did you do it?

366
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,000
It's still the same
before going to Bangkok.

367
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,520
I asked the gardener at
the hospital to decorate it.

368
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,080
During our trip to Bangkok.

369
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,680
How did he get into our house?

370
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,080
Passorn helped me.

371
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,840
Uncle!

372
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,680
Uncle!

373
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,240
Hi, boy?

374
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,240
I need some help from you.

375
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,240
What do you want me to help with?

376
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,000
I will renovate my garden at home.

377
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,320
Can you help me?

378
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,280
I don't have a problem with
money. You can tell me the cost.

379
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,720
I think we should talk over there.

380
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,440
Okay.

381
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,280
Hi, Passorn.

382
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,640
Hi, Park.

383
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,400
Do you have time now?

384
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,280
Yes, I'm just dealing with my
kids. Do you need any help?

385
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,800
I want to decorate my backyard.

386
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,880
During the 2-3 days that I went to Bangkok.

387
00:25:24,095 --> 00:25:24,575
Hmm?

388
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,240
Are you going to renovate your garden?
What are you thinking?

389
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,440
I just want to move on from my mother.

390
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,200
So I thought maybe some changes would help.

391
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,920
Do you need to do this?

392
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,120
Actually, I also want to surprise Tin.

393
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,120
He seems to really like the backyard.

394
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,480
So I want to decorate
it to make it colorful.

395
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,840
It's beautiful.

396
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,640
The garden is full of trees.

397
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,800
Do you like it?

398
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,680
Yes.

399
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,280
Mom will always be in our hearts.

400
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:08,880
Umm.

401
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:16,800
After this, this house will not be
just Aunt Phawinee's house.

402
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,800
Not my home.

403
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,240
But it's our home.

404
00:26:26,893 --> 00:26:28,293
It's our home too, Park.

405
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,440
Yes.

406
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,000
Yes.

407
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,560
I love you, Park.

408
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,600
I love you too.

409
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,560
Bravo!

410
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,240
Bravo!
