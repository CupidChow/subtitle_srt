00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,800
(Tin Tem Jai)
(Episode 5)

2
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:35,810
Tin,

3
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,240
do you take Park to be your life partner?

4
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:40,930
Yes.

5
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,620
Park, do you take Tin to be your life partner?

6
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,390
Yes.

7
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,060
Can you show your love to everyone?

8
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,330
Kiss now! Kiss now! Kiss now!

9
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,230
Kiss now!

10
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,220
Tin.

11
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,580
Tin.

12
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,390
Tin!

13
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,500
Huh?

14
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,960
The reason you're smiling is that

15
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,420
is because you're thinking
of something awful, right?

16
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,980
I'm not.

17
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:19,780
That's it.

18
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,350
I'm really right.

19
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,820
You're so cute when you eat something.

20
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:33,950
I can see your cuteness
forever if we get married.

21
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,260
Just get married to a dog.

22
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,400
Why?

23
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,310
Did I take care of you so poorly?

24
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,060
But I'm almost everything to you.

25
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,060
Why don't you accept my love?

26
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,520
Please?

27
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,410
We have a brotherly relationship, don't we?

28
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,170
How can siblings get married?

29
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:38,680
♫ I forget that we don't love each other
even though you walk away from me ♫

30
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:45,560
♫ If it bothers you, I'm sorry
for still worrying about you ♫

31
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,050
♫ My heart only has you ♫

32
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,020
What's wrong with you?

33
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,940
Why?

34
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,110
Do you have appendicitis pain?

35
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,130
I'm just into heartbreaking songs.

36
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,380
What does it mean
that you're heartbroken?

37
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,890
You don't even have a lover.

38
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:11,330
Someone always break our hearts even
if we don't have a lover.

39
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,770
My someone is you.

40
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,970
What do you mean?

41
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,080
You're delirious.

42
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,690
Park...

43
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,530
When will your work be finished?

44
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,420
I'm not in a hurry.

45
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,320
I just keep working on it.

46
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,740
You draw once and sing for 5 minutes?

47
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,380
Will it be finished in this life?

48
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,070
It's my business.

49
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,220
Get out of here.

50
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,690
I can't concentrate.

51
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,090
Hey, how are you?

52
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,330
Would you like some oranges?

53
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:01,810
Huh?

54
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,530
I don't eat...

55
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:16,740
Park.

56
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,040
You still miss Palm, don't you?

57
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:24,110
Why should I miss someone
who already has a boyfriend?

58
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,140
She's married.

59
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:34,370
But the other girlfriend was your ex.

60
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,160
Sometimes I feel like
you still can't forget Palm.

61
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,370
You just imagining it.

62
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,210
Isn't it true?

63
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,900
This is proof.

64
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,450
Romeo in this jar.

65
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,230
What does it have
to do with my son?

66
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,930
Wasn't Romeo the first
goldfish Palm bought you?

67
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,620
I bought it myself.

68
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,780
How is it possible?

69
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,010
You've said before that...

70
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,860
Mom didn't allow me to
raise him back then.

71
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,470
Our house is a restaurant.
Animals can't be raised there.

72
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,080
So I said someone else bought it for me
so she wouldn't complain to me.

73
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,490
My mom always loved others more than me.

74
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,210
I've misunderstood you for years?

75
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,400
Yes.

76
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,130
You buy a new goldfish and give it an old name,

77
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,840
does it mean that you really can't accept it's death?

78
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,730
I've already told you.

79
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,474
What about when you met Palm that day

80
00:07:31,794 --> 00:07:35,040
and you called your name like
you did when you dated her?

81
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,240
I couldn't think of anything back then.

82
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,360
So I don't know how I should call myself.

83
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,610
I misunderstood you.

84
00:07:49,977 --> 00:07:51,307
What do you mean?

85
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,400
I think you still love Palm.

86
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:01,930
I'm ♫ frightened. It disappeared into the air ♫

87
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,370
You're ridiculous.

88
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,100
Park.

89
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,770
Let's get married.

90
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,250
That's more absurd.

91
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,470
I love you so much

92
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,140
but you don't love me at all?

93
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,020
I'm going to bed now.

94
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,170
Park!

95
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:43,880
Huh?

96
00:08:44,378 --> 00:08:47,378
Can't you tell me that you
love me before going to bed?

97
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,610
Tell me you love me first, please?

98
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,690
Ouch!

99
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,780
Just hurry up and finish it and go to bed.

100
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,760
Don't go to bed late.

101
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,370
Yes, yes, yes. I know.

102
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,840
Who wants to be
siblings with you?

103
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,180
I don't give up easily.

104
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:16,940
Keep an eye out, Park.

105
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,050
Park!

106
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:21,970
Park!

107
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,300
Help me, Park!

108
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,850
Hey!

109
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,100
Wait...

110
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,370
What happened?

111
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,290
There are cockroaches in my room.

112
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,450
I think it's a big deal.

113
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,270
I'm scared.

114
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,220
It's as big as this.

115
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:46,890
Then it flew over my face.

116
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,920
Can I sleep with you tonight?

117
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,010
No!

118
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,240
I don't want to sleep with cockroaches.

119
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,190
Then

120
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,540
you must kill it for me.

121
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,190
You...

122
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,660
You grow up like a
buffalo, but you still...

123
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,810
There was only one cockroach.

124
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:22,050
If it's a whole family of
cockroaches, what should I do?

125
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:26,490
It will walk all over my room.

126
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,510
You haven't stopped yet?

127
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,330
I'm afraid of it.

128
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,320
Alright.

129
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,180
Just sleep with me.

130
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,290
Don't touch me.

131
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,530
I get it.

132
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:49,540
Stop holding me.

133
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,290
I'll sleep here.

134
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,950
Up to you.

135
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:57,770
Oh?

136
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,190
My pillow is so high.

137
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,150
Sleeping on high pillows is bad, right?

138
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:25,440
Is there something for me
to sleep on instead of a pillow?

139
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,550
My feet?

140
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,920
The height is just right.

141
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,720
Park...

142
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,640
Isn't it good enough that
I let you sleep with me?

143
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,260
Stop seducing me.

144
00:11:59,250 --> 00:11:59,970
Hey.

145
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,840
Hey.

146
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,060
Just sleep, you rotten thing.

147
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,270
I've killed it.

148
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,700
Just throw it in the trash.

149
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:01,710
Tonight, don't bother asking me
to sleep in my room again.

150
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,090
I don't understand
why you're afraid of it.

151
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,880
Why are you holding it?

152
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,270
Throw it!

153
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,090
Yeah.

154
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,580
Park, hurry up. I'm going to be late.

155
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,940
Have I ever made you late?

156
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,620
Yes!

157
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,620
Alright. Just a little more.

158
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,810
Park! Be careful, it's
stuck in your throat!

159
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:29,950
Here.

160
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,130
Park.

161
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,060
Wow...

162
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,130
Let's go.

163
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,330
Wow.

164
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,610
He really was in a hurry.

165
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,370
Don't come home late.

166
00:13:56,132 --> 00:13:57,442
I know.

167
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,150
You're still arguing with me.

168
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,130
You don't even carry an umbrella.

169
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,720
It rains a lot these days.

170
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,430
Why don't you rush to work?

171
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,620
Otherwise you will be late.

172
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,020
Yeah.

173
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:08,810
I'll go now.

174
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,190
Bye bye.

175
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:10,780
Yeah.

176
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,680
I'm going to study now.

177
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,230
[Sam Khok Hospital]

178
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:21,752
Hello, Pimdao.

179
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,860
Hello, Park.

180
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,110
You're here, Park?

181
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,420
I may not have arrived yet.

182
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,470
I'm just asking you

183
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,010
as a courtesy.

184
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,440
Just kidding.

185
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,870
You haven't gone to school yet, Pimdao?

186
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,920
I'm waiting for my father to pick me up.

187
00:14:41,788 --> 00:14:42,878
Let me see.

188
00:14:43,435 --> 00:14:44,245
What are you drawing?

189
00:14:50,975 --> 00:14:51,775
Tin.

190
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,560
What?

191
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,560
Please go buy snacks with me.

192
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,370
I'm busy.

193
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:56,755
Just ask your girlfriend.

194
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,950
No, you're the only one who doesn't mess up.

195
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,160
Donut had to waste time washing her hands.

196
00:15:01,506 --> 00:15:02,186
Please go with me.

197
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,260
Okay.

198
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,560
Your change is 10 baht.

199
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,650
Thank you.

200
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:17,610
What do you want?

201
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,880
Auntie. 1 bottle of soda, please.

202
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,140
Cola?

203
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,390
Okay.

204
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,280
Here.

205
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,520
Here.

206
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,580
Thank you.

207
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,100
He's going to pay.

208
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,530
Hey.

209
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,850
Name!

210
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,380
Tin.

211
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:57,049
You're cute, Tin.

212
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:58,680
Huh?

213
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,450
We meet again.

214
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,420
It's really a coincidence.

215
00:16:06,075 --> 00:16:07,145
I deliberately do it.

216
00:16:09,746 --> 00:16:11,866
Do you have classes or...

217
00:16:12,273 --> 00:16:12,853
Oh...

218
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,190
I'm doing an exhibition with my friends.

219
00:16:16,835 --> 00:16:18,915
Do you need my help?

220
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,780
Uh... yes?

221
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,900
I have some free time.

222
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,280
My friends are free as well.

223
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:34,519
But what major do you study?

224
00:16:35,263 --> 00:16:36,543
I study Thai art.

225
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,160
That's cool.

226
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,250
Would you like to
study this major?

227
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,550
No.

228
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,230
You are not good at it?

229
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,940
My brain can't take it.

230
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,880
You both dislike it
and aren't good at it?

231
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,030
Absolutely.

232
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,670
I don't even want to live
when I think about my next project.

233
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,410
I can help you.

234
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,180
Can I accept?

235
00:17:08,606 --> 00:17:09,635
You are a final year student.

236
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,370
Do you have free time?

237
00:17:11,807 --> 00:17:15,257
If it's you, I can give you some time...

238
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,220
a little.

239
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,300
Isn't it weird?

240
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,100
This.

241
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,580
I think it's more like a mini heart.

242
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,360
Uh.

243
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,100
Can I have your contact info?

244
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,540
Just in case.

245
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,410
Please?

246
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,040
Sure.

247
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,300
Thank you.

248
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,100
Where is the cut-out sheet?

249
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,690
It's in the storage room.

250
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,770
I haven't brought it yet.

251
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,820
I told you to bring it earlier,
why didn't you bring it?

252
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,790
I'll go get it.

253
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:13,650
Hey.

254
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,780
It's heavy. You can't carry it.

255
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,120
- I'll go get it myself.
- It's okay.

256
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:16,890
Let's go together.

257
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,650
Let's go.

258
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,130
What is it?

259
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:30,480
It looks like my ankle is sprained.

260
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,090
Name.

261
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,310
You take Donut to sit there and rest.

262
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:35,020
- Okay.

263
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,090
I'll go get it myself.

264
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,920
I'll help you.

265
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:41,690
Okay.

266
00:18:46,721 --> 00:18:48,721
Compress it first.

267
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,300
At least it's still cool.

268
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,160
Thank you.

269
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,890
Remember it.

270
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,580
I will never let you get hurt.

271
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,030
Which one?

272
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,090
Hey!!

273
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,020
Are you okay, Tin?

274
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,860
I'm okay.

275
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,670
You're not hurt, are you?

276
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,400
Yes.

277
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,890
What happened to you?

278
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,030
There's a cockroach in there.

279
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,460
Are you afraid of cockroaches?

280
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,340
I hate it.

281
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,250
Just put more work in, it's done.

282
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:06,680
Hey.

283
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,970
The three of you can go back first.

284
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,500
Me and Donut are going to buy abrasive paper.

285
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,420
Bye bye.

286
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,480
I'll wash your shirt, Tin.

287
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,120
Hey. It's okay.

288
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,460
Take it off. I'll wash it myself.

289
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,340
What happened to you, Tin? Your body is all red.

290
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,440
What happened to you, Tin?

291
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,730
I'm just itchy.

292
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,870
How can you say you're okay?

293
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,340
Your neck is all red.

294
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:40,780
I'm sorry.

295
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,310
It's okay.

296
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,580
It will be better.

297
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,620
Are you really okay?

298
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,420
Yes.

299
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:50,650
I'm okay.

300
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,420
Let's get back.

301
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:58,580
I have to go now, Plearn.

302
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,180
Thanks for helping me today.

303
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,070
Let's get back.

304
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,630
Wait, Tin.

305
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,180
Do you want me to take you to your house?

306
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,510
It's okay.

307
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,000
My house is not far from here.

308
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,560
Then, get back home safely.

309
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,140
Hey, Plearn.

310
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,560
Why are you only asking Tin?

311
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,740
Hey, isn't your house next to the college?

312
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,930
You can walk there.

313
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,390
It looks like you're flirting with Tin.

314
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,420
Hey, hey, hey.

315
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,390
Or are you really going to flirt with Tin?

316
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,180
If I like him, I have to flirt with him.

317
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,400
If I don't do something,

318
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:47,890
will he love me?

319
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,220
Hey!!

320
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,090
Hey, hey.

321
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,760
Hey.

322
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,150
Go. Go.

323
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,390
Go.

324
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,680
Just go.

325
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,870
Go.

326
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,020
Go.

327
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,160
Are you shy?

328
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,320
Why is my heart racing?

329
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:37,962
Pao!

330
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,860
Oh? Hi.

331
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,610
Please say you
want to flirt with me.

332
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,030
Huh?

333
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,360
Just say it, I know it's not true.

334
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,750
Please say you want to flirt with me.

335
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,980
Are you rehearsing for a stage play?

336
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:52,670
Yeah.

337
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,960
It's a big event.

338
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,450
Get out of here.

339
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,390
Park will scold you if you keep playing nonsense.

340
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,580
Hey, Pao.

341
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,490
Just do your homework.

342
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,240
I don't have any.

343
00:23:22,742 --> 00:23:24,072
If you don't have one, just go take a shower.

344
00:23:24,524 --> 00:23:25,354
I know.

345
00:23:30,699 --> 00:23:31,959
You didn't even help me.

346
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,210
Tin!

347
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:46,650
You've come here again.

348
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,920
Your mom came to see me.

349
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,620
She said she wanted me to
take care of Manow for 2-3 hours.

350
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:56,610
Oh.

351
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,010
It's hard for me and
you again, isn't it?

352
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,460
She said she was going to pick up Manow
after everything was done.

353
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,940
So I would like to ask you to take care of her first.

354
00:24:05,081 --> 00:24:06,271
I have to rush back to the store.

355
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:07,800
Okay.

356
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,010
Manow, please stay with Tin first.

357
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,470
Okay.

358
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,080
Bye.

359
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:13,980
Yeah.

360
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,150
Bye bye.

361
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:15,930
Bye bye.

362
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:16,670
Bye bye.

363
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,410
Level 2.

364
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,180
Level...

365
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,080
3.

366
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,260
3.

367
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,470
Manow!

368
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,620
Mom has come to pick you up.

369
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,770
Let's go see your mom.

370
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:34,860
Yay!

371
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:35,440
Let's go.

372
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,080
I'll go now.

373
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,310
Please take care of her.

374
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:39,810
Okay.

375
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,490
Manow, say goodbye to Tin.

376
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,270
Bye, Tin.

377
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,120
Bye.

378
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:45,190
I'll go now.

379
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,250
Let's go!

380
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,520
Mom is waiting for you.

381
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:48,830
Let's go home.

382
00:24:56,772 --> 00:25:00,562
Mom, have you ever thought
of taking me back like this?

383
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,070
Kana.

384
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:18,780
Kana!

385
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,710
Why are you so absent-minded?

386
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,320
Are you addicted to drugs again?

387
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:24,700
Are you crazy?

388
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,850
What are you thinking about?

389
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:29,380
I miss my girlfriend.

390
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,110
Huh?

391
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,770
When did you have a girlfriend?

392
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,090
I thought...

393
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:37,840
I'd get a girlfriend...

394
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:38,810
When?

395
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,810
You're ridiculous.

396
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:41,320
Oh.

397
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:42,910
Why haven't you gone home yet?

398
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,170
I forgot my house key.

399
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,980
You keep spending time flirting with Park,

400
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,930
so you're forgetful.

401
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,930
Just do less of it.

402
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:56,970
You're so hedonistic.

403
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,480
Kana, you...

404
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,560
You run after a man.

405
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,780
It's my happiness. So what?

406
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:03,050
Kana, I want some ice cream.

407
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,060
Just pick it up.

408
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,870
She wants to eat it, why would she tell me?

409
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,620
Kana, how much?

410
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:13,880
15 bath.

411
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:21,440
I'll give you your change later.

412
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,640
I see you eat it often.

413
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,600
Is it tasty?

414
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,520
Yes, have you never tried it?

415
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,260
Yes.

416
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,840
Aunt Mam won't allow
you to eat ice cream.

417
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:36,212
Because your actions are not cute.

418
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:37,320
Hey.

419
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,780
What right do you have
to say that I'm stubborn?

420
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:39,550
Get out!

421
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,140
Get out of here.

422
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:42,430
These kids...

423
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,590
Would you like some ice cream?

424
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,750
Where did Uncle Kai and Aunt Mam go?

425
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,240
My mother went to grandma's house.

426
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,290
My father might go to the casino.

427
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,180
They must have argued when they returned.

428
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,040
Late night. You can
keep an eye out for it.

429
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,050
Uncle Kai is a very kind person.

430
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,740
Everyone is kind to you.

431
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,560
Because I look pitiful?

432
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,400
Huh?

433
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,600
Because I don't have parents.

434
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,010
Because I was abandoned.

435
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,960
So everyone pities me?

436
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,040
What do you mean?

437
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,400
It's a waste of time to
pity a naughty kid like you.

438
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,350
Taking pity on people like
you, pitying dogs is better.

439
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,580
Just stay quiet.

440
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,330
Who said you were dumped?

441
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,240
Isn't your mother still sending you money?

442
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,160
Yeah.

443
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:56,460
Even though my mother is close by,
she hasn't come to see me.

444
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,120
Don't you want to go see your mother?

445
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,350
No.

446
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:04,960
Why?

447
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:09,850
If she wants to see me,
she will come to me herself.

448
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:10,460
That's it.

449
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,520
It's okay even if you're really dumped.

450
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:17,520
You still have us.

451
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,350
I mean,

452
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,180
Just having Park is
more than enough for you.

453
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:29,510
Having us is good because
there are many people.

454
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,940
No one is left behind
in the crispy pork gang.

455
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,490
You can say nice things too.

456
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,470
You keep bothering me.

457
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,710
I'm really sincere.

458
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,910
Your sincerity is the problem.

459
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,280
You can't be sincere without manners.

460
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,070
It's like you didn't grow up with manners.

461
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,580
So you don't know if it's necessary.

462
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,910
Words can hurt people.

463
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,580
Are you scolding me?

464
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,150
Of course.

465
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,150
You even let a kid like me teach you.

466
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,090
You just got home?

467
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,690
I've been home for a long time.

468
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,200
But I forgot my house key.

469
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,910
So I couldn't get in.

470
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,480
So I'm waiting for you here.

471
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,080
Oh.

472
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:47,570
This is my colleague,
I invited her to have dinner together.

473
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,910
Are you Tin, right?

474
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,320
Park talks about you a lot.

475
00:29:52,345 --> 00:29:53,535
I thought you would be younger.

476
00:29:53,754 --> 00:29:54,834
But you've grown up.

477
00:29:55,671 --> 00:29:57,431
When did I say he was young?

478
00:29:58,562 --> 00:30:02,162
No, when you talk about him, it's
like you talk about a 7-8 year old kid.

479
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,700
They have arrived.

480
00:30:06,981 --> 00:30:09,600
Where is the crispy pork rice
that you brag about often?

481
00:30:09,857 --> 00:30:10,727
What am I bragging about?

482
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,540
Just taste it. I'll let you
kick me if it isn't good.

483
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,270
Hey, I have to taste it.

484
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,370
He is...?

485
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:19,680
He is Tin.

486
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,670
Oh.

487
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,710
Is he the younger brother
you always talk about?

488
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,250
Yeah.

489
00:30:22,275 --> 00:30:23,465
Is he really this old?

490
00:30:23,911 --> 00:30:25,071
He has a cute face.

491
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,580
He's good-looking like his older brother.

492
00:30:28,475 --> 00:30:30,285
I'm going to eat.

493
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,200
Will you go with us?

494
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,480
It's okay.

495
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:33,990
I'm not hungry right now.

496
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,720
You guys can eat together.

497
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:36,770
Okay.

498
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:38,115
Then we'll go first.

499
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,280
Yeah.

500
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:40,580
Let's go.

501
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:41,190
Let's go.

502
00:30:41,431 --> 00:30:43,561
Hey, aren't you really coming with us?

503
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,740
It's okay.

504
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,580
Please enjoy it.

505
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,960
Okay, see you later.

506
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,300
Bye bye.

507
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,260
Enjoy it.

508
00:30:56,782 --> 00:30:59,932
How is Park close to her?

509
00:31:01,358 --> 00:31:02,188
Hey!

510
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,600
Are you shocked?

511
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:05,520
I'm sorry.

512
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:08,480
Because you never knocked on my door.

513
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,300
I've never knocked on it,

514
00:31:10,754 --> 00:31:12,054
so I don't know if I have to knock on it.

515
00:31:12,903 --> 00:31:15,000
Do you know what privacy is?

516
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,550
I only know emergency.

517
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,670
So why aren't you wearing clothes?

518
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,550
Or... do you think
something is bad for me?

519
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,920
You bastard.

520
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,320
I just came to borrow the battery charger.

521
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,550
Gosh...

522
00:31:31,317 --> 00:31:33,367
Since you took off your shirt,

523
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,380
you can't make love with me first?

524
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:39,800
If you don't try to do something that makes
me want to kick you, will it kill you?

525
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,130
What happened to you?

526
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,760
I'm your boyfriend.

527
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,690
Tin.

528
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,640
You haven't stopped joking.

529
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,670
You're really...

530
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,780
I just feel itchy.

531
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,610
I think it's because of the dust.

532
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,310
I help my friend carry things.

533
00:32:22,146 --> 00:32:23,346
Are you really okay?

534
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:24,610
Is it swollen?

535
00:32:24,837 --> 00:32:25,997
You're just itchy, right?

536
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:27,059
Yeah.

537
00:32:27,431 --> 00:32:29,421
Are your eyes swollen?

538
00:32:29,461 --> 00:32:30,131
Let me see.

539
00:32:30,768 --> 00:32:31,228
Huh?

540
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,270
Having trouble breathing?

541
00:32:34,906 --> 00:32:36,400
Is your tongue and throat swollen?

542
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,210
Open your mouth.

543
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,000
Park!

544
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,480
I'm okay.

545
00:32:42,171 --> 00:32:44,791
Did you have any symptoms before?

546
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:46,610
Is your breathing consistent?

547
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,140
Is your heart fluttering or pounding?

548
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:53,800
For now, it's like that.

549
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,570
Your heart flutters?

550
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:57,970
Yes.

551
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,790
I blush at you.

552
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:01,590
Tin.

553
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,290
Can you be serious for one minute?

554
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:05,180
I'm worried about you.

555
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:11,180
Don't joke about it.

556
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,520
I already told you that
nothing much happened to me.

557
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,950
It's not a big deal.

558
00:33:18,594 --> 00:33:21,864
You think you're not a big deal to me?

559
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,740
What should I do if
something happens to you?

560
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,100
If I let you die,

561
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,940
your father will never forgive me.

562
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:54,830
Park.

563
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,480
I'm sorry.

564
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,340
I'll tell you everything after this.

565
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:01,710
Yeah.

566
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,830
You answer me just only 'yeah'?

567
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:05,850
How do you want me to answer?

568
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,340
You must apologize to me

569
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,730
that you scolded me too much.

570
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:15,260
I'm sorry.

571
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,110
I'll be more calm after this.

572
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:24,230
You haven't eaten anything yet, have you?

573
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,200
Do you want something to eat?

574
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,240
Can you take me to a restaurant?

575
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,780
I want to eat shrimp dumplings.

576
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,870
But you have to dress nicely first.

577
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:46,990
Here.

578
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:48,730
I bought it for you.

579
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,940
I see that you are stressed lately.

580
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,720
Just in case it helps you.

581
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:56,830
Thank you.

582
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:13,110
How is it?

583
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:15,840
It's good.

584
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:17,580
Can you see?

585
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,860
I told you, alcohol can heal anything.

586
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:25,660
I think it's not because of the alcohol.

587
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,470
Then, why?

588
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,360
Hey.

589
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:56,750
Are you drunk?

590
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,520
I'm not drunk.

591
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:05,330
I think drinking makes me braver.

592
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:13,180
Don't do it again if you don't have feelings for me.

593
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,050
I'll order shrimp dumplings.

594
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:45,530
Okay.

595
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:46,380
A big one.

596
00:38:54,061 --> 00:38:54,860
You want dumplings, right?

597
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,550
Shrimp dumplings!

598
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:57,330
2 plates of shrimp dumplings, please.

599
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,130
Okay, please wait for a moment.

600
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:02,010
Park!

601
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:02,850
Huh?

602
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,230
Can I eat meatballs too?

603
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,360
Up to you.

604
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,030
Here.

605
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,570
What do you want?

606
00:39:23,937 --> 00:39:25,375
You can pick it up and put it on the tray.

607
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,010
This one.

608
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:27,130
This one.

609
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:27,810
Oh.

610
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,250
Oh, it's raining.

611
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,560
Come in here.

612
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,250
This one.

613
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,210
Please spread it, I will help you.

614
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,680
Come in, you're going to get wet.

615
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,260
It's okay, I'll unfold it myself.

616
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,330
I'll help you.

617
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:44,330
Come in, you're going to get wet.

618
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:46,830
Look at you, you're all wet.

619
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:49,730
It's okay. It's just a little bit.

620
00:39:50,649 --> 00:39:52,659
Wait until the rain stops and then you can go.

621
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,800
But my brother is waiting across here.

622
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,140
I must hurry back.

623
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,350
Thank you.

624
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:02,630
Can you go there?

625
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,380
Slowly cross the road, be careful it's slippery.

626
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,850
Park, look at this!

627
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,670
I got free meatballs.

628
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,940
I help her spread the tarp.

629
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:17,140
She was very kind.

630
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:18,550
Yeah.

631
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,330
You did well.

632
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,330
Here.

633
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,840
You're wet like a drowned puppy.

634
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,270
What do you mean, puppy?

635
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:29,910
Get it!

636
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:30,830
Tin!

637
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,860
It's wet!

638
00:40:54,788 --> 00:40:56,098
Just eat your meatballs.

639
00:40:57,092 --> 00:40:58,952
How does eating meatballs help?

640
00:41:00,396 --> 00:41:01,636
It can help you from being hungry.

641
00:41:02,774 --> 00:41:04,244
I told you I'm cold.

642
00:41:04,743 --> 00:41:05,823
What do you want me to do?

643
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,800
Take off your jacket and put it on me.

644
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:11,909
Like the protagonist
of a series.

645
00:41:12,312 --> 00:41:13,262
Cool scene.

646
00:41:13,598 --> 00:41:15,088
How can I take it off?

647
00:41:15,754 --> 00:41:17,194
I'm not wearing anything underneath.

648
00:41:17,667 --> 00:41:19,727
Why don't you wear an undershirt?

649
00:41:21,089 --> 00:41:22,899
I just grabbed what was in front of me.

650
00:41:24,011 --> 00:41:24,951
Who knows?

651
00:41:24,976 --> 00:41:26,136
I think we were just out for a moment.

652
00:41:27,263 --> 00:41:29,183
That's just like you.

653
00:41:36,622 --> 00:41:37,302
Why are you smiling?

654
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:41,046
What series have you watched?

655
00:41:41,071 --> 00:41:41,651
Huh?

656
00:41:42,654 --> 00:41:45,164
Every series does that.

657
00:41:45,611 --> 00:41:46,751
You don't know anything.

658
00:41:56,933 --> 00:41:59,573
If it were me, I wouldn't do that.

659
00:42:00,745 --> 00:42:02,695
You've never done anything like this anyway.

660
00:42:02,891 --> 00:42:04,061
You've never been romantic.

661
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:17,850
If it were me, I would do this.
