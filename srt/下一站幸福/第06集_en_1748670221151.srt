1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Next, I will broadcast for you

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Next time, happy

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I have no choice but to keep my hand on this person

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I can't do it

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I want to make people happy

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You will come to save me

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You really come

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I really can't do it

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm dying

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm brainwashed

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I don't think you are qualified to be with Guangxi

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But I won't give up on the chance to let Guangxi live

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Since you have such good willpower, why can't you accept the help of the contract?

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
First, it's Sheng Le Tang

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Now, it's my head

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I don't want to be with Lang Tian

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
As long as I'm with him, I will win this battle

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Guangxi, I'm sorry

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Sheng Le should say sorry

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Miss Liang, please help me

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm sorry

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Mr. Wen, please wait a moment

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I need to go to the doctor's office

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Thank you, Sheng Le

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
My back hurts

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's okay

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm sorry

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This boyfriend is really hard

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
If you are hurt, I will put you in the water

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And not on the bed

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If you don't go in, you will be in trouble

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I don't want to forget

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
how to believe in him

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Tomorrow is the future

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You see how special I am

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I should be the first one to hide in the bed with you

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
only with one hand

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I really don't want to

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
My heart hurts and I won't forget

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,720
We are no longer in the place where we belong

41
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:51,520
The first hall, the final hall

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Are you afraid?

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm afraid you'll be hurt, and you'll be fine

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The test looks painful

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But I can't share it with you

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Nor can I do anything for you

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What?

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
If you didn't accompany me,

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You would have been in pain

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I can't do this

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I just hope that this is the result of your efforts

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'll let you go

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I've been disappointed by you for a few days

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I don't want you to be disappointed by me

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Give me the beer

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Thanks

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Your boyfriend is a good guy

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He's so good at playing the game

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm sure you're very lucky

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Sorry, my boyfriend is talking nonsense

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He's got a brain tumor, so he can't control what he's doing

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
No, you can't say that

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm just saying what I really want to say

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And I can't lie

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's true

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Xiaodan, what do you want to say to me?

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I love you so much, Huixin

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Although you're a little unreasonable,

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You should be a bit more generous

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You're so annoying

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But I really have a brain tumor

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm sorry

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You two came out of the tumor

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Both of you look so sad

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He has to come over to fight

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You're right

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm so proud of you

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You know what?

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm the most embarrassed person in the world

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I look like I'm just a stranger to the world

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Please, it's the 21st century

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Technology is so advanced

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The efficiency of the natural cancer is getting higher

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Now, moving out of this

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The background of the 8th Hall is a bit suspicious

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You're right

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
When the tumor was broken last winter

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The doctor also suggested that it might not be over this year

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But it's over this year

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And under our medical care

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
His condition is getting better

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
In a few days

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
He will be doing the last operation

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
After the operation is over

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
We can go to the hospital

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The point is

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
After the operation

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We have to get a divorce

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Let's go get the seal

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Okay

101
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
If you want to

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You can come and have a drink

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You have to come

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And you have to take part in the wedding

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You will also kick the ball?

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yes

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
After the operation

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
We will kick the ball together

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Okay

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I haven't kicked the ball for a long time

111
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I haven't kicked the ball for a long time

112
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We are very close

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Next

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Go

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Don't move

116
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'll cut it

117
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You're afraid of the egg, right?

118
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm afraid if you die

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It will be so bad

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You're afraid that it will make you sad?

121
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You're afraid that if it doesn't take care of you

122
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It will leave you alone in this world

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
How lonely and lonely

124
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You're afraid that if you really die

125
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You will have many things

126
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But you can't finish them all

127
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm sorry

128
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Why?

129
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Why must I?

130
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I really want to be the second main character of Sanli

131
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And one day

132
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The doctor will tell me

133
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That the medicine is gone

134
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I can go back to the past

135
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You know what?

136
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
When I knew that I was brainwashed

137
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I told myself

138
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
This is a gift from my god

139
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
This flow

140
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Remains in my mind every day

141
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But breathing here

142
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Is precious

143
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
As long as I can talk to the doctor

144
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'll cherish him more

145
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Because of this disease

146
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It makes my life come back to life

147
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
This journey

148
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I shouldn't deny it

149
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Sometimes it's really painful

150
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Sometimes it's really sad

151
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But don't despair

152
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Don't give up

153
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Look

154
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Life is in our hands

155
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Who can control its length?

156
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So

157
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Don't worry

158
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Everything will be safe

159
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You know

160
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You forgot

161
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You're going to attend our wedding

162
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So sad

163
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm serious

164
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You know it too

165
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I just can't lie to you

166
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I want to go back to the past

167
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I can't do it

168
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's a dream

169
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I can't do it

170
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I can't do it

171
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I can't do it

172
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I can't do it

173
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I can't do it

174
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Mo Chen

175
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Mo Chen

176
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What's wrong?

177
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Too tired?

178
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Maybe

179
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Mo Luo Bo

180
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You're eating this with your tummy?

181
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
This fresh fruit is good for your health

182
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,600
Especially this orange

183
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm full

184
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Right, you're not in the body temperature

185
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
How is it?

186
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Just a small injury

187
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Too many scars

188
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And you're sorry

189
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
All the police are almost done

190
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The doctor said

191
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
The last assessment

192
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Will come out tomorrow

193
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And then you can decide to leave

194
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That's just two days

195
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You can probably leave

196
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You said the examination is over

197
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You want to be a super unhealthy

198
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Super unhealthy food for me?

199
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I haven't eaten meat for a long time

200
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Hurry up and eat

201
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm hungry

202
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Are you okay?

203
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm fine

204
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Maybe my eyes are a little sensitive

205
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'll drink more water

206
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And take off my medicine

207
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm fine

208
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Really

209
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
My stomach

210
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm starving

211
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The beef you made for me last time

212
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Yes

213
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
But I lost my appetite

214
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Who would do that?

215
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's delicious

216
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Who taught you that?

217
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
My dad

218
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
This beef rice

219
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Is made for the most important person

220
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Guangxi

221
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You're my most important person now

222
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Good

223
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Your dad left you such a good memory

224
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
My dad left everything to me

225
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And then he left

226
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Your dad has been in the hall

227
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And left a lot of things to do

228
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You guessed it

229
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That little boy is me

230
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
If my dad was still there

231
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I would know how to be a man

232
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
To face all this

233
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But he left me so little memory

234
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
From now on

235
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'll take it back to you

236
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Okay

237
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But beef rice

238
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Can't be considered as memory

239
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'll know every day

240
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Did you hear that?

241
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yes

242
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Li Qing

243
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What's wrong?

244
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
There are three more hours until the day of the ceremony

245
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Go to have a physical checkup

246
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
We're meeting at ten o'clock

247
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'll help her to use the bathroom

248
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'll take care of her

249
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Okay

250
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Okay

251
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Okay

252
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Okay

253
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'll go to the bathroom

254
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'll take care of her

255
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Okay

256
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Okay

257
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Is it ten o'clock?

258
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'll help her to use the bathroom

259
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Three hours later

260
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Li Qing has been coming to the hospital with me

261
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
She's busy taking care of me

262
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You're going to be a doctor

263
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And you're going to sleep

264
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You're so lazy

265
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You're sick

266
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'll have a physical checkup first

267
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I've already made a reservation for you

268
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's almost lunchtime

269
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
After the checkup

270
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
We'll meet at the coffee shop

271
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And we'll listen to the report together

272
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Let's go

273
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'll go back

274
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'll很痛

275
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'll go back to work

276
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I can't understand

277
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:05,960
Your急

278
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,960
Li Qing

279
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,800
Please

280
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,280
You need to rest

281
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,000
Huadai

282
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,960
An urgent problem

283
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,000
You won't believe me

284
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm sorry.

285
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Do you have any other health problems?

286
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Nothing.

287
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm just tired.

288
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I can't sleep easily.

289
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Maybe I'm tired recently.

290
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Okay.

291
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Let's go to the doctor's.

292
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Please go out to the right.

293
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Okay. Thank you.

294
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm sorry.

295
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Kui Si.

296
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Kui Si.

297
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
What's wrong?

298
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Nothing.

299
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Are you okay?

300
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Kui Si.

301
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Kui Si.

302
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Kui Si.

303
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Kui Si.

304
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Kui Si.

305
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Kui Si.

306
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Kui Si.

307
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Kui Si.

308
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Kui Si.

309
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Kui Si.

310
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Kui Si.

311
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
After we're done,

312
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
we're getting engaged.

313
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Please.

314
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It's the 21st century.

315
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
The technology is so advanced.

316
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
The efficiency of the treatment is getting higher.

317
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
If you're willing,

318
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
you can come and wash your feet.

319
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I'll definitely come.

320
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'll definitely go to the washroom.

321
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
The position of the left and right is more important than you think.

322
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The time you find is too late.

323
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
The situation in the whole day is not optimistic.

324
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
When can we do the operation?

325
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's already scheduled.

326
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
We can move it the day after tomorrow.

327
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Is the rate of treatment still so low?

328
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm sorry.

329
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'll do my best.

330
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Guang Xi.

331
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Think about the treatment of the operation.

332
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Doctor.

333
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You can arrange the operation.

334
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I believe you.

335
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Mom.

336
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Thank you for accompanying me.

337
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm sick for a while.

338
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I finally realized that you're my son.

339
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
If you really care about me,

340
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
don't force me anymore.

341
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I want to go to the toilet.

342
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You go to the coffee shop.

343
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'll go find Mo Zeng.

344
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Go.

345
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It's me.

346
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Go to the coffee shop to find me.

347
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Don't pretend to be me.

348
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
My heart is deeply hurt,

349
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
but I won't forget.

350
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
President Fang.

351
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You call me.

352
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Sit down.

353
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Do you know why I came to the hospital?

354
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You're also here to see Guang Xi's report.

355
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
The report is finished.

356
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It's not optimistic.

357
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
The tumor is deep.

358
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I think Guang Xi doesn't want you to worry about his illness

359
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
and make you open up.

360
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Are you very worried?

361
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Maybe I should let you know

362
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
that Guang Xi is not hiding your opinion.

363
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Actually, his depression can be improved.

364
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
But he gave up on you.

365
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
This is the record of yesterday's meeting with my father-in-law.

366
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
The data from the Liya Group

367
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
has been analyzed.

368
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
If Guang Xi is in the treatment,

369
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
the treatment of the tumor can be increased to 30%.

370
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I've already sent the data back to Taipei

371
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
and let my father prepare the operation of the tumor.

372
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I and the Liya Group

373
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
will be back in Taiwan after about two hours.

374
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
We'll be back tomorrow night.

375
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
If Guang Xi is still not willing to accept my father's help,

376
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
please tell me.

377
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Let me convince him.

378
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I really hope that I can cure Guang Xi.

379
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I must save him.

380
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I believe that you can tell

381
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
how much you care about Guang Xi.

382
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And your father,

383
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
who is the one who can save Guang Xi,

384
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
is the most important person in Taiwan.

385
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
He cares a lot about your relationship with Guang Xi.

386
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
The report today

387
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
is not optimistic.

388
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
But Guang Xi is willing to take 15% of his risk,

389
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
and is not willing to accept the treatment.

390
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Do you know why?

391
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Because he said he didn't want to owe the He family.

392
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
He could have kept you safe.

393
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Even if he died, he didn't care.

394
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
But he cares about me.

395
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I believe that you care about him too.

396
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
What do you want me to do?

397
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I'll do it as a hand-pick.

398
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
But this is just a scene from the show.

399
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
After he entered the surgery room and accepted the anesthesia,

400
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
we immediately helped him do the treatment.

401
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
But before that,

402
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I want you to be like Ping Cheng,

403
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
to be like the master of the show,

404
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
to be with him,

405
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
until he leaves the surgery room smoothly.

406
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
After the surgery,

407
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
how do you think you should report to him

408
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
about the relationship between his father and Guang Xi?

409
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I'm here.

410
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Help me clean up the things I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.

411
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I've been thinking about taking care of my hair.

412
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

413
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I'm not sure.

414
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I'm not sure.

415
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm not sure.

416
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I'm not sure.

417
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I'm not sure.

418
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I'm not sure.

419
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I thought if I had to take care of my hair,

420
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I would be so annoyed.

421
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I've never taken care of my hair.

422
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
We've told you the results of the check-up.

423
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
You must be scared now.

424
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
In front of me,

425
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
you don't need to pretend to be brave.

426
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
You can be scared.

427
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I thought until the end,

428
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I could pretend to be brave.

429
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Then let's stop for a while.

430
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
What?

431
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
No medicine.

432
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
No check-up.

433
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
No hospital.

434
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Stop being a patient one day.

435
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Just pretend to be your own Guang Xi.

436
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Mo Zhi.

437
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
You're a close friend.

438
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
We've been to many places together since we started dating.

439
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Only the hospital

440
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
and the shop next to the hospital.

441
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I don't know if I'm your girlfriend

442
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
or your friend.

443
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
You're so strict every day.

444
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Are you in love or being sick?

445
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Tomorrow,

446
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
we'll go to a date.

447
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Before you get married,

448
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
you should relax.

449
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I'm not so sure.

450
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I've grown up.

451
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
The first time a woman made a promise to me,

452
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
where do you want to go?

453
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I'm not sure.

454
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I'm not sure.

455
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I'm not sure.

456
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I'm not sure.

457
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I'm not sure.

458
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I'm not sure.

459
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I'm not sure.

460
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I'm not sure.

461
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I'm not sure.

462
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I'm not sure.

463
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I'm not sure.

464
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I'm not sure.

465
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I'm not sure.

466
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I'm not sure.

467
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Before got married,

468
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I had already thought.

469
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
But then...

470
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I just saw her.

471
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And you dine with her.

472
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I still have nothing to fear.

473
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
The date you want is just a chance to come to the park.

474
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You know the answer now?

475
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I know.

476
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
It's because it's something that two people do.

477
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Someone can go anywhere they want.

478
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Someone can respond to anything they say.

479
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Because it's something that two people do.

480
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Even if it's boring,

481
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
he's already so happy.

482
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Actually, I don't know if he's happy or not.

483
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Actually, I don't know either.

484
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I just want to do something with you.

485
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Something that ordinary people do.

486
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
You're the first guy I like.

487
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
When I'm with you,

488
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I'll feel so happy.

489
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
So I don't dare to go anywhere.

490
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Just like this now,

491
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
seeing people on the court,

492
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I'm happy.

493
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
If you can be like this every day,

494
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
how good would that be?

495
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
You're done with your surgery.

496
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I'll come back here.

497
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
And one day, I'll be like them.

498
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
The End

499
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
You should try it.

500
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
What the two of you are doing is...

501
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
You're going to start a new life.

502
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I'll help you.

503
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
You haven't made a date yet?

504
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
It seems that the first love isn't a lie.

505
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
This thing should be done by a boyfriend.

506
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
You're the one who won the prize today.

507
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Don't forget.

508
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I suddenly thought of something.

509
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Only two of us can do it.

510
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
What is it?

511
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
It's this.

512
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
The Deep Swim

513
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,500
Still花 song

514
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,300
It's a happy day

515
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,900
It's my turn

516
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,100
A date

517
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,700
This is my date

518
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,700
I ate where you want to go

519
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,300
Isn't it my turn?

520
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,900
Where do you want to go?

521
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,300
I'm afraid that we're going to be dirty

522
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,500
Let's take a break first

523
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,500
Hold on

524
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,300
Here, here,

525
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:17,900
drink a cup of coffee

526
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,900
Come through

527
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:19,900
Yes, go ahead

528
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,320
Even if the sangtan is not over

529
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:23,900
Old drinking

530
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,100
niemand angle

531
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:24,500
Yu Le chang

532
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:24,900
Therefore, what's different was that

533
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:29,700
Touch stroke

534
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,580
Sun цел

535
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:30,860
Ten États

536
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:36,420
The靈

537
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,020
Fan

538
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,660
Fan

539
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:48,660
The more you reward the more you reward the more you get the chance to join the 9994466.com

540
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:54,660
I would like to ask you why only this girl is the only one who is in charge of the whole project?

541
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:59,660
Because my project is only for the personnel to take photos.

542
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,660
Then who is this girl?

543
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,660
She is my wife.

544
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:13,660
She is already 40 years old.

545
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,660
At that time, she was 20 years old.

546
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:25,660
A car accident caused me to lose her and my right leg.

547
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,660
Sorry.

548
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,660
It's okay.

549
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,660
When I was young, I was a photographer.

550
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:47,660
I didn't know how beautiful the scenery and the people were.

551
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:56,660
But until the day she left, I found out that we never took photos together.

552
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:01,660
Because I am a photographer and always a person who grows up.

553
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,660
I couldn't have any photo with her.

554
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:13,660
If time can turn around, how good would that be?

555
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,660
Of course, that's impossible.

556
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:23,660
But if there is a magic that can stop time, that is photography.

557
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,660
Isn't it?

558
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:30,660
Photography is a magic that can turn into eternity in an instant.

559
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,660
Thank you.

560
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,660
It's been 40 years.

561
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,660
I can't help but to recall her.

562
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,660
After so long,

563
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:07,660
I have forgotten that she looked like she had forgotten to smile.

564
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:15,660
If possible, I would rather forget the way back home.

565
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:21,660
I don't want to forget every detail about her.

566
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,660
So, every time I press the shutter,

567
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:32,660
I don't want to take beautiful things or photos.

568
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:38,660
I just want to keep every guest forever.

569
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,660
I don't want to forget the moment.

570
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,660
Let's start.

571
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,660
Let's start.

572
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,660
Excuse me.

573
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:43,660
Do you want to put the photo in the light stick or here?

574
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,660
What is this?

575
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,660
There is a memory card here.

576
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,160
This is the hot and sour product from our store.

577
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:58,160
Some customers say it can bring good luck.

578
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,160
But it's useless, I don't know.

579
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,160
Okay, that's all.

580
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,660
Okay, I'll put the photo in the light stick.

581
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,660
I'll give you this.

582
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,160
It's a lucky card, no one will owe it to you.

583
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,660
Okay.

584
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,660
I'll bring it to you.

585
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,660
Okay.

586
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,660
I'll leave it to you.

587
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,660
You can take it tomorrow.

588
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,660
Thank you.

589
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,660
I want to ask you.

590
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,660
Where is your wife's photo?

591
00:38:55,660 --> 00:39:00,660
I want to ask you where is your wife's photo?

592
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,160
What's wrong?

593
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,660
I'm tired.

594
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,160
You can walk slower.

595
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,160
This way you can walk longer.

596
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,660
Don't let go of your hand.

597
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,660
Isn't the movie so strict?

598
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,160
I'm not a good girl.

599
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,160
I'm not a good girl.

600
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,160
I'm not a good girl.

601
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,160
I'm not a good girl.

602
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,160
I'm not a good girl.

603
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,160
I'm not a good girl.

604
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,160
I'm not a good girl.

605
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,160
I'm not a good girl.

606
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,160
I'm not a good girl.

607
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,160
I'm not a good girl.

608
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,160
I'm not a good girl.

609
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,160
I'm not a good girl.

610
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,160
I'm not a good girl.

611
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,160
I'm not a good girl.

612
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,660
Go away.

613
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,160
You know what I'm going to ask Suddenly,

614
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,160
I ask her if there will be a real sister

615
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,160
tomorrow.

616
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,160
앞іdonk

617
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:47,660
Could you leave in a moment

618
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,660
to practice daughter-in-law?

619
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:52,660
Move over

620
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:57,660
I'm afraid my dream will be broken

621
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:05,660
My love, I'm not afraid of the past

622
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:11,660
I can't let the past be in the war

623
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:20,660
Love, I'm not afraid of the past

624
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:28,660
Love, I'm not afraid of the past

625
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:31,660
Mr. Yang Chun-sir, Miss Ye Ziting

626
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:34,660
You are here today to celebrate the Christmas

627
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,660
During the Christmas and the holidays

628
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,660
And the Christmas holidays

629
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,660
Mr. Yang Chun-sir

630
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:43,660
Do you want to marry Miss Ye Ziting

631
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,660
As your wife?

632
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,660
No matter if she is sick or healthy

633
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:52,660
You are willing to love her, protect her and respect her

634

One day, one minute

Let me still be my dream

00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:50,660
We are ready

661
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,660
If the light can enter the kitchen

662
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,660
Everything will be done

663
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:00,660
Ye Qian, thank you

664
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,660
Aunt Fang

665
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,660
I really care about the light

666
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,660
That's why I'm doing this

667
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,660
It's very important

668
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:13,660
If the light can pass the difficult time

669
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,660
I will apologize to her

670
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:20,660
I still have something to discuss with you

671
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,660
I'm leaving

672
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:50,660
You sent me to Boston and met me before

673
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:52,660
I let Guangxi know your arrangement

674
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:53,660
That's really good

675
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:56,660
You still have a chance to regret

676
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,660
What's wrong with letting Guangxi live?

677
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:07,660
That Liang Mu Chen

678
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:09,660
It's time to send Guangxi back

679
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:18,660
I'm sorry

680
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:24,660
Time flies

681
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,660
You have to open the knife tomorrow

682
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,660
You must be bored to wait for me

683
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,660
I've already checked for you

684
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,660
I have a rest

685
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:34,660
I can watch TV or magazines

686
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,660
After the surgery tomorrow

687
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,660
When I wake up

688
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,660
Help me prepare the beef rice

689
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,660
I want to eat

690
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,660
Maybe I'll stay in the hospital for a while

691
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:51,660
You have to help me prepare

692
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:00,660
If I don't wake up

693
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,660
You will

694
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,660
Don't talk to those silent words

695
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,660
Mu Chen

696
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,660
Let me talk to you

697
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,660
If I don't talk now

698
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,660
You may have a chance to

699
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,660
No, if

700
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:23,660
After you tell me what you want to say

701
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:25,660
After you wake up

702
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:28,660
Tell me slowly

703
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:33,660
Okay

704
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,660
I'm sorry

705
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:49,660
I'm sorry

706
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:51,660

I'm sorry

715
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,660
I'm sorry

716
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,660
I'm sorry

717
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:13,660
I'm sorry

718
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,660
I'm sorry

719
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,660
I'm sorry

720
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,660
I'm sorry

721

I'm sorry

724
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,660
I'm sorry

725
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,660
I'm sorry

726
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:31,660
I'm sorry

727
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,660
Thank you

728
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,660
thank you

729
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:41,660
Thanks

730
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:45,900
I wanna be with you

731
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:52,300
How could you put yourself down

732
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:57,380
so thoroughly on my side

733
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,020
Yike,

734
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,180
I remember this song

735
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,500
However,

736
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,700
you never tried

737
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:12,700
How can you laugh so hard?

738
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,700
No.

739
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:18,700
I'm waiting for you.

740
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,700
I want to see your most beautiful smile.

741
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:25,700
Do you know that?

742
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,700
I will succeed in my life.

743
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:43,700
You have to be fine.

744
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:47,700
When you wake up,

745
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:51,700
I will have a whole new life waiting for you.

746
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:01,700
I will be with you in that life.

747
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,700
I will be with you in that life.

748
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:08,700
When you wake up,

749
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:13,700
I will be with you in that life.

750
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,700
I will be with you in that life.

751
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:42,700
I will be with you in that life.

752
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:43,700
Don't look down on me.

753
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,700
You will take good care of yourself.

754
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:03,700
Wang Xin,

755
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:05,700
are you getting your surgery done?

756
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:19,700
Mom.

757
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:22,700
Xixi.

758
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,700
Let me get my surgery done.

759
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,700
There is still a period of time to be forgiven.

760
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:41,700
If...

761
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,700
If I can pass this level,

762
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:53,700
I will...

763
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:57,700
I will...

764
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,700
change my way of life.

765
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,700
I will learn from you.

766
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,700
How to be a good son?

767
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:17,700
You should know that

768
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,700
everything that Mom has done is for you.

769
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:32,700
Mom.

770
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:02,700
Mom.

771
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:24,700
Wait for me.

772
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,700
I'm sorry for taking you to the hospital.

773
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,700
I'm sorry for taking you to the hospital.

774
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:30,700
I'm sorry.

775
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,700
I'm sorry for taking you to the hospital.

776
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:36,700
Wang Xin.

777
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:37,700
Wang Xin.

778
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,700
Wang Xin.

779
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:43,700
Wang Xin.

780
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:45,700
Wang Xin.

781
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:00,700
Wang Xin.

782
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:30,700
Wang Xin.

783
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:37,700
Wang Xin.

784
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,700
We are going to help you pack your things.

785
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:40,700
Please come to the bathroom.

786
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:43,700
What are you doing?

787
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,700
Mr. Wang Xin, I'm sorry.

788
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,700
We can't take the surgery with us.

789
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,700
Please hold the bag.

790
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:55,700
Okay.

791
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:01,700
Please relax.

792
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,700
You can close your eyes now.

793
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,700
Think about it.

794
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,700
Even if you let go of someone,

795
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,700
it's not important.

796
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:11,700
Don't be nervous.

797
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:24,700
What do you want me to do?

798
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:26,700
I'll do the surgery.

799
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:28,700
But...

800
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,700
This is just a scene that Wang Xin saw.

801
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:34,700
Until he enters the surgery room,

802
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,700
and accepts the anesthesia,

803
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:39,700
we will immediately do the treatment for him.

804
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,700
As for the operation,

805
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,700
how do you think you should report to him

806
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,700
and the father's negative effects on Wang Xin?

807
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:00,700
I know.

808
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,700
When he enters the surgery room,

809
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:08,700
I will leave Wang Xin.

810
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:30,700
You did well.

811
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:32,700
You can leave now.

812
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:37,700
Just a little.

813
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:39,700
We are all doing this for Wang Xin.

814
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,700
I can't say I haven't loved anyone.

815
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,700
I have never been sad.

816
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,700
I also want to say

817
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:42,700
that maybe I can still rub my tears.

818
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,700
You always ask me if I am the one who cares.

819
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,700
How can I not?

820
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,700
Mr. Wang is really straightforward.

821
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,700
He's clearly in love with Wang Xin.

822
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,700
But he didn't let me down.

823
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,700
Mr. He agrees to accept the treatment.

824
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:00,700
to accept the only condition of the quality treatment

825
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:02,700
You don't want to let the past know

826
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:05,700
that Guangxi and that girl had a relationship

827
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:09,700
That girl is not the ideal partner of Guangxi

828
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,700
It used to be

829
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,700
I hope that Guangxi will be able to start over again

830
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,700
in the future

831
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:24,700
I hope that Guangxi can be able to hold on to this relationship

832
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,700
and not let the past down

833
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:30,700
I said I didn't love

834
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,700
I said I didn't wait

835
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,700
I said I didn't wait

836
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,700
I also want to say

837
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:38,700
that maybe I can forget

838
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,700
but I still want to touch

839
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:42,700
You always ask me

840
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,700
where my heart is

841
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,700
I ask my regret

842
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:48,700
and I have to go to love

843
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,700
and my tears

844
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:54,700
how to stay

845
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,700
You always ask me

846
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,700
where my heart is

847
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,700
I ask my regret

848
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:02,700
and I have to go to love

849
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,700
and my tears

850
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:05,700
I always say

851
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,700
I am sure that the quality treatment is enough

852
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,700
Generally speaking, it is not a problem

853
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:10,700
if you sleep for 2-3 hours

854
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:12,700
You can definitely complete this treatment

855
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,700
I have never had a sedative patient

856
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:17,700
in order to give him an operation to save his own life

857
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,700
I am very happy

858
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,700
I am very happy

859
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:32,700
I am very happy

860
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,700
I am very happy

861
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:36,700
I am very happy

862
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,700
I am very happy

863
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,700
I am very happy

864
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:42,700
I am very happy

865
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:44,700
I am very happy

866
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,700
I am very happy

867
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,700
I am very happy

868
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,700
I am very happy

869
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:52,700
I am very happy

870
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,700
I am very happy

871
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:56,700
I am very happy

872
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,700
I am very happy

873
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:25,200
Guan Xi!

874
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:25,900
Calm down!

875
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,400
Guan Xi, listen to me.

876
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,700
I'm so tired of this.

877
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,200
Guan Xi, calm down.

878
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,200
Calm down.

879
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,200
Calm down.

880
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,700
Wait, you're so bad.

881
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,200
You don't need to hold my mom.

882
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,200
Guan Xi!

883
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,200
Guan Xi, calm down.

884
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,200
We're trying to help you get the shock.

885
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,200
We're trying to help you get the shock.

886
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,200
This is the whole operation process.

887
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,700
Guan Xi, calm down.

888
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:52,700
Guan Xi!

889
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:53,700
Guan Xi!

890
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:56,700
Guan Xi, calm down.

891
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:57,700
Guan Xi!

892
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:58,700
Why are you running away?

893
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:00,700
You said you were running away.

894
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:01,700
Guan Xi, what happened?

895
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:02,700
Guan Xi, what happened?

896
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:03,700
I just found out that

897
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:04,700
Guan Xi knew that

898
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:05,700
You changed your doctor's license

899
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:06,700
to get the shock.

900
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:08,700
Where am I now?

901
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,700
You sold it to someone else.

902
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,700
You're not going anywhere, are you?

903
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,700
Is it because he left you?

904
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:16,700
No way!

905
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:18,700
You don't understand?

906
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:19,700
Even if I'm fine,

907
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:20,700
if it's not for him,

908
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,700
I'll never come back.

909
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:23,700
Guan Xi!

910
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:24,700
Guan Xi!

911
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:26,700
Guan Xi!

912
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:27,700
Guan Xi!

913
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:28,700
Guan Xi!

914
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:29,700
Guan Xi!

915
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:30,700
Guan Xi!

916
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:35,700
Dr. Chen,

917
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:36,700
are you really sure

918
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,700
you're leaving Guan Xi like this?

919
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:42,700
Don't you think it's good

920
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:44,700
if you don't tell him anything?

921
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:46,700
Whether it's good or bad

922
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:47,700
doesn't matter.

923
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:48,700
The most important thing is

924
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:50,700
that Guan Xi can survive.

925
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:52,700
Why are you like this?

926
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:55,700
You look very sad.

927
01:00:58,700 --> 01:00:59,700
He's now

928
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:01,700
fighting with death.

929
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,700
But I can't be with him.

930
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:07,700
I can only tell myself

931
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:09,700
that this choice is right.

932
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:11,700
And my mission

933
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:13,700
has been completed.

934
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:25,700
Next,

935
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,700
let the person who has the ability

936
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:29,700
to sleep in Guan Xi.

937
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:54,700
Sorry

938
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:56,700
I 결婚

939
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:58,900
I'm sorry.

940
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,900
I'm sorry.

941
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,900
I'm sorry.

942
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,900
I'm sorry.

943
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:06,900
I'm sorry.

944
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:08,900
I'm sorry.

945
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,900
I'm sorry.

946
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:12,900
I'm sorry.

947
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,900
Hey, Hong Chen.

948
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:18,900
I'll give you another one.

949
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,300
I'm sorry.

950
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:31,300
I'm sorry.

951
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:33,300
I'm sorry.

952
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:35,300
I'm sorry.

953
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:38,700
I must take it apart.

954
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:40,900
I can't let go.

955
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:43,700
But now, things are all over.

956
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:48,300
I can't let go of everything I want.

957
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:58,700
You're the one who's going to take me?

958
01:02:58,700 --> 01:02:59,700
You...

959
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:00,700
Answer me!

960
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:01,700
Where are you going?

961
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:03,700
Why are you being with her?

962
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:06,700
She's taking me with her.

963
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:07,700
I'm leaving.

964
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,700
I want to leave.

965
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:12,700
I'll go.

966
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:14,700
You...

967
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:15,700
I'm leaving.

968
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:16,700
I'm leaving.

969
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:18,700
I'm leaving.

970
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:20,700
I'm leaving.

971
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:21,700
I'm leaving.

972
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:22,700
I'm leaving.

973
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:23,700
I'm leaving.

974
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:24,700
I'm leaving.

975
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:25,700
I'm leaving.

976
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:27,700
Are you okay?

977
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:28,700
Are you okay?

978
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:29,700
Are you okay?

979
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:30,700
I'm leaving.

980
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:31,700
I'm leaving.

981
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:33,700
I'm begging you.

982
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:34,700
Wait for me in the car.

983
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:36,700
Mo Chen.

984
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:37,700
Mo Chen.

985
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:42,700
Mo Chen.

986
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:44,700
Mo Chen.

987
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:45,700
Mo Chen.

988
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:46,700
Mo Chen.

989
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:47,700
Mo Chen.

990
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:58,700
You're really bad at acting.

991
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:22,700
Don't tell me

992
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:24,700
that you're leaving me because of her health.

993
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:28,700
I know that my mom forced you.

994
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:31,700
Your mom didn't force me.

995
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,700
I decided to leave her.

996
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:40,700
You...

997
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:43,700
I'm not a fool!

998
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:48,700
The contract of the contract is signed.

999
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:49,700
You're not in the line.

1000
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:51,700
You're not seeing her anymore.

1001
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:53,700
If it weren't for my mom,

1002
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:54,700
you wouldn't have left me.

1003
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:55,700
Yes.

1004
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:57,700
I wouldn't have left you.

1005
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:00,700
I promised to walk with you.

1006
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:03,700
I realized that

1007
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:05,700
it's impossible.

1008
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:10,700
What are you talking about?

1009
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:17,700
The wedding is cancelled.

1010
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:20,700
Jia Da is dead before the surgery.

1011
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:22,700
The other day,

1012
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:24,700
I met Huizi.

1013
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:27,700
She spent two hours

1014
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:29,700
and couldn't fill her name.

1015
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,700
She was a good person.

1016
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:34,700
She left after the surgery.

1017
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:36,700
Do you remember?

1018
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,700
Jia Da's situation is even more optimistic than yours.

1019
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:43,700
Now,

1020
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:45,700
there are only three words

1021
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:47,700
that are meaningless in the death certificate.

1022
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:49,700
That day,

1023
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:51,700
I found out that

1024
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:53,700
I had to walk with you.

1025
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:55,700
It was so naive.

1026
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:58,700
I was scared at first.

1027
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,700
I thought you would leave me one day.

1028
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:04,700
Like my mom,

1029
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:06,700
like my dad,

1030
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:09,700
and like aunt Xiaoxiao.

1031
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:12,700
I've sent too many people away.

1032
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:15,700
I don't want to send others away.

1033
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:17,700
So this time,

1034
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:19,700
I decided to leave first.

1035
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:23,700
But your mom begged me

1036
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:26,700
to play this game

1037
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,700
so that you can have a peaceful time.

1038
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:33,700
You're lying.

1039
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:35,700
You're lying.

1040
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:40,700
We were happy yesterday.

1041
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,700
We all need that happiness.

1042
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:45,700
You're happy now.

1043
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:47,700
That's why you can face the surgery today.

1044
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:49,700
I'm happy.

1045
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:51,700
But you can finish the task well.

1046
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:53,700
You must be the first man I fell in love with.

1047
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:55,700
I don't want to come back.

1048
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:57,700
It's all because of you.

1049
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:01,700
Sorry for telling you.

1050
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:04,700
Yesterday,

1051
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:07,700
it was all fake.

1052
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:11,700
It's true.

1053
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:13,700
I still remember that I was calling him.

1054
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:15,700
I didn't say I was wrong.

1055
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:17,700
But I'm really being honest.

1056
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:20,700
I don't want to lie in front of Tianfu.

1057
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:24,700
I can't give you the happiness of my life.

1058
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:26,700
I can't do it.

1059
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:32,700
I'm sorry.

1060
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:35,700
I know you.

1061
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:38,700
I'm sorry.

1062
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:41,700
I'm sorry.

1063
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:45,700
I'm sorry.

1064
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:16,700
Tu.

1065
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:22,700
He's leaving.

1066
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:24,700
He's leaving now.

1067
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:26,700
I've packed everything.

1068
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:29,700
I came here on purpose.

1069
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:32,700
It's because he can give me a medical checkup and a medical checkup.

1070
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:35,700
I even let Xiao Le go to him.

1071
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:39,700
Why can't you go back to your surgery and have a good time?

1072
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,700
Don't be so greedy.

1073
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:46,700
You don't even know if you'll be alive tomorrow.

1074
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:49,700
You can't give me the medical checkup.

1075
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:51,700
You can't give me the medical checkup.

1076
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:54,700
You can go.

1077
01:08:58,700 --> 01:08:59,700
How much is it?

1078
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:00,700
How much?

1079
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:01,700
How much?

1080
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:02,700
How much?

1081
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:03,700
How much?

1082
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:04,700
How much?

1083
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:06,700
How much?

1084
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:09,700
How much?

1085
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:11,700
How much?

1086
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:15,700
How much?

1087
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:17,700
How much?

1088
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:18,700
Okay.

1089
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:41,700
I'm going to leave.

1090
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:43,700
Don't move.

1091
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:45,700
I'm going to leave.

1092
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:46,700
What's wrong?

1093
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:48,700
You're here.

1094
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:50,700
Let's go together.

1095
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:53,700
Don't move.

1096
01:09:58,700 --> 01:09:59,700
Don't move.

1097
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:00,700
Don't move.

1098
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:02,700
Don't move.

1099
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:07,700
Don't move.

1100
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:12,700
Get out of the way.

1101
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:13,700
Get out of the way.

1102
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:16,700
Get out of the way.

1103
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:31,700
Wu Chen.

1104
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:34,700
When you received the photo,

1105
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:36,700
I might have been in the surgery room

1106
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:40,700
to fight for our future.

1107
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:44,700
Or maybe I failed.

1108
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:47,700
I want to thank the boss of the restaurant

1109
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:49,700
for sending me this photo.

1110
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:51,700
I can only tell you

1111
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:53,700
the words that can't be said.

1112
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:57,700
Thank you for being in front of me.

1113
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:00,700
After I left my father,

1114
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:03,700
it was the best memory in my life.

1115
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:08,700
If I can only choose the second child,

1116
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:11,700
I hope that this moment

1117
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:13,700
will be the best.

1118
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:17,700
I know that I promised you

1119
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:19,700
that I would win this battle.

1120
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:22,700
But if I don't follow the promise,

1121
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:25,700
I will do it.

1122
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,700
You go home and sleep.

1123
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:31,700
When the sun rises,

1124
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:33,700
you will be the 11th horse

1125
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:37,700
in the race of the sun and everything else.

1126
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:41,700
You have a long, long dream.

1127
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:45,700
You should forget your dream.

1128
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:47,700
Don't cry.

1129
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:50,700
Don't be sad or sad for her.

1130
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:52,700
When you meet someone

1131
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:54,700
who can create new memories with you,

1132
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:58,700
please accept her and live happily.

1133
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:01,700
And then,

1134
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:04,700
you just have to think about me all the time.

1135
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:05,700
That's enough.

1136
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:08,700
I will protect you

1137
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,700
in another world.

1138
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:14,700
I love you the most.

1139
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:16,700
Guangxi.

1140
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:23,700
Guangxi.

1141
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:24,700
Guangxi.

1142
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:55,700
I love you the most.

1143
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:08,700
Stop the car.

1144
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:15,700
My dear, my dear, my dear.

1145
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:18,700
My dear, my dear.

1146
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:20,700
Miss Liang,

1147
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:21,700
hasn't she come to the fair yet?

1148
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:23,700
She has always thought that her final ticket

1149
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:24,700
was because she was too tired.

1150
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,700
Actually, she is tired.

1151
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:29,700
Miss Liang.

1152
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:31,700
Baby, baby.

1153
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:32,700
Have you finished your lunch?

1154
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,700
You, the rain-sweeping baby,

1155
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:36,700
come back to eat.

1156
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:39,700
It's been a long, long time.

1157
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:41,700
The alien baby

1158
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:44,700
drove his rain-sweeping baby to the earth.

1159
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:46,700
The baby suddenly fell down

1160
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:47,700
and was in front of the car.

1161
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:48,700
Idiot.

1162
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:50,700
There is no alien in the world.

1163
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:52,700
Who said that he has no baby?

1164
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:54,700
I am the baby on the earth.

1165
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,700
So I will take care of him

1166
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:57,700
when he comes back.

1167
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:59,700
Idiot.

1168
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:02,700
I don't have any memories.

1169
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:04,700
You are not telling me

1170
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:06,700
that the baby is a baby.

1171
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:08,700
But he is really important.

1172
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:10,700
I am happy now.

1173
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:11,700
I don't need to think about

1174
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:12,700
the baby I have.

1175
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:14,700
What?

1176
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:15,700
Because I have the egg.

1177
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:16,700
You have to give me

1178
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:18,700
a few hundred hours to design the baby.

1179
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,700
I thought that the surgery has changed

1180
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:21,700
over the years.

1181
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:23,700
But you are still the same.

1182
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:25,700
You are still the one

1183
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:27,700
I knew.

1184
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:29,700
You are my favorite person.

1185
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:31,700
I will be back as soon as possible.

1186
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:33,700
And then,

1187
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:35,700
you will be the most beautiful bride.

1188
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:38,700
I will be the most beautiful bride.

1189
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:39,700
You are the most beautiful bride.

1190
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:40,700
Idiot.

1191
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:41,700
Idiot.

1192
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:42,700
I am the one who told you

1193
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:43,700
to give him a gift.

1194
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:44,700
He has a bad habit.

1195
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:45,700
Bad habit is useless.

1196
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:47,700
I don't know which baby

1197
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:49,700
he is trying to make a big belly.

1198
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:50,700
He is hiding in our garden

1199
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:52,700
to steal the baby.

1200
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:19,700
I am so happy now.

1201
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:21,700
I am so happy now.

1202
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:23,700
I am so happy now.

1203
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:25,700
I am so happy now.

1204
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:27,700
I am so happy now.

1205
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:29,700
I am so happy now.

1206
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:31,700
I am so happy now.

1207
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:33,700
I am so happy now.

1208
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:35,700
I am so happy now.

1209
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:37,700
I am so happy now.

1210
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,700
I am so happy now.

1211
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:41,700
I am so happy now.

1212
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:43,700
I am so happy now.

1213
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:45,700
I am so happy now.

1214
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:47,700
I am so happy now.

1215
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:49,700
I am so happy now.

1216
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:51,700
I am so happy now.

1217
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:53,700
I am so happy now.

1218
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:55,700
I am so happy now.

1219
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:57,700
I am so happy now.

1220
01:15:57,700 --> 01:15:59,700
I am so happy now.

1221
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:01,700
I am so happy now.

1222
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:03,700
I am so happy now.

1223
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:05,700
I am so happy now.

1224
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:07,700
I am so happy now.

1225
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:09,700
I am so happy now.

1226
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:11,700
I am so happy now.

1227
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,700
I am so happy now.

1228
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:15,700
I am so happy now.

1229
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:17,700
I am so happy now.

1230
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:19,700
I am so happy now.

1231
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,700
I am so happy now.

1232
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:23,700
I am so happy now.

1233
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:25,700
I am so happy now.

1234
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:27,700
I am so happy now.

1235
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:29,700
I am so happy now.

1236
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:31,700
I am so happy now.

1237
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:33,700
I am so happy now.

1238
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:35,700
I am so happy now.

1239
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:37,700
I am so happy now.

1240
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:39,700
I am so happy now.

1241
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:41,700
I am so happy now.
