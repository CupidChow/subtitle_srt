1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Next, I'll broadcast for you right away.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,480
Next time, happy birthday.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,400
Why am I still here?

4
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,200
You're in my office.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
How long do you need to eat this painkiller?

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Why didn't you let me know?

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You're so poor. When did you start to care about me?

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm a busybody.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
After I hit the ball, I got hurt.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This is not a injury.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Do you know that your brain has a tumor?

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Mr. Ren, your brain has a tumor that is a few years older than your brain.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's already 5 km long.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It seems that there's been a period of time.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Why is that? How is that possible?

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
There's no reason for the tumor to occur.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's possible that children and young people may have a tumor.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's not that you're not a patient of such a young person.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So you'll have a long headache and have a bad personality.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This is all because of the tumor.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What's my problem? Is it serious?

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This tumor is very close to the brain.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So it causes the tumor to be a failure.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
There are often headaches like you.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And the coma situation like you today.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's all because of this tumor.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This situation is not optimistic.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The only way to treat it is surgery.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Where's the success rate?

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Only 15%.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What if it doesn't occur?

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
From the case of the first year,

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
this tumor has been affected by your life system at any time.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The only way to remove the tumor is the fastest and most effective way.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If you don't do the surgery,

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
there's only a few months left.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Then let's start.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You have to be mentally prepared.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The risk of surgery is very high.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Especially the level of brain tumor.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Even if the surgery is successful,

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
it may be a failure, a failure, a failure,

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
or even a failure.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's a rare disease.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Mr. Ren, I suggest you to get the treatment at the hospital.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And accept the treatment.

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's not a death.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's a white disease.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Guangxi.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Guangxi.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Guangxi.

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Guangxi.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hey, Jester.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I suggest you to get the treatment at the hospital.

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We don't have this one.

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Sorry to interrupt.

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You have a problem?

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Why did you get it?

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I have a problem.

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
He's still breathing.

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
He's trying hard.

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What kind of thing is he trying to do?

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Even if he wants to live...

65
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The top female king, Huang Jincheng,

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Zhao Caimeng,

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and the top captain,

68
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
are very highly compensated.

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
They have more chances to win the prize.

70
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
They are ready to join the competition.

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The first round of the second round is 9994466.

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I have no choice.

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
He has a captain.

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I will throw him away.

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You can't just throw him away.

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
We can't just throw him away.

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I will throw him away.

00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Somebody Who Diszystaed

149
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,400
Quwarm up.

150
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,400
I'm going to the car.

151
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,400
Right. Are you really leaving?

152
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,400
I was the one who got transferred to this school just for Mu Chen.

153
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,400
Now he's found someone who can make him happy.

154
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
So I don't have to stay here anymore.

155
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
Let's go. There's still a busy man to go back.

156
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
I'm going to the car.

157
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,400
I'm going to the car.

158
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Let's go. There's still a busy man to go back.

159
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,400
I'm going to the car.

160
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,400
I didn't know that our medical professors in Shenzhen University are so incompetent.

161
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,400
I asked you to help me find a solution.

162
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
What answer did you get?

163
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
It's the same as the hospital's conspiracy.

164
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,400
What's wrong with this?

165
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,400
President Fang, we're not helping you.

166
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,400
With the current medical technology, we can really choose.

167
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,400
So your advice must be opened.

168
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,400
To avoid the 15% chance of being shot.

169
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Don't be busy.

170
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,400
I won't shoot.

171
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,400
Guangxi, things are still not the way they were given up.

172
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,400
My life has been so hard to change.

173
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,400
Whether I shoot or not, there's really a difference.

174
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,400
Don't waste time.

175
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,400
Guangxi.

176
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
I'll make you live.

177
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,400
That's my bone. I can't lose you.

178
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,400
Can you stop being annoying?

179
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,400
Especially you.

180
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,400
I'm telling you.

181
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,400
I'm the one who started this.

182
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,400
I left my father alone.

183
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,400
I'm going to live with this thief.

184
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,400
So don't bother me anymore.

185
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,400
I really want to kill you.

186
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,400
I want to kill the whole thing with this bastard.

187
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,400
Morning.

188
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,400
It's so rare.

189
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
Didn't you get up early in the morning?

190
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,400
You don't need to practice today.

191
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,400
You can't find anyone all night.

192
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,400
You can come early with that pervert girl.

193
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,400
Not bad.

194
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
You're not going to miss out on anything, right?

195
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,400
So annoying.

196
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Hello.

197
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,400
Guangxi.

198
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,400
We're going to the hotel.

199
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,400
Hello.

200
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,400
What's the matter?

201
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,400
Are you all right?

202
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
I've been waiting for you all night.

203
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,400
I even called your phone.

204
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,400
Why did you call me back? Who am I?

205
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,400
I didn't mean that.

206
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,400
Didn't we make a deal?

207
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
I'll...

208
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,400
Right.

209
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,400
I promised you to eat with me.

210
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,400
I'm sorry.

211
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,400
I met a few girls on the way last night.

212
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,400
They were serious.

213
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,400
I went to the hotel with them.

214
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,400
I forgot to go to the hotel in the morning.

215
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,400
Please.

216
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,400
You're not the first person to know me.

217
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,400
I'm just this type of person.

218
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,400
I'm only three minutes into the heat of a girl.

219
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,400
You know that, right?

220
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,400
The investigation has been over.

221
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,400
I don't feel anything to you.

222
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,400
We're close.

223
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,400
You'll be in trouble.

224
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,400
I'm going to the hotel.

225
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,400
Guangxi.

226
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,400
Oh, my God.

227
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,400
I know now.

228
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,400
Your expression doesn't mean I'm a good person.

229
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
I'm serious.

230
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,400
To be honest, it's just a means to make me win.

231
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,400
If I really treat her like a person,

232
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,400
I can only say sorry.

233
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
I'll make you misunderstand.

234
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,400
Liang Mochen, you're not the type of person I like.

235
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,400
You're boring and difficult to deal with.

236
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
I can't believe I like you.

237
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,400
You're right.

238
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,400
I thought it was a selfish thing.

239
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
I thought that lawsuit

240
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
was very important to you.

241
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,400
I came to see you because I promised you.

242
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,400
So I came to see you.

243
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,400
I'll leave when I get there.

244
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,400
I got it.

245
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,400
Liang Mochen.

246
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,400
No matter what,

247
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,400
no matter what your intention is,

248
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,400
I'm really grateful for everything you've done for me.

249
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:42,400
The lunch box is the dish that my dad and I like the most.

250
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,400
It's like the most precious memory of me.

251
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,400
I hope you'll like it.

252
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,400
I'm sorry.

253
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,400
I'm sorry.

254
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,400
I'm sorry.

255
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
I'm sorry.

256
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,400
I'm sorry.

257
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,400
I'm sorry.

258
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,400
I'm sorry.

259
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,400
I'm sorry.

260
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,400
I'm sorry.

261
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,400
I'm sorry.

262
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,400
I'm sorry.

263
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,400
I'm sorry.

264
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,400
I'm sorry.

265
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,400
I'm sorry.

266
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,400
I'm sorry.

267
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
I'm really sorry.

268
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,400
I'm sorry.

269
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
I'm sorry.

270
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
I'm sorry.

271
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,400
I'm sorry.

272
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,400
Don't be sad.

273
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,400
Because he cares about me.

274
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,400
He always likes me.

275
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,400
Why do he keep ignoring me?

276
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,400
I'll be back soon

277
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,400
You have to be careful

278
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,400
After all, he hasn't fallen

279
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
What about your work?

280
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
What about my life?

281
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
I might go back to the fish market

282
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,400
See if I can get a job

283
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
Don't worry

284
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
Thank you for your concern

285
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,400
I'll be back soon

286
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
I'll be back soon

287
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
I'll be back soon

288
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
I'll be back soon

289
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,400
I'll be back soon

290
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,400
I'm looking for you. You're not coming out of the hospital

291
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,400
You'll be here if you're in a bad mood

292
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,400
I'm not willing to help Guangxi get a doctor's treatment

293
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,400
The rate of success is too low

294
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
Maybe you can take a look at this

295
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
Maybe you can take a look at this

296
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,400
The treatment center for the fish market is developing a plan

297
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,400
What is this?

298
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,400
This is the world's most advanced treatment center

299
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,400
Currently, only the fish company medical center is in Taiwan

300
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,400
Maybe we can ask them to help with the treatment

301
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,400
I'll be back soon

302
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,400
You mean...

303
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,400
The only person in the company who can treat Guangxi

304
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,400
The fish market is developing a plan

305
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
The treatment center is developing a plan

306
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,400
The treatment center is developing a plan

307
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
The treatment center is developing a plan

308
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
The treatment center is developing a plan

309
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
The treatment center is developing a plan

310
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,400
The treatment center is developing a plan

311
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,400
The treatment center is developing a plan

312
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
The treatment center is developing a plan

313
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,400
The treatment center is developing a plan

314
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
The treatment center is developing a plan

315
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
The treatment center is developing a plan

316
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
The treatment center is developing a plan

317
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
The treatment center is developing a plan

318
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
Flowers ofな say

319
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
Crying in the aspect that its like a puppet

320
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
Entering serious г».

321
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,400
night

322
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,400
Does it wanna pay I worth?

323
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,400
After the mathematical situation, we are heading to travel in the 对

324
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,400
and sleep test

325
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,400
You're not going to do this?

326
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,400
Sorry

327
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,400
Sorry

328
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,400
Sorry

329
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,400
Sorry

330
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,400
Sorry

331
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,400
Why are you here at this late hour?

332
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,400
Let's play this new game, the big adventure

333
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,400
Do you want to play?

334
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,400
Do you want to play?

335
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,400
You're going to play the game today, aren't you tired?

336
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,400
Stop talking. Do you want to play?

337
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,400
I want to play for you

338
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,400
Jackal, are you going to play or the big adventure?

339
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,400
Are you going to play?

340
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,400
What do you think of my friend?

341
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,400
Why do you always ask these weird questions?

342
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,400
Why do you suddenly become so grateful?

343
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,400
Stop talking. I'm asking you.

344
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,400
Do you guys regret knowing me?

345
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,400
If I die soon,

346
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,400
what will you do?

347
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,400
First of all,

348
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,400
when your life is so messy,

349
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,400
it's really happy to be with you.

350
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,400
We don't regret knowing you.

351
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,400
But after you die,

352
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,400
you will never regret it.

353
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,400
You will never regret it.

354
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,400
Don't grace your family's preorph�

355
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,400
nor become your target!

356
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,400
I'm glad

357
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,400
it's not the井.

358
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,400
I'm warning you,

359
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,400
not to mention these three words

360
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,400
in front of me!

361
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,400
Why?

362
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,400
I don't understand.

363
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,400
Did you not do anything good while checking the婚 invitation?

364
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,400
What happened to you?

365
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,400
You don't understand much.

366
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,400
I just want to change my taste.

367
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,400
I want to eat some vegetables.

368
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,400
Then I found that I prefer this kind of spicy food.

369
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,400
Liang Mu Chen is different from other women.

370
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,400
And you can tell that you've been serious about her.

371
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,400
So I'm just a liar.

372
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
I'm not lying.

373
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
I'm lying.

374
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
Liang Mu Chen moved to the school's staff dormitory.

375
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
And he went back to the fish market to find a job.

376
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
Zhou Jingcai.

377
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,400
He hasn't found out that you're not worried about him.

378
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,400
You're going to fight for your rights.

379
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,400
And now he's even turning his family upside down.

380
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,400
And he believes in you so much.

381
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,400
He's been in control of A-Chi.

382
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,400
Now you have no family.

383
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,400
Why are you against him?

384
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,400
I'm not interested.

385
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,400
I'm tired of you.

386
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
Do you know that if he's not with you,

387
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,400
that Yuan Nian will go back to his home.

388
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400
And he'll be alone.

389
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,400
So he's going to be a big man.

390
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,400
He's going to be a big man.

391
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,400
He's still working. You care about him.

392
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,400
You're crazy.

393
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,400
You care about him so much.

394
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
I'm happy to have him.

395
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,400
If he's not with me,

396
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,400
I won't believe you.

397
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
You're crazy.

398
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,400
You're crazy.

399
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,400
You're crazy.

400
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,400
Yang Mu Chen is going back to his home.

401
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,400
And he's going back to his former job.

402
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,400
Zhou Jingcai.

403
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,400
He hasn't found out that you're not worried about him.

404
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,400
Yang Mu Chen.

405
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,400
The last one.

406
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
You're going back.

407
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,400
Go back.

408
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
You're going back.

409
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
You're not worried about me.

410
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,400
You're going back.

411
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,400
I'm going back.

412
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,400
I'm going back.

413
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,400
Go back.

414
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,400
Nian.

415
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,400
You're going back.

416
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,400
Go back.

417
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,400
Go back.

418
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,400
Yang Mu Chen.

419
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,400
Yang Mu Chen.

420
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,400
Do you know that if he's not with you,

421
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,400
he'll be alone from now on?

422
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,400
His name is Xia Da'an.

423
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,400
Yu Gang is a big man.

424
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,400
He's really a big man.

425
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,400
He's a big man.

426
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,400
He's a big man.

427
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,400
He's a big man.

428
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,400
He's a big man.

429
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,400
He's a big man.

430
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,400
Yu Gang is a big man.

431
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,400
He's a big man.

432
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,400
I'm going back.

433
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,400
I'm going back.

434
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,400
Come here.

435
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,900
Everyone, take good care of yourself.

cheesing

443
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,320
if you pose a threat

444
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,420
don't take good care of yourself

445
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,960
just set you eyes on him

446
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,080

Tell me

467
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,400
If you want me to be carefree

468
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,400
You will come to save me

469
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,400
I really love her

470
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,400
I will give you a lot of good things

I will be careful

472
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,400
I will not forget the pain

473
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:27,400
We are not in this place

474
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,400
The first place

475
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:35,400
The most important place

476
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,400
But there is still a pity

477
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,400
The day we broke up

478
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:48,400
I can't stop my tears

479
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,400
If that moment comes again

480
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,400
I won't cry

481
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,400
Let her know that I can

482
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,400
I love her

483
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,400
I will be careful

Why do you appear?

498
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,400
You are so heartless

499
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,400
I will go

500
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,400
You will answer my question

501
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,400
I ask you

502
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,400
Why do you appear in my work?

503
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,400
You don't even say a word

504
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,400
How can I tell you?

505
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,400
You should tell me

506
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,400
You don't want to be in the company

507
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,400
You can also tell me

508
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,400
You don't want to care about me

509
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,400
Then tell me that you have no intention to think about it

510
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,400
You are not going to do that

511
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,400
You are too big

512
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,400
You are too small

513
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,400
You don't want to do that

514
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,400
I will go

515
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,400
I will go to the restaurant

516
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,400
Bye

517
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,400
No matter how much you hate me or hate me

518
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,400
This is the last time we are together

519
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,400
I want to ask you one last question

520
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,400
Before I leave

521
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,400
What is it?

522
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,400
Why should I waste my time telling you this?

523
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,400
What are you doing?

524
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,400
I suggest you not waste your time

525
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,400
But we never have a fight

526
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,400
I like you so much

527
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,400
But you said

528
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,400
You can't let go of your hand when you wipe your hands

529
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,400
Don't you remember?

530
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,400
Don't be so naive

531
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,400
How could I care about you so much?

532
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,400
I have no choice but to keep my hand on you

533
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,400
I can't do it

534
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,400
You can't do it?

535
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,400
You are reading a book for me?

536
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,400
You are so good at writing

537
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,400
You saved me from the big city

538
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,400
You didn't even want to be a fake

539
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,400
Don't worry

540
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,400
You can be a fool

541
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,400
Please don't lie to me

542
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,400
If you want to reject me

543
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,400
You can accept my sincere gift

544
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,400
I didn't lie to you

545
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,400
I really can't do it

546
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,400
Because...

547
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,400
I'm dying

548
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
My brain

549
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,400
Only one month left

550
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,400
I can't do it

551
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,400
Because...

552
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,400
I can't do it

553
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,400
I told you

554
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,400
Don't waste your time

555
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,400
I'm so sad

556
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,400
This is my book

557
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,400
I'm sure you will like it

558
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,400
I can write a book

559
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,400
I can't do it

560
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,400
I'm so sad

561
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,400
I can't do it

562
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,400
I don't know why I want to write a book

563
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,400
I really can't do it

564
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,400
I really can't do it

565
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,400
I'm so sad

566
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,400
I'm so sad

567
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,400
I can't do it

568
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,400
I'm so sad

569
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,400
I can't do it

570
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,400
I'm so sad

571
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,400
I can't do it

572
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,400
I'm so sad

573
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,400
I can't do it

574
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,400
I'm so sad

575
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,400
I can't do it

576
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,400
I'm so sad

577
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,400
I can't do it

578
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,400
I'm so sad

579
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,400
I can't do it

580
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,400
I'm so sad

581
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,400
I can't do it

582
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,400
I'm so sad

583
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,400
I can't do it

584
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,400
I'm so sad

585
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,400
I can't do it

586
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,400
I'm so sad

587
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,400
I can't do it

588
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,400
I'm so sad

589
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,400
I can't do it

590
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,400
I'm so sad

591
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,400
I can't do it

592
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,400
I'm so sad

593
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,400
I can't do it

594
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,400
I'm so sad

595
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,400
I can't do it

596
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,400
I'm so sad

597
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,400
I can't do it

598
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,400
I'm so sad

599
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,400
I can't do it

600
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,400
I'm so sad

601
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,400
I can't do it

602
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,400
I'm so sad

603
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,400
I can't do it

604
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,400
I'm so sad

605
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,400
I can't do it

606
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,400
I'm so sad

607
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,400
I can't do it

608
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,400
I'm so sad

609
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,400
I can't do it

610
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,400
I'm so sad

611
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,400
I can't do it

612
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,400
I'm so sad

613
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,400
I can't do it

614
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,400
I'm so sad

615
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,400
I can't do it

616
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,400
I can't do it

617
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,400
What are you doing?

618
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,400
Why don't you get some sleep?

619
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,400
Xiao Chuan

620
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,400
You still need more time

621
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,400
You have to think about it

622
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:08,400
Where is the whole place you said?

623
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:21,400
Hong-fen, are you really mad?

624
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,400
Are you mad?

625
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,400
You can't tell.

626
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,400
Eight years.

627
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,400
He's been in my head for so long.

628
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,400
Are you afraid?

629
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,400
Why should I be afraid?

630
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,400
He's like me.

631
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,400
I've met him before.

632
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,400
When I found out,

633
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,400
I felt better than you.

634
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,400
Congratulations.

635
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,400
He's the one you should follow.

636
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,400
I'm not afraid.

637
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,400
You're really special.

638
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,400
You'll be more brave than I thought.

639
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:38,400
You must be afraid.

640
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,400
Good-bye.

641
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,400
Doctor said that

642
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,400
even if it's a big deal,

643
00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:00,400
the result is only 45% of the success rate.

644
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,400
I'm afraid that

645
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,400
I'll be more brave than you.

646
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,400
I'm afraid that

647
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,400
I'll be more brave than you.

648
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,400
I'm afraid that

649
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,400
even if it's a big deal,

650
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:24,400
the result is only 45% of the success rate.

651
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,400
I'm afraid that

652
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,400
our love

653
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:36,400
is like a chance to be loved.

654
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,400
But

655
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,400
I'm afraid that

656
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,400
it's not over yet.

657
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,400
No matter what he gave us,

658
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,400
as long as it's in the game,

659
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,400
before it's over,

660
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,400
we won't give up.

661
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,400
Then,

662
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,400
we'll have a chance to win.

663
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,400
Congratulations.

664
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,400
Good-bye.

665
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,400
I'll be more brave.

666
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,400
I'm afraid that

667
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,400
even if it's a big deal,

668
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,400
the result is only 45% of the success rate.

669
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,400
I'm afraid that

670
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,400
even if it's a big deal,

671
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,400
the result is only 45% of the success rate.

672
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,400
I'm afraid that

673
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,400
even if it's a big deal,

674
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:57,400
the result is only 45% of the success rate.

675
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:01,400
I'm afraid that

676
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,400
even if it's a big deal,

677
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:11,400
the result is only 45% of the success rate.

678
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,400
I'm afraid that

679
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,400
even if it's a big deal,

680
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,400
the result is only 45% of the success rate.

681
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,400
I'll take you home

682
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,400
Who is it?

683
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:07,400
The End

684
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,400
You've been here all night

685
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,400
It's true that you and Biandangmei are involved

686
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,400
What are you doing here?

687
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,400
I don't want to argue with you today

688
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,400
I have something important to discuss with you

689
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,400
It's about the operation

690
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,400
I accept

691
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,400
I accept all the documents

692
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,400
The operation is not over yet

693
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,400
I still have to take one more

694
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,400
When can I start the operation?

695
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,400
I'll arrange it as soon as possible

696
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,400
Wang Xinyu, you've finally made it clear

697
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,400
Can you stop being so emotional?

698
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,400
I'm not trying to help you

699
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,400
I just found it

700
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,400
I'll wait for you

701
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,400
So you can tell her what you want

702
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,400
Wang Xinyu

703
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,400
And about my illness

704
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,400
Tell Mu Chen that I'm going to fight with her

705
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,400
Go back to the hospital

706
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,400
The End

707
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,400
Mr. Wang Xinyu, come to the building

708
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,400
You won the championship in your 7th grade

709
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,400
I'll be back

710
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,400
It's okay, sit down

711
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,400
I remember he wanted to join the school's contest

712
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,400
But I was suppressed to join the competition

713
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,400
He was still young and didn't know how to judge

714
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,400
Although he didn't want to, he still won the championship

715
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,400
Sometimes I wonder if I'm too strict to him

716
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,400
But the pressure he had on him

717
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,400
He was still growing up

718
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,400
He was able to be a man of his word

719
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,400
He became my only pride

720
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,400
But it's not important anymore

721
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:24,400
I just hope that Heaven will give me a healthy son

722
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,400
Mr. Wang, don't be too sad

723
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,400
Let go of your dirty hands

724
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,400
I know you've been through a lot

725
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,400
I've been a father and a wife

726
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,400
But I don't know how to get along with my parents

727
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,400
You're the only one

728
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,400
So you were in the morning and the night was too late

729
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,400
That's why I know you're a child of a family

730
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,400
Don't explain

731
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,400
I don't want to hear it

732
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,400
For me, health is the most important thing

733
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,400
To be honest, I don't like you

734
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:26,400
But I won't give up on the chance to make Guangxi live a healthy life

735
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,400
I want you to understand why you can be here

736
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,400
It's because we have the same goal

737
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,400
I hope Guangxi can enter the surgery room

738
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,400
But I know Guangxi trusts you

739
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,400
Don't worry

740
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,400
I won't be able to take you with me

741
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:55,400
I'll help Guangxi to be with him

742
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,400
I'll make him feel better

743
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,400
So I'll keep him in the surgery room

744
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,400
I'll take care of all the expenses

745
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,400
You can stay in the staff room

746
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,400
I'll take care of the rest

747
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,400
I'll take care of the rest

748
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,400
But I hope you can be a little less

749
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,400
Guangxi is a patient now, so I'll take care of him

750
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,400
You know what you're doing

751
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,400
I don't think you're qualified to be with Guangxi

752
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,400
I promise you

753
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,400
I promise you

754
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,400
I won't be a ticket

755
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,400
But I have the same goal as you

756
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,400
I want to live a healthy life

757
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:05,400
So I'll do anything to help him

758
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,400
To be honest, I don't like your way

759
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,400
But I know you really care about him

760
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,400
So I can understand you

761
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,400
Where are you going?

762
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,400
I've contacted the hospital

763
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:36,400
To enter the surgery room, I'll have a series of money check-ups

764
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,400
Miss Liang will be tired if you don't take the job

765
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,400
Miss Liang, go back and get ready

766
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,400
I'll take you to the hospital

767
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,400
Guangxi, I'll take Miss Liang with me

768
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,400
No need. You have to do the check-up

769
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,400
Have a good rest. I'll go to the hospital with you tomorrow

770
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,400
You must come

771
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,400
Bye

772
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,400
You're really in a bad mood today

773
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,400
Why did you call me so early in the morning?

774
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,400
I was looking for you

775
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,400
I went to the clinic last night

776
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,400
Have a look

777
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,400
The painkiller?

778
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:35,400
Yes. It's the latest technology for painkillers

779
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,400
The painkiller has this technology

780
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,400
They plan to open it next year

781
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,400
But He Dong and I have talked about it

782
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,400
He said he was very optimistic and strong

783
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,400
He wanted you to be the first victim

784
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,400
This is He Dong's investment technology

785
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:59,400
Please tell him I have a medical doctor

786
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,400
He'll help me

787
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,400
Thank you for your kind words

788
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,400
Guangxi, do you know how much the painkiller has

789
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,400
to you for this treatment?

790
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,400
Since you have such a good painkiller

791
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,400
Why can't you accept He Dong's help?

792
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,400
Do you have more painkillers?

793
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,400
First, it's the painkiller

794
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,400
Now, it's my head

795
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,400
I don't want He Dong to do this

796
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,400
He Dong's goal is to be with you

797
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,400
But you know it better than anything

798
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,400
I only like Mu Chen

799
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,400
So I don't want to owe him anything

800
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,400
I don't like to owe him anything

801
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:38,400
You can't be more familiar with this

802
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,400
You're so lucky to have this

803
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,400
You want to be the one to be the painkiller?

804
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:49,400
I'm not a painkiller

805
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,400
I'm not the one

806
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,400
If you want to sell yourself to live

807
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,400
You can't control it

808
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,400
It's just a day without meaning

809
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,400
I've received it

810
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,400
You and He Dong don't waste time

811
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,400
I've prepared myself

812
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,400
If Mu Chen is with me

813
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,400
I'll win this battle

814
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,400
I'm sorry

815
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,400
I'm sorry

816
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,400
I'm sorry

817
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,400
I'm sorry

818
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,400
I'm sorry

819
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,400
I'm sorry

820
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,400
I'm sorry

821
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,400
I'm sorry

822
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,400
I'm sorry

823
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,400
I'm sorry

824
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,400
I'm sorry

825
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,400
I'm sorry

826
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,400
I'm sorry

827
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,400
I'm sorry

828
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,400
Dad

829
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:05,400
I've always found happiness in my doors

830
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:09,400
You matter

831
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,400
This operation

832
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,400
I gave my greatest courage and power

833
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,400
Let me accompany him

834
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:22,400
To overcome this fried egg

835
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,400
I'm not afraid of you.

836
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,400
I'm not afraid of you.

837
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,400
I'm not afraid of you.

838
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,400
I'm not afraid of you.

839
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,400
I'm not afraid of you.

840
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,400
I'm not afraid of you.

841
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,400
I'm not afraid of you.

842
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,400
I'm not afraid of you.

843
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,400
I'm not afraid of you.

844
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,400
I'm not afraid of you.

845
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,400
I'm not afraid of you.

846
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,400
I'm not afraid of you.

847
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,400
I'm not afraid of you.

848
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,400
I'm not afraid of you.

849
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,400
I'm not afraid of you.

850
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,400
I'm not afraid of you.

851
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:33,400
The End

852
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,400
I'm ready.

853
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:43,400
The End

854
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:48,400
We will arrange a detailed examination for Mr. Ren in the next few days.

855
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,400
Including MRI, CT, and the ultrasound.

856
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,400
You are sure that the place of the tumor is deep.

857
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,400
And the possibility of the transfer of the IC pack.

858
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,400
In addition, we will do a more detailed examination.

859
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:03,400
With the level of the test brain flow to other nerves and damage.

860
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,400
The End

861
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,400
Do a little disinfection.

862
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,400
It's a little cold.

863
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,400
Why are we fighting?

864
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,400
It's a little painful.

865
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,400
Put your hands down.

866
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,400
Yes.

867
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,400
Come, take a deep breath.

868
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,400
Finally, let go.

869
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,400
Relax.

870
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,400
Don't grow up.

871
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,400
Relax.

872
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,400
Yes, relax a little.

873
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,400
Which one is over?

874
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,400
Which one is over?

875
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,400
I'm almost ready.

876
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,400
Okay.

877
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:54,400
The End

The End

881
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,400
Miss, the test needs about 8 hours.

882
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,400
And then the test brain needs to be taken.

883
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,400
If there is any problem, you can press the back of the screen to help us.

884
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,400
Okay, thank you.

885
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:19,400

The End

888
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,400
I'll take this.

889
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,400
The End

890
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,400

The End

902
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,080
I visited Miss Pru but my feelings have的人

903
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,360
I'm useless

904
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:21,960
Yesterday, I met Miss Pru

905
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:28,000
Honestly, it's decided

906
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:34,600
Bingo

907
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,600
Dorain,

908
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,000
what's so interesting about him?

909
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:41,640
Did he really say so?

910
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:48,400
Does he have to hear what is being said?

911
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,160
Or will he still follow his seeking?

912
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,200
I think

913
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,480
everythingesting would be equal

914
01:02:58,720 --> 01:02:59,100
if they終端

915
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,200
begin playing in the blij的暗場

916
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:02,640
to guard our 3rd floor.

917
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:03,480
It's okay.

918
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,280
I'll still do my best CHOI

919
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:22,380
I'm sorry for saying sorry part.

920
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,400
The first game of the year is the first game of the year.

921
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,400
The first game of the year is the first game of the year.

922
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,400
The first game of the year is the first game of the year.

923
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,400
The first game of the year is the first game of the year.

924
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,400

absolutely A Ruse.

970
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,400
In Gala,

971
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:26,780
there are many

972
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:28,780
Of course, I can do it.

973
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:31,200
I just need to see you.

974
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,960
I can't do this anymore.

975
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,880
Then, I'll show you.

976
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:38,120
Otherwise, it wouldn't have been easy this age.

977
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:42,180
You can understand it.

978
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:44,820
Have you heard of Vine Garden?

979
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:46,760
I have heard the history of this garden.

980
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,860
Go and wash it right here.

981
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:52,500
Just like this, only you canちがぞぶ

982
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:55,460
It doesn't have anything to do with it.

983
01:05:55,460 --> 01:06:00,460
I'm really stupid.

984
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:05,460
I can't even sleep well.

985
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:10,460
Come, have a seat.

986
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:14,460
I'd like to thank you for giving me this chance.

987
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:17,460
I'll have a good time.

988
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:22,460
But I've never had a good time.

989
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:24,460
You want to call me?

990
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:29,460
Is this right?

991
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:33,460
Don't forget.

992
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:34,460
Right.

993
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:43,460
Don't scare me.

994
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:24,460
I'm sorry.

995
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:30,460
I'm sorry.

996
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:54,460
I'm sorry.

997
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:24,460
I can't sleep.

998
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:26,460
I don't have a piano here.

999
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:29,460
So I'll play this for you.

1000
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:54,460
I'm sorry.

1001
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:24,460

1002
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:54,460
Mr.

1003
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:56,460
Mr.

1004
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:58,460
Mr.

1005
01:09:58,460 --> 01:09:59,460
Mr.

1006
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:01,460
Mr.

1007
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:03,460
Mr.

1008
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:05,460
What's going on?

1009
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:09,460
I'm fine. I just fell asleep.

1010
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:16,460
Thank you.

1011
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:24,460
Mr.

1012
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:26,460
Mr.

1013
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:28,460
Mr.

1014
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:30,460
Mr.

1015
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:33,460
Look, the life of a person is in our hands.

1016
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:36,460
Don't worry. Everything will be safe.

1017
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:39,460
Don't you forget that you're going to attend our wedding?

1018
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:41,460
I'm willing to.

1019
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:44,460
Tomorrow, we'll go to the date.

1020
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:47,460
No medicine, no checkup, and we won't go to the hospital.

1021
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:50,460
I think it's the last day of the meeting.

1022
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:52,460
So I want to cherish it.

1023
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:53,460
But it's useless.

1024
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:55,460
Our medical and other people's medical.

1025
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,460
We still have to fight.

1026
01:10:57,460 --> 01:11:00,460
Although time cannot be shortened,

1027
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:05,460
photography is a way to turn the moment into a eternal magic.

1028
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:07,460
I'll give you this.

1029
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:09,460
It's a lucky bracelet. No one can pay for it.

1030
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:12,460
We're ready.

1031
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:15,460
If tomorrow, Guangxi can enter the opening ceremony,

1032
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:17,460
everything will be in its place.

1033
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:20,460
Thank you, Yixian.

1034
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:22,460
What are you doing?

1035
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:24,460
The surgery can't be done by hand.

1036
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:27,460
Please take care of it for me.

1037
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:28,460
Okay.

1038
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:31,460
This is just a test for Guangxi.

1039
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:34,460
After he enters the surgery room and receives the anesthesia,

1040
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:37,460
we'll do the treatment for him.

1041
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:40,460
I've never had a sedative patient

1042
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:43,460
in order to give him an operation to save his own life.

1043
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:45,460
Guangxi!

1044
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:46,460
Yixian, what's wrong?

1045
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:48,460
Things don't look good.

1046
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:50,460
I'm sorry to say it's very serious.

1047
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:15,460
I'm so sorry.

1048

I'm sorry.

1063
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:47,460
I'm sorry.

1064
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:49,460
I'm sorry.

1065
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:51,460
I'm sorry.

1066
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:53,460
I'm sorry.

1067
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:55,460
I'm sorry.

1068
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:57,460
I'm sorry.

1069
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:59,460
I'm sorry.

1070
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:01,460
I'm sorry.

1071
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,460
I'm sorry.

1072
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:05,460
I'm sorry.

1073
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:07,460
I'm sorry.

1074
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:09,460
I'm sorry.

1075
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:11,460
I'm sorry.
