1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Next, I'll broadcast for you right away.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,500
Next time, happy.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,500
Wait a minute!

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,500
This is for you to treat me.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,500
I'll take you to a good運.

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,500
I'm Huatouye. Where are you?

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,500
Liang Hucheng.

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,500
Thank you.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,500
The person...

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,500
really disappeared from your life?

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,500
Don't ask me to give up on you.

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,500
Because...

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
I don't know how to give up.

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,500
Because I'll always be the one who likes you.

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,500
Give me a chance.

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,500
Let me...

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
leave you to me.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I've decided to marry Mu Chen.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Are you done?

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You're going to hit me!

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Huatouye!

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Mu Chen! Don't do anything to me!

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Stop! He doesn't care what you do!

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
He can't even teach him a lesson!

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Mu Chen!

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You're a married woman.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So...

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
you're willing to give up?

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Please let me be by your side.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'll do whatever I can.

31
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,500
Please let me be the one who likes you.

32
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,500
I'll support you.

33
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,500
I'll take care of you and Xiaolan.

34
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,500
Your family.

35
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Okay?

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The Yellow Hall

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Episode 19

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Huatouye, you can go in.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,500
Huatouye,

40
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,500
come here and print.

41
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,500
Huatouye,

42
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,500
I'll come here and print.

43
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,500
I'll come here and print.

44
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,500
Huatouye,

45
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,500
come here and print.

46
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Come on.

47
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,000
It's weird.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,500
Why does the police say that

49
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,500
the search for our house is just a misunderstanding?

50
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,500
The police won't let us go so easily.

51
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,500
What did you do?

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Did you cut the wind?

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You're so stupid.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You're kidding me.

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You're not funny.

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Let's go.

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm not going to cook.

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You can't eat noodles.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm hungry.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm hungry.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You're going to be angry this morning.

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Don't play with me.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He forced you, didn't he?

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I want to give Xiaolue a house.

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
After all, he's Xiaole's biological father.

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And I tried hard to make up for this relationship

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Maybe I should give him a chance

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What chance?

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Is he with Xiao Le?

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Or you and him?

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I didn't think too much

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I just want to walk one step, count one step

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You're so good at thinking

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You're fine now

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You won't be locked up

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Xiao Le has a father too

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The only bad thing is

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
He doesn't love me

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So...

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:28,000
He did this for you that day, right?

81
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You're so good at thinking

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Don't sacrifice yourself

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I've been a single mother for so many years

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I've been raising Xiao Le

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
From now on, I don't need to worry about him

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm not afraid of him fighting with me

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I don't need to say anything bad about him

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So you should be happy for me

89
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What about you?

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Are you happy?

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm happy, but not important

92
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What's important is

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You don't need to worry about me

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
This decision

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I thought about it before I made it

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You're killing me

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You promised me

98
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
What's the matter with you today?

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm sorry

100
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Can you stop saying sorry?

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Can you stop thinking about others?

102
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Don't ask me or Xiao Le

103
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Can you think about your life in the first place?

104
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Why?

105
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You promised me

106
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You're still with someone to take away

107
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Why?

108
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I knew you

109
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But six years ago, six years later

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You still chose to sign the contract

111
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You still chose to sign the contract

112
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You know what?

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm the one who's been crying the most

114
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Not you and her

115
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm the one who's been crying the most

116
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You never believed me from the start

117
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Every time we meet in trouble

118
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I always think of that person

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Not me

120
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm so stupid, right?

121
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So naive

122
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I thought

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You're the only one who's not with her

124
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That person

125
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
He'll see

126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
He'll understand

127
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But I think I'm wrong

128
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
We're all filled with you

129
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But we're all filled with you

130
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
We're all filled with you

131
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You're afraid of everything

132
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Maybe I'll be in trouble

133
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Go

134
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Go to be a husband to your family

135
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's good for Xiao Le

136
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I have a rich father

137
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's better than being with me

138
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
To live a hard life

139
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm not that bad

140
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I should

141
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But no one wants to

142
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
There's nothing

143
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's just separation

144
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's different from six years ago

145
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Because

146
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I can't

147
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Be friends again

148
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Don't mind me

149
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Why do you

150
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Have to be my ideal man?

151
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's OK

152
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's just six years

153
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'll

154
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Be so stupid

155
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
OK

156
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'll go now

157
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Goodbye

158
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'll go now

159
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Tuoyuan

160
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
No matter what you think

161
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
In my heart

162
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'll always

163
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Always remember me

164
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I hate you

165
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I can only find out now

166
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I hate you the most

167
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's just how you are

168
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I let you blush

169
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But you still smile

170
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I thought you were

171
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Who you were

172
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I thought I was strong enough

173
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
But I was so desperate

174
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Give me a little hope

175
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm not that bad

176
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm not that bad

177
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I know

178
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'll help you deal with the data of Liu Wancai

179
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Boss

180
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Are you sure you want to do this?

181
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
As long as you'll pay for the fine

182
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I won't take the case of Liu Wancai

183
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But he's a very good match

184
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Money is not the point

185
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Boss

186
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm not that bad

187
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Boss

188
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
A new ring

189
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It suits you

190
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's a wedding ring

191
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Congratulations on your marriage

192
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm not married to him

193
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Don't joke with me

194
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Who doesn't know you're the only one who loves a lady in the past six years?

195
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Do you want to see my friend on the 3rd floor?

196
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
No, I don't

197
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I don't care who you marry

198
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Happy new year

199
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Please help me buy the tycoon ring

200
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'll give it to you later

201
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Sorry

202
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You just want me to order the tycoon ring

203
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'll give it to my son

204
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Actually, the wedding is not bad

205
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The most popular wedding is the child in the belly

206
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You've seen this for a long time

207
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
When will the fortune tell you?

208
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
My son is five years old

209
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'll go to work for you

210
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Don't ask anymore

211
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm not going to work for you

212
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm not going to work for you

213
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm not going to work for you

214
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm not going to work for you

215
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm not going to work for you

216
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm not going to work for you

217
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm not going to work for you

218
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm not going to work for you

219
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm not going to work for you

220
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm not going to work for you

221
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm not going to work for you

222
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm not going to work for you

223
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm not going to work for you

224
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm not going to work for you

225
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm not going to work for you

226
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm not going to work for you

227
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm not going to work for you

228
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm not going to work for you

229
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm not going to work for you

230
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm not going to work for you

231
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm not going to work for you

232
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'm not going to work for you

233
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm not going to work for you

234
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm not going to work for you

235
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm not going to work for you

236
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm not going to work for you

237
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm not going to work for you

238
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm not going to work for you

239
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm not going to work for you

240
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm not going to work for you

241
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm not going to work for you

242
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm not going to work for you

243
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm not going to work for you

244
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm not going to work for you

245
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm not going to work for you

246
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm not going to work for you

247
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm not going to work for you

248
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm not going to work for you

249
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm not going to work for you

250
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm not going to work for you

251
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm not going to work for you

252
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm not going to work for you

253
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm not going to work for you

254
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm not going to work for you

255
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's here

256
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It's here

257
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It's here

258
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's really big

259
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You can't be a car

260
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Can't be a car. Have you been waiting long?

261
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I haven't

262
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm just used to it

263
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's so much stuff

264
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
There's lot more than the ones in flower fields

265
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Thank you

266
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You're welcome

267
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Xiao Le was waiting for the door

268
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
So I took her out to have a look

269
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'll go back to work

270
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Mu Chen

271
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Mu Chen, you've been holding me

272
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Because Mu Chen is holding Xiao Le

273
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I feel like

274
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
There's nothing to be afraid of

275
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
But this is his home

276
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You're so embarrassed

277
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Xiao Le

278
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
This is our home from now on

279
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Really?

280
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
This is so big

281
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Mu Chen, you've seen my room

282
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Mu Chen, let's go to the room

283
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Mu Chen, look

284
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
This is my room

285
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
My mom said this is my room

286
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I thought I'd stay here all day

287
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I didn't expect this room to be mine

288
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I want to play with my mom

289
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Xiao Le, you can't do that

290
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
We live in this house

291
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's far from the hall

292
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
If you let her come

293
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
She'll be like you in the morning

294
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
She'll be in the car for a long time

295
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Long time

296
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
After I graduate

297
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I won't go to the hall

298
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'll go to the first place to study

299
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And

300
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You can't be in the study again

301
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
You have to transfer

302
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Then what?

303
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You'll meet many new friends

304
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
But Tantang won't come

305
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Then what?

306
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
They'll stay in Huatian幼稚園

307
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Then where is Dora?

308
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Dora

309
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
They'll stay in Huatian Village

310
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Only Xiao Le and Mu Chen

311
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Will move to the house with Guangxi's dad

312
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Xiao Le

313
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
If you don't want to tell Mu Chen

314
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'm not unhappy

315
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I want to live with dad

316
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
But Dora didn't come

317
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
We can't bear to do that

318
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Mu Chen knows

319
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Mu Chen also misses them

320
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Xiao Le, have a seat

321
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I want to have a meal with you

322
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Okay, I'll take a seat

323
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Don't come in

324
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
If you don't like it

325
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You can have dinner later

326
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Let me do it today

327
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Xiao Le was having beef rice with me

328
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And Guangxi likes to eat it

329
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Okay

330
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Xiao Le, Mu Chen

331
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Do you remember who went to the hospital

332
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
When you were injured in Taipei?

333
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I remember, your grandma

334
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
She's not your grandma

335
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
She's dad's mom

336
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You have to call her grandma

337
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
She didn't recognize you that time

338
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
So I don't know you

339
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But she'll be back today

340
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Do you know what she's going to call you?

341
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Grandma

342
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Come, let's go to the doctor

343
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Don't touch me

344
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Come, let's go to the hospital

345
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Don't touch me

346
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
The End

347
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Xiao Le, let's eat first.

348
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
No, I want to eat with dad. I want to eat with dad.

349
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:43,000
If dad comes back, he might be angry and won't eat with dad.

350
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Be good. You can eat with dad anytime.

351
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'll make you some.

352
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I want to make a carrot.

353
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
This is made for you and dad.

354
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
So I won't make a carrot today.

355
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
But only today.

356
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Madam.

357
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
President Fang.

358
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Grandma, I want to be with dad. I can't tell you.

359
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm not your grandma.

360
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
But I want to tell you...

361
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You're a rude kid.

362
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You can't tell me.

363
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I want to be your grandson.

364
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'll let you know when you're done.

365
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Grandma, I want to be your grandson.

366
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Grandma.

367
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I want to be your grandson.

368
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I want to be your grandson.

369
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Grandma.

370
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Grandma.

371
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,500
Uncle Feng

372
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,000
No polite child

373
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,500
Hands and feet

374
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,000
Want to be my grandson

375
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,500
Wait for you to teach him the rules

376
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,500
Sorry

377
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,500
I thought Guangxi was just talking

378
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,500
Can't imagine he's real

379
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,500
Zhang Ma

380
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
Get me ready to get on the bus

381
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,500
I'm already in a bad mood

382
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,000
to have a girl without parents

383
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,500
to be my daughter-in-law

384
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
Now a kid is still in front of me

385
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,500
No home

386
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,500
Can I just stay here?

387
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,500
Grandma

388
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,500
Grandma

389
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,500
Grandma, today

390
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,500
Because of Xiaolei

391
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,500
I'm feeling a little bit better

392
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,500
Do you know?

393
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,500
Do you remember

394
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,500
Last time you attended the幼稚園 sports event

395
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
You were so tired and sleepy when you were filming

396
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,500
No one talked to you about me

397
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,500
Just wanted to go to bed

398
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,500
Grandma

399
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,500
It was like this just now

400
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,500
So just now

401
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,500
Grandma will be on the bus

402
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,500
You go and buy your dinner now

403
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,500
I'll get you some food

404
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,500
Grandma will get it for you

405
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,500
Xiaolei is the best

406
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,500
Go

407
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,500
The End

408
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,500
This is the list of the guests

409
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,500
And the schedule

410
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,500
Please confirm it

411
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:26,500
The End

412
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,500
Grandma

413
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,500
I've moved the luggage on the bus

414
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,500
The photo you have

415
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,500
Is the image you made

416
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,500
That kid

417
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,500
Is the reality you should face

418
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,500
What do you want to say?

419
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,500
I want to ask you

420
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,500
If your life can be re-established

421
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,500
Will you keep hiding

422
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,500
What happened to your father in Guangxi

423
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,500
After that

424
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,500
Will you keep repeating

425
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,500
His life when you lose your memory in Guangxi

426
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,500
Of course

427
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,500
No matter how many times I repeat

428
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,500
My mistakes are the same

429
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,500
What did you get

430
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,500
The same happiness as you expected

431
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,500
in your life in Guangxi

432
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,500
I never felt wrong

433
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,500
I felt I was not good enough

434
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,500
I couldn't let Guangxi

435
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,500
Have a better life

436
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,500
This is the failure I've been making up

437
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,500
And I keep making up

438
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,500
I think

439
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,500
The company of Guangxi

440
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,500
Is the right life

441
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,500
For her

442
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,500
This is the life of Guangxi

443
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,500
And the path she should take

444
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,500
The more you want to take care of her life

445
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,500
The more she wants to get rid of you

446
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,500
Six years have passed

447
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,500
All things have returned to the original

448
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,500
I'm thinking

449
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,500
If you let Guangxi

450
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,500
Understand the truth of her father's suicide

451
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,500
I think your mother

452
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,500
Absolutely impossible

453
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,500
Enough

454
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,500
I will never regret

455
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,500
The things I've done

456
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,500
De Rong

457
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,500
This child

458
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,500
I'm like a kid in a game

459
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,500
A pure and sincere life

460
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,500
If you're willing

461
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,500
You can start from the beginning

462
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,500
How to learn to treat your family

463
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,500
I'm not afraid of you

464
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,500
I'm not afraid of you

465
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,500
I'm not afraid of you

466
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,500
I'm not afraid of you

467
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,500
I'm not afraid of you

468
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,500
I'm not afraid of you

469
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,500
I'm not afraid of you

470
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,500
I'm not afraid of you

471
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,500
I'm not afraid of you

472
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,500
I'm not afraid of you

473
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,500
I'm not afraid of you

474
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,500
Are you off work?

475
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,500
Call the reporter

476
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,500
They said Li Wangcai

477
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,500
The case of the employee and the criminal

478
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
All the girls are killed

479
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,500
You're lying

480
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,500
I don't want money

481
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,500
You don't deserve to be a lawyer

482
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,500
You really don't deserve to be a person

483
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,500
How is she?

484
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,500
She's still in the hospital

485
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,500
The police are investigating the cause of the suicide

486
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,500
It's possible that this case

487
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,500
Is related to her second trial

488
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,500
The reporter wants to hear your opinion

489
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,500
I've already talked to Li Wangcai

490
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,500
Don't talk to him

491
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,500
Call the police

492
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,500
Boss

493
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,500
The wedding is not necessary

494
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,500
It's so late

495
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,500
Someone else should be waiting for you

496
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,500
You should go back soon

497
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,500
製作 心環走 go

498
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:48,860
生命中心

499
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,500
Angel andElyse

500
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,500
inexpensive

501
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,500
A large box and a lot of clothes

502
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,500
It's too small

503
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,500
so dangerous

504
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,500
He almost died several times

505
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:13,500
Xia Xia's uncle has been in a cold sweat

506
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,500
He asked me without any hesitation

507
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,500
My stomach is so tired

508
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,500
Can I eat a big bowl now?

509
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,500
But Uncle Hao said carefully

510
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,500
I can't do it now

511
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,500
I have to wait until I can eat

512
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,500
Let me endure it for a while

513
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,500
A secret

514
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,500
It's wonderful

515
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,500
It's so delicious.

516
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,500
Do you miss me?

517
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,500
Are you tired from work?

518
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,500
I'm fine.

519
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,500
Have you eaten? I made beef rice.

520
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,500
I've eaten.

521
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,500
I'm hungry.

522
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,500
Are you awake?

523
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,500
Yes.

524
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,500
Why didn't you change your clothes?

525
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,500
Where's your luggage?

526
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,500
In the living room.

527
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,500
How is it? Are you going to sleep in the living room?

528
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,500
I can't get in. I'm going to live in a room.

529
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,500
Are you kidding me?

530
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,500
Which room should I sleep in?

531
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,500
Of course, I'm going to sleep in our room.

532
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:47,500
Don't think this is a fake marriage.

533
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:53,500
As long as your identity is in the back, I'll be the one to name it.

534
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,500
Just do it for me.

535
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,500
Please.

536
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,500
Come out with me.

537
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,500
I want to see a newlywed room.

538
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,500
I'm going to see a newlywed room.

539
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,500
If you leave your hand in the fridge,

540
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,500
it means you leave your life to him.

541
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,500
I said I'd sign it.

542
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,500
It means I'll protect you.

543
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,500
But I won't.

544
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,500
As long as I stay here, I'll protect you.

545
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,500
I'll protect you.

546
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,500
I'll protect you.

547
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:01,500
The End

548
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,500
What are you doing?

549
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,500
What are you doing?

550
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,500
Can you see clearly?

551
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,500
This is your last experience for me.

552
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,500
I really don't know.

553
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,500
I'm sorry.

554
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,500
It's useless.

555
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,500
It's hurt.

556
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,500
It's hurt.

557
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:06,500
You said this, didn't you?

558
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,500
Why are you so scared?

559
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,500
We just got married.

560
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,500
You should celebrate it.

561
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,500
I'll go to bed after the shoot tonight.

562
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,500
You look familiar.

563
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,500
You were like this before.

564
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,500
We only had a little time.

565
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,500
Don't pretend to be clear in front of me.

566
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,500
My memories are back.

567
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,500
Including the night scene.

568
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,500
Including the night scene.

569
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,500
Don't be so serious.

570
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,500
What are you looking at?

571
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,500
We've already got married.

572
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,500
We're married.

573
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,500
Next.

574
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,500
What should you do next?

575
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,500
too early

576
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,500
Miss You

577
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,500
Episode 3

578
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,500
You don't even want to act.

579
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,500
I suggest you to let go of Ming Tian.

580
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,200
If I hang up, these are all yours.

581
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,100
You don't need to give me anymore.

582
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,100
I'll understand.

583
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,600
Other than letting you leave Huatui,

584
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,900
these things are all beneficial to you.

585
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,700
I don't know why you're crying.

586
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,800
But because I'm not Huatui,

587
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,800
that's why you feel very painful.

588
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,800
Wei Ying.

589
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,400
You won't be like this.

590
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,800
I'm not Huatui.

591
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,800
I'm not Huatui.

592
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,800
I'm not Huatui.

593
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,800
I'm not Huatui.

594
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,800
I'm not Huatui.

595
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,800
I'm not Huatui.

596
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,800
I'm not Huatui.

597
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,800
I'm not Huatui.

598
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,800
I'm not Huatui.

599
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,800
I'm not Huatui.

600
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,800
I'm not Huatui.

601
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,800
I'm not Huatui.

602
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,800
I'm not Huatui.

603
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,800
I'm not Huatui.

604
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,800
I'm not Huatui.

605
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,800
Duai.

606
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,800
Duai.

607
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,800
Are you okay?

608
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,800
Ding, you come here.

609
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,800
Come.

610
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,800
Come with me.

611
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,800
Come here.

612
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,800
Finally, come with me.

613
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,800
Duai, wait.

614
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,800
Duai, wait.

615
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,800
Duai.

616
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,800
Duai, how are you feeling now?

617
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,800
I'm feeling better.

618
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,800
I'm not feeling well.

619
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,800
How are you feeling?

620
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,800
I'm feeling better.

621
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,800
Min,

622
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,800
if you don't go to Taipei to do something,

623
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,800
you'll go to the market to buy the food.

624
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,800
You...

625
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,800
You said you don't want to buy the food.

626
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,800
What should I tell you?

627
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,800
No, I'm just saying.

628
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,800
I'll buy the food.

629
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,800
I'll buy the food.

630
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,800
You...

631
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,800
I'm not afraid of you.

632
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,800
You're looking at me like this.

633
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,800
You can't stand it.

634
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,800
I'll use my grandma's method to solve it.

635
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,800
Okay, relax.

636
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,800
Duai.

637
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,800
Duai.

638
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,800
Do you have a job?

639
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,800
What?

640
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,800
No. I have university students to talk to.

641
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,800
They want to talk about

642
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,800
the true meaning of wine and flowers.

643
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,800
But I know you're the most contentious in both aspects.

644
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,800
So, you want to let us

645
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,800
meet each other?

646
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,800
Yes.

647
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,800
When did you get so sad?

648
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,800
I haven't heard that you have university students.

649
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,800
Do you have any contact with them?

650
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,800
Yes.

651
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,800
Duai, I have a lot of things to do.

652
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,800
You don't know them.

653
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,800
Okay?

654
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,800
Let's go.

655
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,800
Let's go.

656
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,800
Let's go.

657
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,800
I know you're not as good as me.

658
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,800
You're right.

659
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,800
I've been drinking for a long time.

660
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,800
I've been drinking for a long time.

661
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,800
I'll be back.

662
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,800
0982 972 144.

663
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,800
Meigui, pick up the phone.

664
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,800
Why aren't you picking up?

665
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,800
Duai, hurry up.

666
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,800
Hurry up.

667
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,800
What are you doing?

668
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,800
Meigui, pick up the phone.

669
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,800
You finally pick up the phone.

670
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,800
Meigui, my friend has arrived.

671
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,800
He's here?

672
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,800
Yes.

673
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,800
Wait a minute.

674
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,800
The legendary flower world.

675
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,800
Sing and sing, eat and watch a movie.

676
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,800
Meigui 0989,

677
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,800
Meigui 0926.

678
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,800
Wait for you.

679
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,800
What are you doing?

680
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,800
Duai, have you heard of the society university?

681
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,800
This man graduated from society.

682
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,800
Where did you get the real deal?

683
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,800
You're killing me.

684
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,800
I found this legendary girl.

685
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,800
She's like a rose.

686
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,800
When you drink alcohol and have a hot drink,

687
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,800
you can make them feel the real love.

688
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,800
Duai, don't be angry.

689
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,800
I just want you to be happy.

690
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,800
If you don't like it,

691
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,800
forget it.

692
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,800
Meigui, let me tell you.

693
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,800
Hello, are you Meigui?

694
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,800
Do you have a knot here?

695
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,800
Of course.

696
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,800
I'll call him anytime.

697
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,800
I can come here for anything.

698
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,800
I don't need a knot.

699
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,800
The knot is quite straight.

700
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,800
The jade is your dish.

701
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,800
So cute.

702
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,800
Will Man Tianxing come?

703
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,800
Let me call him.

704
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,800
What's wrong with your face?

705
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,800
Are you happy?

706
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,800
I used to watch a tree

707
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,800
because I was so focused.

708
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,800
I gave up on the whole life.

709
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,800
I can't do it now.

710
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,800
Let's go.

711
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,800
Be happy.

712
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,800
We'll enjoy the life together.

713
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,800
What do you think?

714
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,800
Smile.

715
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,800
Don't give me that!

716
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,800
What are you doing?

717
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,800
You're so annoying.

718
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,800
I'm sorry.

719
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,800
You're so annoying.

720
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,800
Let's go.

721
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,800
Meigui is coming.

722
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,800
Xiaoya.

723
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,800
What's wrong?

724
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,800
Nothing.

725
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,800
We're just family.

726
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,800
We just want to go.

727
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,800
We can go to school.

728
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,800
Let's go.

729
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,800
Let's go.

730
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,800
Let's go.

731
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,800
We're not done yet.

732
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,800
Let's go.

733
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,800
Brother Fang, I'll go to the library.

734
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,800
I'll go to the library.

735
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,800
Master.

736
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,800
I'm sorry to have upset you.

737
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,800
Don't use this time to be like this.

738
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,800
You're so stubborn.

739
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,800
I'm not stubborn.

740
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,800
You're stubborn.

741
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,800
You're stubborn.

742
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,800
You're stubborn.

743
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,800
You're stubborn.

744
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,800
You're stubborn.

745
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,800
You're stubborn.

746
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,800
You're stubborn.

747
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,800
You're stubborn.

748
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,800
Look at you.

749
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,800
You're a bad girl.

750
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,800
What are you doing?

751
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,800
What are you doing?

752
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,800
You're so stubborn.

753
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,800
I'm so stubborn.

754
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:52,800
What are you doing?

755
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,800
You're stubborn.

756
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,800
No.

757
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,800
No.

758
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,800
I'm stubborn.

759
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,800
You're stubborn.

760
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,800
You're stubborn.

761
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,800
Get out of the way.

762
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,800
Get out of the way.

763
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,800
No.

764
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,800
Get out.

765
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,800
Get out.

766
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,800
No.

767
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,800
No.

768
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,800
No.

769
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,800
No.

770
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,800
No.

771
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,800
Why are you sleeping here?

772
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,800
Your phone isn't on, and you can't find anyone at home.

773
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,800
You didn't know I was in the morning.

774
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,800
What's the matter?

775
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,800
Today's newspaper is your news.

776
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,800
The Chinese press has signed a marriage proposal.

777
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,800
The famous lawyer, Ren Guangxi,

778
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,800
has been in the police station since the last time he got married.

779
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,800
He was in the police station the other day.

780
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,800
He was in the police station the other day.

781
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,800
He was in the police station the other day.

782
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,800
After the marriage, he was in the police station again.

783
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,800
He was the ex-convict,

784
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,800
the former president of the police station, Li Wangcai.

785
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,800
The ex-convict is not satisfied with the decision.

786
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,800
He will sleep.

787
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,800
According to the news,

788
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,800
the police found Li Suhan's diary

789
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,800
in the house of Li Wangcai.

790
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,800
There are many bad news about you.

791
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,800
You and Li Wangcai were arrested.

792
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,800
The key evidence is Li Wangcai's missing.

793
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,800
He threatened me with a light stick.

794
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,800
He really did.

795
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,800
Is it a lie?

796
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,800
Or a lie?

797
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,800
Or a lie?

798
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,800
I don't know.

799
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:05,800
You don't know?

800
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,800
You don't even know whether you are a light stick.

801
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,800
You even made a video of me taking a photo of the camera.

802
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:10,800
You didn't even have a finger.

803
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,800
It's just a piece of cake.

804
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,800
The End

805
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,800
Dad hasn't come back yet.

806
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,800
Why don't you come to the hospital?

807
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:40,800
Maybe.

808
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:41,800
But don't worry.

809
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,800
Today is the first day of the school transfer.

810
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,800
I think Dad will be back soon.

811
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,800
He will take you to class.

812
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,800
But let's finish this first, okay?

813
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,800
Let's put on the belly.

814
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:14,800
Grandma.

815
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:18,800
Come in.

816
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,800
Come in.

817
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,800
I have a dinner for you.

818
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,800
Didn't I tell you yesterday?

819
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,800
I'm not your grandma.

820
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,800
Don't call me that.

821
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,800
Yes, you are my grandma.

822
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,800
Where is Guan Xichen?

823
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,800
What's going on in the newspaper?

824
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,800
Ren Guangxi is under control of the key evidence.

825
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,800
He is a light stick.

826
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,800
What's going on?

827
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,800
You don't know about this?

828
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,800
Aren't you married?

829
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,800
What?

830
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,800
Guan Xichen doesn't even tell you about this?

831
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,800
Because he doesn't need to know.

832
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,800
Yes, you two have a fight today.

833
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,800
Wenqi, come here.

834
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,800
Okay.

835
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:32,800
Don't be like that.

836
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,800
I'm like this.

837
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,800
Dad, what are you doing?

838
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,800
Hey,缩到筋、缩到她,

839
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,800
What?

840
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,800
You don't even tell me about this?

841
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,800
Because he doesn't need to know.

842
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,800
Daddy is here!

843
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,800
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

844
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,800
You go to the clinic first. I'll take you to the doctor.

845
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,800
I'll go first.

846
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,800
You're so mad.

847
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,800
You're with him all the time.

848
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,800
What?

849
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,800
You stayed at the company all night and didn't go home?

850
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,800
I really don't know what you're doing with this wedding.

851
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:30,800
Look.

852
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,800
The newspaper is so big. How are you going to deal with it?

853
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,800
I've already written down the name of the reporter.

854
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,800
The newspaper is not true.

855
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,800
I can tell him back.

856
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,800
Truth is not important at all.

857
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,800
The most important thing is that this matter has already caused harm to your career and professional image.

858
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,800
I can't do anything about it.

859
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,800
I'm familiar with the editor of this newspaper.

860
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,800
You can put your time down.

861
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,800
I've already made an appointment with you.

862
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,800
I'll ask him to write a comment and report it.

863
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:05,800
I'll use all the people in the news to reduce the damage to this matter.

864
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,800
You never care about the truth.

865
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,800
You always think you can rely on your own means to deal with things.

866
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,800
Six years ago, you just wanted to deal with my life.

867
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:21,800
Six years later, you haven't changed at all.

868
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:25,800
I tell you, I really hate such a means.

869
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,800
You said it was for my own good.

870
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,800
In fact, the most selfish person is...

871
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,800
Kong Xi, don't talk to President Fang.

872
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,800
President, I'm sorry.

873
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,800
Kong Xi is in a bad mood, so that's why he said that.

874
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:41,800
Don't blame him.

875
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,800
I know my son's personality better than anyone else.

876
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,800
I don't need you to explain it to him.

877
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:51,800
Kong Xi, if you don't deal with this matter well,

878
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,800
your hard-earned career will be ruined.

879
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,800
Think about it carefully.

880
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,800
Call me if you want to.

881
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,800
Don't talk to him.

882
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,800
I'll be happy if you talk to him.

883
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,800
Teacher, I just told you to take your step.

884
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,800
Sorry to trouble you.

885
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:38,800
Little Le!

886
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,800
Mom has already given the water to Teacher.

887
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,800
I forgot about it.

888
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,800
You have to remind her yourself.

889
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,800
Good boy.

890
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,800
Little Le, you're a good boy.

891
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,500
Not only is she not afraid of pain, she is always happy.

892
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:59,100
It must be because of her parents' love for her.

893
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:02,300
That's why you are so happy, right?

894
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:05,600
Because I have a warm family, I will raise a warm Xiao Le.

895
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,900
I and my wife will always be together.

896
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:11,000
Today is Xiao Le's first day of class.

897
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,100
Mom and Dad can take her to a new environment first.

898
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:17,000
We still have the class in the afternoon. I'll go get the materials first.

899
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,700
Thank you.

900
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,900
Xiao Le, let's go.

901
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,300
Xiao Le, let's go.

902
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,200
I know you don't like me to control you.

903
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,900
But in the future, you will be able to cooperate with me.

904
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,700
If you don't want to forget, I will be your teacher.

905
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,200
Xiao Le, let's go.

906
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,200
This is my toy.

907
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,200
Hurry up. Xiao Le.

908
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:04,700
What's wrong?

909
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,900
Did you get hurt?

910
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:09,300
Eric, how are you feeling?

911
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:13,900
It's okay for the child to play again.

912
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:16,000
It hurts.

913
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,600
Madam, you are a good teacher. You are a child.

914
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,500
My child needs special care.

915
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,700
Your attitude will be hurtful if you do this.

916
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:29,100
Eric, did Mom teach you to go to the hospital?

917
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:31,400
It's called a medical care.

918
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,900
That's what Uncle said.

919
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:36,500
So, their little friends will not go to the hospital.

920
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,500
Don't play with their little friends in the future.

921
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:44,500
Mo Chen, take Xiao Le to the hospital first.

922
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:56,500
Madam, you know I am a lawyer.

923
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,000
Then I will tell you.

924
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,600
You just said that I am not guilty.

925
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:03,900
It's best to be in the hospital for two years.

926
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,500
I am not afraid of people like you.

927
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,500
Eric, let's go.

928
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,300
Xiao Le has gone to class.

929
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:32,800
Guang Xi, if you want to talk about the thing with me about the newspaper.

930
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,200
Let's talk about it.

931
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,000
You are too mean.

932
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,600
Xiao Le is no longer here.

933
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,600
You don't need to pretend to be a good wife.

934
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,800
Then you can pretend that I am acting.

935
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,700
I just hope that you don't get sick of the things that happened just now

936
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:48,400
because of the work.

937
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,900
How could I?

938
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,200
But I will let her know that I am growing up.

939
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,900
That's her father's job.

940
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:59,000
I don't need to care about my life and personality.

941
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,100
I just need to care about her as my client and serve her.

942
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:05,600
I just need to be responsible for her.

943
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,900
I don't need to care about other things.

944
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:12,500
I don't need to care about Xiao Le's stupid classmates.

945
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:15,100
As long as I am still a lawyer of Li Wang Cai,

946
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:18,200
I won't change my position on this case.

947
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,300
Then what about Guang Xi?

948
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,000
Maybe I don't know the lawyer.

949
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,500
But I know Guang Xi.

950
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:29,900
I also remember that when he was in Huatian Village,

951
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:33,500
he talked to me about the feeling of this case.

952
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:37,900
So I know that he is not the kind of person who doesn't know how to write.

953
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,800
😁

954
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
You really care about me

955
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
But it's a pity

956
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I won't find you again

957
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
I have to go back to the dorm

958
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
You can go back by yourself

959
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Love

960
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Jin

961
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Yu

962
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Jian

963
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Hero

964
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
What else?

965
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Some women's groups also said they would be loved by the public

966
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,000
They think Wu Li Hua has already proposed the proof and DNA comparison

967
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
All kinds of evidence proves that he was framed

968
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
But you are not the one who is the one who forced him to go

969
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Because you are a scumbag who doesn't respect you

970
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
I don't respect you?

971
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Then I can also tell them not to respect my human rights

972
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Have they ever learned how to be a criminal?

973
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Before the court has even decided, they were all bought

974
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
They have no reason to be a criminal

975
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
I also insist on believing that I was a criminal

976
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
And that I would help him to get the most powerful judge

977
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
This is a most recent professional

978
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
What is this?

979
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Hello, Cai Yuan

980
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
What?

981
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Okay, I will tell him

982
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Boss, Cai Yuan just came to ask for the permission to be the judge

983
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
He even asked for the permission to be the judge

984
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
The reason is because of your image now

985
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
You don't match his conscience and his professional requirements

986
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
What conscience?

987
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Last time he hid his wife and asked me to go to the hotel

988
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
This guy is more than me

989
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
He is a criminal

990
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
He is a criminal

991
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
He is a criminal

992
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
This guy is more than me

993
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
How dare you to make me pay for this?

994
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
You can even close your eyes

995
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Boss, you should pick up the phone yourself

996
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
It's Li Wangcai

997
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Hello

998
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Mr. Li, I only heard your voice

999
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I knew you were so annoying

1000
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
We are really the same age

1001
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
The judge said we were right

1002
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
These people still don't let us off

1003
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Please don't mention me again

1004
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
We are the same age

1005
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
We are the same age

1006
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
It's none of your business

1007
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I don't know how to pay for your house

1008
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
But I don't have a soul

1009
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,000
How can you say that you are as fast as a criminal?

1010
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Okay

1011
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I called to warn you

1012
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
The photo of the thief was in your hand

1013
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
You will regret it

1014
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
I don't know what you are talking about

1015
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
You asked me to hand over the photo to you

1016
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,000
You asked me to hand over the photo to you

1017
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,000
My lawyer told me to warn you

1018
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
This is proof that I am guilty

1019
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
If you dare to make him pay for this

1020
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
I will turn the lawyer's case against you

1021
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
You will be useless in the lawyer world

1022
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
You will be in trouble if you are in the court

1023
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
I know better than you that you are a lawyer

1024
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
You don't have to remind me

1025
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,000
You should have thought of a way to make up for your suicide

1026
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
You are still lying in the hospital

1027
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Why should I spend money on such a dead-end girl?

1028
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
I am in trouble

1029
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I have invested a lot of money on you

1030
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I have made up for your beauty selection

1031
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
I am busy now

1032
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
I am busy with the analysis

1033
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Ren-ni, I will introduce you to some beauties

1034
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I will let you think about it

1035
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Shut up

1036
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
This is the biggest sin in my life

1037
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I love him

1038
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,000
I am in love with him

1039
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I am in love with him

1040
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
I will never forget

1041
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Hello

1042
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Are you Ren Guangxi?

1043
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
We are from the iPhone magazine

1044
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
We are trying to kill Miss Wuli Hua

1045
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
She is not here

1046
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Miss Wuli Hua is still in the hospital

1047
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Will she be able to escape forever?

1048
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
You are so persistent

1049
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
You are really good to Miss Wuli Hua

1050
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
This is a serious injury

1051
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Can you please stop calling me?

1052
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Is Guangxi here?

1053
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
I got the news

1054
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
The Lawyer's Congress will set up a law firm

1055
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
to investigate the murder of Miss Wuli Hua

1056
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
I just came to see how I can help Guangxi

1057
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,000
She didn't answer my call this afternoon

1058
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
She wanted to come home to get some luck

1059
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
But she is not here

1060
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
You should know about this news

1061
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
She didn't tell me

1062
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
She only told me not to touch her

1063
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
I didn't use the lie to help her out in the past six years

1064
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
But after she woke up

1065
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I found out her heart was broken

1066
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I believe she has been transferred to you

1067
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
It's not your fault

1068
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000
But you need to bear all this

1069
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
I should say sorry to you

1070
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Guangxi is a strong and strong master

1071
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
He will be in trouble every time

1072
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,000
I believe the news world is the same

1073
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
He wants to solve it alone

1074
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Maybe he is worried about you

1075
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
So he didn't tell you the seriousness

1076
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
This is serious

1077
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I heard he mentioned Li Wang Cai in the painting village

1078
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
He did have a sin

1079
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
But he also said

1080
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
The lawyer is right

1081
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000
The law is right

1082
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
But the public opinion is always the same

1083
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
This is to say

1084
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
This will have a big impact on the law world

1085
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Guangxi has never been beaten

1086
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
He is too busy and too busy

1087
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
I heard my lawyer friend say

1088
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Many people are waiting for the answers

1089
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
But if Guangxi is willing to help Miss Wu

1090
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Prove that Li Wang Cai is guilty

1091
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Can you tell us the big picture of him?

1092
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,000
I really can solve the problem

1093
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,000
But he can't do that

1094
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Why?

1095
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
That's illegal

1096
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Laws are set in the law firm

1097
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
The third one is the famous one

1098
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Laws are the evidence and information provided by the lawyer

1099
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
If the lawyer doesn't get the book

1100
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,000
He can't do anything illegal

1101
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
That is to say

1102
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
If the lawyer doesn't care about Li Wang Cai's will

1103
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
And the case of the case of Miss Wu

1104
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
The serious consequence is to be killed by the lawyer

1105
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
So serious?

1106
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Laws are to protect the people

1107
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
To fight for the biggest justice and justice

1108
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
A professional lawyer

1109
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Must follow the spirit and honor

1110
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
When I was in the law firm

1111
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
I never thought of his success

1112
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
That time Guangxi had a medical certificate

1113
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,000
He was not good at balance, intelligence, and acting

1114
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
But he is willing to spend more time on his work

1115
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,000
He stays in the study room all day

1116
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,000
If you want to get close to Guangxi

1117
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
You can go to the study room

1118
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Or you will find the missing person

1119
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
I am leaving

1120
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Please tell Guangxi that I am here to see him

1121
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,000
And tell him not to face the difficulties alone

1122
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
The situation in the law firm is very similar to your past

1123
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
But the law firm is a mystery

1124
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
But the most important thing is to know and understand

1125
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:09,000
I believe you should do what you should do to get to Guangxi

1126
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
I never thought you would become a lawyer because of the investigation

1127
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Six years ago

1128
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
You really think I am a person who doesn't treat law

1129
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
But in the new year

1130
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
I am very old

1131
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Lv Ke, you broke the law

1132
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
I am still a bad person

1133
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
You are just like your father

1134
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Dad, I have seen the law firm

1135
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
I am a bad person

1136
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
I am a bad person

1137
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
I am a bad person

1138
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
I am a bad person

1139
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
I am a bad person

1140
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
But he promised

1141
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
If there is a family

1142
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
To bully Xiao Le

1143
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Xiao Le will do everything for his father

1144
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Because we all believe

1145
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Your actions are based on your thoughts

1146
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
And make the right decision

1147
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I believe you are the one who did this

1148
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Of course

1149
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Can you go to the third department with me

1150
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
I forgot you have such a boring habit

1151
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Many things

1152
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I am still a person who is a bad person

1153
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
I still have many feelings

1154
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
You can still do this

1155
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I can still do this

1156
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
But I am still a bad person

1157
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
I am still a bad person

1158
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I am a bad person

1159
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
I am a bad person

1160
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
I am not a child

1161
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,000
But I want to confess my feelings

1162
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Just like being loved by you

1163
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Suddenly I want to love

1164
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
The most greedy confession

1165
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Like a falling foot

1166
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I feel comfortable

1167
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I am alive

1168
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Suddenly I understand

1169
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Love is not the most valuable

1170
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,000
I am alive

1171
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
I am not a greedy person

1172
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,000
I am not a bad person

1173
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
I always fall in love

1174
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
And make people open their eyes

1175
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I used to be a little bit of a beggar

1176
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,000
I always fall in love

1177
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,000
And make people open their eyes

1178
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,000
I should be like this
