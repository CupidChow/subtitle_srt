1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Next, I'll broadcast for you right away.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,500
Next time, please.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,500
Who's chasing you to do this?

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,500
You used your dirty hands to pollute this piano.

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,500
I'm alone in this life.

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm always in front of the person in the silent world.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,500
This is how I see myself.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,500
Tell me in your heart.

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,500
Who would have done this to me?

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,500
How nice it is.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,500
I told you not to drag it anymore!

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,500
Are you that manly?

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,500
It's really nice to bully people like this.

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,500
Is it what you call a silent father?

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,500
You can't escape my palm.

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
Like this kind of person who is being chased by others.

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,500
Once you get locked up, you'll be so dead.

18
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,500
You're so annoying!

19
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:08,500
No matter what, you'll find a woman who will fall for you.

20
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,500
Do you want to admit that I have one last goal?

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,500
I accept your punishment.

22
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,500
Are you okay?

23
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,500
I'll introduce myself to you.

24
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,500
I'm He Yiqian, a student of your university.

25
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,500
I hope you and I can get along.

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,500
Only then will your father give me money.

27
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,500
Can you marry me?

28
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,500
I'll see what you do tomorrow.

29
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,500
I want to see the last goal of Wang Xin.

30
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,500
Can you let her fight again?

31
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,500
Wang Xin, don't promise her.

32
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,500
She'll be killed if she gets caught.

33
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,500
Go and call the police.

34
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,500
I'll take Mu Chen away after I finish the game.

35
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,500
Go to hell!

36
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,500
Are you okay, Wang Xin?

37
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,500
The wind in the sky

38
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,500
is heavier than memories

39
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,500
The city is waiting for me

40
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,500
There's a moment when the feelings are still floating

41
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:42,500
I love her, the wind is blowing

42
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,500
My dream and my heart

43
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,500
Are you fighting in the stadium at the University of Saint-Denis University?

44
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,500
Who are you?

45
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
Who doesn't matter?

46
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,500
The important thing is...

47
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,500
You...

48
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,500
Hurry up!

49
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Mu Chen, go!

50
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
What are you doing?

51
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,500
Go!

52
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,500
Go!

53
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,500
Wait!

54
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,500
Are you okay?

55
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,500
I'm fine.

56
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,500
Thank you. I didn't expect you to save me.

57
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,500
Do you know how to say it?

58
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,500
Your hair is bleeding.

59
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,500
It's okay.

60
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
Sorry.

61
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,500
If not for me,

62
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,500
you wouldn't have met these unlucky people.

63
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,500
Yes.

64
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
Since I met you,

65
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,500
the unlucky thing is to pretend to be your sister.

66
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,500
I agree.

67
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,500
I want to bully you a lot.

68
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Now...

69
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,500
Is the relationship over?

70
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
I'll go to the toilet.

71
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,500
Can you do it again?

72
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
I'm a little tired.

73
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
I'll leave in a minute.

74
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,500
I've never been in a car before.

75
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,500
It's not comfortable than I thought.

76
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
You've never been in a car before?

77
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,500
Where did you come from?

78
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,500
I was a foreigner when I was a kid.

79
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,500
I saw you from the car window.

80
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,500
I was a foreigner when I was a kid.

81
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
I was a foreigner when I was a kid.

82
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,500
I saw you from the car window when I was a kid.

83
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,500
I felt that the people in the bus decided to go there.

84
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,500
It's a very unfortunate thing.

85
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Sit down.

86
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
I've just been against you.

87
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,500
I hate being in a car when I was a kid.

88
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,500
I'm not afraid of being in a car.

89
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,500
I'm afraid that I'll be blind if I wake up like this.

90
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,500
I'm smart.

91
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,500
I'll find a seat in the car window.

92
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
I'll look out the window.

93
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,500
I'll remember every place the bus passes by.

94
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,500
I won't be able to find a place to go home.

95
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,500
I'll be a foreigner when I'm a kid.

96
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
I won't be able to find a place to go home.

97
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,500
I'll be a foreigner when I'm a kid.

98
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,500
If we meet earlier,

99
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
you can take me to the bus.

100
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
I can sit next to you.

101
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,500
I'll leave you alone.

102
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
After Tian Ying left,

103
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
that bird was still calling.

104
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
I think it's hungry.

105
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,500
Didn't you feed it?

106
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Didn't you tell me not to care about it?

107
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
Then you really can't ignore it.

108
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,500
That's why,

109
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,500
even if you know that it's impossible to keep it company,

110
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
you can't take it with you.

111
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
You can't take it with you.

112
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,500
You can't take it with you.

113
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,500
You can't take it with you.

114
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
You can't take it with you.

115
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,500
You can't take it with you.

116
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,500
Even if you know that it's impossible to keep it company,

117
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,500
you can't take it with you.

118
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,500
Because he needs me, and you.

119
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
Tian Guangxi,

120
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
I've told you last time.

121
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Don't be like this.

122
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
Why are you so stupid?

123
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
No reason.

124
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
I'm such a stupid person.

125
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,500
I can't take it with me.

126
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
My football,

127
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
my pets,

128
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
my gambling,

129
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
including the people I care about.

130
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
That day, when I was on the train,

131
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
I thought there were people coming.

132
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
I'm looking for you.

133
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
I'm looking for you.

134
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,500
I'm looking for you.

135
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,500
How's the train going?

136
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
What are you talking about?

137
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
Have you forgotten?

138
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
Even if it's a deal,

139
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,500
you still need to report to the police.

140
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Don't know it tonight.

141
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,500
Wait for me there.

142
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:43,500
The

143
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,500
The

144
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,500
This is the case of

145
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,500
the company's compensation and business dispute

146
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,500
in the past ten years.

147
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,500
If I hand it over to you,

148
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
you can guarantee

149
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
that the company will reduce the loss of the company.

150
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,500
Without this confidence,

151
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,500
you wouldn't have been on this report to the contract.

152
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
You're welcome to start from the country.

153
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,500
We welcome construction and construction.

154
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
You're very special.

155
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,500
We welcome construction

156
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
and need more talents like you.

157
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,500
Thank you, Mr. He.

158
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,500
It's a mistake.

159
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
You can say it's a accident.

160
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,500
But the second mistake is stupidity.

161
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
You know what I mean.

162
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
You've been in school.

163
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,500
You've been in school.

164
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,500
You've been in school.

165
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,500
I think it's a big surprise.

166
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,500
I promise that this mistake

167
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,500
won't happen again.

168
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,500
Please trust me, Mr. He.

169
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,500
I think it's a big surprise.

170
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,500
We've been on the charity event.

171
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,500
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

172
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,500
He's going to a hard job today.

173
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,500
Who said I'm going to a hard job?

174
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,500
I've found it.

175
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,500
Who?

176
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,500
A very special person.

177
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,500
Mr. He,

178
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,500
come and sit down.

179
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,500
It's done.

180
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,500
I'll handle it later.

181
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,500
What's the schedule today?

182
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,500
Did the chairman eat the meal?

183
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,500
No.

184
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,500
I asked for it.

185
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,500
The chairman and I

186
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,500
are going to attend an event in the afternoon.

187
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
I heard it's going to be very late.

188
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,500
I'll be very relaxed tonight.

189
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,500
The chairman's son.

190
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Yes, he's going to attend.

191
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,500
I'm afraid that I'll be in a bad mood.

192
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,500
I'm not going to attend.

193
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,500
The main purpose of the charity event

194
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,500
is to announce that

195
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
the Huan Yi Construction Company

196
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,500
is organizing a charity meeting.

197
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,500
Ms. He,

198
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,500
my uncle is in the world.

199
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
Can you help me?

200
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
Which tree is on the tree?

201
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,500
This one.

202
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,500
Okay.

203
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,500
I'm sorry.

204
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,500
I'll go first.

205
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,500
Thank you.

206
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
Thank you.

207
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,500
Thank you.

208
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,500
I thought you're not coming.

209
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,500
What's wrong with your head?

210
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,500
Nothing.

211
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,500
I just hit it with my hand.

212
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,500
Be careful.

213
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Bye.

214
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,500
Bye.

215
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,500
Why do you want to be a part of this?

216
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
I got a lot of friends from Huan Jiejie.

217
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500
I'm very careful in the United States.

218
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,500
I hope that when I return to Taiwan,

219
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,500
I can finally meet them.

220
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,500
I want to gain my strength

221
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,500
to be a part of this community.

222
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,500
If I can,

223
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
I want to help a small person.

224
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,500
I'm sorry.

225
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,500
I'm not talking about you.

226
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,500
I'm just a kid.

227
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,500
I'm a kid.

228
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,500
I'm telling you,

229
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,500
there's a coach who's coming to teach them.

230
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,500
Your purpose is...

231
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,500
This is my first time to be a part of this.

232
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
To be honest,

233
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
I know very little about medical care.

234
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
The reason I'm going to be a part of this is

235
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,500
because I'm a single child.

236
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,500
I'm going to transfer to Taiwan

237
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
from the US Academy of Medicine.

238
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,500
I hope that today,

239
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,500
I can give you a chance to introduce him.

240
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
I also hope that

241
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,500
we can take more steps to take care of him.

242
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,500
Thank you.

243
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,500
So,

244
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,500
the person who used to say that

245
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,500
was Fang Dong's son.

246
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,500
That's right.

247
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,500
The anti-cancer spirit of the athletes

248
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,500
is very active.

249
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,500
The movements are also very fast.

250
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,500
Fang Dong,

251
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,500
you're a good teacher.

252
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,500
I'm not a good teacher.

253
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,500
I don't know anything about my stupid son.

254
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
But I have a point.

255
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,500
It's good to have a good eye contact.

256
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,500
I hope that

257
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,620
this time you'll be

258
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,500
the most good trainer.

259
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,500
Fang Dong.

260
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,500
Fang zu.

261
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,500
S icte the first 400 on Singles Aquarium.

262
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,500
Do you remember someone else?

263
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,500
Did the monitor touching Su?

264
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,100
The school budget entrance exam is very good.

265
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:25,580
I was able to plan a 48-hours Heroes Report.

266
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,460
It's a bit more economical,

267
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:30,580
so I won't be Ranched with horsesc Steam Toys to play.

268
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,100
Come, Brother Chang, let's play.

269
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,100
Over here!

270
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,260
I'm really happy with my school swimming,

271
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,260
Okay, I'm done.

272
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,260
Are you okay?

273
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,260
I can't play football anymore.

274
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,260
Who says that football is only for the body.

275
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:01,260
It's the best thing to do on the field.

276
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,260
This time.

277
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,260
Come on.

278
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,260
Sister, is this your boyfriend?

279
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,260
Are you nervous?

280
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,260
I'm nervous.

281
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,260
He's the first one to be in the team.

282
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,260
You're so naughty.

283
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,260
Go.

284
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,260
I'm so nervous.

285
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,260
Brother, can we play together?

286
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,260
Okay.

287
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,260
To be honest, is it because you're not tired of playing football for your friends?

288
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,260
Or do you think it's boring?

289
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:03,260
No, I just have a date with a non-fans.

290
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:07,260
If you don't ask, I'm sorry to say goodbye to the fans.

291
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:12,260
Okay, since you're so honest, I'll accept your reason.

292
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,260
I invited you here at the same time.

293
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,260
I'll help you get out of the scene.

294
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,260
How?

295
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,260
Your mom's eyes are so good.

296
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,260
How are your eyes?

297
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,260
You're not addicted to food.

298
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,260
Which one do you like?

299
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,260
I'll help you.

300
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,260
Hello, Miss Reng.

301
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,260
Come help me!

302
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,260
Miss Reng, come help me.

303
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,260
Miss Reng.

304
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,260
Aunt, Miss Reng is fine.

305
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,260
She just came here in a hurry.

306
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,260
She's too fast. She's too fast.

307
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,260
She's too fast. She's too fast.

308
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,260
Aunt Fang, she's fine.

309
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,260
She seems to be very serious.

310
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,260
I think she's still here.

311
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,260
She's acting like she's in trouble.

312
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,260
I'm sorry.

313
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,260
Xiao Le, are you okay?

314
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,260
I've been too early to date with her.

315
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,260
I'll ask her to listen to you.

316
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,260
I'll ask her to listen to you.

317
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,260
I'll ask her to listen to you.

318
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,260
I'll ask her to listen to you.

319
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,260
I'll ask her to listen to you.

320
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,260
I'll ask her to listen to you.

321
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,260
I'll ask her to listen to you.

322
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,260
I'll ask her to listen to you.

323
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,260
I'll ask her to listen to you.

324
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,260
I'll ask her to listen to you.

325
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,260
I'll ask her to listen to you.

326
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,260
I'll ask her to listen to you.

327
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,260
I'll ask her to listen to you.

328
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,260
I'll ask her to listen to you.

329
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,260
I'll ask her to listen to you.

330
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,260
I'll ask her to listen to you.

331
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,260
Xiao Le, you're so naive.

332
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,260
You're always like this.

333
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,260
You're so naive.

334
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,260
You're always like this.

335
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,260
Now you're staring at me.

336
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,260
Are you going to do something bad?

337
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,260
Are you afraid I'll know?

338
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,260
What do you mean?

339
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,260
I'll do it.

340
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,260
You'll be late for a minute.

341
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,260
I'll do it.

342
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,260
You're so naive.

343
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,260
You're always like this.

344
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,260
You're always like this.

345
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,260
You're always like this.

346
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,260
I'll do it.

347
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,260
You go to the bathroom.

348
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,260
What's this?

349
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,260
The patient fainted.

350
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,260
Please tell me the answer.

351
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,260
Because...

352
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,260
I've already promised the person in charge

353
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,260
of the press conference

354
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,260
to report this accident.

355
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,260
I've already told you

356
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,260
that I'm not the only one who's the only one.

357
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,260
I've already told you

358
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,260
that I'm not the only one.

359
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,260
Don't worry.

360
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,260
I'm so sick.

361
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,260
I forgot to bring the medicine today.

362
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,260
I'll just go home and rest.

363
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,260
Old-fashioned.

364
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,260
You're saying that it's a fake-spot-tie

365
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,260
that deliberately slaps people.

366
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,260
Do you believe that I'm going to report the accident?

367
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,260
Let him know that someone wants to

368
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,260
put his word on his throat.

369
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,260
You don't have to let my dad know.

370
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,260
Why not?

371
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,260
This gentleman is indeed a brain-dead.

372
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,260
He's a person who's lost his oxygen and has a bad luck.

373
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,260
But the patient who's in the details

374
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,260
is the only one who knows more about it.

375
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,260
I suggest that you go to the hospital

376
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,260
and do some research to make sure that you're not in danger.

377
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,260
How is that possible?

378
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,260
He was just pretending to faint.

379
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,260
Please tell me the contract.

380
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,260
I'll go home and rest.

381
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,260
Okay.

382
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,260
Let's go.

383
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,260
You're late.

384
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:06,260
I love her, don't pretend to be desperate

385
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:12,260
My heart is deeply hurt, but I won't forget

386
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,260
I and her

387
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,260
You're late

388
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,260
It's you

389
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,260
What are you doing here?

390
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,260
Take it

391
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,260
What is it?

392
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,260
I can ask you to take off your clothes

393
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,260
What are you talking about?

394
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,260
Don't pretend

395
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:55,260
I've been dating that young man

396
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,260
I don't know what you're doing

397
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,260
I'm not like what you think

398
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,260
I'm not like what I think

399
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,260
You think I don't know what you're doing here?

400
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,260
You should have known her

401
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,260
She's a good girl

402
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,260
She's a good girl

403
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,260
I came here because I knew she wouldn't come

404
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,260
Little Ayi

405
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,260
Little Ayi is dancing with us

406
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,260
I'm free these days

407
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,260
We're free

408
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,260
Let go of me

409
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,260
Let go of me

410
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,260
Let go of me

411
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,260
Let go of me

412
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,260
I'll kill you if you do that

413
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,260
Let go of me

414
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:56,260
If you don't call me, I'll be a useless woman

415
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,260
What's wrong with her?

416
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,260
She's rich, so you should take off your clothes

417
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,260
I'm a woman who wants to be a woman

418
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,260
I beg you

419
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,260
Don't cry

420
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,260
I love you

421
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,260
I love you

422
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,260
I'll give up on you

423
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,260
After all these years

424
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,260
What are you doing?

425
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,260
What's wrong?

426
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,260
She's taking me with her

427
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,260
What's wrong?

428
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,260
She's taking me with her

429
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,260
You don't know

430
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,260
Who?

431
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,260
Let me tell you

432
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,260
She's been using me for many times

433
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,260
She said she'd give me money and a house

434
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,260
You can't do that

435
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,260
Let me tell you

436
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,260
This is evidence

437
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,260
You're a good man

438
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,260
Why?

439
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,260
Why did you choose A-Tai?

440
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,260
What?

441
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,260
It's not like that

442
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,260
It's A-Tai

443
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,260
What?

444
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,260
You told me

445
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,260
I don't believe you

446
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,260
How could she betray me?

447
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,260
I love you

448
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,260
You'll do this when you're on the mountain

449
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,260
I'll kill you if you do this

450
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,260
Look at you

451
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,260
You

452
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,260
I'm just a piece of cake

453
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,260
A-Tai!

454
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,260
I'll kill you if you do this

455
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,260
You're dead!

456
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,260
You're dead!

457
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,260
Don't kill him!

458
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,260
Stop fighting!

459
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,260
Stop fighting!

460
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,260
What are you doing?

461
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,260
Stop fighting!

462
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,260
A-Tai!

463
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,260
What's wrong?

464
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,260
Get out of the way

465
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,260
What's going on?

466
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,260
How could you beat up a fake employee?

467
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,260
What?

468
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,260
You're the only one who's been in this situation

469
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,260
I'm talking to you

470
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,260
We were in the police station

471
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,260
Why did he run away?

472
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,260
I told him I don't want to tell him

473
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,260
He's dead!

474
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,260
He's pregnant!

475
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,260
What's wrong with you?

476
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,260
Are you crazy?

477
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,260
You're not even a police officer!

478
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,260
What police officer?

479
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,260
You're a hitman!

480
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,260
You want to bring the situation to the police station?

481
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,260
Did you do something wrong?

482
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,260
Did you get a job?

483
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,260
You think we're all bullies?

484
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,260
A-Tai, congratulations

485
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,260
Shut up!

486
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,260
What else do you want to say?

487
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,260
You're a public figure

488
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,260
We'll do nothing about it

489
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,260
I'll throw you out of the way

490
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,260
What are you talking about?

491
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,260
You're not going to do anything

492
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,260
if you don't get a job

493
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,260
He's not your real self

494
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,260
You know what I mean?

495
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,260
What are you talking about?

496
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,260
Did you get a job?

497
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,260
You can't get a job!

498
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,260
Stop it!

499
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:22,260
I've already sent out the surveillance camera

500
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,260
I'm going to get it soon

501
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:30,260
If you really want to do as Zhou Xinian said

502
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,260
You won't be able to get into the police station

503
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,260
I'm afraid I'll be in trouble

504
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,260
So I'll tell the law firm that I didn't do anything wrong

505
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,260
No!

506
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,260
I'm not making trouble

507
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,260
I'm just trying to wake up

508
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,260
Wait!

509
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,260
Sit down!

510
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,260
Let's go to the police station

511
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,260
What?

512
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,260
You're not going to do anything

513
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,260
You're a big lawyer

514
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,260
We can't go to the police station

515
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,260
I'll take you back to the station

516
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,260
Get lost!

517
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,260
You're a scumbag!

518
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,260
You want to go?

519
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,260
Don't go!

520
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,260
You can't go after her

521
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:09,260
If you really want to do as you say

522
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,260
I'm just trying to get things done

523
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,260
I'm not good enough for her

524
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,260
I'd better not do anything

525
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,260
If she goes back, what will you do?

526
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,260
Let them go. The police will tell me

527
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,260
She's gone?

528
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,260
No, she's gone

529
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,260
I'll go get the medicine

530
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,260
I'm going to find you to talk to her

531
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,260
Don't go!

532
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,260
Don't go?

533
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,260
What do you want?

534
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,260
Take her back and do it again

535
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,260
That's your way of dealing with things

536
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,260
No!

537
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,260
Do you think I'm a real man?

538
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,260
I let that woman who raised her own child go to the police?

539
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,260
After she's done,

540
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,260
can she be changed?

541
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,260
You're right. She can get the revenge

542
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,260
But think about it

543
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,260
Can a victim get the justice she needs?

544
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:12,260
But the plan is not working

545
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:17,260
We can't prove that Liang Mu-chen is innocent

546
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,260
They won't believe me

547
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,260
The police will see the red smoke bomb

548
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:27,260
So that the victim will be hurt again

549
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:31,260
I know that

550
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:36,260
But what can I do?

551
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,260
Can I just step on her?

552
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:45,260
Guangxi, it's not like we have to deal with everything

553
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,260
We have a way to do it

554
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,260
But we can't use violence

555
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,260
Don't move

556
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,260
Shut up!

557
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,260
Get in there! Don't come out!

558
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:08,260
You're not going to let me run away

559
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,260
You're a coward!

560
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,260
Why are you being a coward?

561
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,260
You're a beautiful woman

562
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,260
I'm telling you

563
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,260
I'm a human being

564
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,260
I'm a human being

565
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,260
I can't do anything

566
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,260
I'm a human being

567
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,260
You're saying Mu-chen is going to kill you?

568
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,260
Why does he want to be a member?

569
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,260
He needs money

570
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,260
You don't know?

571
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,260
I don't

572
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,260
He's going to the college to get the money

573
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,260
He's going to the class to get the money

574
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:46,260
He's like the chairman's son

575
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:50,260
He's been studying in the college for several times

576
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,260
I'm not saying...

577
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,260
I'm not going to get the money

578
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,260
I don't know

579
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,260
You don't know

580
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:02,260
I don't want to be with you

581
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:06,260
You treat him as your mother

582
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,260
You go to his room

583
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,260
See if he has the money

584
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,260
He has the money in his room

585
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,260
I'm supposed to get the money

586
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,260
I was wrong

587
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,260
But I didn't tell him

588
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,260
I paid the money

589
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,260
That's because I didn't have much time

590
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,260
I didn't have money

591
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,260
I wanted to move out

592
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,260
But the money was stolen

593
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,260
I had to hide it

594
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,260
You're a coward!

595
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,260
You're a bitch!

596
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,760
You're a real man!

597
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,760
If you didn't steal her,

598
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,760
she would have taken the milk and kept you away!

599
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,760
You're so stupid!

600
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,260
You should know that I'm not that kind of person!

601
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,260
I just don't know what kind of person you are!

602
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,760
That's why I'm scared!

603
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,760
But if I didn't take you to this place,

604
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,760
I could have been better!

605
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,760
I don't want to live in a small house anymore!

606
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,760
If you don't thank me,

607
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,760
I'll just take my man!

608
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,760
I'm begging you!

609
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,760
Get out of here!

610
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,760
What are you doing?

611
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,760
Get out of here!

612
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,760
I'm sorry!

613
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,760
I'm sorry!

614
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,760
I'm sorry!

615
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,760
I'm sorry!

616
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,760
I'm begging you!

617
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,760
I'm begging you!

618
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,760
Don't leave her!

619
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,760
I don't need you!

620
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,760
I don't need you!

621
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,760
Move!

622
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,760
You really took her away!

623
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,760
I'm begging you!

624
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,760
You took her away too!

625
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,760
I'm begging you!

626
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,760
I don't want to be with you!

627
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,760
Get out of here!

628
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,760
Little Auntie!

629
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,760
Don't leave me alone!

630
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,760
Little Auntie!

631
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,760
Don't leave me alone!

632
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,760
Don't leave me alone!

633
00:33:33,260 --> 00:34:02,760
I really didn't do anything wrong.

634
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,760
Don't be angry.

635
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,760
When you get angry,

636
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,760
I'll come back to see you.

637
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,760
Your wound isn't healed yet.

638
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,760
You have to take care of yourself.

639
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,760
I'm sorry.

640
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,760
I'm sorry.

641
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,760
I'm sorry.

642
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,760
I'm sorry.

643
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,760
I'm sorry.

644
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,760
I'm sorry.

645
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,760
I'm sorry.

646
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,760
I'm sorry.

647
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,760
I'm sorry.

648
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,760
I'm sorry.

649
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,760
I'm sorry.

650
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,760
I'm sorry.

651
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,760
I'm sorry.

652
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,760

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,760
I'm sorry.

660
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,760
I'm sorry.

661
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,760
I'm sorry.

662
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,760
I'm sorry.

663
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,760
I'm sorry.

664
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,760
I'm sorry.

665
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,760
I'm sorry.

666
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,760
I'm sorry.

667
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,260
I'm sorry.

668
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,260
I'm sorry.

669
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,260
I'm sorry.

670
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,260
I'm sorry.

671
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,260
I'm sorry.

672
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,260
Can you help me?

673
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,260
Can you come over?

674
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,260
Besides,

675
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,260
you're working alone today.

676
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,260
Can't you find about your girl's girlfriend...

677
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,260
for you?

678
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,260
Sometimes,

679
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,260
I'm afraid that

680
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,260
your girl can't treat you well.

681
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,260
But,

682
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,260
you're always healthy.

683
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,260
What do you think?

684
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,260
We業 for our son's loss?

685
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,580
Normally I am alone

686
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,820
Then I will see what you would do

687
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,900
We will have intersect bet

688
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,820
chattering

689
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,520
ец

690
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,520
I've always lost my father

691
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,520
I lost my biggest support

692
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,520
He didn't leave me

693
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,520
He never gave up

694
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,520
It's also because of Uncle Ah Zai

695
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,520
I gave him a big support

696
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,520
If he left him

697
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,520
He would be like you

698
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,520
Like the father who lost him

699
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,520
Don't be so sad

700
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,520
You should care more about yourself

701
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,520
Let's go find a place to live

702
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,520
I'll be back

703
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,520
Hello, Brother Jia

704
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,520
Can you make sure this house is for me?

705
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,520
Sure

706
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,520
Where's the key?

707
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,520
OK

708
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,520
After Brother Jia bought the house,

709
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,520
he moved it from the Du family to the Wenzhi house

710
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,520
You can move in and live here

711
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,520
I'll help him to look after the house

712
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,520
I can really live here

713
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,520
You can live as long as you want

714
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,520
Don't worry

715
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,520
I want to take a bath

716
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,520
You can do it yourself

717
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,520

718
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,520

805
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,520
Thank you

806
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,520
I want to tell you a story

807
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,520
A long time ago, there was a princess

808
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,520
She was taken by a devil

809
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,520
The devil even told her

810
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,520
No one would come to save her

811
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,520
No one would come to save her

812
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,520
Then the princess called

813
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,520
The devil

814
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,520
The devil

815
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,520
Do you know who came?

816
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,520
Who?

817
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,520
No one

818
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,520
Someone called me no one

819
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,520
Because the princess called

820
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,520
The devil

821
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,520
So the devil said

822
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,520
No one would come to save her

823
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,520
You're so boring

824
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,520
I'm not kidding

825
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,520
I'm not kidding

826
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,520
I want to tell you

827
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,520
If you encounter any danger in the future

828
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,520
Don't call me a woman

829
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,520
You just have to call me Ren Guangxi

830
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,520
Then you'll appear

831
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,520
And save you

832
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,520
Thank you

833
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,520
You want to say thank you to me?

834
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,520
Actually

835
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,520
I should say sorry to you

836
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,520
If I didn't know

837
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,520
If I didn't know

838
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,520
This wouldn't have happened

839
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,520
I'll get you some drinks

840
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,520
It's better to sleep

841
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:10,540
An spring

842
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,040
I have to responsibly solve everything

843
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,780
But not violence

844
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:40,240
Si Ni Ended

845
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,240
I'm sorry. I'll leave now.

846
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,240
I'll leave now.

847
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,240
Sorry, I'm late.

848
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,740
I know I'll meet you tonight.

849
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,240
I won't take it out on you.

850
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,240
Sorry.

851
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,240
Sorry, I'm late.

852
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,740
I'm sorry.

853
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:56,240
I'm sorry.

854
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,240
I'm sorry.

855
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,240
I'm sorry.

856
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,240
I'm sorry.

857
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,240
I'm sorry.

858
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,240
I'm sorry.

859
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,240
I'm sorry.

860
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,240
I'm sorry.

861
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,240
I knew that what happened tonight would never happen again

862
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,240
But from now on

863
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,240
I won't let that happen again

864
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,240
I love him

865
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,240
Don't pretend to be desperate

866
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,240
My heart hurts deeply

867
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,240
But I won't forget

868
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,240
How about him

869
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,240
I love him

870
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,440
Aren't I too stressed out

871
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:16,200
?

872
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,040
Secret love

873
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,120
I'm dying

874
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,120
The moon is not here

875
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,640
that's all

876
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,280
J filmed.

877
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,840
They are filming a prank.

878
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,820
We need to keep it real made.

879
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:47,320
I cannot buy good scenes out of this.

880
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:52,660
This is the talk of the town.

881
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:03,940
What is it?

882
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,580
The girl?

883
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:09,200
What gets you near her?

884
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:25,980
The

885
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:33,940
Doctor we hope you are fine.

886
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:37,980
I miss you so much.

887
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:41,220
Move.

888
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:45,540
I'm really sorry.

889
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,920
Why would we be so different

890
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,140
since we are not sure about the color?

891
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:51,240
At the time,

892
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,980
we thought we could be boys

893
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,700
or girls after aけ

894
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,700
It's a fake goods.

895
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:58,700
Please.

896
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:02,700
People can even mess up with dad.

897
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:06,700
If you can spend money, you can come too.

898
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,700
I don't want to.

899
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,700
Come on.

900
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,700
Where are you going?

901
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,700
I'm going to the toilet.

902
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,700
I'm going to the toilet.

903
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,700
What's wrong?

904
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,700
What's wrong?

905
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,700
You just got into a mental breakdown.

906
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,700
Why did you start the fight?

907
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,700
One of you sold a lot of money.

908
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,700
You bought a lot of money for your classmates.

909
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,700
You bought a lot of money.

910
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,700
Let me go.

911
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,700
You didn't do anything wrong.

912
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:57,700
What are you doing?

913
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:06,700
Do you think it's a great thing to talk about others' thoughts behind others' backs?

914
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:12,700
Do you think using such a right-handed means to hurt others is a kind of justice?

915
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:16,700
You're going to the toilet with your parents.

916
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:21,700
What right do you have to sell a person to rely on your own hands to work hard?

917
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,700
No matter what he did,

918
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:26,700
you can't even judge him.

919
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,700
I said it's a fact.

920
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,700
How can you explain things like this?

921
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,700
You don't need to explain.

922
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,700
You won't do such a thing.

923
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,700
You're so good at talking.

924
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,700
You're just a customer, right?

925
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,700
What's wrong with you?

926
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,700
How can you say that again?

927
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,700
Don't be like this.

928
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,700
Don't be angry.

929
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:48,700
You're so mean.

930
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,700
You're all just a blank.

931
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,700
You're talking nonsense.

932
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:53,700
Get lost.

933
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,700
He's a compromise.

934
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,700
He's a compromise.

935
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:59,700
Use him.

936
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,700
Get out of here.

937
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,700
Get out of here.

938
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,700
Get out of here.

939
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,700
Get out of here.

940
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,700
Get out of here.

941
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,700
Get out of here.

942
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,700
Miss Zhang,

943
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,700
I've sent someone to handle the final matter.

944
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:50,700
Don't worry. I won't let this matter continue.

945
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,700
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

946
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:56,700
Thank you.

947
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:01,700
The board members know.

948
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:04,700
The students were quickly expelled from the school.

949
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:07,700
The students were in a hurry.

950
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,700
The media called and asked.

951
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,700
The board members asked me to solve this.

952
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,700
What a shame.

953
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,700
Why did you ask a family to work at the school?

954
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,700
What are you going to do?

955
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,700
I'll ask them to cancel the contract.

956
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,700
And I'll ask them to leave the school.

957
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,700
You can't do that.

958
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,700
The school that was originally called the school of the dragon head.

959
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,700
It's a private school.

960
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,700
It's a place for foreigners.

961
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,700
Liang Mu Chen didn't tell her about it.

962
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,700
She was so upset that she didn't want to do it.

963
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,700
You didn't do it.

964
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,700
You just made her feel it.

965
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:52,700
Isn't it the most important thing to make her carry this crime?

966
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,700
This is what a schoolgirl should do.

967
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:56,700
The Fang Dou is the leader.

968
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,700
The board members called and asked me

969
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:05,700
if you had a fight with that man called A-Chi last night.

970
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:09,700
The media has started to notice this.

971
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,700
Do you know your speciality?

972
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:14,700
The farther away you are from this matter.

973
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,700
This is because of me.

974
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:19,700
I have a responsibility to help her prove it.

975
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:22,700
The school's reputation is the first priority.

976
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,700
The Ministry of Education has called to close the case.

977
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:31,700
The most important thing is to find a way to settle this case.

978
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:35,700
I think finding out the truth is the most important thing.

979
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:40,700
The outside world is concerned about the reaction and handling of Shengde University.

980
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:43,700
If we only want to drive away the people who have been involved in this,

981
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,700
it will only cause a bigger reaction.

982
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,700
There is a way to not only investigate the truth,

983
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:51,700
but also to protect the social image of Shengde University.

984
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,700
What do you mean?

985
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,700
Find a way to investigate the truth.

986
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,700
To investigate the truth?

987
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,700
Ever since Shengde University was founded,

988
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,700
we have been in a big trouble and can't solve it.

989
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,700
We will find a way to find the truth.

990
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,700
We will let the two parties make a debate

991
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,700
and then investigate the truth.

992
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:15,700
Do you really think this is a good way?

993
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,700
Once the investigation is done,

994
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,700
the outside world will not let the school down.

995
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:21,700
It will be put on the teacher.

996
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:25,700
The school provides a place to let the teacher know

997
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,700
that the school can still tell the outside world the truth.

998
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,700
You have to get justice to protect the people who protect you.

999
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:36,700
You can't rely on the power.

1000
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,700
I'll take part.

1001
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,700
Those pictures that were taken out

1002
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:53,700
must be the pictures of Shengde University's CCTV.

1003
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,700
This must be a ghost that the person with the head is taking.

1004
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,700
The student who is now investigating the photos has been deleted.

1005
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,700
The person who framed you.

1006
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,700
I will find him!

1007
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:07,700
You don't even ask.

1008
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:09,700
How do you know I'm a ghost?

1009
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,700
I don't ask.

1010
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,700
It's because I don't need to ask, I know I'm a suspect.

1011
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,700
I don't even need to hide for a second.

1012
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,700
You're not that kind of person.

1013
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,700
Everyone, I found it.

1014
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:28,700
According to the results of the investigation,

1015
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:29,700
I found all the photos of the second person

1016
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,700
couldn't be deleted from this IP.

1017
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:33,700
This IP is the number of the registration.

1018
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,700
The user...

1019
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,700
is him.

1020
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,700
Zhang Ai Li.

1021
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,700
It's him.

1022
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,700
Even if you know who stole the bag,

1023
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,700
you can't prove your innocence.

1024
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,700
If you didn't get the original bag,

1025
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:53,700
the truth will still be revealed.

1026
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:56,700
Even if there's not enough evidence,

1027
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,700
you can prove your innocence.

1028
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:00,700
This is the meaning of the law.

1029
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,700
I heard the dog just now.

1030
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:08,700
I know what happened in the hall of the holy temple.

1031
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,700
The school just announced that

1032
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,700
they decided to establish a real investigation.

1033
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,700
And the day after tomorrow,

1034
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,700
the school president is the head of the investigation.

1035
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,700
The board of directors and the members of the school

1036
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:21,700
have their own results.

1037
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:22,700
Because you and that person

1038
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,700
are not from our school,

1039
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,700
so you can still decide by yourself.

1040
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,700
Mo Chen.

1041
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,700
If you're willing,

1042
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,700
I can be your guardian.

1043
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:35,700
What?

1044
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,700
This is to help the person who studies law and study

1045
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:39,700
to help Mo Chen become a guardian.

1046
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,700
But he's not a guardian.

1047
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:42,700
This investigation

1048
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:45,700
is to prove the chance of Mo Chen's innocence.

1049
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,700
Mo Chen, what do you think?

1050
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:53,700
Why?

1051
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,700
You won't know.

1052
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,700
From that day till now,

1053
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:12,700
only Mo Chen had the strength to see

1054
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:15,700
and to be from the God's side.

1055
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,700
If you want to help Mu Chen to defend you, then he's not a loser.

1056
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:24,700
This investigation room is the only chance for us to prove Mu Chen is innocent.

1057
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:28,700
Mu Chen, what do you think?

1058
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:37,700
If the investigation room can really find out the truth,

1059
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:40,700
Cai Shu must be kicked out of school.

1060
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:43,700
But the restaurant is also closed.

1061
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,700
What will the little sister do?

1062
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,700
When?

1063
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,700
You want that little girl from the machine?

1064
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,700
If you really care about her,

1065
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:54,700
you'll see how clear Zhou Jincai is.

1066
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:04,700
So you accept it?

1067
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:07,700
Why don't you bury me, if you're afraid?

1068
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:09,700
Xiao outrageous!

1069
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:19,700
Since it's about to Quadrupleay,

1070
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:24,700
I'll take my responsibleAs a copy from Z Chao Ai Li Elimination to take it back to the Point Soc.

1071
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,700
If I can find the witness scene with the truth Pale exploited,

1072
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:31,700
I'll prove that where you belong.

1073
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,700
I will do my best to find out the truth.

1074
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,700
I will not lose.

1075
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:39,700
Don't let everyone know that Yang Muchen is such a person.

1076
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,700
Let your auntie trust you again.

1077
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:45,700
Does that auntie need to help them change?

1078
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:49,700
They are not familiar with the life of the school. Who will help them?

1079
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:56,700
You want to be my pervert?

1080
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:57,700
That's right.

1081
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:00,700
Just like the person in law, who wants to open up to the Parisian students,

1082
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:01,700
has a self-proclaimed reputation.

1083
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,700
Now that you have raised your matter,

1084
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,700
the school wants to give you an explanation.

1085
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:08,700
It needs you to be in the first place and clarify the whole incident.

1086
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,700
The explanation is your good and bad relationship.

1087
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:14,700
We can't just participate in any real investigation.

1088
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,700
The real investigation has been confirmed.

1089
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:21,700
If the official official says the truth is that you have committed a crime,

1090
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,700
and you have not been in the first place,

1091
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:26,700
it means that you admit that you have done that.

1092
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,700
Of course, you have to participate.

1093
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,700
You have to make it clear.

1094
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:43,180
So that the people outside can misunderstand the sound of the student's

1095
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:44,700
day-to-day life.

1096
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:45,700
Don't worry.

1097
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,700
I have been in the school for three years.

1098
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,700
I have never lost any of my practical skills.

1099
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:51,700
Whether it is the form or the name,

1100
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:53,700
as long as I help you,

1101
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:56,700
the student who should have been expelled earlier,

1102
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:59,700
you are afraid to be close to me.

1103
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:04,700
I will remember this lawsuit and let Ren Guangxi lose his first place.

1104
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:07,700
I will tell him that life is based on practical skills,

1105
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:11,700
not on the background of relationship.

1106
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:13,700
The day Kai Ting was in the hospital,

1107
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:15,700
as long as you give me the word of good and bad,

1108
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:18,700
I guarantee that Ren Guangxi and Liang Muchen

1109
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:21,700
will never be able to get through this life.

1110
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:27,700
I want to speed up this videos,

1111
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:31,700
but you can't even calm down.

1112
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:34,700
It's tooこうx.

1113
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:36,700
Damn.

1114
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:41,700
Think of it.

1115
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:50,880
I have thought about it.

1116
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:52,860
We're ruined?

1117
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:56,300
Call the police if you want

1118
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:57,560
So you still take up the evidence

1119
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:03,860
We have to leave now

1120
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:07,500
Gather some good news to us

1121
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:09,980
ffeepeep

1122
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:10,780
This is my friend

1123
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,200
bye

1124
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:18,120
I have to investigate the proffesionalPlease

1125
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:19,620
if possible

1126
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:21,620
I'd rather be the one to be the judge

1127
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:23,620
Everyone must stick to the end

1128
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:26,620
I won't lose to you guys

1129
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:47,620
See? As long as you believe in him, he can do it

1130
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:53,620
Who is Liang Mu Chen?

1131
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:56,620
How can he be so serious about the relationship?

1132
01:02:57,620 --> 01:03:00,620
He's the one who's been pretending to be a loser

1133
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:09,620
That day, Liang Mu Chen went to the hall of the holy temple

1134
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:13,620
I've told you many times

1135
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:16,620
Don't be a rascal when you talk

1136
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:19,620
Even if you're a loser, you should learn it

1137
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:43,620
Put your foot down, you're cheating

1138
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:48,620
I'm the one who's been pretending to be a loser

1139
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:53,620
The most exciting game in the online game

1140
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:58,620
The horse is running, the horse is running, the queen is on the throne

1141
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:07,620
The Queen of the Riding Hood, Huang Jing Cheng, Zhao Cai Mao, Zhang Deng, Zhao Gaopai, and the Queen of the Riding Hood

1142
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:11,620
Please give us a chance to join the Riding Hood

1143
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:14,620
The Queen of the Riding Hood, Zhang Deng, Zhao Cai Mao, and the Queen of the Riding Hood

1144
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:16,620
Let's go

1145
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:27,620
Mom, are you feeling unwell?

1146
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:31,620
I'm fine

1147
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:35,620
I didn't expect so many people wouldn't want to be a loser

1148
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:38,620
They wouldn't want to be a loser

1149
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:41,620
Can I help you?

1150
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:45,620
You are the real person like this

1151
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:50,620
What you and I can do is to believe that no matter what method you use

1152
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:52,620
I will win this battle

1153
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:56,620
Are you ready to win?

1154
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:00,620
I'll be with you to see how you will answer

1155
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:05,620
Let's go

1156
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:16,620
The Queen of the Riding Hood, Huang Jing Cheng, Zhao Gaopai, and the Queen of the Riding Hood

1157
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:18,620
Hello

1158
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:20,620
Hello, I'm He Yiqian

1159
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:22,620
Come out and meet me

1160
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:23,620
You won't regret it

1161
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:28,620
Okay

1162
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:32,620
What's wrong?

1163
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:34,620
You didn't even get to go to the football game

1164
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:37,620
You are worried that you will hear the game

1165
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:41,620
You are so stubborn

1166
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:44,620
You know I'm the most short-tempered now

1167
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:46,620
What's your problem? Tell me

1168
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:50,620
According to my understanding, Xu Fang Huo is your best friend

1169
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:53,620
He's been attacking the city on the court

1170
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:55,620
You are the only defense

1171
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:58,620
But you are the only one who can defeat him

1172
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:00,620
I think you are the only one

1173
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:01,620
You are also the only one

1174
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:06,620
I love to play

1175
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:22,620
What's wrong?

1176
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:24,620
What's wrong?

1177
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:27,620
Maybe the ball was too intense just now

1178
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:31,620
What are you doing?

1179
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:35,620
You are playing with my ball now

1180
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:37,620
Hurry up

1181
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:54,620
You suddenly lost your mind, right?

1182
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:57,620
Did you have a headache?

1183
01:06:57,620 --> 01:06:59,620
You lost your memory and lost your memory

1184
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:02,620
This is the injury caused by the football game

1185
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:04,620
There's nothing serious

1186
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:09,620
You were really fainted at the club that day

1187
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:12,620
I think you should find a doctor

1188
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:14,620
to help you to be a healthy person

1189
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:18,620
I'm sorry

1190
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:20,620
I should help you to be a healthy person

1191
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:21,620
I love to play

1192
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:53,620
I think you should find a doctor to help you to be a healthy person

1193
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:57,620
Miss, I don't have the time to do this

1194
01:07:57,620 --> 01:07:59,620
I have to open the door the next day

1195
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:02,620
I don't have enough time, no witnesses, no evidence

1196
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:05,620
I haven't found the missing monitor

1197
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:07,620
How can I deal with Xu Fang Huo?

1198
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:12,620
Have you heard of the word,

1199
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:16,620
let's talk about the game

1200
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:19,620
When the opponent wants to score,

1201
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:21,620
there will be a lot of breakthroughs

1202
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:24,620
So the detail of Xu Fang Huo's strategy

1203
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:26,620
is the key to your victory

1204
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:32,620
Yuqi, let's sit here and laugh

1205
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:34,620
Why don't we spend our last effort

1206
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:36,620
to find out Xu Fang Huo's potential

1207
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:43,620
You're right

1208
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:48,620
To be honest, success after failure is not bad for me

1209
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:50,620
Everyone thinks I've lost

1210
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:53,620
But this girl is different from me

1211
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:56,620
She's kind and pure

1212
01:08:57,620 --> 01:09:00,620
She's always so stupid to save me

1213
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:03,620
She only has me to help

1214
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:05,620
You're right

1215
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:14,620
I came to you, so I'm going to help you

1216
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:21,620
This is for you

1217
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:26,620
This is the gift you gave me when you were a kid

1218
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:28,620
What's this?

1219
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:32,620
This is the medical report I collected

1220
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:34,620
It's a personal analysis of the victim's crime

1221
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:36,620
It should be helpful to you

1222
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:40,620
Thank you

1223
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:43,620
You and your mom will play basketball with your friends

1224
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:45,620
Golf, tennis, rugby

1225
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:47,620
I'm willing to give it to you

1226
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:49,620
This is for you

1227
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:51,620
As for the rest, I think you should

1228
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:53,620
find some experts to give you some advice

1229
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:56,620
And you should think about it

1230
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:59,620
Who can help you and give you strength

1231
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:01,620
to protect that girl?

1232
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:11,620
I'm going back to the US to study

1233
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:14,620
If you don't lose, I'll give you a chance

1234
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:17,620
to get better at golf

1235
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:20,620
You should live well before I come back

1236
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:17,620
Come in

1237
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:25,620
I just wanted to see you

1238
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:47,620
You can't study for four years in three days

1239
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:49,620
Or I'll help you to get better at golf

1240
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:50,620
Sit down

1241
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:06,620
There are many anti-cancer records

1242
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:08,620
You should know how to solve the problem

1243
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:11,620
And you should be able to solve the problem

1244
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:13,620
You should be able to solve the problem

1245
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:17,620
And you should be able to solve the problem

1246
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:19,620
of Xu Fang's attack

1247
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:21,620
We'll do our best to help you

1248
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:25,620
I'll take Mu Chen to see her

1249
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:27,620
and ask her to take the test

1250
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:31,620
I'll stay up with you tonight

1251
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:33,620
Don't worry

1252
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:36,620
I'll keep her in my arms like a 99-year-old

1253
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:38,620
Very good

1254
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:41,620
It's right to find Lin Lixia

1255
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:44,620
He's the most important and last king

1256
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:48,620
But some people are happy and safe

1257
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:53,620
It's hard to find him

1258
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:56,620
But let's do it

1259
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:05,620
I'll be here tonight

1260
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:09,620
If you have any questions, you can ask me

1261
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:38,620
I'll be here tonight

1262
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:09,620
He should go out

1263
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:13,620
He'll forget everything if he goes out

1264
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:17,620
Xiao Ai is the most important person we have

1265
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:19,620
If we can convince him to listen to you

1266
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:21,620
Then we'll win

1267
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:23,620
Let's go in together

1268
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:35,620
Don't worry

1269
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:38,620
I'm not a good person

1270
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:41,620
I'll let the young girl have a good taste

1271
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:44,620
I've been practicing this special talent with my mom for years

1272
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:48,620
Xiao Ai is not yet angry

1273
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:52,620
If she sees me, she might not even want to talk

1274
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:55,620
Let's not go in

1275
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:57,620
Okay, I'll go talk to her

1276
01:14:57,620 --> 01:14:59,620
Be careful

1277
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:01,620
Call me if you need anything

1278
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:09,620
Where's Mu Chen?

1279
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:38,620
I'll never forget

1280
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:43,620
Mu Chen?

1281
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:52,620
You scared me

1282
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:57,620
You're here alone?

1283
01:15:57,620 --> 01:16:00,620
What? Do you want Mu Chen to come too?

1284
01:16:00,620 --> 01:16:02,620
Are you kidding me?

1285
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:04,620
He'll only be beaten by me

1286
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:08,620
How is it?

1287
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:11,620
Young Master, what are you doing here today?

1288
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:15,620
I'll go get you

1289
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:19,620
Sit down

1290
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:22,620
This is my house, of course I can sit down

1291
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:51,620
I want to talk to you about tomorrow's truth

1292
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:54,620
I hope you can help Mu Chen

1293
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:59,620
Three words? No way! I can't help him!

1294
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:10,620
Someone said that a girl would look after her

1295
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:12,620
and teach her what her mother is

1296
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:17,620
How do you think Mu Chen is doing this for money?

1297
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:21,620
Do you think you're a good teacher?

1298
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:28,620
I never dared to be her mother

1299
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:30,620
I don't deserve her

1300
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:32,620
She never cared about me

1301
01:17:32,620 --> 01:17:35,620
We're very close

1302
01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:38,620
I told her to study

1303
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:41,620
I'm not a good teacher

1304
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:44,620
I know what kind of person she is

1305
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:46,620
She's a good teacher

1306
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:51,620
Even if you're talking nonsense, I won't help her tomorrow

1307
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:53,620
Do you understand?

1308
01:17:53,620 --> 01:17:55,620
She seduced my husband

1309
01:17:56,620 --> 01:17:59,620
You're being fooled

1310
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:03,620
You're a good teacher

1311
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:05,620
You can be a lawyer

1312
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:08,620
You can't be a lawyer

1313
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:10,620
I was a poor man when I was a kid

1314
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:12,620
Otherwise, I'd be a loser

1315
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:19,620
What are you doing?

1316
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:24,620
I'm telling you, I'm going to break your name

1317
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:26,620
Excuse me?

1318
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:29,620
When I was in the investigation, they agreed to let us stay here

1319
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:32,620
So I'm doing everything in accordance with the law

1320
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:40,620
Besides, the truth about the secret behind the crime

1321
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:42,620
is what everyone would do

1322
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:47,620
I don't believe you think Mu Chen is like this

1323
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:51,620
You're just trying to ignore these messages

1324
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:53,620
I don't want to believe you're wrong

1325
01:18:56,620 --> 01:18:58,620
I'm sorry

1326
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:09,620
If you were hit by a thunder,

1327
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:11,620
you'd see a lamb kneeling down to drink milk

1328
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:14,620
You'd think how much Mu Chen would do for you

1329
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:17,620
So you decided to hit me for him

1330
01:19:26,620 --> 01:19:28,620
Mu Chen

1331
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:38,620
Mu Chen

1332
01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:58,620
Mu Chen

1333
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:04,620
I'm so proud of you

1334
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:06,620
I feel like I'm being helped

1335
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:08,620
How can you repay me?

1336
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:11,620
If we win tomorrow, I'll be a good cook

1337
01:20:11,620 --> 01:20:14,620
Not only that, I'll be a good cook

1338
01:20:14,620 --> 01:20:16,620
Let's start the investigation

1339
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:18,620
According to Ms. Liang,

1340
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:20,620
this is her wedding ceremony

1341
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:21,620
She's the one who came here

1342
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:23,620
So you're not just a criminal

1343
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:25,620
You're a criminal too

1344
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:28,620
You're just trying to make me pay for it

1345
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:33,620
If I were to get rid of Mu Chen,

1346
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:36,620
how would she know we're living together?

1347
01:20:43,620 --> 01:20:46,620
Ms. Liang has been a member of the Shenzhen Hall

1348
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:51,620
She's the biggest enemy ever since she was a kid

1349
01:20:51,620 --> 01:20:54,620
Why hasn't she used anyone?

1350
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:57,620
Then please give me a person who's not interested in you

1351
01:20:57,620 --> 01:20:59,620
to prove your innocence

1352
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:01,620
I can prove it

1353
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:03,620
I want to cherish someone for the first time

1354
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:07,620
I want to make myself better for her

1355
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:11,620
Because I believe that this world is not too difficult

1356
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:15,620
If I win, you'll be a good cook

1357
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:17,620
You should go back to your room

1358
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:19,620
Sorry

1359
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:21,620
This is faster

1360
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:24,620
This is my first time to be a cook

1361
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:28,620
You're quite talented

1362
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:32,620
I think you should give it a try

1363
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:35,620
Hua Jin, this isn't a business

1364
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:37,620
You're in a bad mood

1365
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:43,620
This is the last time you'll be in a bad mood

1366
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:46,620
You should at least have a few months left

1367
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:54,620
I'm not a kid

1368
01:21:54,620 --> 01:21:57,620
I'm just a little kid

1369
01:21:57,620 --> 01:21:59,620
I'm just a little kid

1370
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:01,620
I'm just a little kid

1371
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:03,620
I'm just a little kid

1372
01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:05,620
I'm just a little kid

1373
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:07,620
I'm just a little kid

1374
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:09,620
I'm just a little kid

1375
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:11,620
I'm just a little kid

1376
01:22:11,620 --> 01:22:13,620
I'm just a little kid

1377
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:15,620
I'm just a little kid

1378
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:17,620
I'm just a little kid

1379
01:22:17,620 --> 01:22:19,620
I'm just a little kid

1380
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:21,620
I'm just a little kid

1381
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:23,620
I'm just a little kid

1382
01:22:23,620 --> 01:22:25,620
I'm just a little kid

1383
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:27,620
I'm just a little kid

1384
01:22:27,620 --> 01:22:29,620
I'm just a little kid

1385
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:31,620
I'm just a little kid

1386
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:33,620
I'm just a little kid

1387
01:22:33,620 --> 01:22:35,620
I'm just a little kid

1388
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:37,620
I'm just a little kid

1389
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:39,620
I'm just a little kid

1390
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:41,620
I'm just a little kid

1391
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:43,620
I'm just a little kid

1392
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:45,620
I'm just a little kid

1393
01:22:45,620 --> 01:22:47,620
I'm just a little kid

1394
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:51,620
I used to fall in love

1395
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:55,620
But I still let people open their eyes

1396
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:59,620
It turned out that I was worth waiting for

1397
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:03,620
I used to fall in love

1398
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:07,620
But I still let people open their eyes

1399
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:13,620
It turned out that I should be like this

1400
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:19,620
Ta-da
