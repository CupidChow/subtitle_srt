1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I think you should trust each other more

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,500
Trusting each other is mutual

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,000
If you trust each other first

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Maybe you'll find that many things are different

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Mu Chen, you're my best friend

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But if you're with your husband, you'll be a burden to him

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
People won't be able to help you, but they'll be able to help you

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
To me, being a burden is very important

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
No matter what, I won't care about him

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Do you know that you don't know how to get along with someone?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Because you don't know what he thinks

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You don't know what he thinks, you can ask him

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Sometimes you worry that his answer is not what you want

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Otherwise you'll be in trouble

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You know that I'm scared to be with you every day

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Be careful

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Even if you take the first step, I'm afraid that you'll be the limit

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And your excuse will change every day

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
If I say the same thing

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Because I'm scared, I'll push you away

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I can tell you who you love

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Who you love, can be the one who makes mistakes

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I hope we can find the one who will save you

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The one who can reach the end

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The most famous paradise The最 final дер

26
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We are very lucky.

27
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's just the two of us.

28
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Because you broke the nail.

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Why did you leave?

30
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
No reason.

31
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I was too much of a fan.

32
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Me too.

33
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I've been thinking about what you want to say to me.

34
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And the question you asked me.

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I was thinking, I should tell you.

36
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Why did I leave you six years ago?

37
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Guangxi.

38
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I suddenly found out that we never danced together.

40
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
From my life.

41
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The New Beijing Entertainment Center 994466.

42
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I almost died.

43
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I forgot something.

44
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I met you again.

45
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Then I knew we were not young.

46
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
We never danced together.

47
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I really know you.

48
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I really know you.

49
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
How should I believe?

50
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
How to judge?

51
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
In front of me.

52
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What is true?

53
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What is not?

54
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What is not?

55
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What is not?

56
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
What is not?

57
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
In front of you.

58
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What is not?

59
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What is not?

60
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What is not?

61
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What are you doing?

62
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You're a man.

63
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm not that kind of man.

64
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Get ready.

65
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You're not a man.

66
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You're a man.

67
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yes.

68
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I have a friend to talk to.

69
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'll take care of it.

70
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What are you doing?

71
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You're a man.

72
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Why are you so loud?

73
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You're a man.

74
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
No, no.

75
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Don't do this.

76
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What are you doing?

77
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You're a man.

78
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You're a man.

79
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Brother Dong.

80
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You're a man.

81
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'll take care of you as I say.

82
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'll talk to him.

83
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
He's a man.

84
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Brother Dong.

85
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I've checked the house.

86
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'll think of something to do.

87
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm sure it's okay.

88
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But I'm worried about you.

89
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You're so serious.

90
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What if something happens to them?

91
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's important to get the information out.

92
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Listen to me.

93
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I've set up a phone number.

94
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Brother Dong will call you.

95
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Call us and we'll do it.

96
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Okay?

97
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Be careful.

98
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You too.

99
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Brother Dong.

100
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Brother Dong.

101
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You're a man.

102
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What are you doing?

103
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Put him down.

104
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Welcome, Mr. Hua.

105
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm waiting for you.

106
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
We're not young.

107
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
We're young and we're good at drawing.

108
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Are you a real man?

109
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You're a real man.

110
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'll take care of you.

111
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Or I'll call you again.

112
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'll call you again.

113
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What?

114
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You're a man.

115
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm serious.

116
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'll call you again.

117
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'll call you again.

118
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll call you again.

119
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You're a real man.

120
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Money!

121
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Here.

122
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Take it.

123
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You're trying to fool me.

124
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You're not going to tell me.

125
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm a real man.

126
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm not a real man.

127
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm not a real man.

128
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What's the matter?

129
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm telling you.

130
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm a man.

131
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
He's a real man.

132
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'll help him.

133
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm a real man.

134
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm a man.

135
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm a real man.

136
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm a real man.

137
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You're a real man.

138
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You're a real man.

139
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'll kill you.

140
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'll kill you.

141
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'll kill you.

142
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You're a real man.

143
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'll kill you.

144
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'll kill you.

145
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'll kill you.

146
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'll kill you.

147
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Go.

148
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000

155

Go.

156
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000

Go.

165

171
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Go.

172
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Get out of the way!

173
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Get out of the way!

174
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Get out of the way!

175
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Take her away!

176
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Take her away!

177
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Take her away!

178
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

179
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I didn't finish what I said.

180
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Actually...

181
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Maybe...

182
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You should listen to my answer first.

183
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I said that we might still have a chance.

184
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
But if we really want to start over,

185
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I just hope you'll be honest with me.

186
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'll do my best.

187
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I just hope you'll be honest with me.

188
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
My life before was all a lie.

189
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I really can't be cheated anymore.

190
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
No matter what happened six years ago,

191
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
you'd leave me.

192
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Or now, you should tell me anything.

193
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'll accept whatever you say.

194
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Don't be so anxious to answer.

195
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Don't be so proud of me.

196
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I know that this is something that you've been watching over us.

197
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
But if you want to start over like me,

198
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I just need an answer.

199
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
There's still a chance.

200
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
As long as you're willing to tell me.

201
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I know that this is something that you've been watching over us.

202
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
But if you want to start over like me,

203
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I just need an answer.

204
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
There's still a chance.

205
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
As long as you're willing to tell me.

206
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Let's start over.

207
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Take responsibility for our future two years ahead.

208
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You need to be more patient.

209
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
What you said

210
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Your kiss

211
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Is everything real?

212
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I believe you are good

213
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Of course it's real

214
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm not a bad person

215
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What?

216
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
What's the excuse?

217
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
What? Why don't you answer?

218
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Why do you suddenly ask this?

219
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Is this real?

220
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Why?

221
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You still want to lie to me?

222
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Why do you ask this?

223
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
What's the excuse?

224
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Why do you say this?

225
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Why do you ask this?

226
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You still want to lie to me?

227
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Is this real?

228
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Why do you ask this?

229
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Why do you ask this?

230
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:53,100
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

231
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,860
I'm not here.

232
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,180
I'll come back for you.

233
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,020
I came back for you.

234
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,460
I will send you away.

235
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,500
It's okay.

236
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,900
Hope you are okay.

237
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,140
This is 밑

238
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,300
Pretty Shredded

239
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:10,780
You didn't keep a precio

240
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,980
It's Fang Ge

241
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,180
If you call me a brother

242
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,180
Tell me what happened

243
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,180
Enough

244
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,380
This kind of thing

245
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,580
Know the less and the better

246
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,180
You don't know how to kill Fang Ge

247
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,180
I know you

248
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,180
You can't be a murderer

249
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,180
No one can kill you

250
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,180
How can you kill someone like that?

251
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,180
You're a bastard

252
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,180
You know the whole village

253
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,180
You're a ghost

254
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,180
What if you're found?

255
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,180
Anyway

256
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,180
Today's the day

257
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,180
I'm going to kill Fang Ge

258
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,180
I'm going to kill Fang Ge

259
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,180
I'm going to kill Fang Ge

260
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,180
I'm going to kill Fang Ge

261
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,180
I'm going to kill Fang Ge

262
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,580
Don't let anyone know about today

263
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,580
Especially me

264
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,580
Take the assassin back

265
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,580
I'm going to another place

266
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,180
Where are you going?

267
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,180
You don't know

268
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,180
You don't know how to kill yourself?

269
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,580
You go to my house first

270
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,580
Get me a clean and clean jacket

271
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,980
Have to tell everyone

272
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,980
到底

273
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,460
Okay, I got it.

274
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:23,940
Thanks, your'e my á currently الص

275
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:33,680
Ownerbone

276
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:39,000
Of course, I love you so much.

277
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,400
Nice to meet you.

278
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,720
Good day.

279
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,700
Excuse me,

280
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:05,700
I just want to take one out of my life.

281
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,700
I won't be hurt.

282
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,700
I just want to be happy.

283
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,700
Take one out.

284
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,700
Don't be sad.

285
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:32,700
If you want to run away, I can run away with you.

286
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:38,700
When we settle down, we can go together.

287
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,700
If you worry about me,

288
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,700
I will help you to be free.

289
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,700
I will help you to be at your best.

290
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,700
You mean

291
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,700
I killed someone.

292
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,700
You want to help me to be at your best.

293
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,700
You want to help me to be at your best.

294
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,700
Brother Fang did so much bad things to me.

295
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,700
If I was at your best,

296
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,700
I wouldn't be afraid of him.

297
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:44,700
Brother Fang, don't you think so?

298
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:15,700
Here, I will take one for you.

299
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,960
May I go home?

300
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,700
It feels weird

301
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,500
but my sister

302
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,860
No leads took my killer to Shownhorn's house.

303
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,300
It must be Jixing!

304
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,460
Xiaoxiao...

305
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,820
You got�

306
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,740
my kid Skeleton 2!

307
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,100
To go down there

308
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,740
There's so much trouble going on

309
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:07,180
ougu

310
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,580
I want to leave.

311
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,180
Why?

312
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,180
No! You said you wanted to stay with me.

313
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:16,580
You said you didn't want to leave me. You said you would.

314
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,780
Okay, okay, okay.

315
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,780
I won't leave. I'm sorry.

316
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,780
I'm sorry.

317
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:52,180
I'm asking you again. Is this real?

318
00:29:52,180 --> 00:30:12,180
From now on, I just hope you can find me.

319
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:19,180
But you didn't.

320
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:29,180
When I was serious about you, I just hope you can give me your hope.

321
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:38,180
You chose to lie to me.

322
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:45,180
You can do anything to lie to me.

323
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:49,180
I thought you were really the one who blocked me.

324
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:56,180
I thought everything you said today was true.

325
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:05,580
I really want to believe that the kiss was also true.

326
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:13,180
But you made me unable to believe it.

327
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:17,180
No matter what happened six years ago or six years later,

328
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:26,180
you were like a fool to me.

329
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:34,380
As long as you treat me well, I'll be the one who's going to be the one to say it.

330
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,780
Wang Xin, things are not like this. Please explain to me.

331
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:44,980
Are you telling me the truth?

332
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,980
You've never loved me before.

333
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,580
Yes.

334
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:51,580
You lied to me. If you really did, you wouldn't lie to me

335
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:55,180
and hide our marriage from me for the sake of the painting.

336
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,180
I gave you a chance.

337
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:03,380
I begged you to tell me the truth.

338
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:19,380
But you gave me the last chance.

339
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,980
Is it her?

340
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,980
Wang Xin, I will do this to hide it from you.

341
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,780
It's because I'm afraid you'll be angry.

342
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:36,780
It's not what you think. It's a special situation. Don't misunderstand me.

343
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:49,380
You're scaring me.

344
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,380
I can't do anything now.

345
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,580
What? Something happened?

346
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:56,580
Brother Fang is going to be the one to do it.

347
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,780
Wang Xin, I'll explain to you about this.

348
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,380
I'm going to find her now.

349
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,180
Don't tell me it's a special situation.

350
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,180
How many times do you have a special situation?

351
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:07,580
I'm going to find her as long as I'm the one to do it.

352
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,380
Wang Xin, I don't know what your situation is now.

353
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,580
I know I'm going to find her now.

354
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,380
Remember, you...

355
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:19,780
If you go to find that flower, I'll be done with you.

356
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:23,980
Don't forget that you came here today.

357
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:43,080
Savers are all looking forward to seeing you on the next one.

358
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:52,180
I want to tell you my choice.

359
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:55,580
</i Responseşallah

360
00:33:55,580 --> 00:34:01,640
At midnight we've been looking for him

361
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,980
!

362
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:18,980
I will never forget your deep hurt

363
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,980
I will never forget your hurt

364
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,980
Gong Xi, I don't know what your situation is right now

365
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,980
I know I'm going to find him right now

366
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,980
Please believe me

367
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,980
You're not going to find that flower

368
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,980
I'll play with you

369
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,980
Don't forget

370
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,980
You came here today

371
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,980
I want to tell you a choice

372
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,980
I'm sorry

373
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,980
I can't leave him

374
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,980
If there's still a regret

375
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,980
What should I do?

376
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,980
I'm afraid I can't understand

377
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,980
I finally heard your true words

378
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:31,980
I used to lean on each other's shoulders

379
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:35,980
Now I'm wandering in the crowd

380
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,980
I love him

381
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,980
The red lotus is the craziest

382
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:47,980
My dream is cruel, but I will never forget

383
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,980
I can't see the love

384
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,980
The deeper I get, the more I want to hurt

385
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:57,980
The more I love, the more I hate

386
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,980
What should I do?

387
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:03,980
How to love?

388
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,980
I'm the only one who cares

389
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,980
I love him

390
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:10,980
The red lotus is the craziest

391
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:16,980
My dream is cruel, but I will never forget

392
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,980
I can't see the love

393
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:22,980
The deeper I get, the more I hate

394
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,980
What should I do?

395
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,980
I'm afraid I can't understand

396
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,980
I finally heard your true words

397
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,980
I used to lean on each other's shoulders

398
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,980
Now I'm wandering in the crowd

399
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,980
I love him

400
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,980
The red lotus is the craziest

401
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:49,980
My dream is cruel, but I will never forget

402
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,980
I can't see the love

403
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,980
The deeper I get, the more I hate

404
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,980
What should I do?

405
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,980
I'm afraid I can't understand

406
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,980
I finally heard your true words

407
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,980
Don't look at me like that

408
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:24,980
I'll be in trouble if I'm with Zhixing

409
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:29,980
No, it's not a matter of time

410
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,980
I'll go and ask Fang'er

411
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,980
Let's talk about it

412
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,980
Can you stop being impulsive?

413
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,980
Don't be like a woman

414
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:50,980
I know what I've done

415
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,980
I killed Fang'er

416
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:01,980
He's dead

417
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,980
The police will come to us sooner or later

418
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,980
It's useless

419
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:11,980
So I decided to take care of myself

420
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,980
Yes

421
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,980
Take care

422
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,980
Yes

423
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,980
My love

424
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,980
Long time no see

425
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,980
Actually it's not a long time

426
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,980
So I don't believe

427
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,980
that in such a short time

428
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,980
a personality will suddenly change

429
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,980
The flower leaves I know

430
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,980
I can't threaten the people.

431
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,980
I don't believe you.

432
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,980
What happened? Why are you lying?

433
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,980
Don't think about it.

434
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,980
Nothing is impossible.

435
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,980
Especially seeing Fang brother treat Chi Xin like that

436
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,980
and the pain she suffered for me.

437
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,980
I will do anything for her.

438
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,980
Stop fighting!

439
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,980
Hua Zou Yan, you killed Hua's parents.

440
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,980
We brought the police and all the people in the scene

441
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,980
have been killed by me.

442
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,980
I killed them.

443
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,980
It has nothing to do with them.

444
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,980
You are wrong.

445
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,980
Hello.

446
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,980
Mr. Yizhen?

447
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,980
Yes.

448
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,980
Hello, this is the first division.

449
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,980
Your wife is a criminal.

450
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,980
Please come over.

451
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,980
Brother Duan.

452
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,980
It's okay.

453
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,980
It's okay.

454
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,980
Open your eyes.

455
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,980
Duan!

456
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,980
I am Xin Nan.

457
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,980
I am Xin Nan.

458
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,980
I am Xin Nan.

459
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:02,980
What are you doing?

460
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,980
Do you know what I told you?

461
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,980
I am Xin Nan's wife.

462
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,980
I am your mother.

463
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,980
I told you that I am Xin Nan's wife.

464
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,980
She is a criminal.

465
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,980
She is a criminal.

466
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,980
I am her wife.

467
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,980
I am her wife.

468
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,980
I am her wife.

469
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,980
She is a criminal.

470
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,980
She is a criminal.

471
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,980
You can't congratulate me on behalf of Xin Nan.

472
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,980
You should investigate and find out.

473
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,980
I will tell you something.

474
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,980
I will tell you something.

475
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,980
I will tell you something.

476
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,980
You can't do that.

477
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,980
Don't tell me.

478
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,980
You can't do that.

479
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,980
I will tell you something.

480
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,980
I will tell you something.

481
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,980
Don't do that to me.

482
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,980
Don't do that to me.

483
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,980
I know you.

484
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,980
I will take care of you.

485
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:08,980
You should take care of me.

486
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,980
It's okay.

487
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,980
It's you.

488
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,980
I will take care of you.

489
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,980
I am sorry.

490
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,980
I hope you will listen to me.

491
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,980
I am sorry.

492
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,980
Don't cry, Aunt Hua.

493
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,980
You have to do something.

494
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,980
Are you crying?

495
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,980
I am fine.

496
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,980
I am Ren Lixi.

497
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,980
I am fine.

498
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,980
I am fine.

499
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:54,980
Ren Lixi, you are so annoying.

500
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,980
You are so annoying.

501
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,980
You are so annoying.

502
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:01,980
I will tell you something.

503
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,980
I am sorry.

504
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,980
I will save you if you are in trouble.

505
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:07,980
Don't bother.

506
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,980
I killed her.

507
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,980
I don't need anyone's help.

508
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,980
What did my wife do?

509
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,980
What does she have to do with these people?

510
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,980
Hua Tuoye killed the victim's shareholder.

511
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,980
She has also committed suicide.

512
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,980
We will send 271 police officers to her house.

513
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,980
After our investigation,

514
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:36,980
Liang Mu Chen has not been suspected of being Hua Tuoye's suspect.

515
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,980
So she is fine now.

516
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,980
She can leave.

517
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,980
Ren Guangxi.

518
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,980
This has nothing to do with Mu Chen.

519
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:51,980
She only came to visit me because she cares about me.

520
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,980
So my wife can leave.

521
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,980
She is fine.

522
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,980
You can leave.

523
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,980
Ren Lixi, you are so annoying.

524
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,980
You are so annoying.

525
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,980
You are so annoying.

526
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,980
You are so annoying.

527
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,980
You are so annoying.

528
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,980
Please.

529
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,980
You have been a murderer for 10 years.

530
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:31,980
Don't worry.

531
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,980
You can't fall down.

532
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:36,980
I will find a way to help Hua Tuoye.

533
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:41,980
Mu Chen, you told me to save her.

534
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,980
You have no choice.

535
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,980
Please help me save her.

536
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,980
I will go.

537
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,980
Don't worry.

538
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,980
It's okay.

539
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,980
Don't worry.

540
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,980
I will go.

541
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,980
Don't worry.

542
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,980
Ren Guangxi.

543
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,980
What should I do?

544
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:26,980
You can't ignore me.

545
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,980
Miss.

546
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:32,980
I want you to change.

547
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:33,980
No matter the behavior.

548
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:34,980
Not even a little.

549
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,980
If you care about me a little.

550
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,980
At least you can change everything you did.

551
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,980
Say it!

552
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,980
I don't want to lie.

553
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,780
I will throw you in the hotel.

554
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,980
Because when I received the call from Bin Zai, he told me that Tu Ye killed Fang Ge.

555
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,480
I didn't know anything.

556
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,980
I didn't know how to tell you.

557
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:55,980
I just wanted to go back and see what he could do for me.

558
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:58,980
The ring ring also cost me half a night.

559
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:01,480
He told me that he needed so much money.

560
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,980
I only knew that Tu Ye took it to save him.

561
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:08,980
I didn't have so much money. I didn't dare to tell you.

562
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,480
I knew that he would take the ring.

563
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,480
But I would definitely take it back.

564
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,980
I was just afraid that you would misunderstand.

565
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:18,980
I didn't expect that you would still misunderstand me and Tu Ye.

566
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:22,980
Every reason you said just now is about Tu Ye.

567
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,980
I don't even know how to believe that you have nothing to do with him.

568
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,480
Is it really that painful to be with me?

569
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,980
He stayed with me.

570
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:31,980
I was going to find him in the room.

571
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,480
Is he really that important?

572
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,980
Yes.

573
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:38,480
He is very important to me.

574
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,980
Have you ever thought that if there is no Tu Ye in the sixth year,

575
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:44,480
what about Xiao Le and I?

576
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,480
He is your son's greatest benefactor.

577
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,980
You can hate me, misunderstand me, and hate me.

578
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:55,480
But I beg you, you must help Tu Ye.

579
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,480
Only you can help him now.

580
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,480
Okay.

581
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:13,480
I promise you that I will help Tu Ye to do something.

582
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,480
Thank you.

583
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,480
Thank you.

584
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,480
But this is the last time.

585
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,480
This is the last time I will do this for you.

586
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,480
I will never forget you.

587
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,480
I will never forget you.

588
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,480
I will never forget you.

589
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,480
I will never forget you.

590
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,480
Okay.

591
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:02,480
I promise you that I will help Tu Ye to do something.

592
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,480
Thank you.

593
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,480
Thank you.

594
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,480
But this is the last time.

595
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:14,480
This is the last time I will do this for you.

596
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,480
We may have met again.

597
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,480
It's not a mistake.

598
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:29,480
I have already accepted your doubt about us.

599
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,480
I have been thinking about it for a long time.

600
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,480
Why did I marry you?

601
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,480
The answer is...

602
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,480
I just want to revenge you.

603
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:49,480
I thought you loved me, so I begged you.

604
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:56,480
Maybe I have a little hope in my heart.

605
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,480
As long as you are with me,

606
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,480
we can go back to the past.

607
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,480
But you let me down again and again.

608
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,480
I will go back to the pain of being like you.

609
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,480
Guang Xin, I will leave you six years ago.

610
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,480
I don't care about the truth.

611
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:22,480
You have even called me...

612
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,480
I have changed.

613
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,480
You have also changed.

614
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,480
We don't love each other anymore.

615
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,480
This marriage makes me very tired.

616
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:49,480
I have been chasing you until now.

617
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,480
But I am tired.

618
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,480
I have been fighting for this relationship for six years.

619
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,480
It's because he treated me well in the past six years.

620
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,480
You are like a family.

621
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,480
I am sorry.

622
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:21,480
This period of time, I will be ready for the marriage.

623
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,480
You and Xiao Le Xin will be together.

624
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:33,480
I will make a deal after the marriage.

625
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,480
I will never forget the hate and the fruit.

626
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,480
I can't escape from love.

627
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,480
The more I live, the more I want to hurt.

628
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,480
The more I live, the more I want to confess.

629
00:50:55,480 --> 00:51:01,480
How to love?

630
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,480
I love him.

631
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,480
I love him.

632
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,480
Xiao Le, if you want to have a date,

633
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,480
can you take him to the hospital?

634
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,480
Don't worry.

635
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,480
I have already told you the truth.

636
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,480
It's okay.

637
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,480
You can talk to him later.

638
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,480
Bye, Xiao Le.

639
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,480
I will be back soon.

640
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,480
Okay, bye.

641
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,480
You have to come here to listen to me.

642
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,480
Let's go.

643
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,480
Okay, bye.

644
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,480
Please wait a minute.

645
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,480
I have to go.

646
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:34,480
I have a surprise for you.

647
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,480
He took the medicine and this wound.

648
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,480
He bought it for me.

649
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,480
Wang Xin?

650
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,480
He knows you are injured.

651
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,480
He can't take a shower.

652
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,480
He is afraid that your wound will hurt.

653
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,480
So he checked the information.

654
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,480
He said that the wound can be removed

655
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,480
and put on the wound.

656
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,480
It can be watered and it won't hurt.

657
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,480
I almost forgot to give you the wound.

658
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,480
I have never seen a young master

659
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,480
use it for more than 20 years.

660
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,480
You can change him.

661
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,480
Make him warmer.

662
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,480
It's really hard.

663
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,480
I can tell that

664
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,480
he really cherishes you.

665
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,480
Don't go too long.

666
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,480
Come back early.

667
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,480
Remember to take the medicine.

668
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,480
Don't let him worry.

669
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,480
Okay.

670
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,480
Here, take a seat.

671
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,480
Sit down.

672
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,480
Why are you wearing shoes?

673
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,480
What's wrong with me?

674
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,480
It's okay.

675
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,480
I just think

676
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,480
that dad treats me well.

677
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,480
You are lying.

678
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,480
After you go out with dad,

679
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,480
dad hasn't come back yet.

680
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,480
You are going to cry.

681
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,480
I'm fine.

682
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,480
I just think

683
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,480
that dad always thinks for me.

684
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,480
But I always misunderstand him.

685
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,480
I never thought about

686
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,480
other things.

687
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:27,480
He would do this

688
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,480
because he cares about me.

689
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,480
But he hurt me so much.

690
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,480
Did you say sorry to him?

691
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,480
I said it.

692
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,480
But dad is so sad.

693
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,480
He doesn't care about me anymore.

694
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,480
Gu Chen.

695
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,480
Let's go to the hospital.

696
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,480
Let's take a photo together.

697
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,480
Why do you suddenly want to take a photo with me?

698
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,480
Dad said that after you get it,

699
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,480
you can try again.

700
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,480
You will succeed.

701
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,480
Gu Chen, you can't give up.

702
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,480
Gary,

703
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:25,480
I told you to find the prescription.

704
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,480
It's not complete.

705
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,480
I have to find the flower print tomorrow.

706
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,480
When I come back,

707
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,480
find the prescription and help me sit on it.

708
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,480
Why are you here?

709
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,480
I got some clothes to change your shoes.

710
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,480
I just went back to the new room to tell mom

711
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,480
that Liang Mu Chen and his mother will move back to Huatian Village.

712
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,480
Didn't you see them?

713
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,480
We broke up.

714
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,480
You should be happy.

715
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:02,480
What's wrong with you?

716
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,480
I mean

717
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,480
you have to be together

718
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,480
because you have such a big heart.

719
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,480
You are always so noisy and mean to your children.

720
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,480
Tell me what's wrong with you.

721
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,480
What do you want to know?

722
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:40,480
You broke up because you couldn't go on?

723
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,480
You want to hear my words?

724
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:46,480
You really didn't get the good result.

725
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,480
I admit

726
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,480
I really failed

727
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,480
because the person in my heart is not me.

728
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,480
It's someone else.

729
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:16,480
Six years ago, he lied to me and left me with the flower.

730
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,480
Six years later, he lied to me like a fool.

731
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,480
No matter how hard I tried to get him,

732
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,480
he was still the same.

733
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,480
He didn't choose me.

734
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,480
But you still love him.

735
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,480
No matter how much you work to make yourself feel better,

736
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,480
you still love him.

737
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,480
No matter how much you tell yourself,

738
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,480
you still love him.

739
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,480
But he doesn't love me.

740
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,480
Did he tell you personally?

741
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,480
He didn't say I knew.

742
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,480
He wanted to save that flower

743
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,480
because he thought he wanted it the most.

744
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,480
But he was always with me.

745
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,480
This is just a story.

746
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,480
This is just a thought you have in your heart.

747
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,480
Guangxi,

748
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,480
have you ever thought

749
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,480
that some people choose to lie to you?

750
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,480
It's because they love each other.

751
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,480
They don't want to hurt each other.

752
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:27,480
And the liar is actually more painful than anyone else.

753
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,480
Have you ever thought that

754
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,480
Liang Mochen might be the reason for this?

755
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,480
What do you think is reasonable?

756
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,480
No one is willing to be cheated, okay?

757
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,480
You think I can't bear it?

758
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,480
Actually, what made me sad the most

759
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,480
is that you don't believe me at all.

760
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,480
So you decided to give up on it?

761
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,480
Have you ever thought that

762
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,480
you can meet again?

763
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,480
There must be different meanings in it.

764
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,480
But not everyone's feelings can be re-entered.

765
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,480
Guangxi,

766
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,480
I really don't want you to be like me

767
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:16,480
for the rest of your life.

768
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,480
Like you?

769
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:22,480
For the rest of your life?

770
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:24,480
I'm not like you.

771
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,480
Don't compare yourself with me, okay?

772
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,480
I let Mochen go because I want her to be better.

773
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,480
I don't want to force her.

774
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,480
I really don't want you to be like me

775
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,480
for the rest of your life.

776
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,480
I'm not like you.

777
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,480
I don't want you to compare yourself with me, okay?

778
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,480
I let Mochen go because I want her to be better.

779
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,480
I don't want to force her.

780
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,480
Don't kill me!

781
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:20,480
Don't kill me!

782
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:22,480
Don't kill me!

783
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,480
Don't kill me!

784
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:26,480
Don't kill me!

785
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,480
I want my dad!

786
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,480
I let him go.

787
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,480
I'm going.

788
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,480
Xiao Lin is waiting for us.

789
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:35,480
Let's go.

790
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,480
Don't kill me!

791
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,480
I want my dad!

792
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,480
I don't want to remember the memories

793
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,480
of childhood,

794
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,480
the memories of the past.

795
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,480
Let go of your dirty hands.

796
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,480
I want my dad.

797
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,480
Let go of my dad!

798
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:00,480
Let go of my dad!

799
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,480
Indeed,

800
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,480
I didn't even take care of my marriage.

801
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,480
I had no right to advise you.

802
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,480
But,

803
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,480
actually,

804
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:39,480
if I tell you,

805
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:42,480
I'll regret it.

806
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,480
What do you mean?

807
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:53,480
I don't regret it.

808
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,480
I also found out that I was wrong.

809
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,480
If I had another chance,

810
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:05,480
I would definitely show you the result.

811
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,480
I would work harder.

812
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,480
So,

813
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,480
actually, I only found out recently,

814
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,480
that in the life of a person,

815
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,480
everything can be given up.

816
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,480
As long as the person you love

817
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:32,480
can be with you,

818
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:34,480
that's enough.

819
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,480
That's the happiest thing.

820
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:45,480
Maybe it's because I'm old,

821
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,480
that I'm still with Xiao Le,

822
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:52,480
that I found out such a simple reason.

823
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,480
I should go.

824
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:01,480
I think you have your own choice.

825
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:05,480
But, to be honest,

826
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,480
I really like that child.

827
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,480
I hope that

828
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,480
with this chance,

829
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,480
with this fate,

830
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,480
I can continue to be his family.

831
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,480
I'm leaving.

832
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:47,480
I'm leaving.

833
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:50,480
Gary,

834
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:52,480
I want you to help me collect the information.

835
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,480
About the incident of my father's suicide in 20 years.

836
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:58,480
Okay.

837
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,480
I'm leaving.

838
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:19,480
I'm afraid that he's been two weeks now.

839
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,480
Although the divorce is not possible because of the marriage,

840
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:24,480
the witness who found out

841
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,480
that Hua Zhixing and Yang Tianfu,

842
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,480
had already said that Hua Tuwei had killed someone.

843
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:30,480
And,

844
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,480
Hua Tuwei had enough criminal motive.

845
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,480
He admitted that he was the one who killed her.

846
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:38,480
So, the prosecutor,

847
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,480
has already committed a murder,

848
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:41,480
and has sued him.

849
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:42,480
Murder?

850
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,480
But, Zhixing said,

851
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,480
that it was Fang Ke who hurt Master Tuwei.

852
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,480
Master Tuwei was forced to resist,

853
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:50,480
and he would hurt Master Fang.

854
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,480
Is this saying helpful to Master Tuwei?

855
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,480
I can only say that he is a criminal.

856
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,480
But, it doesn't matter now.

857
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,480
The most important thing is that

858
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,480
Hua Tuwei doesn't want me to help him.

859
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,480
The end of the month is about to start.

860
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:07,480
There's not enough time.

861
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:08,480
And, in the police station,

862
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,480
he doesn't want to be his behavior at all.

863
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:13,480
It's very dangerous.

864
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,480
I don't know why I'm afraid of you.

865
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:22,480
Lawyer Ren,

866
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,480
I can't tell you what I'm afraid of.

867
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,480
I'm afraid that you'll be in trouble.

868
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:31,480
I'm a criminal.

869
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:33,480
I'm Hua Zhixing's son.

870
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:34,480
I'm afraid that I'll be in trouble.

871
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:38,480
I don't want to be afraid of you.

872
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,480
Hua Yi, don't worry.

873
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,480
I'll go to the police station to find Hua Tuwei.

874
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,480
What you should do now is to take good care of yourself.

875
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:52,480
Otherwise, what will happen when Hua Tuwei comes back?

876
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,480
Don't worry.

877
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:03,480
Hua Yi will stay here before Zhixing comes back.

878
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,480
I'll take good care of him.

879
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:15,480
I'll go to the police station to find Hua Tuwei.

880
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:38,480
After the court,

881
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:39,480
you'll be the witness.

882
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:41,480
After the incident,

883
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,480
you're the one who connected Hua Tuwei to the first person.

884
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,480
And you also know why he will be held accountable.

885
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,480
And your relationship with Hua,

886
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,480
maybe you can provide some positive evidence.

887
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:01,480
Since you're here,

888
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,480
why don't you stay for a while and wait for Xiao Le to come back?

889
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:12,480
Since you're here,

890
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,320
why don't you stay for a while

891
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:15,480
and wait for Xiao Le to come back?

892
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,480
Xiao Le visited Tangtang Restaurant.

893
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,160
Tangtang℃ has birthday today,

894
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,480
so her mum has to celebrate with her strong heart.

895
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:22,480
Tangtang is on holiday today.

896
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,480
So her mom wants to celebrate.

897
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:25,420
So she's going to pick up her daughter

898
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:27,480
and do some family business.

899
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,480
I'm worried if the house on or the rooftop

900
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:34,480
we can be haunted by someone's parents

901
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:35,200
will갑enandstardery pytanie 我改想れ

902
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,080
All the糾金

903
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:37,480
who are soons and dim autistic

904
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:40,480
Xiao Le went to Tangtang's house. Tangtang's birthday is today.

905
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,480
So her mother helped her to hold a birthday party.

906
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:45,480
She'll be back soon.

907
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,480
I think you haven't seen each other for a long time.

908
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:51,480
If Xiao Le sees you, she'll be very happy.

909
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:57,480
Sorry. I also want to see Xiao Le.

910
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:00,480
But I have to go find Hua Tuoy.

911
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:03,480
The meeting will be over soon.

912
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,480
Let's talk after the meeting.

913
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:09,480
It's not happy.

914
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:29,480
Hello, Dad.

915
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,480
Me too.

916
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:33,480
You must have brought him to the hospital.

917
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:36,480
You're right. You're also a hero.

918
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,480
I'll try my best.

919
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,480
But Xiao Le, you have to be obedient.

920
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,480
You're taking care of Hua Ying and Hueng Lei.

921
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:47,480
So don't be too bold and let her be calm.

922
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,480
Xiao Le, you're obedient.

923
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:51,480
After Dad's meeting,

924
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,480
we'll have a carrot and beef rice.

925
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:55,480
I'll give you two a treat.

926
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:58,480
Dad, have a meal with me.

927
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:01,480
Sure. I'll see you later.

928
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:03,480
Okay.

929
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,480
I'm going to find Duan Zai.

930
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:13,480
Dad, don't forget that I'm a good mother to you.

931
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:34,480
I'll come with you.

932
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:04,480
We're not going to be married.

933
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,480
I'll go.

934
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:09,480
I'll come with you.

935
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,480
Your mother asked me to be your guardian.

936
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,480
As long as you agree.

937
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:25,480
I don't need a lawyer.

938
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:28,480
I just want to meet you because

939
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,480
I want to know the current situation of Chi Xin

940
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:32,480
He is being forced to be a hot-blooded girl

941
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,480
I'll go to see him

942
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,480
I'll ask him what happened that night

943
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,480
Why did you go to ask him those questions?

944
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,480
Don't you think he's miserable enough?

945
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,480
Don't bother him again

946
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:59,480
I'm just worried that because Chi Xin was forced to be a hot-blooded girl

947
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:01,480
You went to ask him some questions

948
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:03,480
You asked him those questions

949
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:06,480
Do you think he's able to bear the consequences?

950
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:08,480
Don't worry

951
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:10,480
I'll go to see him

952
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,480
Don't worry

953
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,480
I have a share in the matter

954
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,480
The most important thing is your relationship

955
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:19,480
I don't need your help

956
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:21,480
I can tell the police that you're a hostage

957
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:24,480
I'm a hostage, I'll cut you off

958
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,480
You just have to tell me the truth

959
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,480
It's very simple

960
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:30,480
I killed the person

961
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:33,480
It has nothing to do with anyone else

962
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:35,480
You don't have to explain yourself

963
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:37,480
You just have to admit your crime

964
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:41,480
It has nothing to do with anyone else

965
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,480
Your attitude

966
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,480
makes me feel that this matter is not simple

967
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:04,480
Excuse me

968
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:07,480
The lawyer of the law firm of Hua Tuwei is a witness

969
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,480
I'd like to see if the lawyer of the law firm

970
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:12,480
who has been guilty of the crime of stealing the rights of the whole family

971
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:15,480
Is he as powerful as the one in the media?

972
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:16,480
I don't think so

973
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,480
I don't know why Mu Chen left you

974
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:21,480
What do you mean?

975
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:25,480
Six years ago, if your mother didn't ask her to leave you

976
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:27,480
Mu Chen wanted you to accept the contract

977
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:28,480
to save you

978
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,480
and ask you to accept the contract

979
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,480
He wanted me to lie to you

980
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,480
You're a lawyer

981
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,480
You're a simple person

982
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:37,480
You can't even think of the answer

983
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:41,480
Liang Xiaole, what's the 8th letter of the letter?

984
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,480
I'm hungry

985
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:44,480
I'm hungry

986
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:47,480
Listen to me, your mother is right

987
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,480
It's also her mother

988
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,480
I know her very well

989
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:55,480
I know where I belong

990
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,480
I know where I belong

991
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,480
I know where I belong

992
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,480
You're the one who's actually the one

993
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,480
We're childhood friends

994
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,480
We're not related

995
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:09,480
I hope you don't give up on this marriage

996
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,480
You'll get married for yourself

997
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:15,480
I really don't know

998
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:17,480
How to get close to you

999
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,480
Really?

1000
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,480
Liang Xiaole

1001
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,480
You should be a assistant

1002
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:26,480
You should be a parent

1003
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,480
Come here

1004
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,480
You're a lawyer

1005
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:31,480
You're a lawyer

1006
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:32,480
You're a lawyer

1007
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:33,480
You're a lawyer

1008
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:34,480
Liang Xiaole

1009
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:37,480
This is the letter I want to give you

1010
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:40,480
What's the matter?

1011
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:41,480
You're a lawyer

1012
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,480
I'm not a child

1013
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,480
But I want to confess to you

1014
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:04,480
I just want to be loved by you

1015
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:07,480
Suddenly I want to love

1016
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:10,480
The most cruel confession

1017
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,480
Like a falling foot

1018
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:16,480
I'm comfortable

1019
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,480
I'm used to it

1020
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,480
I'm used to it

1021
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:23,480
Suddenly I understand

1022
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:28,480
That it was love

1023
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,480
My, my

1024
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,480
You are my love

1025
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:35,480
I owe everything to you

1026
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:36,480
Too much nothing

1027
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:52,480
Not enough

1028
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:59,480
I can't wait to be in love

1029
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:03,480
I want to be in love

1030
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:08,480
I should be like this
