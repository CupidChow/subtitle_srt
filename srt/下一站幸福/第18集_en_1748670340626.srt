1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The people in the world are all criticizing you.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Remember, your family will not leave you.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I can't believe you said that.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Of course.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Mother.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I didn't know you were not home.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You were singing with Fang.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What should I do?

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You are a fool.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You are so good looking.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You have someone who can share your story.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You have to cherish it.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This child is like a child in a dream.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
If you want, you can start from him.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I found many things that I didn't change.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I was still a child in the sixth year.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But you still don't know me.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I am still a child in the sixth year.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Is Xiaolai asleep?

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Go find him.

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I am not sleeping.

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What's wrong?

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Nothing.

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What was that sound?

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What's wrong with you?

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I was in the room.

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Open the door.

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Open the door and talk.

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What's wrong?

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I can't take off my clothes.

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I will get hurt.

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Let me help you.

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Help me find Zha Ma.

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Zha Ma is already asleep.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
We are married.

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Don't bother her.

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You will feel fine, but you will feel no face.

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
We have Xiaole.

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I don't know what you are thinking.

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Six years have passed.

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I still remember everything I have done to you.

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I will close my eyes.

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You hold my hand and take off your clothes.

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Hurry up.

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You are a normal man.

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You can't do anything.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I don't know how long I can last.

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Help me pull this side.

49
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Where?

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Up here.

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Up here?

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes.

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Like this?

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I will take off my clothes.

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I will pull it from your side.

57
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Like this?

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Look at your face.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Be careful.

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Like this?

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes.

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You can help me pull this side.

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Do you hear me?

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yes.

66
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Hurry up.

67
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yes.

68
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Renzi.

69
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What's wrong?

70
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Are you okay?

71
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Hello?

72
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Hi, Mu-chen.

73
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I... I... I didn't see you.

74
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I have something to tell you.

75
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What's wrong?

76
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I... I... I... I...

77
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I... I... I...

78
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I... I... I... I...

79
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I... I... I... I...

80
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I... I...

81
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Aunt Hua, I don't understand what you mean.

82
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Mu-chen, you... You...

83
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What's wrong?

84
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Aunt Hua, what's wrong? Why are you so sudden?

85
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I told you.

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I just saw you in the city.

87
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You were eating a lot.

88
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I was going to the zoo. I was going to the library.

89
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I told you I was a kid.

90
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I didn't tell you.

91
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I was just kidding.

92
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Mu-chen, I told you.

93
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I... I was going to a hotel.

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I was going to a dentist.

95
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I was going to a dentist. I saw you in the library.

96
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I knew you were a kid.

97
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But...

98
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I was just kidding.

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Ms. Hua.

100
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Aunt Hua.

101
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Just give me the medicine.

102
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You're so considerate. She's very happy.

103
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
This is the most important care for the patient.

104
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Besides,

105
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
she's still a little girl.

106
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You... You should have come here.

107
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Mu-chen, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

108
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
No.

109
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Tuoyue is very important to me.

110
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
No matter what, I won't care about her.

111
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Don't worry. I'll think of a way to get the money.

112
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'll give you a discount tomorrow.

113
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Bye-bye.

114
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Thank you.

115
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
By the way, do you want to sleep early?

116
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Or do you want to help the Lawyer's Congress tomorrow?

117
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
How is the Lawyer's Congress?

118
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's important to you.

119
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The Lawyer's Congress

120
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Dad, why did I have you on the phone?

121
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I...

122
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's because I did a good thing.

123
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So I wrote it on the phone.

124
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's a good person.

125
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Dad.

126
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Tuoyue.

127
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Okay, thank you.

128
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Is it a lawyer?

129
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Did he tell you about the matter with Ms. Wu?

130
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
He said that some of his friends in the Lawyer's Congress

131
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
were very supportive of what I did.

132
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So the Congress decided not to punish me.

133
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But it was not a big deal.

134
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Great.

135
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'll find Ms. Wu later.

136
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Xiaole, are you done?

137
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'll take you to class.

138
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Mu Chen, let's go together.

139
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Xiaole.

140
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Mu Chen just said that he'd come to see me.

141
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So I'll take you there.

142
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Come on, let's go.

143
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Actually, I can go with you.

144
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Then I'll find Ms. Wu.

145
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
No need.

146
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You go and take care of yourself.

147
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Dad, I'm done.

148
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Okay, let's go.

149
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Dad, are you happy?

150
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
No.

151
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
When you were in the car,

152
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Brother Ying, you were all singing with me.

153
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You usually sing with me.

154
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Xiaole.

155
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You know that you feel like

156
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
you don't know how to get along with someone.

157
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Because you don't know what he thinks.

158
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You don't know what he thinks.

159
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You can ask him.

160
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Not every thing can be asked.

161
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Sometimes you worry that

162
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
his answer is not what you want.

163
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Otherwise, you'll be very upset.

164
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I asked Mu Chen.

165
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I want cake.

166
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Mu Chen didn't give me food.

167
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Forget it.

168
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Let's go.

169
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Dad, have you heard of

170
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
the story of the North Wind and the Sun?

171
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Yes.

172
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Mu Chen said that the North Wind is made of bamboo.

173
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
There are more trees and trees.

174
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And the sun is shining in the North Wind.

175
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But there are more trees.

176
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I've heard of this story.

177
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
But I'm not from the North Wind.

178
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You are?

179
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm not.

180
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm a smart worker.

181
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm a strong worker.

182
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Xiaole, don't talk nonsense.

183
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Let's go.

184
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
We're late.

185
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm not late.

186
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm not late.

187
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Don't you like Mu Chen?

188
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Don't you like him?

189
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Why do you like me?

190
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Don't you like Mu Chen?

191
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Say it.

192
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Don't you like him?

193
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Xiaole.

194
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Say it.

195
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Xiaole.

196
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Look at the plane.

197
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Don't lie to me.

198
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Don't you like Mu Chen?

199
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Say it.

200
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Don't you like him?

201
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Don't you like him?

202
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Okay, Xiaole.

203
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'll tell you the answer after you get off.

204
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Let's go.

205
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
We're late.

206
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I don't like Mu Chen.

207
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm sure you like Mu Chen.

208
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I like him.

209
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I know you like him forever.

210
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Okay, go to class.

211
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm sure you like Mu Chen.

212
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I like him.

213
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Miss Liang, I'm sorry.

214
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You're in our bank account.

215
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And you're not fully paid.

216
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm sorry.

217
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I can't provide your loan service.

218
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Boss.

219
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You have to pay attention to your wife's movements.

220
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
She's taking your wedding ring

221
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
and standing in front of the bank.

222
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Get in the bank right now.

223
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Normally,

224
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
someone actually falls.

225
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
She moved her to the bank

226
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
before I moved her.

227
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I suppose she wants to take her money.

228
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
But, in fact,

229
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I clearly see the past two.

230
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's not that obvious.

231
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's not something,

232
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
but like a ring.

233
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
For example,

234
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
the punkt in the bank

235
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
is promising that

236
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Cha21 driven coincidences

237
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
For example, the key ring

238
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Boss, don't think too much

239
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
According to the communication records, the wife and the father-in-law passed the phone call that night

240
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
But sometimes, when you talk to the old neighbor and care about the day

241
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
There's nothing wrong

242
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Boss, don't be so anxious. These two things don't have anything to do with it

243
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Don't talk nonsense

244
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
The wife's husband also went to the shop after he went to the shop

245
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
The owner is the real flower gardener

246
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And the mother of the flower gardener also marked the flower gardener's account

247
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I heard that the villagers gave the flower gardener the opportunity

248
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Boss, don't be so anxious

249
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You said the woman was very strange

250
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
A few days ago, she was with me in the park, holding a small bird

251
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
She helped me apologize and hit me

252
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
But two days later, she hit the ring and took it to another man

253
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Don't you think she's strange?

254
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
She's a woman. How do you know what she's thinking?

255
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Boss, I can see that you're really in love with Kun Ruan now

256
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
How could that be? I used to be a student in the university

257
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's good that you don't mention the old days. Your time has passed

258
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Think about it. You've only been busy with work for the past six years

259
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
There's only one woman around you

260
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Just now, one woman is the woman who only wants to pay and doesn't want to repay

261
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
That means you're not good at love

262
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Look at you now. You're like a love-hate

263
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You're not the only man

264
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Be serious with me

265
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
But you have a little kid who's five years old

266
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That's the problem. You're married and have children

267
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
People are married from this age to the last child

268
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
They're into the cold period

269
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
But you're starting from the cold period

270
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
This is too complicated

271
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You need to return to the world of two people

272
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And start the most simple love

273
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
That's good, boss. I've got you a case

274
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Since you helped Lihua to settle the case, you've been improving

275
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Now you have a name you just came back from abroad

276
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You just need to help her get divorced

277
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
In order to be a good husband, she asked you to take her to the beach villa in Xiatah to meet up

278
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
To the beach villa?

279
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
That's the point. The view is beautiful and the atmosphere is good

280
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You can take your wife to the beach villa to sleep

281
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Besides, I know Lihuan's private life

282
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It's the first marriage of this marriage

283
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
This woman is like a tiger

284
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Or you can't go to the beach alone

285
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Or you can't go to the beach with your wife

286
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You're going to give me a divorce?

287
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm afraid she'll push me to another woman

288
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Boss, I don't know what happened between you

289
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But I think you're too pessimistic

290
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I think you should give each other more trust

291
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Trust is mutual

292
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
If you trust each other first, you might find that many things are different

293
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Anyway, this is amusic

294
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
After traveling through this hidden road, there's already been the most happy moments

295
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
The princess and princess

296
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Most of them are

297
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
But sometimes the princess and prince

298
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Will quarrel

299
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
But because the story is too few

300
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So I didn't write it out

301
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Like Mu Chen

302
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
After the relationship with him

303
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
He's not smiling anymore

304
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Are you unhappy?

305
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Mu Chen

306
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
If you don't happy

307
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
We can go back to the flower village

308
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Mu Chen is very happy

309
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Just Mu Chen and dad

310
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Sometimes they don't feel happy

311
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Will quarrel

312
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
But don't worry

313
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
We will be happy like the princess and prince

314
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You

315
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Why don't you go to sleep

316
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
The wife of the princess will come to find Xiao Le

317
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I think you should trust each other more

318
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Trust is mutual

319
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
If you trust each other first

320
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You will find many things are different

321
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Lin Nan

322
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I made some rice for you

323
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You said it's too much

324
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It's not serious

325
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Where's your ring?

326
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I didn't wear it

327
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Today?

328
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I will help Chen Ma clean this afternoon

329
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
She will take it down if she is busy

330
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
That's better

331
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
But I forgot where to put it

332
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I will find it out later

333
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Don't bother

334
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's so late

335
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
But tomorrow

336
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I need you to go out with me

337
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Two days and a night

338
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Why are you so surprised?

339
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
This client is very important

340
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's work and social

341
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You are my wife

342
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You should go

343
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Is there a problem?

344
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
What do I need to prepare?

345
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
No need

346
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You just have to be a good wife

347
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I don't want others to think about our relationship

348
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So I ask you to wear the ring

349
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You will wear it

350
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I will find it out tomorrow morning

351
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You won't lie to me, right?

352
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I can trust you

353
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Webster

354
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Money

355
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
mature

356
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
You have to be obedient

357
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,300
Also, please call your mom to help you

358
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,500
She's asking for your help

359
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,000
It's my duty, don't be angry

360
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,500
Okay, Mu Zhe, you have a lot to say

361
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,500
Also, you have to do it on time

362
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,000
Don't take the last second of the ceremony to report to the police

363
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,500
I don't want to report to the police, I want to buy the products

364
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,000
You guys go out and play

365
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Remember to buy the products for me

366
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,500
Of course, call me when you have something to do

367
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Bye

368
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,500
Bye

369
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Where are you?

370
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You're here

371
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Let's go.

372
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Excuse me.

373
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
The most famous restaurant is their child.

374
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
It's quite interesting to come here at night.

375
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
How does it sound?

376
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
The facilities of this restaurant are very familiar.

377
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It feels like you're on a vacation.

378
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Unlike the next day's work.

379
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Or else...

380
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
This client doesn't need to be very formal.

381
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Besides, I only look at these materials.

382
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I'm afraid you'll be bored when I'm at work.

383
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Don't think too much.

384
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
You look different today.

385
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
What?

386
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I feel...

387
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
It's like I'm back to the day I first met you.

388
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Do you want to meet Mr. Ren?

389
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Mr. Alice is here. Please come with me.

390
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I won't be long. You go first.

391
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Excuse me.

392
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Hello.

393
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
You...

394
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Qiqi?

395
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Apple?

396
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Ren Guangxi.

397
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I'm kidding.

398
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
How could I forget you?

399
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
But why are you here?

400
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I'm here to see you.

401
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I'm here to see you.

402
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
But why are you here?

403
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I'm not here.

404
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I'm your client.

405
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Surprise.

406
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You're my client?

407
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I think my wife doesn't need to wait for me.

408
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Wife?

409
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Yes.

410
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Besides, you just met her.

411
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
You're my client.

412
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I'm here to see you.

413
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I'm sorry.

414
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I'm sorry.

415
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I'm sorry.

416
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I'm sorry.

417
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I'm sorry.

418
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm sorry.

419
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I'm sorry.

420
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
So I have to protect you.

421
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Although she's a special person,

422
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I need to know who she is.

423
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Do you know how to do it?

424
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I thought you were interested.

425
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I got divorced with my first husband.

426
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I changed my previous lawyer.

427
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I believe you can help me get a better treatment.

428
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Because...

429
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
No one knows you better than me.

430
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I didn't expect you to be more attractive in the past six years.

431
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
But...

432
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
You've never seen women before.

433
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
This is the information you need this time.

434
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Let's talk about it later.

435
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I think it's better if you talk to me

436
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
when you're with me.

437
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Why don't you come to my room?

438
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
It's more secretive.

439
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
No one will disturb you.

440
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
You can talk to me later.

441
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
No one will disturb you.

442
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I'm going back to my room.

443
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Mo Chen.

444
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I'll help my husband with the business.

445
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I'll help my husband with the business.

446
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
You've been a doctor for a long time.

447
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Do you want to drink some?

448
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Isn't this your favorite?

449
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
You still remember?

450
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Yes.

451
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I've never changed my favorite taste.

452
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
My favorite man is the same.

453
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Can you help me?

454
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Honey, it's good that you can talk about it.

455
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
It's okay if your wife gets it done.

456
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
No need.

457
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
We'll talk later.

458
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I'll go to your room.

459
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Don't worry.

460
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Miss Jiang.

461
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
When you go to our room,

462
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I'll help you with the rest.

463
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I'll call you back.

464
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I'll be back.

465
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I'll be back.

466
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I'll be back.

467
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I'll be back.

468
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I'll be back.

469
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I'll see you later.

470
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Mr. Ren's room is an independent villa.

471
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
It's a high-end room.

472
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
We've checked that there are no dogs.

473
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
You can have a rest and talk.

474
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Mr. Ren's room is the biggest 2-Kream bedroom.

475
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
There's enough space and equipment

476
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
to provide a space for the meeting.

477
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Wait.

478
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
2-Kream bedroom.

479
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
What marriage?

480
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
It's a show.

481
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Hello, Guangxi.

482
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
We haven't met for so long.

483
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Do you want to have dinner with me?

484
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I'll treat you to dinner.

485
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
You're the one who helped me with the wedding.

486
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
You heard that?

487
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Auntie wants to treat us to dinner.

488
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
So, get ready.

489
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Get ready?

490
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Do I need to get ready?

491
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I think he just wants to have dinner with you.

492
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
You mean you're jealous?

493
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
You're overthinking.

494
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I just don't understand

495
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
why you're so stubborn.

496
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Zhang Yu is just an old friend.

497
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
No matter what,

498
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I knew you first.

499
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
You're the third person who's been in love.

500
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
The third person?

501
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Who's the first and who's the last?

502
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Why did you contact Hua Tuoye?

503
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
You even got married with him.

504
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I've been friends with Tuoye.

505
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I promised him that I'd get married

506
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
because you forced me.

507
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
You're the one who needs to fight with me.

508
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Really?

509
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Why did you tell me all this?

510
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
You look like a cat.

511
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

512
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I remember you used to hit me with a tie.

513
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Who really wanted to investigate you that morning?

514
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
That was your first time wearing a suit.

515
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I still don't know how to tie it.

516
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I don't think I need anyone to help you.

517
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I'm not sure.

518
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I'm not sure.

519
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I don't think I need anyone to help me.

520
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I'm just a little bit worried.

521
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I don't need anyone to help you.

522
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Have you heard of that?

523
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
The reason why men can't learn is

524
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
because they're waiting for a girl to play with them.

525
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Maybe I haven't learned how to tie a tie for so many years.

526
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
That's why I'm waiting for you.

527
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I'm sorry.

528
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I must have told you how much we've been through.

529
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
What did you two adults do?

530
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
You let the child out of the house by yourself.

531
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
If Gary hadn't told you, I...

532
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Enough. I'm not talking to you.

533
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I have to get the truth out of you.

534
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I'll help you.

535
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
How could you do that?

536
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Can you use a knife?

537
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I can.

538
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I know that

539
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
you can't eat anything with high calories.

540
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And you can't eat salt and gold.

541
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I've waited for you in the chamber for so long.

542
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
You're the same as me.

543
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I'm going to beat my hands today.

544
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Why?

545
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I haven't helped you with your stomach.

546
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I can't say that I have to share my burden with you.

547
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Where's the pain?

548
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I'm fine. I'm fine.

549
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Just be safe.

550
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
It's so comfortable to be cool.

551
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
You're so young.

552
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
You must be a very old woman.

553
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
How could you be so considerate?

554
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
You're very like me.

555
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Like me?

556
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Who told you that?

557
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Mo Chen.

558
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
She told you about me?

559
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
She used to be a little bit of a loser.

560
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I've told you that

561
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I love to help my parents.

562
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
And I've done so many things for them.

563
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I'm the best mom in the world.

564
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I love you.

565
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
How was your life in Huatian Village?

566
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
It was great.

567
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
It was so beautiful.

568
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
The buildings were so nice.

569
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
So, how are you doing?

570
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Do you want to live there?

571
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I don't want to move back there.

572
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I want to be taken back by my dad.

573
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Why?

574
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Because Mo Chen took care of me.

575
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
He wanted to grow flowers and sell milk.

576
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
He wanted to work in Grandpa's office.

577
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I don't like him being so busy.

578
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Didn't you hear that there's a person named Huatuo

579
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
who's taking care of you?

580
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
He's my brother-in-law.

581
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Mo Chen doesn't like to trouble others.

582
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
When I was sick,

583
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
when he was sick,

584
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
he would call a cab to help.

585
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
If that's the case,

586
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Sun Hongcheng will be looking after him.

587
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I love him...

588
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Don't pretend to be stubborn.

589
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
My heart?

590
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
There's no tomorrow...

591
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So,

592
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Sun Hongcheng will be looking after him?

593
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Okay.

594
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,200
There are only people

595
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,440
who are tough cabbage.

596
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,200
Then your homework

597
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,240
have you done your homework?

598
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,540
If you really want to be like me

599
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,900
your homework is always very good

600
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
That's why I can laugh

601
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,500
I often do a class

602
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,500
I want to go to the Santa's with my family

603
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,500
What's the Santa's?

604
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,500
Forget it

605
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Anyway, dad and mom are not here

606
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,500
I don't want to do class either

607
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,500
How can you not do class?

608
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I'll take you there

609
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,500
Grandpa, grandpa, I'm going to study in the school

610
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I'll take you there

611

Grandpa, grandpa, grandpa

00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
You once said you didn't want to be with him

633
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Let me know

634
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
You treat him

635
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
So well

636
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000

But, Grandpa

I regret

667
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,000
In the first place, it is mycono

668
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
If you sayiques

669
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I will pay you back

670
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I don't care

671
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,440
He said very very living things

672
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:22,760
He said noMo

673
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:38,400
Mo Zi He played with his redundancy

674
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,400
How can I love a father?

675
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,400
I...

676
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,400
I'm a bit selfish.

677
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,400
Sorry.

678
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,400
I was wrong.

679
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,400
I'm happy now.

680
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,400
I'm really sorry.

681
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,400
You must have broken my heart.

682
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,400
I love my father.

683
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,400
I love my mother.

684
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,400
I love you too.

685
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,400
I love my mother.

686
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,400
I'm sorry.

687
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,400
You're not happy.

688
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,400

Don't wake up.

698
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,400
Hello.

699
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,400
Do you want to read the book?

700
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,400
No one can read the book.

701
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,400
You've been reading the book for so many nights.

702
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,400
You're making me look like a flower.

703
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,400
Just print it out.

704
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,400
When we have dinner,

705
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,400
explain it to me.

706
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,400
Okay?

707
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,400
Okay.

708
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,400
I'm going to the Business Center in the building.

709
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,400
I'll print out the address.

710
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,400
Wait for me in the room.

711
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,400
Are you ready?

712
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,400
Let's go eat.

713
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,400
I just got the information about the camp.

714
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,400
I haven't come back yet.

715
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,400
It's okay.

716
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,400
Let's wait a little longer.

717
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,400
You're the one.

718
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,400
I'm a high-class restaurant.

719
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,400
Why are you dressed like you used to be?

720
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,400
I'm a Bodhisattva.

721
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,400
I'm a Bodhisattva.

722
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,400
Bodhisattva?

723
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,400
You don't even have a similar outfit.

724
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,400
Even if you don't show me your face,

725
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,400
you should think about it for Guangxi.

726
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,400
Look at yourself.

727
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,400
You look like you're in a wedding.

728
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,400
You're going to a high-class restaurant like this.

729
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,400
But I only have this outfit.

730
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,400
Forget it.

731
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,400
I have some clothes in my room.

732
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,400
Before you take Guangxi back,

733
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,400
you can go to change your clothes with me.

734
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,400
Let's go.

735
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,400
The next day

736
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,400
Is anyone out there?

737
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,400
Open the door for me.

738
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,400
Loutie...

739
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,400
Alright, get up.

740
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,400
Don't move.

741
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,400
Mo Chen.

742
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,400
Damn it.

743
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,400
Ji Huang.

744
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,400
I'm sorry.

745
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,400
Have you seen Mo Chen?

746
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,400
No.

747
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,400
What's wrong?

748
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,400
She's not in her room. She's not answering the phone.

749
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,400
She's a woman. She might go shopping.

750
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,400
I've looked for her.

751
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,400
Then go to the salon or the park to walk.

752
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,400
I've looked for her.

753
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,400
What's wrong with her?

754
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,400
I'm sorry.

755
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,400
Why is she so troublesome?

756
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,400
I'm sorry.

757
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,400
I'm sorry.

758
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,400
Have a seat.

759
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,400
Guang Qi, don't be sad.

760
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,400
I know you two are booked for two-bedroom rooms.

761
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,400
I can see through your husband and sister-in-law.

762
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,400
You're just like a shoe.

763
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,400
You lose it when you're not in the right time.

764
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,400
You're not like me.

765
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,400
A girl with a lot of money can't change her clothes.

766
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,400
This restaurant is famous.

767
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,400
Your wife doesn't want you.

768
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,400
It's her loss.

769
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,400
Have some.

770
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,400
I often think that if time can pass,

771
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,400
if everything can come back,

772
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,400
I think we'll be different.

773
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,400
I can't forget you.

774
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,400
That's why I'm looking for you in different husbands.

775
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,400
You're really a good girl.

776
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,400
I didn't expect that you're even more important than my wife.

777
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,400
Yes.

778
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,400
Don't waste your time on a woman who doesn't love you.

779
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,400
Do you really think I'm looking for you for this divorce?

780
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,400
No. 313, the police have sent out the report.

781
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,400
The system has started. Please check it.

782
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,400
Who are you?

783
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,400
Why are you in the room?

784
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,400
So you're the one who burned the towel in the room.

785
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,400
Miss, you're so messy.

786
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,400
Do you think you don't have time to clean the room?

787
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,400
You're so pretty.

788
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,400
You're so pretty.

789
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,400
You're so pretty.

790
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,400
You're so pretty.

791
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,400
Do you think you don't have time to clean the room?

792
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,400
You're the one who's the most dangerous.

793
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,400
Why are you looking at me like that?

794
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,400
It's not like that. I'm not in a mood to look at you.

795
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,400
I always think that

796
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:02,400
some things are more important than my relationship with Qian Feng.

797
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,400
I have a bad habit.

798
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,400
I've never changed.

799
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,400
This is the first time I've played with a husband.

800
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,400
Do you think your wife is the reason you're getting divorced?

801
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,400
She's not just a woman. She's also a liar.

802
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,400
The most important thing in a husband is his faith.

803
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,400
If he's willing to be a burden,

804
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,400
I can give him another chance.

805
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,400
But he's not sick.

806
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,400
He's not sick.

807
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,400
But I think that this is the arrangement that God gave me.

808
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,400
I can give him another chance.

809
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,400
Another chance?

810
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,400
What are you doing?

811
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,400
What are you doing?

812
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,400
You said that you'd be divorced with a lawyer.

813
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,400
If you were to be exposed and have a relationship with a lawyer,

814
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,400
I wouldn't ask you that.

815
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,400
You'd be in a relationship with a lawyer.

816
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,400
Do you think I'd let you get divorced?

817
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,400
Who wants to see the truth?

818
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,400
You're the one who loves to see these pictures.

819
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,400
You want to sue me?

820
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,400
Fine.

821
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,400
Then I can say that you're a ghost.

822
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,400
You can write it.

823
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,400
But don't put me in the picture.

824
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,400
Who is it?

825
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,400
I'm Ren Guangxi.

826
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,400
Just now, Miss Zhang Ai Li deliberately locked me up.

827
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,400
To know that I'd have a chance to be with my husband.

828
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,400
Miss Zhang, six years ago,

829
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,400
you chose to help me to get rid of Guangxi.

830
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,400
Six years later, you locked me up to seduce Guangxi.

831
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,400
Why did you use such a lock?

832
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,400
Do you have a new way?

833
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,400
How could you not see it clearly?

834
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:05,400
Six years ago, you chose the same way to hurt me.

835
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:09,400
But I didn't expect that we'd be closer.

836
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,400
You should reflect on your marriage.

837
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,400
Why do you always lose your mind?

838
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,400
It's not because you don't love others.

839
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,400
Do you think that such a strong war can have true love?

840
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,400
Maybe you failed your marriage four times.

841
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,400
The biggest reason is that you're not married.

842
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:30,400
Because you never know how to cherish the people around you.

843
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,400
If you want to write, just write this.

844
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,400
Now I want to go back to Paris with my husband.

845
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,400
Wait.

846
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,400
Can my wife give me back my phone?

847
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,400
If you need it, I can help you get rid of the lock.

848
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,400
It's free.

849
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:54,400
Because you've already made me see how brave a woman is to protect her husband.

850
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,400
This picture is very precious.

851
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,400
I thought you were really looking for her.

852
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,400
I didn't mean to.

853
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,400
I'm sorry. I came early.

854
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:27,400
I didn't mean to waste your time with you and Zhang Ai Li.

855
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,400
What you said in front of me just now

856
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,400
should have been a good thing.

857
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,400
Is that true?

858
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,400
I'm serious.

859
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,400
But do you care about me?

860
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,400
You don't care at all.

861
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,400
You just treat her as a joke.

862
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,400
Do you really think so?

863
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,400
Don't remind me.

864
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,400
I know my identity very well.

865
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,400
I'm not a bad mother.

866
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,400
I know you don't care about me.

867
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,400
The reason why we are together

868
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,400
is because you want to take revenge on me.

869
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,400
You have to take revenge until you're satisfied.

870
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,400
We left the hospital that day.

871
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,400
We were together.

872
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:21,400
I thought we could go back to the past.

873
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,400
I told myself that maybe in this marriage

874
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,400
I can work harder.

875
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:32,400
But if you just want me to be a good mother to Xiao Le

876
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,400
and you can leave me alone

877
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,400
like this,

878
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,400
you can let me stay by Xiao Le's side.

879
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,400
That way I'll be more free.

880
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,400
Why haven't you said those words before?

881
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,400
Do you care?

882
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,400
Do you know that I'm scared and careful

883
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,400
when I'm with you every day?

884
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,400
Every time I take a step forward,

885
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,400
I'm afraid that I'll be your limit.

886
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,400
And your limit is changing day by day.

887
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,400
I'm afraid that I'll be too scared to be your limit.

888
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,400
That kind of feeling of leaving the office.

889
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,400
Do you understand?

890
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,400
Sorry.

891
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,400
Maybe I was too angry by Zhang Aili.

892
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,400
I should have told you those words.

893
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,400
If I were the same,

894
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,400
I would have pushed you away.

895
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,400
Because I didn't have the courage to know the real answer.

896
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,400
So I avoided it.

897
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,400
Because our past

898
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,400
filled a void of a pair of lies.

899
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,400
I'm facing you.

900
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,400
I keep guessing what's real and what's fake.

901
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,400
What's real and what's fake.

902
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,400
Actually,

903
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,400
I'm quite happy that you're making this temper with me.

904
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,400
Tell me your real feelings.

905
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,400
But you must believe me.

906
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:31,400
I'm really nothing to Zhang Aili.

907
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,400
You don't have to explain to me.

908
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,400
I must explain to you.

909
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:39,400
Because you're a real woman.

910
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,400
Just like you misunderstood me and Zhang Aili.

911
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,400
Maybe

912
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,400
I did the same stupid thing.

913
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,400
I'm sorry.

914
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,400
I'm sorry.

915
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,400
I'm sorry.

916
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,400
I'm sorry.

917
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,400
I'm sorry.

918
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,400
I'm sorry.

919
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,400
Maybe I should believe you in front of me.

920
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,400
What I'm doing

921
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,400
and what I'm saying

922
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,400
are all real.

923
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,400
Maybe

924
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,400
we still have a chance.

925
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,400
Maybe I should have more courage to believe you.

926
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,400
Isn't this what a couple should be like?

927
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,400
If we want to be together forever,

928
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,400
we must be honest.

929
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:14,400
Maybe you have something in your heart that you don't dare to tell me.

930
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,400
But as long as you dare to say it,

931
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,400
I will believe you.

932
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,400
I don't want to hide it from you.

933
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,400
No matter it's six years ago

934
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,400
or now.

935
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,400
I'm sorry.

936
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,400
I left six years ago.

937
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,400
Maybe you will not be able to understand me.

938
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,400
I want to tell you

939
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,400
that I will make such a choice.

940
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,400
It's all fate.

941
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,400
I'm going to wash up.

942
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,400
I'm going to wash up.

943
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,400
I won't believe you in front of me.

944
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,400
You did it for my courage.

945
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,400
You should be brave.

946
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,400
I want to know

947
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,400
what you chose six years ago.

948
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,400
I ordered dinner at the beach tonight.

949
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,400
If you want to,

950
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,400
I hope we can meet again six years ago.

951
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,400
I'm sure.

952
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,400
We exist for each other.

953
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,400
We.

954
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,400
I hope that tonight's dinner

955
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:42,400
will not be the same as Zhang Anli and Gou Zai.

956
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,400
OK.

957
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,400
Let's go.

958
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,400
Come here, Gou Anli.

959
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,400
Come here.

960
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,400
Wait a minute.

961
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:29,160
I feel this for you, I want you to take care of this child Fighting I'm in your heart

962
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,200
I'm tied for you

963
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,220
Satire

964
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:44,720
Without you

965
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,780
You should learn kids

966
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:51,660
Sense of taste

967
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:54,660
There's no one

968
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:03,660
You're so cute

969
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:07,660
You're so cute

970
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:14,660
You're so cute

971
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:17,660
You're so cute

972
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:24,660
You're so cute

973
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:29,660
You're so cute

974
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:37,660
Hey, baby

975
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:39,660
We're going to take a ride together

976
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:44,660
I don't know

977
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:49,660
You might ask about Xie's dad and Xie's mom

978
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:53,660
I'm waiting for you

979
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:17,660
I'm waiting

980
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:19,660
It must be

981
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:21,660
Xie's mom is going to hug the baby

982
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:23,660
She's going to hug the baby

983
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:27,660
Is that so?

984
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:30,660
Yes, she's done it

985
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:33,660
Let's hug the baby

986
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:35,660
Like Xiao Le

987
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:41,660
Xiao Le, you know a lot

988
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:43,660
Let's hug together

989
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:46,660
Let's hug

990
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:51,660
I've grown up

991
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:53,660
I don't need to hug the baby

992
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:57,660
But I want to hug the baby

993
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:40,660
The baby is coming back

994
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:46,660
Xiao Le, hurry up

995
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:48,660
No, I want to pick up the baby

996
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:50,660
I can go home after I pick up the baby

997
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,660
The necklace

998
01:05:57,660 --> 01:05:59,660
Look, grandma

999
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:01,660
Can I give it to Mu Chen?

1000
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:03,660
This is my necklace

1001
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:05,660
I've been looking for it for so long

1002
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:07,660
It must be you, right, sister?

1003
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:10,660
No, I picked it up here

1004
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:12,660
You said no

1005
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:15,660
The necklace was in my bag

1006
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:17,660
I saw you drawing there

1007
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:19,660
It must be you, right?

1008
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:21,660
I picked it up here

1009
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:23,660
You're lying to me

1010
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:26,660
I picked it up here

1011
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:28,660
You picked it up here

1012
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:31,660
Miss, is there anything wrong with her grandma?

1013
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:33,660
You stole my necklace

1014
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:37,660
Before we get to the point, please don't talk nonsense

1015
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,660
I've been sitting there

1016
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:41,660
I've never left her since she stole it

1017
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:43,660
How can you say it's her thing?

1018
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:45,660
She said she wanted to take it back to her mother

1019
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:48,660
If I picked it up, why didn't she give it to the police?

1020
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:50,660
She wanted to take it back to her mother

1021
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:52,660
What's the secret?

1022
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:54,660
You want to see a kid like her

1023
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:57,660
She knows how much she values when she picks up this thing

1024
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:59,660
Besides, she's so young

1025
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:01,660
She knows she wants to give it to the police

1026
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:04,660
I think you're going to bully her

1027
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:05,660
I...

1028
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:06,660
I've found it

1029
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:08,660
Or else I'll buy you another one

1030
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:10,660
You're right, you're so fair

1031
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:13,660
This grandma wants to take my necklace with her

1032
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:16,660
Don't say that

1033
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:17,660
What?

1034
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:19,660
You are?

1035
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:21,660
Chairman

1036
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:25,660
She's the chairman of our school

1037
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:27,660
Why did you steal my necklace?

1038
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:29,660
Don't make a scene. I'm sorry

1039
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:32,660
Chairman, I'm sorry

1040
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:35,660
It's not a misunderstanding

1041
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:37,660
She's your girlfriend

1042
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:42,660
She's a student from the county

1043
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:46,660
Wait

1044
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:48,660
Here you are

1045
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:49,660
Thanks

1046
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:52,660
Chairman is so cool

1047
01:07:53,660 --> 01:07:55,660
He's playing with his friends

1048
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:57,660
The police

1049
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:10,660
Come on, let's pick up the phone and go home

1050
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:18,660
You're so funny

1051
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:20,660
You want to take me to the police station?

1052
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:23,660
I've been busy since I was a child

1053
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:27,660
I want to study Chinese, Chinese and English

1054
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:30,660
You're so hardworking

1055
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:34,660
I don't have any school. Don't you like me?

1056
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:36,660
How could I?

1057
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:39,660
I just want you to be happy

1058
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:41,660
I want to be happy with my dad

1059
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:44,660
I want to be happy with my friends

1060
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:46,660
I don't care where I am

1061
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:50,660
I just want to be happy with you

1062
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:58,660
Let's play with Mu Chen tomorrow

1063
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:26,660
I'm sorry

1064
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:28,660
I'm sorry

1065
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:30,660
I'm sorry

1066
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:31,660
I'm sorry

1067
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:33,660
I was wrong

1068
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:36,660
If I was guilty

1069
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:38,660
I'd be fired

1070
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:39,660
Uncle

1071
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:43,660
I killed him

1072
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:48,660
I'm sorry for the crime I've committed

1073
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:51,660
You must help Tuoyang

1074
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:53,660
Only you can help him

1075
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:57,660
Some people choose to lie to others

1076
01:10:57,660 --> 01:10:59,660
Because they love him

1077
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:01,660
You think I can't bear it?

1078
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:03,660
You can't do anything

1079
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:05,660
I don't know what to do

1080
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:07,660
I'm sorry

1081
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:09,660
If I get another chance

1082
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:12,660
I won't let this end

1083
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:17,660
Why did you leave?

1084
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:20,660
No reason

1085
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:22,660
You're too much

1086
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:24,660
I should tell you

1087
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:27,660
Six years ago

1088
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:29,660
Why did I leave you?

1089
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:31,660
I know

1090
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:34,660
There are many things I don't know

1091
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:37,660
But if I start over

1092
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:39,660
I only need one answer

1093
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:50,660
I'm sorry

1094
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:52,660
I'm sorry

1095
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:54,660
I was wrong

1096
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:56,660
I was wrong

1097
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:58,660
I was wrong

1098
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:00,660
I was wrong

1099
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:02,660
I was wrong

1100
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:04,660
I was wrong

1101
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:06,660
I was wrong

1102
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:08,660
I was wrong

1103
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:10,660
I was wrong

1104
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:12,660
I was wrong

1105
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:14,660
I was wrong

1106
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:16,660
I was wrong

1107
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:18,660
I was wrong

1108
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:20,660
Living again

1109
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:23,660
I know

1110
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:25,660
We were not meant to be

1111
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:27,660
Living again

1112
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:29,660
Living again

1113
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:32,660
Living again

1114
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:35,660
You can't do if you have no shoulder

1115
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:39,660
They're all your wings

1116
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:45,660
I always come up

1117
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:47,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1118
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:49,660
I'm not sure.

1119
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:51,660
I'm not sure.

1120
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:53,660
I'm not sure.

1121
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:55,660
I'm not sure.

1122
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:57,660
I'm not sure.

1123
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:59,660
I'm not sure.

1124
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:01,660
I'm not sure.

1125
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:03,660
I'm not sure.

1126
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:05,660
I'm not sure.

1127
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:07,660
I'm not sure.

1128
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:09,660
I'm not sure.

1129
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:11,660
I'm not sure.

1130
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:13,660
I'm not sure.

1131
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:15,660
I'm not sure.
