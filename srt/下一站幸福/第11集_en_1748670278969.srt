1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Next, I will give you a happy next time

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Actually, I always want to be in front of her

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Tell her, thank you for giving me a child

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This child is the best gift in my life

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I am not my father, I know my father is not an alien

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't know my father, why can't he find me?

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I want to be in front of her, Mu Chen, father, that's enough

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Thank you

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Why are you so nice to me?

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You don't have to be so heartless, I will call Xu Fang to take care of you

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
In short, he will take care of you

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Uncle

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You are a good friend, you are a good friend

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You are a good friend

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Hua Tianchun is a good friend

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The person who is the most important is the one who is the most important

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I am the only one who is the most important

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I am so old, I can't repay him

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
He said he would sign the contract

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I signed it, where is the contract?

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I want to sign it

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You can't sign this contract

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Why?

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I am actually a liar

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You are a liar, you are a liar

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You are just like the old man, you said you are a liar

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Hua Tianchun

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Bin

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
He is not a liar

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You are a liar

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You are a liar

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You are lying

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You are a liar

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Brother, why are you saying this?

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Because the lawyer in front of us is the future lawyer of Hua Yuqin

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
How could he help us?

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Mr. Nen, we are talking about this

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Are you really suspecting the company?

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Hua Yuqin is trying to get our money

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But he can't

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
He is looking for the old man

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
He is trying to get the money

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We are not moving you now

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So he sent you to help us move you

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Am I right?

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I don't know what is wrong with him

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Bin is involved

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
No wonder you want to sign the contract

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You are telling us we can't win

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You can't help us in the beginning

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's right

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
But now...

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I don't know if he believes you

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You are lying

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You are lying

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Everyone, listen to me

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That's right

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I am the ex-wife of Hua Yuqin

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I have signed the contract

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I want to ask you to sign the contract and leave

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But then...

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
A lot of things happened here

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I met everyone

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And I found you all trusted me

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I can't do it by myself

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Plus, I found the contract was too short

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I think this is a problem

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So I want to help you find out

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I am telling you to let go

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
If we didn't know your identity

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We wouldn't know you sold Hua Tianchun to us

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Hua Tianchun did this to us

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What's the difference between you and you?

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
We will definitely report it

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
We will find a new lawyer to help us

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You can leave

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Hua Tianchun doesn't need you

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You said it yourself

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Do you have any proof?

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
A poisonous ghost said he was cheated

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Do you think the police will believe you?

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You can't take it as proof

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You can't win

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Without me, Hua Tianchun will lose

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Don't worry

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
He is here

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Don't come over

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I want to get angry

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I want to get angry

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I want to get angry

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We need to get angry

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I want to get angry

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I want to get angry

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I want to get angry

95
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I want to get angry

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Stop it

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Calm down

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Don't talk

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
We are not men

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Men are not men

101
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
They are just friends

102
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
If we are friends, we will be friends

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Friends are not friends

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I know

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I know everything

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But he has been helping us a lot

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He won't hurt us now

108
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You want to help him?

109
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
He is a good guy

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I said

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
He is not so kind

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He is Xiaole's father

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I think you should have been secretly in the hospital

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We are so kind to you

115
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Don't be so shameless

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I don't

117
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Put it away

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I will break your mouth

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You want to get angry

120
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You are scaring us

121
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We don't know how to get angry

122
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We are not afraid of you

123
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Get out

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Don't come over

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Don't come over

126
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Don't come over

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Don't come over

128
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Don't come over

129
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Don't you want to see

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
When we were not the flower garden

131
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
We were so kind to you

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Where are you going?

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You are not a good guy

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You just want to help him

135
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Go

136
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Get out

137
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Don't come over

138
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Get out

139
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I am the one who did the wrong

140
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Don't be so shameless

141
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I know what I am saying

142
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You don't care

143
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's my fault

144
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Sorry

145
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I will leave the flower garden

146
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
That's okay

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I have a feeling that I am still floating

148
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I love to be crazy

149
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I am crazy

150
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
My dream is very strong

151
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But I will never forget

152
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I have never thought

153
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That the world is my world

154
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
How bad is the world

155
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I can't wake up

156
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I love to fall

157
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I fall into despair

158
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I am hurt but I will never forget

159
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We are not the same

160
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The first heaven

161
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The final lie

162
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The first love

163
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Mu Chen

164
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Don't be silly

165
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
He is not the person you know

166
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I called my former colleague

167
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Six years ago

168
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
After he opened the knife

169
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
He immediately became the daughter of the chairman

170
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
He is now a powerful person

171
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
He is like his mother

172
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And his future father

173
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Do you know how his father-in-law

174
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
How did he come?

175
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
As long as you have money

176
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Whether you are the market of the house

177
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Or you are the person of the girl

178
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
He can help them

179
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
To help them

180
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But he also helped the villagers a lot

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
He saved the life of his family

182
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
He helped the flower garden to write a novel

183
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And solve the dispute with the next door

184
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And the day of the family's wedding

185
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
He helped the father-in-law

186
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
To fulfill his dream

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Father-in-law

188
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Can he pretend to be a father-in-law for the rest of his life?

189
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Is this what you want?

190
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Of course not

191
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It is not good to enlarge the debt

192
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Give me a cover

193
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The door sırada is tied

194
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I will go there

195
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The chimney is so high

196
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The air is really nice

197
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Goodness

198
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Eunuch

199
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
How could you see the pirates in the army?

200
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You will need to watch out

201
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I believe you are the same as me

202
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Even if this person in front of you

203
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
was all memories of last time

204
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But he was still the one

205
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
who was sincere

206
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
and willing to help people

207
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
He can definitely make the most right judgment

208
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I will hurt him

209
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's because you love him

210
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
No

211
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I just think

212
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I shouldn't have done this to him

213
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Are you cheating on him?

214
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Or on yourself?

215
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Or on me?

216
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I will not let you go

217
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm coming

218
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm going to report you

219
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Does it hurt?

220
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
No, not at all

221
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I don't want to

222
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I admit

223
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I was just in a bad mood

224
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I really want to help

225
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Why can't they calm down and listen to me?

226
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
If it's not the official thing

227
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I won't be able to get the official present

228
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I won't be able to get the official flower field village

229
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What official?

230
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's my reason

231
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I've received a case

232
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's a big boss

233
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
who bullied his family's help girl

234
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I was originally ready to accept this official

235
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
But I don't know why

236
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I was too much to say this to this girl

237
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I just hit her with my hand

238
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I've never failed this thing

239
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I don't care if I was the one who was guilty

240
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Just because of this strange power

241
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I came from the official flower field village

242
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
This is why

243
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
you called Xiao Le to face his mistakes in the city

244
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
and told him about his husband's story

245
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Because you were doing the same thing

246
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Actually you know

247
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
that person is wrong

248
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But you have to help him change

249
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So you have a problem on your head

250
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
That power is not good

251
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's not good

252
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm sorry

253
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm sorry

254
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I've made a mistake

255
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That power is not strange

256
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
But you know you're wrong

257
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I've always believed

258
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
that the inner depth of the person

259
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
is the most sincere side of me

260
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But I can't pretend or lie to others

261
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Is that so?

262
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Xiao Le's father

263
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You just said that you know someone like you

264
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
He looks

265
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
very annoying

266
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
very bad

267
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
He often does

268
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
things that make people feel uncomfortable

269
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
But the most important point is

270
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
his actions

271
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
are not completely true

272
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Stop right now

273
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Thank you for believing me

274
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
and taking care of me

275
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm sorry for keeping you guys

276
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
in my care

277
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Don't say that

278
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You've helped me a lot

279
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And Xiao Le

280
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You may never know

281
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
that your appearance

282
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
is very meaningful

283
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
for us

284
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's like

285
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
this is the arrangement of the shop

286
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I don't understand

287
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
why I live here

288
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You think you can leave

289
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
and make me a big mess

290
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I can't do

291
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
what I should do

292
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I should have left

293
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
and not regret

294
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
But now

295
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I feel regret

296
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Why?

297
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I don't want to go back to your company

298
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
and beat you

299
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm going to the market

300
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You're too high

301
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm not going to let you

302
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
beat me up

303
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What are you doing?

304
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
He's a thief

305
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
He's a thief

306
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
He's a thief

307
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
He's a thief

308
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You're a thief

309
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You're a thief

310
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
He's my wife

311
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You're a man

312
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You're not qualified to have him

313
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
No, you're not

314
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
He's a thief

315
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You're a thief

316
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
He's not going to the hospital

317
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
He's going to take away his thief

318
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Give it to him

319
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
He's a thief

320
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You're not like that

321
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
He's a thief

322
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
He's a thief

323
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Give it to him

324
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Sorry

325
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I have to go

326
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I hope you can help me

327
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
A thief

328
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
is too much

329
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Look

330
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Look

331
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
He's a thief

332
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
He's a thief

333
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You're so poor

334
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You're a thief

335
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You're so rich

336
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You're a thief

337
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You're a thief

338
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You're a thief

339
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You're a thief

340
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You're just like a thief

341
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
How can you be so rich?

342
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Right

343
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Look at his head

344
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Look at his mouth

345
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
No

346
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
He's a thief

347
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What are you doing?

348
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You're so rich

349
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You're so poor

350
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
This thief

351
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
is the thief

352
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
who has his own water

353
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And I don't have a fat body

354
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You're different from water

355
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Don't be like this

356
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You're not a thief

357
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You're a thief

358
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Yes

359
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You're a thief

360
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You're a thief

361
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You're so rich

362
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You're a thief

363
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You're a thief

364
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You're a thief

365
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You're a thief

366
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I don't have a fat body

367
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Boss

368
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
The Bollywood manufacturing company

369
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
is around the corner of Huatian Village

370
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Every year,

371
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
a lot of heavy machinery is produced

372
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
in the Bollywood manufacturing company

373
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Ou Chen

374
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
When you were in Huatian Village

375
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
you were allergic to it

376
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Maybe the water in Huatian Village

377
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
was really polluted

378
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Look

379
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
This is the photo I got this morning

380
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
The Bollywood manufacturing company

381
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
is probably the source of polluted water

382
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
If the soil and water are polluted

383
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
the black-cutting will not be polluted

384
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
No way

385
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm a big fan of the plant

386
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm not a big fan of the plant

387
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Yes

388
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
The Bollywood manufacturing company

389
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
is finally in the middle of polluting

390
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Is it the Bollywood manufacturing company

391
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
that knows that there are polluted water problems

392
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
in the Bollywood manufacturing company?

393
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So, we should buy Huatian Village

394
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
to prove this fact

395
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
No wonder they can't

396
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
get the polluted water from us

397
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
If it's the polluted water

398
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
that makes us know

399
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
they'll be in trouble

400
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
But this is a retreat

401
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
We still need to find evidence

402
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
and return to Caibei

403
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Please give me another chance

404
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm willing to stay

405
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
and help you get the justice

406
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
The Bollywood manufacturing company

407
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
has already applied for the money

408
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
We'll have to change it tomorrow

409
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
We don't have much time

410
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Go back to Caibei

411
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You...

412
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You go to Mr. Zhao's office

413
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I'll go to the office

414
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
before this morning

415
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'll go to Le Zihong's office

416
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I believe

417
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
he's also been in a fight

418
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
But in the end

419
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
he still wants to help us

420
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
and doesn't hurt us

421
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So, give him another chance

422
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
and trust Guangxi

423
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Enough. I'm sorry

424
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Mr. Ren

425
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'll return the money to you

426
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
in Huatian Village

427
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Huatian Village

428
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Huatian Village

429
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'll keep an eye on you

430
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Don't mess with me

431
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Huatian Village

432
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
People say that

433
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
the heart is broken

434
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I didn't expect that Mr. Ren

435
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
was so bad

436
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's okay

437
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
The old man

438
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
was so bad

439
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
If he didn't

440
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'd be sold to him

441
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
half of our money

442
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
and he wouldn't have taken the money

443
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Who are you?

444
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Mr. Ren

445
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Are you from the same town?

446
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Are you from Caibei?

447
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yes

448
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
No

449
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You're the one who...

450
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You're the one who...

451
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You must be from the underground

452
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
We're from the same town

453
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
We're from the same town

454
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
We're from the underground

455
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
We're the same town

456
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
We're the same town

457
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
We're the same town

458
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
We're from the underground

459
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
We're the same town

460
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Mr. Ren

461
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
we suspect that

462
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
the entire Huatian Village

463
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
has been polluted by the Bollywood factory

464
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
That's because

465
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
the waste from the waste

466
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
will be polluted by the waste

467
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
He decided to stay

468
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
and help us find the right area

469
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm thinking

470
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
the amount of water in the Bollywood factory

471
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
has already affected the environment

472
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
in Huatian Village

473
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
If we can prove this

474
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
we'll know

475
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
why we're not allowed

476
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
to buy the land

477
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
If we're exposed to the light

478
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
the waste will be polluted by the waste

479
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
What?

480
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You're not saying anything

481
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
He's right

482
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
We're from the soil

483
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
that's been polluted by the waste

484
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
and the waste

485
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
He's also going to

486
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
the hospital to check it

487
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
When I'm done with the waste

488
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'll check the results

489
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
of the polluted waste

490
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
and the waste from the factory

491
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
and compare them

492
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
We'll know the result

493
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Yes

494
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Mr. Ren

495
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I believe in Mr. Tui's words

496
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I think

497
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
we shouldn't drink

498
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
the water from the natural

499
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Tui

500
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
find the water from the Bollywood factory

501
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
and get the natural water

502
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
and take the waste to this place

503
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I have to go to the hospital

504
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'll take you back

505
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
to the hospital

506
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Master

507
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
be careful with the food you're eating

508
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I heard that

509
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
the workers in the Bollywood factory are fierce

510
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Don't worry

511
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'll help you tomorrow morning

512
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
The food is waiting for me

513
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I should go

514
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Taipei is coming to return the food

515
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I don't think I can

516
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
eat with you

517
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You should be careful

518
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
The Bollywood factory

519
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Hello, Taipei

520
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
This is my fiancée He Yiqian

521
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Don't worry

522
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
She's more kind than I am

523
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
If there's a real angel in the world

524
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
it's her

525
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Mr. Ren

526
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
you're really blind

527
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Taipei

528
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
you shouldn't have said that

529
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm just a normal woman

530
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm not a Cai Huibei

531
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm a Caibei

532
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Caibei

533
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I'll help you clean up

534
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You go and clean up

535
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'll get the stuff for you

536
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
OK, thank you

537
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I'm sorry

538
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I'm sure that the doctor is right

539
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
But why did he come to see a doctor so late?

540
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
He has to remove the disease

541
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Only then can he cure it

542
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Guangxi

543
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Is this really related to the Bollywood factory?

544
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Ba Chen

545
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
The day I came to Caibei

546
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I've already said it

547
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
When other villagers started to

548
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
spread rumors and evils

549
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
We have to wait for the results

550
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
to get the truth

551
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Will we...

552
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
No

553
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
How do you know what I'm talking about?

554
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
You want to ask me

555
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
why we got the father's objection

556
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
because of this, right?

557
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Guangxi

558
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
As long as it's the right thing

559
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I'll support you

560
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
But dad made a mistake

561
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And he can't stop me from being with you

562
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
OK, I'll take you to the hospital

563
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
OK, where are you taking me?

564
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Hua Tengchun

565
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Hey

566
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Tell me

567
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
If dad's factory

568
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
really caused the environment to be damaged

569
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Besides compensation

570
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
will the Empress Dowager take responsibility?

571
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Don't worry

572
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I'll save Bo Fu

573
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Don't let him get pregnant

574
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I'll do my best to let both of them

575
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
hurt him as much as possible

576
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
OK

577
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I heard you said you'd get this thing back

578
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
It's been a few days

579
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Why are you so big?

580
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Maybe these rumors have changed my dad

581
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Did I mention to you last time?

582
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
My wife and child

583
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
The child has a low-protein diabetes

584
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I'm a parent of a kindergarten

585
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Pretending to be a child's father

586
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I want to surprise him

587
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
That little boy

588
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
He told me

589
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
To be honest

590
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
A 5-year-old child

591
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
taught me to be honest

592
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
So

593
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I decided to find the real answer

594
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
No matter what the result is

595
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I just know that these rumors

596
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
shouldn't be lost to their families

597
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
You're taking dad as your father

598
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
No wonder you refused to come back

599
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
to let me get married by myself

600
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I just want to get married to you

601
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I'm so annoyed

602
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I don't think I'll be a real man

603
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
How could that single mother

604
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
have a boyfriend already?

605
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Don't be so hard on me

606
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I'm just kidding

607
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Why are you so nervous?

608
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
By the way

609
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
You said that kid is a little happy, right?

610
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
You're back

611
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Remember to take your medicine at the hospital

612
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
It will cure your feet faster

613
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
You can come back next week

614
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Doctor He, you're so kind

615
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I'll listen to you

616
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Take your medicine at the hospital

617
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
We all love the mountain, the water and the light

618
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
We're all very enthusiastic

619
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
We're free to go there

620
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I believe the little meat's mother

621
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
will be very happy to see you

622
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I promise you

623
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I'll go there

624
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
By the way, Guangxi

625
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
This is for the fruit cake

626
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
that Tang Yao Bi and Xiaotang have

627
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
There's no sugar in it except for the fruit

628
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I'm a little man

629
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Thank you

630
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I'll be back

631
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
No matter what you want

632
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I'll be willing to get married

633
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Dongfang, Xifang, and A'Laibo

634
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
No problem

635
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I'll just have the food

636
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I'll give you the ice cream tomorrow

637
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
What's wrong?

638
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Nothing

639
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
You're going to cut your hair

640
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Brother He, you're back at the clinic

641
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I'm really injured

642
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Come out quickly

643
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I'll go take a shower

644
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I think it's bad

645
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I'm really bad

646
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
No, I don't need it

647
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I'll give you the medicine

648
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Take it to Lele

649
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Then you can take it for free

650
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I'll take it

651
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I'm telling you

652
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Ever since I heard that you and Brother Huang fought

653
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Do you know that I'm worried about you?

654
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Don't move

655
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,360
You've been a heavy-duty

656
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,000
since you were born

657
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
You've been carrying the fruit cake

658
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I've been helping you with the medicine

659
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I'm afraid you'll get hurt

660
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
No, you can't do this again

661
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
You know that?

662
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Come on, I'll help you

663
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Thank you

664
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I'll go first

665
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
You don't want to drink?

666
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I'll use the oil to help you

667
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I'll go get the hot pot

668
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Be careful

669
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I'll drink it

670
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
It's good

671
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
It's good

672
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I heard that you and Brother Huang

673
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
When you were going to save the Ice Age

674
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I helped you to beg for it

675
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
You've been a heavy-duty

676
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Since you were born

677
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
You've been a heavy-duty

678
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You've been a heavy-duty

679
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I've been a heavy-duty

680
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I'm here to take care of you

681
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
What about you?

682
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Are you willing to do this?

683
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I think it's good

684
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
It's nothing bad

685
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I've never thought about my life

686
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I have other possibilities

687
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I don't want to think about it

688
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Otherwise, I'd be angry

689
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
You know that I like to jump

690
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I'm afraid that if I'm caught

691
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
My life will be different

692
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I think you should go

693
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Didn't you hear that the Ice Age has started?

694
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Brother Tui

695
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
You really like to joke

696
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
But I like your humor

697
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Tui Xin, listen to me

698
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Brother Tui

699
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Do you remember

700
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
When we were in the high school

701
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I was the captain of the Lala team

702
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Brother Huang was the captain of the Blue Ball Team

703
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I was the captain of the Blue Ball Team

704
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I was the captain of the Blue Ball Team

705
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
When everyone was on the field

706
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Everyone would hit me

707
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Tui Xin, listen to me

708
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Do you want to listen to me?

709
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I remember the old saying

710
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I can shout to you

711
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Tui Xin, don't do this

712
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I don't want to listen to you

713
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Enough

714
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I can't hear you

715
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I'm going to help you

716
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I'll help you to be a sister

717
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Brother Tui

718
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
If he calls you again

719
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Please give me a big thank you

720
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Thank you for sending me so many cookies

721
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Just tell him yourself

722
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
The most exciting game on the line

723
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
The game of mahjong

724
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
The game of mahjong

725
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
The game of mahjong

726
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
The game of mahjong

727
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
The game of mahjong

728
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
The game of mahjong

729
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
The game of mahjong

730
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
The game of mahjong

731
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
The game of mahjong

732
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
You just protege yourself

733
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Get rich with good looks

734
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,320
You just repairs the visual

735
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,000
You are even more excited

736
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
which made people laugh

737
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I got it

738
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Brother Hei

739
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,860
My ruler

740
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,000
Let it all be

741
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
That's all

742
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I'm sorry

743
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,600
Brother Tui

744
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,600
Did Wei Wenqi forget you?

745
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
She's standing by my side.

746
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,100
She knows her father's factory is in danger.

747
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,100
She's very sad for everyone.

748
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,500
You two are so good friends.

749
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,300
You're such a good person.

750
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,300
She's beautiful and kind.

751
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,000
How do you know she's beautiful?

752
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Have you seen her before?

753
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:34,100
Xiao Ye knows that your eyes must be very high.

754
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,600
That's right.

755
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:47,100
If you really want to thank her,

756
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,900
then I'll return the red radish to the fridge.

757
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,600
Yes!

758
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,100
Let me open it.

759
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,100
I'm not very good at it either.

760
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,100
I'm coming!

761
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,500
Newbie, I've already sent the money to the hospital.

762
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,100
I'll know the result tomorrow noon.

763
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,900
What are we going to do next?

764
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,500
You came just in time. I have some information we can study.

765
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,100
8 p.m.

766
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,460
Wei Wenqi

767
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,820
I want to come!

768
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,680
Wenqi,

769
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:49,500
After the third year, the exchange data of glass factory has been found.

770
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,500
But in the end, the report is still passed.

771
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,500
There must be a rule in the middle.

772
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:00,500
And this data came from here.

773
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:13,500
This Zhang Zhen Ji is the power of the environmental protection system.

774
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,500
Is it possible for him to help the environmental industry to make fake reviews?

775
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,500
It's possible.

776
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,500
The business deal with the government is a common thing.

777
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:26,500
If we can prove Zhang Zhen Ji has helped the environmental industry to make fake reports,

778
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,500
we can prove that the environmental industry has always known about this.

779
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,500
All of this is a conspiracy.

780
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,500
Including using the gambling to get the land.

781
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,500
It's all for the sake of the cover-up.

782
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,500
He will avoid the legal responsibility.

783
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,500
Zhang Zhen Ji has been conducting the review of the environmental protection system.

784
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,500
Maybe tomorrow, there will be a meeting.

785
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,500
I will have to make sure the details of the time and location.

786
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:19,500
Fl紙自然相過 卻不會忘 無核盜

787
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,500
Come, let me help you

788
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,500
Wow, what a great place

789
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,500
Xiao Le, let's eat

790
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:58,500
Xiao Le, you usually sit in my room

791
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,500
Xiao Le, you said we were going to pay, so you don't know

792
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,500
Don't be so noisy, it's almost done, let's eat

793
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,500
Coming

794
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,500
Here, take one for yourself

795
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,500
Thank you

796
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,500
Xiao Le, this soup is so hot, it smells so good

797
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,500
Have a bowl

798
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,500
Xiao Le, I like the pineapple chicken the most

799
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,500
Xiao Le, here, give it to you

800
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,500
Wow, it's a pineapple chicken with a short tail

801
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,500
I made it for you

802
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,500
Yes, I like it

803
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,500
It's like a rose, give it to me, my mom will give it to you

804
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,500
What's the problem, give me all the pineapple

805
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,500
I like the pineapple the most

806
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,500
Here

807
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:51,500
No, you're so hard, you saved the ice cream from the ice cream shop

808
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:55,500
I can't help you, I can only make you a good soup

809
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,500
I'll go get some soup

810
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,500
Xiao Le, eat more, here

811
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,500
Xiao Le, I'll tell you

812
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:12,500
We can't eat the food, who taught you to be so bad

813
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,500
What if Xiao Le finds out

814
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,500
But you don't like pineapple

815
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:26,500
pineapple is a speciality, we made it for you, you can make it as high and strong as me

816
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,500
Really?

817
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,500
You always force me to be pineapple

818
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,500
Mr. Ren Guangxi, what's that noise?

819
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,500
You must eat pineapple

820
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:44,500
Besides Xiao Le's good eyes, he has a rich taste and is good at preventing you from being addicted

821
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,500
He can increase your immunity, prevent you from being old

822
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,500
He's got a soft and soft taste, he's got a good chance

823
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,500
Don't listen to him, eat more

824
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,500
You must eat bitter melon

825
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,500
Besides the fire, he's got a rich taste

826
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,500
Everyone calls him the king of melon

827
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:11,500
The most important thing is bitter melon is very useful for the adjustment of the amount of food

828
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,500
It's very suitable for Xiao Le's children

829
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,500
Can I not eat it?

830
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,500
No

831
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:29,500
Here, have some soup

832
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:37,500
And I want to make a empty plate, put the fish in the back and give it to the dog

833
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,500
Who can eat it?

834
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,500
Yes

835
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,500
How about me?

836
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,500
How about me?

837
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,500
Everyone, quiet, listen to what he said

838
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:15,500
Since I came here last time, it's been a week

839
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:21,500
Tonight, I'm here to remind you that tomorrow is the last day

840
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:25,500
I warn you not to waste time and make up for it

841
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,500
You'd better start to leave now

842
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,500
You're forcing me to report

843
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,500
Don't be afraid, everyone, let's sit down and see what he's got

844
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,500
Let's go

845
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,500
Let's go

846
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,500
Let's go

847
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,500
Let's go

848
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,500
Let's go

849
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,500
Let's go

850
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,500
Let's go

851
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,500
Let's go

852
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,500
Let's go

853
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:53,500
Help me persuade these shameless villagers to cooperate with me, okay?

854
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,500
Or they'll be the ones who'll eat the bitter melon

855
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,500
I was a little uncertain

856
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:08,500
But seeing you jump over the wall, I have to believe my doubts are true

857
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,500
I knew that my glass factory was polluting

858
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:15,500
I didn't tell the villagers that I wanted to buy the land to pollute the city

859
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,500
I tried to avoid the punishment and compensation

860
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,500
That's why I was so eager to buy the garden

861
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,500
You're a blind man, your mind is confused, right?

862
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,500
We're in such a big period, if there's a problem

863
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,500
How can the factory continue to pollute?

864
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,500
You didn't have the evidence to pollute the city

865
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,500
You're so ridiculous

866
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,500
Do you have the evidence to know it tomorrow?

867
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,500
I'll represent Huatian Village

868
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,500
I'll be the one to get the compensation

869
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,500
No matter what evidence you have, you can't get it

870
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,500
Just tell me the truth

871
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,500
It's 12 o'clock tomorrow

872
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,500
I'll teach you these illegal immigrants

873
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,500
to get the land to pollute

874
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,500
You're so stubborn

875
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,500
I'm not a lawyer, I'm a lawyer

876
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,500
You're a little bit more mature

877
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,500
Let go of me

878
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,500
Let go of me, I'm begging you

879
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,500
Let go of me

880
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,500
Liangmu City and Ren Guangxi have been in the city for a long time

881
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,500
And Ren Guangxi is also doing this for his own sake

882
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,500
To make Liangmu City a better place

883
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:36,500
This is the biggest scandal ever since the start of the school

884
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,500
Ren Guangxi, it's like this

885
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,500
No wonder you can do nothing but be a team

886
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,500
It turns out that you forgot to give up on your old love

887
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,500
I really felt sad for the past

888
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,500
Even if you forget all the memories,

889
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,500
some things will still not change

890
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,500
What do you mean?

891
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,500
I don't mean anything

892
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,500
I just feel sorry for you

893
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,500
Your past, your everything

894
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,500
It's all from others

895
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:27,500
If one day you find out about everything that everyone knows,

896
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:33,500
you'll only know that you hate or not

897
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,500
You'll be unhappy

898
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,500
What are you doing?

899
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,500
Don't come back

900
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,500
What should we do now?

901
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,500
What do you mean?

902
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:04,500
You're talking about the people who are rich and poor

903
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,500
They're really rich

904
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,500
Because this is a good opportunity for us to have a good life

905
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,500
If we really have money,

906
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,500
we'll be able to make a living

907
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,500
and earn money to live with them

908
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,500
Right?

909
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,500
We'll make a living

910
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:23,500
We'll report the pollution test tomorrow noon

911
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,500
We don't have any evidence

912
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,500
Just report it to the police

913
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,500
What's wrong with you?

914
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,500
You're so stupid

915
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,500
You're just a little girl

916
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,500
You're just a little girl

917
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,500
You're just a little girl

918
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:43,500
Don't worry

919
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,500
I promised you

920
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,500
I'll solve it for you

921
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,500
I'm sorry

922
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,500
I'm sorry

923
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,500
There's only one way

924
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,500
Find Zhang Zhenji and prove that he's responsible for the pollution test

925
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,500
He'll have a meeting tomorrow morning

926
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,500
This is our last chance

927
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,500
Let's split up

928
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,500
Mu Chen

929
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,500
Help Ren Guangxi collect the evidence

930
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:21,500
Xu Fang will bring someone to force the suspect tomorrow

931
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,500
I'll stay and make a meeting

932
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,500
I'll delay a little

933
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,500
Let me check

934
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,500
There's a woman named Liang Mu Chen in the garden

935
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,500
Right

936
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,500
Here's your coffee

937
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,500
Thank you

938
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,500
How do you prove that these pollution tests are fake?

939
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,500
It's him

940
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,500
You forgot your money

941
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:06,500
I came to Hua Tianchuan because of that guy

942
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,500
That woman is really pitiful

943
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,500
I just helped her to file a case against the suspect

944
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,500
I'll have to leave for work

945
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,500
He's the safest person to choose from

946
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,500
Can I help you?

947
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,500
You can just do what you're doing now

948
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,500
Be my secretary

949
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,500
But you have to dress up more beautifully

950
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,500
I'll be in the way

951
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,500
Where are we going?

952
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,500
Sheng University

953
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:15,180
The

954
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,500
Liang Mu Chen, I have to admit

955
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,500
You're a single mother

956
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,500
You're a good mother

957
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,500
Can we do this?

958
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,500
I'm afraid I'll mess up your plan

959
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,500
Don't be afraid

960
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,500
What's wrong?

961
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,500
Nothing

962
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,500
I just find it strange

963
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,500
Why did the meeting take place?

964
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,500
I don't know

965
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,500
I just want to say that

966
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,500
I'm sorry

967
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,500
I'm sorry

968
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,500
I'm sorry

969
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,500
I'm sorry

970
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,500
I'm sorry

971
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,500
I'm sorry

972
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,500
I'm sorry

973
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,500
I'm sorry

974
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,500
Why did the meeting take place in this school?

975
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,500
Is it strange?

976
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,500
My mom treats Sheng University as a factory

977
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:44,500
She'll have a lot of activities here every year

978
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,500
Let's go

979
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,500
The

980
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,500
I've been here for years

981
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,500
But I'm not here at all

982
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,500
Don't worry

983
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,500
I haven't been here in the past few years

984
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,500
No one knows me

985
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:42,500
Let's go

986
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,500
The meeting will take place in the school's hall

987
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,500
Hall

988
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,500
You want to be familiar with this place?

989
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:02,500
Yes, because I used to come here to find compromise

990
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,500
It seems that you and compromise are really close

991
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,500
I'm curious

992
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:11,500
Why did you choose compromise and choose Xiao La's dad?

993
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,500
Mr. Chen, we're talking about business

994
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,500
Can't answer your personal questions

995
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,500
Let's go

996
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,500
Zan Zheng Ji, 1st place, Zai Zai Er Shan's cover business

997
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,500
He must be careful in doing things

998
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,500
So in order to let him show off his fox tail

999
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,500
We've already put a lot of salt and eggs

1000
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,500
Now we just have to wait for him to fall into the trap

1001
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,500
Sorry

1002
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,500
Sorry

1003
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,500
Sorry

1004
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,500
Sorry

1005
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,500
I was just here to have a meeting

1006
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,500
I didn't see you

1007
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,500
I can't hit you

1008
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,500
I'm really sorry

1009
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,500
It's okay

1010
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,500
I'm here to have a meeting

1011
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,500
Thank you

1012
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,500
Thank you

1013
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:20,500
Sorry

1014
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,500
The whole town represents the factory is...

1015
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,500
I'm the chairman of the video company, Li Wang Zai

1016
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,500
This is my secret letter

1017
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,500
I'm only applying for a job

1018
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,500
You should go

1019
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,500
Wait a minute, let me check it for you

1020
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,500
Mr. Li, the meeting is starting

1021
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,500
It's a long way

1022
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,500
Chief, it's almost time

1023
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,500
Do you want to go back and prepare?

1024
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,500
How long do we have?

1025
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,500
10 minutes

1026
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:11,500
I didn't expect that we have so many young talents

1027
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:12,500
To win the prize

1028
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,500
Everyone is so concerned about the return of the treasure

1029
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,500
It's really a good chance

1030
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,500
Welcome

1031
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,500
Chief

1032
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,500
Can we have a meeting this time?

1033
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:28,500
This is Li Wang Zai, the vice president of the world-class food industry

1034
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,500
So you're Li Dong

1035
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,500
Welcome

1036
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:40,500
I should have known that you're a good man

1037
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,500
Chief, you're happy

1038
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,500
This is my secret letter

1039
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,500
Please bring the food to the chairman

1040
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,500
We need to talk

1041
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,500
Okay

1042
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,500
Li Dong

1043
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,500
You seem to have a good time today

1044
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:03,500
Chief Zhang, as the head of the treasurery industry

1045
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:07,500
If you don't mind, I have something to ask you

1046
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,500
Please say it

1047
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:12,500
I heard that you are very good at handling the treasure

1048
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,500
For example, you have a lot of parts of the Welcome

1049
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:23,500
And you can accept the result

1050
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,500
Why are you so clear?

1051
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:31,500
It's the contract of the Welcome

1052
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,500
It's introduced to you by me

1053
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:38,500
The Welcome Company has a member of the Xu Fang Group

1054
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,500
You should know him

1055
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:44,500
I know that the Welcome Company is in the glass factory in Huatian Village

1056
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,500
He contacted you

1057
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:50,500
I know a lot of details about this case

1058
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,500
Chief Xu has given me a lot of secret information

1059
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:58,500
If you're willing, I want to discuss with you

1060
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:05,500
So, you and Chief Xu are still old friends

1061
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:11,500
But there is indeed a little chance for Huatian Village to handle this case

1062
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:15,500
But I think if you're willing to help

1063
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,500
You can solve the problem with a few more hands

1064
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:26,500
Miss, I'm sorry, have I ever seen you?

1065
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,500
You've mistaken me

1066
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,500
Miss, I really have no objection

1067
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,500
I'm a college student

1068
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,500
I came here to help the meeting

1069
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,500
I used to be a college student here

1070
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,500
I've really seen you

1071
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,500
No, you really have mistaken me

1072
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,500
Excuse me

1073
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,500
I've never seen you

1074
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,500
This lady is my secretary

1075
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,500
You're also my girlfriend

1076
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,500
What's the problem?

1077
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,500
Thank you for your answer

1078
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,500
But you can leave now

1079
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,500
Of course, you have to continue to act

1080
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,500
I'll be back

1081
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,500
Sorry, I didn't have the chance to explain to you

1082
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,500
This is my secretary, but also my girlfriend

1083
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,500
You should have guessed it earlier

1084
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,500
You're so beautiful

1085
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,500
She's very kind and kind

1086
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,500
But she's a little cold to strangers

1087
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,500
She's a little weird

1088
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,500
I'm glad to meet you

1089
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,500
Thank you

1090
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:37,500
I don't know what your girlfriend is called

1091
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,500
My name is Liang Xiaole

1092
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,500
My name is Liang Xiaole

1093
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,500
I'm glad to see you

1094
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,500
Back to the topic

1095
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:52,500
I just want to open a factory in Nanbu

1096
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,500
But the location is next to a reservoir

1097
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,500
So I have some trouble

1098
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:00,500
I don't know if you can make the return screen

1099
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,500
Pass smoothly

1100
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,500
If you're willing to help me

1101
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,500
I'm sure you can contact me

1102
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:10,500
Of course, I can help you to pay for the return

1103
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:13,500
No matter how much you pay, I'm willing to pay

1104
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:19,500
But first, you can guarantee

1105
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,500
Everything goes smoothly

1106
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,500
What's the problem?

1107
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:30,500
I'm sure you know how to solve Huatian Village's case

1108
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:36,500
I promise you everything will go smoothly

1109
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:44,500
Of course, you need to use a special method when necessary

1110
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,500
You mean...

1111
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:51,500
We'll discuss it in detail later

1112
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,500
You'll know when you do that

1113
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,500
I'll do whatever I say

1114
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:02,500
Huatian Village's case is a very good case

1115
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,500
As long as I'm the head of the company

1116
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:11,500
I'll be fine with the construction

1117
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,500
I'm relieved that you said that

1118
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,500
We'll finish the meeting

1119
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,500
I'll come with you

1120
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,500
Where's the video?

1121
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,500
Really?

1122
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,500
Why are you here?

1123
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,500
Brother Ren, I told you many times

1124
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,500
I'm smaller than you

1125
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,500
You don't have to call me like that

1126
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,500
Right?

1127
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:40,500
Brother Ren, we're like brothers

1128
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,500
I've been doing you a big favor

1129
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,500
Like brothers?

1130
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,500
Why are you here?

1131
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,500
Aren't you busy with the official meeting?

1132
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,500
Why are you here?

1133
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,500
I'm busy with the official meeting

1134
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:58,500
If you don't mind, I need to talk to my brother

1135
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,500
Uncle Liang, please take care of me

1136
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,500
Let's go

1137
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,500
The official meeting?

1138
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,500
Yes

1139
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:18,500
The official meeting we just talked about is that we're going to trouble you

1140
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:21,500
The local residents are going to tell us

1141
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,500
So it's very urgent for you to help

1142
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,500
So it's like this

1143
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,500
The official meeting

1144
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:00,500
Mr. Li, you can take a bath outside today

1145
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:01,500
Because of me

1146
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,500
Mr. Ren

1147
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,500
I came here today because of other cases

1148
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,500
But I'm warning you

1149
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:12,500
If you don't want to be caught,

1150
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,500
you can do as I say

1151
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,500
What's going on?

1152
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,500
How's the situation?

1153
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,500
The criminal has come

1154
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:32,500
If you get into the war machine, I'll be right back

1155
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,500
I have a plan

1156
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:35,500
You should come back soon

1157
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,500
I'm afraid we can't catch up too soon

1158
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,500
You're going to kill me

1159
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,500
You're going to kill me

1160
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,500
You're going to kill me

1161
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:52,500
You're going to kill me

1162
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,500
Get out of the way

1163
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,500
I'm going to kill you

1164
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:04,500
Go on

1165
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:06,500
I'm going to lose

1166
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,500
Get out

1167
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:08,500
What are you doing?

1168
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,500
I'm going to release them

1169
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,500
I'll take you away

1170
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,500
But let's do one last thing

1171
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,500
We'll leave after we finish

1172
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,500
Mr. Ren, you're really weird

1173
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,500
You're going to leave all these things

1174
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,500
Is this plastic plastic?

1175
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,500
Or is it plastic?

1176
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,500
This is plastic

1177
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:34,500
This is plastic

1178
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,500
This is plastic

1179
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,500
This is plastic

1180
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:40,500
This is plastic

1181
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,500
This is plastic

1182
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,500
This is plastic

1183
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,500
This is plastic

1184
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:49,500
Can I say it or not?

1185
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,500
I'm happy to talk to you

1186
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,500
I'm really sorry

1187
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:55,500
I just received the company's call

1188
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,500
I don't need to leave first

1189
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:59,500
It's a pity that we can't attend your forum today

1190
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,500
It's okay

1191
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:04,500
We'll have many more opportunities to discuss the relevant issue

1192
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,500
The forum is starting

1193
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:09,500
The materials are ready

1194
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,500
You should get ready first

1195
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:12,500
Okay

1196
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:13,500
Thank you, Mr. Ren

1197
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,500
You helped me a lot today

1198
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,500
I'll take my leave

1199
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,500
Take care

1200
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,500
I'll take care of the rest

1201
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,500
I'll take care of the rest

1202
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,500
The forum is over

1203
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,500
Thank you for coming

1204
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,500
Thank you

1205
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:12,500
Mr. Zhang, you said it was great

1206
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,500
I'm not a man

1207
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,500
I want to show you a green design

1208
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:23,500
Mr. Ren, I was just talking to you

1209
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:24,500
I want to ask him

1210
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:28,500
If plastic and plastic are separated

1211
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,500
Actually, the environmental protection agency has announced

1212
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,500
You said Mr. Ren

1213
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,500
It's Mr. Ren

1214
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:37,500
Aren't you Mr. Ren?

1215
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,500
What? I don't believe you

1216
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:42,500
Mr. Ren is Mr. Ren

1217
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,500
Mr. Ren is Mr. Ren

1218
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:45,500
Don't make a mistake

1219
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,500
He said he helped me a lot

1220
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,500
He helped me to get a job

1221
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:10,500
Hurry up

1222
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:13,500
澳門先普京娛樂城994466

1223
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:14,500
Come

1224
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:15,500
What's up

1225
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:21,500
Hello

1226
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:24,500
What are you doing?

1227
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,500
I'm sorry

1228
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,500
Mr. Ren is really good

1229
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,500
But because of this

1230
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:33,500
He got a bad reputation in court

1231
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,500
Now I heard the word

1232
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:36,500
What kind of flower shop is this?

1233
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:38,500
It's a social service

1234
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:42,500
I'm going to help them to solve a case.

1235
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,500
What are you doing here?

1236
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,500
Go and get them.

1237
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,500
You have to stop them.

1238
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,500
Hello.

1239
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:58,500
He Dong, do you know a lawyer named Ren Guangxi?

1240
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:00,500
What?

1241
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:03,500
I thought he was responsible for some company.

1242
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:06,500
He asked me to help you.

1243
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:08,500
So I...

1244
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:13,500
But I'm not sure if he's recorded.

1245
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,500
How should I handle it?

1246
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,500
I'll go and get it.

1247
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,500
The two men over there.

1248
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,500
Go after them.

1249
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:45,500
Don't let them run away.

1250
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:51,500
Someone's over there. Let's go this way.

1251
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:56,500
This way.

1252
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,500
Where are the wild cats?

1253
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,500
You should have seen them running here.

1254
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,500
Let's go find another place.

1255
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:22,500
Actually, it's not related.

1256
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:25,500
A bunch of wild cats and dogs seem to be in a mess.

1257
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:27,500
I think they're just looking for a place to hide.

1258
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,500
I think they're looking for a place to hide.

1259
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,500
I think they're looking for a place to hide.

1260
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,500
I think they're looking for a place to hide.

1261
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:36,500
A bunch of wild cats and dogs seem to be in a mess.

1262
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:08,500
My heart hurts but it won't forget

1263
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:10,500
The two men over there.

1264
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,500
Actually, it's not related.

1265
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:15,500
A bunch of wild cats and dogs seem to be in a mess.

1266
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,500
You seem to be familiar with this place.

1267
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,500
Did you want to come with Hua Tuo before?

1268
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,500
This place is so expensive.

1269
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:05,500
I remember this place.

1270
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:22,500
You had a piano in the beginning, right?

1271
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,500
I remember there was a girl playing the piano in front of you.

1272
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,500
Who do you think she is?

1273
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,500
I just heard that melody.

1274
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,500
I'm familiar with it.

1275
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,500
What should we do now?

1276
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,500
The door is locked.

1277
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,500
But Tuo is waiting for us.

1278
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,500
That's strange.

1279
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:13,500
I've never felt this way before.

1280
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,500
That's strange.

1281
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:34,500
I've never felt this way before.

1282
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:43,500
This place may be important to me for the past six years.

1283
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,500
What is this?

1284
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,500
Do you know anything about their existence?

1285
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:15,100
I arrived here because I had a coffee.

1286
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:22,500
My friend told me to come over.

1287
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:29,500
I have been a customer this old.

1288
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:32,500
I'm not sure if I'll be able to get back to school.

1289
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,500
Should I come?

1290
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:39,500
Liang Muzhen, Liang Mijing, the first student in the college,

1291
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,500
is in Bintong.

1292
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:42,500
The college is in Bintong?

1293
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:43,500
Yes.

1294
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,500
I've seen you before.

1295
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:50,500
You always appear in a magical face.

1296
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,500
This face looks like you.

1297
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,500
After you've lost your memory,

1298
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,500
you don't seem to be in a real relationship.

1299
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:57,500
Do you know each other?

1300
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,500
No, only you.

1301
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:01,500
I only see you.

1302
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:04,500
We've been through a lot of things because of Meng Hua.

1303
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:08,500
I want to say that I'll ask you to apologize to her tomorrow.

1304
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:11,500
Liang Muxing,

1305
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:13,500
do you want to sleep in this room?

1306
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:15,500
No, this is life.

1307
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:16,500
Your previous job is to save people,

1308
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,500
but you're now killing people and don't care about...

1309
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:20,500
This matter is only in this way.

1310
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,500
Muzhen,

1311
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:25,500
I've been to the hospital for some surgery.

1312
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,500
I'll see you tomorrow.

1313
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:30,500
This question has been in my heart for six years.

1314
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:32,500
I want to ask you in person.

1315
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,500
Why did you do that?

1316
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:42,500
Why did you abandon a man who would do anything for you?

1317
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:44,500
No one can do that.

1318
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,500
Unless you don't love him enough.

1319
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:58,500
I'm sorry.
