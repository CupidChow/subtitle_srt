1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Next, I will broadcast for you

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Next time, happy

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This is Pandora's box

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I don't know if it's good or bad

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But I can be sure that

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It represents many things now

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's a person who is important to you

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
As for whether to open

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Or decide for yourself

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Why do you have to be so upset

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
For those past memories

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That you are so depressed

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You don't deserve it

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
How could I have this secret

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
To marry her?

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You can

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Six years ago

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We all chose to lie to each other

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Sometimes

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Let the other person leave

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So that he can find his heart

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But it's also a kind of love

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
But I really hate you

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I lost the past

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I lost you once

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I really miss you

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This is all a lie

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I want to be with you

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Why do you do this

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Why me

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I want you to know

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Find my memory is my heart

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But it will become your heart

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
He remembers our lie

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I said it was a good thing

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That the light is back

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That kid who was listening to you

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
He has left

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I won't marry him with you

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What will you do

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Is it because you feel betrayed

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You feel hurt

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Or because

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You still love him

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Come on, come on

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Come on, come on

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Come on, come on

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Do you want to see me

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I want to take some incense

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
If you keep it, I'll go to the kitchen

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No, I'll prepare it for you

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll cook it for you

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What are you doing now

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Do you want to go back

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Nothing

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
By the way, when Xiao Le is recovered

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'll bring him to see you

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What do you mean by that

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'll go back to the kitchen

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What are you talking about

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Come on, come on

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Xiao Le, come here

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You want to eat some soup

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Come here

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Thank you

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm sorry

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
See you in the village

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
See you

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Bye

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
See you

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Come

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
See you

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm almost there

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What do you mean

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You don't know

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You're so big and big

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You really don't know

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I don't want to tell you

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You're so big and big

81
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You're so big

82
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You don't know what I'm talking about

83
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I don't know what you're talking about

84
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You don't know

85
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You're so big and big

86
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You really don't know

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Come on, go

88
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What are you talking about

89
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You're so nice

90
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Xiao Le is a kind person

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
She's a lawyer

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
She's a lawyer

93
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
She's a girl

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
She's a cook

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
How strange

96
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
How strange a lawyer is

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
How can she be so kind

98
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
She's not rich

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
How could she be a cook

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
How could she be so kind

101
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What a big man

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:05:03,140
Normally during Korean holidays,

103
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:14,580
General Manager Hong Hong will play preliminaries with the following months.

104
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:22,560
The single method is officially signed.

105
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:30,200
The first Dhان of theichts韓 film Vietnam broadcast,

106
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,200
Look at this kid, he's really a kid.

107
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,200
He's so handsome.

108
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,200
He's so handsome.

109
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
Look at him.

110
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,200
He's so handsome.

111
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,200
He's so handsome.

112
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,200
Look at him.

113
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,200
He's so handsome.

114
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,200
He's so handsome.

115
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,200
Look at him.

116
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
Look at him.

117
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,200
He's so handsome.

118
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Look at him.

119
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
He's so handsome.

120
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
He's so handsome.

121
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,200
In the past, we called him father of a foreigner.

122
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,200
I heard he's a foreigner.

123
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,200
He's a foreign-born foreigner.

124
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,200
He's so handsome.

125
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
How could you say this?

126
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
Don't say things like this.

127
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,200
We have never seen such a man before.

128
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
Look at this kid.

129
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
Look at him.

130
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
He's so handsome.

131
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
He's a big boy.

132
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
Look at him.

133
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
He's so handsome.

134
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
He's so handsome.

135
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:28,700
Really?

136
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,200
Yes!

137
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
You're so mean!

138
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
I'm so mean!

139
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
I'm so mean!

140
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,200
I'm so mean!

141
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
I'm telling you,

142
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
people around me

143
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,200
are just like that.

144
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,200
They're just like that.

145
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,200
They're so nice.

146
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,200
They're so nice.

147
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,200
They're so nice.

148
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
They don't care about us.

149
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,200
That's right.

150
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,200
Why is it so late?

151
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,200
Where are you going?

152
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,200
You're not sleeping yet.

153
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
Xiao Le,

154
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
we're leaving here

155
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,200
to a very far place.

156
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,200
How far are we going?

157
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,200
I just came back from Taipei.

158
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,200
You don't have to go anywhere.

159
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,200
Xiao Le,

160
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,200
it's time to sleep.

161
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,200
I'll take you to sleep, OK?

162
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
You need to rest more.

163
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,200
Your wound will heal faster.

164
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Come on, let's hug.

165
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Be careful of your feet.

166
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Let's hug.

167
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,200
What are you doing here?

168
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
You're going to take Xiao Le to the flower garden?

169
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,200
You're going to run away?

170
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,200
Are you going to hide for the rest of your life?

171
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Where else can you go?

172
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,200
This is the only way I can think of.

173
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,200
I'll find a way to solve the rest of the problem.

174
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,200
Why do you always run away when you meet him?

175
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
What are you afraid of?

176
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,200
Why do you always care about his feelings

177
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,200
from the past to now?

178
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,200
What about me?

179
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,200
What's my feelings?

180
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,200
Didn't you promise to take care of you?

181
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,200
I've always been there.

182
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Didn't I?

183
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Mu Chen,

184
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,200
let me help you.

185
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Trust me.

186
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
I didn't ask you to help me.

187
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Guang Xi is going to fight with me

188
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,200
for Xiao Le's rights.

189
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
He's going to fight with me for his rights.

190
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,200
He's going to fight with me for his rights.

191
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Guang Xi is a big lawyer.

192
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,200
He's also Xiao Le's biological father.

193
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
Plus, he's so good to me now.

194
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,200
I'm really scared.

195
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Xiao Le and I will be separated.

196
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
I should have solved this problem

197
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
between him and him.

198
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
You're wrong.

199
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
This is between us.

200
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
If you lose this time,

201
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,200
the only reason you're a single mother

202
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
and you're not stable is because of this.

203
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,200
They might think you can't take care of Xiao Le.

204
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,200
If this is the case,

205
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
we'll prove it to them.

206
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,200
We'll give Xiao Le a good environment.

207
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
How do you want to prove it?

208
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
Let's get married.

209
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,200
I know it's a bit sudden.

210
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
But I don't want to force you

211
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
to use this method.

212
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Please don't reject me in a hurry.

213
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
What will happen in the future?

214
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
We don't know.

215
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,200
Besides, Xiao Le is so good to you.

216
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
Even if the law asks her opinion,

217
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,200
the situation will still be beneficial to you.

218
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
I'm sure you'll understand.

219
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
We don't need to be afraid of people.

220
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,200
I think this is a chance

221
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,200
to keep Xiao Le by your side.

222
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
Give me a chance

223
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,200
to keep you by my side.

224
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Okay?

225
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,200
I'll be your wife.

226
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
I'll be your wife.

227
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,200
I'll be your wife.

228
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,880
Listen up.

229
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,440
Hang on.

230
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,960
Not yet!

231
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,800
I've been searching for you for so many times.

232
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,160
Think of some more.

233
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:58,680
Go away.

234
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,040
No.

235
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,160
Take a deep breath.

236
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:02,920
Okay, you are pretty.

237
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,520
Maybe the drinking will give you a jobs..

238
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,120
That's right.

239
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,120
See you soon.

240
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,160
Okay.

241
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,560
You still have something in Union

242
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,400
Gary

243
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,000
You found what I need.

244
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,920
Give it back now.

245
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,960
According to the Capital

246
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,960
The average living expenses of the mother is 28,000 yuan per month

247
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,960
And the average medical expenses of a diabetes patient is 23,000 yuan

248
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,960
Last year's health insurance company has 3,172 cases

249
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,960
The single parents have no chance to provide the most basic living conditions for the child

250
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,960
And the rate of failure is 40%

251
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,960
So, if Liang Mu Cheng and I take care of Xiao Le,

252
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,960
His monthly living expenses are over 50,000

253
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,960
He can't even raise Xiao Le

254
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,960
Boss, this is a health insurance company

255
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,960
You rarely receive cases like this

256
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,960
Liang Mu Cheng

257
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,960
Is your current partner?

258
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,960
He is a liar and a woman who is a liar

259
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,960
Six years ago, Mo Fei's father said he would hide the child

260
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,960
He promised to hide the right to have a father

261
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,960
And let him live a life of panic

262
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,960
If he meets such a character,

263
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,960
His father will be dead

264
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,960
But I think you are the winner in this case

265
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,960
This is the record of the bank of Liang Mu Cheng

266
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,960
He is a real estate agent

267
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,960
He is not fixed on monthly income

268
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,960
And even some credit cards

269
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,960
He is the most profitable person in the world

270
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,960
He is not a fixed agent

271
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,960
This is the most important relationship between you and the bank of Liang Mu Cheng

272
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,960
What is it?

273
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,960
I heard that you have thought about everything

274
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,960
I just want to tell you that

275
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,960
Six years ago, it's different

276
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,960
Even if you recover, what will happen?

277
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,960
You can't change anything

278
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,960
But you are still a father to Xiao Le

279
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,960
I think that

280
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,960
You should tell us

281
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,960
You are just an outsider

282
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,960
I have nothing to talk to you about

283
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,960
I just want to tell you

284
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,960
I am not an outsider

285
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,960
I came to Hua Ting Village tomorrow morning

286
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,960
I want to talk to you about Xiao Le's future

287
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,960
You and Liang Mu Cheng

288
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,960
What the hell are you talking about?

289
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,960
No matter what you want to do to Mu Cheng,

290
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,960
I will do it

291
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,960
I will never let Xiao Le go

292
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,960
You should go to Hua Ting Village tomorrow morning at 9

293
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,960
Liang Mu Cheng

294
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,960
You treat me like a son

295
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:30,960
You haven't changed a bit since you came

296
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,960
You don't want Hua Tuo to help you solve everything

297
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,960
Jerry, help me find a person named Hua Tuo

298
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,960
It's my destiny

299
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,960
I can spare your life

300
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,560
Gypnap

301
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,360
Help you buy a new 않는

302
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,960
I can't hear you

303
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,560
Yes. Stop

304
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,960
Why do you have thisiver Scalia?

305
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,960
Well

306
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,440
Press BUG

307
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,600
Link in the description

308
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,120
Shall Green

309
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,760
You have

310
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,760
Time for school

311
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,960
OK

312
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,760
Let's ask him!

313
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,660
Who's...

314
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,880
There's1200els

315
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,800
That's proof that I'm a lot better!

316
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,400
For the police

317
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,760
I'm not going to sign it.

318
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,760
If you're worried about your mom,

319
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,760
it's your job to attack Mu Chen's focus.

320
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,760
Then I'll tell you,

321
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,760
you who never lost,

322
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,760
you'll lose this time.

323
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,760
I've decided to marry Mu Chen.

324
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,760
After we get married,

325
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,760
Mu Chen won't be in the same position as you.

326
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,760
I'll tell you,

327
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,760
after we get married,

328
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,760
Mu Chen won't be worried about your mom.

329
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,760
But I'll become Xiao Le's father.

330
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,760
I'll give Xiao Le a complete family

331
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,760
and take good care of her.

332
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,760
You're just a father to Xiao Le.

333
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,760
Mu Chen is the mother of him,

334
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,760
who's been with him,

335
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,760
and you're the one Xiao Le will choose.

336
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,760
If I take care of him with Mu Chen,

337
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,760
you can rest assured.

338
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,760
I'll take care of him.

339
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,760
Are you done?

340
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,760
Can I talk to him?

341
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,760
I'll give you a sign.

342
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,760
You're not going to do it.

343
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,760
Why don't we do something else?

344
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,760
This flower...

345
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,760
This is the record of you fighting in Huatian Village for ten years.

346
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,760
You've been controlled,

347
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,760
and you've been in trouble.

348
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,760
You've been hurt, and so on.

349
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,760
Although you've been in the service and security service,

350
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,760
the police department has kept the secret.

351
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,760
I can control you in the court.

352
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,760
Other people will be responsible for your crime.

353
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,760
Your house is ten yuan a store.

354
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,760
Your father has been in charge of the past,

355
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,760
but you haven't paid him yet.

356
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,760
I don't think you can raise your family.

357
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,760
Xiao Le needs a special care for her.

358
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,760
We're still Xiao Le's guardian.

359
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,760
You're...

360
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,760
I'm not done yet!

361
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,760
This case is even more interesting.

362
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,760
I heard from Mr. You Zhiyuan and Xiao Le's classmates

363
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,760
that you've been crying for a long time.

364
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,760
Your father warned you before

365
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,760
that you should be above 50 cm tall.

366
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,760
I can say that you're a coward in the court.

367
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,760
Thu Yen! Thu Yen!

368
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,760
You hit me.

369
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,760
You hit me.

370
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,760
I can still sue you.

371
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,760
What are you doing?

372
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,760
Mr. You Zhiyuan, the law is not your fault.

373
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,760
The court is asking for evidence,

374
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,760
not for your own stupidity.

375
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,760
Mu Chen, don't be afraid.

376
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,760
He's just laughing.

377
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,760
Don't worry.

378
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,760
I'm calling.

379
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,760
Hello?

380
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,760
I'm sorry. I told you to call me.

381
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,760
I'm here to pick up the phone.

382
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,760
I'm calling now.

383
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,760
I'm calling now.

384
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,760
Don't talk nonsense.

385
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,760
Your family is in trouble.

386
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,760
Trust me.

387
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,760
We haven't talked about it.

388
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,760
I'll call you in two days.

389
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,760
I'll go back.

390
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,760
You're so annoying.

391
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,760
I'm not a coward.

392
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,760
I'm telling you.

393
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,760
You're a coward.

394
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,760
I'm telling you.

395
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,760
You're a coward.

396
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,760
I'm telling you.

397
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,760
I'm calling now.

398
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,760
Boss, we suspect you of illegal things.

399
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,760
So, this is the bathroom.

400
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,760
Please help us with the bathroom.

401
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,760
The bathroom.

402
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,760
It's not like that.

403
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,760
The police are coming.

404
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,760
I'm telling you.

405
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,760
If you don't want to go, I'll take you to the police.

406
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,760
I'll take you to the police.

407
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,760
I'll take you to the police.

408
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,760
What's the matter?

409
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,760
What are you doing?

410
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,760
I'm a coward.

411
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,760
I'm responsible for this.

412
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
You're responsible?

413
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,760
I'm responsible.

414
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,760
I'm not.

415
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,760
What are you doing?

416
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,760
What do you want?

417
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,760
Someone has been here for a long time.

418
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,760
You've been here for a long time.

419
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,760
Do you know that this is the law of the 46th and 47th law?

420
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,760
We've found out that you've been here for a long time.

421
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,760
Please come back and check.

422
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,760
No.

423
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,760
I'm telling you.

424
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,760
You're a coward.

425
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,760
You're a coward.

426
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,760
You're a coward.

427
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,760
Sir, is there any misunderstanding?

428
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,760
Yes.

429
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,760
Is there any misunderstanding?

430
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,760
Let's see what the court decides.

431
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,760
If you have the ability,

432
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,760
find a lawyer to defend him.

433
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,760
If you don't,

434
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,760
prepare a few hundred thousand.

435
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,760
Wait until the judge comes down.

436
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,760
You help him to settle the case.

437
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,760
I'm telling you,

438
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,760
I don't care about you.

439
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,760
I'm a coward.

440
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,760
I'm responsible for this.

441
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,760
If I don't,

442
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,760
I'll be a coward.

443
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,760
I'll be a coward.

444
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,760
We're telling you.

445
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,760
We're telling you.

446
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,760
You're a coward.

447
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,760
You're a coward.

448
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,760
You're a coward.

449
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,760
If you don't,

450
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,760
you'll be punished.

451
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,760
You'll be punished.

452
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,760
You'll be punished.

453
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,760
I don't care about the law.

454
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,760
You'll be punished.

455
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,760
Yes.

456
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,760
You tell me,

457
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,760
I'll be punished.

458
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,760
We can't reveal the identity of the prostitute.

459
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,760
I'm telling you.

460
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,760
What's the matter?

461
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,760
It's nothing.

462
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,760
I'll go check.

463
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,760
I'll be a coward.

464
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,760
Why hasn't he been locked up?

465
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,760
What's the matter?

466
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,760
I'm a coward.

467
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,760
I'll be a coward.

468
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,760
Why hasn't he been locked up?

469
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,760
According to my knowledge,

470
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,760
the number of prostitutes is 80% high.

471
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,760
The system is dangerous.

472
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,760
According to the law,

473
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,760
I've been in charge of the case.

474
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,760
I've been in charge of the case.

475
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,760
I've been in charge of the case.

476
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,760
I've been in charge of the case.

477
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,760
I've been in charge of the case.

478
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,760
I've been in charge of the case.

479
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,760
There have been victims of agitation,

480
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,260
serial violence, treatment,

481
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,260
drug education, and PeròAnt bailout law.

482
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,760
bloodshed completely.

483
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,760
And it's not getting off?

484
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,260
Here.

485
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,760
We've called the court to help.

486
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,760
Take him away.

487
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,760
Take him.

488
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,760
You use fake defence for hom Thyatopsis Tribum

489
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,760
and Acáx probabiliscus.

490
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,260
You're sl

491
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,760
Let's call it incisc█ nu spirituality.

492
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,760
There are both.

493
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,760
Why did you call me a thief?

494
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,760
Besides, the law is a proof.

495
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,760
Now that people are going to be in trouble, I want to be a thief.

496
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,760
Let's go!

497
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,760
Mu Chen, don't worry about me.

498
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,760
Listen, he doesn't care what you do.

499
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,760
No one can teach him a lesson.

500
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,760
Mu Chen!

501
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,760
It's none of your business.

502
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,760
I'll tell you.

503
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,760
I'll tell you.

504
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,760
You're a thief.

505
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,760
You're a thief.

506
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,760
You're a thief.

507
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,760
Zheng Guangxi, what do you want?

508
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,760
Why did you do this to the villagers?

509
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,760
Are you trying to make them suffer?

510
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,760
That's right.

511
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,760
You're a thief.

512
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,760
You're a thief.

513
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,760
You're a thief.

514
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,760
You're a thief.

515
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,760
You're a thief.

516
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,760
You're a thief.

517
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,760
You're a thief.

518
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,760
You're a thief.

519
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,760
I'm sorry.

520
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,760
This is my and Mu Chen's lesson.

521
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,760
It's none of your business.

522
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,760
I'm doing this now.

523
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,760
I'm just letting you betray my daughter.

524
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,760
I don't think it's worth it.

525
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,760
As long as someone cooperates,

526
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,760
Huatou will be fine.

527
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,760
I don't want to ruin our relationship

528
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,760
because of a woman.

529
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,760
But I hope you all know

530
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,760
that if anyone helps Mu Chen,

531
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,760
you're on my side.

532
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,760
Zheng Guangxi!

533
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,760
I'll find him.

534
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
Zheng Guangxi!

535
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,760
What's going on?

536
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,760
What are you doing at my place?

537
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,760
I'm going to borrow my son!

538
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,760
If anything happens, you'll kill Xiao Le.

539
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,760
It's not going to happen.

540
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,760
Mu Chen, welcome to my house!

541
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,760
I'm here to play with Mu Chen.

542
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,760
Xiao Le, you can't play with a knife.

543
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,760
Mu Chen hasn't taught you?

544
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,760
No.

545
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,760
My mother-in-law scolded me

546
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,760
to take the knife out.

547
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,760
You must use a knife.

548
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,760
Isn't this the carrot I made for you?

549
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,760
I can't do it.

550
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,760
I'm just saying it's good.

551
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,760
Then why do you use a knife?

552
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,760
Because my mother and I have been married for a long time.

553
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,760
I won't have your carrot anymore.

554
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,760
But I always say

555
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,760
that you must keep the carrot forever.

556
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,760
I always say that if you want to make a big carrot,

557
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,760
you must make a small carrot.

558
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,760
So you must cut the land and plant it.

559
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,760
Can you call Mu Chen to help you?

560
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,760
Mu Chen said I don't miss you too much.

561
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,760
Tell Mu Chen that.

562
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,760
What if Uncle and Auntie don't tell Mu Chen that?

563
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,760
He'll be angry.

564
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,760
Xiao Le,

565
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,760
you don't need to be a carrot.

566
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,760
It's okay if the carrot dies.

567
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,760
Because I'm here.

568
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,760
I'm going to stay by your side

569
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,760
after I marry Cookie.

570
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,760
I'll do anything for you

571
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,760
in the future.

572
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,760
I'll be on stage with you every year.

573
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,760
You're a graduate.

574
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,760
Don't say you miss me.

575
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,760
Because I'm here by your side.

576
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,760
But I don't have a father.

577
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,760
I do.

578
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,760
Xiao Le,

579
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,760
I'm your father.

580
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,760
I've said that

581
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
I've lived a life of fighting.

582
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,760
You forgot about everything I forgot.

583
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,760
You forgot Xiao Le.

584
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,760
Uncle and Auntie gave me a carrot.

585
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,760
But don't let Mu Chen hear me.

586
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,760
If he hears you're my father,

587
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,760
he'll be even more angry.

588
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,760
Don't cut the carrot for me.

589
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,760
It's okay if the carrot dies.

590
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,760
Xiao Le, I'm not going to make you angry.

591
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
I'm serious.

592
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,760
I'm serious.

593
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,760
Xiao Le and I will be together.

594
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,760
We'll never be apart.

595
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,760
Okay?

596
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,760
Uncle and Auntie, let me go.

597
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,760
Mu Chen, Uncle and Auntie are so weird.

598
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,760
He said that he's Xiao Le's father.

599
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,760
What's wrong?

600
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,760
You're not allowed to call my father.

601
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,760
You're not allowed to miss me.

602
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,760
I'm sorry.

603
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,760
In the past six years,

604
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,760
Xiao Le and I have lost too many things.

605
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,760
Do you know?

606
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,760
He thought that his father wouldn't show up again.

607
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,760
I can't wait for a second.

608
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,760
I'm going to get him right away.

609
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,760
I must make up for our relationship.

610
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,760
I'm sorry.

611
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,760
But can you give Xiao Le some time

612
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,760
to let her adapt to this matter?

613
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,760
I'm sorry.

614
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,760
I'm sorry.

615
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,760
I'm sorry.

616
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,760
Let her adapt to this matter.

617
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,760
It's my fault that I caused you harm.

618
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,760
You can create any problem for me.

619
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:35,000
But it's not about the matter of the

620
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,760
You can't let her go.

621
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,760
She?

622
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,760
I think you misunderstood.

623
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,760
I'm just treating you as a child.

624
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,760
You dragged her in.

625
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,760
You can use other men as you like.

626
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,760
If you're not afraid of getting involved in that flower,

627
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,760
I'll be waiting for you.

628
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,760
Let me beg you.

629
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,760
Please.

630
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,760
Xiao Le can't be without me.

631
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,760
I can't be without Xiao Le.

632
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,760
Please.

633
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,760
When I asked you not to leave,

634
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,760
how did you treat me?

635
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,760
When I asked you to answer my question,

636
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,760
how did you respond?

637
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,760
Xiao Le can be with you.

638
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,760
Marry me.

639
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,760
Don't misunderstand.

640
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,760
Marrying me isn't because I love you.

641
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,760
Xiao Le needs a mother.

642
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,760
Don't you think you're important to her?

643
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,760
Xiao Le is a child of her father.

644
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,760
But she needs to be by her side.

645
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,760
After marriage,

646
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,760
you just have to act like a couple

647
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,760
in front of her.

648
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,760
How can you be so stubborn?

649
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,760
You want me to lie to Xiao Le with you?

650
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,760
As long as Xiao Le thinks she's happy,

651
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,760
her parents' feelings, okay?

652
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,760
She doesn't need to know.

653
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,760
Why?

654
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,760
You hate me so much.

655
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,760
Why do you have to force yourself to see me?

656
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,760
I'm not forcing myself.

657
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,760
Because when I see you by my side,

658
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,760
I feel like I'm being controlled

659
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,760
and hurt.

660
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,760
I'm happy.

661
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,760
If you still want to see your little child,

662
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,760
all you have to do is get married to me

663
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,760
and take care of Xiao Le.

664
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,760
Otherwise, you can keep on dating me.

665
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,760
As for that flower,

666
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,760
I can just close it to you.

667
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,760
I believe you've seen my career.

668
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,760
I can send it to the police station today.

669
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,760
It has a lock and a lock.

670
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,760
I can help you find out.

671
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,760
Tomorrow morning at 10,

672
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,760
we'll report it to the Ministry of Revenue.

673
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,760
Can that flower come out?

674
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,760
Let's see if it will.

675
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,760
The first day of the trip

676
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,760

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,760

00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,760

00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,760

Next Healthcare

701
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,400
Changed you

702
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,760
here

703
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,760
Changed you

704
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,760
Changed you

705
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,760
Come

706
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,760
Come

707
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,760
New job

708
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,760
I was so hotter

709
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,760
No

710
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,760
The only thing I had

711
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:11,760
I took in the rveckli

712
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,240
for special

713
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,240
Okay, I'm fine.

714
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,240
Okay.

715
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,240
Bye-bye.

716
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:33,240
Dad, it's Aunt. What should I do?

717
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,240
How can I tell her?

718
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,240
I'll explain it to her later.

719
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,240
After I married you,

720
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,240
I asked my friends about the wedding.

721
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,240
I don't know how many times I've taken a weird picture.

722
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,240
I forgot to go abroad.

723
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,240
I have to be a good girl.

724
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,240
I have to be a good brother.

725
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,240
I can't think of a reason to be happy.

726
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,240
Dad,

727
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,240
I can't think of a reason to be happy.

728
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,240
I don't know how to explain it.

729
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,240
How ridiculous it is.

730
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,240
I don't know.

731
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,240
I have a reason to be happy.

732
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,240
Why can't you tell them the truth?

733
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,240
I'm not telling the truth.

734
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,240
I'm afraid no one will believe me.

735
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,240
I'm with Guang Qi.

736
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,240
Some people believe we're separated.

737
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,240
Some people believe I'm a woman who stole someone's boyfriend.

738
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,240
Some people believe I'm a woman who stole someone's boyfriend.

739
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,240
You're my best friend.

740
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,240
You should know your place.

741
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,240
I understand.

742
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,240
You're not a bad person.

743
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,240
Dad,

744
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,240
I'm selfish.

745
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,240
I want to improve myself,

746
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,240
which is for him.

747
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,240
I'm afraid

748
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,240
I'm afraid to tell the truth and I'll lose him.

749
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,240
I'm afraid that he will love me more than I love him.

750
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,240
I'm more than in love with you.

751
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,640
I'm so afraid that after I tell the truth,

752
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:56,040
I'll be like now, crying and willing to do nothing.

753
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,040
I really didn't expect that

754
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,240
I would hold your hand like this at this time.

755
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,240
Instead of holding you in a wedding,

756
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,240
I would hold you in a different man's hand.

757
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,240
I remember when I first held your hand,

758
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,240
you just came out.

759
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,240
I looked at you,

760
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,240
and I was scared.

761
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,240
I was still walking.

762
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,240
I gave you my hand.

763
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,240
I thought you could hold me.

764
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,240
But you couldn't hold me here at that time.

765
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,240
You could only hold me gently.

766
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,240
I didn't expect that

767
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,240
I would hold you so fast.

768
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,240
I couldn't hold you for long.

769
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,240
You still held my hand.

770
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,240
Look at me.

771
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,240
You were smiling.

772
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,240
You seemed to tell me

773
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,240
that you should grow up quickly.

774
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,240
You should face me well.

775
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,240
I gave you this world.

776
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,240
I'm not in your side.

777
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:45,240
I'm used to holding you.

778
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,240
I remember when I first sent you to kindergarten,

779
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,240
I gave you my hand.

780
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,240
I felt like

781
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:08,240
Suddenly, I felt that my precious daughter

782
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,240
was about to grow up.

783
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,240
She was so independent.

784
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,240
She was about to leave alone.

785
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,240
I thought about it a lot these days.

786
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,240
Maybe because

787
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,240
you are my only precious daughter

788
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,240
so I always thought that you didn't grow up.

789
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,240
I still thought of you

790
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,240
as my ex-girlfriend

791
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,240
who was going to the zoo to see me first

792
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,240
whether I was a monkey or a rabbit.

793
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,240
That little girl.

794
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,240
I'm used to doing things for you.

795
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,240
Actually,

796
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,240
you are already a grown-up.

797
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,240
You have the ability to make decisions.

798
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,240
I have made too many feelings for you in my life.

799
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,240
I'm now deciding

800
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,240
to let you make your own decisions.

801
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,240
I will not interfere

802
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,240
with your relationship.

803
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,240
You make your own decisions.

804
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,240
No matter you are together

805
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,240
or separated,

806
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,240
it doesn't matter.

807
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,240
I just want to see that little girl

808
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,240
who is always smiling and smiling.

809
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,240
But in the end,

810
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,240
don't be together.

811
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,240
Don't be apart from each other.

812
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,240
It doesn't matter.

813
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,240
I will take you to the United States.

814
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,240
Our career

815
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,240
is a relatively difficult problem in Taiwan.

816
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,240
I should also consider

817
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,240
the future of my retirement.

818
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,240
And

819
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,240
as a snowman,

820
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,240
I have to find a job in the United States.

821
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,240
It's not impossible.

822
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,240
Go.

823
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,240
Go and tell the people about it.

824
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,240
What you want the most now

825
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,240
is not just his mistake and understanding.

826
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,240
Right?

827
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,240
Episode 1

828
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,240
Welcome.

829
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,240
I want to go to the police station with you.

830
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,240
I'm going back.

831
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,240
What are you talking about?

832
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,240
I'm sorry.

833
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,240
You're not helping me.

834
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,240
I told you that I'm going to the police station.

835
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,240
I'm going to the police station.

836
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,240
I want to go back to the country

837
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,240
and ask you to take care of me.

838
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,240
Please.

839
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,240
I'm afraid I'll be caught.

840
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,240
You really want to go back to the country

841
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,240
and get a job.

842
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,240
I want to go back to the country

843
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,240
and ask you to stop being so stubborn.

844
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,240
Aunt Hua, I'm really sorry.

845
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,240
I don't know what will happen.

846
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,240
I just

847
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,240
I really don't want to be separated from Xiao Le.

848
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,240
But I didn't expect

849
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,240
to be able to get a job.

850
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,240
I'm really sorry.

851
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,240
Come.

852
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,240
Come and look for this.

853
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,240
I'm sorry.

854
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,240
You're also drunk.

855
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,240
I told you not to go back to the country

856
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,240
and you're still a kid.

857
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,240
The world is like this.

858
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,240
When you're not going back,

859
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,240
you'll have to come to our country

860
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,240
to do business.

861
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,240
You're always in the wrong.

862
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,240
You're always in the wrong.

863
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,240
What should I do now?

864
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,240
The mother-in-law and I are getting married.

865
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,240
What she wants is Xiao Le.

866
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,240
I'm so scared.

867
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,240
Aunt Hua, you know I can't lose Xiao Le.

868
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,240
She's trying to revenge me.

869
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,240
She's been trying to revenge me for six years.

870
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,240
I'm really sorry.

871
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,240
You're the one who took Xiao Le's father.

872
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,240
You have your own family, right?

873
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,240
When I saw you,

874
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,240
I thought you were a little girl.

875
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,240
You were also a kid.

876
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,240
You were always in love with Xiao Le.

877
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,240
So I told you

878
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,240
that she's also trying to revenge me for six years.

879
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,240
She has her own reasons.

880
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,240
I don't know why

881
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,240
you're so stupid.

882
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,240
I'm just saying

883
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,240
that you're also a good girl.

884
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,240
You're always looking at me.

885
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,240
So you have a chance to get married.

886
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,240
Mother, you're always in love with someone.

887
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,240
You're always in love with someone.

888
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,240
You're always in love with Xiao Le's father.

889
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,240
So you're always in love with Xiao Le's father, right?

890
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,240
You know what?

891
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,240
In the end,

892
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,240
when the women come to our country,

893
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,240
they all change.

894
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,240
They're all in love.

895
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:14,240
The End

896
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,240
Do you know

897
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,240
that in the end,

898
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,240
when the women come to our country,

899
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,240
they all change.

900
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,240
You're not like your mother.

901
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,240
Auntie,

902
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,240
I can't be with her.

903
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,240
You can see how cruel she is now.

904
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,240
Don't be ridiculous.

905
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,240
You're already married.

906
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,240
Don't you know?

907
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,240
You know that your mother is a coward.

908
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,240
You don't know that this is a real man.

909
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,240
This is the way to go.

910
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,240
He said that you're always in love with someone.

911
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,240
But all these years,

912
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,240
you've been in love with someone.

913
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,240
No matter if it's a person or a relationship,

914
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,240
I know you're comforting me.

915
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,240
But I really don't think

916
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,240
it's as simple as you think.

917
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,240
How?

918
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,240
It's really as simple as that.

919
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,240
You're so stubborn.

920
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,240
You're so stubborn.

921
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,240
You're so sensitive.

922
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,240
If you don't know,

923
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,240
you know that you're sensitive.

924
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,240
I'm sorry.

925
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,240
I'm sorry.

926
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,240
I'm sorry.

927
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,240
I'm sorry.

928
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,240
I'm sorry.

929
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,240
I'm sorry.

930
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,240
I'm sorry.

931
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,240
I'm sorry.

932
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,240
I'm sorry.

933
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,240
I'm sorry.

934
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,240
I'm sorry.

935
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,240
I'm sorry.

936
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,240
I'm sorry.

937
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,240
I'm sorry.

938
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,240
I'm sorry.

939
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,240
After the wedding,

940
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,240
you're no longer the only one who's dressed up.

941
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,240
Don't tell me

942
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,240
you're thinking of everything

943
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,240
but you forgot me.

944
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,240
Really?

945
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,240
I'll find the meaning of the blank.

946
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,240
Are you happy now?

947
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,240
It's none of your business.

948
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,240
I'll pay you back.

949
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,240
I'm sorry.

950
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,240
I can pay you back

951
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,240
completely.

952
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,240
But I can't

953
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,240
pay you back.

954
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,240
Although you don't care about me,

955
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,240
I still want to care about you.

956
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,240
I don't care about you.

957
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,240
I've retired.

958
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,240
I also want to continue to study in the U.S.

959
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,240
I won't come back inside.

960
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:54,240
I hope that when I see you next time, I will still be your friend.

961
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,240
What?

962
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,240
You are in my place.

963
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,240
I hope that you treat yourself a little better.

964
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,240
Especially you and Liang Mu Chen.

965
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:31,240
You should face each other very well.

966
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,340
Face each other.

967
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:38,340
I am not a bad person.

968
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,240
I don't want to be a bad person.

969
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,240
I don't want to be a bad person.

970
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:51,420
I will also be so happy

971
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,840
Baoxiao I might have a lot to be maybe

972
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:03,100
After all we're getting married tomorrow

973
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,340
What

974
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:10,980
fighter legs over that

975
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:12,820
that you tell me that I should save myself

976
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:15,580
That's what I have to do

977
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,580
I'm here to let you understand

978
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:19,580
I've been through so much

979
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:23,580
You're taking your marriage as a burden

980
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:26,580
What are you thinking about?

981
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,580
I'm thinking about it very clearly

982
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:32,580
I've never been so sober in my life

983
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:37,580
Did he agree?

984
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,580
I have to let him be your way

985
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:55,580
Wang Xin, do you know what I see now?

986
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:01,580
I don't think your brother would agree

987
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:06,580
In my opinion, maybe you don't hate him that much

988
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:12,580
Have you ever thought that you'd do this

989
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:15,580
It's because you still love him

990
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:22,580
You want to keep him by your side

991
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:25,580
Because you don't want to lose him again

992
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:29,580
I did all this to get a child

993
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:32,580
Xiao Le doesn't need a mother

994
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:34,580
She can't lose Xiao Le

995
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,580
We have to be together

996
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:40,580
It's that simple

997
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:44,580
I don't want to be a burden to you

998
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:56,580
You don't want to be a burden to me

999
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:00,580
You don't want to be a burden to me

1000
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:03,580
You don't want to be a burden to me

1001
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,580
I'm thinking about it

1002
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:11,580
Why didn't I agree to your proposal last year?

1003
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:16,580
Because I'm not sure if I did it right

1004
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:22,580
Maybe I'm afraid of this day

1005
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:27,580
I'm afraid

1006
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:32,580
Is there someone in your heart who has him?

1007
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:36,580
Even you don't know

1008
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,580
If we got married yesterday

1009
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:49,580
And you found out that your lover is actually Liang Mu Zhen

1010
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:51,580
Who said I love Liang Mu Zhen?

1011
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:00,580
Is there anyone?

1012
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,580
No

1013
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:27,580
Is there someone in your heart who has him?

1014
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:30,580
I'm afraid

1015
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:33,580
I don't know

1016
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,580
I'm afraid

1017
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:44,580
I don't know

1018
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:50,580
I'm afraid

1019
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:55,580
I'm afraid

1020
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:59,580
I've been thinking about it for the past six years.

1021
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:03,580
I've been thinking about it for the past six years.

1022
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:05,580
You know,

1023
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:08,580
I've been thinking about it for the past six years.

1024
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:11,580
You know what?

1025
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,580
In the past six years,

1026
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:17,580
when you suddenly entered the desert,

1027
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:22,580
what would I think of when you think about it?

1028
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:26,580
Are you thinking about the past?

1029
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:35,580
Sometimes, when you suddenly look at me with a strange look on your face,

1030
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:40,580
I would think that you were the one

1031
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:44,580
that I didn't know about back then.

1032
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:51,580
Now I've quit.

1033
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:58,580
I don't want you to be stuck in a place where you can be happy.

1034
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:04,580
Don't be impulsive because of your consciousness.

1035
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:08,580
You'll be buried in happiness.

1036
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:17,580
The wedding should be for two people to be happy,

1037
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:21,580
and then to choose the middle-aged man.

1038
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:27,580
I don't want you to be stuck in a place where you can be happy.

1039
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:41,580
Yi Qian.

1040
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:56,580
Thank you.

1041
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:05,580
For the past six years,

1042
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:11,580
I've been sincere to you.

1043
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:14,580
I know you're still here.

1044
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:18,580
I've been looking at you for a second.

1045
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:21,580
I want to stay here, but the time is too late.

1046
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:25,580
Everything is too late.

1047
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:29,580
I can't be like the past.

1048
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:32,580
I know.

1049
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,580
You don't have to explain.

1050
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:38,580
Why did you lie?

1051
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:42,580
You can't say that I've never loved you.

1052
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:46,580
Say that I've never been sad.

1053
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:48,580
I also want to say that

1054
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:52,580
I may still be a dream.

1055
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:56,580
You should ask me where my heart is.

1056
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:59,580
I don't regret asking about my love.

1057
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:06,580
My tears have always been there.

1058
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:10,580
You've forgotten my heart.

1059
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:14,580
I don't regret asking about my love.

1060
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:28,580
My tears have always been there.

1061
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:09,580
You're here. You scared me.

1062
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:12,580
I thought you left home.

1063
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:20,580
Come. Sit down.

1064
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:35,580
This is the problem that you can't avoid hiding in a place.

1065
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:39,580
I'm sorry.

1066
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:49,580
I'll change Uncle Guangxi to Uncle Guangxi.

1067
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:55,580
You mean Uncle Guangxi is more like a father to me.

1068
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:57,580
Is that right, Dad?

1069
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:00,580
Yes.

1070
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:05,580
What's wrong?

1071
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:08,580
Are you unhappy?

1072
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:11,580
No.

1073
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:16,580
Mu Chen, people know that Uncle Guangxi is my father.

1074
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:20,580
Look, why are you taking a picture of Xiao Hai?

1075
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:26,580
Here, Mu Chen.

1076
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:32,580
Do you remember that you've cheated Mu Chen

1077
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:34,580
and used his energy to get into the water?

1078
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:37,580
That's because I'm afraid of pain.

1079
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:43,580
Mu Chen will lie to you.

1080
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:49,580
It's also because Mu Chen will be afraid.

1081
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:55,580
Mu Chen, don't worry about Dad.

1082
01:01:55,580 --> 01:02:00,580
Uncle Guangxi has told me that he will be with me forever.

1083
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:03,580
He will come to me every time he has a meeting.

1084
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:06,580
Xiao Liao will be with me.

1085
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:14,580
Xiao Liao, do you really hope that Dad and Mom can be together?

1086
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:16,580
Yes.

1087
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:24,580
Mu Chen, why are you unhappy?

1088
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:32,580
As long as Xiao Liao is happy, Mu Chen will be happy.

1089
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:35,580
Then why do you cry?

1090
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:44,580
Sometimes, when adults are happy,

1091
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:48,580
they will be tired.

1092
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:50,580
I don't understand.

1093
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:55,580
You are the most unhappy people in the world.

1094
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:20,580
Dad, I'm back.

1095
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:22,580
I'm not going to be judged.

1096
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:24,580
If I have to, I'll be quick.

1097
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:26,580
And why can I be a little more careful?

1098
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:28,580
Someone is waiting for me to help.

1099
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:30,580
You're so strange.

1100
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:33,580
You were locked up and you didn't worry about yourself.

1101
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:35,580
You should blame yourself first.

1102
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:46,580
I'm sorry.

1103
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:48,580
I'm sorry.

1104
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:50,580
I'm sorry.

1105
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:52,580
I'm sorry.

1106
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:54,580
I'm sorry.

1107
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:56,580
I'm sorry.

1108
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:58,580
I'm sorry.

1109
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:00,580
I'm sorry.

1110
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:02,580
I'm sorry.

1111
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:04,580
I'm sorry.

1112
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:06,580
I'm sorry.

1113
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:08,580
I'm sorry.

1114
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:10,580
I'm sorry.

1115
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:12,580
I'm sorry.

1116
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:14,580
I'm sorry.

1117
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:16,580
I'm sorry.

1118
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:38,580
Sit.

1119
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:44,580
Happy?

1120
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:46,580
Are you happy?

1121
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:48,580
I'm not good at playing football

1122
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:50,580
Because I have a dad

1123
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:55,580
Dad is here

1124
01:05:57,580 --> 01:06:00,580
Little Le, is that Zhang Ma?

1125
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:02,580
She's a good looking girl

1126
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:04,580
She took care of me when I was young

1127
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:06,580
Hello, Zhang Ma

1128
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:10,580
But I can't take care of you

1129
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:12,580
Zhang Ma is a good looking girl

1130
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:14,580
Don't make her so hard

1131
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:16,580
I have some business with her later

1132
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:18,580
I need to take care of her

1133
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:23,580
Little Le, good boy

1134
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:28,580
Young Master, I've reminded her of my wife

1135
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:31,580
But she hasn't come yet

1136
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:33,580
She wants me to tell you

1137
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:37,580
She thinks it's different from your marriage with Miss Liang

1138
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:40,580
Who told her to come?

1139
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:42,580
She wants to see you

1140
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:44,580
I didn't tell her to come

1141
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:57,580
You're married

1142
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,580
You're married to Miss Liang

1143
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:06,580
I know you're not willing to come

1144
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:09,580
But why did you come?

1145
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:11,580
It's all for the sake of the flower

1146
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:14,580
So don't do this

1147
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:17,580
I'll just say it once

1148
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:19,580
I won't say it again

1149
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:22,580
I'm not like what you think

1150
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,580
I have nothing

1151
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:27,580
If you want to be happy with anything

1152
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:31,580
You can't just keep on insulting me

1153
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:35,580
It's not like that

1154
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:39,580
You're acting with her in the flower village

1155
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:44,580
You're afraid of dying for your future

1156
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:47,580
Why should I believe you?

1157
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:51,580
It doesn't matter who you want to think about

1158
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:54,580
But please remember

1159
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:57,580
I have to keep you by my side

1160
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:01,580
And this ring only reminds you of yourself

1161
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:03,580
You're my wife

1162
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,580
My little mother

1163
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:07,580
Remember

1164
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:09,580
Why would I marry you?

1165
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:11,580
Because you're my child's daughter

1166
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:14,580
Otherwise, I wouldn't want to

1167
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:33,580
Hello, what do you want to do?

1168
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:40,580
Excuse me, I need to get my ID card

1169
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:44,580
What?

1170
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:46,580
Come here to be my family

1171
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:50,580
Excuse me, I really need two people

1172
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:53,580
Are you tired?

1173
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:55,580
No, I'm fine

1174
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:57,580
I'm fine

1175
01:08:57,580 --> 01:08:59,580
I'm fine

1176
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:02,580
Are you tired?

1177
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:04,580
It's your turn

1178
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:13,580
I'm so happy

1179
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:19,580
So you're willing to let me go?

1180
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:24,580
Mrs. Ren, the first thing you care about

1181
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:26,580
Is the Chinese song

1182
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:28,580
You promised me

1183
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:33,580
You're so familiar with this picture

1184
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:38,580
Six years ago, you went to the date with the flower

1185
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:43,580
Six years later, you still married me

1186
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:52,580
You're married to your ex-wife

1187
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:54,580
Mrs. Ren

1188
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:56,580
And

1189
01:09:57,580 --> 01:10:00,580
This is your new home

1190
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:15,580
Xiaole, Dad is going to work

1191
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:17,580
You can go home with your parents

1192
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,580
I'm waiting for you

1193
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:23,580
Be good, you'll be back soon

1194
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:25,580
I'll go to find you

1195
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:29,580
I'm going to find you

1196
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:35,580
Dad, you're going with me

1197
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:37,580
I'm going with my parents

1198
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:48,580
Brother, it's okay

1199
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:50,580
Dad, I'm your family

1200
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,580
He's going to be a father

1201
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:57,580
Don't be so surprised

1202
01:10:57,580 --> 01:11:00,580
For Xiaole, you have to get used to the future

1203
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:23,580
We're married

1204
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:26,580
Maybe I can be your wife

1205
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:29,580
I don't believe in what I care about

1206
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:32,580
You know, I'm the most important friend

1207
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:37,580
I just realized that I hate being so impulsive

1208
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:40,580
Minna, you're going to the date with your parents

1209
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:43,580
I said I don't care about my parents

1210
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:45,580
You're so stubborn

1211
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:48,580
I'll use the way of men to solve it

1212
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:50,580
You want something black, justI want it

1213
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:52,580
Stop moroning

1214
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:57,580
What do you want?

1215
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:59,580
What's going on?

1216
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:01,580
ле

1217
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:04,020
What sort of ID is this?

1218
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:08,580
Is this evidence yours?

1219
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:10,120
I can't do anything about it

1220
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:11,780
I really hate such a thing

1221
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:12,780
You said it was for my own good

1222
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:14,880
The most important thing is...

1223
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,380
Guangxi, your dad will help you with the surgery

1224
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:19,780
I know my son's personality better than anyone

1225
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:21,580
I don't need you to explain it to him

1226
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:24,680
Where's Liu Xiangyi?

1227
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:25,780
I'm here to ask Chen Ma

1228
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:27,580
Where should I stay today?

1229
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:28,980
What do you think?

1230
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:30,580
Can you hear me?

1231
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,080
We just got married

1232
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:35,580
You should celebrate it

1233
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:37,980
I'll go to the pool tonight

1234
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:41,580
Let's take a break

1235
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:44,580
You're the one who treated me like this

1236
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:46,580
That's why we're together

1237
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:10,580
I love you

1238
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:24,580
I love you

1239
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:35,580
I love you

1240
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:39,580
I love you

1241
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:09,580
I love you
