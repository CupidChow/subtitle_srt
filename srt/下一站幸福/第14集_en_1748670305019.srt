1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The next episode

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Get ready to write a letter and go to the operating room

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Help me to take the surgery

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
No, Miss, please go to the operating room

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That's Wei Shi

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This is Xiao Le's mother, Yang Mu Chen

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We stayed at her house when we were in Huatian Village

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
How is Xiao Le?

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
How is Xiao Le?

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We've already cleared the wound

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The doctor is now in the operating room to take the surgery

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
There may be a surgery to be performed

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm Ou Xinxie, I can write to Xiao Le

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You can't write to her, you can only write to Qin

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
If you have any questions, please ask Ou Xinxie

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm Ou Xinxie, I can write to Qin

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Don't worry, she can't write to Qin

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Let me go

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Miss, I'll send you to the operating room

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Miss

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Xiao Le, I'm counting on you

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Miss, I'll send you to the operating room

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Miss

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Xiao Le, I'm counting on you

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm Bi Xinxue, why can't I donate?

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm more suitable than to withdraw

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It turns out that

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Gu Xin is so fond of Xiao Le

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's because of Tian Xin

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
They were originally a pair of fathers

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
They were born to be brothers

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
They were born to be brothers

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
They were born to be brothers

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
They were born to be brothers

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
They were originally a pair of fathers

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Let me go

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Xiao Le, come on

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
There are many people outside worrying about you

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
There are mom and uncle

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Don't you really want to see him?

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He also wants to see you

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So you must be fine

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Come on, do you know?

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm sorry

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Come on, drink it

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm not cold

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Tian Qi-len, what if you get a cold?

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You have to take care of yourself first

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Guangxi, when did you become so considerate?

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You care so much about Miss Fang Dong

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Mom, I'm not just Fang Dong

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He's still my friend

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I've been with Xiao Le since I was in Hua Tian Village

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You've made me change a lot

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm not afraid of you

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Miss Dong, how is it?

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The operation is successful

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We'll take the ordinary ward

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and treat the family and friends who are in the hospital

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And also, Xiao Fan's father-in-law will be in the care center

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Remember to go to him

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Thank you

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll go to the hospital

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Go to the hospital and take care of the operation

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
No need

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm very busy

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'll trouble him when he comes out of the military center

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He has a lot of blood

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You should take more rest

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Wait for me in the hospital

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Mom, where's you?

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Since Xiao Le is fine, I'll go back later

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Right, Guangxi

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'll take you home to see the examination list

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Okay

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Come

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The most exciting game on the line

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Ma Jiang Hu Le

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Ma Jiang Hu Le 2

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The Queen of the Award

81
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The King of the Reward

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The King of the Reward

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The King of the Reward

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The King of the Reward

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The King of the Reward

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The King of the Reward

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The King of the Reward

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The King of the Reward

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The King of the Reward

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The King of the Reward

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The King of the Reward

92
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The King of the Reward

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The King of the Reward

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The King of the Reward

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The King of the Reward

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The King of the Reward

97
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The King of the Reward

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The King of the Reward

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The King of the Reward

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The King of the Reward

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The King of the Reward

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I didn't expect that in six years

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Guangxi would still meet you

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
This is a dream

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
He has left Hua Tian Village

106
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
We two

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
are strangers

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I was wondering

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
why he was fighting for a group of villagers

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
to see the contract

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Now I finally understand

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It was all because of you

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Why do you change

114
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Guangxi's life every time you appear?

115
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I didn't change anything

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I have a sense of justice

117
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I am willing to help others

118
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's his nature

119
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I am happy now

120
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Please don't worry

121
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You mean Hua Tuoye?

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I remember

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Six years ago

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He helped you in the investigation

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You two are now together

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You two are already in a relationship

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
He is Xiao Le's father

128
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I didn't expect that

129
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Since you are so complicated

130
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You are the one who is so unscrupulous

131
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You are the one who makes a child

132
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
No matter what you say

133
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I still want to thank you

134
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Thank you for bringing Xiao Le to the hospital

135
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I just accidentally got hurt

136
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I am sorry

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I am sorry

138
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I am sorry

139
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I am sorry

140
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Xiao Le has been in a dangerous situation

141
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He hasn't been discharged yet

142
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So he will wake up soon

143
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Meng Chen

144
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
When Xiao Le is discharged

145
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I will prepare some food for Xiao Le

146
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But he will recover soon

147
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's all your fault

148
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You are my mother's

149
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You should be the one who is so considerate to Xiao Le

150
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You are so shameless

151
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You are so shameless

152
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Miss Hu Shi

153
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Please ask where is Dr. He?

154
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
He is in the hospital

155
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
He will discuss with other doctors

156
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
After Xiao Le is discharged

157
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
He will be back soon

158
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Thank you

159
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Can you take a look at Xiao Le?

160
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I will go out for a while

161
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I am sorry

162
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You should know

163
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Xiao Le is 5 years old when I left Guangxi

164
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Why are you lying to me?

165
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I didn't expect

166
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You knew that Xiao Le was in a situation to leave Guangxi

167
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What are you thinking about?

168
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Xiao Le is my only one

169
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I decided to leave him

170
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I never asked him to take responsibility

171
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So I have nothing to do with him

172
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
If you are not in Guangxi

173
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Why are you in his little child?

174
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Because I need someone to accompany me

175
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I have been a couple since I was a child

176
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Xiao Le suddenly left me

177
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I don't know where he went

178
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I need someone who will not leave my family

179
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
To be with me

180
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Don't you think you are too selfish?

181
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Guangxi has the power to know Xiao Le is in there

182
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Tell him then

183
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What can Guangxi give Xiao Le?

184
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You just have to let the situation go

185
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You are a doctor of a child

186
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You must know Xiao Le better than me

187
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Xiao Le is still a child

188
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
How can he understand

189
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Why can't his father marry another woman

190
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
To be with his own mother?

191
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You are getting married

192
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You will have your own child in the future

193
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You think of Guangxi

194
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
How much can you share your love for Xiao Le?

195
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Without a child

196
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You will be satisfied with such a incomplete love

197
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Why should I let Xiao Le bear the burden?

198
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Why do you want your child to live in such an environment?

199
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What about Guangxi?

200
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
How can I take this secret to marry him?

201
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You can

202
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Six years ago, we all chose to lie to him

203
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You never told him

204
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Everything that happened in the past

205
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Isn't it?

206
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I know you have re-established his life

207
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's definitely for his own good

208
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So he can have such a perfect life now

209
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Xiao Le and I

210
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Come from his past

211
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Let's stay there

212
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
No need to appear now

213
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Or his future

214
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What if one day he remembers

215
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
He won't accept that he has a child

216
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
No one will tell him

217
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
If one day he really regains his memory

218
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Xiao Le and I

219
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Are just so lie

220
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So you don't need to think about that

221
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Now we have our own lives

222
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Keep the reality

223
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's definitely the best way

224
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You can only keep lying

225
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You can only keep lying

226
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You can only keep lying

227
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You can only keep lying

228
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You can only keep lying

229
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Thank you

230
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Xiao Le

231
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You must recover soon

232
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Or uncle will be with you

233
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
How dare you say that?

234
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm not your uncle

235
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm your uncle

236
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm your uncle

237
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm your uncle

238
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm your uncle

239
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm your uncle

240
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm your uncle

241
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm your uncle

242
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
How dare you say that?

243
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Xiao Le is lying here

244
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's all because of you

245
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
If you see Xiao Le again

246
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
How could he run to Taipei?

247
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You promised me before I left

248
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You said you would take care of him

249
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Xiao Le was not like this before

250
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's you

251
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You knew you couldn't meet Xiao Le's demand

252
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
But you have to keep on affecting Xiao Le and Mu Chen's life

253
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Don't you think you are too concerned about the influence of Mu Chen and Mu Chen?

254
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I don't want to influence them

255
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Not only Xiao Le but also me

256
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I want Xiao Le too

257
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You want Xiao Le to come to Hua Tian Village

258
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Xiao Le, Mu Chen and I will welcome you

259
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
But please show your character

260
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You are someone else's fiancée

261
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You shouldn't be against people who have nothing to do with you

262
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And kids

263
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You have too many emotions

264
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I will treat you again

265
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I will help you save your life

266
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I will accompany you to the wedding

267
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Mu Chen

268
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Mu Chen

269
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You are back

270
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I am busy

271
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
This is the hand I got from him when I helped Xiao Le

272
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's just a pair of dirty shoes

273
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You should go back to Xiao Le's house

274
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
She is so happy to see you come to Taipei

275
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
She will be happy if you can give her the hand

276
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You can go back to your room

277
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Help me take care of Xiao Le

278
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I am leaving

279
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I am leaving

280
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You are a good person

281
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You are like this

282
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You are like a person who doesn't return the favor

283
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You heard what I just said

284
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I am sorry

285
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I thought my friend had something to do

286
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
She didn't come to be my wife

287
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
So...

288
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
But it's okay

289
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
As long as you are with me, we can be together

290
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
This is the most important thing

291
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Mom, why are you back so late?

292
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You were here before. Is there anything wrong?

293
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Mom, are you asking that kid?

294
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Xiao Le is very good. Don't worry

295
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I don't care about him

296
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I have something important to tell you

297
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I decided to get married three days later

298
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I am going to attend the education meeting

299
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I want to witness you two having a good time

300
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I believe you can forgive me for my decision

301
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
But is it too much?

302
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
The customer needs to be informed and the restaurant needs to be re-opened

303
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Don't worry about that. I have asked Xiao Ling to take care of it

304
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You can wait for a happy newbie

305
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Maybe the hospital will be different

306
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
The guests may be less

307
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
But this is not important

308
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
The most important thing is that you can become a husband earlier

309
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
What? Guangxi

310
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Don't you want to get everything back home?

311
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I just think that everything has happened recently

312
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I have to sign it in advance

313
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Guangxi, believe me

314
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
My decision is always the best

315
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I will never allow anyone in my plan to ruin my life

316
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I will make a good day

317
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Yiqian, you are right

318
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I am so sorry

319
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I will never forgive you

320
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I will never forgive you

321
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I am sorry

322
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I will never forgive you

323
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I will never forgive you

324
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I will never forgive you

325
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Don't be so angry

326
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Xiao Ling, you need to worry about us

327
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Yu Xia, you are a foreigner

328
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
What if you are caught by the bad guys?

329
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I am not anxious

330
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Wuchen, Xiao Le knows that she is wrong

331
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Don't be angry and don't tell me about it

332
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Xiao Le is right

333
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Wuchen knows that Xiao Le is too eager to find her father

334
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
So he went out

335
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Xiao, you are right

336
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's Wuchen's fault

337
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Wuchen, don't cry

338
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I am fine

339
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You need to be punished

340
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Don't cry

341
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Wuchen, don't cry

342
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
First Person

343
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,140
khi, I heard you've worked 8 years

344
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,000
You're obviously the probability of turning living abroad

345
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
By the time you were at my place, the houseubine

346
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
who wasそ um

347
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,400
So the hotel that was supposed to be booked

348
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,900
was not able to be combined.

349
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,700
Until the year before last,

350
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,800
all the hotels were booked.

351
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,700
So we chose to let Bink to manage the hotel.

352
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,000
The layout of the hotel is simpler.

353
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,300
As for the test,

354
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,500
I'll arrange it when I find the venue.

355
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,600
As long as you can successfully enter the wedding,

356
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
this is the best venue.

357
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,800
I found a hotel

358
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,000
that is very suitable for this wedding.

359
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,200
The hotel is very suitable for this wedding.

360
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
The hotel is very suitable for this wedding.

361
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,200
The hotel is very suitable for this wedding.

362
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
The hotel is very suitable for this wedding.

363
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
The hotel is very suitable for this wedding.

364
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,200
The hotel is very suitable for this wedding.

365
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,200
The hotel is very suitable for this wedding.

366
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,200
The hotel is very suitable for this wedding.

367
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,200
The hotel is very suitable for this wedding.

368
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
The hotel is very suitable for this wedding.

369
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,200
The hotel is very suitable for this wedding.

370
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,200
The hotel is very suitable for this wedding.

371
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,200
The hotel is very suitable for this wedding.

372
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,200
The hotel is very suitable for this wedding.

373
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,200
Hello?

374
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,500
Go out immediately.

375
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,700
Miss, we notice a call.

376
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,700
I was wrong.

377
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,300
Where did we just talk about?

378
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,000
While we were painting, while we were playing, right?

379
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,100
We were not alone in the mountains.

380
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,800
The sky was getting darker.

381
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,800
The little river...

382
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,000
They should have taken a rest.

383
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,300
My friend's special care for her.

384
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,100
She's in a good condition.

385
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,000
I just wanted to talk to her.

386
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,900
She wasn't awake that day, so I needed to leave.

387
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,500
I've been preparing for the wedding these past two days.

388
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,500
I couldn't see her.

389
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,600
It's a pity that if she hadn't been in the hospital,

390
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,400
we would have wanted to attend their wedding.

391
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,500
Xiao Le is a very cute and sensible little girl.

392
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,900
You're really different to her.

393
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,100
Congratulations.

394
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,900
You really can...

395
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,900
You don't think...

396
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,300
you don't regret holding my hand in the hall?

397
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,900
I don't know who I'm holding my hand in.

398
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:57,500
Holding each other's hands.

399
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,300
Why are you laughing at me?

400
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,100
I'm just...

401
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,900
What's wrong?

402
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,700
Maybe I'm just...

403
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,300
No.

404
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,400
Maybe the wedding is suddenly ahead of me.

405
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,500
I'm a little nervous.

406
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,900
You're nervous and normal.

407
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,300
It's just coffee.

408
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,700
You're saying something wrong.

409
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,000
During this time, I've been letting you prepare for the wedding in Taipei alone.

410
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,900
You must be very scared.

411
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,100
But I'm back.

412
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,800
Everything will go well.

413
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,300
Tomorrow, at this time,

414
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,700
you'll be my wife.

415
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:47,300
Don't ask me.

416
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,100
Just hold me.

417
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:54,600
Don't love me.

418
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,400
Be my lover.

419
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,100
Hold my hand.

420
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:04,700
I'll be my dream

421
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,300
for a day or two.

422
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:14,900
I'll be the hero in my dream.

423
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:23,900
Don't ask me.

424
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,700
Just hold me.

425
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,700
Don't love me.

426
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,500
Little rabbit.

427
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:37,100
You know how to celebrate the birthday.

428
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:41,300
Then, I'll go into the hole.

429
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,900
Let me be the hero in my dream.

430
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:55,300
Be the hero in my dream.

431
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,500
Thank you.

432
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,500
I'm really thankful.

433
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,500
See you tomorrow.

434
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,400
You must be very busy with the wedding for my mom's order.

435
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
Thank you.

436
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,400
You're welcome.

437
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,200
I'm really grateful for all the things you've done for me.

438
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,800
Congratulations.

439
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,500
I heard about Hua Tianchun.

440
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,500
You've been able to give your children back to their land

441
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,200
and also help them get the compensation for their livelihood.

442
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,200
This is the most beautiful thing you've done in the past few years.

443
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:00,100
Teacher, I've never asked anyone in the past six years.

444
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,200
What exactly happened before I saw it?

445
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:12,600
Recently, there were some familiar and blurred images in my mind.

446
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:19,000
Did I ever have some important things or important people I forgot?

447
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,600
Then, you let them disappear completely in my world.

448
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,800
This is Pandora's box.

449
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,600
I don't know if it's good or bad to open it.

450
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,400
But I can be sure that it will change many things now,

451
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,000
including you and the important people.

452
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,200
As for whether to open it,

453
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,400
you have to decide.

454
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I'm getting married.

455
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I know who's the most important person to me now.

456
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,400
I'm living a good life.

457
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,000
That's my choice.

458
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I'm getting married.

459
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,800
I know who's the most important person to me now.

460
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,200
I'm living a good life.

461
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,800
That's my choice.

462
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I'm getting married.

463
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I'm getting married.

464
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I'm getting married.

465
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Yang Mengchen, tell me honestly.

466
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Do we know each other?

467
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I have one last thing to tell you.

468
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
We don't know each other.

469
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
We don't know each other.

470
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
This is a magic that can turn into eternity in an instant.

471
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,800
I'll give this to you.

472
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,000
It's a lucky card. No one pays for it.

473
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
After you've lost your memory,

474
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
you're almost like a real person.

475
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Don't you know each other?

476
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
No, I only know you.

477
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I only know you.

478
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I don't want to see anyone else go.

479
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
So this time, I decided to leave first.

480
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
We have no meaning to her.

481
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Maybe we'll meet on the road someday.

482
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Just like strangers.

483
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Mo Zha!

484
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
If you're so important to her,

485
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
she'll come to you sooner or later, right?

486
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Uncle Guangxi can be Xiaole's good friend.

487
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
But he's not Xiaole's father.

488
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
No, he can't go!

489
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Let me go too.

490
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
This child...

491
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
is the best person in my life.

492
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I'll give it to you again.

493
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
When will you give it to me?

494
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Don't worry!

495
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
You always say that

496
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
you're the one who represents Xiaole.

497
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I should give you another chance.

498
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Even if you forget all the memories,

499
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
some things won't change.

500
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
You haven't been here for six years?

501
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Why did you have to suffer so much

502
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
for those memories?

503
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
It's not worth it.

504
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
After you woke up from the words you wanted to tell me,

505
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
you slowly told me that

506
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
you still remember that you were at the church.

507
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I didn't say I was willing to.

508
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
But I was really hesitant.

509
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I couldn't make up for my life.

510
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
God...

511
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
4466 COM

512
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Miss...

513
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
The End

514
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Hello?

515
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Hello?

516
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Mu Chen, I'm back in Wanlin Village.

517
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I'll call you back to use it tomorrow.

518
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
OK, OK.

519
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
You don't have to talk to me.

520
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
You have to talk to me.

521
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Come on, let's talk to each other.

522
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Hey, Mu Chen.

523
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I'll tell you.

524
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
The lawyer said that she wanted to marry a girl.

525
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I'm in a mess now.

526
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
But you're still here.

527
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I'll tell you later.

528
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
You'll be a big hit if you marry a girl.

529
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
You'll be a big hit if you marry a girl.

530
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
You'll see.

531
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I'll see.

532
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I'll take care of it.

533
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I'll take care of it as soon as possible.

534
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I'll tell you when the groom is ready.

535
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
We don't have enough time.

536
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
You don't have to worry.

537
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I don't want to tell you that I'm in a mess now.

538
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I'm in a mess now.

539
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
You know what?

540
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
You know that when you're in a mess,

541
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
people will be mad at you.

542
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
You'll be mad at me if you marry a girl.

543
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
You'll be mad at me if you marry a girl.

544
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I'll tell you later.

545
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
If he's mad at you, I'll tell him to marry you.

546
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I'll marry you.

547
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
What did you say?

548
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Did he say anything?

549
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I didn't say anything.

550
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
You'll be mad at me if you marry a girl.

551
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I'll tell you when you're in a mess.

552
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I'll tell you when you're in a mess.

553
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I'll tell you when you're in a mess.

554
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Mu Ze,

555
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
aren't you happy now?

556
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
No.

557
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I'm happy.

558
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Because...

559
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Uncle Wang Xi,

560
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
we're getting married tomorrow.

561
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
But I'm not happy.

562
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Because Uncle Wang Xi is going to be someone else.

563
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
How can you think like that?

564
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Uncle Wang Xi and all the kids are in love.

565
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
So...

566
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
they're getting married.

567
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
We should bless them.

568
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Why do you care about Uncle Wang Xi?

569
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Sometimes,

570
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
if you like someone,

571
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
you don't have to stay with them.

572
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Sometimes,

573
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
if you want them to leave,

574
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
if they're like this,

575
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
they can find their own happiness.

576
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
That's also a kind of love.

577
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Do you know that?

578
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Mu Ze,

579
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
don't you think about Uncle Wang Xi

580
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
after you're blessed?

581
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
You won't be sad like that, right?

582
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Yes.

583
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,080
Money,

584
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,000
money.

585
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Salt,

586
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
let's deliver it.

587
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Okay.

588
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
In light of epidemics,

589
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
COVID,

590
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
let's spread it across.

591
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Okay.

592
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I'll always be loyal to him, and always protect him,

593
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
and I'll always be loyal to him,

594
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
and always be loyal to him.

595
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I will.

596
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I will.

597
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Today, the piano teacher is playing piano with his friends in front of all the kids.

598
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
He's better than anyone.

599
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Really?

600
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Dad, the teacher said that we should have a class next time.

601
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I'll learn this song.

602
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Are you hanging up?

603
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
How's the piano?

604
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
What are you talking about?

605
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Have you forgotten?

606
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Even if it's a deal, you still have to send a report.

607
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Don't know it tonight.

608
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Wait for me there.

609
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
The piano teacher is playing piano with his friends in front of all the kids.

610
00:43:40,000 --> 00:44:04,000
When he was playing the piano, he was often taken by others.

611
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Other than the piano, he was also taken by others.

612
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
When everyone was waiting to see him playing,

613
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,000
he only used one piano, and he was so excited that he was burned.

614
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
That is, the famous piano.

615
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Who allowed you to play the piano?

616
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Who allowed you to come in?

617
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
You're too young to watch me.

618
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
It's easy to be fooled.

619
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
You've said that I'm the best at pretending to be innocent.

620
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I'll bet with my classmates.

621
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
As long as I win,

622
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
my classmates will buy us a meal ticket for a month.

623
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
What did you say?

624
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
For the sake of money, you're selling yourself like this.

625
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
For a fish, you've been fighting with me for a long time.

626
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
For a book, I was scared like this.

627
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
What's this nonsense? It's like a real one.

628
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Have you ever heard of nonsense?

629
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
See how you cut vegetables every day.

630
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
It means you can't talk.

631
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I've never told you that I'm so good at playing the piano.

632
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I'm sorry.

633
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I'm just curious.

634
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
So I'm a little embarrassed.

635
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Why did you say sorry to me?

636
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Do I feel so bad in your heart?

637
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Or did you ever play the piano?

638
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Don't be mad.

639
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I'm sorry.

640
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I'm sorry.

641
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Don't be mad.

642
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I heard you came early, not only to the city,

643
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
but also to see you.

644
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I have some questions to ask you.

645
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
But the answer is not important.

646
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
No wonder you found me.

647
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
By the way, congratulations on your marriage with Miss He.

648
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I saw that we were getting married in this church.

649
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
How do you feel?

650
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I'm glad to hear that you're happy with Miss He.

651
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
You look nervous.

652
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I'm going to marry you today.

653
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
You're going to marry me today.

654
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
And you're not the bride.

655
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Why are you like this?

656
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
You must be very busy.

657
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I won't bother you.

658
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I've tried.

659
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I want to ask you a favor.

660
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I've been waiting for you.

661
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I finally got you into this moment.

662
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Dad, don't be too emotional.

663
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
You'll cry when you get married.

664
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
She's going to come here soon.

665
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I'm going to marry you today.

666
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I'm going to marry you today.

667
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
You're not going to get a photo with me?

668
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
It's dangerous when we come here.

669
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
It's dangerous?

670
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
You must be very familiar.

671
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Because you already know many people.

672
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
You're like this.

673
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Master Yuan.

674
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I'm going to marry you today.

675
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
You must be very happy with Miss He.

676
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I won't bother you anymore.

677
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I'll marry you later.

678
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I'm going to marry you today.

679
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I haven't gotten married yet.

680
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I want to marry you tomorrow.

681
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I'll go and get married soon.

682
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I'll see you later.

683
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I'll see you tomorrow.

684
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I'm not afraid of you.

685
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I'm not afraid of you.

686
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I'm not afraid of you.

687
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I'm not afraid of you.

688
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I'm not afraid of you.

689
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I'm not afraid of you.

690
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I'm not afraid of you.

691
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I'm not afraid of you.

692
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I'm not afraid of you.

693
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I'm not afraid of you.

694
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I'm not afraid of you.

695
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
I'm not afraid of you.

696
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I'm not afraid of you.

697
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I'm not afraid of you.

698
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I'm not afraid of you.

699
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Get off.

700
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Get off!

701
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
What are you doing?

702
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Why did you bring me here?

703
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
You're going to die!

704
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Why did I bring you here?

705
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Because I want to ask you.

706
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
When you decided to abandon me,

707
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
you were in a car accident.

708
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I was suffering.

709
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I was only trying to save you.

710
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
How did you see me?

711
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
On this road,

712
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
where did you go?

713
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
How did you see me?

714
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I thought you were stabbed.

715
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I was stabbed.

716
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I was here.

717
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I almost died.

718
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Did you see me?

719
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Stop the car.

720
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
What's wrong?

721
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
What's wrong?

722
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
What's wrong with you?

723
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Are you going to pretend?

724
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
You've been pretending to be stupid

725
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
for the past six years.

726
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Do you know what?

727
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Your eyes

728
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
are really long.

729
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I can't remember.

730
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Yijie.

731
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Why are you here?

732
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Yijie.

733
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I forgot to see you.

734
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
He's not at home.

735
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
He's not at Huichang.

736
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
No one's answering his phone.

737
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Someone said

738
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
he left the church with Liang Mocheng.

739
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Yijie, there's a problem.

740
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I forgot to tell you to leave.

741
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Don't be nervous.

742
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
What about the fortune teller?

743
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Don't cry.

744
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I know.

745
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I know we hoped he would beА

746
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I can't figure out what the story of love is about.

747
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
What secret is it that keeps you from cheating on me?

748
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Do you know that I came out to solve it by myself?

749
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
You're surprised that I'm still alive, right?

750
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I didn't leave this message on the fridge.

751
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Instead, you sent it to me.

752
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I'm not a fool.

753
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I left it on the fridge.

754
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Instead, you sent it to me.

755
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Do you know that I almost died?

756
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I don't know, Wang Xinyi.

757
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Do you know that you'll stay?

758
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
How did you tell me?

759
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
You wanted to be with me. You wanted me to believe you.

760
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
But...

761
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
What am I begging you for?

762
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
If you really love me,

763
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
even just for a day,

764
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
you want to be with me until the end.

765
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
You'll be cheated.

766
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
You'll be cheated.

767
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
You'll be cheated twice.

768
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
That's too much.

769
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Six years ago, I was cheated by your ex.

770
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I was thinking about it.

771
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
I don't want to be cheated.

772
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Do you know that?

773
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
I really loved you.

774
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Shengnan,

775
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
let me believe this world again.

776
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Because I believe that this world is not too bad.

777
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I can accompany it and work hard together.

778
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
But it's also because of you.

779
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Let my dream be kept in the same place.

780
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Don't be so entangled with me.

781
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
You don't even know if you'll be alive tomorrow.

782
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Why tomorrow?

783
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Sorry, Shengnan.

784
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Look at this.

785
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
You don't remember anything.

786
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I once gave you a life-saving love.

787
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
But you don't remember anything.

788
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
You think I'm a fool?

789
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,000
After watching the group of people who are cheated,

790
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I'm in a time of your absence.

791
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Is it fun?

792
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
My life is ruined by you.

793
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
You feel sorry for me.

794
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I understand everything.

795
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Because you already have everything.

796
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
You don't need me anymore.

797
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
That's why I decided not to tell you.

798
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,000
You're the one who makes me live the life I want.

799
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
You are the one!

800
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I've been through a lot.

801
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
My illness can be repaid.

802
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:41,000
My life may be rebelled in the next second.

803
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
But I don't even have the right to choose life.

804
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
It's you!

805
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,000
It's you who should belong to my happiness.

806
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,000
When I face the people who are in control,

807
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
you...

808
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
You and Huatuo...

809
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
live happily in another place.

810
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Tell me.

811
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Without me,

812
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
you've been through a lot.

813
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,000
But... but I really feel sorry for you.

814
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
I've lost the past.

815
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I've lost my true feelings.

816
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I only know that...

817
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I'm a piece of cake.

818
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I've lost my memory.

819
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
When you were in the hospital,

820
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
you knew Xiaola was my son.

821
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
So you didn't let me help her, right?

822
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
You knew she was my son.

823
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
You knew she was my son.

824
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
You made her call me a son-in-law.

825
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
You made her see me,

826
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
and you broke up with me.

827
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
You made me tell her I'm not her father!

828
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I've been through a lot.

829
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I'm not related to our business.

830
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Of course you are!

831
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
I'm her father!

832
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I've lost my memory.

833
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
I've lost my memory.

834
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
But I can still remember Xiaola's future.

835
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
I want Xiaola.

836
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
No, you can't do that.

837
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
What if I do?

838
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
You don't agree?

839
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Just wait for the third law.

840
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Tell me.

841
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Why did you do that?

842
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Why not?

843
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Yang Mengchen.

844
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I want you to know that

845
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I'm lucky to have my memory back.

846
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
But it will become your misfortune.

847
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Hello, Mr. Du.

848
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Mengchen.

849
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Why did you cancel the wedding?

850
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
And why did you not see her?

851
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Mr. Du.

852
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
I forgot...

853
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
everything else.

854
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I'm not your father.

855
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
I'm not your father.

856
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
I'm not your father.

857
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
I'm not your father.

858
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
I'm not your father.

859
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I'm not your father.

860
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I'm not your father.

861
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
I'm not your father.

862
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
I'm not your father.

863
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
I'm not your father.

864
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
I'm not your father.

865
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
I'm not your father.

866
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I'm not your father.

867
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
I'm not your father.

868
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Do you have any excuses for money?

869
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
I just paid you five cents

870
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I'll go back to the job.

871
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
I have no excuses.

872
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,720
I admit we are all the things

873
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:08,720
we couldn't help you with.

874
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,500
Those extraordinary backstreet

875
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,120
must not be mentioned now.

876
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:16,680
You're not responsible

877
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:18,040
about the many years

878
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,000
we have been through.

879
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
You and以前 have been so good together, right?

880
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
You are now recovering from your memory.

881
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
It's a good thing.

882
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
I also know that you have to spend so much time with me.

883
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
It's hard to avoid the feeling of being affected.

884
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
But I tell you,

885
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I will understand your feelings when I get married.

886
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Are you done talking?

887
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
You really don't understand the situation, do you?

888
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
I'm telling you the truth.

889
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Ren Guangxi is back.

890
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
That son of yours who listened to you, he has already left.

891
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I won't marry you.

892
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,000
And I will tell you that I want that child.

893
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
What did you say?

894
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Xiao Le is my child.

895
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Do you want to be so surprised?

896
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Xiao Le is five years old and she doesn't want to be married.

897
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Six years ago, when I was with Liang Mu Chen,

898
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
you also met her.

899
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Can't you guess it?

900
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I will say it one last time.

901
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
I want Liang Xiao Le.

902
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I just want to say it to you.

903
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Do you really think that I care about your thoughts?

904
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Of course, I do.

905
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Guangxi, where are you going?

906
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
994466, COM.

907
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Do you have something to say?

908
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Then I want to ask you,

909
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
how did you decide to let the previous Ren Guangxi disappear completely?

910
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Because I really believe

911
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
that this is all for your own good.

912
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,000
How can I tell you that you love me more than I do?

913
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Liang Mu Chen has already left you.

914
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Tell me, will this be better?

915
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
You must be angry at everything now.

916
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Do you still remember?

917
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
The first time we met,

918
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I was right next to you

919
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
looking at you smiling at her,

920
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
giving her a lot of love,

921
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
changing her.

922
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Finally, for her crying,

923
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I knew that she had left you,

924
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
making you cry.

925
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
How can I say it?

926
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
At that time,

927
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
I told myself

928
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
that once I let you go,

929
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I never thought what the future would be like.

930
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I just want you to be better.

931
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
After all,

932
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
I really love you.

933
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Do you want me to tell you the cruel facts

934
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
and let you face it alone?

935
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
I really have no way.

936
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Because I love you.

937
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
To protect the person I love the most,

938
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I let her not get hurt so much.

939
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
You...

940
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
I really did it.

941
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
To protect the person I love the most,

942
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I let her not get hurt so much.

943
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
I really did it.

944
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Why?

945
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
What I chose is good.

946
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
What is bad?

947
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Why did you put the blame on me?

948
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Why did you let me live according to your will?

949
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
In the past six years, you have many chances to tell me.

950
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Including in the hospital.

951
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
You know Xiao Le is my child's wife.

952
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
But she's not here.

953
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
You know what?

954
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I'm the most disappointed.

955
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
It's you.

956
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
You knew me and Mu Chen's things.

957
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
But you chose not to tell me.

958
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
You know what?

959
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,000
I thought you were the only one I trusted.

960
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
But now I know.

961
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:51,000
The more I trust you, the more I betray you.

962
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
The more I love you.

963
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
The more I hurt you.

964
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
You know what?

965
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,000
The world you trust is destroyed.

966
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Do you know what it feels like?

967
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
But I know.

968
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:26,000
I must make you feel like I'm in love with you.

969
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
What's wrong?

970
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I'm too young to be my mother.

971
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
You have your choice.

972
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I have mine.

973
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
We are...

974
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
We are...

975
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Kuang Xi.

976
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
What you do...

977
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,000
is because you feel betrayed,

978
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
hurt,

979
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
or because...

980
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
you still love him?

981
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
I'm not your father.

982
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Why do you care so much about his feelings?

983
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
What's my feeling?

984
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,000
I should have solved it myself.

985
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Wrong. This is my business.

986
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,000
I'll give you a platform.

987
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Let's play another game.

988
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
We suspect you have illegal items.

989
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
This is the search. Please cooperate with us.

990
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Now people are going to be angry.

991
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
I want to take advantage of you.

992
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
I'm really sorry.

993
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I don't know what will happen.

994
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
You are a good girl.

995
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
You are a bad girl.

996
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
You are a bad girl.

997
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
You have a chance.

998
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
You should live with your father.

999
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
You should never be separated.

1000
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Okay?

1001
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,000
I hope you can think about everything.

1002
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Forget about me.

1003
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I hope you can be nice to yourself.

1004
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Especially you and Liang Mu Chen.

1005
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
You should face each other.

1006
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I'll have many chances.

1007
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
I'm getting married tomorrow.

1008
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
I want to be my grandson.

1009
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I'll tell you the rules.

1010
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
The most greedy person.

1011
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Like a falling bridge.

1012
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Comfortable.

1013
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Come on.

1014
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Come on.

1015
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I suddenly understand.

1016
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Everything is not love.

1017
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Come on.

1018
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Come on.

1019
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
There is no need to be afraid.

1020
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,000
It's not love.

1021
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,000
I'm sorry.
