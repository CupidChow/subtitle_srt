1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Next, I will broadcast for you right away.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,500
Next episode.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Do you know?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Once he was in the park,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
he was hit by a big rock.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Other than the game, he had broken his leg.

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,000
When everyone was waiting to see him playing,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
he only used that game.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
He was so excited to play a game.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,000
That is, the famous game now.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Next episode.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
In a day,

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
all of these girls, including his face,

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
will be taken away.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You've only seen me twice, and you think I'm a hypocrite?

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Is it because all the girls you know are so hypocrite?

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'll give it to you.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Thank you.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The meaning of the ending is to cheat your love.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This book is called The Flower of the Wild.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It helps the students to learn the library of the library.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Do you think he will be expelled from school tomorrow?

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Did I give you a picture of the real you?

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
As long as I can't hold it in,

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I will remember the plot.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Now, I will give you half of it.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Close your eyes.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This is the picture of the picture of your kiss with his friend.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Shut up.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This is the picture of your kiss.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Don't you know that I also bet with other classmates?

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I bet with this prince of the flower.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
He will kiss me in a week.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Liu Mochen, the game is over.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I've lost my mind.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I just knew that he took the book to threaten you.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Why didn't you tell me about it?

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Sorry, I thought you were still talking about money.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You just lied to him.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I will thank you for your kindness.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
If you encounter any difficulties next time,

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
you can tell me.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I will help you.

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If he dares to insult you again,

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
he will wait for him to save you.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I will.

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Is this a secret?

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Are you okay?

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I've forgotten about the past three minutes.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I still didn't take your book.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's okay.

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You are my savior.

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm sorry for you.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm sorry for my life.

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I can't help it.

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You are my savior.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You are right.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It seems that you are the only one who can do this.

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's a pity that He Dongmei didn't come to the show the last two days.

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I thought I had made it clear

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
about the money he was paying for the book.

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's impossible for you to take the book.

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm currently developing a new book.

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The best book is The Hall of Saint-Denis.

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If I suppress it,

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I should be able to enter the show.

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You are going to demolish The Hall of Saint-Denis?

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What's wrong with that?

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
If I can demolish The Hall of Saint-Denis,

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
it would be a good thing for me to have a good time.

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If you don't listen to me,

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
your husband will be the one who will pay for the trouble.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The Hall of Saint-Denis is obviously

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
the only place in your life.

77
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I've been here for so many years.

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I can't believe you can't see it.

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I don't know why you insist on the Hall of Saint-Denis.

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You can't demolish it.

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay, I've finished talking.

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Let's go to the ground.

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The Hall of Saint-Denis

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Go!

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Move up!

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Hurry up!

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
If you have the guts, you can go back to the playground.

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Who are you talking about?

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The Hall of Saint-Denis is a place of the WeChat.

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Don't go anywhere.

91
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The Hall of Saint-Denis is on the 9494466.

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Come.

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You're not the one who will send us to the water.

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Why are you coming in?

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm not coming in since I'm not taking you.

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
At least not now.

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Okay.

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'll go.

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
This is the name of the person you're talking about.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You'll know when you come to school.

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Wait for my car.

102
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
How is it?

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I didn't expect there would be such a person in school.

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The driver's car is not bad.

105
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm sure you'll get a lot of applause.

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
My daughter is not a good person.

107
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
She's a good son.

108
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm sure she'll be impressed.

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The Hall of Saint-Denis

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The girl just now is the woman of the union.

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm not interested.

112
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The Hall of Saint-Denis is interested in being taken.

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The school is in a financial crisis.

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
If we can't solve it in time,

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm afraid the Hall of Saint-Denis will let the unionist to work for them.

116
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So you're going to destroy the memories of the school you left behind.

117
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Why did I have to go?

118
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You should have guessed it earlier.

119
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You must have seen the Hall of Saint-Denis.

120
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Isn't there a way?

121
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The Hall of Saint-Denis

122
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Don't you want to guess the Hall of Saint-Denis?

123
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's simple.

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The unionist just returned from abroad.

125
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
If we can let her pass the college,

126
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
the union might release a new line.

127
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'll have a meal with her in a few days.

128
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'll accompany her.

129
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'll introduce myself to the other girl.

130
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Do you just eat?

131
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Or do you want to take her to bed?

132
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'll finish you off.

133
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I think if you're a mother,

134
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
you'll have to call your son a slave.

135
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
If you can do it,

136
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
you can keep the Hall of Saint-Denis.

137
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Tell me when you've decided.

138
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'll see you off.

139
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'll be right back.

140
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Bye.

141
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Bye.

142
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Bye.

143
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Bye.

144
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Bye.

145
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Bye.

146
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Bye.

147
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Bye.

148
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Bye.

149
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Bye.

150
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Bye.

151
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Bye.

152
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Bye.

153
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Bye.

154
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Bye.

155
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Bye.

156
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Mu Chen.

157
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You're so annoying.

158
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
How's your relationship with the chairman's son?

159
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Xia Yu,

160
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
don't mention that you're angry with Mu Chen.

161
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Mu Chen,

162
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
the school restaurant's restaurant

163
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
always follows you around.

164
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You call aunt Xia Xia,

165
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
and Xia Xi Lian Xia.

166
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You're so annoying.

167
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You're the chairman's son.

168
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
The chairman didn't send you back.

169
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
How could you

170
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
get along with a fated member?

171
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You...

172
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Auntie Xia,

173
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I have nothing to do with that Ren Guang Xi.

174
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
We'll never see each other again.

175
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What?

176
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's not about Mu Chen.

177
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Ren Guang Xi is my son.

178
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You hit him?

179
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yes.

180
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You're so awesome.

181
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You scared me.

182
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You're so annoying.

183
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You're so annoying.

184
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Get out of here.

185
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Get out of here.

186
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Get out of here.

187
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Get out of here.

188
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Get out of here.

189
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm your mother.

190
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Get out of here.

191
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Get out of here.

192
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm going to cry.

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You've been using the school for three months.

194
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You haven't passed yet.

195
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What if you offend him

196
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and ask me to do the same thing?

197
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Apologize to me tomorrow.

198
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I don't want to.

199
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You don't...

200
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Come on.

201
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You don't want to?

202
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Why are you still so stubborn?

203
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Ren Guang Xi is the chairman's son.

204
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
He told us to stop walking.

205
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You thought you were a little princess?

206
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The chairman's son told us to sleep with him.

207
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You even said thank you to him.

208
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Why did I do that?

209
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
No, what are you doing?

210
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You still want to play piano?

211
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Your dad died so many years ago.

212
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You're dreaming.

213
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You're so generous.

214
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'll tell you to sell it to you.

215
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You have to sell it to me.

216
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Get me a water gun.

217
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Liang Mu Chen.

218
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Come back with me.

219
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You're talking nonsense.

220
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'll run away if I talk to you.

221
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You're talking nonsense.

222
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You're so generous.

223
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You're so generous.

224
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'll call you back.

225
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Mu Chen.

226
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Mu Chen.

227
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Long time ago,

228
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,080
I could announce that

229
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,000
you are absolutely right for being a princess.

230
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Why did you take care of me?

231
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
This is what I want to make.

232
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It will be better if you don't have cancer.

233
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Your father will talk Obrigado to me.

234
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
We better be exhausted.

235
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
No, do it.

236
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,080
But if Bernard can thank you for

237
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,080
The first day of the trip

238
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,080
I'm going to the hotel

239
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,080
I'm going to the hotel

240
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,080
I'm going to the hotel

241
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,080
I'm going to the hotel

242
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,080
I'm going to the hotel

243
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,080
I'm going to the hotel

244
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,080
I'm going to the hotel

245
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:35,080
I'm going to the hotel

246
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:48,080
This is the song of the eighth

247
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,080
The first day of the trip

248
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,080
I'm going to the hotel

249
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,080
I'm going to the hotel

250
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,080
I'm going to the hotel

251
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:08,080
I'm going to the hotel

252
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,080
I'm going to the hotel

253
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,080
Who's in your eyes?

254
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,080
It's you.

255
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,080
Who told you to come in?

256
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,080
You can take the college as a place to study.

257
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,080
You can borrow or talk to anyone.

258
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,080
You can go anywhere you want.

259
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,080
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

260
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,080
I'm sorry.

261
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,080
You finally said sorry.

262
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,080
But it's a pity that the sword is useless.

263
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,080
Didn't you say that?

264
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,080
I'm leaving right now.

265
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,080
Your restaurant hasn't been used yet.

266
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,080
I told you to go to the hotel.

267
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,080
I'll give you a discount.

268
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,080
You can go to the new restaurant as soon as possible.

269
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,080
There's no mirror entry here.

270
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,080
I accidentally came in.

271
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,080
If you want Xiao Di to do it for the team,

272
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,080
can you please don't take that little girl?

273
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,080
Xiao Di, what do you know?

274
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,080
Who do you think you are?

275
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,080
You can sell it to someone else.

276
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,080
To make money, you can sell your true self.

277
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,080
You're like a woman who's open to the outside world.

278
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,080
How dare you come in here?

279
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,080
Do you know how big your business is?

280
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,080
You used your dirty hands to pollute this steel.

281
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,080
Even if you don't have enough money,

282
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,080
I can leave as long as I want.

283
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,080
If you really mind the car,

284
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,080
I can pay you with my money.

285
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,080
What do you want?

286
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,080
It's simple.

287
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,080
I just want to help you finish your bet.

288
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,080
Are we too late?

289
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,080
You should get on the bed.

290
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,080
Take off your clothes.

291
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,080
Why are you looking at me like that again?

292
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,080
Don't look pitiful in front of me.

293
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:11,080
But you still want me to take a step back.

294
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,080
Take a step back and teach you.

295
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,080
I don't need to help you.

296
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,080
You're like a toy.

297
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,080
You should let me know how good you are.

298
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,080
According to the rules,

299
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,080
no one has ever passed through any of your business.

300
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,080
You stole the money from the workers.

301
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,080
The workers at the school's restaurant

302
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,080
are only a few.

303
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,080
Enough.

304
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,080
Don't you want to hurt me?

305
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,080
Okay.

306
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,080
If I take it off,

307
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,080
you won't do this anymore.

308
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,080
Okay.

309
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,080
I'll take it off.

310
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,080
If you want to take it off, hurry up.

311
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,080
No one is here anyway.

312
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,080
When I take it off,

313
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,080
please tell me.

314
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,080
For survival,

315
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,080
you must show yourself in front of strangers.

316
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,080
It's so fun.

317
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,080
I'm the one who's left.

318
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,080
Please tell me.

319
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,080
How fun it is

320
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,080
to be left like this.

321
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,080
Enough.

322
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,080
Don't take it off anymore.

323
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,080
I told you not to take it off anymore.

324
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,080
I'm the same as everyone else.

325
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,080
It's so hard to bully people like this.

326
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,080
You guys,

327
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,080
who are you talking about?

328
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,080
I love her.

329
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,080
I'm so happy.

330
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,080
I'm so sad.

331
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,080
I'm so sad.

332
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,080
I won't forget.

333
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,080
I'm so happy.

334
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,080
You guys,

335
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,080
who are you talking about?

336
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,080
Who else is this to you?

337
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,080
It's a couple of people.

338
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,080
They're all here.

339
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,080
They're all here.

340
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,080
They're all here.

341
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,080
They're all here.

342
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,080
What are you doing?

343
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,080
They're all here.

344
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,080
You're not two people.

345
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,080
You're not even close to them.

346
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,080
I'm sorry.

347
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,080
It's your father-in-law.

348
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,080
You're so big and cruel.

349
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,080
Don't overdo it.

350
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,080
You're like a boyfriend.

351
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,080
The person you just bullied,

352
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,080
is it him?

353
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,080
No.

354
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,080
Don't mess with me.

355
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,080
I don't care.

356
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,080
Come.

357
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,080
I just pulled out two herzlich and Platte sting on me,

358
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,080
just like this.

359
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,080
Still lie to me.

360
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,080
Why did you hide just now?

361
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,080
Tell Sir,

362
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,080
if you didn't do this,

363
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,080
I'll be kicked out.

364
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,080
You want me to know

365
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,080
You still want to be with me in the middle of the night?

366
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,080
I believe you will be pregnant tomorrow.

367
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:28,080
Or do you think it's okay to have a child with me?

368
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,080
What's that sound?

369
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:42,080
You said you want to be with the chairman?

370
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,080
You are so weird.

371
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,080
Cai,

372
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,080
is the baby not home?

373
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,080
Do you want to...

374
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,080
You are so stubborn.

375
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,080
You want to be pregnant?

376
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,080
I...

377
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,080
What's wrong?

378
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,080
I'm tired.

379
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,080
Come here.

380
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,080
What are you thinking?

381
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,080
You are so weird.

382
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,080
Lin Zou Ma, if I were a ten-year-old,

383
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,080
I wouldn't be able to recognize you.

384
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,080
What's that sound?

385
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,080
Come here.

386
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,080
What's that?

387
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,080
I don't know.

388
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,080
It's been a long time since I've been here.

389
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,080
I'm going to tell you a story.

390
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,080
I don't know if it's true or not.

391
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,080
What kind of story?

392
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,080
Here...

393
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,080
a little boy died.

394
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,080
I heard that

395
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,080
the music department of Shenzhen University

396
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,080
has a professor.

397
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,080
He will take his son to the hospital.

398
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,080
His name is Liu Zipeng.

399
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,080
He is a professor.

400
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,080
He is a professor.

401
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,080
He is a professor.

402
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,080
He is a professor.

403
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,080
He is a professor.

404
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,080
However,

405
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,080
they didn't tell his son

406
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,080
to let go of his son's hand.

407
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,080
He suddenly passed out

408
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,080
and fell on the ground.

409
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,080
What happened?

410
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,080
I was just filming the sunset here

411
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,080
I hung up a knife

412
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,080
Then?

413
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,080
Later

414
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,080
This father left his son in the same way

415
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,080
Father, you...

416
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,080
Father, don't go away

417
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,080
Father

418
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,080
He didn't say a word

419
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,080
So I let go of his hand

420
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,080
He was only 8 years old

421
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,080
He was abandoned by the police

422
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,080
They didn't know

423
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,080
How to let go of his hand

424
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,080
How painful it would be to fall

425
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,080
It's like a wound

426
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,080
It's in my heart forever

427
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,080
What happened?

428
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,080
Your son died

429
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,080
He died after being abandoned

430
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:23,080
Many people say that during the late night

431
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,080
they saw a little boy

432
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,080
He was abandoned here

433
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,080
They asked him why

434
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,080
He said, because I want to ask my father

435
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,080
Why did he abandon me?

436
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,080
It's scary

437
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,080
Look here

438
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,080
I got PTSD after 8 years of being a father

439
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,080
I was in a mental state when I was young

440
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,080
I couldn't control my emotions

441
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,080
I was in a lot of trouble

442
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,080
It was like a life of joy

443
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,080
I'm not afraid

444
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,080
I want to see that little boy

445
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,080
Then tell him

446
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,080
Actually, his father loves him

447
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,080
I don't know how to shoot

448
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,080
When I was young

449
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,080
I would ride a big car

450
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,080
My father asked me to do it

451
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,080
He used to let go of his hand

452
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,080
My father told me

453
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,080
He was heartbroken and reluctant when he let go

454
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,080
But he hoped that I would fall

455
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,080
He should be scared

456
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,080
When my father let go

457
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,080
He must be very upset

458
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,080
But he hoped that his son would understand

459
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,080
He should learn to stand up

460
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,080
Instead of being on the ground to be with someone

461
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,080
You are so stubborn

462
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,080
Why did you tell me that it wasn't that little boy?

463
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,080
That sound is still there

464
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,080
I'm sorry

465
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,080
Are you okay?

466
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,080
You seem to have a fever

467
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,080
I know where you are from

468
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,080
What are you doing?

469
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,080
You are like a little bird

470
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,080
Sorry, I'm your childhood friend

471
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,080
But at least he met me

472
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:55,080
I can give him a home and a chance

473
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,080
If I can't live

474
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,080
I won't give up on his family

475
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,080
But on myself

476
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:12,080
You are not like a sister

477
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,080
I heard a special feeling from you

478
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,080
Your father taught you very well

479
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,080
The piano

480
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,080
It's the most precious memory of my father

481
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,080
He left it to me

482
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,080
From the beginning of his life

483
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,080
I have never played the piano

484
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,080
Tonight

485
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,080
I was too missing him

486
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,080
I played your piano

487
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,080
I'm really sorry

488
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,080
I'm sorry

489
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,080
I'm sorry

490
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,080
I'm sorry

491
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,080
I'm not a good person

492
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,080
So I'm looking at you

493
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,080
I'll go to the door

494
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,080
Wait

495
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,080
The key is here

496
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,080
You didn't tell me yesterday

497
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,080
You helped us to stay here for a night

498
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,080
You didn't ask me

499
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,080
I wanted to stay here anyway

500
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,080
After you leave

501
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,080
Come here to play the piano

502
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,080
Why?

503
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,080
You don't know?

504
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,080
The piano will break if you don't play it often

505
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,080
Although you play it very hard

506
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,080
But for the piano

507
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,080
From today on

508
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,080
You come here to play the piano

509
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,080
I work in the restaurant

510
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,080
I buy food for auntie

511
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,080
I don't have time

512
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,080
It's your business

513
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,080
You can't come

514
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,080
I'm afraid you'll be sad

515
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,080
When will I play the piano?

516
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,080
Until the piano is broken

517
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,080
Otherwise I'll throw you out

518
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,080
You're so mean

519
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,080
I didn't promise you

520
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,080
They'll be together

521
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,080
They'll break up

522
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,080
Mu Chen is back

523
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,080
He must be with the young master

524
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,080
What?

525
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,080
Mu Chen

526
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,080
Mu Chen

527
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,080
Young master

528
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,080
Young master

529
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,080
You're so kind

530
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,080
You're back

531
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,080
Do you want to go for breakfast?

532
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,080
What are you talking about?

533
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,080
Zai

534
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,080
Xiaolei

535
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,080
Who are you calling Mu Chen?

536
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,080
Miss Jiu Dian

537
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,080
I'll take you out for dinner

538
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,080
Zai, you're so mean

539
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,080
You're so handsome

540
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,080
Who are you calling Mu Chen?

541
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,080
Miss Jiu Dian

542
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,080
I'll take you out for dinner

543
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,080
Zai

544
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,080
You're so mean

545
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,080
You're so handsome

546
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,080
You're so handsome

547
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,080
I'm afraid you'll be sad

548
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,080
You're so handsome

549
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,080
You're so handsome

550
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,080
You're so short

551
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,080
You're so mean

552
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,080
You're so mean

553
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,080
You're so mean

554
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,080
I'll kill you if I see you

555
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,080
Thank you, Chao

556
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,080
Zai

557
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,080
What are you doing?

558
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,080
A-Xu

559
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,080
Stay with me no matter what

560
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,080
If he dares to do anything to you

561
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,080
I'll arrest him

562
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,080
Don't make yourself a burden

563
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,080
I didn't ask you to help me

564
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,080
I didn't ask you to help me

565
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,080
I did it on my own

566
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,080
You're leaving

567
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,080
Did you ever see him when you saved that bird?

568
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,080
No

569
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,080
So I think you don't need to see him

570
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,080
after you get rid of this kind of danger

571
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,080
Don't forget the date of the birth chart

572
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,080
Every night

573
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,080
Yang Mu Chen, you're not coming in?

574
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,080
You're sending the pervert

575
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,080
I'll go get it

576
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,080
I'll go get it

577
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,080
Dad

578
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,080
Wu Jiou

579
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,080
Li Haoshi

580
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,080
You're the last minute of the first-time lucky draw

581
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,080
You won't run away from me, right?

582
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,080
If Lin Zheng is the first-time lucky draw

583
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,080
he'll be the most famous star in the world

584
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,080
Even if it falls down

585
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,080
You're always like this

586
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,080
Didn't you say you'll get a final result

587
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,080
within the first-time lucky draw?

588
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,080
The photos are all taken

589
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,080
We're all very generous

590
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,080
Everyone?

591
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,080
Zhang Li didn't know where to find them

592
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,080
He went to the information group this morning

593
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,080
He'll be the one to read you

594
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,080
He won't be able to get the final result

595
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,080
The photos...

596
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,080
Where are the photos?

597
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,080
Zhang Li won't be able to get the final result

598
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,080
Zhang Li's lucky draw was wrong

599
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,080
We're the ones who can't get the final result

600
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,080
Right?

601
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,080
The school is waiting for you

602
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,080
You're a pervert

603
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,080
You're a newbie

604
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,080
Hurry up

605
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,080
Hurry up

606
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,080
Hurry up

607
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,080
Is there any?

608
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,080
Actually

609
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,080
You always sell pig feet

610
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,080
You're still pig feet

611
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,080
I know

612
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,080
You're the one who's booked

613
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,080
Which one do you want?

614
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,080
Is it Zheng Guangxi or Zhang Ai?

615
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,080
I want Zheng Guangxi

616
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,080
I know how many Zheng Mei's on his hand

617
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,080
You don't know

618
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,080
But I want to see the relationship

619
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,080
I heard Zhang Ai is going to get a final result

620
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,080
What?

621
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,080
Right

622
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,080
So handsome

623
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,080
Zheng Guangxi

624
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,080
Are you afraid of the crowd?

625
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,080
Zheng Guangxi is the first one to challenge

626
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,080
the top of the list

627
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,080
The two teams are not divided

628
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,080
I think everyone is curious

629
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,080
What will be the first one to be caught by women?

630
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,080
Don't be so bold

631
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,080
Let's make a public answer

632
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,080
Remember to be correct

633
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,080
Yes

634
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,080
You're so handsome

635
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,080
What's the bet?

636
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,080
The rule

637
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,080
Whoever bet the biggest, you can talk first

638
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,080
It's me

639
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,080
Don't worry, I won't let you down

640
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:19,080
If you lose, you'll have to run for ten laps

641
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,080
But...

642
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,080
you have to wear a mirror

643
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,080
Remember?

644
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,080
It's the one you bought me

645
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,080
You want to see me play the game?

646
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,080
That's right

647
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,080
Women can't be trusted

648
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,080
The police have told you

649
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,080
what happened to me

650
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,080
Jian

651
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:49,080
How much did you record the last time you drew Zhang Ai Li?

652
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,080
107 points

653
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,080
If you draw two girls, you'll lose

654
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,080
The beauty of the girl is more than Zhang Ai Li

655
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,080
I lost too

656
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,080
Guys

657
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,080
I'm going to announce the result

658
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,080
If I, Ren Guangxi,

659
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:19,080
swear to you that I'll post a picture of you with the beauty of the girl

660
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,080
The result is...

661
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,080
I lost

662
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,080
The beauty of the girl is...

663
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,080
I can't find it

664
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,080
People are always drunk

665
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,080
So I didn't get the picture

666
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,080
I'm willing to bet

667
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,080
I accept the punishment

668
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,080
The beauty of the girl is here

669
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,080
No, Ren Guangxi

670
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,080
Didn't you have to work in the office before?

671
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,080
It's a failure

672
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,080
It's because the girl is too difficult to do

673
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,080
But...

674
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,080
Let me discuss it

675
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,080
I'll let you do the next one

676
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,080
No, next one

677
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,080
I'm so tired of playing the game

678
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,080
I've met Ren Guangxi for the first time

679
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,080
I'm sure that

680
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,080
I'll lose the beauty of the girl

681
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,080
I'll give you the last goal

682
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,080
Run

683
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,080
Run

684
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,080
Run

685
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,080
Run

686
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,080
Run

687
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,080
Run

688
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,080
The study of medical studies in China

689
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,080
has improved a lot

690
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,080
Especially in the field of clinical experiments

691
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,080
We're very concerned about the cooperation of other universities

692
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,080
You can introduce it to me

693
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,080
My father told me about the college

694
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,080
I've been to many schools these days

695
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,080
So I decided to come here

696
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,080
You're indeed the smart and leading girl

697
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,080
who has the ability to cooperate with other universities

698
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:43,080
By the way, what's interesting about your football team?

699
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,080
That's right

700
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:49,080
It's a pity that I was kicked out by the coach

701
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,080
It's not fun

702
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,080
Is there a game today?

703
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,080
Why is the football team so popular?

704
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,080
Come on

705
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,080
Come on

706
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,720
Forgive me

707
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,960
Are you listening to me or not?

708
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,080
Can you hear me?

709
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,080
Are you OK?

710
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:26,080
You again? You're helping me to get my hair done?

711
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:31,080
You'd better go to the security check-up room and check if the body is injured

712
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:37,080
By the way, I'll introduce myself to you

713
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,080
I'm going to transfer to your university to study

714
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,080
The boss is here!

715
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,080
Miss Yu Jing, sorry

716
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,080
This is my son, Ren Guangxi

717
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,080
Ren Guangxi?

718
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:03,080
Ren Guangxi, why do you always make me look so familiar when we meet?

719
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,080
Let's be friends

720
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,080
I don't think Guangxi is a bad guy

721
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,080
She's so ugly that she can't even pull a sword

722
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,080
Is that woman a former member of the Huanyu Sword?

723
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,080
Yes

724
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:25,080
I heard Guangxi's mother wants to get together with them

725
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:31,080
But to be honest, the number of her parents is at least 21

726
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,080
It's quite a match for Guangxi

727
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,080
I think she's just talking to that pervert

728
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,080
That old man promised to have a ghost, OK?

729
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,080
When you were running, your back wasn't moving

730
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,080
So you didn't get to take the surgery

731
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,080
I suggest you take a break

732
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,080
Look, I'm fine

733
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,080
I don't need to rest

734
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,080
I'm fine

735
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,080
I'm fine

736
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,080
I don't need to rest

737
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,080
You don't need to rest

738
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:28,080
You can be a sportsman and take it as a bet

739
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,080
You're very childish

740
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,080
But also very childish

741
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:39,080
Miss, don't you think you care about me too much?

742
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:42,080
Are you interested in me?

743
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,080
Or me?

744
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,080
I love her

745
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:56,080
Don't pretend to be desperate

746
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,080
My heart hurts deeply

747
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:02,080
But I won't forget

748
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,080
I'm not her

749
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:06,080
Are you interested in me?

750
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,080
Or me?

751
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,080
Hello, Ershi

752
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,080
Please wait a minute

753
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,080
I'm here with my classmate, Fan

754
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,080
I'm here to see you

755
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,080
You're here so soon?

756
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,080
Don't worry

757
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,080
You didn't run away

758
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,080
But unfortunately, Niu Nan's role

759
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,080
She can't be taken out today

760
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:44,080
Although the drama was a bit off-limits

761
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,080
At least you've been leading the whole thing

762
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:50,080
I want you to continue to marry her

763
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:54,080
Then we'll be able to solve our financial problems

764
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:58,080
Of course, your father's sugar can be kept

765
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,080
How do you want me to marry her?

766
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,080
There's a bed outside

767
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,080
Do you want me to bring her upstairs?

768
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,080
Keep an eye on her

769
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,080
No matter what you do

770
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,080
Wow

771
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:24,080
You have a special communication with your mother

772
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:30,080
So the one you want to marry is me

773
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:38,080
President Fang, I hope I can teach you

774
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:41,080
As long as your father will give me money

775
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,080
It's that simple

776
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,080
You're quite honest

777
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:51,080
You've been so close to me since you were little

778
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:54,080
You're the first person to tell me your purpose

779
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,080
I appreciate it

780
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,080
Do you think I'm a successful person?

781
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,080
I can give you a chance to work hard

782
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,080
Can you give me a discount?

783
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,080
You're so active to everyone

784
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,080
Can you marry me?

785
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,080
I'll see how you'll be doing tomorrow

786
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,080
I'll be back

787
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,080
Let me tell you something

788
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,080
I'll go to a place with you

789
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,080
Where are you going?

790
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,080
I'm going to the airport

791
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:53,080
I don't have a job, I don't have to go anywhere

792
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,080
I'll go to the seafood street

793
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,080
I'll buy some seafood and go to the fish market

794
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:03,080
You're the best food for your life

795
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:06,080
seafood is so expensive, can you eat it?

796
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,080
What are you saying?

797
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,080
You don't understand

798
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,080
Men eat fresh seafood

799
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,080
But when they eat it, they'll eat it all

800
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,080
And they say

801
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,080
A thousand years of tradition and a thousand years of father

802
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:27,080
When you're old, you'll have a hundred years of father

803
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,080
Look at you, you're buying me a beer

804
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,080
Don't women like men this much?

805
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,080
Ma

806
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,080
Yes

807
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,080
How much do you want to pay?

808
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:49,080
A little, I'll pay two or three times

809
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:53,080
You're so stingy

810
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,080
I'll pay you a lot

811
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:58,080
I'll tell you, you can't afford to go out with someone

812
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:01,080
A little is enough, I'll tell you

813
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,080
I'll pay you more

814
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:06,080
No, you don't have to pay me more

815
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:14,080
You're not going to pay me more than ten people

816
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,080
Ten people, ten people

817
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,080
You're so stingy, you're going to pay more

818
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,080
What's wrong?

819
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,080
What are you doing?

820
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,080
I'm not...

821
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:30,080
You're not going to pay me more than ten people

822
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,080
What's wrong?

823
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:36,080
You're so stingy, you're going to pay more

824
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,080
I'll pay you more

825
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:41,080
I'll tell you, you can't afford to go out with someone

826
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,080
You're so stingy, you're going to pay more

827
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,080
I'll tell you, you can't afford to go out with someone

828
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,080
I'll pay you more

829
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,080
I'm not good at looking at things

830
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,080
But I can't afford to go out with someone

831
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:59,080
Don't go back, Xiaohai is waiting for me

832
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,080
What? You're going to pay me more than ten people?

833
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:09,080
I'll pay you more than ten people

834
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:12,080
I'll pay you more than ten people

835
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:16,080
I'll tell you, you can't afford to go out with someone

836
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,080
You're going to pay me more than ten people

837
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:24,080
You want to go out with someone or you'll be caught?

838
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:31,080
Muxian, you've been reading a lot

839
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,080
The sentence you're talking about is...

840
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,080
I'll pay you more than ten people

841
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,080
Come on, let's go

842
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:50,080
I'll pay you more than ten people

843
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:56,080
You're going to pay me more than ten people

844
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,080
I'll pay you more than ten people

845
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,080
Please

846
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:05,080
I've been reading a lot of books, but I don't know how to read

847
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,080
I'll tell you, he can't afford to go out with someone

848
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,080
He can't afford to go out with someone

849
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,080
I'll tell you, you can't afford to go out with someone

850
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:19,080
You'll pay me more than ten people

851
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,080
I'll pay you more than ten people

852
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,080
I didn't ask you to help me

853
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,080
Did you ever go through the same thing when you saved that bird?

854
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,080
So I want you to get rid of this kind of danger

855
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,080
You don't have to go through the same thing

856
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:59,080
Is that woman the one who signed the contract with the Parantho?

857
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,080
Yes

858
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:03,080
I heard that Gong Xi's mother wants to be with them

859
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,080
And Gong Xi is a good match

860
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,080
I'll pay you more than ten people

861
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,080
The End

862
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,080
You know, one minute and thirty-five seconds

863
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,080
Do you have time to think about it?

864
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:01,080
Sorry, can I start talking?

865
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:19,080
The End

866
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,080
Stop

867
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,080
Episode 1

868
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:47,080
You want to leave Taiwan soon, don't you?

869
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,080
If you don't want to talk, then go

870
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,080
You said that

871
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,080
I'll go first

872
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,080
What's wrong with you today?

873
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,080
You just got a heart attack

874
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,080
You didn't even think about it

875
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,080
You said you'd give him a chance yesterday

876
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,080
You forgot it today?

877
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,080
I know you two want to talk

878
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:14,080
So I bought you something to prepare

879
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,080
How much is the amount of the treatment?

880
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,080
I can give it to you

881
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,080
Why are you telling me that you have money?

882
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,080
I was also in the scene when I saved this bird

883
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,080
I'm not responsible for it

884
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,080
What responsibility?

885
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,080
You thought you saved him

886
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,080
Do you have the right to interfere with his everything?

887
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,080
You're doing well to him

888
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,080
How will he survive?

889
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:47,080
You think you can always be by his side?

890
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,080
Don't be good to him

891
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,080
Don't care about him anymore

892
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,080
He has his own life

893
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,080
You're now a colleague of the past

894
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,080
Not a helper

895
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,080
Only makes him more painful

896
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,080
Because you will never be his family

897
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:07,080
And he is still alone

898
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,080
What are you talking about?

899
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,080
I saw you clearly in the playground

900
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,080
But you suddenly disappeared

901
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,080
What happened to you?

902
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,080
I can go

903
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,080
What?

904
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,080
I don't know why I asked you today

905
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,080
I was embarrassed in front of everyone

906
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,080
You should have announced it

907
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,080
I didn't think you were so vulnerable

908
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,080
You don't need sympathy and protection

909
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,080
You're right

910
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,080
They are together

911
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,080
They are having a dinner at the Christmas Hall

912
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,080
A few days ago

913
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:17,080
Someone saw them taking a bath in the morning

914
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,080
Last time, the sun was the ball of the autumn

915
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,080
Do you still want to play the ball?

916
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,080
Come

917
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,080
Look at the chair

918
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,080
Gemi

919
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,080
Yes

920
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,080
How are you?

921
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,080
Come here

922
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,080
You take a bath

923
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,080
Take a bath

924
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:50,080
Anything wrong?

925
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,080
No

926
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:54,080
You said you were a little bit naughty

927
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,080
What are you doing?

928
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,080
What are you doing?

929
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,080
No

930
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,080
I thought you were a little bit naughty

931
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:05,080
Do you know that the big boss wants to eat a bowl?

932
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,080
You are so naughty

933
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:10,080
You should have told me

934
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,080
Acai wants to give me a body bath

935
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,080
He doesn't want to let me take a bath

936
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,080
You don't want to come to the car?

937
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,080
I think I'm going to be a mother

938
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,080
What do you mean?

939
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,080
What do you mean?

940
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,080
Mother can be his daughter at the age of mother

941
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,080
I tell you

942
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,080
You should have told me

943
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,080
I was the one who brought the mother

944
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,080
Acai treated me well

945
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,080
She even asked me to learn dancing

946
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:36,080
You are so naughty

947
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,080
She is so good at dancing

948
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,080
You know Acai is so smart

949
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,080
You should also learn dancing

950
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,080
She wants you to take a bath

951
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,080
Do you want to take a bath?

952
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,080
What's the matter?

953
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,080
She doesn't want to

954
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:53,080
She wants to make a big show

955
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,080
She wants to make a big show

956
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,080
She is so naughty

957
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,080
She is so naughty

958
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,080
I want to see you

959
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:04,080
I am not innocent

960
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,080
I want to see you

961
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,080
What's the matter?

962
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,080
The person went to see you

963
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:35,080
He said he was hurt

964
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,080
He is injured

965
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:38,080
Don't let him wait too long

966
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,080
Student!

967
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:03,080
Ren Guangxi

968
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,080
Ren Guangxi

969
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:07,080
You are so smart

970
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:10,080
You are wearing high heels for Ren Guangxi

971
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,080
You are so hard to catch

972
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,080
You are so smart

973
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:17,080
You are hiding here

974
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:20,080
It's not easy to do this

975
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:23,080
It looks like you are having fun

976
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,080
Ren Guangxi and I are nothing

977
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,080
Please don't say anything

978
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,080
Why do we bring you a sentence?

979
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,080
You should come here

980
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:35,080
You look like you are married

981
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:38,080
You lied to me

982
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,080
Why did you do that?

983
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,080
Don't be nervous

984
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:47,080
I just want to do my job

985
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:49,080
I want to see Ren Guangxi's last goal

986
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:52,080
Can you let him play the game again?

987
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,080
What are you doing?

988
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:56,080
Help!

989
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,080
I have a phone

990
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:04,080
The original one

991
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:07,080
Could it be that it was in the woman's house?

992
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:10,080
It's a woman you can't guess

993
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,080
Yes

994
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,080
Why did you come to the school?

995
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:18,080
Did you forget about Ren Guangxi's high heels?

996
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:25,080
Hey

997
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:27,080
What's up?

998
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:30,080
Where are you going?

999
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,080
Why haven't you brought the noodles?

1000
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:34,080
I don't know

1001
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:36,080
Ren is still there

1002
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,080
It's strange

1003
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:41,080
Why does he have to look for him?

1004
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:44,080
He was so handsome when he was little

1005
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,080
He became a fox now

1006
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,080
He just wants to bite and bite

1007
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,080
All the boys are coming

1008
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:53,080
What are you talking about?

1009
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,080
Nothing

1010
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:58,080
You should stop harassing our Mu Chen

1011
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:01,080
He is the classmate of this young man

1012
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:05,080
Who would want to know if you have any reason to be a student?

1013
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,080
I think he has been out for so long

1014
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:09,080
He must have been in a relationship with Ren Guangxi

1015
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:11,080
Shut up

1016
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,080
He is not a good guy

1017
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:16,080
He is not a good guy

1018
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,080
Don't make a sound

1019
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,080
I am sorry

1020
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:23,080
Don't block my voice

1021
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:25,080
I am sorry

1022
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:41,080
I love you

1023
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:43,080
I am so annoying

1024
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:46,080
Ren Guangxi

1025
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:50,080
Where is your beloved girl?

1026
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:54,080
Who are you?

1027
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,080
Apple

1028
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:58,080
Ren Guangxi

1029
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:03,080
It's okay

1030
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:06,080
I think you have forgotten your name from the beginning

1031
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,080
It's you

1032
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:11,080
I don't care where your girl is

1033
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:14,080
I just called her and forgot to give her my phone

1034
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:18,080
I don't believe you don't care about her

1035
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:22,080
It's okay if you don't come

1036
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:25,080
I think the man who is going to fall is a good guy

1037
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:29,080
He should be playing with his friends

1038
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:37,080
I am practicing the ice field

1039
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:39,080
Do you remember?

1040
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:43,080
You spent 11 hours to record my stable position

1041
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:47,080
There are many people here who want to see me

1042
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:17,080
Remember, you are alone

1043
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,080
Don't blame me

1044
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:22,080
Don't be so lonely

1045
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:25,080
I am sorry, my memory is really bad

1046
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:28,080
I am not interested in what you and your girl are talking about

1047
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,080
I only care about ice field

1048
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:33,080
So please don't forget to clean up

1049
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,080
You must practice

1050
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:48,080
Where are you going?

1051
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:51,080
Don't you want to see your beloved girl?

1052
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:02,080
Where is Ren Guangxi?

1053
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:04,080
I don't know

1054
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:07,080
He is so kind to call me

1055
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:18,080
He won't come

1056
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:21,080
He is not well-known

1057
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:24,080
It's okay, he won't come

1058
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:26,080
I am also very kind to you

1059
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,080
You should have just let him go

1060
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:30,080
Don't play such a boring game

1061
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,080
Ren Guangxi has nothing to do with me

1062
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:34,080
He won't come for me

1063
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:37,080
Ren Guangxi really won't come to save him

1064
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:39,080
How can this girl handle it?

1065
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:42,080
You spend so much time and you still find so many people to come

1066
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:45,080
You can't be sure if Ren Guangxi will come

1067
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:47,080
Isn't it ridiculous?

1068
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,080
I used to think Ren Guangxi is very handsome

1069
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:51,080
I didn't expect you to be so mean

1070
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:01,080
Ren Guangxi is very attractive to women

1071
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:06,080
It's okay, I will see if you can still be a good girl

1072
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:08,080
You will play piano

1073
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:14,080
Let's see if your hands and mouth are as good as yours

1074
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,080
Let me go

1075
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,080
Hello?

1076
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,080
Have you played yet?

1077
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:29,080
I will give you one last chance

1078
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:31,080
If you leave now, I can pretend that nothing will happen

1079
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:34,080
I gave you one last chance to recognize Ren Guangxi

1080
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:36,080
Guess what I am going to do now

1081
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:40,080
Didn't you throw your face in front of the school because of this girl?

1082
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,080
I will call her the big team now

1083
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:45,080
I will keep my face and her face and revenge for you

1084
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,080
Miss, you are so handsome

1085
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:51,080
Stop it

1086
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,080
I love her

1087
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:12,080
I fall into her eyes

1088
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:15,080
My heart hurts deeply

1089
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:18,080
But I won't forget

1090
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:20,080
We are...

1091
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,080
Stop it

1092
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:38,080
Why would you ignore me again?

1093
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,080
I didn't do anything wrong

1094
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:44,080
It's very sad

1095
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,080
Repруго

1096
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:56,080
I sent my phone number to our school

1097
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:57,080
Can't bear for this

1098
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:59,080
Wait

1099
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:01,080
After all, I have to do my best

1100
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,080
Then what am I going to do in this situation?

1101
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,080
What really do you want in life?

1102
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,480
This is fair.

1103
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,080
You won the competition of the University of Shenzhen.

1104
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:13,480
You've been playing for four years.

1105
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,280
I believe you won't go this time.

1106
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,280
As long as you can protect our Gongji,

1107
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:21,880
I'll let you go if I go in.

1108
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:26,680
But you can't take any risk.

1109
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,480
Don't you promise him.

1110
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:29,880
The speed of the final is going to be killed.

1111
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:33,480
Go and call the police.

1112
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:36,880
I'll take Mu Chen away after I finish the game.

1113
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,880
The gun is shot!

1114
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,680
The gun is shot!

1115
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,480
Are you OK?

1116
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:13,480
Your ball is as soft as your fist.

1117
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:37,280
One minute.

1118
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:40,880
Let me still be your enemy.

1119
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,680
I'll be your hero.

1120
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:47,880
I'll be your hero.

1121
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:54,680
Don't ask me.

1122
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:57,480
Just hold me.

1123
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:01,880
Don't love me.

1124
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:06,880
The University of Shenzhen and the University of Gina are fighting in the stadium.

1125
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:07,880
This kind of news is spread out.

1126
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,880
Everyone is trying to avoid it.

1127
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,880
At least they helped.

1128
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,880
I'll persuade you to help.

1129
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:15,880
Why should I help him?

1130
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,880
He's here to help you.

1131
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,880
Look, the arrow of the starlight.

1132
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:21,880
How about it?

1133
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:22,880
Let me play a card.

1134
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,880
I want to play with him.

1135
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,880
Please.

1136
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,880
Who are you?

1137
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,880
Are you from the football team?

1138
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,880
Who am I?

1139
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:38,880
What's important is...

1140
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,880
You're a loser today.

1141
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:41,880
What are you doing?

1142
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:42,880
What are you doing?

1143
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:43,880
What are you doing?

1144
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:44,880
I've called the police.

1145
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:45,880
Hurry up.

1146
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:46,880
We can't leave.

1147
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,880
Hurry up.

1148
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,880
If you say you'll give your hand to the opponent in the stadium,

1149
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:55,880
it means you'll give your life.

1150
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,880
I said I'll sign it.

1151
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,880
It means I'll protect you.

1152
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,880
I'll protect you.

1153
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:15,880
What are you doing?

1154
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:16,880
Go.

1155
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:17,880
You're going to get hurt.

1156
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:18,880
Go.

1157
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:19,880
Go.

1158
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:20,880
Shoot him.

1159
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:21,880
Shoot him.

1160
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:22,880
Go.

1161
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:28,880
I feel so bad.

1162
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,880
I'll give up whatever I want.

1163
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,880
I'll take care of you.

1164
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,880
Even if you're already a failure,

1165
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:35,880
you still have to go to the police.

1166
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:37,880
Don't know it tonight.

1167
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:38,880
Wait for me there.

1168
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:39,880
I know it.

1169
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,880
Help.

1170
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:42,880
Help.

1171
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,880
If you have the money, you can take off your clothes.

1172
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,880
If I don't do anything bad,

1173
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,880
I'll be a useless loser.

1174
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:49,880
Help.

1175
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:51,880
I'm not saying that you're a loser.

1176
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:52,880
Why did he have a Yuanjiao?

1177
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,880
I don't have Yuanjiao.

1178
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:55,880
I want to move out.

1179
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:56,880
I want to go to the Acai tree.

1180
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:57,880
You're not in the Acai tree.

1181
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:58,880
I'll kill you.

1182
01:11:58,880 --> 01:11:59,880
I'll kill you.

1183
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:00,880
You're stealing my man.

1184
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:01,880
I'll kill you.

1185
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:02,880
I'll kill you.

1186
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:03,880
I'll kill you.

1187
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:04,880
You have to get justice.

1188
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:05,880
Protect the people you protect.

1189
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:06,880
Not by the ring.

1190
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:07,880
You can do it.

1191
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:10,880
The investigation has confirmed that you're a loser.

1192
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:11,880
I want to take this lawsuit

1193
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:14,880
and let Ren Guangxi lose to a loser.

1194
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,880
If you encounter any danger in the future,

1195
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,880
you'll be called Ren Guangxi.

1196
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:19,880
Then you'll appear.

1197
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:20,880
Ren Guangxi.

1198
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,880
You were really on the committee that day.

1199
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:24,880
I think you should find a doctor

1200
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,880
to help you make a healthy diagnosis.

1201
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,880
I don't have enough time.

1202
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:29,880
I'll be in the court the day after tomorrow.

1203
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:30,880
I don't have enough time.

1204
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:31,880
I don't have enough evidence.

1205
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,880
I still have to find a way to deal with Xu Guanguo.

1206
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:35,880
Who is Liang Muchen?

1207
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:37,880
How can he let Guangxi be so serious?

1208
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:39,880
He's a student of the law and the law department.

1209
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:40,880
He's going to defend Mu Chen.

1210
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:41,880
He's not a loser.

1211
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:42,880
This investigation

1212
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,880
is a chance for me to prove Mu Chen's innocence.

1213
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,880
I'll do my best to find out.

1214
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:48,880
I'll never lose.

1215
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:56,880
I'm sorry.

1216
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:57,880
I'm sorry.

1217
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:58,880
I'm sorry.

1218
01:12:58,880 --> 01:12:59,880
I'm sorry.

1219
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:00,880
I'm sorry.

1220
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:01,880
I'm sorry.

1221
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:02,880
I'm sorry.

1222
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:03,880
I'm sorry.

1223
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:04,880
I'm sorry.

1224
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:05,880
I'm sorry.

1225
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:06,880
I'm sorry.

1226
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:07,880
I'm sorry.

1227
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:08,880
I'm sorry.

1228
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:09,880
I'm sorry.

1229
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:10,880
I'm sorry.

1230
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:11,880
I'm sorry.

1231
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:12,880
I'm sorry.

1232
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:13,880
I'm sorry.

1233
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:14,880
I'm sorry.

1234
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:15,880
I'm sorry.

1235
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:16,880
I'm sorry.

1236
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:17,880
I'm sorry.

1237
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:18,880
I'm sorry.

1238
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:19,880
I'm sorry.

1239
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:20,880
I'm sorry.

1240
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:21,880
I'm sorry.

1241
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:22,880
I'm sorry.

1242
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:23,880
I'm sorry.

1243
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:24,880
I'm sorry.

1244
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:25,880
I'm sorry.

1245
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:26,880
I'm sorry.

1246
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:27,880
I'm sorry.

1247
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:28,880
I'm sorry.

1248
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:29,880
I'm sorry.

1249
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:30,880
I'm sorry.

1250
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:31,880
I'm sorry.

1251
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:32,880
I'm sorry.

1252
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:33,880
I'm sorry.

1253
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:34,880
I'm sorry.

1254
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:35,880
I'm sorry.

1255
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:36,880
I'm sorry.

1256
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:37,880
I'm sorry.

1257
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:38,880
I'm sorry.

1258
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:39,880
I'm sorry.

1259
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:40,880
I'm sorry.

1260
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:41,880
I'm sorry.

1261
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:42,880

01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:44,880
I'm sorry.

1264
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:45,880
I'm sorry.

1265
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:46,880
I'm sorry.

1266
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:47,880
I'm sorry.

1267
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:48,880
I'm sorry.

1268
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:49,880
I'm sorry.

1269
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:50,880
I'm sorry.

1270
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:51,880
I'm sorry.

1271
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:52,880
I'm sorry.

1272
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:53,880

01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:56,880
I'm sorry.

1276
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:57,880
I'm sorry.

1277
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:58,880
I'm sorry.

1278
01:13:58,880 --> 01:13:59,880
I'm sorry.

1279
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:00,880

1289
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:10,880
I'm sorry.

1290
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:11,880
I'm sorry.

1291
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:12,880
I'm sorry.

1292
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:13,880
I'm sorry.

1293
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:14,880
I'm sorry.

1294
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:15,880
I'm sorry.

1295
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:16,880
I'm sorry.

1296
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:17,880
I'm sorry.

1297
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:18,880

1300
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:21,880
I'm sorry.
