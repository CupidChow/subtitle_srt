1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Next, I will broadcast for you the next time.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Please give me another chance. I will stay and help you to make a contribution.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's been a few days. Why are you so ready?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I don't know why Sunny Wei arranged me to stay here.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You think you are too young.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Then, I was able to get along with the whole family.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
A 5-year-old kid.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
He taught me to be honest.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So, I decided to find the real answer.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
No matter what the result is.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hurry up and ask the kid.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Why don't you let me go? Hurry up and ask the kid.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
If one day you find out that everyone knows about you,

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
then only you don't know.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Will you hate me?

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Will you not be willing to believe me?

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If you can prove that Zhang Zhen Ji has helped to help you to make fake reports,

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
then you can prove that you have been doing this all along.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Where are we going?

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
To the university of Shen.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Is this really related to the glass factory with Dad?

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I will support you as long as it's the right thing.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I will do whatever I say.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What are you still doing here?

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Go and chase them.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You just told me about the boy and the girl.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You must stop them.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I will go and find out.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This place...

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I never felt like this before.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Why do you feel so bad?

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I feel like I have been stuck with something.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I am so sorry.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I am sorry.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I feel bad.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I am sorry.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I am sorry.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I am so sorry.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I am sorry.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I am sorry.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I am sorry.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I am sorry.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I am sorry.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,900
Xiao Yu所以呢

45
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,940
Xiao Yu

46
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,460
Xiao Yu

47
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,200
Xiao Yu

48
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,580
I've always been in here.

49
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,960
How else would I've known

50
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,460
the key back then?

51
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,680
how how

52
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,820
how

53
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,460
how

54
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:44,800
how

55
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,180
how

56
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:45,900
how

57
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,240
how

58
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,900
how

59
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,520
Sorry, Master.

60
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,880
After Uploaded it,

61
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,620
I must worship Xiu Xuelu for me.

62
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,620
I've been here for almost three years.

63
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,620
I've been thinking about making it.

64
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,620
I'm going to the hospital every month to see the patient.

65
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,620
Six months?

66
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,620
You haven't come back here?

67
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,620
Should I come?

68
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,620
I only know that Sheng's mom has been gone for a long time.

69
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,620
But I don't know why my mom took care of him.

70
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,620
Why did she take care of him?

71
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,620
Maybe she has different feelings for this place.

72
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,620
When you were taking me in,

73
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,620
you seemed to be very familiar with this place.

74
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,620
You've been here before, right?

75
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,620
What kind of person am I?

76
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,620
What happened here in the past?

77
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,620
After you opened your eyes,

78
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,620
I often thought about it.

79
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,620
I don't know what happened to me.

80
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,620
I've been thinking about it.

81
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,620
I've been thinking about it.

82
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,620
I've been thinking about it.

83
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,620
I've been thinking about it.

84
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,620
I've been thinking about it.

85
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,620
What makes me happy?

86
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,620
What makes me sad?

87
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,620
I care about people.

88
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,620
I've forgotten them now.

89
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,620
Where are they now?

90
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,620
Those people I've forgotten,

91
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,620
are they doing well?

92
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,620
Do they know that I've forgotten them?

93
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,620
I have many questions in my heart.

94
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,620
But I can't remember the answer.

95
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,620
I can only remember.

96
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,620
I don't care about the show.

97
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,620
I don't care about the show.

98
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,620
Because I don't want people to worry about me.

99
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,620
I don't want people to worry about me.

100
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,620
I don't care about the three words.

101
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,620
They're only for me.

102
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,620
They used to be very unfamiliar.

103
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,620
My mom,

104
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,620
sometimes she would say that I did a favor when I was little.

105
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,620
She would laugh when she was little.

106
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,620
To me,

107
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,620
that was a little stranger.

108
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,620
But I can only laugh at her.

109
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,620
I told them that

110
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,620
I had a little impression.

111
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,620
We can talk more.

112
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,620
Maybe I'll remember.

113
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,620
I can only laugh at her.

114
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,620
But I really don't feel anything.

115
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,620
What is the feeling of forgetting everything?

116
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,620
I don't know.

117
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,620
It seems...

118
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,620
It seems that I'm living a strange life.

119
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,620
Let's go.

120
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,620
I'll take a quick break.

121
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,620
There are many people in this study that I was laughed at by the three of them.

122
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,620
That's a good idea.

123
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,620
You can leave the paper plate.

124
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,620
Before you were in the university,

125
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,620
the teacher of the music department

126
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,620
took his paper plate.

127
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,620
He took the paper plate.

128
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,620
The teacher of the music department

129
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,620
took his paper plate.

130
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,620
He took the paper plate.

131
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,620
One time,

132
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,620
he let go of the paper like this.

133
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,620
He fell down.

134
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,620
He would leave this paper plate.

135
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,620
I think

136
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,620
that father should love his son.

137
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,620
Just like I taught Xiao Le

138
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,620
to fall down

139
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,620
to let him be independent.

140
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,620
I think that father

141
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,620
should care about his son very much.

142
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,620
Am I right?

143
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,620
Why are you suddenly so obedient?

144
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,620
You'll leave after the interview.

145
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,620
Don't worry.

146
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,620
We'll collect things within three hours.

147
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,620
We'll leave.

148
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,620
I'm giving you the lowest loss.

149
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,620
You're my biggest enemy.

150
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,620
You'd better not play with me.

151
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,620
Okay.

152
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,620
Okay.

153
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,620
I'll leave.

154
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,620
I'll leave.

155
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,620
I'll leave.

156
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,620
Gui.

157
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,620
What should we do?

158
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,620
Is it effective to steal the time like this?

159
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,620
Will the lawyer really help us?

160
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,620
Enough.

161
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,620
I'm not patient anymore.

162
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,620
What's wrong?

163
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,620
We haven't finished yet.

164
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,620
Come out.

165
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,620
Give it to me.

166
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,620
Give it to me.

167
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,620
Give it to me.

168
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,620
Come out.

169
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,620
Give it to me.

170
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,620
I'm sorry.

171
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,620
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,620
Give it to me.

173
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,620
I'm sorry.

174
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,620
I'm sorry.

175
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,620
Give it to me.

176
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,620
I'm sorry.

177
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,620
Come out.

178
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,620
You're welcome to come here.

179
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,620
You don't want to be exposed.

180
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,620
You want to talk to me?

181
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,620
Or do you want to talk to the media?

182
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,620
Talk to me.

183
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,620
What do you mean?

184
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,620
I just want to know the truth.

185
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,620
You're my future son-in-law.

186
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,620
I'm not good at hiding anything from you.

187
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,620
These things are real.

188
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,620
Uncle, this is life.

189
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,620
You used to work as a rescue worker,

190
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,620
but now you're killing people.

191
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,620
You don't care about it.

192
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,620
These things can only be handled this way.

193
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,620
Do you think I'm going to harm those villagers?

194
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,620
When they found out that the wire broke,

195
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,620
they were already out of control.

196
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,620
I decided to stop the construction of the factory.

197
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,620
I didn't know how long it took to get out.

198
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,620
And no matter what kind of business it would be,

199
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,620
you should think about

200
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,620
how to make the workers of the factory

201
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,620
pay for their work.

202
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,620
I didn't want to see the pollution continue to rise.

203
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,620
So I decided to bury Huatinchun in the two alleys.

204
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,620
You can communicate with them.

205
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,620
Not with a bomb,

206
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,620
but with a sharp knife.

207
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,620
Communicate?

208
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,620
How many companies have you worked with?

209
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,620
Don't you know that if this kind of smell

210
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,620
was to be exposed,

211
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,620
what kind of consequences would it have?

212
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,620
I'm not done with this.

213
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,620
I still have to bear the consequences.

214
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,620
You'll see the consequences.

215
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,620
So you're trying to avoid responsibility

216
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,620
and not only lie to them, but also to me?

217
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,620
What's wrong with you?

218
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,620
You're now a lawyer,

219
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,620
and you're asking me, right?

220
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,620
I'm the father of the past.

221
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,620
This is a matter of two times.

222
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,620
You're supporting me.

223
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,620
I believe he doesn't want his beloved father to do illegal things.

224
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,620
He won't want me to do anything for Liang Xin.

225
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,620
Liang Xin?

226
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,620
Why do you have this?

227
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,620
You used to do things with love,

228
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,620
so you're now a lawyer.

229
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,620
You'll regret it anyway.

230
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,620
Isn't that great?

231
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,620
I'm very happy that I haven't changed

232
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,620
like before.

233
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,620
Because I think I'm doing well now.

234
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,620
I think I'm doing the right thing.

235
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,620
What's wrong with you?

236
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,620
What happened to you in the flower garden?

237
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,620
Do you know how you've changed?

238
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,620
I just learned from you

239
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,620
that

240
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,620
apart from money,

241
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,620
there are more important things in this world.

242
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,620
They let me know

243
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,620
that there's actually a temperature between people.

244
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,620
And it's not the relationship between you and me

245
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,620
and the cold-hearted.

246
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,620
I care about one person

247
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,620
and not want to get any benefits from him.

248
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,620
I just want to be with him.

249
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,620
Sometimes, as long as you're willing to give in,

250
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,620
they'll use their power to repay you.

251
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,620
Do you understand?

252
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,620
What about the monthly monthly salary?

253
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,620
Give them all the tools

254
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,620
that should be in the flower garden.

255
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,620
Xu Fang has done a lot of illegal means

256
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,620
to force the villagers to...

257
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,620
The evidence is here.

258
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,620
I'm asking you not to make any more mistakes.

259
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,620
What are you doing?

260
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,620
What are you doing?

261
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,620
What are you doing?

262
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,620
We're really afraid of you.

263
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,620
What are you doing?

264
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,620
Everyone,

265
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,620
the chairman of the board of directors

266
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,620
is in a relationship with the flower garden.

267
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,620
So we came to the flower garden to resolve it.

268
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,620
We've already agreed.

269
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,620
We'll inform the chairman of the flower garden

270
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,620
to the villagers.

271
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,620
Everyone,

272
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,620
this is a small misunderstanding.

273
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,620
It would have caused a lot of trouble

274
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,620
if we were to deal with it.

275
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,620
I, the chairman of the flower garden,

276
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,620
He Zhen Tang,

277
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,620
solemnly declare

278
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,620
that I will give you all the land of the flower garden

279
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,620
in the field of the flower garden.

280
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,620
You're right.

281
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,620
You're right.

282
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,620
You're right.

283
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,620
He Zhen Tang,

284
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,620
we've already signed the contract.

285
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,620
I'll make it clear that

286
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,620
the flower garden will never be polluted.

287
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,620
Next week,

288
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,620
only the experts will come.

289
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,620
We'll do the plan for the land to be redeemed.

290
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,620
At the same time,

291
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,620
every household in the flower garden

292
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,620
will be given the lowest

293
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,620
of 50,000 yuan

294
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,620
as a result of the evaluation.

295
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,620
The residents of the flower garden

296
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,620
no matter how old or young,

297
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,620
everyone

298
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,620
will be given a three-year

299
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,620
health checkup and medical supplement.

300
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,620
What?

301
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,620
I'm scared.

302
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,620
I'm scared.

303
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,620
I'm scared.

304
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,620
No matter if you're a physical or mental body,

305
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,620
you'll be responsible for all the doubts.

306
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,620
You're right.

307
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,620
You're right.

308
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,620
You're right.

309
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,620
You're right.

310
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,620
Chairman,

311
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,620
shut up.

312
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,620
I'll teach you how to deal with

313
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,620
the pollution caused by the waste.

314
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,620
You'll suppress them and make them move.

315
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,620
You'll also make them poison

316
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,620
and deceive them.

317
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,620
You're just doubting the public.

318
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,620
Don't worry.

319
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,620
People like him

320
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,620
won't leave the company.

321
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,620
That's right.

322
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,620
I'll leave him to you

323
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,620
as soon as I return to Taipei.

324
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,620
That's right.

325
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,620
Chairman.

326
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,620
Chairman.

327
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,620
I...

328
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,620
The evidence is missing.

329
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,620
What do you have to say?

330
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,620
Go back to the memorial.

331
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,620
That's all for today.

332
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,620
I've been waiting for you in Taipei.

333
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,620
No matter what you do,

334
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,620
you'll end up in this ridiculous house.

335
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,620
Tomorrow,

336
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,620
you'll be with me.

337
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,620
I'll explain it to you.

338
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,620
Chairman.

339
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,620
I'm sorry.

340
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,620
It's okay, sir.

341
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,620
Look at him.

342
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,620
Stop!

343
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,620
It's his!

344
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,620
Our visit to Taipei

345
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,620
will准 you back to your County.

346
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,620
Don't do that. Don't do that.

347
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,620
Don't do that.

348
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,620
I'm sorry.

349
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,620
I did well.

350
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,620
You did well.

351
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,620
Thank you so much.

352
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,620
But I'm sorry.

353
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,620
I must make you feel bad.

354
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,620
It's okay.

355
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,620
I'll apologize to her when I go back to Taipei.

356
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,620
She's very sorry.

357
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,620
She won't be angry for long.

358
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,620
You're right.

359
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,620
Go back.

360
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,620
Everyone.

361
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,620
We're really good at this.

362
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,620
We're so lucky.

363
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,620
We're so lucky.

364
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,620
We've successfully done it.

365
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,620
Let's go to the party.

366
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,620
Let's go to the party.

367
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,620
Come on.

368
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,620
Come on.

369
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,620
Come on.

370
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,620
Come on.

371
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,120
Hello, everyone.

372
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,120
Hello, everyone.

373
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,120
Hello, everyone.

374
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,120
Hello, everyone.

375
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,120
We are...

376
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,120

We are a national team.

387
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,620
We are a national team.

388
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,620
We are a national team.

389
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,620
Come on.

00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,620
These feelings

397
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,620
I feel.

398
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,620
But I don't want to drink.

399
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,120

We have a lot of people in our family.

402
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,120
If you don't drink, you won't be able to finish the game.

403
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,120
Really?

404
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,120
You are here.

405
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,120
You are so familiar.

406
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,120
Let's talk about...

407
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,120

410
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,120
Hello, everyone.

411
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,120
The first step.

415
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,620
Ladies and gentlemen,

416
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,620
you are the first step.

417
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,620
Let's talk about...

418
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,620

Let's talk about...

420
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,620
Actually, we don't need to do this.

421
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,620
You just have to say yes to me.

422
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,620
What?

423
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,620
Say yes to me.

424
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,620
Say yes to me.

425
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,620
Let me be a friend of Huatian Village forever.

426
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,120
I'm not a friend.

427
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,120
I'm a friend.

428
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,120
When you see me,

429
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,120
you should call me Mr. Ren.

430
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,120
Just call me Guangxi.

431
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,120
Guangxi.

432
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,120
Let's talk about...

433
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,120
Let's drink.

434
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,120
Let's drink.

435
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,120
Come on.

436
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,120

441
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,620
I'm not going to change you.

442
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,620
You're so cute.

443
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,620
You're so cute.

444
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,620

I'm going to take you to the doctor.

448

Thank you.

449
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,120

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,120
I'm sorry.

456
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,120
I've done a lot of shameless things.

457
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,120
Sorry.

458
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,120
Thank you.

459
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,120
Thank you.

460
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,120
Okay.

461
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,120
Ren.

462
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,620
I like you.

463
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,620

Many people think like this.

We want to thank you.

468
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,620
Thank you for coming to our home.

469
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,620
There's no time to go out.

470
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,620
There's no time to go out.

471
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,620
I'll let you know.

472
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,620

00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,620
You guys made me sing

481
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,620
I don't know

482
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,620
I'm a couple

483
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,620
I have a lot of hair

484
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,620

I like my wine better and better

489
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,620
It's good

490
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,620

491
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:03,620
I'm going to thank you for coming to our village

492
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,620

Thank you

494
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:12,620
Mr. Ren is a good cook

495
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:15,620
He's a good cook

So he's a good cook

500
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,620
I'm not a good cook

501
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:36,620
Mr. Ren, Mr. Ren

502
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,620
You've never seen him

503
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,620
He's so handsome

504
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:45,620
Mr. Ren is so lucky

505
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,620
So we must help him

506
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,620
We'll be back tomorrow

507
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,620
I'm going back to Taipei

508
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,620
But remember

509
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,620

Don't talk about it

514
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,620
You're all so funny

515
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,620
So it's your turn

516
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,620
You can go and change your clothes

517
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,620
Come

518
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,620
Why are you so quiet?

519
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,620

00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,620
I'll come back to you when I'm free

521
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:36,620
Why aren't you coming in?

I'll come in

523
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,620

I'll help you

529
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,620
I'll be back

530
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:35,620
You're busy today

531
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,620
Take him back

532
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,620
No need

533
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,620
I'm busy

534
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,620
Let's go together

535
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,620
Don't make me worry

536
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,620
I'm busy

537
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,620
You should go

538
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,620
I'll be back

539
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,620
Ren, you're dead

540
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,620
You're so thin

541
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,620
You're so comfortable

542
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,620
I'm so tired

543
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,620
I'm so tired

544
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:38,620
I'm going to go to the temple

545
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,620
OK

546
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,620
Come

547
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,620
I'm full

548
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,620
Thank you

549
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,620
Why don't you go and see them?

550
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,620
You're so fond of them

551
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,620
Why don't you go and see them?

552
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,620
You're so smart

553
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,620
You're not going to see them?

554
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,620
You said he came from abroad

555
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:16,620
Did he come alone when he came?

556
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,620
He's a man

557
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:23,620
No, he's a flower gardener

558
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,620
He's a flower gardener?

559
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:32,620
Yes, he's a good guy

560
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:36,620
He's a good guy

561
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:40,620
I'm telling you, he's a good guy

562
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,620
He's a good student

563
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,620
He's a good guy

564
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,620
He's a good student

565
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,620
You're familiar with this place

566
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:53,620
Yes, I used to come here to find him

567
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,620
He's a good guy

568
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,620
He's a good guy

569
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,620
He's a good guy

570
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,620
He's a good guy

571
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,620
I'm a good guy

572
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,620
So

573
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,620
Six years ago

574
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,620
You went to the college to study

575
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,620
Yes, I didn't go

576
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,620
What did you do?

577
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:19,620
I was just telling you

578
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,620
I didn't go to the temple

579
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,620
I went to the temple

580
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,620
But this guy

581
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,620
He's a good guy

582
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:31,620
He's a good guy

583
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,620
He's a good guy

584
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,620
He's a good guy

585
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,620
He's a good guy

586
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,620
Since the very beginning

587
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,620
I was thinking

588
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,620
When he went to school

589
00:30:48,620 --> 00:31:01,020
My children had him

590
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,780
Where they went all on their own

591
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,280
he asked my father why don't you tell him

592
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,240
he'll drink his sedentary shit

593
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,740
he's without this wet drink

594
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,180
ใ Logic

595
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,020
gla(?)

596
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,880
kicking a milk bottle

597
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,120
left a mark in me

598
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,520
I know

599
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,980
he never told me

600
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,920
that it was okay

601
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,520
look at him

602
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,800
he don't hold the letter

603
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,920
made us proud

604
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,920
I don't want him to be my father's wife.

605
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,920
I saw him in the movie,

606
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,920
he was so happy with you and Xiao Luying's father.

607
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,920
I saw him in the movie.

608
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,920
Now that's the case,

609
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,920
why did you break up?

610
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,920
I don't know.

611
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,920
I'm telling you,

612
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,920
I'm telling you,

613
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,920
Xiao Luying's father is a good son.

614
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,920
You two don't have to be so stubborn.

615
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,920
Xiao Luying, what's wrong?

616
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,920
I want to go back to the house first.

617
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,920
Why?

618
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,920
Don't you have to go with me?

619
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,920
I want to go back to the house.

620
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,920
I want to go back to the house.

621
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,920
Xiao Luying, what's wrong?

622
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,920
Why are you crying?

623
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,920
I want to go back to the house.

624
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,920
I don't know what to do.

625
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,920
Why do you like Uncle Ren Gongxi so much?

626
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,920
What's so special about him?

627
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,920
He has a father's taste.

628
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,920
Xiao Lu,

629
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,920
Uncle Ren Gongxi is going to marry someone else.

630
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,920
He will have his own child in the future.

631
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,920
But you still have me to pay for it.

632
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,920
I will ride a bike with you.

633
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,920
We will eat together.

634
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,920
We will go to school together.

635
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,920
We will be together forever.

636
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,920
Is that okay?

637
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,920
I know that no one wants to ask for money.

638
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,920
I want to make a wish.

639
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,920
I want to be the owner of the house.

640
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,920
I want to be the owner of the house.

641
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,920
We will be together forever.

642
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,920
I can't go back to the house.

643
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,920
I want to be the owner of the house.

644
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,920
I want to be the owner of the house.

645
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,920
I want to be the owner of the house.

646
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,920
Where's Xiao Lu?

647
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,920
I know you are leaving.

648
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,920
You are running away recently.

649
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,920
Really?

650
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,920
I thought he was more in love with Tuo.

651
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,920
I'm going back to Taipei. He'll forget me soon.

652
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,720
It's raining.

653
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,720
Let's go. Hurry up. I won't get wet.

654
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:57,920
What's wrong? Are we friends?

655
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,920
I'm going back to Taipei. He'll forget me soon.

656
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,920
Let's go. Hurry up. I won't get wet.

657
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,920
What's wrong? Are we friends?

658
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,920
I'm going back to Taipei. He'll forget me soon.

659
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,920
I'm going back to Taipei. He'll forget me soon.

660
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,920
I'm going back to Taipei. He'll forget me soon.

661
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,920
Thank you.

662
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,920
What's this?

663
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,920
I've planted so many trees in the garden.

664
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,920
It's called a pine tree. Every year, when the flowers are here,

665
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,920
I'll walk with Xiao Le.

666
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,920
I'll come back next time.

667
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,920
To see how she's growing.

668
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,920
You'll come back again?

669
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,920
Of course. I know so many good friends here.

670
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,920
And I'm so close to Xiao Le. I'll come back to see her.

671
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,920
I'll see if you don't want to take that fan.

672
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,920
Or your beef rice bowl. Only red radish and no beef.

673
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,920
I'll see you again.

674
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,920
What's wrong?

675
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,920
I've seen you before.

676
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,920
I've told you before. You were in the college.

677
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,920
Why did you lie to me? You went to the garden to see the flowers.

678
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,920
That's why you're so familiar with the college.

679
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,920
We met before.

680
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,920
You even know the sign of the college.

681
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,920
I'm the son of the college president. You won't know me.

682
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,920
Maybe we knew each other before.

683
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,920
I only work in the restaurant.

684
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,920
I'm not in a hurry to meet you. How can I know you?

685
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,920
Really?

686
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,920
Why did we meet for the first time?

687
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,920
I have a familiar face.

688
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:49,920
And you never seem to be familiar with my reaction.

689
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,920
When everyone wanted to be my secretary,

690
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,920
you were the only one who could keep up with me.

691
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,920
And you knew what bad things I would do.

692
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,920
In the end, you could convince me to help Chunming get back the land.

693
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,920
You know me better than anyone else.

694
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,920
Ever since I met you, I was afraid of myself.

695
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,920
I've changed.

696
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,920
How can I explain this to you?

697
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,920
After you lost your memory,

698
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,920
you were so unkind.

699
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,920
Did everyone know you?

700
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,920
No, only you.

701
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,920
I only treat you this way.

702
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,920
This kind of child has always been a vague shadow.

703
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,920
This shadow is very similar to you.

704
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,920
This person must be important to me.

705
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,920
But I can't remember how to think about it.

706
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,920
Ever since I was in court,

707
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,920
when I was with your son,

708
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,920
from the shanty, mysterious shop,

709
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,920
that girl's shadow has always been in my mind.

710
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,920
Maybe you know her.

711
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,920
If you know who she is, please forgive me.

712
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,920
I don't want to be like a fool in my life.

713
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,920
I'm just a blank memory.

714
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,920
If you were so important to her,

715
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,920
she would have come to you, right?

716
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,920
But she didn't show up.

717
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,920
She might not want you to remember her.

718
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,920
Do you understand?

719
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,920
You don't need to hold onto the past.

720
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,920
You have a fiancé.

721
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,920
You have to record the happy part in a few days.

722
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,920
Why do you have to suffer so much

723
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,920
for those memories?

724
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,920
It's not worth it.

725
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,920
It's not worth it.

726
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,920
Is that how you forget her?

727
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,920
Don't be afraid.

728
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,920
You once said,

729
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,920
if you meet again,

730
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,920
be like Mo Shiyun,

731
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,920
and break into the past,

732
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,920
there will be three simple words.

733
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,920
It's not worth it.

734
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,920
I...

735
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,920
Can you treat your life as an important person?

736
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,920
You don't exist as you used to be.

737
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,920
Is that fair to her?

738
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,920
You can do it.

739
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,920
But it doesn't mean I can do it.

740
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,920
Yes.

741
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,920
This is where I'm different from you.

742
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,920
I won't forget the past.

743
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,920
I will only be with the people I have with me.

744
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,920
They are the most important.

745
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,920
Listen.

746
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,920
Go back now.

747
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,920
Are you a flower-tongue?

748
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,920
Be careful.

749
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,920
I...

750
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,920
Liang Mu Chen.

751
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,920
I ask you again.

752
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,920
Please tell me in the city.

753
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,920
Do we know each other?

754
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,920
I will tell you this one last time.

755
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,920
We don't know each other.

756
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,920
Stop.

757
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,920
What are you doing?

758
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,920
Are you crazy?

759
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,920
What are you doing?

760
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,920
Stop.

761
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,920
I'm not crazy.

762
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,920
What are you doing?

763
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,920
What are you doing?

764
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,920
What are you doing?

765
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,920
Don't misunderstand.

766
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,920
If you keep walking like this,

767
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,920
you will only get worse.

768
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,920
Even if you are not the girl I want to be with,

769
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,920
we are still friends.

770
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,920
I will take you back.

771
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,920
Who is it?

772
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,920
You are Xiao Le, right?

773
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,920
The cookies I bought last time

774
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,920
were from my ex-husband.

775
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,920
I am from his family.

776
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,920
I will ask your wife.

777
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,920
I will ask her.

778
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,920
I will ask her.

779
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,920
I will ask her.

780
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,920
I will ask her.

781
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,920
I will ask her.

782
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,920
I will ask her.

783
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,920
I will ask her.

784
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,920
I will ask her.

785
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,920
Hello.

786
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,920
No.

787
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,920
Just like the rain just now,

788
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,920
this kind of uncomfortable moment

789
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,920
makes me uncomfortable.

790
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,920
The host is not back yet.

791
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,920
Please wait outside.

792
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,920
I will ask her to come in.

793
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,920
I will go.

794
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,920
Xiao Le.

795
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,920
Don't you forget Xiao Yang's story?

796
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,920
He can't let strangers come to his house

797
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,920
because he is a wild wolf.

798
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,920
Or his father is a wild wolf.

799
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,920
He will kill the villagers.

800
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,920
Xiao Le, you are right.

801
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,920
Don't let strangers come to your house.

802
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,920
If you don't know anyone,

803
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,920
you should observe them.

804
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,920
Maybe they will find out

805
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,920
he is not a wild wolf.

806
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,920
If they see each other for the first time,

807
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,920
they will be confused.

808
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,920
I will wait outside.

809
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,920
Do you have a cloth?

810
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,920
I will go.

811
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,920
Miss, you are welcome.

812
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,920
Don't come to my house in the next day.

813
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,920
Where is the toilet?

814
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,920
Come in.

815
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,920
I am curious.

816
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,920
Why did you let me

817
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,920
come in as a wild wolf?

818
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,920
I will ask myself

819
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,920
if there is anyone who can bring trouble to people.

820
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,920
It won't harm people.

821
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,920
You are different from your father.

822
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,920
You are not bad.

823
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,920
You are not bad either.

824
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,920
It's just that you know someone who is not right.

825
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,920
You are Xiao Le's wife.

826
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,920
She is my husband.

827
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,920
I and Mu Chen will take care of her.

828
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,920
She cares about you.

829
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,920
She is my most loyal husband.

830
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,920
Xiao Le, I am back.

831
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,920
I am back.

832
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,920
I am back.

833
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,920
I am back.

834
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,920
I am back.

835
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,920
Ren Guangxin.

836
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,920
What are you doing, Mu Chen?

837
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,920
Miss He, please don't do that.

838
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:03,920
You are my foot.

839
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,920
No need to put it down.

840
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,920
You need to find a doctor.

841
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,920
Guangxin, come in.

842
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,920
Come, come.

843
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,920
Thank you.

844
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,920
Don't worry.

845
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,920
There's something you can't do at home.

846
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,920
There's a pillow. Go get it.

847
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,920
Thank you.

848
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,920
Chen, will it hurt?

849
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,920
I can't help you.

850
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,920
It won't hurt.

851
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,920
Don't worry.

852
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,920
Why are you here?

853
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:42,920
We've been through a lot of trouble in Huatian Village.

854
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,920
I want to take you to apologize to dad tomorrow.

855
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:51,920
I want to see how you've changed the lives of the people in Huatian Village.

856
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,920
This is...

857
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:00,920
You're a very strong housewife, right?

858
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,920
Miss Liang, why did you call me?

859
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,920
Here, take it.

860
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,920
I saw on the table...

861
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:18,920
the cookies from the Ren's Kitchen.

862
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,920
They're the same.

863
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,920
I think you're the kind Miss He.

864
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,920
Brother Liang, are you done with your shower?

865
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,920
I'm not done with my shower.

866
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,920
I have to go to class tomorrow.

867
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,920
I'm not done yet.

868
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,920
Come, Xiaole, I'll wash your hands.

869
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,920
Yes.

870
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,920
Hello?

871
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,920
Hello, Zhixing?

872
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,920
What is it?

873
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,920
He's not drunk at the New York Nightclub.

874
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,920
What's wrong with him?

875
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,920
I thought you were looking at him.

876
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,920
He's shouting at the bridge.

877
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,920
You're wrong.

878
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,920
It's okay, you can go back.

879
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,920
I was a guest before, now I'm a married woman.

880
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,920
Don't worry, I won't trouble Miss Liang.

881
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,920
Her feet are covered in ice-cold water for 48 hours.

882
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,920
She'll be hot-tempered and will be gone soon.

883
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,920
I'll take care of Miss Liang tomorrow.

884
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,920
She probably doesn't know.

885
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,920
I'll go to class.

886
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,920
I'll be home soon.

887
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,720
8今宿

888
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,920
What are you doing?

889
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,920
I'm doing business.

890
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,920
確診說扇子做玩電燈,

891
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,920
they think you play ice-coldading.

892
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,920
I'm Marco is,

893
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:36,520
I'm almost into scratching the plane.

894
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:39,520
I hope you can help me get up early

895
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,520
What's your wish?

896
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:45,520
I hope you can stay here with me

897
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:49,520
I have a lot to tell him

898
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,520
I'll tell you when you get up

899
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,520
OK, no problem

900
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,520
I'm glad I just hugged you

901
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:07,520
Otherwise, you'll be severely hurt if you go home

902
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,520
I'm really grateful to him

903
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,520
But I'm afraid it'll cause you misunderstandings

904
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,520
I've known Guangxi for so long

905
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,520
I won't cause you misunderstandings

906
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:24,520
He's someone who needs help

907
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,520
He won't be blind

908
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:32,520
But he's a kind person

909
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,520
He'll become more self-conscious after you get up

910
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,520
So he'll help you

911
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,520
I'm actually quite surprised

912
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,520
But you're very special to him

913
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,520
You can change him in such a short time

914
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,520
No, he's not just like that

915
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,520
He's very passionate about each person in the village

916
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,520
He likes him too

917
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,520
He's not like what you said

918
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,520
He's a dreamy person

919
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,520
I'm actually quite surprised

920
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:09,520
In my eyes, no matter how successful Guangxi is

921
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,520
I still think he's like a man

922
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,520
He needs a lot of care

923
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,520
But I saw him taking a shower when he was young

924
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:24,520
I suddenly felt that he's a man

925
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:29,520
And he'll be a good father to that kind of man

926
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,520
Miss Liang has a baby

927
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,520
She must have loved him before

928
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,520
Can you understand my feelings?

929
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,520
I'm sorry

930
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,520
I'm not a kind person

931
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,520
And I don't really think about the past

932
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,520
I thought

933
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:59,520
Miss Liang is a person who values feelings and lives in the old

934
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,520
Sometimes

935
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,520
The present situation

936
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,520
Will force us to move forward

937
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,520
Some people

938
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,520
Have to give up on some things

939
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:17,520
This is what I learned after I became a mother

940
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,520
I can't stand it

941
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,520
I can't stand it

942
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,520
I can't stand it

943
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,520
Coo-Coo, you're so cute

944
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,520
Your feet will get better

945
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,520
Yeah, you have to thank Coo-Coo

946
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:39,520
Because her help can't be found

947
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,520
Coo-Coo is really like what Guangxi said

948
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,520
She's beautiful and smart

949
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,520
Why are you afraid of being told?

950
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,520
You're the most smart and pretty

951
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,520
Do you know each other?

952
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,520
I just found out that I've worked in the university before

953
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,520
Really?

954
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,520
What a coincidence

955
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:10,520
I've promised my uncle that I'll stay with you today

956
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,520
They have to go back soon

957
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,520
I asked them to do it

958
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:24,520
Can we stay here for the last night?

959
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,520
Of course

960
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:33,520
But I don't know if I'll be in trouble

961
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,520
No, this house is for the village head

962
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,520
He's also the village head who invited us to live here

963
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,520
You're all the benefactors of my garden

964
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:48,520
It's dangerous to drive out the rain

965
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,520
Please stay for a night

966
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,520
I'll leave tomorrow morning

967
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:57,520
Xiao Le, promise me that you won't be in trouble

968
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,520
Bu Kai Yi, you're my room

969
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,520
Okay

970
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,520
You're a good woman

971
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,520
It's really happy to see her

972
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:27,520
I feel so happy to see you

973
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,520
I don't know you

974
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:35,520
After you and Xiao Le met, you brought me a lot of surprises

975
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,520
Thank you

976
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,520
I'm sorry

977
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,520
I'm sorry

978
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,520
I'm sorry

979
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,520
I'm sorry

980
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,520
I'm sorry

981
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,520
I'm sorry

982
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,520
I'm sorry

983
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,520
I'm sorry

984
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,520
I'm sorry

985
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,520
I'm sorry

986
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,520
I'm sorry

987
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,520
I'm sorry

988
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,520
I'm sorry

989
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,520
I'm sorry

990
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,520
I'm sorry

991
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,520
I'm sorry

992
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,520
I'm sorry

993
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:24,520
I'm sorry

994
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,520
I'm sorry

995
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,520
I'm sorry

996
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,520
I'm sorry

997
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,520
I'm sorry

998
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,520
I'm sorry

999
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,520
I'm sorry

1000
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,520
I'm sorry

1001
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,520
I'm sorry

1002
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,520
I'm sorry

1003
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,520
I'm sorry

1004
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,520
Don't open

1005
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,520
The briefcase of the gift

1006
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:55,520
I'm looking forward to it

1007
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,520
I'm finally convinced

1008
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,520
Don't open

1009
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:06,520
The stage of the night

1010
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,520
Don't let the heart be in your arms

1011
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,520
Like a good girl

1012
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,520
It's your happiness and future

1013
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:19,520
I'm happy for you

1014
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,520
Don't ask me

1015
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,520
Just hold me

1016
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,520
Don't love me

1017
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,520
Be my lover

1018
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,520
Give me your hand

1019
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,520
One minute

1020
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,520
Be my closest love

1021
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,520
I'm happy for you

1022
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,520
I'm happy for you

1023
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,520
I'm happy for you

1024
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,520
I'm happy for you

1025
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:04,520
I'm happy for you

1026
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,520
I'm happy for you

1027
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,520
I'm happy for you

1028
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,520
I'm happy for you

1029
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,520
A印Can

1030
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:14,520
This dance

1031
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:18,520
Please

1032
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,520
For me

1033
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,520
My cozy

1034
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,520
Don't close

1035
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,520
It's reallyom

1036
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:38,420
Don't watch me

1037
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:45,000
I don't know who is holding your nose

1038
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:52,000
If I love you, I will turn around

1039
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:57,760
Maybe I'm afraid my dream will fly away

1040
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:06,280
Alright, it's not as good as you think

1041
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:12,280
We cannot fight no more

1042
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:18,700
But love also gets

1043
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:20,760
Z윤

1044
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,920
Who loves the答

1045
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:26,800
Theavi

1046
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,800
I'm not afraid of you.

1047
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,800
I'm afraid of you.

1048
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,800
I'm afraid of you.

1049
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,800
I'm afraid of you.

1050
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,800
I'm afraid of you.

1051
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,800
I'm afraid of you.

1052
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,800
I'm afraid of you.

1053
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,800
I'm afraid of you.

1054
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,800
I'm afraid of you.

1055
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,800
I'm afraid of you.

1056
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,800
I'm afraid of you.

1057
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,800
I'm afraid of you.

1058
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,800
I'm afraid of you.

1059
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,800
I'm afraid of you.

1060
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,800
I'm afraid of my dream.

1061
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,800
I'm afraid of my dream.

1062
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:06,800
I'm a smiley hero.

1063
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,800
I heard about the flower garden.

1064
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,800
I'm sorry.

1065
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,800
I'm here to invite you to attend our wedding.

1066
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,800
Maybe you should take a look at this first.

1067
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,800
Then decide whether to give me the wedding invitation.

1068
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,800
Maybe you should take a look at this first.

1069
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,800
Then decide whether to give me the wedding invitation.

1070
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,800
You said you heard about the flower garden.

1071
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,800
You said you heard about the flower garden.

1072
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,800
You said you heard about the flower garden.

1073
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,800
Did you hear about the starlight?

1074
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,800
Did he tell you

1075
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,800
that he met a six-year-old man

1076
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,800
who dumped his old lover there?

1077
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,800
He met a six-year-old man who dumped his old lover there?

1078
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:42,800
Where is Liang Mu Chen?

1079
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,800
Can't you remember?

1080
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,800
It's okay. I've already investigated for you.

1081
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,800
He is not only a secretary of the flower garden

1082
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,800
but also a resident of the flower garden.

1083
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,800
He is also a resident of the flower garden.

1084
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,800
He lives in the same room.

1085
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,800
The reason why the starlight has changed its attitude

1086
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,800
is that it's decided to be with the wedding invitation.

1087
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,800
It must have something to do with this woman.

1088
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,800
You can take a look at the information in this bag.

1089
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,800
He and the starlight have been together for so many days.

1090
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,800
I don't know if this woman

1091
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,800
has anything to do with the starlight

1092
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,800
or the relationship between the two of them.

1093
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,800
That's all because of the past.

1094
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,800
I don't remember anything about the starlight.

1095
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,800
When Liang Mu Chen left the starlight

1096
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,800
and the starlight,

1097
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,800
he appeared

1098
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,800
and didn't change anything between us.

1099
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,800
Where is the starlight?

1100
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,800
Really?

1101
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,800
The starlight is always with him during the flower garden.

1102
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,800
They have already fallen in love with each other.

1103
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,800
As far as I know, Liang Mu Chen is single now.

1104
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,800
He has a child.

1105
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,800
I don't know how you can still be so innocent

1106
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,800
and take the wedding invitation.

1107
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,800
I'm looking forward to the wedding.

1108
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,800
I believe that

1109
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,800
he won't do anything wrong to me.

1110
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,800
He won't do anything wrong to you.

1111
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,800
But you've done wrong to him.

1112
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,800
What if he thinks about what happened six years ago?

1113
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,800
The doctor said

1114
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,800
he might remember the past, right?

1115
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,800
When he thinks about it,

1116
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,800
he finds that he loves someone else.

1117
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,800
And in the past six years,

1118
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,800
he has been hiding all the past

1119
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,800
from all of us.

1120
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,800
Do you think that

1121
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,800
he will still understand you

1122
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,800
when he is in the same condition as Kuei Lei?

1123
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,800
Where is the power to lose the memory of the past?

1124
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:58,800
I don't remember the memory of the past.

1125
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:02,800
The past must start over.

1126
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,800
But don't worry about it.

1127
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,800
As long as we continue to be together,

1128
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,800
he will definitely restore the past relationship.

1129
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,800
Yes.

1130
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,800
Life starts over.

1131
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:22,800
You used to help Second Uncle and his mother.

1132
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,800
Of course.

1133
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,800
It's only about the past.

1134
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,800
I don't want the past to come back.

1135
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,800
Don't tell him about the past.

1136
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,800
I want to give him a new life,

1137
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,800
a new memory.

1138
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:41,800
Let the past, the unhappiness of the past,

1139
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,800
disappear completely.

1140
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,800
Let his life

1141
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,800
start over.

1142
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:50,800
But Auntie Fang,

1143
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,800
we are just lying to him.

1144
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,800
No.

1145
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,800
It's about protecting him.

1146
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,800
Can you tell him that

1147
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:01,800
he ran to the hospital for a girl

1148
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,800
but not for his own life?

1149
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:05,800
He was killed

1150
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,800
just to see him.

1151
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,800
And that girl,

1152
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,800
did she leave him on the street

1153
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,800
and ignore him at all?

1154
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,800
I don't want to.

1155
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:19,800
So,

1156
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,800
can you help Auntie Fang

1157
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,800
and this mother?

1158
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:41,800
The End

1159
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,800
Nan Mu Chen,

1160
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:53,800
should it be you who gave up on him?

1161
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:18,800
let's玩

1162
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,800
You...

1163
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:28,600
you'll易

1164
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:39,120
Good morning

1165
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:43,760
Good morning

1166
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,940
Why do you wake so early?

1167
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:47,600
It must be down在这Giangsthrough

1168
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,140
so you slept a sleep

1169
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:50,560
The degree of enrollment

1170
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,160
was not impressed

1171
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,200
Especially

1172
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,200
You are like this when you are young

1173
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,200
Lawyer Ren

1174
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:01,200
Why do you suddenly call me so deep?

1175
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:07,200
I think you should have been called Guangxi before

1176
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:28,200
I don't need to apologize to you because you are brave enough to face this

1177
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:31,200
That's why you are the most suitable person for Guangxi

1178
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:34,200
Guangxi, Hua Tu Yi, and Xiao Le's father

1179
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,200
Are they the men you taught me at the same time?

1180
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,200
How can you treat Guangxi like this?

1181
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:42,200
I'm with them right now. I will take care of them

1182
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:48,200
Take care of them. Please stay with Xiao Le

1183
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:53,200
I'm willing to stay with you, Uncle

1184
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:04,200
Yijie, did you find anything special about the special time in Hua Tian Village?

1185
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,200
Let Guangxi change

1186
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,200
Congratulations

1187
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,200
I will make a decision to marry you in advance

1188
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,200
Three years later

1189
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:16,200
Xiao Le

1190
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:18,200
Xiao Le!

1191
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,200
Did you see Xiao Le? Xiao Le is missing

1192
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,200
Xiao Le is missing

1193
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,200
He might have gone to find you in his place

1194
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,200
He hasn't been able to reach the destination yet

1195
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,200
If he doesn't come, he will trouble you

1196
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:31,200
Guangxi, I will go with you to find Xiao Le

1197
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,200
I will go by myself

1198
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,200
What's wrong with you, kid?

1199
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,200
Xiao Le, I don't want to go back

1200
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:40,200
It's okay. I know where you just came from

1201
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:41,200
I will take you there

1202
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:44,200
I think that grandma is like you just now

1203
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:46,200
So beautiful!

1204
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:49,200
Xiao Le! Xiao Le, what's wrong?

1205
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,200
Xiao Le! Xiao Le!

1206
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,200
I'm so happy to see you

1207
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:18,200

01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,200
I'm so happy to see you

1223
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,200
I'm so happy to see you

1224
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,200
I'm so happy to see you

1225
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,200
I'm so happy to see you

01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,200

I'm so happy to see you
