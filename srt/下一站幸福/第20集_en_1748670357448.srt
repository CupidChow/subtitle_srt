1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Next, I will broadcast for you.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,480
Next time, I will be happy.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,980
The me in front of you

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,180
is the most sincere one.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,480
Always.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,480
Duan, Lan Gao.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,200
What are you doing?

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,000
Put down your pants.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,240
You should be the one who is chasing him.

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,440
Mom, I will kill you.

11
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,440
I will kill you.

12
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,440
Why are you doing this?

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,440
You still want to lie to me?

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,280
Have you ever been in a fight with me?

15
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:42,880
Yes.

16
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,380
You lied to me?

17
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,380
If you really did,

18
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,380
you wouldn't have to hide your marriage from me for Hua Tuoye.

19
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,380
You should be the one who is fighting with me.

20
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,380
I am in trouble.

21
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,380
I even killed Fang Ge. I have to go to the police station.

22
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,880
Guangxi, I will explain this matter to you.

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,960
I will find him now.

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,960
You are looking for that flower?

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,960
I will play with you.

26
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,960
Don't forget that

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,960
you came here today

28
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,960
to tell us your choice.

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,960
I will tell you

30
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,960
because he cares about you a lot.

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,960
He is someone else.

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,960
Have you ever thought

33
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,960
that some people choose to lie and lie

34
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,960
because they love each other?

35
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,040
I don't want to hurt them.

36
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,040
People who lie

37
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,040
are actually more bitter than anyone.

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,040
I am against you.

39
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,040
This is a doubt that we can't deal with each other.

40
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,040
You have already accepted it.

41
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,040
I promise

42
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,040
I will not do anything stupid.

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,040
But you are the best.

44
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,040
The two of us

45
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,040
maybe we will meet again.

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,040
It's a mistake.

47
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,040
Dad, don't forget me.

48
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,120
I love you, mom.

49
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,120
I don't need a lawyer.

50
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,120
I promise you

51
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,120
because

52
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,120
I want to know the current situation.

53
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,120
He is being forced to be a lawyer.

54
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,120
I will go to see him.

55
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,120
I will ask him what happened that night.

56
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,120
Why did you go to ask him those questions?

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,120
I will tell you.

58
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,120
I will tell you.

59
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,120
I will tell you.

60
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,120
I will tell you.

61
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
I will tell you.

62
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,200
I will go to ask him those questions.

63
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,200
Don't you think he is miserable enough?

64
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,200
Don't bother him again.

65
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,200
I am just worried

66
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,200
that the charity was already caused by the flower branch.

67
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,200
I will go to ask him what happened.

68
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,280
Mom, think back to those experiences.

69
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,280
Do you think he is miserable enough?

70
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,280
Don't worry.

71
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,280
I have a share of the reason.

72
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,280
The most important thing is your relationship.

73
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,280
I don't need you to help me get married.

74
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,280
I can tell dad that you are a smart killer.

75
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,280
Or a miscarriage.

76
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,280
You need to tell me everything.

77
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,280
It's very simple.

78
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,280
I killed the person.

79
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,280
It has nothing to do with others.

80
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,280
I will tell you.

81
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,280
You don't need to explain.

82
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,280
You just have to admit your crime.

83
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,280
It has nothing to do with others.

84
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,280
You are so stupid.

85
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,280
I don't think it is simple.

86
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,280
I killed the flower branch.

87
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,280
I don't explain.

88
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,280
It's because the facts are like this.

89
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,280
I can't change anything.

90
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,280
Do you want me to kill Huang?

91
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,280
I killed the person.

92
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,280
This is a witness.

93
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,280
The one who will be more important.

94
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,280
Da Li.

95
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,280
You are right.

96
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,280
But I didn't expect you to be so serious.

97
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,280
The flower branch is not only a sign of the neck.

98
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,360
There are four faces behind his ears.

99
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,360
It seems that when you move,

100
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,360
you really want to kill him.

101
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,360
He is going to kill him.

102
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,360
Then he will be killed.

103
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,360
Go back.

104
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,360
He should have died.

105
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,440
She starts push.

106
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,240
If I could kill her,

107
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,200
I will sink into deep Liberia.

108
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,480
Ooh, it's not bad.

109
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,060
I can do it.

110
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,320
Higher in your rewards,

111
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,900
better in the rewards,

112
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,660
moreən mind pay.

113
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,920

I such a promise,

117
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
I have to save you

118
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,400
I don't want to see Xiao Le's heart

119
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,400
Because her debt

120
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Is a murderer

121
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,400
I don't want to see

122
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
The happy flower shadow every day

123
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
To worry about you

124
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
She fell down

125
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,400
What happened to my mom?

126
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
She worries about you

127
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,400
She heard this case

128
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,400
She is not good to you

129
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
She can't stand you

130
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,400
Don't make her worry

131
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,400
How is she now?

132
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,400
Don't worry

133
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Mo Chen is taking care of her

134
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
Thank you, Mo Chen

135
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Don't misunderstand

136
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
I am very simple

137
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
Thank you, Mo Chen

138
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
You don't have to explain

139
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,400
You care about Mo Chen

140
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,400
I know it very well

141
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,400
You misunderstood

142
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,400
I didn't

143
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
She said it herself

144
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,400
You care about her

145
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
If something happens to you

146
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
She won't care

147
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,400
She cares about you so much

148
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,400
How can you be so heartless?

149
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,400
If it's me

150
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,400
You can lose everything

151
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,400
You don't want to lose this kind of truth

152
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,400
So

153
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
Mo Tuoyuan

154
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,400
You want to worry about your mom

155
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Mo Chen's true heart

156
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,400
She wants to take care of her

157
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
She fell down

158
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
You want to help me so much

159
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
You want to help me so much

160
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,400
You want to help me change my mind

161
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
Is it really because of my mom?

162
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
Or because of Mo Chen?

163
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,400
I have said it

164
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
I am here to think

165
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,400
Is it true?

166
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
Anyway

167
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,400
I am confident to let you find out

168
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,400
The person who cares about you

169
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,400
As long as you nod

170
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,400
How do I cooperate with you?

171
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
Boss

172
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,400
Did you persuade Hua Tuoyuan to cooperate?

173
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,400
He agreed

174
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
But his attitude is very unusual

175
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,400
I deliberately said that Hua Tuoyuan was hurt behind Fan Erdu

176
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
He was still unconscious

177
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
But the problem is

178
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Hua Tuoyuan has no wound

179
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,400
That is to say, he lied

180
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,400
From the past cases

181
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,400
The police say that the protection is not for the sake of being punished

182
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,400
It's just to hide something

183
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,400
But Hua Tuoyuan didn't want to be punished

184
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,400
What is the real thing?

185
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,400
This is where we need to find out

186
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,400
There are only four people on the crime scene

187
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
Hua Tuoyuan doesn't want to tell the truth

188
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,400
Hua Fan Fan is seriously ill

189
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,400
Only the two witnesses of Hua Fan Fan

190
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
Yang Tianfu and Hua Zixing

191
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,400
But Yang Tianfu's work is very obvious

192
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
It's more strange

193
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,400
The reaction of Tuoyuan is that he doesn't want us to find Hua Zixing

194
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,400
I think the key to this matter

195
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,400
Is Hua Zixing

196
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400
So we need to review Hua Zixing again

197
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
That's right

198
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,400
We need to find the place where the trial is completed

199
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,400
And find any place where the problem is solved

200
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
I will play with Hua Zixing again

201
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
Don't forget

202
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
You need to keep the action of my police

203
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,400
So you can report to me

204
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,400
Boss

205
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,400
The police are currently investigating the evidence of the crime

206
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,400
The suspect is the local police officer, Tao Da Yi

207
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,400
This Tao Da Yi has done many big cases of the whole country

208
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,400
Even if he is not enough evidence

209
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,400
And the defendant is not fast enough

210
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,400
He will be charged with the crime

211
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,400
So he is in the legal system and has the name of the person who is the suspect

212
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
Tao Jie

213
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
The lawyer of Hua Tuoyuan has confirmed

214
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,400
That it's Ren Guangxi

215
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,400
I know him

216
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,400
This is where Hua Tuoyuan is the suspect

217
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
This is the official

218
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,400
He has the most shallow motive

219
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,400
If he had planned to kill himself at the beginning

220
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,400
Why did he lose the suspect

221
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
Besides

222
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,400
I'm asking you to investigate Hua Tuoyuan and Hua Fenfang's connection record

223
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,400
Is there any progress?

224
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,400
Yes

225
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,400
According to the local local Yang Tianfu

226
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Hua Fenfang and Hua Tuoyuan

227
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,400
They are not far from each other

228
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,400
There are two people who hurt each other

229
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,400
This proves that the evidence of Tao Jie's crime is not wrong

230
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,400
I think the conflict this time

231
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,400
Is a rumor

232
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,400
Although we found the weapon

233
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,400
But if there is no fingerprints of Hua Tuoyuan

234
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,400
This evidence also lacks evidence

235
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,400
Show me your hand-picked information

236
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,400
Last time I saw the crime scene

237
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,400
There is indeed a trace of the conflict

238
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,400
According to the statement of the defendant and the witness

239
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,400
I guess Ren Guangxi will seek the right defense

240
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,400
To cut the case for the defendant

241
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,400
But Yang Tianfu's testimony

242
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,400
Can prove that the defendant Hua Tuoyuan

243
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,400
His motive for murder is to seek revenge

244
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,400
This also allows me to make a claim

245
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,400
Hua Tuoyuan is also the suspect of the murder

246
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,400
But I believe

247
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,400
Ren Guangxi is not a good match

248
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,400
This time

249
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,400
I'd like to test the law in the text

250
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,400
To help the most criminal lawyer in the whole Gui Tuo

251
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,400
Ren Guangxi

252
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,400
Is it like the text

253
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,400
The police

254
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,400
The police

255
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,400
Come on, come on, come on

256
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,400
Come on

257
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,400
Grandma

258
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,400
Why are you running?

259
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,400
Are you here to see me?

260
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
I'm not running

261
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,400
I just...

262
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,400
Le, grandma is not running

263
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,400
I hope you can help her take the road

264
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,400
Take grandma to see our yard

265
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
President Fang

266
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,400
Welcome

267
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,400
I just brought the photo of the grassland

268
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,400
To let Xiaole to work

269
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,400
I also brought the milk soup

270
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,400
Xiaole can eat it without worries

271
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,400
Great, grandma

272
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,400
Come over

273
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,400
You have a big family

274
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
I'm sorry

275
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
So beautiful

276
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,400
The red thread is so big

277
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,400
Look, it's so big

278
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Grandma, where are you looking?

279
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,400
I'm looking at where you found it

280
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,400
It's so beautiful

281
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,400
Like you, so cute and gentle

282
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,400
Here

283
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
President Fang, the meal is ready

284
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,400
You can eat now

285
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,400
Grandma, I'm going to cook

286
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,400
Do you have any food left?

287
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,400
Come and wash your hands

288
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,400
Okay, I'm coming, be careful

289
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,400
Le, what's the 8th order of the food?

290
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,400
I want to eat it with the adults

291
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,400
I'll eat it with the adults

292
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,400
But I'm hungry

293
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,400
Le, listen to me

294
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,400
What your mom said is right

295
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Let's start

296
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,400
President Fang, please

297
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,400
Le, please

298
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,400
This is your favorite

299
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,400
She was happy

300
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,440
super

301
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,400
Isn't it necessary to cook

302
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,400
Look at this

303
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,980
The hair myths came up

304
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,400
Even though you're living here

305
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
It's tough

306
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,620
In our time

307
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,000
the living environment we live in became very weak

308
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,020
so I told you a million times

309
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,760
don't waste any coins

310
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,120
I understand You got used to it

311
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,640
And it's easy to work anymore

312
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,160
I am so sorry

313
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,560
Lผ suitable for aorf

314
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,520
I'm sorry

315
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:44,400
I told you before that you didn't have a family

316
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:55,400
But when I saw Xiaolei, I thought your parents must have given you a good family

317
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,400
That's why you were afraid of her finding you so sensible

318
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,400
Thank you

319
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:15,400
After I met Xiaolei, maybe it was because of Xiaolei's indifference

320
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:25,400
It was also because I was getting older and I was thinking about the past

321
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:34,400
When I was young, I didn't think Xiaolei was so happy

322
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,400
She was even a little bit ridiculous

323
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,400
She often got me pushed to class and didn't like me

324
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,400
Because my depression made her unhappy since she was young

325
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:02,400
But now I realize that I'm too late

326
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:21,400
If I were to be your mother, I would be too ashamed to be with you

327
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,400
We are all the same, we all love children

328
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,400
We are just different

329
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,400
No one is more caring than you

330
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,400
But I'm the youngest of the group

331
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,400
I'm afraid I'll be involved in your relationship

332
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:57,400
Let you, Guangxi, and even everything else be unhappy

333
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,400
But because of your decision, you can live on

334
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,400
That's the most important thing, right?

335
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:19,400
Because we've been through these things, I understand what you want to cherish

336
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:27,400
Even if I and Guangxi have never been through these things, we can't be together forever

337
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,400
No one can know what will happen in the next second

338
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,400
So the only thing that matters is to face the people we love the most

339
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,400
Please give me your best

340
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,400
I understand

341
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,400
Just like you said

342
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,400
I also hope that you won't give up this marriage

343
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,400
For the sake of the people you care about, please do your best

344
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,400
I don't want to give up

345
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,400
But Guangxi has sent me out

346
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,400
Just like the strangers

347
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,400
I really don't know how to approach him

348
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,400
It's really not a deal

349
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,400
Grandma, it's really not a deal

350
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,400
It's not a deal

351
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,400
Xiao Le, you should say it out loud

352
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,400
It's not a deal, it's simple

353
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,400
And I'm Le Xiao Le

354
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
Okay, Ren Xiao Le

355
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
You should be a cubit

356
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,400
Help your parents

357
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:12,400
And don't give up until you're done

358
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,400
I remember what I said happened

359
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
I've told you many times

360
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,400
I'm not the one who's going to say it

361
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,400
You're asking me, there's nothing different

362
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
That's right, you said it clearly

363
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
But I want to ask you one more time

364
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
Have you seen the flowering eyes

365
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
With the moment when the pig's neck was torn

366
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
I remember

367
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,400
I saw

368
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,400
There are many blood stains on the ground

369
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,400
And I took a bamboo stick

370
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,400
So, you're asking me, where's the bamboo stick

371
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,400
I'm asking you, where's the bamboo stick

372
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
I'm asking you, where's the bamboo stick

373
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,400
I'm asking you, where's the bamboo stick

374
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,400
So, you didn't see the flowering eyes

375
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
I...

376
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
I...

377
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,400
I...

378
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,400
I'm so stupid, why can't I remember

379
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,400
Calm down

380
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,400
If I remember, did you help me with the bamboo stick

381
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,400
Lawyer, I'm telling you, the bamboo stick is to save me

382
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,400
That's why I made such a big mistake

383
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,400
Calm down, I will

384
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,400
Where's my housekeeper

385
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,400
Where's my housekeeper

386
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,400
On your neck

387
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
Look

388
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,400
Many woodcutters have made mistakes after the horrible case

389
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,400
Or the situation at the critical moment

390
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,400
He is now very typical and normal

391
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
You can see that he has been touching his neck

392
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,400
The neck is on his neck

393
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,400
He keeps repeating the action

394
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
If my doubt is correct

395
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,400
There's another possibility

396
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
It's about to start, there's not much time left

397
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,400
Please contact me to take the major mental health course

398
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,400
Chen Yixing

399
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,400
Okay

400
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,400
What did you see in the street?

401
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,400
The blood on the ground

402
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,400
I'm sorry

403
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,400
I think your reasoning is right

404
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,400
In the test of the screw-up of the screw-up

405
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,400
The most important memory of the case is

406
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,400
the horrible experience of the crime

407
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,400
This shows that he is now in the most deep fear

408
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,400
He can't remember the most important memory of the crime

409
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,400
It's because he locked up the most unremitting memory

410
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
This is the new and new desire of the typical mental health

411
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,400
Doctor Chen

412
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,400
If he really lost his memory

413
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,400
He will not be able to remember the memory of his father

414
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,400
It's going to start tomorrow

415
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,400
Is there any way to make him remember it?

416
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,400
Tonight, I will monitor his sleep and brainwashing

417
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,400
And try all the treatment methods

418
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,400
Maybe I will have the hope

419
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,400
But I didn't guarantee him anything to you

420
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,400
His body's healing power is very important to him

421
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,400
I will help him recover his memory

422
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,400
I will try

423
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,400
The memory he locked up is the last key

424
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,400
I will only read one

425
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,400
If I guess it wrong

426
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,400
Maybe I'm already hiding something from him

427
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,400
Now I just need to implement this important map

428
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,400
Doctor Chen, please try your best to recover his memory

429
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,400
Please try your best to recover his memory

430
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,400
Hello, Sir

431
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,400
Your name is An Da

432
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Mr Ren, I'm looking forward to hearing from you

433
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,400
We all know that this lawsuit is quite unreasonable to the suspect

434
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,400
The probability of being arrested is really high

435
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,400
I'd like to see how the lawyer of Dinding University

436
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,400
Can turn this impossible into a possible one

437
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,400
There is only the truth in front of the law

438
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,400
Did Hua Tuo kill anyone?

439
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,400
Did he go to court?

440
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,400
When the judge hasn't been announced

441
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,400
My client is still a relative

442
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,400
Since it's like that

443
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,400
Then we'll stop the hearing

444
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,400
Doctor Chen, how is the situation?

445
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,400
Doctor Chen, how is the situation?

446
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,400
Thank you

447
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,400
Congratulations

448
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,400
The boss

449
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,400
I'll go and wait for you

450
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,400
Is there anything wrong?

451
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,400
The court is about to start

452
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,400
Are you worried that the judge will ask the questions later?

453
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,400
You look so tired

454
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,400
We haven't seen each other for a while

455
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
I think

456
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,400
Are you doing this for the lawsuit?

457
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,400
I'm not

458
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,400
I'm just worried that you might be able to get away with it

459
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,400
I'm just worried that you might be able to get away with it

460
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,400
I know this case is very complicated

461
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,400
You've prepared a lot

462
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,400
No matter what the result is

463
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,400
I'd like to thank you

464
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,400
Can you help Tuo be a big help?

465
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,400
You don't have to thank Tuo

466
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,400
Since I promised to help him

467
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400
I'll do my best

468
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,400
I don't want to see him be a judge

469
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,400
So that Xiaolei won't be happy

470
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,400
No matter how difficult this lawsuit is

471
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,400
I'll do my best to prove it to the best

472
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,400
After the lawsuit

473
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,400
You'll give me some time

474
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,400
I have something to tell you

475
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Let's see

476
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,400
Let's start the lawsuit first

477
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,400
Boss, the time is almost up

478
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
Let's go

479
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,400
Let's go

480
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,400
Xiaolei

481
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,400
Xiaolei

482
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,400
Xiaolei

483
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,400
Xiaolei

484
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,400
This court has reported that

485
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,400
Huatuoye killed Huasen Fang

486
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,400
This is the first time the court has been held

487
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,400
Please, the court has sent a quick request

488
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,400
Huatuoye was arrested on January 18

489
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,400
to avenge Huasen Fang

490
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,400
He was shot by a weapon and was shot by a police officer

491
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,400
It caused a serious injury to the victim

492
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,400
and caused the victim to be severely injured

493
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,400
Huatuoye's murder attempt is quite obvious

494
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,400
The court has reported the case of the 271 murder

495
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,400
to the defendant

496
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,400
Before the defendant was arrested

497
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,400
he was accused of being a fugitive

498
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,400
Please, the court has been careful

499
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,400
The court has sent a quick request

500
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,400
Huatuoye, do you agree?

501
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,400
I agree

502
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,400
What does the defendant mean to the lawsuit?

503
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,400
Although the defendant is the representative of the court

504
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,400
The court has sent a quick request

505
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,800
This is an opportunity to help people.

506
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,780
He has control over all people.

507
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,800
Meanwhile,

508
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,500
although I am a cook,

509
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,580
I am a veteran.

510
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,360
Therefore,

511
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,540
I demand that the trial be removed

512
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,360
and follows group 23

513
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,320
andceksin peculiarities.

514
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,480
S Youtube

515
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,060
please revive the first witness.

516
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:16,980
Liang Tianfu

517
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,740
you have stalled your'e recording

518
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,660
the exorcism in the Academy

519
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,780
is causing the tragedy of초允氏

520
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,940
around the student поз will come down.

521
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:27,940
Hua Fenfang also used the knife to stab Hua Tuoye's left hand

522
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:32,140
The reason for this is because Hua Fenfang absorbed Hua Tuoye's sister

523
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,340
and she was a new member of the Hua Chi group

524
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,340
Hua Tuoye was not angry

525
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,340
That's why she went up to seek revenge

526
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,340
Is that so?

527
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,340
Yes

528
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,340
But you said

529
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:46,340
At the time of the crime, someone was accused of being a flower soldier

530
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,840
and you were the one who led the police to open the door

531
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,340
Is that so?

532
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,840
Yes

533
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,440
Sir, from the testimony of the witness,

534
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,940
this case can be settled

535
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,540
The victim's murder was a crime

536
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,440
and it was a crime

537
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,440
And the help of the flower soldier

538
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,940
means Hua Tuoye had been prepared

539
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,040
before the murder

540
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,440
It's even more obvious that Hua Tuoye was the one who killed her

541
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,240
You're a victim

542
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,240
Nonsense

543
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:22,840
According to my testimony,

544
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,440
the case was settled with a million

545
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,440
to save Miss Hua Chi Xin

546
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,840
And you

547
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,840
also received a deep respect for her

548
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,440
Is that so?

549
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,640
Yes

550
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,640
Then do you want to find any weapon in her body?

551
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,440
No

552
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,240
According to my testimony,

553
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,640
after you kissed her for a million,

554
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,040
Hua Fenfang didn't let go

555
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,040
Even Hua Chi Xin,

556
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,840
threatened to rape her

557
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,240
Is that true?

558
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,740
We need to make it clear

559
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,040
Please give us a warning

560
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,840
It seems like that

561
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,040
Ting Shang, according to the witness,

562
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,640
my witness didn't bring any weapon

563
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,740
He just wanted to finish the transaction as soon as possible

564
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,740
and didn't do anything

565
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,140
The defendant's sister was threatened because of her life

566
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,840
and caused her to be hurt by the victim

567
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,040
without any choice

568
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,240
So the defendant's crime is a serious crime

569
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,840
Ting Shang,

570
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,540
the defendant had been sent to the crime scene

571
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,140
to negotiate with the victim

572
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,540
and was then stabbed by Hua Fenfang

573
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,740
At that time,

574
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,840
she had already known that the crime scene had a main stage

575
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,740
Even if she didn't bring any weapon,

576
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,240
she could still be killed by the main stage

577
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,540
And the defendant arranged for Hua Shenbin to take the little brother away

578
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,740
Ting Shang, this is the plan

579
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:06,240
Please call the lawyer to the third witness

580
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,940
Miss Yang, please explain

581
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,740
When Hua Tuoyue was arrested,

582
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,240
why did you go to the scene?

583
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,940
When the incident happened,

584
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,440
the patient was very panic

585
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,440
He called me the first time

586
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,540
and told me that

587
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,140
Tuoyue killed Fang Ge

588
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,540
and wanted to commit suicide

589
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,040
So at the first time,

590
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,740
I wanted to know the situation

591
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,240
and see if I could help him

592
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,540
So when you arrived at the scene,

593
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,940
Hua Tuoyue was already ready to commit suicide

594
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,940
I didn't want to let her commit suicide

595
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,540
I wanted to run away

596
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:44,340
Yes, she said she wanted to commit suicide

597
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,040
I took the phone call and rushed home

598
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,040
The car was about two hours away

599
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,440
If Tuoyue really wanted to run away,

600
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,440
she would have run far away

601
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,840
She wouldn't have stayed at my house

602
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,240
As far as I know,

603
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,340
Hua Tuoyue and you are not innocent

604
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,440
She was going to be arrested by the murderers

605
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,440
The ordinary people are hiding in a hurry

606
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,640
when they encounter such a thing

607
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,840
Why did you help her?

608
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,340
Because Hua Tuoyue helped me a lot

609
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:16,140
You can't repay me for the rest of my life

610
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:21,140
My son has a first-class diabetes

611
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:25,140
I raised him independently in the past six years

612
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:29,140
If not because Hua Tuoyue helped me in the deep of her heart

613
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,140
I would have been so helpless

614
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,140
I couldn't have come here

615
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:36,140
Although I didn't know what happened

616
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,640
I really don't know what happened

617
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,640
But Hua Tuoyue, who I know

618
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,640
is a very positive and kind person

619
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,640
who can't be a bad person

620
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,640
I really don't know what happened

621
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,640
But Hua Tuoyue, who I know

622
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,640
is a very positive and kind person

623
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,640
who can't be a bad person

624
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,140
It sounds like

625
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:24,640
Miss Liang has a very serious evaluation for the defendant

626
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,640
But I'd like to ask Miss Liang

627
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,640
Have you known the defendant for a long time?

628
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,640
I haven't

629
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,640
I haven't

630
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,640
I haven't

631
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,640
I haven't

632
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,640
I haven't

633
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,640
Have you known him for a long time?

634
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,640
I've known Tuoyue for seven years

635
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,640
When I first met him

636
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,640
it was because he refused to join the group

637
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,640
and escaped to the bookstore

638
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,640
It was also because of his personal identity

639
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,640
that he didn't want to have anything to do with the criminal

640
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,640
And because of that, he couldn't have killed anyone

641
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,640
If we look at it the same way

642
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,640
Miss Liang is not only a defendant

643
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,640
but also a defendant

644
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,640
As far as I know

645
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,640
She even talked about marriage

646
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,640
Miss Liang

647
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,640
Why did you divorce her later?

648
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,640
There are some reasons

649
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,640
I have to marry my son's father

650
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,640
That is

651
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,640
to let the lawyer know

652
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,640
So the defendant was your fiance

653
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,640
And the defendant is your husband now

654
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,640
Yes

655
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,640
Stop

656
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,640
Miss Liang would like to win the lawsuit

657
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,640
or to make a divorce for the defendant

658
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,640
Their relationship is a little special

659
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,640
So

660
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,640
Miss Liang's testimony is true

661
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,640
Please stop

662
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,640
According to the defendant's case

663
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,640
the witness is only a witness

664
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,640
and

665
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,640
the result of the murder

666
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,640
and the doctor's testimony

667
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,640
is to revenge the defendant

668
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,640
for the murder

669
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,640
and even the defendant's testimony

670
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,640
The evidence is only a warning

671
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,640
and the murderer is guilty

672
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,640
Please stop

673
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,640
The defendant is guilty

674
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,640
I don't want to hear you

675
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,640
I just thought that you should have forced me

676
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,640
I've tried my best

677
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,640
It's me

678
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,640
I want to go home

679
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:59,640
I want to go home

680
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,640
I just thought that you should not force me

681
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,640
You should not force me

682
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,640
It's me

683
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,640
Don't force me

684
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,640
I want to go home

685
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,640
I want to go home

686
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,640
It's okay

687
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,640
We don't have to talk

688
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,640
You're so pretty

689
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,640
You always wear it

690
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,640
I told you

691
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,640
This is the man who came to the garden

692
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,640
to buy me a flower field

693
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,640
He's so pretty

694
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,640
If it weren't for him

695
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,640
I wouldn't have been able to

696
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,640
lie down with you

697
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,640
Give me the flower field

698
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,640
No

699
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,640
No

700
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,640
No

701
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,640
No

702
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,640
No

703
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,640
No

704
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,640
No

705
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,640
Did you think of something?

706
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,640
I...

707
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,640
I don't know

708
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,640
I don't know

709
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,640
You must have thought of something

710
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,640
Or you wouldn't be so scared

711
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,640
Think about it

712
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,640
What did you see when Fang was killed?

713
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,640
I don't know

714
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,640
I don't believe it

715
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,640
I just saw Fang

716
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,640
I don't have many letters

717
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,640
I don't have many letters

718
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,640
I just want to go home

719
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,640
I don't want to go home

720
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,640
Don't force me

721
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,640
Don't force me

722
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,640
Don't

723
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,640
I don't want to go home

724
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,640
Don't you want to go home?

725
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,640
Don't force me

726
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,640
Fang

727
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,640
Fang

728
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,640
It's okay

729
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,640
Don't cry

730
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,640
It's okay

731
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,640
I'm sorry

732
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,640
I'm sorry

733
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,640
I'm sorry

734
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,640
I can't remember anything

735
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,640
I can't remember anything

736
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,640
Good girl

737
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,640
You're awake

738
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,640
Fang

739
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,640
Hua Tui

740
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,640
Your ten-second love

741
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,640
And your attitude to not cooperate

742
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,640
I don't want to change you at all

743
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,640
I want to talk to you

744
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,640
Do you want to talk to me?

745
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:52,840
I don't quickly

746
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,640
I want to get to meet

747
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,520
I want to get to know Wan

748
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,640
How can you think so?

749
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,640
Come. Come

750
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,280
Come

751
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,960
Stop

752
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,120
But don't move

753
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:11,960
Get settings

754
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,320
There is no problem

755
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,640
I'm just asking

756
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,640
Okay

757
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:19,640
So the four of you here

758
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:24,640
Hua Fenfang, Hua Tuoye, Hua Zhixin, Yang Tianfu

759
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,640
Everyone is a suspect

760
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,640
Your crime rate is only one quarter

761
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,640
There are so many places that are good for you

762
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,640
But you have to admit your crime

763
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,640
I really don't understand you

764
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,640
Didn't you ask around?

765
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,640
This Taobao's case is so clear

766
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,640
If you don't take your crime seriously,

767
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,640
he will be in your hands

768
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,640
Can you bear to take it?

769
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,640
What's wrong with you?

770
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,640
I'm a high-ranking lawyer. Please tell me the point

771
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,640
Stop it. I don't know why I took my crime

772
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:13,640
But I can also guess that

773
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:18,640
Hua Fenfang suddenly found out that he wanted to commit suicide

774
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:23,640
Or that Xiaodi was a murderer

775
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,640
She wanted to be the boss

776
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:32,640
Or Hua Zhixin was the one who was shocked

777
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,640
That's why she killed Hua Fenfang

778
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,640
What nonsense are you talking about?

779
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,640
I killed her

780
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,640
What are you doing?

781
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,640
She has nothing to do with this

782
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,640
That's strange. Why didn't you tell me that

783
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:51,640
it has nothing to do with Fang Ge and Xiaodi?

784
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,640
You lied to me that it has nothing to do with Hua Zhixin

785
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,640
That's why you found out that Hua Zhixin lost the most important memory

786
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,640
So you hid the truth and confessed your crime

787
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,640
There is only one possibility

788
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,640
It's to protect Hua Zhixin

789
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,640
Lawyer!

790
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,640
She didn't do anything wrong

791
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,640
I killed her

792
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,640
Fang Yi, the criminal is a criminal

793
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,640
Please tell the lawyer to control the situation

794
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,640
Police, there is a further discussion

795
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,640
I can boldly say that the real murderer is Hua Zhixin

796
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,640
Actually, the defendant is Qing Baidang

797
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:34,640
Don't be so rash

798
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,640
Lawyer, my lawyer is lying

799
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,640
I don't need him to defend me

800
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,640
I've already confessed my crime

801
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,640
Why don't you arrest me and go to jail?

802
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,640
You're still a man

803
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,640
Lawyer Ruo is right

804
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:53,640
Hua Fenfang is the one who killed her

805
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,640
You're the one who killed Hua

806
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,640
I've already confessed my crime

807
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,040
I can't believe that I killed Hua

808
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,640
Your lawyer is a criminal

809
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,640
I don't need him to defend me

810
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,640
I've already confessed my crime

811
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,640
Why don't you arrest me and go to jail?

812
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,640
You're still a man

813
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,640
No

814
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,640
You're a criminal

815
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,640
Let's go

816
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:26,640
Ok

817
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:28,640
You're a criminal

818
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,640
What?

819
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,640
The lawyer said it was true.

820
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,640
I killed Hua Fenfang.

821
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,640
Shut up!

822
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,640
I didn't say anything.

823
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,640
Who told you to come here?

824
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,640
I don't need you to help me.

825
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,640
I'm going back.

826
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,640
What are you doing here?

827
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,640
Brother Tui.

828
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,640
Don't lie to me.

829
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,640
You shouldn't have done this to me.

830
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,640
Stop.

831
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,640
This is the witness of my transfer, Miss Hua.

832
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,660
The witness is Tee Da, the

833
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,660
witness of my transfer, Chen Yishi.

834
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:33,660
Hua Xixin is my patient.

835
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:35,660
I've already done all the treatment

836
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,660
to help her recover all the memories of the crime.

837
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:39,660
I can guarantee that Hua Xixin's

838
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:42,660
all the evidences on the court are absolutely effective.

839
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:45,660
Miss Ren,

840
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,660
I doubted the memory of the crime I lost

841
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:49,660
when I was a child.

842
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:52,660
I can't think of anything else.

843
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,660
It's the most important thing.

844
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:58,660
So, please, Chen Yishi,

845
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:00,660
help me recover.

846
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:03,660
Until just now,

847
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:08,660
I thought of all the past.

848
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:24,660
That's right.

849
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:27,660
I killed Brother Fang.

850
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:30,660
At that time,

851
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:32,660
I saw Brother Fang

852
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:35,660
almost got killed by Brother Tui.

853
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:37,660
He was...

854
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:40,660
He was Brother Tui.

855
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:43,660
He was hurt by Brother Fang before.

856
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:54,660
Brother Tui.

857
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:00,660
Brother Tui.

858
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,660
Who did you kill?

859
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:04,660
Chen Yishi.

860
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:05,660
Brother Tui.

861
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:06,660
Let's go.

862
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:11,660
Let's go.

863
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:13,660
It's me.

864
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:17,660
I took another brother Tui

865
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,660
and killed Brother Fang.

866
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:24,660
I was...

867
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:27,660
I was scared

868
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:30,660
that Brother Fang would hurt Brother Tui.

869
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:33,660
Then,

870
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:36,660
I saw

871
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:38,660
another brother Tui next to me.

872
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:41,660
I didn't think about it.

873
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,660
I took the brother Tui

874
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,660
and killed Brother Fang.

875
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:51,660
I was scared.

876
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,680
I was scared.

877
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,680
When I recovered,

878
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,680
Brother Fang was already on the ground.

879
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,680
So, at that time,

880
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,680
I thought

881
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,680
that Brother Tui was killed.

882
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:12,700
I was afraid

883
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:15,700
that I would hurt you.

884
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,700
I thought

885
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:20,700
that Brother Tui

886
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:22,700
could recover

887
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,700
and kill Brother Tui

888
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:27,700
because of me.

889
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:29,700
I thought that Brother Tui

890
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:31,700
could recover

891
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:33,700
and kill Brother Tui

892
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:35,700
because of me.

893
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:36,700
So, I said

894
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,700
that you should return him to his family.

895
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:41,700
Because of this,

896
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,700
there will be a miracle.

897
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:46,700
This is the mental report

898
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,700
that I made to Hua Shixin.

899
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:50,700
During the period when Hua Shixin

900
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,700
was imprisoned by the Flower Fist,

901
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,700
she was often controlled by monsters

902
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:55,700
and the violent abuse.

903
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,700
So, she created PTSD,

904
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:58,700
which is the so-called

905
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,700
creating and pressure-resistant group.

906
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,700
Fortunately, the lawyer observed it

907
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,700
so that he found the patient's true form.

908
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,700
Some patients

909
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,700
will have a deep desire

910
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,700
for their own memories.

911
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,720
Hua Shixin is such a case.

912
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:13,720
When I was testing the case,

913
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,720
Hua Shixin was not a murderer.

914
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,720
It was PTSD,

915
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:18,720
which added

916
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,720
the effect of the drug.

917
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,720
She was controlled by the time she lost her mind

918
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:22,720
to kill Hua Shixin.

919
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,720
I didn't mean to kill her.

920
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:33,720
I'm sorry, Brother Tui.

921
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,720
I didn't mean to take her out.

922
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:43,720
She said that I wasn't caught by Brother Fang.

923
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,720
It wouldn't have happened so many times.

924
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,720
It was all my fault.

925
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,720
I'm sorry.

926
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:53,720
I'm sorry.

927
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:04,720
Hua Shixin.

928
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,720
How could you make her remember?

929
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,720
When you were in her arms,

930
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:12,720
if you could forget

931
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,720
those horrible encounters,

932
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,720
you would be happy.

933
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,720
Hua Shixin had to take revenge

934
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,720
to hurt her.

935
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:28,720
It was a new victim.

936
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,720
Why did you judge her?

937
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,720
You were a bad person.

938
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,720
But you were wrong.

939
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:46,720
You shouldn't have thought

940
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,720
you could do everything.

941
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,720
You shouldn't have thought

942
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,720
you would be fine

943
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,720
if you were guilty.

944
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:52,720
If you were wrong,

945
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:53,720
you would be happy.

946
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:54,720
You would be happy.

947
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,720
You should have apologized at the beginning.

948
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,720
How could I know that?

949
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:01,720
Brother Tui.

950
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,720
The lawyer is right.

951
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,720
You were wrong.

952
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:08,740
You should have apologized.

953
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:11,740
Do you know

954
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:13,740
when I saw you

955
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:17,740
I was so upset.

956
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:19,740
I was so guilty.

957
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:28,740
I didn't have you by my side.

958
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:31,740
I was so unhappy.

959
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:38,740
I was so upset.

960
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:47,740
Please explain

961
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:48,740
what you think

962
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:51,740
about the person who was guilty.

963
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:01,740
Mr. Ting.

964
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:02,740
This time,

965
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:03,740
we thought

966
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:05,740
Hua Tuoye was guilty.

967
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,760
We decided to take her back.

968
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,760
Before Hua Tui Xin was murdered,

969
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,760
we thought there was a need for further investigation.

970
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,760
Please stop the arrest of Hua Tui Xin.

971
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,760
Mr. Ting.

972
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,760
According to Hua Tui Xin's mental condition,

973
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,760
the crime is indeed a proper defense.

974
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,760
Now she is guilty at court.

975
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:26,760
Please stop

976
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,760
and ask the prosecutor

977
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:29,760
to consider her more

978
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,760
and to review her.

979
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:32,760
We also hope the prosecutor

980
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:33,760
can investigate

981
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:35,780
the crime of the criminal organization.

982
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:44,780
The prosecutor

983
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:46,780
is now back to Hua Tuoye.

984
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:48,780
Hua Tui Xin was murdered

985
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:49,780
and the prosecutor

986
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:51,780
set up a defense to protect the freedom,

987
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:52,780
to protect the public,

988
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:54,780
and to punish the crime of gun crime.

989
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:55,780
Please find the prosecutor

990
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:57,780
to verify the crime.

991
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,780
Ms. Tui Xin!

992
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:07,280
Ms. Tui Xin!

993
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,780
Stop.

994
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:10,780
I'm scared.

995
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:14,780
Mr. Tuoye won't leave you.

996
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:16,780
Talk.

997
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,780
Wait for you to come back

998
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:19,780
and help me

999
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:21,780
put the stick on its head.

1000
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:28,780
Mr. Tuoye,

1001
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:30,780
don't worry about me.

1002
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:33,780
Don't worry about me.

1003
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:38,780
When I come back, I will grow up a little.

1004
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:41,780
I will be a little bit more.

1005
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:44,780
I won't let you worry about my sister.

1006
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:48,780
Remember.

1007
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:52,780
You have to come back to me.

1008
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:57,780
I will wait for you at home with A'Bu.

1009
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:24,960
I will

1010
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:36,780
I love him, don't pretend to be desperate

1011
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:42,780
My heart is deeply hurt, but I won't forget

1012
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,780
We are not

1013
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:52,780
Boss, I'll take the manga to the office to help you get back to the city

1014
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:54,780
I'll be back with you later

1015
00:59:55,780 --> 01:00:02,780
Mr. Chen, your performance today has made me completely change my impression of you

1016
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:08,780
What I admire the most is that you can see the PTSD symptoms that most people can't see

1017
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:13,780
This is not only to make the case go away, but also to make the truth come true

1018
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:16,780
Otherwise, the consequences will be unimaginable

1019
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,780
Thank you

1020
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:23,780
But how did you do it?

1021
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:29,780
Actually, it's very simple

1022
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:32,780
I once had PTSD

1023
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:35,780
I can't tell

1024
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:39,780
I heard that you are very patient with such people

1025
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:46,780
By the way, I heard from the lawyer that you will participate in the judicial committee held in the US

1026
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:49,780
We'll have a good time then

1027
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:53,780
I hope that there will be more opportunities for you to be a teacher

1028
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:55,780
I'm looking forward to it

1029
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:09,780
Although the judge believes that you won't be a thief, he has to let you go home now

1030
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:14,780
But don't worry, because you are still a senior in the police department

1031
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:17,780
You can be guilty, you should be able to do it

1032
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:20,780
I will try to help you get back to your previous position

1033
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:25,780
It doesn't matter

1034
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:30,780
Please, just try to help Chixin

1035
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:36,780
No matter who you are or Chixin, I will let you go home as soon as possible

1036
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:39,780
Don't worry

1037
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:55,780
I'm sorry

1038
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:58,780
I want to thank you

1039
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:02,780
Although I knew that you were taking care of them

1040
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:09,780
But I know that what you did today is more than I thought

1041
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:14,780
You don't owe me anything

1042
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:17,780
So what?

1043
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:22,780
Six years ago, I was in the school's evidence investigation room and saved Mu Chen

1044
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:25,780
Now he's helping me again

1045
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:31,780
It's obvious that you have the ability to take care of them

1046
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:39,780
This proves that I'm a good lawyer

1047
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:44,780
What's the other?

1048
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:48,780
What does that mean?

1049
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:56,780
I mean, as a lawyer, I've already sent you back to Mu Chen and Xiao Le

1050
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:59,780
My responsibility is over

1051
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:03,780
So I hope you can continue to take the responsibility for your six years

1052
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,780
Take good care of them

1053
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:11,780
I'm not sure, you want me to take care of your son and your wife

1054
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:14,780
What do you want?

1055
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:20,780
I'll tell you clearly

1056
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:25,780
I kept him in my life because I thought we could change something

1057
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:29,780
But in the end, it was a mutual wound

1058
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:33,780
Six years ago, Mu Chen was right

1059
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:37,780
I'm not the one who can make him depend on the people he's giving to him

1060
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:41,780
You are

1061
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:47,780
Lawyer Ren, you still don't know why he left you, right?

1062
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:13,780
Com

1063
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:19,780
What do you mean?

1064
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:28,780
Have you ever thought that if he chose me, why would he not accept me in the past six years?

1065
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:33,780
Why would he tell Xiao Le that he has a father?

1066
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:37,780
He would call him Mr. Mishu

1067
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:40,780
Who is that Mr. Mishu?

1068
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:45,780
You are a lawyer

1069
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:49,780
You are so smart, why do you think of such a simple answer?

1070
01:04:52,780 --> 01:05:00,780
The answer is that the stupid woman Yang Mu Chen has always been a man

1071
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:04,780
You are the one who is Ren Guangxi

1072
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:10,780
That's why he lied to you six years ago

1073
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:15,780
You are lying to me

1074
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:20,780
Do you really think Mu Chen is such a realistic woman?

1075
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:25,780
Six years ago, if your mother didn't ask him to leave you

1076
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:30,780
Mu Chen wanted you to accept the contract of the contract to save you

1077
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:32,780
He would find me to lie to you

1078
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:39,780
Six years ago, he knew you were alive

1079
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:41,780
He couldn't go to you

1080
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:45,780
He just didn't want to break your relationship with Mu

1081
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:50,780
But now he has to accept all your wrongs

1082
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:53,780
How much he believes you

1083
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,780
Do you know that?

1084
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:03,780
Yes

1085
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:07,780
He is very smart

1086
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:13,780
He didn't ask me anything, so he decided to leave me alone

1087
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:17,780
He thinks I would be happy if I live like this

1088
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:22,780
Yes, he is very smart, he didn't ask you

1089
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:24,780
But you are alive

1090
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:26,780
Isn't that more important than anything?

1091
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:32,780
I believe if you were to exchange your role with him

1092
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:36,780
You would make the same decision for the person you love

1093
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:41,780
Unless you don't love Mu Chen

1094
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:50,780
But that was in the past

1095
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:53,780
I also proposed to him

1096
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:56,780
And he accepted this

1097
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:58,780
This is what I saw

1098
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:02,780
He will never accept his final decision

1099
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:08,780
What?

1100
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:11,780
I should forget this name

1101
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:25,780
So, you are done?

1102
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:30,780
I am done

1103
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:36,780
I am done

1104
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:41,780
I am done, I am done

1105
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:43,780
I can't go to the hospital

1106
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:44,780
I am done

1107
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:48,780
The lawyer and the lawyer are all done

1108
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:50,780
I am done, I am done

1109
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:51,780
I am done, I am done

1110
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:53,780
I am sorry

1111
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:55,780
The judge will consider the situation of the new law

1112
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,780
And he will do something bad to her

1113
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:00,780
I can guarantee that the new law will not be too heavy

1114
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:04,780
It's not like that, they are all your fault

1115
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,780
You are responsible for your own fault

1116
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:08,780
I want you to be punished

1117
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:11,780
Otherwise, you will be punished

1118
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:14,780
If you don't want to be punished, you can just leave the house

1119
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:16,780
And you can't be a lawyer

1120
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:17,780
No

1121
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:22,780
I am sorry, there are many procedures to be done

1122
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:24,780
So I don't need to leave

1123
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:27,780
Yes, I am sorry, you are a very important person

1124
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:29,780
Don't worry, you don't know

1125
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:31,780
You can be a lawyer and be a civil servant

1126
01:08:31,780 --> 01:08:33,780
I am very grateful to you

1127
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:35,780
Let's go to the police station and ask for your help

1128
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:40,780
I am leaving

1129
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:42,780
The police station

1130
01:08:51,780 --> 01:08:53,780
Wait, don't worry

1131
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:54,780
Go

1132
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:03,780
Thank you

1133
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:05,780
Thank you

1134
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:07,780
Come to the police station

1135
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:12,780
Go

1136
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:42,780
Go

1137
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:12,780
Boss, the investigation results are out

1138
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:17,780
The case is here

1139
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:19,780
It's your father's case

1140
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:32,780
You suspected Fang Dong and your father's divorce

1141
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:34,780
Maybe there is something else

1142
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:36,780
You should go and investigate it

1143
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:38,780
I didn't expect to get such a result

1144
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:41,780
I am very shocked, sorry

1145
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:50,780
When did this happen?

1146
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:55,780
I mean

1147
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:58,780
My father and this girl

1148
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:01,780
It was your father's suicide that year

1149
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:04,780
Because this is a great scandal for Fang Jia

1150
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:06,780
So the news was pressed by Fang Jia

1151
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:08,780
So the news was pressed by Fang Jia

1152
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:10,780
So it didn't get reported

1153
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:28,780
I am going to the police station

1154
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:30,780
I need to listen to the police

1155
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:32,780
Boss, are you sure you want to do this?

1156
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:34,780
I mean, tomorrow you and Da Shao

1157
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:36,780
I will be there in three years

1158
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:39,780
But what should I do?

1159
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:52,780
I want to confirm the case again

1160
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:54,780
I want to confirm the case again

1161
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:57,780
Okay, that's it

1162
01:11:57,780 --> 01:11:59,780
Why are you here?

1163
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:01,780
Nothing

1164
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:05,780
I came to see the kidney

1165
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,780
I came to see you

1166
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:15,780
It's strange

1167
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:17,780
Although my memory is back

1168
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:22,780
Although I know the kidney is important

1169
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:26,780
I know that I am not a good person

1170
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:29,780
But I don't remember why

1171
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:32,780
Do you know the reason?

1172
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:37,780
It's because your father

1173
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:40,780
Is the place where you miss that person

1174
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:48,780
Really?

1175
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:55,780
Since I don't remember now

1176
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:58,780
Why don't we have the kidney?

1177
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:04,780
Guangxi, what are you talking about?

1178
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:07,780
How could you forget?

1179
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:10,780
You still remember?

1180
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:20,780
But I remember the truth

1181
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:29,780
I remember you and Bao Li went to the hospital

1182
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:33,780
I remember you two quarreling

1183
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:40,780
I remember he was stupid

1184
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:43,780
But I never knew

1185
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:47,780
That thing happened

1186
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:52,780
18 years ago

1187
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:55,780
It's you, dad

1188
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:05,780
Why didn't you tell me?

1189
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:07,780
The reason you and Bao Li got married

1190
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:10,780
Is because he betrayed you

1191
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:16,780
Because he had a relationship with his girl

1192
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:18,780
And he was in a mess

1193
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:21,780
So you two quarreled everyday

1194
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:26,780
That's why you left this house

1195
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:31,780
That's why you got divorced

1196
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:54,780
What do you want?

1197
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:56,780
I don't regret

1198
01:14:57,780 --> 01:14:59,780
At least we know about it

1199
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:02,780
We cherish each other

1200
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:20,780
Don't let Guangxi know

1201
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:23,780
Don't let Guangxi know

1202
01:15:28,780 --> 01:15:30,780
I don't want to have dad since I was a kid

1203
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:35,780
So I can forgive you

1204
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:39,780
I just hope you

1205
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:42,780
Don't let Guangxi know

1206
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:46,780
Keep pretending

1207
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:53,780
I don't want to forget

1208
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:57,780
I don't want to remember the memories of the childhood

1209
01:16:03,780 --> 01:16:05,780
Let go of your dirty hands

1210
01:16:20,780 --> 01:16:22,780
Dad killed himself because

1211
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:24,780
It wasn't what I wanted

1212
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:28,780
You two forced him to leave

1213
01:16:30,780 --> 01:16:32,780
He took that girl to Japan

1214
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:37,780
To the hotel to kill himself

1215
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:44,780
But that girl turned out to be a rebel

1216
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:48,780
She died alone

1217
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:54,780
You are protecting me, right?

1218
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:59,780
To stop dad's image from coming back

1219
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:03,780
You can let me misunderstand you

1220
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:07,780
Don't let me know that my dad is like that

1221
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:16,780
So you didn't take the sugarcane

1222
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:18,780
Not because I'm stubborn

1223
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:22,780
It's because you can't forget dad

1224
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:29,780
You made me think too much

1225
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:48,780
I love him

1226
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:50,780
Don't pretend to be desperate

1227
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:55,780
My heart is deeply hurt

1228
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:57,780
But it won't forget

1229
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:03,780
So you didn't take the sugarcane

1230
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:05,780
for so many years

1231
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:08,780
Not because I'm stubborn

1232
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:11,780
It's because you can't forget dad

1233
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:18,780
You made me think too much

1234
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:35,780
Actually, I'm still very strange

1235
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:43,780
Until now, I still can't forgive him completely

1236
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:49,780
As for the smell you said

1237
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:54,780
It was really because you were too young

1238
01:18:55,780 --> 01:18:57,780
I don't know why I'm so honest with you

1239
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:01,780
So I didn't say anything

1240
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:06,780
Maybe

1241
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:11,780
Maybe the mood is different now

1242
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:18,780
I admit

1243
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:24,780
I have some concerns for you

1244
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:30,780
This is the reason why the sugarcane can be preserved

1245
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:39,780
Because the sugarcane is where we meet

1246
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:41,780
At that time

1247
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:45,780
He was a music teacher

1248
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:49,780
I was Dong's daughter

1249
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:56,780
I was thinking if

1250
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:02,780
If I take the sugarcane away

1251
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:05,780
It means

1252
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:09,780
I'm afraid you'll leave it to me

1253
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:16,780
I've bought all the memories of my memories

1254
01:20:20,780 --> 01:20:22,780
I don't want to do that

1255
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:29,780
As for Xiaolin

1256
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:31,780
Don't worry

1257
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:35,780
He's really my good friend

1258
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:38,780
He's also the best assistant in our family

1259
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:41,780
For so many years

1260
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:45,780
He's always been by our side

1261
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:48,780
He has no doubts

1262
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:54,780
How can you make me

1263
01:20:55,780 --> 01:20:57,780
Just like misunderstanding

1264
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:00,780
Just like hate you

1265
01:21:01,780 --> 01:21:03,780
For so many years

1266
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:10,780
Why do you have to bear all this alone?

1267
01:21:11,780 --> 01:21:12,780
Because

1268
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:18,780
I think it's for your own good

1269
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:24,780
I always feel that it makes you happier

1270
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:28,780
So I'm hiding it from you

1271
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:33,780
Just like you are now

1272
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:37,780
You want to let them be free

1273
01:21:38,780 --> 01:21:40,780
Not for Mu Chen and Xiao Le

1274
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:43,780
So you choose to leave them

1275
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:46,780
And pretend to be close to you

1276
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:52,780
But I know

1277
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:56,780
I know you're not good

1278
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:04,780
I know you're not good

1279
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:08,780
You're not good

1280
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:13,780
You're not good

1281
01:22:14,780 --> 01:22:16,780
I know

1282
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:19,780
You have a chance to make a move

1283
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:23,780
You're more lucky than me

1284
01:22:25,780 --> 01:22:27,780
Why don't you take good care of me?

1285
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:33,780
How to treat you

1286
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:40,780
I really don't want you to be the same as me

1287
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:44,780
I regret missing myself

1288
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:46,780
I should have

1289
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:54,780
I'm sorry

1290
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:05,780
Because you're my son

1291
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:11,780
Because I love you

1292
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:21,780
Love has many ways

1293
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:27,780
Maybe my way is not right

1294
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:33,780
You can not accept it

1295
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:37,780
But

1296
01:23:39,780 --> 01:23:40,780
Love

1297
01:23:42,780 --> 01:23:44,780
Love's true heart

1298
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:47,780
You shouldn't doubt it

1299
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:55,780
I think Mu Chen should be like this

1300
01:24:02,780 --> 01:24:07,780
My son has grown up

1301
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:12,780
So you can figure it out

1302
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:15,780
What do you want to do?

1303
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:21,780
I support you

1304
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:33,780
I'll go to the clinic

1305
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:37,780
Xiao Lin, tell He Yue to check on me

1306
01:24:39,780 --> 01:24:40,780
Mom

1307
01:24:40,780 --> 01:24:42,780
I'll go to the clinic

1308
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:46,780
Xiao Lin, tell He Yue to check on me

1309
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:01,780
I never told you

1310
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:05,780
I'm sorry

1311
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:08,780
Thank you

1312
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:18,780
It's okay

1313
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,780
It's okay

1314
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:25,780
Come on

1315
01:25:35,780 --> 01:25:37,780
I'm sorry

1316
01:25:56,780 --> 01:25:57,780
I'm sorry

1317
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:01,780
I don't know how to treat you

1318
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:08,780
Thank you for being with my mom

1319
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:11,780
I've been looking for her for so long

1320
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:17,780
Guangxi

1321
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:19,780
Although you've been with her for so long

1322
01:26:19,780 --> 01:26:22,780
It's not hard to tell her feelings

1323
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:26,780
Before you went to America

1324
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:28,780
Did you have something to tell Mu Chen?

1325
01:26:35,780 --> 01:26:39,780
I was afraid that I'd have trouble with my hands

1326
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:41,780
Sorry

1327
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:45,780
Mu Chen, you're coming tomorrow to Guangxi

1328
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:46,780
Right?

1329
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:49,780
Yeah

1330
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:53,780
Because Mu Chen is thinking

1331
01:26:53,780 --> 01:26:55,780
What I'm going to do for him tomorrow

1332
01:26:55,780 --> 01:26:57,780
I'm going to be a good girl

1333
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:00,780
I'm sorry

1334
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:02,780
I'm sorry

1335
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:03,780
You're thinking

1336
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:05,780
What I'm going to do for Guangxi

1337
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:07,780
And Uncle He Yue to eat

1338
01:27:08,780 --> 01:27:09,780
Where's the beef?

1339
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:11,780
You said before

1340
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:14,780
Guangxi promised bad guys

1341
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:16,780
So I'm going to cook beef for him

1342
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:19,780
Then Guangxi is angry

1343
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:20,780
Guangxi is very happy

1344
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:22,780
And then Xiao Lin

1345
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:25,780
I'm coming

1346
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:27,780
Then

1347
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:28,780
No

1348
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:31,780
Gui Yi

1349
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:34,780
Then Guangxi likes beef

1350
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:41,780
Mu Chen, don't make me say it again

1351
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:46,780
Because I want to grow up a little bit

1352
01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:47,780
I'll understand

1353
01:27:49,780 --> 01:27:51,780
Actually he's very strange

1354
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:54,780
The one I used to like

1355
01:27:55,780 --> 01:27:57,780
Now I don't like it

1356
01:27:57,780 --> 01:27:59,780
The two of us will be together because of love

1357
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:00,780
But often

1358
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:02,780
Because of the reason for liking each other

1359
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:13,780
Go to sleep

1360
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:19,780
Mom's medicine is first

1361
01:28:19,780 --> 01:28:21,780
So tomorrow I'll be in Ren Guangxi

1362
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:23,780
And play the role of Luo Ka

1363
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:24,780
Gui Yi

1364
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:26,780
I'll always be with Xiao Fang

1365
01:28:31,780 --> 01:28:32,780
Then you?

1366
01:28:34,780 --> 01:28:36,780
How can I thank Ren Guangxi?

1367
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:39,780
He always said

1368
01:28:40,780 --> 01:28:42,780
Now I'm more worried about

1369
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:44,780
After they finish eating

1370
01:28:44,780 --> 01:28:47,780
How do you explain our relationship?

1371
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:49,780
Ren Guangxi told me

1372
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:52,780
But you can't move back

1373
01:28:52,780 --> 01:28:55,780
How can I not see what's wrong between us?

1374
01:28:55,780 --> 01:28:57,780
It's all my fault

1375
01:28:58,780 --> 01:28:59,780
I know

1376
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:02,780
If it wasn't for you

1377
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:05,780
He wouldn't have helped me

1378
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:11,780
You

1379
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:13,780
Don't worry

1380
01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:17,780
Actually

1381
01:29:17,780 --> 01:29:19,780
I planned to

1382
01:29:19,780 --> 01:29:20,780
After the relationship

1383
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:22,780
I'll find him to talk about it

1384
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:25,780
But I don't know if he'll accept it

1385
01:29:26,780 --> 01:29:28,780
Even if he doesn't accept it

1386
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:31,780
Did you tell him

1387
01:29:31,780 --> 01:29:33,780
How much you care about him?

1388
01:29:36,780 --> 01:29:39,780
The problem has nothing to do with his choice

1389
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:42,780
Even if he wants to keep misunderstanding

1390
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:44,780
He doesn't love you anymore

1391
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:46,780
The most important thing now

1392
01:29:46,780 --> 01:29:49,780
Is that you should tell him your feelings

1393
01:29:50,780 --> 01:29:52,780
Not only for you

1394
01:29:52,780 --> 01:29:54,780
For Xiao Le

1395
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:56,780
But also for Ren Guangxi

1396
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:05,780
Mo Chen

1397
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:08,780
Because he's so hardworking

1398
01:30:08,780 --> 01:30:10,780
Think about it

1399
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:11,780
Six years ago

1400
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:13,780
He was sick because of you

1401
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:16,780
He was sick because of you

1402
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:17,780
Until then

1403
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:19,780
He lost his memory

1404
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:22,780
But he tried so hard to think about you

1405
01:30:22,780 --> 01:30:24,780
But now

1406
01:30:26,780 --> 01:30:29,780
He tried to leave you

1407
01:30:29,780 --> 01:30:30,780
Mo Chen

1408
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:33,780
Actually you're not fair to him

1409
01:30:33,780 --> 01:30:36,780
Because you never told him

1410
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:40,780
You love him

1411
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:42,780
Bravely

1412
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:46,780
When you're afraid

1413
01:30:46,780 --> 01:30:48,780
Ren Guangxi gave you courage

1414
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:51,780
But now you're afraid of him

1415
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:53,780
Shouldn't you

1416
01:30:53,780 --> 01:30:55,780
Give him courage?

1417
01:30:56,780 --> 01:30:59,780
I know he might hurt you

1418
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:03,780
But shouldn't you give him another chance?

1419
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:06,780
One time is enough

1420
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:07,780
One more time

1421
01:31:08,780 --> 01:31:10,780
You can't be a person

1422
01:31:10,780 --> 01:31:12,780
Who's always waiting

1423
01:31:13,780 --> 01:31:16,780
Because happiness

1424
01:31:16,780 --> 01:31:19,780
Is to rely on yourself to pursue it

1425
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:25,780
Duoyan

1426
01:31:26,780 --> 01:31:28,780
Thank you

1427
01:31:42,780 --> 01:31:45,780
My heart is deeply hurt

1428
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:48,780
But I won't forget

1429
01:31:48,780 --> 01:31:50,780
We're not

1430
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:52,780
Mo Chen

1431
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:55,780
You told me just now

1432
01:31:55,780 --> 01:31:57,780
I think you're in the bathroom

1433
01:31:57,780 --> 01:31:58,780
You want Xiao Le to stay with you

1434
01:31:58,780 --> 01:31:59,780
We'll be back soon

1435
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:02,780
And

1436
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:03,780
If Xiao Le knows

1437
01:32:03,780 --> 01:32:04,780
Ren Guangxi must come

1438
01:32:08,780 --> 01:32:10,780
Mo Chen, come here

1439
01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:12,780
You're always here

1440
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:14,780
You're in the bathroom

1441
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:16,780
You're the one who's been here

1442
01:32:16,780 --> 01:32:18,780
You're the one who's been here

1443
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:20,780
You're in the bathroom

1444
01:32:20,780 --> 01:32:22,780
You're the one who's been here

1445
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:26,280
what's up

1446
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:27,780
What's up

1447
01:32:38,780 --> 01:32:39,780
She sn guards

1448
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:41,780
Wangлюa mouths out to talk about

1449
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:43,280
the bad news

1450
01:32:44,780 --> 01:32:45,780
Excuse me

1451
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:47,780
Boss is்?

1452
01:32:47,780 --> 01:32:49,040
But he knows

1453
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:51,780
That everyone has invited him

1454
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:53,020
I want to thank you for telling me

1455
01:32:53,020 --> 01:32:55,220
That's not what I meant

1456
01:32:55,220 --> 01:32:57,820
I'm a big fan of you

1457
01:32:57,820 --> 01:32:59,900
People don't even know how to talk to me

1458
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:02,260
That's not what I meant

1459
01:33:03,260 --> 01:33:04,460
About this

1460
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:06,940
Boss told me something

1461
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:09,460
I want to talk to Ms. Yang

1462
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:12,140
What are you talking about?

1463
01:33:12,140 --> 01:33:14,140
You're the boss, I'm the boss

1464
01:33:14,140 --> 01:33:14,780
I'm telling you

1465
01:33:14,780 --> 01:33:16,660
I'm the boss, I'm the boss

1466
01:33:16,660 --> 01:33:18,100
What's the problem?

1467
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:19,460
What?

1468
01:33:20,020 --> 01:33:20,980
It's okay

1469
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:23,220
Just tell me what's going on

1470
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:33,220
Ms. Yang

1471
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:34,420
Who's the boss?

1472
01:33:34,420 --> 01:33:35,420
I'm the boss

1473
01:33:36,620 --> 01:33:37,620
What's the matter?

1474
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:39,220
You're the boss, I'm the boss

1475
01:33:51,580 --> 01:33:52,580
What's the matter?

1476
01:33:52,580 --> 01:33:53,580
Li... Li... Li Wen?

1477
01:33:53,580 --> 01:33:54,580
Unless...

1478
01:33:55,580 --> 01:33:57,980
This Li Wen is very good at the medical condition

1479
01:33:57,980 --> 01:34:00,180
The boss will pay you a very high amount of money

1480
01:34:00,180 --> 01:34:02,580
And you'll buy a house for yourself

1481
01:34:02,580 --> 01:34:04,980
You can even use a flower shop

1482
01:34:04,980 --> 01:34:06,980
The boss won't let you sign up

1483
01:34:06,980 --> 01:34:08,980
You can see it clearly and think about it

1484
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:15,980
No, he's really a good guy

1485
01:34:15,980 --> 01:34:16,980
He's a good guy

1486
01:34:16,980 --> 01:34:17,980
He's a good guy

1487
01:34:17,980 --> 01:34:18,980
He's a good guy

1488
01:34:18,980 --> 01:34:20,980
He's really a good guy

1489
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:21,980
He's not a big guy

1490
01:34:21,980 --> 01:34:22,980
He's a kid

1491
01:34:22,980 --> 01:34:23,980
He's really a good guy

1492
01:34:23,980 --> 01:34:24,980
He's a kid

1493
01:34:25,980 --> 01:34:27,980
The boss has already told us about this

1494
01:34:28,980 --> 01:34:30,980
He knows you care more about the kids than anything else

1495
01:34:30,980 --> 01:34:32,980
So he's willing to give up on the medical rights

1496
01:34:32,980 --> 01:34:34,980
And not to give you a baby

1497
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:36,980
If you only hope that

1498
01:34:36,980 --> 01:34:39,980
You can take Xiao Le to Taipei every weekend

1499
01:34:39,980 --> 01:34:42,980
Because he's worried that Mr. Fang will miss his grandson

1500
01:34:48,980 --> 01:34:50,980
He doesn't even want Xiao Le

1501
01:34:52,980 --> 01:34:53,980
He's a good guy

1502
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:55,980
He's a good guy

1503
01:34:55,980 --> 01:34:56,980
He's a good guy

1504
01:34:56,980 --> 01:34:58,980
He really wants to marry you

1505
01:34:59,980 --> 01:35:01,980
How can Xiao Le have the other dad to meet him?

1506
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:03,980
How can we explain it to him now?

1507
01:35:05,980 --> 01:35:07,980
Take this back

1508
01:35:07,980 --> 01:35:08,980
Tell the staff

1509
01:35:08,980 --> 01:35:10,980
Don't be a coward

1510
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:13,980
You can take it yourself

1511
01:35:13,980 --> 01:35:15,980
The boss is not willing to come

1512
01:35:15,980 --> 01:35:17,980
He's going to America this afternoon

1513
01:35:17,980 --> 01:35:19,980
And

1514
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:21,980
I don't even know when he'll come back

1515
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:22,980
He's your boss

1516
01:35:22,980 --> 01:35:23,980
How can you not know?

1517
01:35:23,980 --> 01:35:24,980
I'm serious

1518
01:35:24,980 --> 01:35:26,980
The boss is going to America to attend the four-part interview

1519
01:35:26,980 --> 01:35:28,980
It's just a reason for him to come

1520
01:35:28,980 --> 01:35:32,980
The real reason is to meet with the staff

1521
01:35:32,980 --> 01:35:34,980
They want to tease the boss

1522
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:36,980
And it's been a long time since the meeting

1523
01:35:37,980 --> 01:35:39,980
If the boss goes well

1524
01:35:39,980 --> 01:35:41,980
The chance of leaving is very high

1525
01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:43,980
Moreover

1526
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:45,980
All the ladies are in America now

1527
01:35:46,980 --> 01:35:49,980
The old friends are going to stay in America for a while

1528
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:51,980
It's not impossible

1529
01:35:53,980 --> 01:35:55,980
Mr. Guo said

1530
01:35:56,980 --> 01:35:59,980
The boss made a single-party ticket

1531
01:35:59,980 --> 01:36:01,980
That is to say

1532
01:36:01,980 --> 01:36:03,980
He didn't come back to the plan for the time being

1533
01:36:03,980 --> 01:36:05,980
Boss, get up

1534
01:36:06,980 --> 01:36:07,980
Get up

1535
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:09,980
I'm going to take care of him

1536
01:36:09,980 --> 01:36:12,980
I'm going to America or Africa now

1537
01:36:12,980 --> 01:36:14,980
What's he going to do now?

1538
01:36:14,980 --> 01:36:16,980
He's going to marry Mu Chen

1539
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:17,980
He's going to divorce him

1540
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:19,980
What does he want to be our Mu Chen?

1541
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:21,980
Tell him that

1542
01:36:22,980 --> 01:36:24,980
Mu Chen will not sign the divorce agreement

1543
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:26,980
He's going to divorce him

1544
01:36:26,980 --> 01:36:29,980
We'll wait for him here

1545
01:36:30,980 --> 01:36:31,980
Miss Liang

1546
01:36:31,980 --> 01:36:33,980
You decide to fight with me

1547
01:36:33,980 --> 01:36:34,980
I'm leaving

1548
01:36:35,980 --> 01:36:36,980
You...

1549
01:36:36,980 --> 01:36:37,980
Tuoyuan

1550
01:36:38,980 --> 01:36:40,980
Don't be like this

1551
01:36:40,980 --> 01:36:42,980
It seems

1552
01:36:43,980 --> 01:36:45,980
He's really very disappointed with me

1553
01:36:50,980 --> 01:36:51,980
Mu Chen

1554
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:53,980
I'm going to marry him

1555
01:36:53,980 --> 01:36:55,980
I'm not going to do it

1556
01:36:58,980 --> 01:36:59,980
Hello

1557
01:37:05,980 --> 01:37:06,980
Tuoyuan

1558
01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:09,980
Tuoyuan

1559
01:37:09,980 --> 01:37:11,980
Why did you give me a flower?

1560
01:37:11,980 --> 01:37:13,980
He's not going to marry you

1561
01:37:13,980 --> 01:37:15,980
Just like you

1562
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:16,980
Then

1563
01:37:16,980 --> 01:37:19,980
Can you give me a flower next time?

1564
01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:22,980
A client asked you to help him

1565
01:37:22,980 --> 01:37:25,980
He said he wanted to leave all the property to his daughter

1566
01:37:26,980 --> 01:37:28,980
What do you want to do with the people who said he was a kid?

1567
01:37:28,980 --> 01:37:30,980
We're all brothers

1568
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:32,980
Why can't you help us?

1569
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:34,980
Let's call the police first

1570
01:37:34,980 --> 01:37:36,980
This is the conspiracy

1571
01:37:36,980 --> 01:37:38,980
I have too many doubts about you

1572
01:37:38,980 --> 01:37:40,980
If we split up, it would be better

1573
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:43,980
If we are like the wind

1574
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:45,980
No matter how many chances we have, we can get out

1575
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:47,980
The result should be the same

1576
01:37:47,980 --> 01:37:49,980
Because

1577
01:37:49,980 --> 01:37:51,980
You are my destiny

1578
01:38:33,980 --> 01:38:35,980
I'm so tired

1579
01:38:37,980 --> 01:38:40,980
Why are you so helpless

1580
01:38:40,980 --> 01:38:43,980
You can't even love me

1581
01:38:48,980 --> 01:38:51,980
You always come to love

1582
01:38:51,980 --> 01:38:54,980
You still make people open their eyes

1583
01:38:55,980 --> 01:38:59,980
I'm looking forward to the future

1584
01:39:00,980 --> 01:39:03,980
You always come to love

1585
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:07,980
You still make people open their eyes

1586
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:12,980
I should be like this
