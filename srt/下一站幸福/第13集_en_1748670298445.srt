00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,400
The Next Media

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,500
Good morning.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Morning. Why are you up so early?

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You must be used to sleeping in the place where we're staying.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This is what it looks like when a lawyer just came.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Lawyer?

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Why did you suddenly call me so mysterious?

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I think you should have been a good host before.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I came here by chance and met you.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
He told me about what happened six years ago.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Actually, I met you six years ago.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Sometimes, the topic of the wedding is always you.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
In his eyes, he's a great girl.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
He really cares about you.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I've been thinking about it.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If I could meet you,

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I would be so happy to see you.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm not sure if I can meet you.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not sure.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm not sure.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm not sure.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm not sure.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm not sure.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
If I could meet you,

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I would like to ask you personally.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Why did you do that?

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Why did you abandon a man who would do anything for you?

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
No one can do that.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Unless you don't love him enough.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
When two people are together,

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
of course,

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
when there's no reason to love,

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
of course.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But when I find out

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
that he might leave me at any time,

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
he will face the problem of reality.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm not the one who can accept that.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm not the one who can accept that.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm not the one who can accept that.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm not the one who can protect you.

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So you're leaving Guangxi with Xiao Le's father?

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yes.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What about Xiao Le?

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Can you be her mother alone

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and take her with you?

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But you don't have the courage to go through the difficulties with her?

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Xiao Le.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm leaving Guangxi.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
After I come here,

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'll be your mother.

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I can choose.

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I choose to leave him.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And I can choose not to be

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
the one who lives in Guangxi.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And I don't have the ability to protect him.

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Do you know that?

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Do you know that?

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
If you see the final state of Guangxi's surgery,

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
you won't be as rational as you are now.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Six years ago,

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
when you were Xiao Le's mother,

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
when you were called your mother,

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
that person was thrown into the public's hands by you.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The surgery was done.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
He lost all his ability to be recognized.

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Like a child with five years of age,

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
he was afraid of this world.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Because he didn't recognize his mother,

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
he didn't know how to speak.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
When you were calling Xiao Le's mother

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and she was walking,

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
that person was thrown into the public's hands.

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
He was alone in the public's room.

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
A big man with 180 cm.

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He was walking.

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He was talking.

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
He was walking.

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
994466.

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Com.

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You are falling on the ground.

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Have you ever thought of what kind of sight others will have when they turn their heads?

83
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
How can you use chopsticks to get his back to learn?

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's painful,

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
it's hard to see,

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
it's helpless.

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
He has come through.

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He won't tell others about this.

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But the most pitiful thing is,

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
you left him at the beginning,

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and he didn't know anything.

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I told you this today.

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I told you this today.

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I don't want you to do anything.

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Because no one can make up for it.

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The air is hurt.

97
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I just hope

98
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
you at least have a little bit of it.

99
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm sorry for Guangxi.

100
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I don't need to feel sorry for this.

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I don't want him to do anything.

102
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You are brave enough to face this.

103
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You are the most suitable person for Guangxi.

104
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What's wrong with that?

105
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Guangxi,

106
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Mr. Huatuo,

107
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
and his father.

108
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
They are all here.

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
They are all here.

110
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
They are all here.

111
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
They are all here.

112
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And Xiao Le's father.

113
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Are they the men you taught me at the same time?

114
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
How can you treat Guangxi like this?

115
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yes,

116
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
you are right.

117
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
But it doesn't matter.

118
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
He has you now.

119
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The past should be the past.

120
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm not happy with him.

121
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm just a very unhappy memory.

122
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So I don't need to remember.

123
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I just want to ask you,

124
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
will you tell him

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
everything you know?

126
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Like you said,

127
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
this is a unhappy memory.

128
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
When he knows that

129
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
he cares about the person

130
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
he doesn't want to be with,

131
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
he doesn't care about him at all.

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Is this better?

133
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Mu Zeng is with me now.

134
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I don't want him to have

135
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
any relationship with Guangxi.

136
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
They are so ignorant.

137
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
They won't take care of him.

138
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Miss,

139
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
go and get your wedding done.

140
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What are you talking about?

141
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Nothing.

142
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm praying for you and Miss He

143
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
to be happy.

144
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I also hope you two

145
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
can pray for us.

146
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Can you, Miss He?

147
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Trust me.

148
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'll be happy for you.

149
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What's wrong?

150
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Nothing.

151
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I just want to hug you

152
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
and tell you that I'll protect you.

153
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I got it.

154
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You have a wedding

155
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
and you're going to be married.

156
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm not going to marry you.

157
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm not going to marry you.

158
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm not going to marry you.

159
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm not going to marry you.

160
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm not going to marry you.

161
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Miss He,

162
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
where are you going to sleep?

163
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm going to sleep.

164
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
This is how I sleep.

165
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'll make you a bed.

166
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'll make you a bed.

167
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'll make you a bed.

168
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You're the bride.

169
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The bride is like this.

170
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
She's not like this.

171
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
This is the wedding dress you're wearing.

172
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You're so polite.

173
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
No, I'm not.

174
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm just like this.

175
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm not going to marry you.

176
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm not going to marry you.

177
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'll make you a wedding dress.

178
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'll make you a wedding dress.

179
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'll take you to the temple.

180
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You'll marry me.

181
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'll make you a wedding dress.

182
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'll make you a wedding dress.

183
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'll make you a wedding dress.

184
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Thank you.

185
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'll take you to the temple.

186
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Miss He,

187
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
wait for me.

188
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Miss He,

189
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
look at your clothes.

190
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
This is your wife's wedding dress.

191
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That's right.

192
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
This is the wedding dress.

193
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I took it from her.

194
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
She left in a hurry.

195
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Here you are.

196
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Where's He?

197
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
He's in the room.

198
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What's wrong?

199
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Is he in a hurry?

200
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
No.

201
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You're going to the breakfast.

202
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
The plastic bag is ready to go to class.

203
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Go.

204
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
He really thanked you.

205
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Don't thank me.

206
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I wasn't helping you.

207
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I wasn't acting.

208
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That's what I wanted.

209
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Six years ago,

210
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
you saved me in the data.

211
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You gave me

212
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
this new wedding dress.

213
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I really think

214
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
that day,

215
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I was so lucky.

216
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Because I knew him.

217
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
He didn't want to know.

218
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
When I got this dress,

219
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I decided

220
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
to wait for you

221
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
until the day you were born.

222
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You're the girl I want.

223
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Until now,

224
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I would still have this dress.

225
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I would take it out

226
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
as long as I think of you.

227
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Sometimes,

228
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
no matter when you are,

229
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
you will always see me.

230
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I will always wait for you here.

231
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I know you always understand me.

232
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I just don't want to change the relationship between us.

233
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I also thought

234
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I would wait for you like this.

235
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
But just now,

236
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I realized

237
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I don't want to let you go again.

238
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I don't want to see you go back to the way you were.

239
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I don't want to see you cry.

240
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Don't tell me

241
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
that you can take care of yourself.

242
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
But you're lying to yourself.

243
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You don't want to give up.

244
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Because

245
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I don't know how to give up.

246
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Don't ask me where I like you.

247
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Because I will always like you.

248
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Because I will always like you.

249
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I just

250
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
want to be the one who is by your side.

251
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I want to protect you.

252
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I want to take care of you and Xiao Ran.

253
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
My love.

254
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Okay?

255
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I think

256
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I still have other plans.

257
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Dear.

258
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I will be the problem�

259
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
with you.

260
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Xiao Ran.

261
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Xiao Ran.

262
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Don't tell me

263
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
that you want to avoid

264
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,960
my love.

265
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,280
I'm so desperate

266
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,560
Give me a little hope

267
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:16,760
Hope is not hope

268
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,540
Da lleg

269
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:09,600
You finally gave me the company emotion

270
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,800
you have given me nothing

271
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,960
Xiao Le

272
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,960
This is my address.

273
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,960
I promise you,

274
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,960
I'll come to see you when I'm free.

275
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,960
You can write to me.

276
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,960
I'll use the drawing.

277
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,960
After you arrive at the primary school.

278
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,960
Okay?

279
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,960
What's wrong?

280
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,960
I won't come back to see you.

281
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,960
I'm not saying I have to be happy and happy.

282
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,960
I'm so happy.

283
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,960
I'm so happy.

284
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,960
I'm so happy.

285
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,960
I'm so happy.

286
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,960
Please.

287
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,960
Please.

288
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,960
What's wrong?

289
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,960
What's this?

290
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,960
When I was lonely,

291
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,960
I saw her.

292
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,960
I hope she can understand my feeling.

293
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,960
She can miss my feeling.

294
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,960
I hope she can come back to me soon.

295
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,960
Tell me who I am.

296
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,960
Who are you?

297
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
No.

298
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,960
Maybe...

299
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,960
Maybe I'm not like this.

300
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,960
Or I'm not important to her.

301
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,960
Xiaole.

302
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,960
You're important to me.

303
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,960
When you miss me,

304
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,960
you tell her,

305
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,960
Miss you, Miss you.

306
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,960
I'll feel it.

307
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,960
Xiaole.

308
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,960
Be good.

309
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,960
Stay there.

310
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,960
You're so good and sensible.

311
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,960
If I can have a child,

312
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,960
I'll be so cute.

313
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,960
Xiaole.

314
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,960
Xiaole.

315
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,960
Take good care of them.

316
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,960
Please take good care of Xiaole.

317
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,960
I know.

318
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,960
Get in the car.

319
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
Miss will be waiting for you.

320
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,960
Xiaole.

321
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,960
Xiaole.

322
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,960
Xiaole.

323
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,960
Xiaole.

324
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,960
Xiaole.

325
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,960
Xiaole.

326
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,960
Xiaole.

327
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,960
Hello, He Dong.

328
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,960
Guan Yihua really is my substitute for Guangxi Tianing.

329
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,960
She did take good care of you recently.

330
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,960
You're in good hands.

331
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,960
How much is it?

332
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,960
I don't know.

333
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,960
I'm sorry.

334
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,960
I'm sorry.

335
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,960
I'm sorry.

336
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,960
I'm sorry.

337
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,960
I'm sorry.

338
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,960
I'm sorry.

339
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,960
Thank you.

340
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,960
No problem.

341
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,960
I put myself through a lot.

342
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,960
I'm not at fault in doing what I meant.

343
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,960
Any damage will just come down to me.

344
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,960
If there is anything I can do,

345
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,960
I will know what to do.

346
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,960
Xiao самое,

347
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,960
Don't you worried about this aspect of this� prompting agency?

348
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,960
So true.

349
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,960
How are you doing?

350
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,960
So it looks like there are no obstacle signs,

351
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,960
We'll walk down the road we've walked down for her

352
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,960
You're back

353
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
Mom

354
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,960
What's this?

355
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,960
This is a gift for us

356
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,960
You're here to get your future father-in-law

357
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,960
Mom, I'm not wrong about the company

358
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,960
He helped Cui Ming to help him make the compensation

359
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,960
He didn't want to hurt her

360
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,960
I'll talk to him about that

361
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,960
I'll apologize to the chairman

362
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,960
Don't make it hard for Yixing

363
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,960
You know what's best for you

364
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,960
He's back to Taipei and he's about to retire

365
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,960
He forgot about the flower shop

366
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,960
You two are getting married soon

367
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,960
You should focus on the wedding

368
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,960
Yixing, the documents from the wedding are all here

369
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,960
Really? I'll go and check

370
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,960
I'm a little tired. I'll go and get my luggage

371
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,960
Here you go

372
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,960
Are you tired?

373
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,960
Let me see

374
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:11,960
Yixing, did you find anything special about the flower shop?

375
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,960
Did you change Guangxi's mind?

376
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,960
Guangxi

377
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,960
Guangxi is a kind and friendly village

378
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,960
They don't only care about their father's injury

379
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,960
They also give us gifts

380
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,960
They also help us to organize the wedding

381
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,960
I think Guangxi doesn't remember the past

382
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,960
But she can still be friends with friends in the flower shop

383
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,960
Mom, are we all hoping Guangxi can be happy?

384
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,960
But he's happy now

385
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,960
I'm so happy

386
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,960
I'm so happy

387
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,960
I'm so happy

388
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,960
I'm so happy

389
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,960
I'm so happy

390
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,960
I'm so happy

391
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,960
I'm so happy

392
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,960
I'm so happy

393
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,960
I'm so happy

394
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,960
I'm so happy

395
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,960
I'm so happy

396
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,960
I'm so happy

397
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,960
I'm so happy

398
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,960
I'm so happy

399
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,960
I'm so happy

400
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,960
What are you laughing at?

401
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,960
When I was in the flower shop

402
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,960
I helped Xiao Le to help her father

403
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,960
She wanted to thank me

404
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,960
So she gave me a reward

405
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,960
She helped me to withdraw the money for 10 minutes

406
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,960
She saved up a lot of money

407
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,960
Xiao Le is really good

408
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,960
Miss Yang taught her very well

409
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,960
She's very good

410
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,960
She's very good

411
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,960
Miss Yang taught her very well

412
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,960
But being a single mother is really not easy

413
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,960
At least Mr. Hua has been with her and supported her

414
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,960
Tuo Wei really treats them well

415
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,960
It's also Tuo Wei who took Huai Tianchun with her to the flower shop

416
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,960
She's been taking care of them all the way

417
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,960
I hope they're happy too

418
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,960
You said Six years ago, Miss Yang was the one who met Huai Tianchun

419
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,960
Yes, what's wrong?

420
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,960
Xiao Le left Guangxi

421
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,960
She came here and found a shadow

422
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,960
Who is Xiao Le's father?

423
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,960
I don't know who Xiao Le's father is

424
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,960
But he doesn't want to have anything to do with her

425
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,960
So he left Huai Tianchun

426
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,960
He's taking all the responsibility

427
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,960
I don't know what Xiao Le is doing now

428
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,960
Okay

429
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,960
It's okay

430
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,960
Mu Chen, are you far away from Taiwan?

431
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,960
A little bit

432
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,960
Are you far away from the city?

433
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,960
Xiao Le

434
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,960
Mu Chen, will you forget me when you go to Guangxi?

435
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,960
Of course I won't forget you

436
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,960
He's not writing you a letter to him

437
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,960
But I won't

438
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,960
I can write it for you

439
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,960
You can sign it

440
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,960
And I'll reply to you

441
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,960
Mu Chen, I'll teach you a way

442
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,960
Close your eyes

443
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,960
Like you're in the shape of a Guangxi

444
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,960
Can you see it?

445
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,960
Very cool

446
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,960
Listen carefully

447
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,960
Have you heard the sound of your heart beating so loudly?

448
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,960
Keep on dancing

449
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,960
Yes

450
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,960
That's the sound of you in the shape of a Guangxi

451
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:48,960
The sound of your heart beating so loudly

452
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,960
That's the sound of a thinking

453
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,960
So he's thinking of Xiao Le now

454
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,960
So he'll keep on dancing

455
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,960
He'll keep on thinking of you

456
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,960
Dad, is Yan Yan thinking of you?

457
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,960
Mu Chen, I've never been back

458
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,960
I don't care about uncle

459
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,960
That's the same

460
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,960
Xiao Le, you've said it many times

461
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,960
Uncle Guangxi is not your dad

462
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,960
I don't care

463
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,960
I don't care

464
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,960
Uncle Guangxi, I don't care

465
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,960
Xiao Le, you're so angry at Mu Chen

466
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,960
Actually, I also want to

467
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,960
I really want to

468
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,960
I really want to

469
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,960
I really want to

470
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,960
I love him

471
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,960
I hit him with my heart

472
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,960
I hurt him deeply

473
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,960
But I won't forget

474
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,960
I'm not with him

475
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,960
Hello

476
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,960
Hello

477
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,960
Take a look

478
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,960
Play

479
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,960
Play

480
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,960
You're so scared

481
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,960
You're so scared

482
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,960
You're so scared

483
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,960
Look at the pig's heart

484
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,960
You only have one egg

485
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,960
No, I only have two eggs

486
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,960
I only have one egg

487
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,960
I'm not good at it

488
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,960
I only have one egg

489
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,960
You're so scared

490
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,960
Look at your face

491
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,960
So pretty

492
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,960
Eat the egg

493
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,960
Yes

494
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,960
You're so happy

495
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,960
I'll take one egg

496
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,960
You take it

497
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,960
I'll take one egg

498
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,960
I'll take one egg

499
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,960
I'm scared

500
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,960
You'll be scared

501
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,960
I'm not scared

502
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,960
I'm not scared

503
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,960
I'm not scared

504
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,960
I want to be friends

505
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,960
I'll take one egg

506
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,960
I'll take one egg

507
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,960
I'll take one egg

508
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,960
I'll take one egg

509
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,960
Mu Chen

510
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,960
Finally, I'm pregnant

511
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,960
So handsome

512
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,960
So handsome

513
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,960
So touching

514
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,960
Don't make me cry

515
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,960
Brother

516
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,960
Are you a kid now?

517
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,960
I'm not a kid

518
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,960
You're a little girl

519
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,960
You're too small

520
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,960
Miao Jing

521
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,960
Don't cry

522
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,960
What's wrong?

523
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,960
I'm so scared

524
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,960
It's just about dancing

525
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,960
She got meetings

526
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,000
What now?

527
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:28,960
You attend my好了

528
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,960
象 spoken

529
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,960
Who is that?

530
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,960
You're beside me

531
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,960
I'm not

532
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,580
How can you say something so unattainable

533
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,380
Hey, who would you take my mistakes

534
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,820
You're a scumbag

535
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,900
You do not even know to challenge

536
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,020
Again

537
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,520
You are useless

538
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,140
So is yourıyoruz

539
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,960
What are you doing?

540
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,960
I know you're okay.

541
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,960
You're not okay.

542
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,960
That's not enough.

543
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,960
I'm telling you, I'm going to take care of you now.

544
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,960
I'm telling you, come on.

545
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,960
Use this gun to shoot me.

546
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,960
I'll shoot you.

547
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,960
I'm going to shoot you.

548
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,960
I'm going to shoot you.

549
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,960
Don't hit me again.

550
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,960
I just want this card to be okay.

551
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,960
Let's try it.

552
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,960
Let's try it.

553
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,960
Let's try it.

554
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,960
Let's see if it works.

555
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,960
I'm telling you, I'm going to shoot you.

556
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,960
Let me take you out.

557
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,960
Let me take you out.

558
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,960
Don't be so serious.

559
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,960
You're not going to let me take you out.

560
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,960
You're going to be a traitor.

561
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,960
I'm telling you, you're going to be a traitor.

562
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,960
I'm going to be a traitor.

563
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,960
I'm telling you, I'm going to shoot you.

564
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,960
I'm going to shoot you.

565
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,960
Are you sure?

566
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,960
Yes.

567
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,960
How is it?

568
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,960
Are you going to take me out?

569
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,960
I'm not going to.

570
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,960
You're not going to tell me that you're going to shoot me.

571
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,960
You're going to shoot me.

572
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,960
I'm going to take you out.

573
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,960
I'm going to shoot you.

574
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,960
You're going to be a traitor.

575
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,960
Awu, I'm not that petty.

576
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,960
I'm not that childish.

577
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,960
Come on, don't be angry.

578
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,960
Let's sing.

579
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,960
Let's order a song.

580
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,960
Come on, let's see how it works.

581
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,960
Brother Tui.

582
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,960
Brother Tui.

583
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,960
What are you doing?

584
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,960
What are you doing?

585
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,960
Brother Tui, I'm afraid that Awu won't be able to eat you tomorrow.

586
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,960
So I prepared a bentang for you.

587
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,960
It's not the same as tomorrow morning.

588
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,960
I want to sleep in Meilong's house tomorrow.

589
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,960
Brother Tui, don't be angry anymore.

590
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,960
I'm not angry.

591
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,960
You can't.

592
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,960
Okay, okay.

593
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,960
I know.

594
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,960
Go back to sleep. You won't be able to sleep.

595
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,960
I'm not angry.

596
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,960
I'm afraid that no one will send you bentang from now on.

597
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,960
I'm sorry.

598
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,960
I sent this to you.

599
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,960
But now I'm going to take it back.

600
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,960
I'll just keep it as it is.

601
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,960
I'll keep it as it is.

602
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,960
Tui.

603
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,620
Tui, where is

604
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,960
Uncle Tui cooking for you.

605
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,960
He has a piece of board.

606
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,960
He's been talking about you for a long time.

607
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,960
Look at you.

608
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,960
You're so innocent.

609
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,960
He's even got a sense of honor.

610
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:18,960
You finally got rid of me.

611
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,960
You'll never love me again.

612
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,960
I hope you'll be a good husband.

613
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,960
I'm so proud of you.

614
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:26,960
Tianran!

615
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,960
You're so kind.

616
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,960
You're the one who brought me here.

617
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,960
No, I'm not.

618
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,960
Please forgive me.

619
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,960
You're a bastard.

620
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,960
Get out of here.

621
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,960
Get out of here.

622
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,960
Get out of here.

623
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,960
Get out of here.

624
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:37,960
I...

625
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:38,960
What's wrong?

626
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,960
I don't want to see you again.

627
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:44,960
Look at you.

628
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,960
What?

629
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,960
You can't go home.

630
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,960
What are you looking at?

631
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,960
Brother Tuo,

632
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,960
my father is calling you.

633
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,960
Wait for me to come home.

634
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,960
Why are you running away with him?

635
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,960
I'm waiting for you.

636
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,960
Look at you.

637
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,960
I don't know what to tell you.

638
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,960
You're not a kid.

639
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,960
Brother Tuo,

640
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,960
I'm waiting for you at school.

641
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,960
Why did you give him the second cow

642
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:17,960
that you want to take care of?

643
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,960
I'm so disappointed in you.

644
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,960
I won't be leaving you again.

645
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,960
You're so stupid.

646
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,960
I told you he's a bastard.

647
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:26,960
You're a bastard.

648
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,960
I'm sorry.

649
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,960
He's not a kid.

650
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,960
He's a kid.

651
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,960
He's not a kid.

652
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,960
He's a bastard.

653
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,960
Are you a bastard?

654
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:39,960
Or a coward?

655
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,960
You're a coward.

656
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,960
Look at you.

657
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,960
He's a kid.

658
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,960
You're a coward.

659
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,960
I'm a coward.

660
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,960
You're a coward.

661
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,960
You're a coward.

662
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,960
You're a coward.

663
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,960
You're a coward.

664
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,960
You're a coward.

665
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,960
I can't.

666
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,960
If you want to do it go ahead.

667
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,960
I'm sorry.

668
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,960
Fine, I'll help you back up.

669
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,960
I'll think twice before doing it.

670
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,960
Fine, I'll help you.

671
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,960
Consider yourself aand what you're going through there.

672
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,960
As long as you keep your mouth shut,

673
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,960
I'll show them that you're a coward.

674
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,960
You lot, just go ahead.

675
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,960
Keep away from us.

676
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,960
I'm going to Xiao Le.

677
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,960
I can do it.

678
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,960
Xiao Le.

679
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,960
Xiao Le.

680
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,960
Xiao Le.

681
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,960
Xiao Le.

682
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,960
Xiao Le.

683
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,960
Xiao Le, I'm not seeing you.

684
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,960
Xiao Le, I'm not seeing you.

685
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,960
Xiao Le.

686
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,960
Why is there a kid?

687
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,960
Ding Zhe. Ding Zhe. Ding Zhe.

688
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,960
Ding Zhe.

689
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,960
Little kid, what are you looking at?

690
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,960
I'm looking here.

691
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:09,960
Taipei.

692
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,960
You're going to a place that's so far away.

693
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:12,960
No, no.

694
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,960
You're alone.

695
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,960
Where's the money?

696
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,960
It's not a question of money.

697
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,960
I can't go to a place that's so far away

698
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,960
with such a small kid like you.

699
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,960
You...

700
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,960
You're not going to leave home, are you?

701
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,960
Where's your parents?

702
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,960
I'm going to find my relatives.

703
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,960
Actually, I like to call them my family members.

704
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,960
But I can't find them at the same time.

705
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,960
What family members?

706
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,960
Little kid, you can't run around like this.

707
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,960
I'll take you to the police station.

708
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,960
No, no.

709
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,960
I have to find him.

710
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,960
Or he'll forget me.

711
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,960
What?

712
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,960
I can't say.

713
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,960
He's not around me now.

714
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,960
But as long as I listen to my heart,

715
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,960
he'll think of me.

716
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,960
But I can't talk to him.

717
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,960
Yes.

718
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,960
It's not enough to meet him.

719
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,960
So you're a couple now.

720
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,960
Poor little kid.

721
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,960
And you're looking for your relatives.

722
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,960
It's okay.

723
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,960
I'll take you to your dad.

724
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,960
Yes.

725
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,960
Sit down.

726
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:50,960
Live in the same place as before.

727
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:55,960
If spending time has one leader,

728
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:01,960
I think we lost the chance.

729
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:06,960
If we're talking aboutênciaênciaqua buffs,

730
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,960
or 기다� Meanwhile the desire is here.

731
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,960
We'll go to the temple and pray for the temple to be built

732
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,960
The temple is a small temple, but it's a small temple

733
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:21,960
We'll go to the temple and pray for the temple to be built

734
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,960
Let's go!

735
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,960
Xiaolong!

736
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:29,960
Where are you?

737
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:30,960
Xiaolong!

738
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,960
Xiaolong!

739
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,960
Xiaolong!

740
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,960
Where are you?

741
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,960
Don't go to school with me today. No one is at school

742
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:50,960
Where are you going?

743
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,960
Tell me where are you going?

744
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,960
Don't worry, Mu Chen. The village head is in a hurry

745
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,960
He'll help you find him

746
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,960
Let's go to the temple and find him

747
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,960
Let's go

748
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:06,960
Xiaolong!

749
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,960
Xiaolong, look at the gold. It's a beautiful place

750
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,960
It's a small temple and you can't go to school

751
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,960
It's a small temple

752
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,960
You can't go to school

753
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,960
You can't go to school. You'll be in trouble

754
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:23,960
You can't go to school. You'll be in trouble

755
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,960
Xiaolong, look at the gold

756
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,960
You don't know me? I'm a cook

757
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,960
Xiaolong, I'll tell you when you get out

758
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,960
You'll be in trouble if you don't go to school

759
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,960
Xiaolong!

760
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,960
Liang Xiaolong!

761
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,960
Xiaolong!

762
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,960
Where are you?

763
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,960
Xiaolong!

764
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,960
I've looked everywhere

765
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,960
Xiaolong, where are you?

766
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,960
Where are you?

767
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,960
Xiaolong!

768
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,960
What a beautiful bracelet!

769
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,960
Do you remember the foreign-born dad gave it to you?

770
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,960
This is our bracelet. It's a wedding dress

771
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,960
Xiaolong, look at this

772
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:50,960
Be careful

773
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,960
Don't take it off. It's too big

774
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,960
No, it's too big

775
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,960
It's too big

776
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,960
It's too big

777
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:00,960
It's too big

778
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,960
It's too big

779
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,960
I've been in trouble. I'm afraid of the people

780
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,960
They're all drunk. They don't know how to do it

781
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,960
I'm drunk. I'm drunk

782
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,960
But Xiaolong is not. I'm so happy

783
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,960
I don't know if I can go to school or not

784
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,960
I don't know

785
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,960
Xiaolong was in a relationship with me yesterday

786
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,960
I read a few lines

787
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:24,960
He met a bad guy

788
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,960
He took him away

789
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,960
No, no, no

790
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,960
You're not afraid of that guy

791
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,960
Xiaolong is a good boy. He's a good boy

792
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,960
He's a good boy

793
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,960
He's not afraid of the bad guy

794
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,960
I'm afraid of the bad guy

795
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,960
Xiaolong's mom

796
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:46,960
Taotao

797
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:48,960
What's up?

798
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,960
I know where Xiaolong is

799
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:53,960
Where is he?

800
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,960
He's in Taipei to find a lawyer

801
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:58,960
Daibao

802
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:00,960
Taotao

803
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,960
Did he call me not to talk?

804
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:11,960
Let's go to Taipei

805
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,960
Taipei

806
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,960
Little friend, we're here

807
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,960
Don't buy it. It's not expensive

808
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:36,960
Take it

809
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,960
The driver will come here for you

810
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,960
He can take you to your dad's place

811
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,960
Daibao

812
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:45,960
Daibao

813
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:47,960
Daibao

814
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,960
I want to pick you up

815
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:50,960
But...

816
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:53,960
Okay

817
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,960
But you may...

818
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,960
I have a plan

819
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:00,960
I'm okay

820
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,960
Bye, uncle Xie

821
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:03,960
Take care of yourself

822
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:04,960
Bye

823
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:05,960
No

824
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,960
Okay, I'll pick you up

825
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,960
Okay, bye

826
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:10,960
Bye

827
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,960
I'm done with your stuff

828
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,960
Wait

829
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:16,960
Wait

830
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,960
Okay, I'll pick you up

831
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:30,960
Okay

832
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:31,960
Uncle Xie

833
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:32,960
Uncle Xie

834
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:33,960
Uncle Xie

835
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:34,960
Uncle Xie

836
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:35,960
Uncle Xie

837
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:36,960
Uncle Xie

838
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:37,960
Uncle Xie

839
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:38,960
Uncle Xie

840
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:39,960
Uncle Xie

841
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:43,960
Uncle Xie

842
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:54,960
Here you are

843
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:56,960
Thank you

844
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:57,960
You're welcome

845
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:58,960
Take care

846
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,960
Hello, A-Chen

847
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,960
I have a baby

848
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:12,960
I have a baby

849
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:13,960
I have a baby

850
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,960
I have a baby

851
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,960
Actually, the wedding is like a movie

852
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,960
The script can take the most important scene

853
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,960
The hotel has 8m of space

854
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,960
And a wooden lantern

855
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,960
The best condition

856
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:28,960
Is to let the two of you

857
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,960
The most beautiful scene

858
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,960
I bought a long one

859
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,960
Don't let me fall

860
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:39,960
Uncle Xie

861
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,960
I'll hold you

862
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,960
I won't let you fall

863
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:47,960
What's wrong?

864
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,960
You look like you're in a movie

865
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,960
I don't know

866
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:52,960
I keep jumping

867
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,960
Maybe I'm a little tired after coming back

868
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:10,960
Hello, Mu Chen

869
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:13,960
Xiao Le is missing

870
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,960
He didn't come to me

871
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,960
How could this happen?

872
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,960
He might have gone to you

873
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,960
He didn't come to you

874
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,960
He was scolded by me

875
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,960
I didn't mean to hurt his feelings

876
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,960
I'm sorry

877
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:28,960
Don't blame yourself

878
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:29,960
Don't be angry

879
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,960
I'm going back to my office

880
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,960
Maybe he'll wait for me there

881
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,960
I'm on my way with Tu Reijin

882
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,960
He hasn't come to me yet

883
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,960
If I can't make it, please let me go

884
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,960
I'll go get him

885
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:52,960
What's the matter?

886
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,960
Xiao Le is missing

887
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,960
Have you seen a 5-year-old girl called Xiao Le?

888
00:56:58,960 --> 00:56:59,960
No

889
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,960
You go to the lobby and see what she says

890
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,960
I'll go with you to see Xiao Le

891
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,960
You'd better go to the hospital

892
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,960
I'll go by myself

893
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,960
What's going on?

894
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,960
Miss, this way

895
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,960
What's wrong?

896
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,960
You've gone so far to return my things

897
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:39,960
Thank you

898
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,960
I'm fine. I'm going to the 5th floor

899
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:46,960
I'll be even happier if I help others

900
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,960
Xiao Le, I don't want to go back

901
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,960
It's okay. I know where you just came from

902
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,960
I'll take you there. Follow me

903
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:58,960
Come

904
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,960
Hurry up. It's a precious time

905
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,960
I'm a little late

906
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,960
Here you are

907
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,960
Here you are

908
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:43,960
Thank you

909
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,960
Are you happy, honey?

910
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,960
Of course

911
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,960
My clothes are dirty

912
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,960
My grandma looks like you. You're so pretty

913
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,960
You're so young. You don't know what's beautiful

914
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:07,960
I know. I have a lot of grandmothers. They're different

915
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,960
You're called Xiao Le

916
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,960
Do you like the air-conditioning?

917
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:22,960
I do

918
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,960
I'm home

919
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,960
I'm home. I'll be right there

920
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:34,960
My grandma takes you there. Hurry up

921
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:36,960
Hurry up

922
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,960
I can't believe you fell down

923
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,960
Xiao Le, what's wrong?

924
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:03,960
It's snowing again

925
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,960
Chen! Come over here!

926
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:08,960
Chen!

927
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,960
Go to the previous hospital

928
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:19,960
Hurry up

929
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,960
Have you seen Xiao Le?

930
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:25,960
Look at this green thing. It's not on the spot

931
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,960
Is there a street dog that wants to come to see me?

932
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,960
There's a kid who's asking about the sports

933
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,960
But he didn't say he wanted to see the lawyer

934
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:37,960
Go

935
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,960
Xiao Le, have you found him?

936
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:52,960
Have you?

937
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,960
Yes. Is that kid a kid?

938
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:57,960
Xiao Le

939
01:01:58,960 --> 01:01:59,960
Xiao Le

940
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,960
I've been to the evidence office. But I don't understand

941
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:03,960
Why did he leave?

942
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,960
He should have been in the car

943
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,960
He might be in the car at any time

944
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,960
Don't worry. He's still nearby. We'll find him

945
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,960
No, the car is faster. Take a look at his photo

946
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:15,960
Meitai

947
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:17,960
I have

948
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,960
Look, don't be afraid

949
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,960
We'll find him. Don't worry

950
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:36,960
Be strong

951
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:45,960
Xiao Le

952
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:55,960
Yijian

953
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:56,960
Hurry up

954
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:57,960
Xiao Le

955
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,960
You're really this kid?

956
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:01,960
Mom, we'll talk later. We need to go

957
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:03,960
Go to the evidence office

958
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:08,960
I'm at the police station. I met her. She was in a daze

959
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,960
She was injured

960
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,960
Look at this

961
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:16,960
I'm not well. I didn't notice her hand

962
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,960
Get ready to write and prepare for surgery

963
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,960
Help me to take the surgery

964
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:29,960
I'll give you the procedure

965
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:30,960
I'll go to the police station

966
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:42,960
Xiao Le

967
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:46,960
Xiao Le

968
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:48,960
What?

969
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:49,960
Xiao Le is here

970
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:11,960
Hurry up

971
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,960
Xiao Le is injured. She needs to write and prepare for surgery

972
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,960
I need to ask Miss Wang

973
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,960
to send the medical records to the evidence office

974
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,960
Okay, Yijian. She's nearby

975
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:26,960
Hello, Ms. Huai

976
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,960
How is Xiao Le?

977
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:30,960
Her ID is

978
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:35,960
K165702 418

979
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,960
Don't worry, Miss Wang. Xiao Le will be fine

980
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,960
Hurry up and come to the hospital

981
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:48,960
Okay, thank you, Miss Wang

982
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:49,960
Thank you

983
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:51,960
We'll go to the hospital now

984
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,960
Don't worry, Yijian is here. She'll be fine

985
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,960
We'll go to the hospital now. We'll see Xiao Le

986
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,960
Xiao Le

987
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,960
What a cute child

988
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,960
I hope she's fine

989
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:35,960
Miss Wang

990
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,960
Please take the surgery room

991
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,960
Yes, I'll go to the hospital

992
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:41,960
Mom

993
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:44,960
What's wrong?

994
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,960
Do you know each other?

995
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,960
No

996
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,960
Do you know each other?

997
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,960
We know each other. President Fang

998
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:46,960
Don't you forget that you've studied in the university?

999
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:53,960
I sent Xiao Le to the hospital

1000
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,960
Xiao Le helped me pick up things

1001
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,960
He followed me all the way

1002
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,960
I was right next to him when something happened

1003
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:04,960
That's...

1004
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:05,960
What's wrong?

1005
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:12,960
This is Xiao Le's mother, Yang Mu Chen

1006
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,960
I stayed at her house when I was in Hua Tian Village

1007
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:19,960
How is Xiao Le? Is she serious?

1008
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,960
I don't know yet

1009
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,960
I don't know if Xiao Le is ill

1010
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:32,960
I'm sorry that I didn't come here to stop her

1011
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,960
I'm sorry

1012
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:45,960
How is Xiao Le?

1013
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:47,960
We've cleaned up the wound

1014
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,960
The doctor is doing a painkiller surgery

1015
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,960
The situation is stable

1016
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,960
Miss Wang, please come with me

1017
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:00,960
Here's a form of a scar. Please take it

1018
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:01,960
Xiao Le has a blood type B

1019
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,960
But we don't have enough blood

1020
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,960
We might need to take it to the hospital

1021
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:07,960
I'm a blood type O. I can take it to Xiao Le

1022
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,960
Blood type B can't be taken to the child

1023
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,960
Although most people don't know about this principle

1024
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:16,960
There may be complications or complications

1025
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,960
Xiao Le is the first blood sugar patient

1026
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:19,960
Be careful

1027
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,960
Blood type B can't be taken to the child

1028
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:25,960
Who are you to ask for blood type B?

1029
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:26,960
I'm a blood type O. I can...

1030
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:27,960
Don't worry. He can't...

1031
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:33,960
Blood type B?

1032
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,960
I'm blood type B. Why can't I?

1033
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,960
I'm more suitable for blood type B

1034
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:39,960
Give me a reason

1035
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,960
I used to be a blood type O. I'm a blood type O

1036
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:22,960
fascinating

1037
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:23,960
congratulations

1038
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:29,960
Last check for the foundation

1039
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:33,120
Wait for class 3 later.

1040
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:37,120
Come on.

1041
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:38,880
Miss éa.

1042
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:42,420
sane she asked you guys to...

1043
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,920
fox

1044
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:24,720
In the beginning

1045
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:27,440
they were budgetate

1046
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,480
They had the full probability of error

1047
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,960
What if you tell him?

1048
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:35,560
He will only let you have everything.

1049
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:38,260
How could I have the chance to take this secret to get married with him?

1050
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:40,360
Don't you think you're too selfish?

1051
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:42,760
Ma Shi, I've never asked anyone.

1052
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:44,960
What happened to me?

1053
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,060
It's a Pandora box.

1054
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:49,860
I don't know if it's good or bad.

1055
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:51,760
But I can confirm that

1056
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,760
I've changed a lot of things now.

1057
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:56,760
Including you, the person who is very important to you.

1058
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,760
He knows.

1059
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:01,760
He knows that we've changed him.

1060
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:05,360
I won't marry you.

1061
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,560
He didn't tell me that

1062
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,060
Xiao Le is my child.

1063
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:10,060
I want that child.

1064
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:13,660
Congratulations.

1065
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:15,660
How could you do that?

1066
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:17,560
Do you think he's betrayed you?

1067
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:20,660
Or because you still love him?

1068
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,560
Why do you always care about his feelings?

1069
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:25,960
He's a good guy.

1070
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:28,460
He's the one who's always been a good guy.

1071
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:30,360
He's always been a good guy.

1072
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:32,960
He's always been a good guy.

1073
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,660
I never knew you were so good.

1074
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:37,060
I'm sorry.

1075
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:38,460
I'm just curious.

1076
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:40,460
I'll tell you later.

1077
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:42,860
Why do you have to tell me sorry?

1078
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:45,160
Do I still have feelings for you?

1079
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:47,960
Or are you a good guy?

1080
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:49,960
Don't be mad at me.

1081
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:56,960
I'm sorry.

1082
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,660
I'm sorry.

1083
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:00,160
I'm sorry.

1084
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:01,860
I'm sorry.

1085
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:03,760
I'm sorry.

1086
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,360
I'm sorry.

1087
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,160
I'm sorry.

1088
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:08,960
I'm sorry.

1089
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,760
I'm sorry.

1090
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,360
I'm sorry.

1091
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,360
I'm sorry.

1092
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:15,960
I'm sorry.

1093
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,760
I'm sorry.

1094
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,760
I'm sorry.

1095
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:21,760
I'm sorry.

1096
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,760
I'm sorry.

1097
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,960
I'm sorry.

1098
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:29,260
I suddenly realized

1099
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:34,160
that love is not what you think.

1100
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:35,760
I'm sorry.

1101
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,960
I'm sorry.

1102
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:41,160
I'm sorry.

1103
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:46,960
I'm sorry.

1104
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:52,160
I'm sorry.

1105
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:55,760
Let's open our eyes.

1106
01:12:55,760 --> 01:13:00,560
I can see that you're looking forward to it.

1107
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,960
You always come up and love me.

1108
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:07,760
Why are you in my mind?

1109
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:13,560
I should have been like this.
