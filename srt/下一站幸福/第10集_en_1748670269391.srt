1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Next, we will broadcast for you the next happy moment

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You should say that

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I am the only one who can come to my mind in the next 6 years

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If we really know each other, I will never forget it

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Please don't mind me

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Please don't treat him like this anymore

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Your consciousness and heart will only make him more painful

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You will never become his father

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If you don't come to my father, you will have to give me candy

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Tata, don't be afraid

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
My grandma will come

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I really want to be your friend

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Why don't you divorce me?

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Don't forget that you and your previous wedding are broken

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You should try your best

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And let that innocent village people get the money

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Don't worry about those pessimistic thoughts

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Follow our efforts

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
There are so many places you don't go

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I don't want to be taken to Hua Tian Village

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I think that's not a coincidence

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I should have some special speciality

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
First time?

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
After I came here, your first time was a joke

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You should laugh at me like this

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Don't make me feel bad

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I feel better after work

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll call your mom

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The first day

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The most important mess

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Tata, I'll have dinner

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Enjoy your meal

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's delicious

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Thank you, grandma

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Tata, don't be my girlfriend

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I can't marry you

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But I don't want to be your girlfriend

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Tata, don't be afraid

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'll come tomorrow to take you to the public

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
My dad said that person is a lawyer

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
He's not your dad

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Your mom is a mess

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So your dad wants you

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You're a mess

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm not a mess

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Your mom is a mess

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You're lying to your dad

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You're so stupid

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You can't be my mom

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It hurts

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm going to tell my dad

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It hurts

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm going to tell my dad

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
He's crying

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What's wrong?

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Tell Mu Chen

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He's so bad

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He said Mu Chen is a bad guy

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What did he say?

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He said Mu Chen is a mess

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
He didn't have a dad

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He was angry

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I hit him and then he ran back

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I believe that he didn't mean to say Mu Chen

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But you're not right

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You can't bite him

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Let's go to the public tomorrow

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
No

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I hate to say that

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
He eats every day

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He didn't hit me

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I want to grow up soon

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Mu Chen

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Mu Chen is fine

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
He's fine

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Who said he's fine?

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I don't think so

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Mu Chen

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You are fine

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Xiaole, do you know who is the third uncle's husband?

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I know.

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Come on, don't cry.

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Do you know that the third uncle's husband is just like the flower bud when he was a kid?

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This is a favorite of Chaoxiaobian.

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
She used to bully children's children.

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
One day, all the children in the second grade didn't want to play with her.

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
She didn't know why.

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
She went to ask Xiaole.

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
She said,

90
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Because you bully me, I don't want to play with you.

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
After the third uncle heard it,

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
he was so sad.

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
He decided to be a good kid from then on.

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He said sorry to all the children.

95
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He even gave the children a kiss.

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
In the end, the children forgave him.

97
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But every year, he only sends gifts to good kids.

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I hope those who don't receive gifts can face his own mistakes.

99
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Don't make mistakes.

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You can still get gifts next year.

101
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So what does this story tell us?

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Welcome to the third uncle's house.

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yes.

104
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But the main thing is to tell Xiaole.

105
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The wrong thing should be like a man.

106
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's true to face the truth.

107
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Even if a bad kid bullies you,

108
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
you can't hide.

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You should be like a man.

110
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Be brave and brave.

111
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Because the husband knows good kids and bad kids.

112
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
He will be a big mess on the head of the bad kids.

113
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Like a man.

114
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yes, like a man.

115
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Xiaole is a man, right?

116
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yes.

117
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Really?

118
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yes.

119
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Really?

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yes.

121
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Then how do you prove it to me?

122
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Mu Ze, I still want to protect you.

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm sorry for the bad kids and the teacher.

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I hate to be so ridiculous.

125
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Xiaole is great.

126
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
She knows her own mistakes.

127
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The husband will give you a big gift this year.

128
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm Xiaole.

129
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Uncle Han, Xiaole knows to stop him.

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And you, as a mother,

131
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
you should apologize to the child's sister.

132
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The child will only be a coward.

133
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Actually, the story of the husband is told to you.

134
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You have a big mess on your head.

135
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Mu Ze, you are so tall.

136
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You have a big mess.

137
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Xiaole, you dare to laugh at me?

138
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You have a big mess on your head.

139
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You are so mean.

140
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You are so mean.

141
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You are so mean.

142
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You are so mean.

143
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm not mean.

144
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Bye.

145
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Mu Ze, I'm so happy to see you smile.

146
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm so sorry to bother you.

147
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You are like family.

148
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Don't make fun of me.

149
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You sit here.

150
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Thank you.

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
How come you come here?

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I want to give this to you.

153
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Thank you for giving me a gift.

154
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I don't know if it's good or bad.

155
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I want to see his marriage.

156
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But I'm sincere.

157
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Thank you for giving me a gift.

158
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You must take it.

159
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's so precious.

160
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I can't accept it.

161
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I don't understand Chinese.

162
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You should take it back.

163
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Lawyer Ren, this is the treasure that Caibei kept in his life.

164
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's precious.

165
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Take it back.

166
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You take it back.

167
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Take it back.

168
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Thank you.

169
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Brother, come on.

170
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Sit down.

171
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Li Jie.

172
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Be careful.

173
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Caibei, your feet are getting worse.

174
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I can't stand it.

175
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I can't stand it anymore.

176
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I can't stand it anymore.

177
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Wait for me.

178
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Caibei, I'll help you.

179
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You are so mean.

180
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Of course.

181
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'll help you.

182
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's been a long time since I changed my medicine.

183
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's time to change.

184
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Or it will get worse.

185
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Okay.

186
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's so heavy.

187
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Come on.

188
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Put your feet in.

189
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Is the water temperature okay?

190
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Is it too hot?

191
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's okay.

192
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's okay.

193
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Why did you kill my black借客?

194
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You are the one who killed him.

195
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Come with me.

196
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
The jade box can't be planted in a place where there is no water or grass.

197
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Like this one.

198
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
There are chicken feet,

199
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
steamed pork feet,

200
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
and the food.

201
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The mud that is combined with the food.

202
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's very beneficial.

203
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Here.

204
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'll give you a tip.

205
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Put it in the bottom.

206
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The soil will cover the whole ball.

207
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But the top part needs to be leaked.

208
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Like this.

209
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You put it in a ventilation place.

210
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And water it in three days.

211
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
When it's ready,

212
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
you can take it out and dry it.

213
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You can only water it in two days.

214
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Here.

215
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I forgot to put it on you.

216
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You smile.

217
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You look good.

218
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Even if you are afraid of the deep,

219
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
but have experienced the contact these days,

220
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
we can be friends.

221
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm sorry.

222
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm sorry.

223
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
She's gone.

224
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,380
No, Mommy, we're both LU!

225
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,440
Don't call me that.

226
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,100
Where is Shadow Daer Van?

227
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,420
Oh, hi there.

228
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,420
I'm the same.

229
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,420
I'm so bad at it.

230
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,420
I'm sorry.

231
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,420
It's okay.

232
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:51,420
At least I know that he's been doing well these years.

233
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,420
To me, it's enough.

234
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,420
I'm sorry.

235
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,420
Do you hate him?

236
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,420
We were happy once.

237
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,420
We were happy.

238
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:25,420
I didn't regret meeting him or loving him.

239
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:30,420
We were separated because of the pain.

240
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,420
But at that time,

241
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,420
this decision was the best for us.

242
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:48,420
Later, I knew that his life

243
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:53,420
was better without me and Xiaole's signing.

244
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:59,420
I found happiness here.

245
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,420
I really hope he can be happy.

246
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:11,420
This is also the last blessing I can give him.

247
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:19,420
Because I know that his life is better without me.

248
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,420
I'm the same.

249
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:36,420
Actually, I always want to be his face.

250
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,420
Thank him.

251
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,420
I want to tell him

252
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,420
Thank you.

253
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,420
Thank you for giving me a chance.

254
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:59,420
This child is the best gift in my life.

255
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,420
I'm sorry.

256
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,420
I'm sorry.

257
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,420
I'm sorry.

258
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,420
I'm sorry.

259
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,420
I'm sorry.

260
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,420
I'm sorry.

261
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,420
I'm sorry.

262
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,420
I'm sorry.

263
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,420
I'm sorry.

264
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,420
I'm sorry.

265
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,420
I'm sorry.

266
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,420
I'm sorry.

267
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,420
I'm sorry.

268
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,420
I'm sorry.

269
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,420
I'm sorry.

270
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,420
It's my relationship.

271
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,420
I'm sorry.

272
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,420
What are you doing?

273
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,420
Mu Chen, what's wrong?

274
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,420
I have a dirty hair.

275
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,420
Dirty hair?

276
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,420
Okay, don't be afraid.

277
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,420
Mu Chen is playing dirty.

278
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,420
Don't be afraid, Mu Chen is here.

279
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,420
The boss is dead.

280
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,420
Didn't you say you want to be a man?

281
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,420
So I can't be afraid of the boss?

282
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,420
Okay, you have to go to bed early.

283
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,420
Mu Chen will accompany you to the family ceremony tomorrow.

284
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,420
Mu Chen is the best.

285
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,420
He will be the father of Xiao Le tomorrow.

286
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,420
You have to be the father of my mother.

287
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,420
Xiao Le, Guangxi Shu has taken care of you.

288
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,420
He has to face himself in the city.

289
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:33,420
Guangxi Shu Shu can be Xiao Le's good friend.

290
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,420
But he is not Xiao Le's father.

291
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:44,420
So you have to be a man.

292
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,420
Just put her down.

293
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,540
As for Xiao Le,

294
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,420
what is His Majesty's plan to presidents Dong'er?

295
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,420
We don't know.

296
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,420
He is always very во anti-s chilling.

297
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,420
我想.

298
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,420
Are you going to keep it for computation?

299
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,420
Ok, okay.

300
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,420
Xiao Le will play dirty.

301
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,880
You...

302
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm just a technical resident web seller for Wan Tong

303
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,260
Voice스틱

304
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,320
Hurry!

305
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,680
Don't move.

306
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,920
My first day of coming here was washed by villagers

307
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,160
Their cases are so strange

308
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,860
calling for母亲 and sharing counsel

309
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,660
they did strange things

310
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,660
But I know why he hates me so much when I'm here

311
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,660
He doesn't want me to eat with them

312
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,660
But he has a 5 year old son

313
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,660
He thinks I'm his father who came to the planet

314
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,660
Dad

315
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,660
This is your first time to mention my son

316
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,660
It seems he's special to you

317
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,660
You should come here to see

318
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,660
This place will make you want to take a slow step

319
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,660
But you can't take it any longer

320
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,660
Dad is very jealous of the earth

321
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,660
I want you to come back soon

322
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,660
Don't worry

323
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,660
I'll pay you back in half a week

324
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,660
I'll wait for you to sleep

325
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,660
It's late. Go to bed

326
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,660
The next day

327
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:28,660
Everyone, the time for the final round is only half an hour

328
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,660
Please give us the time to practice

329
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,660
Thank you

330
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,660
I'm so tired

331
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,660
I know what you're thinking

332
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,660
You can't take it back at all

333
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
You're so smart

334
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,660
You'll be back soon

335
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,660
You still have time to practice

336
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,660
I'll wait for you

337
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,660
Everyone is having fun

338
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,660
Even the hot electric train is still playing

339
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,660
And it's still very hot

340
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,660
I'm a boy

341
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,660
I'm a boy

342
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,660
I'm a boy

343
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,660
It's too late

344
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,660
It's so hot in the weather now

345
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,660
It's because there's a hot weather

346
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,660
I'll be back in a few days

347
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,660
By the time I get this warm card

348
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,660
I'll give you a warm card

349
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,660
So I'll teach you how to bring this to you

350
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,660
How to bring warm cards to your favorite person

351
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,660
Liang Xiaole, you always do this

352
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,660
You're just like your family

353
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,660
You're so far away from me

354
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,660
How can I be with you?

355
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,660
You're just like a stranger

356
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,660
He's not your stranger

357
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,660
Don't bother him

358
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,660
You can hang things or cook

359
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,660
I'm done

360
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,660
Liang Xiaole

361
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,660
Your mom is with you again

362
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,660
Where's your father?

363
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,660
No one's here

364
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,660
I knew it

365
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,660
You lost

366
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,660
Who said that?

367
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,660
My dad will be here soon

368
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,660
I'm done

369
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,660
I'm done

370
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:40,660
You're just like a stranger

371
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,660
Don't bother him

372
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,660
You can hang things or cook

373
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,660
I'm done

374
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,660
You can hang things or cook

375
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,660
I'm done

376
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,660
I'm done

377
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,660
Liang Xiaole

378
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,660
Your mom is with you again

379
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,660
Where's your father?

380
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,660
I want to call him to stop bothering me

381
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,660
Miso Miso

382
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,660
I'm going to take you to the hospital

383
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,660
I'm going to take you to the hospital

384
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,660
Miso Miso

385
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,660
You continue to pretend

386
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,660
Anyway, today you are going to lose again

387
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,660
Tang Tang, you are going to be my girlfriend

388
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,660
I'm going to show her the way to the building

389
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:28,660
Where is Tang Tang? Why isn't he here yet?

390
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,660
I'm going to the hospital

391
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,660
The building

392
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,660
Miso

393
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,660
Miso

394
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,660
Are you a kid's classmate?

395
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,660
You didn't go to class?

396
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,660
You can't just come and press the bell

397
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,660
My dad said he would ask you to help him

398
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:31,660
He can help you to stay here for 240 hours

399
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,660
Are you going to find my parents?

400
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,660
You want to find my parents?

401
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,660
Miso is very busy

402
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,660
But he is my teacher

403
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,660
He can help me

404
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,660
Miso is engaged

405
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,660
You are a little late

406
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,660
If you find him 20 years later, maybe he will have a chance

407
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,660
I'm not going to marry you

408
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,660
My dad is a kid

409
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,660
But he said to the teacher

410
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,660
His father-in-law

411
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,660
He will go to the hospital today

412
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,660
If he loses, I will marry him

413
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,660
I can only do this

414
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,660
Me?

415
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,660
Yes, you can see

416
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,660
We are going to marry Mora

417
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,660
Let's hear her amazing Lala's performance

418
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:53,660
Now, we will invite Hua Hong

419
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:57,660
to bring her amazing flower-shaped judo

420
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,660
Let's welcome them

421
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:23,660
Let's welcome him

422
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,660
Hua Hong

423
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:30,660
theمر

424
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,660
So let me say

425
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:37,660
Since we're here to eat

426
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:41,660
we have to use punching

427
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,660
Communication

428
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:48,660
photograph

429
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,660
Hmph!

430
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,560
I, to my perfect buddy

431
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,660
separatingake KTし

432
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,660
Because when you get out of the car,

433
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,060
the door has a car

434
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,760
and you hit the car

435
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,360
and you hit the car

436
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,160
So

437
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,560
you are called

438
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,760
Hua Hong

439
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,160
I'm going to use

440
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,260
a big car

441
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,260
a new car

442
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,260
to drive you out of the car

443
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,760
Come a bit, don't look

444
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,860
Don't look

445
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,060
Why are you looking

446
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,960
You are Klatt

447
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,060
Xiao Le

448
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,660
We come up here

449
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,960
because we came first

450
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,460
and we have to tell them

451
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,160
why don't these girls save Xiao Le

452
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,360
I promise

453
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,160
Come on

454
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,660
I want to eat my chicken feet

455
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,660
I won

456
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,660
Cha Cha

457
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,660
Cha Cha, why are you here now?

458
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:13,660
Have you seen me look so cute?

459
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,660
It's cold

460
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,660
I'm done acting

461
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,660
It's your turn to act

462
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,660
Why are you so full?

463
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,660
Xiaole, you and your mom are not done yet

464
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,660
Let's help Xiaole to take a photo

465
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,660
Welcome her and her mom to the stage

466
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,660
Xiaole, you lost

467
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:48,660
Your baby is gone

468
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,660
I won't play with you anymore

469
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,660
I told you

470
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,660
She will come back soon

471
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,660
What do you mean?

472
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,660
She won't come back

473
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,660
You don't have a baby

474
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,660
Xiaole

475
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,660
You're done with my baby

476
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:13,660
I can't take it anymore

477
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,660
Xiaole

478
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,660
Xiaole

479
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,660
I won't play with you anymore

480
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,660
I won't play with you anymore

481
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,660
Xiaole

482
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,660
Miss Chu

483
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,660
Sorry, I'm late

484
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,660
Daddy, you're here

485
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,660
I'm here

486
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,660
This is Xiaole's biggest wish

487
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:31,660
She always wants her dad to come to pick her up

488
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,660
She even made a phone call

489
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,660
She really wants her dad to be her dad

490
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,660
She really wants her dad to be her dad

491
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,660
Xiaole, don't worry

492
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,660
Xiaole, give me a hug

493
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:50,660
Teacher said that when the time comes, the dream will become true

494
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,660
It's called miracle

495
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:59,660
Okay, let's make it a miracle day

496
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,660
Daddy prepared the same thing

497
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,660
We need to finish it together

498
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,660
When we meet someone who's bullied by us, we'll know

499
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,660
Daddy, fly

500
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,660
Daddy, I'll teach you

501
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,660
Okay

502
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,660
What are you doing in the big city? When did you become Xiaole's dad?

503
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,660
Xiaole always wants to come to pick her up

504
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:33,660
I'm very grateful to her

505
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,660
I hope we can all make it a miracle day together

506
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,660
Xiaole, you're so handsome

507
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:50,660
Of course, I'm not handsome

508
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,660
Xiaole, you're so handsome

509
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:11,660
Of course, I'm not handsome

510
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,660
Come on, Xiaole

511
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,660
How can I be your dad?

512
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,660
Thank you

513
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,660
Thank you

514
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:49,660
There's a sweet and good daddy

515
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,660
Xiaole

516
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,660
I'm sorry to hit you

517
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,660
This bad temper is broken

518
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,660
How do you want to contact Xiaole?

519
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,660
According to the law of fairies,

520
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,660
whoever breaks it, must compensate

521
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,660
Xiaole, tell me who broke it

522
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,660
I'll help you get rid of it

523
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,660
It's not me. I didn't do it on purpose

524
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,660
I'm here to take it from you

525
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:34,660
Don't blame me for being a dad

526
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:38,660
It's a child's world, but there should be their rules

527
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,660
Ren Guangxi, I think that's enough

528
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,660
I don't want to pay for it

529
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:50,660
Xiaole, don't be afraid. Daddy will protect you

530
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,660
Uncle, thank you

531
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,660
You taught me to be honest

532
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,660
So I have to be honest

533
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,660
I know you're not my dad

534
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:01,660
I know my dad is not an alien

535
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,660
Those are all because you're afraid of my sadness and lie to me

536
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,660
Xiaole

537
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,660
Don't lie to me about the car

538
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:13,660
I know the car is my mom's car

539
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,660
I don't know where my dad is

540
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:23,660
I don't know where my dad is. Why can't you find me?

541
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,660
I want to be a person like this

542
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:30,660
I'm happy to play with you today

543
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,660
Thank you

544
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,660
Xiaole, you're so brave

545
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,660
Xiaole, you still have a mom

546
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:05,660
I'll play with you when I'm free

547
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,660
And...

548
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,660
Thank you. Let's play together

549
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:43,660
My heart is deeply hurt, but it won't be me

550
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,660
Hello

551
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,660
Hello

552
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:04,660
One, two, three, four, five, six

553
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,660
You're so cute

554
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,660
What's wrong?

555
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,660
Nothing. I'm just curious

556
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,660
Why do you want to keep your intuition?

557
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,660
I don't know. Just intuition

558
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,660
intuition?

559
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,660
Is it that simple?

560
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,660
Maybe I'm thinking

561
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:34,660
If I'm a father, what would I want to call my son?

562
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,660
I'm not a father

563
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:46,660
There was a professor who would bring his son here

564
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,660
He wanted his son to come

565
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,660
But one time, he didn't tell his son

566
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,660
He let go of his son's hand

567
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:56,660
He suddenly lost his center

568
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,660
So he fell on the ground

569
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,660
Xiaolong, slow down

570
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:06,660
To make you independent, you have to face challenges

571
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,660
It's hard to fall

572
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,660
The most important thing is to stand up

573
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,660
There's someone on the ground

574
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,660
Your mom will protect you from her

575
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,660
Great

576
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,660
Great

577
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:32,660
Mom, water, come with me

578
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,660
You haven't finished your clothes

579
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,660
You're going to be with Xiaolong

580
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,660
Why are you so stubborn?

581
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,660
I'll help you

582
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:43,660
No, I'll be back

583
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,660
I'll help you

584
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,660
I'll do it myself

585
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,660
I'll help you

586
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,660
I'll do it myself

587
00:39:53,660 --> 00:40:03,660
To be continued...

588
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,660
Tozichuan Jindong

589
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,660
Okay, let's go

590
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,660
Let's go

591
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,660
Okay, you can let go

592
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,660
I can do it myself

593
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,660
You can do it yourself

594
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,660
You're so good

595
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,660
It's okay

596
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,660
This...

597
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,660
You're so good at holding hands

598
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,660
You're so good at holding hands

599
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,660
If you let go of your hand on the ice

600
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,660
You'll be able to control your life

601
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,660
I said I'll hold your hand

602
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,660
You'll protect me

603
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:08,660
I'll do everything until the end

604
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,660
I'll do everything until the end

605
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,660
Go on

606
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,660
Go on

607
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,660
Sorry

608
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,660
Are you okay?

609
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,660
I saw you were dead

610
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,660
You're not feeling well

611
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,660
Why do you make me feel uncomfortable?

612
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,660
Because...

613
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,660
Because you said you didn't have a haircut

614
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,660
It's dark

615
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,660
I'll go get dinner

616
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,660
You guys go ahead

617
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,660
You guys go ahead

618
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,660
Go on

619
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,660
Yang Muchen

620
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,660
You're doing great at school

621
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,660
I want to give you two shots

622
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,660
But I'm not the one who's good at acting

623
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,660
It's okay, I have it

624
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,660
I say it again

625
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:18,660
It's too hot

626
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,660
I'm getting out all the potatoes

627
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:31,660
Continue

628
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:37,660
One more shot

629
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:48,540
With the help of spring

630
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:52,380
I ran through the fog midway

631
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:52,740
kahrem

632
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:53,900
....

633
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,340
Don't be silly.

634
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,780
I'm not hungry.

635
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:15,780
What are you doing?

636
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,140
Did you teach Mucai?

637
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:18,780
It's not me.

638
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:21,540
It's the gift from the husband.

639
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,740
Guan Xin, you're my gradually idol.

640
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,260
Why do you

641
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:51,860
You can't even look at your eyes.

642
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,360
Didn't you get tired from playing all day today?

643
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,160
Are you not afraid that the time will change?

644
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,860
Xiao Le is really happy.

645
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:04,660
Xiao Le is a father.

646
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,360
Xiao Le, I'm sorry.

647
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,160
I didn't tell you the truth.

648
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:18,160
I don't know either.

649
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,260
So you know that your father is not a stranger.

650
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,760
Now, I'm telling you the story of your mother and father.

651
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,260
I don't know if it's going to be a good or bad.

652
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:37,160
That night, your father

653
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,760
forced me to play piano with him.

654
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,860
That was the first time.

655
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:46,960
I think he didn't look so annoying.

656
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,360
Xiao Le,

657
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:55,760
the young and mature Yue Zhang

658
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,360
brought us both happiness.

659
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,160
That was also the first time

660
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,360
that your mother was so moved by your father.

661
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,560
Do you know that?

662
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,160
I'm sorry.

663
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,160
I'm sorry.

664
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,160
I'm sorry.

665
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,160
I'm sorry.

666
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,160
I'm sorry.

667
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,160
I'm sorry.

668
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,160
I'm sorry.

669
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,160
I'm sorry.

670
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,160
I'm sorry.

671
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,160
I'm sorry.

672
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,160
I'm sorry.

673
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,160
I'm sorry.

674
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,160
I'm sorry.

675
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,160
I'm sorry.

676
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,160
I'm sorry.

677
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,160
Have you taken the medicine?

678
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,160
It's okay.

679
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,160
I really don't need the medicine.

680
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,160
I'm sorry.

681
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,160
I'm sorry.

682
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,160
I'm sorry.

683
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,160
I'm sorry.

684
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,160
I'm sorry.

685
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,160
I'm sorry.

686
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,160
I'm sorry.

687
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,160
I'm sorry.

688
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,160
I'm sorry.

689
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,160
I'm sorry.

690
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,160
I'm sorry.

691
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,160
I'm sorry.

692
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,160
I'm sorry.

693
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,160
I'm sorry.

694
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,160
I'm sorry.

695
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,160
I'm sorry.

696
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,160
I'm sorry.

697
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,160
I'm sorry.

698
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,160
I'm sorry.

699
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,160
I'm sorry.

700
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,160
I'm sorry.

701
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,160
I'm sorry.

702
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,160
I'm sorry.

703
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,160
Sorry.

704
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,160
Xiao Wo.

705
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,160
There's a problem with the children.

706
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:47,800
this.

707
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,260
Thank you.

708
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,160
Thank you.

709
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:22,160
Thank you for doing so much for me and my son.

710
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,160
The sky is very cold.

711
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,160
Xiao Le is very sweet.

712
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,160
And...

713
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,160
Thank you for coming to You Zhi Yuan today.

714
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,160
It's Xiao Le's biggest dream.

715
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:49,160
I've never seen her so happy.

716
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,160
So I really want to tell you...

717
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,160
Thank you.

718
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,160
Don't be so touched.

719
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,160
Why?

720
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,160
Why?

721
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,160
Why are you so good to me?

722
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,160
No, why?

723
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,160
I'm just a fool.

724
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:38,160
Since you're so good to me, you won't let go.

725
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,160
As long as I'm here, I'll take care of you.

726
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,160
I'll protect you, Xiao Le.

727
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,160
You're right.

728
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:09,160
I should do my best for you, for Xiao Le, for all the villagers.

729
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:18,160
It's Xiao Le who reminded me.

730
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,160
You should be honest.

731
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,160
Be yourself.

732
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,160
What's up? Any good news?

733
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,160
Didn't you tell me you've settled down the mess in Huatian Village?

734
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,160
I'm looking for you.

735
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,160
The place of Huatian Village...

736
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,160
He Dong.

737
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,160
I've seen the environment here.

738
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,160
I don't know if there's any investment in this place.

739
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,160
I'm looking for you.

740
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,160
I'm looking for you.

741
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,160
I've seen the environment here.

742
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,160
I don't know if there's any investment in this place.

743
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:00,160
I don't know if there's any reason to buy the place.

744
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,160
The villagers of Huatian Village live here.

745
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:08,160
Maybe He Dong, you can consider it.

746
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,160
Do you want to buy the land?

747
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,160
Other than here?

748
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,160
There's no other place to go.

749
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,160
What kind of investment do you want to make?

750
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,160
You don't need to worry about that.

751
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,160
We want to make sure the land is ours.

752
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,160
Since you're saying that,

753
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,160
I don't think you need to worry about this.

754
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,160
I'll call Xu Fang Guo to take over.

755
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,160
In any case,

756
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,160
I'll do everything I can.

757
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,160
Uncle.

758
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,160
Ranger!

759
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,160
Take action!

760
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,160
Well-done.

761
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:22,660
How is it?

762
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:23,160
Sit down.

763
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:23,660
I feel like I'm walking on the wrong path.

764
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:24,660
Sit down.

765
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:25,160
Sorry.

766
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,660
It's all my fault.

767
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:28,160
I finally got Xu Fang Guo's signature.

768
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,660
He wears our Fang Ge's old-fashioned clothes.

769
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:33,660
These are all Xu Fang Guo's clothes.

770
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:36,160
I'm lying to my brother.

771
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:36,660
I'm not lying.

772
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:38,660
You're a liar.

773
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:39,660
Don't talk.

774
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:40,660
Let's go out first.

775
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:41,660
Let's go.

776
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,660
I'm sorry.

777
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:47,660
Let's go.

778
00:54:52,160 --> 00:55:13,880
The

779
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,960
The

780
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:17,960
I'm afraid

781
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,960
I'm afraid you'll get hurt

782
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,960
I'm afraid you'll be hurt

783
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,960
I'm afraid you'll be hurt

784
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:30,960
One more time

785
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,960
One more time

786
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,960
I'm afraid you'll be hurt

787
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:38,960
I'm afraid you'll be hurt

788
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,960
I'll take a shower and get better

789
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,960
I'm afraid you'll be hurt

790
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:46,960
Hongge

791
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,960
We're all grown-ups

792
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,960
I don't want to see Chunming live without Jia

793
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:59,960
When things are over, I'll go find you a home

794
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,960
You must stay with me today

795
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,960
I'll be back

796
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,960
I'll go find you a home

797
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,960
I'll be back

798
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,960
You're so stubborn

799
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,960
You should be careful. You're a police officer

800
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,960
Stay with me. I'll take care of you

801
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,960
Jialuo, I'll take care of you

802
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,960
Don't listen to me!

803
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:35,960
I'll go and help you!

804
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,960
If we're going to return to our hometown, we'll be in a big trouble

805
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,960
We'll be in trouble

806
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:50,960
I'll take care of the house and you'll be back

807
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,960
Hongge, you said you'll take care of Jiajun

808
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,960
But you know my mom

809
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:59,960
You want her to close her shop and leave Hua Tienchun

810
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,960
And kill her

811
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,960
Look, Hua Tienchun is looking for a famous lawyer

812
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:08,960
Oh...

813
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,960
Do you dare say you'reties?

814
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:17,960
Does love have anything to do with love?

815
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:23,320
I'll tell you what if he sees you

816
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:36,960
He res Tina comes to the protest

817
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,600
I enjoy peeping out at my troubles

818
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:47,960
I don't regret, I wonder what it is

819
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:51,880
Tell me that beyond

820
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,120
someone calls you a serious human being

821
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,200
You know how he behaves

822
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,200
When I tell him

823
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,600
he actually gets effects of betraying people

824
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,360
This trend always continues

825
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,360
What did you say?

826
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,360
Say it again.

827
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,360
You see,

828
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:18,360
the business of the local government and the environmental company is not as good as you think.

829
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:21,360
You know,

830
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:25,360
Hua Tengchun is the company of the environmental company.

831
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,360
Moreover,

832
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:31,360
the company of the environmental company and Hua Tengchun is very good.

833
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:35,360
I'm not the one who let you down because you suspect the local government.

834
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,360
I'm not the one who is the president.

835
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,360
So you're the one who bought it.

836
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:43,360
I'm not the one who let you down because you're the one who bought it.

837
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:46,360
Even if you know, you'll lose.

838
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:49,360
I won't tell Hua Tengchun about it.

839
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:53,360
I'll let you know where you're going.

840
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,360
Let's go to the casino.

841
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,360
But I'll lose.

842
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,360
I'll go to the casino.

843
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,360
You two are the real brothers.

844
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,360
What did you say?

845
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,360
I don't know.

846
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,360
I don't know.

847
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,360
I don't know if we're going to win.

848
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,360
Run!

849
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,360
I'll kill you.

850
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:05,360
The Law Firm

851
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:09,360
Good morning, Law Firm.

852
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,360
Xiaole, why did you call me that?

853
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,360
You're helping us.

854
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,360
I want to be your wife.

855
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,360
I want to talk about Law Firm from now on.

856
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:21,360
It's okay if Hua Tengchun and Tantan call me that.

857
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,360
You can just call me Law Firm.

858
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:27,360
Or you can call me Wai Qian's father.

859
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:30,360
But I don't want to call you Wai Qian's father.

860
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,360
Why?

861
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:35,360
You called me Wai Qian's father yesterday.

862
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:39,360
But I've grown up.

863
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:42,360
I'm a big man now.

864
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:47,360
I'll get you to help us.

865
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:49,360
Are we really going to help?

866
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:52,360
Will we be forced to do that?

867
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:57,360
I promise I won't let them go.

868
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:58,360
I promise.

869
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,360
Really?

870
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:03,360
Okay, I'll call you Wai Qian.

871
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,360
I'll call you Wai Qian.

872
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,360
Xiaole, you're going to be late.

873
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,360
Who told you to sleep so late?

874
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:10,360
You haven't even got up early.

875
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:13,360
And you said you'd be a big man.

876
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:16,360
It's okay if you're late.

877
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:21,360
I'll take my money with me.

878
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:25,360
What should I do?

879
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:28,360
I'll put on your clothes.

880
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,360
I'll take care of you.

881
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,360
You should eat.

882
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:52,360
I'll take care of you.

883
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,360
I'll take care of you.

884
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:01,360
I'll take care of you.

885
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,360
What's up?

886
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:33,360
Nothing.

887
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:35,360
I'm going to the office.

888
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:37,360
I'll get Wai Qian's treatment.

889
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:40,360
You said you'd help us.

890
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,360
Do you have any progress?

891
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,360
I'll give you a call when I find the treatment.

892
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:50,360
I want to know why you must buy this.

893
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:54,360
They came to see you.

894
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:55,360
You're complaining.

895
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:58,360
These merchants are not rich.

896
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:01,360
They've already sold the factory.

897
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:05,360
They still have to sell the only piece of land.

898
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:09,360
This is not the first time you've bought land with Village Head.

899
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:12,360
Yes, but Village Head's business is not good.

900
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:16,360
Then, Binzai took the first opportunity to borrow money to buy land.

901
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:19,360
He's afraid that the whole garden will be lost.

902
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:24,360
The company will have a long-term negotiation.

903
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,360
And the harvest will be successful.

904
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:29,360
But now, because Binzai lost,

905
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,360
he's become the biggest winner.

906
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,360
This is too strong.

907
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:37,360
Before, their department head had to find the village head.

908
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:39,360
If all the villagers can move,

909
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:41,360
they'll be strong.

910
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:45,360
I don't understand why they have to buy this land.

911
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:48,360
Ya Mo, I'm full.

912
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,360
Let's go to the...

913
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,360
Let's go to the...

914
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:16,360
Let's go to the school.

915
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:18,360
Okay, I'll help you.

916
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:20,360
It's okay.

917
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,360
Your hands are itchy.

918
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,360
Don't touch your mouth.

919
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,360
What are you talking about?

920
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,360
Nothing.

921
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:31,360
I didn't know why I was allergic to honey when I was working in the garden.

922
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,360
But now, I'm much better.

923
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:35,360
I'm sure it's because I'm handling the document in the office.

924
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:39,360
Mo, I'll just have to catch up with you.

925
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,360
Good night, Miss.

926
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:53,360
The End

927
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:15,360
Boss, did you get the answer to the land condition of the village?

928
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:16,360
Yes, I did.

929
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,360
I'm looking at it.

930
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:23,360
I heard that the factory near the village is all in the field.

931
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:24,360
That's right.

932
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:26,360
The company that is the source of the land is called the Boli Produce Company.

933
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,360
It's only $13 billion.

934
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:30,360
The factory produces 50,000 tons of glass every year.

935
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,360
Because of the production of glass,

936
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,360
the plant will produce large amounts of plant waste every year.

937
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,360
That will cause high-intensity pollution.

938
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:38,360
So, the environment is set up to clean the plant.

939
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,360
The waste that was taken from the photo shop

940
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:41,360
was taken from the plant.

941
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,360
Did the factory in the field

942
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:45,360
be normal until today?

943
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,360
Their environmental reports are very normal.

944
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,360
They are all in the security record.

945
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,360
I have a copy of the data.

946
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:52,360
It's in the home file.

947
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,360
Boss, you can have a look.

948
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,360
Thank you.

949
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:57,360
Go and do your work.

950
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:06,360
Why must you buy the land?

951
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:21,360
Lawyer Ren, is something wrong?

952
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:23,360
As the director of the Ministry of the Development and Development of the industry,

953
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:27,360
you should know that Mr. He bought the land under the supervision of the village.

954
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:28,360
What's the use of doing that?

955
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,360
Why are you asking me that?

956
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,360
I don't think this is safe.

957
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,360
I'm sure that Mr. He bought the land.

958
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:38,360
I'm sure that he's not like the general development.

959
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:39,360
Isn't the chairman asking you to stop

960
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:41,360
and stop investigating this matter?

961
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:45,360
If you still want to get married with Mr. He,

962
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:47,360
don't interfere with this matter anymore.

963
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:48,360
Why?

964
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:50,360
Is it because I guessed it right?

965
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:52,360
This matter is really not safe.

966
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:53,360
This is a matter of concern.

967
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:54,360
I've been handling it.

968
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:57,360
And the deadline for a week is tomorrow.

969
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:59,360
I've already applied for a strong executive order.

970
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:02,360
Tomorrow, I must all the villagers

971
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:03,360
to move to Hua Tian Village.

972
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:07,360
I advise you to listen to the chairman.

973
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,360
If you can't, you should go back to Taipei.

974
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:18,360
Who's going to be the next?

975
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:22,360
Mr. He!

976
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,360
Hurry up!

977
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:29,360
These eggs...

978
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:32,360
Don't you forget that I told you last time

979
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:35,360
that my family's mother-in-law had a baby.

980
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,360
She's been giving birth to a baby.

981
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:39,360
This is their love-hate relationship.

982
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:41,360
You said you wanted to be a baby.

983
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:42,360
Help me separate the eggs.

984
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:44,360
Hurry up and help me get pregnant.

985
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,360
Right, Mr. Ren.

986
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:50,360
Actually, you can't just go back to Taipei.

987
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:53,360
Help us to get a big house in Hua Tian Village.

988
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:56,360
Actually, we're much older than that.

989
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,360
We don't need to have any big family.

990
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:00,360
And look at this,

991
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:02,360
this is the birth certificate of the baby.

992
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:09,360
Sorry, Mr. Ren.

993
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,360
Mr. Ren, you...

994
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,360
I mean, you've taken it.

995
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,360
Look at this.

996
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:21,360
There are so many pictures and notes.

997
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:23,360
You don't even like us.

998
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:27,360
So you're really nice to us.

999
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:30,360
I'm not as good as you said.

1000
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,360
Mr. Ren, you're so mean.

1001
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:38,360
Mr. Ren, you're the great man in Hua Tian Village.

1002
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:41,360
Look at you.

1003
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,360
You're not going to the market.

1004
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:48,360
You're going to see our last scene in Hua Tian Village.

1005
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:50,360
I've thought about it.

1006
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:52,360
Even if we get a lot of encouragement,

1007
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:54,360
it's okay if we don't have anything.

1008
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:57,360
We need to be sincere.

1009
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:00,360
I want to save my life.

1010
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:02,360
I'm so old now.

1011
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,360
I don't have anything to repay him.

1012
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,360
He said he wanted to sign the certificate.

1013
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:08,360
I signed it.

1014
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:10,360
Mr. Ren, where's the certificate?

1015
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:11,360
Where's the certificate?

1016
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,360
I don't know.

1017
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:20,360
You can't sign the certificate.

1018
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,360
Why?

1019
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,360
I actually...

1020
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:28,360
I'm just kidding.

1021
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:34,360
You're so mean.

1022
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:35,360
You're so mean.

1023
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:36,360
You're just saying that.

1024
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:38,360
You're not as good as you said.

1025
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:41,360
What?

1026
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:42,360
You're so mean.

1027
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:44,360
What's wrong with him?

1028
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:46,360
He's not dead yet.

1029
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:48,360
You're so mean.

1030
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:49,360
You're so mean.

1031
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:50,360
You're so mean.

1032
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:51,360
You're lying.

1033
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:55,360
Ren Guangxi is the one who sent us here.

1034
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,360
He's a liar.

1035
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:06,360
We're going to Hua Tian Village.

1036
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:08,360
We're going to Hua Tian Village.

1037
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,360
We're going to Hua Tian Village.

1038
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:11,360
Stop it.

1039
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:12,360
Stop it.

1040
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:13,360
Stop it.

1041
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,360
I don't know how to explain this to you.

1042
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:18,360
Even if this person in front of you

1043
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,360
was the one who sent all the documents,

1044
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,360
he was still the one who

1045
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:24,360
was so sincere

1046
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:26,360
to help Ren Guangxi.

1047
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:29,360
Are you lying to him or to yourself?

1048
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,360
Or to me?

1049
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,360
This is the photo I got this morning.

1050
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,360
The glass in Hua Tian Village

1051
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,360
might have been the one who sent the letter.

1052
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,360
Taipei, please give me another chance.

1053
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,360
I'm willing to leave the 80-point card to the public.

1054
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,360
You're not even in the right place to call me a liar.

1055
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,360
Do you have the right to know it tomorrow?

1056
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,360
By then, I'll go to Hua Tian Village

1057
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,360
to get the compensation for my client.

1058
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:53,360
Stop it.

1059
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:54,360
Let go of me.

1060
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:55,360
Let go of me.

1061
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,360
I was so sad in the past.

1062
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,360
Even if you forget all the memories,

1063
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:02,360
some things won't change.

1064
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,360
You're taking dad as your client.

1065
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:07,360
You won't be a liar.

1066
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:09,360
I don't understand why

1067
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,360
you sent me to stay here.

1068
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:13,360
I don't know what you're doing.

1069
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:16,360
And I'm the only one who can help you.

1070
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:17,360
Why?

1071
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:20,360
I'm a man.

1072
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:21,360
I don't care.

1073
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,360
I'm like a rose.

1074
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,360
I'll give you the money.

1075
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,360
We can't be biased.

1076
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,360
Who taught you to be so bad?

1077
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,360
You must eat the carrot.

1078
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,360
Can I eat it?

1079
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,360
No.

1080
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:36,360
I'm sure you know.

1081
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:38,360
I'll eat it.

1082
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,360
I'm relieved to hear that.

1083
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:42,360
How can you prove that?

1084
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,360
You must dress up.

1085
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:46,360
I'll wear the outfit.

1086
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:47,360
Where are we going?

1087
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:48,360
To the village.

1088
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,360
I'm so sad.

1089
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:10,360
I'm so happy.

1090
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,360
I'm so happy.

1091
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,360
I'm so happy.

1092
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:16,360
I'm so happy.

1093
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,360
I'm so happy.

1094
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,360
I'm so happy.

1095
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:22,360
I'm so happy.

1096
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:24,360
I'm so happy.

1097
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,360
I'm so happy.

1098
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:28,360
I'm so happy.

1099
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:30,360
I'm so happy.

1100
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,360
I'm so happy.

1101
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,360
I'm so happy.

1102
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:36,360
I'm so happy.

1103
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:38,360
I'm so happy.

1104
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:40,360
I'm so happy.

1105
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,360
I'm so happy.

1106
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,360
I'm so happy.

1107
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,360
I'm so happy.

1108
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,360
I'm so happy.

1109
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,360
I'm so happy.

1110
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,360
I'm so happy.

1111
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:54,360
I'm so happy.

1112
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,360
