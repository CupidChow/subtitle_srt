1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Next, I will broadcast for you the next happy moment.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Mishou! Mishou!

3
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The wind is blowing.

4
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
My dream is cruel, but I won't forget it.

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I believed in the future for him.

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I don't know how bad the world is.

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I love him. I fall into the water.

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I believed in the future for him.

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I don't know how bad the world is.

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The first heaven, the final lie.

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I don't know why I'm so upset.

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
If there's any problem, please call me.

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Are you sure you're going to America?

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm so upset that I suddenly decided to divorce.

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Should I think about it?

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I've made my decision.

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I won't regret it.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And I don't have any reason to stay.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Let's go. The plane is about to take off.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Hello?

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Xiaoliu! Why is he not here?

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Where are you?

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'll go find you.

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I told you I don't want to see you.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I don't want you to go to the temple.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is our relationship.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We don't want to see each other.

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I've decided to stay with you.

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You should be with me.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Don't you think I'm a coward?

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Xiaoliu didn't come to fight with us.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He's been away for hours.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
He's been with us for hours.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Calm down.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What does Xiaoliu want to do?

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We're all brothers.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Why can't she tell us?

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Shall we call the police?

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The Police

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The police?

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Who's the police?

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Why is he here?

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll tell you how your parents feel.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm sure you're right.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
We should be together.

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That's right.

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We should stay together.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
We can't go without seeing each other.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That's right.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
We'll have a meeting soon.

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But, baby,

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
is my parents so smart?

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You're right.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I don't like you.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Why does that sound sound so familiar?

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Is it the ghost they're making?

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That's weird.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What's so weird about it?

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
No matter what,

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Xiaoliu is in their hands.

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
We should take care of her.

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Let's go.

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I didn't expect you to be in this state.

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You're already married.

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I haven't paid for your book yet.

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The first game of the day

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The first game of the day

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The first game of the day

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The first game of the day

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The first game of the day

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The first game of the day

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The first game of the day

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The first game of the day

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The first game of the day

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The first game of the day

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The first game of the day

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The first game of the day

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The first game of the day

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The first game of the day

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Okay.

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Let's see what else is there in the table.

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's okay.

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
After you finish,

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'll help you with the rest.

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Who said I wanted to sign it?

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I won't sign that divorce certificate.

87
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I just told you that

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I don't want to divorce.

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
This time,

91
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I want to face myself in the city.

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
There were too many reasons before.

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I forced you to lie to me.

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But if time comes again,

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I will choose to confess to you.

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Tell you everything.

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The truth is,

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
six years ago,

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I was a real man.

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I was pretending to leave that time.

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Actually, I really want to stay.

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
For the past six years,

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I pretended to be fine.

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Actually, I'm not.

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I pretended to be fine.

106
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I can bless you and Yixing.

107
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Actually, I'm jealous of her.

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I want to be brave with myself.

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Actually, I'm very angry.

110
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So when I see you again,

111
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I don't know how to tell you.

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I don't know how to face you.

113
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I just want to choose to cover up

114
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
everything.

115
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Why are you telling me this now?

116
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I gave you so many chances.

117
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You made me lose my mind.

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You're thinking about it now.

119
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You think we can continue.

120
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And then tell me these?

121
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
How do you want me to answer?

122
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
tabii National Conservatives

123
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
This isuntilability.

124
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,600
свой

125
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,600
Since you want to be honest with yourself,

126
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
at the billet party that night,

127
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:19,600
Then, do you really want to leave or stay?

128
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,600
If time comes again, I will still leave.

129
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:32,600
But this time, I will tell you first what the reason for me to find Tu Yuan is.

130
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,600
Because I believe in your love for me.

131
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,600
I will not leave you.

132
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Then, let me ask you.

133
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,600
If you think that now you are back safely,

134
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,600
will you still leave us and go to America?

135
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,600
I will not leave you.

136
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,600
I will not leave you.

137
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,600
It's not like that.

138
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,600
If you think that now you are back safely,

139
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,600
do you still need to walk much longer?

140
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,600
Will you still leave us and go to America?

141
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
I didn't stay in the company.

142
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,600
You once said that we are both good at playing the wind.

143
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,600
The chance and fate have half of the chance.

144
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,600
The life I will restore to memory is like playing the game again.

145
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
I gave you the chance.

146
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,600
In the end, we still meet the same fate.

147
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,600
I have too many doubts about you.

148
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Maybe, if we can part ways for a while, it will be better.

149
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
Then you can leave.

150
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Anyway, I will wait for you to come back.

151
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,600
Wait for you to come back to my life.

152
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,600
If our life is like playing the wind,

153
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,600
no matter how many times we can love each other,

154
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
the result should be the same.

155
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,600
Because you are my fate.

156
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Do you remember six years ago,

157
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,600
we were together here?

158
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Do you know what I told you?

159
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
I begged him to forgive me.

160
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,600
But I wanted to say that I couldn't say it.

161
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,600
What did you say?

162
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
I would like to.

163
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Actually, I have never said anything to you in the past six years.

164
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,600
But now, the answer hasn't changed.

165
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:30,600
I am willing to give our love another chance.

166
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Whatever you said,

167
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,600
don't let go of anything you want.

168
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
Including the people you care about.

169
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:02,600
So, if I tell you,

170
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
I love you.

171
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Will you leave for this reason?

172
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
I have given you a chance to make a decision.

173
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,600
You leave me.

174
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,600
This time, I will leave.

175
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
I will leave.

176
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
If you let go of my hand again.

177
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Love

178
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
You are so sweet.

179
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
I am not.

180
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
I am just a little girl.

181
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,600
I am just a little girl.

182
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,600
Xiao Le, I have met your mother.

183
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,600
She is so stupid.

184
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,600
But, when she is normal,

185
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
she is so quiet.

186
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
Don't worry. They will be fine.

187
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
Right.

188
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
Are you sure?

189
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,600
Yes.

190
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,600
I am not taking pictures of you.

191
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,600
Why?

192
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,600
I want Xiao Le, Auntie Hua and Tuoyuan to be together.

193
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,600
Do you want to help them?

194
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Why?

195
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,600
Who doesn't know?

196
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
You know, I can tell you that I am angry.

197
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
Because my son is here to help me do this.

198
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,600
I didn't mean it.

199
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
And,

200
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,600
I was so sincere.

201
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
I just want to keep you.

202
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,600
Don't be nervous.

203
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
Even if I tell you,

204
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
the judge will not accept it.

205
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,600
Because this is the relationship between you and me.

206
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,600
Everything I said just now,

207
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
is sincere.

208
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
I am not sincere.

209
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,600
But, you still have to accompany me in my mental damage.

210
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Yang Wuchen,

211
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
I want to play with you.

212
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
The thing I want to accompany you is,

213
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
to be with you forever.

214
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
You are so cute.

215
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
You are so cute.

216
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
You are so cute.

217
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
Xiao Le,

218
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
you are not good enough to go to the airport.

219
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,600
You are not good enough to go to the airport.

220
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
I will call you.

221
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,600
You have to forgive me.

222
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
I am doing this for you and your sister.

223
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
You are so cute.

224
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,600
What are you doing?

225
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Congratulations.

226
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Did you buy the ticket?

227
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
The ticket is gone.

228
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Let's go.

229
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,600
I want to take the bus.

230
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
I want to take the next train.

231
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,600
Next time...

232
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,600
So,

233
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
you really decided to go to the US?

234
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,600
Of course, I will go.

235
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,600
I won't forget the deep hurt

236
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,600
I won't forget the deep hurt

237
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,600
So you really decided to go back to America?

238
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
Of course I will go

239
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,600
I'll only have one day to discuss this

240
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Anyway, I'll be back in three days

241
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
I've already forgiven you

242
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
I was going to come back from America

243
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,600
I was going to talk to you for a while

244
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,600
I didn't expect you to be so active

245
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
So I accepted

246
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,600
So you didn't go to America to work?

247
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
What about the single-term ticket?

248
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,600
That's for Xiaoling

249
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
I'm not sure when she'll come back to America

250
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
So I asked Gary to book a single-term ticket

251
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,600
You've forgiven me long ago

252
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
Why did you divorce me?

253
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,600
Because I forced you when we got married

254
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
But I'm not sure about you

255
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,600
So I hope you can reconsider

256
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,600
So I'll give you the right to choose

257
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,600
But it doesn't mean I don't want to be with you

258
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,600
I just want you to stay by my side

259
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,600
Aren't you afraid that I'll sign you?

260
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
It's okay

261
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
Because when you got the divorce

262
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
You need two witnesses to prove it

263
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,600
Even if you sign it, as long as I don't admit it

264
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
I'll be the one to prove it

265
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,600
You're the real master of the plot

266
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
Why do you like to go to the movies?

267
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,600
So you think you can stay by my side?

268
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Let's go

269
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,600
I want to go home to see our lovely dinner

270
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
What about you?

271
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,600
I'm going to kill Gary

272
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,600
Actually, no matter where we are

273
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,600
I'm happy to have you by my side

274
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,600
I'm happy to have you by my side

275
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,600
I'm happy to have you by my side

276
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,600
I'm happy to have you by my side

277
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,600
I'm happy to have you by my side

278
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,600
I'm happy to have you by my side

279
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,600
I'm happy to have you by my side

280
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,600
I'm happy to have you by my side

281
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,600
I'm happy to have you by my side

282
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,600
I'm happy to have you by my side

283
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,600
Brother Tuye

284
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,600
I'm so sorry to have you by my side

285
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Aren't you happy?

286
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,600
No

287
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,600
I can't accept it

288
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,600
Why would I be unhappy?

289
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Then why don't you say anything?

290
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
I was just thinking

291
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,600
You can't lie to me like this

292
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
I'm not lying

293
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Actually, my Chinese is good

294
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,600
It's just that my father doesn't speak standard

295
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
I'm his daughter

296
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,600
Of course I have to follow his standard

297
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
I'm like a family

298
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,600
Here

299
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,600
A gift for the wind

300
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,600
Why is it a flower?

301
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,600
Do you know where the flower is?

302
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,600
He wants to

303
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
He wants to

304
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
He doesn't want to meet you

305
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Just like you

306
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
Well

307
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,600
Can you send me a question next time?

308
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
Just ask

309
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
Come

310
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,600
Boss

311
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,600
Since you help whoever rent the house

312
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,400
Also, I took divorce agreement to cheat her.

313
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,200
Actually, I feel very frustrated.

314
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,400
But thank you for your kind words.

315
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,000
Do you have any other questions?

316
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,900
A client asked you to help him get the money.

317
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,700
He said he wanted to leave all the property to his daughter.

318
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,400
But he has never seen his daughter in six years.

319
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,400
Da Da Da

320
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,400
Mo Chuan!

321
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,000
Why is Kukiya so cool?

322
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,700
The doctors in this magazine are the best doctors.

323
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,200
Also, Kukiya gave a gift to the doctor a few days ago.

324
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,400
She remembered to thank him.

325
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,000
Do you know that?

326
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,600
I'm so excited.

327
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,800
I always fall in love.

328
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,600
I want to stay in love.

329
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,000
It turns out that I should be like this.

330
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm going to take the money, Grandpa Ma!

331
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,400
Ma, come here.

332
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,000
Ma, sit down.

333
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,400
Sit down.

334
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,600
Ma, come here.

335
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,200
Ma, come here.

336
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm the most popular one here.

337
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
This one.

338
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,200
This one.

339
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,800
I'll give it to you.

340
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,000
I understand.

341
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,600
I don't care about the past.

342
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,800
I'm so happy.

343
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,800
I love you.

344
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,000
I love you, Kukiya.

345
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,800
I love you.

346
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,000
I want to be with you.

347
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,600
I want to be with you.

348
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,800
I always fall in love.

349
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,600
I want to stay in love.

350
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,400
It turns out that I should be like this.

351
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,000
I always fall in love.

352
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,600
Xiao Le said you were always smiling.

353
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,400
So, you wanted a kiss.

354
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,800
I didn't expect you to be more and more active.

355
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,400
Xiao Le said that because you love me, you should smile.

356
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,400
Love is a heart.

357
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,000
Love is a heart.

358
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Love is a heart.

359
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,600
Love is a heart.

360
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:59,600
I still don't understand the past.
