We'll air the next episode for you

3
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,040
sorry

4
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,740
Didn't dad promise me that he would come to listen to my song?

5
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,240
It's okay. The kid is already done.

6
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,440
Dad can listen to it in the car later, okay?

7
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,840
Dad!

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,640
Dad!

9
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,140
Sorry for coming late.

10
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,940
Xia Lih is my little princess.

11
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,640
I just want to give you a gift.

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,040
I like it.

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,840
What secret are you two talking about?

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,240
It's okay. Let's get in the car.

15
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,440
Today, the piano teacher is in front of all the kids.

16
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,240
There is a pair of playing piano hands in Mu Chen.

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,940
He is better than anyone else.

18
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,640
Uncle Yang, Mu Chen has a pair of very suitable hands to play piano.

19
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,840
You have to keep these hands well.

20
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,440
Of course. Mu Chen loves to play piano.

21
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,340
This is for kids.

22
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,240
Like he spent his birthday today.

23
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,340
He said he didn't want to miss the piano class. He had to come.

24
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,040
So today is Mu Chen's birthday.

25
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,040
Yes.

26
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,440
Let's say happy birthday to Mu Chen together, okay?

27
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,440
Happy birthday!

28
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,440
How is it? Which one is it?

29
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,840
I want the strawberry cake.

30
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,240
It's so expensive.

31
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,440
Chief, Ying Hai is moving our assets.

32
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,640
The shareholders will know that the company is going to collapse.

33
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,440
No one is helping me.

34
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,640
You are going to tell me to break the property.

35
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,640
Okay.

36
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,740
I need to put the money bag in the car.

37
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,440
You go and get it.

38
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,440
I'll go and order the cake.

39
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,040
Okay.

40
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,640
Okay.

41
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,640
The car is broken.

42
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,640
So scary.

43
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,640
Hurry and help me.

44
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,640
Ying Hai!

45
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,640
It's Ying Zhong!

46
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,640
Ying Zhong, what's wrong with you?

47
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,640
Help me!

48
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,640
Hurry and help me!

49
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,640
Mom, the teacher said that we will be in a bad situation next time.

50
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,640
I think we should go to the school.

51
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,640
You should go to the bathroom.

52
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,960
What should we do next time?

53
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,940
My family is very poor.

54
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,640
I don't have to take our money back when the teacher passed away.

55
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,640
You just have to give it back.

56
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,640
That bird!

57
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,640
It's cooked.

58
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,640
Your family won't come back again!

59
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,640
Don't do this

60
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,620
A Secret

61
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,240
Little O이라고

62
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,360
I importantly

63
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,960
I want Xiaowan

64
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,640
The first game of the game is the first game of the game.

65
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,640
The first game of the game is the first game of the game.

66
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,640
The first game of the game is the first game of the game.

67
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,640
The first game of the game is the first game of the game.

68
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,640
The first game of the game is the first game of the game.

69
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,640
The first game of the game is the first game of the game.

70
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,640
The first game of the game is the first game of the game.

71
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,640
The first game of the game is the first game of the game.

72
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,640
The first game of the game is the first game of the game.

73
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,640
The first game of the game is the first game of the game.

74
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,640
The first game of the game is the first game of the game.

75
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,640
The first game of the game is the first game of the game.

76
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,640
The first game of the game is the first game of the game.

77
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,640
The first game of the game is the first game of the game.

78
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,640
Let's go to the entertainment station 94466.

79
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,640
Come.

80
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,640
Don't run.

81
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,640
What are you doing?

82
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,640
Why did you pull my board?

83
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,640
Sorry.

84
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,640
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,640
Why are you so weak?

86
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,640
I'm sorry.

87
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,640
Don't be afraid.

88
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,640
Don't be afraid.

89
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,640
Don't be afraid.

90
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,640
Let's go.

91
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,640
Let's go.

92
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,640
OK.

93
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,640
Let's go.

94
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,640
Let's go.

95
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,640
Bye.

96
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,640
Bye.

97
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,640
Bye.

98
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,640
Bye.

99
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,640
Dad.

100
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,640
Can't you take your dad away?

101
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,640
I don't want to take him away.

102
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,640
Liang Mu Chen!

103
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,640
Liang Mu Chen!

104
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,640
What do you want to do?

105
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,640
Your dad is the one who's been stealing your money.

106
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,640
He's not even a kid.

107
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,640
He's dead.

108
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,640
He's dead!

109
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,640
Why are you so angry?

110
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,640
You're like me.

111
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,640
You have nothing to do with me.

112
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,640
You deserve to be my wife!

113
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,640
Let me see.

114
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,640
Let me see what you have.

115
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,640
You're really...

116
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,640
It's okay.

117
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,640
Liang Mu Chen!

118
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,640
What are you doing?

119
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,640
You're leaving?

120
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,640
I'm tired.

121
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,640
I don't want to be in your belly.

122
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,640
But Uncle...

123
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,640
Don't care about anything.

124
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,640
You're not going to listen to me?

125
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,640
I'm not going to listen to you.

126
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,640
You're not going to listen to me?

127
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,640
Eat.

128
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,640
It's getting cold.

129
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,640
Thank you.

130
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,640
Thank you.

131
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,640
You have nothing to do with me!

132
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,640
You have no money!

133
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,640
You have no money!

134
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,640
You have nothing to do with me!

135
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,640
You have nothing to do with me!

136
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,640
You have nothing to do with me!

137
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,640
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,640
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,640
Mu Chen, take the car back.

141
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,640
Thank you.

142
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,640
I'm not going to belong to this place anymore.

143
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:35,640
The first heaven, the final lie.

144
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,640
Boss, I gave you something yesterday.

145
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,640
Don't you forget it?

146
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,640
You want a pair of shoes?

147
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,640
I'm holding two big ones.

148
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,640
This one is for you.

149
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,640
We agreed to give you five.

150
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,640
It's two thousand.

151
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,640
I'm holding two big ones.

152
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,640
I'm holding two big ones.

153
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,640
I'm holding two big ones.

154
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,640
I'm holding two big ones.

155
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,640
I'm holding two big ones.

156
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,640
I'm holding two big ones.

157
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,640
It's two thousand.

158
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,640
No need.

159
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,640
I've done a good job here.

160
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,640
This is for your son.

161
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,640
I'm giving you a bonus.

162
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,640
Don't tell Boss.

163
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,640
Don't forget to hide in the sun.

164
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,640
If you accidentally get wet on the road,

165
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,640
you'll be late for home.

166
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,640
You'll be late for the next half.

167
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,640
I know.

168
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,640
I know.

169
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,640
My car.

170
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,640
Wait for me.

171
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,640
You have to be in the car.

172
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,640
You'll be free after the exam.

173
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,640
Boss, don't be shy.

174
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,640
I'll buy you a car.

175
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,640
It's so cold.

176
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,640
I'm going to the toilet.

177
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,640
What's the problem?

178
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,640
I'm going to the toilet.

179
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,640
You're going to the toilet.

180
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,640
Get off.

181
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,640
Is this okay?

182
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,640
I don't want other men to give me things.

183
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,640
You don't need to eat vinegar anymore.

184
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,640
You think I'm eating other men's vinegar?

185
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,640
So I'm asking you to get off.

186
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,640
I'm giving you a chance

187
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,640
to get away from the worst man in the world.

188
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,640
It's me.

189
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,640
Ren Guangxi.

190
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,640
Get off.

191
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
Guangxi.

192
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,640
Don't be like this.

193
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,640
I really like you.

194
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,640
You like me?

195
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,640
I'll give you 10 seconds

196
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,640
to find out if you have a heart attack.

197
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,640
I'll prove that you like me.

198
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,640
I heard that you have a heart attack.

199
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,640
Try it.

200
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,640
Let me know how much you have a heart attack.

201
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,640
Are you kidding me?

202
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
I don't know how to get off.

203
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,640
You want to take her to the toilet?

204
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,640
You're not going to be a burden to me.

205
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,640
You're not going to be a burden to me.

206
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,640
I'll give you 10 seconds.

207
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,640
You know I'm giving you a chance to get off.

208
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,640
Please call me quickly.

209
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,640
I'm going to the toilet.

210
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,640
I'll get a woman's heart attack.

211
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,640
You tell me.

212
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,640
I'll give you a chance to get off.

213
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,640
Miss.

214
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,640
What's that?

215
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,640
Take it.

216
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,640
I'm sorry.

217
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,640
I didn't mean to interrupt your conversation.

218
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,640
But please stop the car.

219
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,640
Let the company go by the side of the line.

220
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,640
You can talk to them.

221
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,640
Sorry.

222
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,640
I didn't mean to talk to them.

223
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,640
I'll take the car.

224
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
It's a big deal.

225
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,640
Let's split up.

226
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,640
The car is hers.

227
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,640
You tell her.

228
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,640
Sir.

229
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,640
Sir.

230
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,640
Sir, you still haven't solved your problem.

231
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,640
Sir.

232
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,640
No.

233
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,640
The car is blocked.

234
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,640
Please drive the car away.

235
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,640
Then we can go back.

236
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,640
Miss.

237
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,640
You know what?

238
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,640
Love affairs are the most common.

239
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,640
For example,

240
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,640
it's a man's interest.

241
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,640
It's none of your business.

242
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,640
Get out of my way.

243
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,640
I don't care.

244
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,640
I just want to take my donkey home.

245
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,640
You two.

246
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,640
Even the kids in kindergarten

247
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,640
know that walking on the right side

248
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,640
can't stop the car.

249
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,640
You two look like

250
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,640
college students.

251
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
Miss.

252
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,640
Don't talk to him so much.

253
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,640
If you don't eat the car,

254
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,640
you'll be beaten to death.

255
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,640
Shut up.

256
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
Miss.

257
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,640
You're so...

258
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,640
heartless.

259
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,640
But you really made me feel a bit embarrassed.

260
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,640
You even gave me a sign.

261
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,640
How about we take her to the hospital?

262
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,640
What do you want?

263
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,640
Get in the car.

264
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,640
It's easy to leave here.

265
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,640
I'll teach you how to drive.

266
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,640
I won't drive.

267
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,640
I'll teach you.

268
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,640
So you want to take the car?

269
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,640
You're taking the car again.

270
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,640
Let's move.

271
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,640
What's going on?

272
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,640
You're so heartless.

273
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,640
And then?

274
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,640
The next step is very important.

275
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,640
Don't hesitate.

276
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,640
You have to do one move.

277
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,640
Put the car away.

278
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,640
And pull it to the bottom.

279
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,640
Left foot.

280
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,640
Right foot.

281
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,640
Get out of the way.

282
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,640
Don't move.

283
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,640
Don't move.

284
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,640
Don't move.

285
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,640
I'll teach you how to drive.

286
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,640
Let me go.

287
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,640
Let me go.

288
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,640
Let me go.

289
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,640
I don't want to go back.

290
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,640
I'll teach you how to drive.

291
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,640
Let me go.

292
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,640
I've explained it clearly.

293
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,640
I'm a bus driver.

294
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,640
I'm not a bus driver.

295
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,640
You're different from the driver.

296
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,640
Mr. Guangxi has admitted that

297
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,640
he's the one who killed his girlfriend.

298
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,640
He's a bad guy.

299
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,640
It's dangerous to betray public.

300
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,640
I'm the one who killed his girlfriend.

301
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,640
I don't know this woman.

302
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,640
I'm from her family.

303
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,640
Mr. Guangxi.

304
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
What's my name?

305
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,640
Work.

306
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,640
Work?

307
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,640
You're leaving with a big gun.

308
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,640
I'll repeat it once more.

309
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,640
It's none of your business.

310
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,640
Do you want me to write the details of the girl

311
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,640
in the notebook?

312
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,640
Be careful.

313
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,640
It's a crime to be a police officer.

314
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,640
What are you doing?

315
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,640
This is a police station.

316
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,640
You're all innocent.

317
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,640
Your dad is a spy in Shengde University.

318
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,640
How can you not understand?

319
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,640
No one can treat me like this.

320
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,640
Including you.

321
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,640
I want you to pay for what you did today.

322
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,640
Mr. Jingta.

323
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,640
His girlfriend has left.

324
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,640
I should have left with him.

325
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,640
I have an urgent matter to attend to.

326
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,640
I have to go back.

327
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,640
This...

328
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,640
You have to see

329
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,640
whether Mr. Jingta is going to marry you.

330
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,640
After all, you're the one who hit him.

331
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,640
This car...

332
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
is expensive.

333
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,640
It's expensive?

334
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,640
Mr. Jingta,

335
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,640
you and I know each other very well.

336
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,640
It's your fault that the car was hit.

337
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,640
It's not my fault.

338
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,640
You were the one who hit the car.

339
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,640
Don't think of it like this.

340
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,640
It's just a sense of security.

341
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,640
How much money do you need to pay for the show?

342
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,640
A sense of security.

343
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
The exam period.

344
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,640
The internal part.

345
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,640
How much money can't you get out of it?

346
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,640
How many tens of thousands?

347
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,640
Who told you to be so selfish?

348
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,640
I will ask you to tell them the truth.

349
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,640
You asked me to get in the car.

350
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,640
I'm not a selfish person.

351
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,640
If I had told you this,

352
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,640
the insurance company wouldn't have accompanied me.

353
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,640
I have an urgent matter to attend to.

354
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,640
I only have 15 minutes left to send the fish back.

355
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,640
Mr. Ko Don't worry about it anymore.

356
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,640
Can I settle with the ShinWow Administrator.

357
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:26,640
You're just a Iím clan,

358
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,640
and you shouldn't care about anything in your life,

359
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,440
You're the one you're hurting.

360
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,040
Because you're so selfish,

361
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,440
you treat yourself as a垃圾,

362
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,440
and you're not going to lose me!

363
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,440
That's right.

364
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,940
I'm just a垃圾.

365
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,240
After I was 8 years old, I got PTSD.

366
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,640
I was in the same year as I was born,

367
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,040
and I was unable to control my emotions.

368
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,240
Love is a problem.

369
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,940
I'm selfish.

370
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,040
Like a垃圾,

371
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,240
the same life.

372
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,040
Are you satisfied?

373
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,340
What's wrong?

374
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,440
I didn't hear that we had a father.

375
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,240
So I'm sorry.

376
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,340
Who told you to be so heartless?

377
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,740
Give me a new challenge.

378
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,140
It's dangerous to hit a car in public.

379
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,140
I've never thought about dealing with such a case.

380
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,340
Actually, Mr. Lin,

381
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,040
you don't need to appear.

382
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,640
I can handle it myself.

383
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,240
The set you put me on

384
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,540
and the set you set me on

385
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,240
I've prepared it all.

386
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,940
If you don't believe me, you can ask that woman.

387
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,240
I was just supported.

388
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,140
There's no such disease.

389
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,540
It's also one of the characteristics of it.

390
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,640
I'm only a psychologist.

391
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,040
I'm just a psychologist.

392
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,940
I'm sorry.

393
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,040
I was in a situation of emotional management.

394
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,140
I'm still in the process of receiving the treatment.

395
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,640
I believe that all the money here should have records.

396
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,340
So I'm going to represent him today

397
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,840
to handle the procedures of the law.

398
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,840
Apоче.

399
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,440
P

400
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,840
Introduce fields here.

401
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,640
Look,

402
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,740
I'm putting the irregular Chinese spell.

403
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,740
Hey.

404
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,440
What's the Japanese spell?

405
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,440
Okay.

406
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,740
Well.

407
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,740
You're helping her to get more professional.

408
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,040
Miss,

409
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,040
after you leave the police,

410
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,040
we can settle this.

411
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,040
Miss, come back.

412
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,540
We're going to get up.

413
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,540
Miss, come back.

414
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,540
You're playing with me.

415
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,040
I'm so nervous.

416
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,040
Don't worry.

417
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,040
I'm here to help you.

418
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,040
I know you're the one who saved the driver.

419
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,540
You're the one who cheated on the driver.

420
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,540
You're right.

421
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,540
Police,

422
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,540
I told you,

423
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,540
that lady is kind.

424
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,540
You must be mad at her.

425
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,540
She cheated on the driver

426
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,040
and the car.

427
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,540
We've seen that

428
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,540
the driver was not the one who broke the car.

429
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,540
She cheated on the driver

430
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,540
and the driver did it.

431
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,540
Miss,

432
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,540
this is the kind of person

433
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,540
who should be locked up.

434
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,540
Boss, what's the matter?

435
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,540
You're going to get a good look.

436
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,540
I'm warning you.

437
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,540
Although you have a lawyer at the scene,

438
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,540
you can add another crime

439
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,540
if you're afraid of being a witness.

440
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,540
Miss,

441
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,540
this guy is a witness.

442
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,540
So it's okay for you

443
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,540
to have a relationship with this guy.

444
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,540
And you can sue him for being a criminal.

445
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,540
No, I just want to leave.

446
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,540
If you want to kill He,

447
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,540
you can do it.

448
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,540
But

449
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,540
please take this as a token

450
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,540
of the people who waste their time

451
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,540
and give him a lesson.

452
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,540
Yes, let's teach him a lesson.

453
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,540
Yes,

454
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,540
he should be punished

455
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,540
for his selfishness.

456
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,540
He should be punished for his selfishness.

457
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,540
You're so stupid.

458
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,540
You're going to be a criminal now.

459
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,540
You're deaf.

460
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,540
You're not listening to them.

461
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,540
You're so serious.

462
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,540
You'd better accept it.

463
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,540
It's me.

464
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,540
Do you know who's in the police?

465
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,540
It's the law enforcement officer.

466
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,540
I'll show you.

467
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,540
What are you taking?

468
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,540
You can take the photo.

469
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,540
Give me the card.

470
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,540
Give me your phone.

471
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,540
Give me your phone.

472
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,540
You're so busy.

473
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,540
You haven't got your phone back yet.

474
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,540
Give me your phone.

475
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,540
Don't touch the car.

476
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,540
These guys again.

477
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,540
You're so stupid.

478
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,540
Remember this.

479
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,540
No more.

480
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,540
What do you mean?

481
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,540
You're going to run away.

482
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,540
Listen,

483
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,540
this fish is important.

484
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,540
If not,

485
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,540
we'll be dead.

486
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,540
It's too late.

487
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,540
Let's go back to the old school.

488
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,540
Go to the bathroom and wash the dishes.

489
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,540
Don't come to school.

490
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,540
You're going to be a criminal.

491
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,540
Don't be so serious.

492
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,540
You're so stupid.

493
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,540
You're so stupid.

494
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,540
You're so stupid.

495
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,540
You're so stupid.

496
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,540
You're so stupid.

497
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,540
You're so stupid.

498
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,540
You're so stupid.

499
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,540
You're so stupid.

500
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,540
You're so stupid.

501
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,540
You're so stupid.

502
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,540
Don't be angry.

503
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,540
I'll find a way

504
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,540
to get you another fish.

505
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,540
Go now!

506
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,540
Go!

507
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,540
Come on.

508
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,540
Come on.

509
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,540
You're so handsome.

510
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,540
Boss.

511
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,540
Yes.

512
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,540
Please excuse me.

513
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,540
What?

514
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,540
Don't use such high-quality materials.

515
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,540
Don't make a scene

516
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,540
for the chairman.

517
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,540
Of course.

518
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,540
This is great.

519
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,540
The biggest thing in school

520
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,540
is the chairman.

521
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,540
Who do you want to be the model?

522
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,540
The chairman has a deal.

523
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,540
He said he likes to eat

524
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,540
steamed rice with steamed eggs.

525
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,540
He wants to take this opportunity

526
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,540
and perform.

527
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,540
He doesn't want to be the chairman.

528
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,540
You're the chairman.

529
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,540
You've worked hard

530
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,540
to make this for Mo Chen.

531
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,540
You've done this for him.

532
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,540
Mo Chen's stall is closed now.

533
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,540
Come and have a look.

534
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,540
You can't cut this.

535
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,540
You'll get a cold.

536
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,540
Right.

537
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,540
Mo Chen.

538
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,540
You're so good at cooking.

539
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,540
You're so good at cooking.

540
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,540
Hurry up.

541
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,540
I have your clean clothes.

542
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,540
Go and change.

543
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,540
Go change.

544
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,540
I'll go change.

545
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,540
No need.

546
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,540
It's troublesome.

547
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,540
Go and change.

548
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,540
This is not for people.

549
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,540
Don't be afraid of being stolen.

550
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,540
Hurry up.

551
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,540
Go and change.

552
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,540
Otherwise, you'll be in trouble.

553
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,540
Who are you?

554
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,880
I'm Vivian, Valentines Day

555
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,360
Who are you?

556
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,540
Hello, I'm the first-class cook at the school.

557
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,540
I'm the first-class chef at the school.

558
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:20,540
Director, the ball game is going well.

559
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:25,540
It's been a while since I've made an appointment with the Huanyu Construction.

560
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,540
I'd like to talk about the problem of the ball game.

561
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,540
I didn't expect him to let me go.

562
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:37,540
He's forcing me to play the game.

563
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,540
Go get the kitchen.

564
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,540
Get the heat out.

565
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,540
Mom, this is so hard.

566
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:57,540
It turns out that Xiao Ling is in a very serious situation.

567
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,540
She's playing the golf.

568
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,540
I'm going to discuss the major cooperation with He Dong.

569
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,540
What? Ice water?

570
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,540
I'm going to go get the water.

571
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,540
You're really in a serious situation.

572
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:22,540
You've got more important data than your son's.

573
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,540
If you don't play golf all day,

574
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:29,540
I won't care if I have to protect you.

575
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:35,540
I'm not going to be like the guy who's been taking care of you.

576
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,540
I'm afraid of the world.

577
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,540
I didn't expect you to learn the music.

578
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,540
You've learned a lot from the embarrassing things.

579
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,540
I don't care what you say.

580
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,540
But I don't allow you to say that, Dad.

581
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,540
Xiao Ling, what's your crime this time?

582
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:02,540
Is it a super-speed, a long-distance, a violent threat,

583
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,540
or a defense check?

584
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,540
President, there's no such thing as a relationship.

585
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,540
There's no such thing as a relationship.

586
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,540
This is a car.

587
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,540
It's safe to defend the public.

588
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,540
It's a five-hour labor service.

589
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,540
But you're used to it.

590
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,540
It's not painful.

591
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,540
What's wrong with Zhang Dong?

592
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,540
Why did he owe you?

593
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:36,540
He told me you humiliated him in the public.

594
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,540
Why did a good girl do that to him?

595
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,540
You should ask yourself this.

596
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,540
Don't forget that you taught me this.

597
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,540
A woman's feelings are so weak.

598
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,540
President, the dishes are ready.

599
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,540
And you can have your favorite dish.

600
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,540
I'm not eating. I'll take them away.

601
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,540
They're so expensive.

602
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,540
They're so expensive.

603
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,540
You're just my lawyer.

604
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,540
You're not my guardian.

605
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,540
Why are you still here?

606
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,540
I'll bring him back for you.

607
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,540
Please.

608
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,540
If you know you're not giving up,

609
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,540
he'll be happy.

610
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,540
You're my dream.

611
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,540
It's not mine.

612
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,540
You're so mean.

613
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:17,540
Desperate to study

614
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:31,900
Drawing сы there Canada

615
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:41,100
Today, Hua Yi marked all principle

616
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,100
We use the knot

617
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,100
And the rose

618
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,100
We tie them together

619
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:54,100
We treat flowers like women

620
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:58,100
We treat them warmly and respect them

621
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:02,100
Or they might get hurt

622
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:07,100
Let them feel your love for them

623
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:11,100
They will be grateful to you

624
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,100
Good job

625
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,100
No, I can't stand it

626
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:48,100
The rose is so beautiful

627
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,100
The flower is so beautiful

628
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:55,100
But how can you make such a beautiful flower?

629
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,100
What is this?

630
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,100
It's so beautiful

631
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:06,100
It's so beautiful

632
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,100
Look, it's a cotton

633
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,100
You're not a cotton

634
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:16,100
Do you know where the flower is?

635
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,100
Where is it?

636
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,100
It's in the kitchen

637
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,100
You brat, what are you doing?

638
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,100
You don't even know how to use the flower

639
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,100
Do you know why I use the knot?

640
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,100
Do you know why I use the knot?

641
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,100
Because the knot represents a firm spirit

642
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,100
It's not a love

643
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,100
Do you understand?

644
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,100
I understand

645
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,100
Brother Jiang has never thought of you

646
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,100
You're so hardworking and tall

647
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,100
You're so good at drawing

648
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,100
You're so good at drawing

649
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,100
You're the oldest student in the university

650
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,100
You're so persistent

651
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,100
Your parents taught you to respect flowers

652
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,100
Yes, they taught me to respect flowers

653
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,100
You're so good at drawing

654
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,100
You're so good at drawing

655
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,100
You're so good at drawing

656
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,100
Mr. A Tuo

657
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,100
You're finally here

658
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,100
It's the eldest sister

659
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,100
Mr. A Tuo

660
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,100
Mr. A Tuo

661
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,100
Hello

662
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,100
You're wearing a flower suit

663
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:34,100
Yes, we're shooting a tie-up with the group

664
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,100
Are you done?

665
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,100
Not yet

666
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,100
We're going to shoot again

667
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,100
What's wrong?

668
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,100
Of course we're going to shoot again

669
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,100
You haven't even worn your clothes yet

670
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,100
You're going to wear this dress to treat him seriously

671
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,100
Okay

672
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,100
Okay

673
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,100
Don't you think he wears a dress like this?

674
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,100
No, he wears a flower suit

675
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,100
He treats his work seriously

676
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,100
He wears a dress to treat his work seriously

677
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,100
He wears a dress to treat his work seriously

678
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,100
And the man in the suit is the most handsome

679
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,100
Unlike the guy I met in the studio today

680
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,100
He's a selfish and selfish guy

681
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,100
He's still the son of a college teacher

682
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,100
How can he be so selfish?

683
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,100
Forget it. I don't want to be his friend

684
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,100
You're taking it?

685
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,100
Thank you

686
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,100
What do you mean?

687
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,100
I want to thank you

688
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,100
Thank you for teaching us so many things

689
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,100
And you also helped me to the library

690
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,100
I'm ready to go to the college

691
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,100
I forgot to talk to you

692
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,100
I'm here to give you the English book

693
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,100
I...

694
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,100
What's wrong?

695
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,100
It's okay

696
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,100
You two are together

697
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,100
I'm here to give you the English book

698
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,100
I...

699
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,100
What's wrong?

700
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,100
It's okay

701
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,100
It's okay

702
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,100
You two are together

703
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,100
I'm here to give you the English book

704
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,100
I...

705
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,100
I...

706
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,100
I...

707
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,100
I...

708
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,100
I...

709
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,100
I...

710
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,100
I...

711
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,100
I...

712
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,100
I...

713
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,100
It's okay if you two are together

714
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,100
What do you mean?

715
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,100
You can't lend the books to anyone else

716
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,100
You've helped me to lend them

717
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,100
I'll get rid of the books if I get back

718
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,100
I'll go and find them. Wait for me

719
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,100
Mo...Mu Chen

720
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,100
Let's go

721
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,100
This way

722
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,100
Yes, yes

723
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,100
Let's go

724
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,100
This is called a knot

725
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,100
It's very heavy

726
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,100
I'll give it to you

727
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,100
Thank you

728
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:58,100
The meaning of a knot is not to be loved

729
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,100
You can't forget that book

730
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,100
I must find it

731
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,100
Thank you

732
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,100
Bye

733
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,100
You're so good at fighting

734
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,100
You're so good at drawing

735
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,100
Why are you so good at talking?

736
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,100
If you just give me the book

737
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,100
and help me borrow it

738
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,100
Mo Chen will leave

739
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,100
If you don't say anything

740
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,100
I'll chase you when I'm old

741
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,100
Really?

742
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,100
You know what?

743
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,100
You're the most popular girl in the world

744
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,100
You're already a famous girl

745
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,100
You're so conservative

746
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,100
How can you chase me when I'm old?

747
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,100
You're so mean

748
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,100
You're so stupid

749
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,100
My god

750
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:42,100
Look at how smart Mo Chen is

751
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:46,100
How can he be a man who can't be beaten?

752
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,100
And

753
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,100
As long as I'm here

754
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,100
I'll find it

755
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,100
Who dares to touch it?

756
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,100
All of it

757
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,100
One by one

758
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,100
Big Boss

759
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,100
Are you going to the police station?

760
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,100
What police station?

761
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,100
I've been here for a long time

762
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,100
I'll go and take a shower

763
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,100
I'm going to the police station

764
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,100
I'll go and take a shower

765
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,100
I'll go and take a shower

766
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,100
I'll go and take a shower

767
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,100
I'll go and take a shower

768
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,100
I'll go and take a shower

769
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,100
I'll go and take a shower

770
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,100
I'll go and take a shower

771
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,100
I'll go and take a shower

772
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,100
I'll go and take a shower

773
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,100
I'll go and take a shower

774
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,100
I'll go and take a shower

775
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,100
I'll go and take a shower

776
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,100
I'll go and take a shower

777
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,100
I'll go and take a shower

778
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,100
I'll go and take a shower

779
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,100
Ah-Nai, you're still in the kitchen?

780
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,100
You're awake?

781
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,100
Dad

782
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,100
Ah-Nan

783
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,100
I just saw a big mouse

784
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,100
Big mouse?

785
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,100
How big is it?

786
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,100
It's huge

787
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,100
It's huge

788
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,100
You're so stupid

789
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,100
You're not the tallest in Shenzhen University

790
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,100
Now you're the tallest in the dormitory

791
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,100
You're going to catch it tomorrow

792
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,100
If you scare him, it's fine

793
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,100
If I get him out tomorrow, what will I do?

794
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,100
Shenzhen University is mine

795
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,100
I told you, go to the restaurant

796
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,100
Don't open the restaurant

797
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,100
I don't care

798
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,100
You go and catch it tomorrow

799
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,100
I'm not afraid of anything

800
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,100
I'm afraid of the mouse

801
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,100
Here

802
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,100
I'm finally here to avenge you

803
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,100
Bai Ping is trying to get rid of him

804
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,100
Shenzhen University is a great man

805
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,100
I'm going to...

806
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,100
Yes, the hospital

807
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,100
The hospital is in the service

808
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,100
I'll get the medical certificate

809
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,100
I should have read it earlier

810
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,100
It's hard to lie to a three-year-old boy

811
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:59,100
What kind of national trade plan?

812
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,100
I don't have any achievements

813
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,100
I suggest you to pick up the pretty ones

814
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,100
and fall into their hearts

815
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,100
Because they don't have them

816
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,100
Take the phone

817
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,100
and change the card

818
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,100
If it's not enough,

819
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,100
I'll take it as a fake student

820
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,100
Thank you, President

821
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,100
Bye

822
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,100
Thanks for your help

823
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,100
Or we'll bet again

824
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,100
It's the last time

825
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,100
He's trying to help you achieve your goal

826
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,100
You've been criticized by the 7th grader

827
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,100
I guess you must feel bored

828
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,100
I'm telling you

829
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,100
There's a new product in the school

830
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:47,100
The pretty ones are different from the ZYD

831
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:50,100
No one wants it

832
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,100
I don't know how much it's worth

833
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,100
How about it?

834
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:57,100
I'll send you the photos

835
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:00,100
and we'll share the fake mask

836
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,100
If you have time, come to the club

837
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,100
If you have time, come to the club

838
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,100
If you have time, come to the club

839
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,100
I've already picked up the phone

840
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,100
The senior from the top of the class

841
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,100
will come to the club

842
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,100
I'll let you continue to study

843
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,100
The report of the exam tomorrow

844
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,100
3 points for sure

845
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,100
I'll take the phone

846
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,100
The report is so expensive

847
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,100
You're going to take the B

848
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,100
You don't even have a class

849
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,100
If you take the A,

850
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,100
you'll be able to get the professor's approval

851
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,100
But I remember

852
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,100
I didn't take the B

853
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,100
I can take the B

854
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,100
Sorry

855
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,100
I can't write anything so complicated

856
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:43,100
The B report is my limit

857
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,100
You don't want to graduate

858
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,100
But I've already done my job

859
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,100
You can't be a loser

860
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,100
Okay

861
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,100
Come here

862
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,100
You can't miss a girl

863
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,100
Here

864
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,100
How hard is it tool with your high score

865
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,100
How can you get the girls's approval

866
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,100
to make a right

867
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,100
Sorry

868
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,100
I think I'm the flagship club captain

869
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:19,100
Nanuo

870
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,100
Where are you going?

871
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,100
Unfortunately, my mouth clear

872
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,100
didn't tell me he's sorry right?

873
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,360
Where's the

874
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,200
任望奇 in School of suppliers?

875
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:31,960
I can't tell.

876
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,840
It seems he can hear your sister

877
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,960
wrote down your error.

878
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:38,120
learn about how they made

879
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,260
for the rest of the red card.

880
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:41,880
What should we do?

881
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,220
Do you know着摔推

882
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,100
不安撒

883
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,500
This all seems prepared.

884
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,480
Feel that lightly right about now?

885
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,100
Good, OK.

886
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:59,100
That's right.

887
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,280
If you abandon me by glowing suddenly,

888
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:06,060
I will confess my crime to you.

889
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,380
I can't let you be alone.

890
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:10,340
Go away.

891
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:12,980
But if you understand,

892
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,020
my heart's tell me what to do.

893
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,380
Love isime.

894
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,140
I will teach you

895
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:22,120
First,

896
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,840
You're way more powerful than a gun.

897
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,200
Her momASTRINED.

898
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,700
He's a bastard!

899
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,700
Captain, don't move.

900
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,700
I heard he's a very bad lawyer.

901
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,700
Even if Ren Guangxi bought us,

902
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,700
he might not be the one.

903
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,700
That's right.

904
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:07,700
A lawyer who is so hard to be a lawyer in the future

905
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,700
in the Saint-Denis University,

906
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,700
who doesn't know that his mother and lawyer

907
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,700
are very close?

908
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,700
I didn't expect that the president of Saint-Denis University

909
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,200
would be a man

910
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,700
besides the school.

911
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,200
The president of Saint-Denisd'

912
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,500
LOL

913
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:30,200
None of us can find Ren Guangxi.

914
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,200
At Saint-Denis University,

915
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,200
who didn't know his mother and lawyer

916
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:52,200
I was very close to the president of Shenzhen University

917
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:55,200
Besides being a classmate, he's quite good at making men

918
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,200
What are you doing?

919
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,200
Do you know what I did?

920
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,200
What did you do?

921
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,200
You're crazy!

922
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,200
You reminded me

923
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,200
I'm in the hospital, I'm sick

924
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,200
I can record all the evidence

925
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,200
So I'll give you a word

926
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,200
I can tell you the truth

927
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,200
about the evidence

928
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,200
Let me tell you the truth

929
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,200
Don't play with me

930
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,200
Zheng Guangxi, you're crazy!

931
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,200
I'll give you a face!

932
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,200
I'm asking you to do it today

933
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,200
It's hard for you to be here

934
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,200
Zhu Dazhi, you're leaving with us

935
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,200
You still have to stay and play with them

936
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,200
I'm sorry

937
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:02,200
Dad, why am I so bad at singing?

938
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:06,200
I'm not a dad's son

939
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,200
Dad sings so well

940
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,200
I'm like a dad

941
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,200
It's not your fault

942
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,200
You're playing piano

943
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,200
You're a devil

944
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,200
How could you be a devil?

945
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,200
No, I'm not

946
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,200
This is the song of the 8th place

947
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,200
This is the song of the 8th place

948
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,200
Remember that

949
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,200
I'm not your servant

950
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,200
I'll leave this house

951
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,200
I'll do anything for you

952
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,200
You think you're a real artist?

953
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,200
You've got everything you need

954
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:02,200
From today on, you don't need to endure it

955
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,200
You've been fired

956
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,200
In the university, no one knows

957
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,200
that his mother and lawyer are very close

958
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,200
I didn't expect the president of the university

959
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,200
to be a man

960
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,200
What's going on?

961
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,200
Dad

962
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,200
I'm a real artist

963
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,200
I'm sure I know what to do

964
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,200
This is the scene where I found the hero

965
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,200
I'm already so old

966
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,200
When will you tell me?

967
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,200
You won't have anyone

968
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,200
on this piano

969
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,200
Look at this song

970
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,200
How do you explain this?

971
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,200
The students of the university told you

972
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,200
that you were in the bar and you were hurt

973
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,200
The evidence is here

974
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,200
The report is that the student is a classmate

975
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,200
So the person who was punished is him

976
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,200
Not us

977
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,200
The student of the university

978
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,200
is a good speaker

979
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,200
I'll say it

980
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,200
Master, how about this time?

981
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,200
Have you ever done it?

982
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,200
I've done it

983
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,200
I think it's better to teach you

984
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,200
everyday

985
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,200
Who's idea is this?

986
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,200
The president or the lawyer?

987
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,200
This is not a report or a class

988
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,200
The student who hasn't been fired for two years

989
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,200
I think it's a bit troublesome

990
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,200
Why don't you give me a chance to talk about it?

991
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,200
It's not troublesome at all

992
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,200
You have to do well

993
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,200
You've been a good student

994
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,200
Who said I wanted to be a student?

995
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,200
Wenping didn't say I wanted to be a student

996
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,200
She's my mum

997
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,200
Don't joke

998
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,200
Come to class

999
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,200
Please go back to the classroom to take the punishment

1000
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,200
Wait, he almost killed someone

1001
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,200
You have to let him go

1002
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,200
The student who was a student

1003
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,200
is not punished

1004
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,200
I'm asking the school to take care of the students

1005
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,200
and the students

1006
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,200
You want me to take care of them?

1007
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,200
Okay, I'll take the first action

1008
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,200
to make you the best student

1009
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,200
Xu Fanguo

1010
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,200
Master Fang, these pictures

1011
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,200
are all fake

1012
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,200
Please take the original picture

1013
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,200
and check the truth

1014
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,200
I've asked

1015
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,200
The original picture is washed

1016
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,200
At least give me a chance

1017
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,200
I've always been supported by the scholarship

1018
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,200
to have my own ideas

1019
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,200
If I were to be accepted,

1020
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,200
I wouldn't be able to apply for the scholarship

1021
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,200
Master, this time,

1022
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,200
I have nothing to do with it

1023
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,200
Why did you go to the club to do that?

1024
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,200
Why did you come with them?

1025
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,200
Right

1026
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:25,200
Xu Fanguo, I'm so disappointed in you

1027
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,200
You have to support your students

1028
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,200
to become the best student

1029
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,200
I have to make a good report

1030
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,200
I won't change it again

1031
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,200
Remember to go to class

1032
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,200
Why did you come to the restaurant?

1033
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,200
I came for your next target

1034
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,200
Didn't I tell you about the pub?

1035
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,200
I heard that the girl here is no longer a father and mother

1036
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,200
Her stepmother and her cousin are studying in the school

1037
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,200
She's working inside

1038
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,200
Although she's only a senior in high school

1039
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,200
I heard that she was a rich and poor girl

1040
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,200
No wonder she's so different

1041
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,200
She's so tall and hard to talk about

1042
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,200
90 yuan

1043
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,200
I heard that you have a lot of expenses

1044
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,200
But please don't say that

1045
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,200
Are you here to eat?

1046
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,200
Or to eat tofu?

1047
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,200
M.S.N.

1048
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,200
Don't tell me M.S.N.

1049
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,200
You're so interested in me

1050
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,200
It's impossible to tell me M.S.N.

1051
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,200
I'm not a teacher

1052
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,200
You're going to eat with me

1053
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,200
You're so annoying

1054
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,200
Uncle Cai, that's the guest

1055
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,200
What guest? We're selling vegetables

1056
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,200
Not selling vegetables

1057
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,200
You're so mean

1058
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,200
It's him

1059
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,200
The new product of this month

1060
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,200
The famous student restaurant's female guest

1061
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,200
He's so mean

1062
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,200
I didn't expect that the female guest's name is so interesting

1063
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,200
I'm hungry

1064
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,200
70 yuan

1065
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,200
It's you?

1066
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,200
Why are you here?

1067
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,200
I'm here to eat

1068
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,200
I can't come to my restaurant

1069
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,200
So you're selling 75 yuan?

1070
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,200
The service here is so poor

1071
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:49,200
I've never been here to help

1072
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:53,200
It seems that I can only be a guest

1073
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,200
What would you like to eat?

1074
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,200
Beef noodles, fried eggs and fried rice

1075
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,200
Or do you want a business lunch?

1076
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,200
I heard that you only came to school for 7 days

1077
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,200
And you've already refused 7 requests

1078
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,200
You're the one who thinks you're a romantic girl

1079
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,200
You look innocent and innocent

1080
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,200
I can't imagine that you were in the police station

1081
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,200
And you were supposed to be the one to talk to me

1082
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,200
Don't you think that you're so mean?

1083
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:29,200
Do you really have to apologize to people who want to chase after you?

1084
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,200
I didn't mean to push you

1085
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,200
It's just that everyone knows the truth

1086
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:39,200
I refuse to be in love with someone because I don't have time

1087
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,200
I'm not self-reliant

1088
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,200
You've only seen me twice and you think I'm a hypocrite

1089
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,200
Is it because all the girls you know are so hypocrite?

1090
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,200
If you don't want to order a meal, go to the next door

1091
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,200
Many people are waiting for you

1092
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,200
Let me introduce you

1093
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,200
Go to the date with me tomorrow

1094
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,200
What?

1095
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,200
If you don't want to order a meal, go to the next door

1096
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,200
Many people are waiting for you

1097
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,200
I'll introduce you to them

1098
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,200
Thank you

1099
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,200
Go to the date with me tomorrow

1100
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,200
What?

1101
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,200
This is my last chance to give you

1102
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,200
I don't care if you don't want to come

1103
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,200
But don't regret it

1104
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:39,200
Why are you guys doing this to the college?

1105
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,200
I'm the boss here

1106
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,200
I'm the boss

1107
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,200
Get out of here

1108
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,200
My mom opened the school

1109
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,200
You asked me to leave

1110
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,200
I asked my mom to leave

1111
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,200
Who's the boss now?

1112
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,200
The boss

1113
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,200
You're the boss

1114
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,200
This is a classmate

1115
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,200
A classmate

1116
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,200
Sorry, come here

1117
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,200
Don't be angry

1118
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,200
You're so handsome

1119
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,200
Sit down

1120
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,200
What's the manager's order?

1121
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,200
No, no

1122
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,200
Do you want to order a meal?

1123
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,200
Yes, you want to order?

1124
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,200
You have a card

1125
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,200
Okay, pay for it later

1126
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,200
Come on, sit down

1127
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,200
Hurry up

1128
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,200
We'll serve you

1129
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,200
Don't disturb him

1130
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,200
Come on

1131
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,200
Come on, let's go to the back

1132
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,200
I'll help you

1133
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,200
What would you like to order?

1134
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,200
How is it?

1135
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,200
Are you free tomorrow?

1136
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,200
What do you want to eat?

1137
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,200
Living with English

1138
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,200
My book is in there, right?

1139
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,200
Can you give it back to me?

1140
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,200
I've checked it out

1141
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,200
This book is a book called

1142
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,200
The Flower of the Wild

1143
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,200
It's already in the 20th grade

1144
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,200
It just got into the original school

1145
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,200
It was still in the 30th grade of the Tiyu conservative family

1146
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,200
It just got into the school

1147
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,200
It's a book for the library in the library

1148
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:13,200
Do you think it will be opened tomorrow?

1149
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,200
What do you want?

1150
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,200
I've told you

1151
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,200
It's 12 o'clock in the morning

1152
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,200
Don't wait here

1153
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,200
How is it?

1154
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,200
Breakaway

1155
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,200
I'll get his play tomorrow

1156
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,200
It's fake

1157
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:43,200
You'll get the first piece of the book

1158
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,200
You should prepare for the photo

1159
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,200
All the girls in the room

1160
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,200
including her fake mask

1161
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,200
should be taken

1162
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,200
This one

1163
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,200
This one is cute

1164
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,200
It's pretty

1165
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,200
It's beautiful

1166
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,200
Don't believe me

1167
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,200
I'll show you

1168
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,200
It's like a little cutie

1169
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,200
It's not easy to see the guy's eyes

1170
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,200
It's so beautiful

1171
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,200
Look

1172
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,200
It's so pretty

1173
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,200
It's so pretty

1174
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,200
Auntie

1175
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,200
You'll be caught by him

1176
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,200
Don't be so sweet

1177
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,200
I'll sell you a few pieces

1178
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,200
I'll tell you

1179
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,200
I don't want to ruin my life

1180
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,200
I'll sell Mu Teng

1181
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,200
You're a fool

1182
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,200
You sell me a lot

1183
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,200
I'll sell you

1184
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,200
You're not like that

1185
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,200
You're a fool

1186
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,200
Mu Teng

1187
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,200
Put your hand out

1188
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,200
Auntie will help you put on fake oil

1189
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,200
I'll prepare fake oil for you

1190
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,200
It's blue

1191
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,200
It's pretty

1192
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,200
You can put it on yourself

1193
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,200
Don't go to the market tomorrow morning

1194
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,200
I'll take you to the beauty salon

1195
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,200
and settle the hair

1196
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,200
You'll be a good girl

1197
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,200
Auntie will count on you

1198
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,200
Take it back

1199
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,200
Put it on

1200
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,200
Auntie

1201
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,200
We'll just take a book with her

1202
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,200
I'll tell you

1203
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,200
Which man will take the book

1204
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,200
as an excuse

1205
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,200
He's the son of the chairman

1206
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,200
Even if he's the one who's in trouble

1207
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,200
you're still a fool

1208
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,200
Right

1209
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,200
I don't think so

1210
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,200
I don't want to have anything to do with him

1211
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,200
Or I'll ask Auntie to do you a favor

1212
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,200
Okay?

1213
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,200
No matter what you think

1214
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,200
at least don't offend him

1215
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,200
He's the son of the chairman

1216
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,200
If you go to the chairman

1217
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,200
you'll have to close the restaurant

1218
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,200
Besides

1219
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,200
you'll be the one who'll help you get the book

1220
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,200
OK

1221
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,200
What's wrong?

1222
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,200
You're looking forward to my date with me

1223
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,200
I'll take you to your door

1224
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,200
Do you want me to take you out?

1225
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,200
You can give me the book

1226
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,200
Let's go

1227
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,200
You only care about Huatuo.

1228
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,200
You promised me you wouldn't tell her.

1229
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,200
She just wants to help me with the book.

1230
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,200
If you have any questions, you can ask me.

1231
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,200
Please don't go to her trouble.

1232
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,200
You are the one who gave me the name of another man

1233
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,200
when I had a date.

1234
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,200
Do you think your boyfriend is quite good at this?

1235
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,200
How could there be such a person?

1236
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,200
Do you want to make me understand other things?

1237
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,200
What's wrong with you?

1238
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,200
You are not awake.

1239
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,200
Why are you calling me?

1240
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:16,200
Come on.

1241
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,200
Get in the car.

1242
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,200
You want to take the book.

1243
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,200
I'm happy to see how hard you've worked.

1244
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,200
Hurry up.

1245
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:37,200
Get in the car.

1246
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,200
Hurry up.

1247
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,200
Get in the car.

1248
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,200
Hurry up.

1249
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,200
Move your hands.

1250
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,200
Hurry up.

1251
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,200
Pass.

1252
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,200
Go.

1253
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,200
Go.

1254
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,200
Hurry up.

1255
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,200
Get in the car.

1256
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,200
Hurry up.

1257
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,200
Wait.

1258
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,200
Stand still.

1259
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,200
Hurry up.

1260
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,200
What did he eat today?

1261
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,200
He's so close.

1262
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,200
Go.

1263
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,200
Come back.

1264
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,200
He's here.

1265
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,200
Go.

1266
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,200
Go.

1267
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,200
Go.

1268
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:15,200
You're not right, Ren Guangxin.

1269
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:18,200
Don't you usually even move a wave?

1270
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,200
Get up, Ren Guangxin.

1271
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:22,200
Ren Guangxin.

1272
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,200
I'm sorry.

1273
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,200
I need to take a rest.

1274
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,200
Go.

1275
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,200
Go.

1276
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,200
You were fine just now, right?

1277
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,200
I'm not as weak as I am now.

1278
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,200
I haven't recovered yet.

1279
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:14,200
I've apologized to you for this.

1280
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,200
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1281
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:19,200
I was too anxious the other day.

1282
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,200
And I've made a reservation.

1283
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,200
When can you return the book to me?

1284
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,200
I'll give you a call.

1285
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,200
Is it true?

1286
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,200
I asked you to come.

1287
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:36,200
I sincerely want to apologize to you.

1288
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:41,200
Your book,

1289
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:43,200
your fish,

1290
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,200
your time,

1291
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,200
your innocence,

1292
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,200
I'm sorry.

1293
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,200
You don't need to apologize to me.

1294
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,200
It's useless to apologize.

1295
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,200
You lost everything.

1296
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,200
You hurt me or hurt me.

1297
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,200
You can't let time pass by.

1298
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,200
You can't let things go.

1299
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,200
But now that you've apologized to me,

1300
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:20,200
I accept it.

1301
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:24,200
Because it means you're not a bad guy.

1302
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,200
I'm sorry.

1303
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,200
Where are they?

1304
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,200
They're having lunch.

1305
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:54,200
Do you want to have a try?

1306
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,200
No.

1307
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,200
I won't be a problem.

1308
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,200
I'm sorry.

1309
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,200
I'm sorry.

1310
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:03,200
Are you awake?

1311
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,200
Wait.

1312
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:07,200
Don't worry about me.

1313
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,200
I'm fine.

1314
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,200
I'm fine.

1315
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,200
You're holding your hand like this.

1316
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,200
It's very old-fashioned.

1317
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,200
If you put your hand on the fridge,

1318
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,200
it means you're giving it to him.

1319
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,200
I said I would hold your hand.

1320
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,200
It means you'll protect him.

1321
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,200
Don't do it.

1322
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,200
Don't do it.

1323
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,200
Don't do it.

1324
01:09:55,200 --> 01:10:03,200
Love makes us so deep

1325
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,200
but we can't turn into

1326
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:09,200
a higher-ups soul.

1327
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:17,200
Don't ask me.

1328
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:21,200
Just hold me.

1329
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:25,200
Don't love me

1330
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:27,200
because I'm...

1331
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,200
I was just asking you.

1332
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,200
You're afraid of the dangerous thing

1333
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,200
that goes on the fridge.

1334
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,200
You were watching me.

1335
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,200
I was watching you.

1336
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,200
You're hurt.

1337
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:44,200
But this is where I like it.

1338
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:47,200
You're hurt because of the shock.

1339
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,200
I feel like I'm really alive.

1340
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:53,200
I feel like I'm dead.

1341
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,200
Do you know?

1342
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,200
Once he was in the park,

1343
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:04,200
he was hit by a big rock.

1344
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,200
Other than the giant,

1345
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,200
he had a lot of other options.

1346
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:10,200
When everyone was waiting to see him go out,

1347
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,200
he used a giant

1348
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,200
to make a giant hand.

1349
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:18,200
That's the famous giant.

1350
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:24,200
Maybe I'm afraid of my own...

1351
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,200
So this story tells us

1352
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,200
to be careful of those little people

1353
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,200
who are not natural.

1354
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,200
No.

1355
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:32,200
He told me

1356
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,200
that when life is in a difficult situation,

1357
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:37,200
you can complete the most annoying task.

1358
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,200
From now on,

1359
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,200
when I can't hold on,

1360
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,200
I'll think of a few giant songs.

1361
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,200
Now, I'll give half of them to you.

1362
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:48,200
Don't say those words again.

1363
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:58,200
Wow.

1364
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:00,200
Let me see.

1365
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,200
Ok.

1366
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:07,200
You got a guitar?

1367
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,200
When we learn the song,

1368
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:11,200
you learn it up and passed it.

1369
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,200
Moreover,

1370
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,200
we learned that

1371
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,200
we're known fully

1372
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:22,200
I'll hold your hand

1373
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:28,200
One minute, let me still be your dream

1374
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,200
Get off me!

1375
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,200
What are you doing, Mr Hu?

1376
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:35,200
Don't make me angry!

1377
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:38,200
What are you doing?

1378
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:40,200
I'm playing the game with my friend!

1379
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,200
I got you!

1380
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:43,200
This is the photo we took

1381
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:46,200
Get off me!

1382
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,200
Get off me!

1383
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,200
Get off me!

1384
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:51,200
Get off me!

1385
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,200
Where are you going?

1386
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,200
Get off me!

1387
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:57,200
Tuoyue, you came too early

1388
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,200
Don't you know I played gambling with other friends?

1389
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,200
I was playing with this boy

1390
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:05,200
He came to ask me out in a month

1391
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:08,200
He was kissing me in a week

1392
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:10,200
You didn't even look at me

1393
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:12,200
You were cheated so easily

1394
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:16,200
You said I was the best at playing with my friends

1395
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:18,200
I played gambling with other friends

1396
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:23,200
As long as I win, the other friends will buy our meals

1397
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:24,200
What did you say?

1398
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:27,200
I was so stupid to sell myself for the money

1399
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,200
I was so scared to lose for a month

1400
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:33,200
I was so scared to lose like you

1401
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,200
Do you even listen to me?

1402
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:38,200
You're so stupid to cut vegetables and make me lose!

1403
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:42,200
Yes, at least I won the money

1404
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,200
What do you mean?

1405
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:46,200
You don't care too much

1406
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:49,200
Everyone is playing anyway

1407
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,200
That thing for me

1408
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:54,200
It's not just a mouth to mouth

1409
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,200
It won't be a piece of cake

1410
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,200
Do you think so too?

1411
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:02,200
Right, the game is over

1412
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:05,200
What does that mean?

1413
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:12,200
wore glasses

1414
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:13,200
and hung my head

1415
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,200
We can get out in but have a little work

1416
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:22,200
You're going live?

1417
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:23,200
He's scared

1418
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:26,320
Some rice

1419
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,200
Can't she?

1420
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:31,200
She's moving

1421
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,200
Post breaking

1422
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,200
Let me help her

1423
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:37,200
Sorry

1424
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:39,200
You're the son of the chairman. You sleep with him.

1425
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:41,200
You have to say thank you to him.

1426
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:43,200
You still want to talk about love?

1427
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:46,200
Your father has died for so many years. You're dreaming!

1428
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:51,200
Who told you to not be so kind?

1429
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:52,200
Who do you think you are?

1430
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,200
You're like a stranger.

1431
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:55,200
You're heartless.

1432
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,200
Why are you here?

1433
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,200
How can I leave?

1434
01:14:58,200 --> 01:14:59,200
I'm not tired.

1435
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,200
Why are you looking at me like that?

1436
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,200
What are you looking at?

1437
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:08,200
You have to be in front of the man in the tomb to make yourself feel good.

1438
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:15,200
I know that I'm the first to meet a man with a heart that will shed tears.

1439
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,200
Yang Muchen is my last goal.

1440
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:21,200
You can run to your feet and take it as a bet.

1441
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,200
You're very good.

1442
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:25,200
President Fang, I hope I can be friends with you.

1443
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,200
Do you think I'm a successful man?

1444
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:29,200
Who do you think we are?

1445
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,200
Miss Jiu Dian.

1446
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:33,200
The highest chance to judge you is to be a good friend.

1447
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:38,200
You'll be so dead if you get involved with the people who are next to you.

1448
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:41,200
No matter how you sleep, if he dares to do anything to you,

1449
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:42,200
you'll be caught immediately.

1450
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:45,200
I don't believe you don't care about this pervert.

1451
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:48,200
I want you to regret and forget about Zhang Yili.

1452
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:03,200
I'm not a child.

1453
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:06,200
I'm just like a confession to you.

1454
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:09,200
I just want to be loved by you.

1455
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:12,200
Suddenly, I'm in love.

1456
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:15,200
The most greedy person is the confession.

1457
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:18,200
I want to eat the falling dumplings.

1458
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:21,200
I'm comfortable.

1459
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:23,200
I'm used to it.

1460
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,200
I'm used to it.

1461
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:28,200
Suddenly, I understand.

1462
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:31,200
I'm not a child.

1463
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:34,200
I'm just like a confession to you.

1464
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:37,200
I'm not a child.

1465
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:40,200
I'm used to it.

1466
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:43,200
I'm used to it.

1467
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:46,200
I'm used to it.

1468
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:49,200
I'm used to it.

1469
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:52,200
I'm used to it.

1470
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:55,200
I'm used to it.

1471
01:16:55,200 --> 01:17:00,200
It turns out that I can only look forward to it.

1472
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:03,200
I always fall in love.

1473
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:07,200
I want to stay in love.

1474
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:13,200
I should be like this.

1475
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:24,200
I must be in front of the person in the tomb.

1476
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:26,200
How do I look?

1477
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,200
Don't take it off.

1478
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:33,200
I've never met a woman with a real heart that looks a little tired.

1479
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:36,200
This is my last goal.

1480
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:39,200
Ten o'clock every Sunday night.

1481
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,200
Happy next week.
