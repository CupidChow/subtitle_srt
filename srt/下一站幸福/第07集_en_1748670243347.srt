1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Next, I'll broadcast for you the next time

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This beef rice is the most important thing to be served

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Guangxi, you are my most important person

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Actually, his desire can be raised

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But he gave up because of you

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Because he said he didn't want to owe the He family

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
He's guarding you

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Even if he dies, he doesn't care

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What do you want to do?

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I want to make a play

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But this is just a play for Guangxi

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
After he enters the surgery room and receives the anesthesia

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We will immediately do the treatment for him

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
After you wake up

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I have a whole new life

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
After the operation is done

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
How do you think you should report to his father about the recovery?

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
After I wake up

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I will take care of him

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I will eat him

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
When he enters the surgery room

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I will leave Guangxi

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What?

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
If not for him

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I will die

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I will be a fool

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I will chase you

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Stop the car

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What's wrong?

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Let's go

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Let's go

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm so sorry

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Don't move

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Don't move

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Don't move

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Don't move

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Call the ambulance

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You two, wake up

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Don't wake up

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Don't move

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Don't move

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Don't move

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Don't move

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Don't wake up

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Don't wake up

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Don't wake up

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Doctor

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
There is a side-cutting knife

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Be careful of the table

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Doctor, I'm sorry

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Tianye

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Tianye, please save my son

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Please save him

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Please save him

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Please save him

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Don't move

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Tianye

58
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You are too fast

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Don't move

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Don't move

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Don't move

62
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Don't move

63
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Don't move

64
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Don't move

65
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Don't move

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Don't move

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Don't move

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Don't move

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Don't move

70
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Don't move

71
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Don't move

72
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Don't move

73
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Don't move

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We don't belong here

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The first murderer

76
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The victim

77
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,960
Ka Si.

78
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,960
Guan Shi,

79
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,580
are you awake?

80
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm not afraid of the wind.

81
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm afraid of the rain.

82
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm afraid of the wind.

83
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm afraid of the rain.

84
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm afraid of the wind.

85
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm afraid of the rain.

86
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm afraid of the wind.

87
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm afraid of the rain.

88
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm afraid of the rain.

89
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm afraid of the rain.

90
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm afraid of the rain.

91
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm afraid of the rain.

92
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm afraid of the rain.

93
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm afraid of the rain.

94
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Meixiao.

95
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Dad.

96
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Are you back?

97
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Can you go back?

98
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Dad.

99
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Meixiao.

100
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Meixiao.

101
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Dad.

102
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Can you go back?

103
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Can you go back?

104
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Dad.

105
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Meixiao.

106
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Meixiao.

107
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Meixiao.

108
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Meixiao.

109
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Meixiao.

110
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Meixiao.

111
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Meixiao.

112
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Mom.

113
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm not afraid of the wind.

114
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm afraid of the rain.

115
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
My kids don't understand.

116
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
They want to go to the fire.

117
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm afraid of the wind.

118
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,200
So, is Xiaoyue's dad a fire star?

119
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,200
No, my mom said that dad is the most lucky person to play the game.

120
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,900
He works hard, and sometimes he runs to a fire star, sometimes to a water star.

121
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,700
He often changes the location of the car.

122
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,000
So, dad can find me.

123
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Good, you have a fire star dad.

124
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,200
I also want to have one.

125
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,000
There's no way.

126
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,900
You have to play the game of water.

127
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,500
Dad is not a foreign child.

128
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,000
Then, can I just play the game of water?

129
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,500
No, my mom said that if you play the game of water, he can play the game of water.

130
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,600
Other people play the game of water, they will be so noisy.

131
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,700
Even my mom can't play.

132
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,100
But, he doesn't want to play the game of water, dad will pick him up.

133
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,600
He will play the game of water.

134
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,500
It's okay, he will bring you here.

135
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,200
Sounds good

136
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,300
If you are thinking about the little kid,

137
00:09:53,300 --> 00:10:00,860
keep talking and talking with

138
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,300
My dad Landes sent you this.

139
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,200
Isn't it beautiful?

140
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:17,920
but outstanding inununent

141
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,560
Every time I sleep in my mom's room,

142
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,560
I want to listen to Daddy's singing

143
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,480
When I look like this,

144
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,480
it helps me out

145
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,400
Really?

146
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,680
Yes

147
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,520
And

148
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,760
If you say that you listen to your dad,

149
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,160
he will sleep early like this.

150
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
Your dad is so weird.

151
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,360
His dad is weird

152
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,720
so he will give birth to two idiots.

153
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,200
He is not an idiot.

154
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,400
He will do the design.

155
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,200
I like to pick him up.

156
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,040
Idiot.

157
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,800
This is not a new thing.

158
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,960
Who said that?

159
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,400
My dad said that.

160
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,600
That's because you don't have a dad.

161
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,240
So your mom will lie to you.

162
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,040
Go.

163
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,800
Go.

164
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,520
Don't play with him.

165
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,920
Or you will be like a girl.

166
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,160
Leave me alone.

167
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,480
Leave me alone.

168
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,440
My dad is being bitten by you.

169
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,120
How can you do this?

170
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,560
Idiot.

171
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,240
That's why he is angry.

172
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,760
What are you doing?

173
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,600
Go away.

174
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,120
Uncle,

175
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,920
flowers are so big.

176
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,800
I am a flower.

177
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,160
I am talking about you.

178
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,520
You are so tall.

179
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,680
How can you bully people?

180
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,160
Look at me.

181
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,000
Your dad is so nice to you.

182
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Why can't you bully Luo Xiao?

183
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,880
Dad.

184
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,920
His dad is going to the hospital for the surgery.

185
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,680
He said he doesn't have a dad.

186
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,640
Who said he doesn't have a dad?

187
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,960
I am his dad.

188
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,880
Idiot.

189
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,640
He said his dad is an outsider.

190
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,400
You are not his outsider.

191
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,240
I am his dad on the earth.

192
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,000
So when his outsider dad comes back,

193
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,880
I will be the one to take care of him.

194
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,080
I said you.

195
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,240
If you bully our Xiao Le again,

196
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,000
I will...

197
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,440
I will...

198
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,920
Hua Hong.

199
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,760
Do you see this person?

200
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,280
Do you know what this is?

201
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,400
Don't run.

202
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,640
Don't move.

203
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,880
Be careful.

204
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,000
Bye.

205
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,480
The shadow of the autumn has gone into your head.

206
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,160
Apologize to Xiao Le.

207
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,320
Or else,

208
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,240
when you sleep at night,

209
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,680
he will fall out of your eyes.

210
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,440
He will fall out.

211
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,760
I am afraid.

212
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,800
He will fall into your mouth.

213
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,960
Then,

214
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,920
fall into your cage.

215
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,840
When you find a cage,

216
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,880
he will fall down.

217
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,800
Like a slide.

218
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,120
He will fall down.

219
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,040
Then he will feel hungry.

220
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,160
Then he will find your belly.

221
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,840
So big and fat.

222
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,720
So much meat.

223
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,520
He will start to eat.

224
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,360
He will eat.

225
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,600
Then you will...

226
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,360
You will feel very hungry.

227
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,240
Then you will...

228
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,400
You will...

229
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,240
Uncle Gui, I won't change.

230
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,400
Hurry and get the super shadow out.

231
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,720
I don't want to live like this.

232
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,680
Okay.

233
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,200
Then, are you going to tell Xiao Le

234
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,800
something?

235
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,200
Xiao Le is sorry.

236
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,280
I am sorry.

237
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,960
Good boy.

238
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,840
Come on.

239
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,920
Don't move.

240
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,800
Don't move.

241
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,320
Let's turn the shadow out.

242
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,520
Don't move.

243
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,760
The shadow of the autumn has gone out.

244
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,720
Come on.

245
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,520
Ta-da.

246
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,640
Okay.

247
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,600
The shadow has gone out.

248
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,120
It's okay.

249
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,160
I want to go back and tell my dad

250
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,600
to teach him how to play the game.

251
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,480
Oh, my god.

252
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,760
You little brat.

253
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,240
Be careful.

254
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
Ta-da.

255
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,320
Go to the water.

256
00:13:59,320 --> 00:13:59,920
Yes.

257
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,600
With this,

258
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,360
you won't have a fat face.

259
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,240
Listen.

260
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,680
This is to say you cut it.

261
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,680
Do you know?

262
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,480
Do you remember?

263
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,760
This is cut.

264
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,600
This is super heavy.

265
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,640
Yes.

266
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,040
It means this is cut.

267
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,720
Then,

268
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,160
you can tell your mom

269
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,960
to take the gift.

270
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,000
This is my cut.

271
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,840
Okay.

272
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,800
It's actually my big brother.

273
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,720
So smart.

274
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,800
Xiao Le, come on.

275
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,000
I am asking you.

276
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,240
I am asking you.

277
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,280
Why can't I be your dad?

278
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,080
No matter what,

279
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,880
I was the first to report you.

280
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,120
No.

281
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,200
You are my big brother.

282
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,320
You and Mu Chen are very close.

283
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,880
I am very romantic.

284
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,800
Besides...

285
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,400
Besides?

286
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,200
What else?

287
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,360
Your mom told you

288
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,040
to marry Hua Si Xin.

289
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,400
You should not marry Mu Chen

290
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,520
and marry Mu Chen.

291
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,280
My brother is going to die.

292
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,600
How about this?

293
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,080
If I marry Mu Chen,

294
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,640
then Mu Chen will not have to go to the blind date.

295
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,920
Then you don't have to go back.

296
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,560
Right?

297
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,400
Hua Si Xin is going to marry you.

298
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,240
She is going to marry Mu Chen.

299
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,080
No.

300
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,880
Let go of the move.

301
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,920
Xiao Le,

302
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,760
do you hear...

303
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,600
I heard something.

304
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
My neck hurts.

305
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
What is it?

306
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,760
Go to the blind date.

307
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,160
Mu Chen is going home today.

308
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,560
He is so shy.

309
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,840
Yes.

310
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,880
Let's go.

311
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,840
I am going to the blind date.

312
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,840
I am going to the blind date.

313
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,840
I am going to the blind date.

314
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,840
I am going to the blind date.

315
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,840
I am going to the blind date.

316
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,840
I am going to the blind date.

317
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,840
I am going to the blind date.

318
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,840
I am going to the blind date.

319
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,840
I am going to the blind date.

320
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,840
I am going to the blind date.

321
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,840
I am going to the blind date.

322
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,840
I am going to the blind date.

323
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,840
I am going to the blind date.

324
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,840
I am going to the blind date.

325
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,840
I am going to the blind date.

326
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,840
I am going to the blind date.

327
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,840
I am going to the blind date.

328
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,840
Hey, Mu Chen.

329
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,840
These,

330
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,840
the evidence that you have recorded

331
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,840
are the proof on my behalf.

332
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,840
When do you want to捕 the evidence?

333
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,840
Boss Hua,

334
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,840
I am sorry.

335
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,840
I took in a lot of credit.

336
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,840
Next month,

337
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,840
I will try my best to do this

338
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,840
You are so stupid

339
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,840
I don't know how busy you are

340
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,840
You have to send me milk every day

341
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,840
You have to work as a secretary in the village

342
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,840
to organize the materials

343
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,840
You have to do handwork and take care of Xiao Le

344
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,840
You are so talented

345
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,840
When you are done with the farm

346
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,840
you will have no time

347
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,840
Don't mention it

348
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,840
You have to wait for your salary

349
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,840
when you have time

350
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,840
When you have time

351
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,840
I will give you a good time

352
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,840
How about a quick and convenient way?

353
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,840
A quick and convenient way?

354
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,840
You are a rich man

355
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,840
I have to take care of a few things

356
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,840
I want to be a secretary

357
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,840
You have to take care of a rich man

358
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,840
who is rich and rich

359
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,840
Don't be too proud

360
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,840
I tell you

361
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,840
If you want to be rich and rich

362
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,840
you have to take care of a rich man

363
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,840
I tell you

364
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,840
He is now a president of the village

365
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,840
He is the chief executive of the village

366
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,840
Look at him

367
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,840
He is so smart

368
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,840
He is so smart

369
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,840
Hua Ying

370
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,840
Miss Qing, why are you here?

371
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,840
No, I am here to pick up the money

372
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,840
My father is very smart

373
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,840
I pick it up

374
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,840
Mr. Hua

375
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,840
You have to come to the company with Mu Cheng Tao

376
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,840
You are not allowed to come

377
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,840
I am busy

378
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,840
It's a good thing to talk about this company

379
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,840
I just said

380
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,840
Excuse me

381
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,840
I am leaving

382
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,840
Mr. Hua, goodbye

383
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,840
What's wrong?

384
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,840
Mr. Hua, you are a rich man

385
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,840
You have to take care of a few things

386
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,840
You know, the boss and the boss

387
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,840
are very good friends

388
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,840
He is very smart

389
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,840
He is very smart

390
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,840
He is very smart

391
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,840
He is very smart

392
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,840
He is now a president of the village

393
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,840
He is very smart

394
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,840
I am telling you

395
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,840
He is very smart

396
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,840
He is very smart

397
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,840
He is very smart

398
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,840
He is very smart

399
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,840
He is very smart

400
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,840
Hua Ying

401
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,840
I didn't think much

402
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,840
I am enough now

403
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,840
What?

404
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,840
Are you sure?

405
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,840
You don't have the idea of hitting Tuo Ye Ge

406
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,840
Miss Qing

407
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,840
I really don't know anything about Tuo Ye

408
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,840
Do you remember my name is Chu Xin?

409
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,840
I am a big fan of Tuo Ye Ge

410
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,840
You even let him help you to pick up the money

411
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,840
I know your job is also in the way

412
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,840
You see him

413
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,840
He is like this

414
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,840
You have to help me to organize the construction

415
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,840
Otherwise, you will be in trouble

416
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,840
Don't help him to help the same-sex marriage

417
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,840
And now, I don't have any business

418
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,840
Miss Qing, don't worry

419
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,840
I will keep your distance from Tuo Ye Ge

420
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,840
Tuo Ye Ge is so sincere

421
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,840
I think if he is not married to you

422
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,840
He will not give up on you

423
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,840
Otherwise

424
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,840
I think you should go to the internet with him

425
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,840
He likes you a lot

426
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,840
Mu Chen

427
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,840
Mu Chen

428
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,840
Mu Chen

429
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,840
I just found you

430
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,840
Tuo Ye Ge

431
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,840
I told you, Mu Chen

432
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,840
I told you to take a look

433
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,840
Don't tell him

434
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,840
Come on

435
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,840
I want to go to the market

436
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,840
But he is so busy

437
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,840
I will go to the market

438
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,840
I will go to the market

439
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,840
You should go to the market

440
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,840
Don't tell him to go to the market

441
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,840
Come on

442
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,840
Mu Chen

443
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,840
What?

444
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,840
What are you looking for?

445
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,840
Mu Chen

446
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,840
I am off work

447
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,840
Mu Chen, I am here to pick you up

448
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,840
You are the happiest

449
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,840
Let's have fun today

450
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,840
Let's go back to the market

451
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,840
Sorry, I am sorry to pick you up

452
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,840
No, let's go back

453
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,840
Let's go to the market

454
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,840
Come on

455
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,840
Be careful

456
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,840
Tuo Ye, you are picking up things again

457
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,840
What is this?

458
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,840
It's a lottery

459
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,840
What is this?

460
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,840
It's a lottery

461
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,840
We don't need anything

462
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,840
Take it home

463
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,840
No, it's really a lottery

464
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,840
Yes, it's really a lottery

465
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,840
I will pick it up

466
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,840
Look, he is so popular

467
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,840
Mu Chen, don't reject this old Tian Tian

468
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,840
He is so kind to the people around him

469
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,840
Take it

470
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,840
Xiao Le, take it

471
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,840
Tuo Ye

472
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,840
Xiao Le, hurry up and take the car

473
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,840
Hurry up

474
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,840
Mu Chen, what are we going to eat tonight?

475
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,840
Beef rice

476
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,840
Beef rice again? I had it yesterday

477
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,840
We didn't finish the food we ate yesterday

478
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,840
And we can't waste it

479
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,840
And beef rice is my best memory dinner with my grandpa

480
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,840
Xiao Le doesn't like it

481
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,840
I want to eat beef rice with dad

482
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,840
Dad, I want to eat beef rice

483
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,840
Dad, I want to eat beef rice

484
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,840
Xiao Le is the best

485
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,840
Since that, I will take Xiao Le to the bath

486
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,840
Xiao Le, let's go to the pool

487
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,840
I will take the water and spray it

488
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,840
I will spray it on you

489
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,840
I will spray it on you

490
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,840
It's okay, I will take him to the bath

491
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,840
I will make you laugh, I am sorry

492
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,840
It's okay, I am Xiao Le's housewife

493
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,840
Right?

494
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,840
Yes

495
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,840
Right, Huatou Ye, do you want to go home?

496
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,840
I think auntie Hua will come to you

497
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,840
How do you know she will come to me?

498
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,840
She will come to you, right?

499
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,840
I don't know, she is talking about those things

500
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,840
She asked me to see her in the car

501
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,840
And I will call her grandson

502
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,840
Don't let her stay here

503
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,840
Don't leave her

504
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,840
Xiao Le

505
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,840
But, mom

506
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,840
Mu Chen, I brought you to this village, right?

507
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,840
So, I am the only family member in Huatian Village

508
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,840
I will take care of you, don't be so angry

509
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,840
Xiao Le, let's go to the bath

510
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,840
Go to the bath

511
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,840
Go to the bath

512
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,840
Go to the bath

513
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,840
Go to the bath

514
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,840
Boss, the cleaning time is almost done

515
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,840
Okay

516
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,840
In order to prevent other farmers from living in cheap 그렇ins

517
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,840
이라는

518
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,840
Boss, the party justice ministerankom你們從他的不同影片的表演要跳出在裡頭

519
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,840
The reporter wrote that the case was filed for years.

520
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,840
The file was handed to the president.

521
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,840
The lawyer just sent the file to the company.

522
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,840
What else?

523
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,840
The reporter also reported your background.

524
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,840
You were a lawyer three years ago.

525
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,840
During your career, you won the case.

526
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,840
The title is

527
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,840
The Lawyer's Wife's Wife's Wife.

528
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,840
You should pay attention to the work behind the government.

529
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,840
The government can't let Xu Kunshan get the money.

530
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,840
Where's the first file?

531
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,840
The lawyer's wife, the boss of the health and health department.

532
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,840
The case is filed.

533
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,840
The case is filed.

534
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,840
The plaintiff is not convinced.

535
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,840
The case is filed on the second day of this afternoon.

536
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,840
The court will make a judgment.

537
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,840
The plaintiff also proposed that the case was filed for evidence.

538
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,840
But the evidence is not enough.

539
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,840
The lawsuit is much simpler than the case.

540
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,840
I think no one can guess that

541
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,840
I was brainwashed by a big operation.

542
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,840
And I was almost bitten.

543
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,840
The court will make a judgment.

544
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,840
Let's announce the case.

545
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,840
You're lying.

546
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:47,840
You said that I was the person who was the boss of the health and health department.

547
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,840
You and your mother worked for two days.

548
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,840
You were so worried about you.

549
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,840
But after your mother left the company,

550
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,840
your mother had moved out to live.

551
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,840
If she bullied you,

552
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,840
you should be afraid of her.

553
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,840
Why did you come to my house

554
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,840
two months ago and have a relationship with her?

555
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,840
That's why you're so greedy.

556
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,840
You're going to go back and seduce her.

557
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,840
Is this a fake news?

558
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,840
No.

559
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,840
She took my things away from me.

560
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,840
That day,

561
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,840
she said she would give me the stolen light.

562
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,840
So I went back.

563
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,840
Otherwise, she would have posted it on the Internet.

564
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,840
But I'm really heartless.

565
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,840
She really bullied me.

566
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,840
Is this a fake news?

567
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,840
Or is it a fake news?

568
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,840
Or is it a fake news?

569
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,840
I don't know.

570
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,840
You don't know?

571
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,840
You don't even know the existence of the light.

572
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,840
You even made the video of me taking the photo of the camera.

573
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,840
You didn't even have the time to control it.

574
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,840
You just had the time to control it.

575
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,840
I'm asking you.

576
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,840
If she bullied you,

577
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,840
why didn't you call the police?

578
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,840
Don't you know that you're going to the hospital

579
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,840
to get the evidence?

580
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,840
I would.

581
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,840
It's because...

582
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,840
If she went to the hospital,

583
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,840
she would hurt my mom.

584
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,840
For the past two years,

585
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,840
I've been avoiding her twice.

586
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,840
Why can't I just make her do it?

587
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,840
This can only prove that you're suspicious.

588
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,840
Avoid her.

589
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,840
But it can't prove that my client is in a bad mood.

590
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,840
The boss said that

591
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,840
you agreed to join her.

592
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,840
It's because you're in a situation

593
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,840
that I don't want to be involved.

594
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,840
From now on,

595
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,840
the fault of your boss is on your love.

596
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,840
Then it's just a marriage.

597
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,840
Nonsense.

598
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,840
Nonsense.

599
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,840
I'm here to

600
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,840
remove my scar.

601
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,840
You can protect my family.

602
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,840
This can only control the mood.

603
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,840
Stop.

604
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,840
The court is a fair game.

605
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,840
You're not a wretch.

606
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,840
You're not a wretch.

607
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,840
You don't think it's enough

608
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,840
to be a big girl.

609
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,840
I didn't expect that I didn't accept it.

610
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,840
So you should be punished.

611
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,840
I don't want money.

612
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,840
You used your body to exchange money.

613
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,840
Then you became a wretch

614
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,840
who would raise your parents.

615
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,840
You're not a wretch.

616
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,840
I don't want the court to give me a justice.

617
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,840
Please don't be a wretch.

618
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,840
I don't have a man's heart.

619
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,840
I deserve my punishment.

620
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,840
I don't.

621
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,840
I've never used anyone.

622
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,840
Why are you so desperate?

623
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,840
Stop.

624
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,840
The police have no concrete evidence

625
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,840
to prove that my client is a criminal.

626
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,840
He can freely enter my client's house

627
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,840
and the court that was on the scene

628
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,840
and show that these evidence are enough to prove

629
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,840
that they are the enemies of your own will.

630
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,840
So the punishment is not fair.

631
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,840
Taiwan is a place of justice.

632
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,840
You can't let someone who is guilty

633
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,840
to commit a crime.

634
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,840
My client is a criminal.

635
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,840
You can't let someone who is guilty

636
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,840
to commit a crime.

637
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,840
My client is a criminal.

638
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,840
He has been in love with your mother

639
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,840
for years.

640
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,840
He won't tell you.

641
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,840
You should be grateful to him.

642
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,840
As for my client,

643
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,840
he has been in a daze

644
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,840
because of his own selfishness.

645
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,840
He has already confessed his guilt.

646
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,840
Please stop.

647
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,840
I hope my client is not guilty.

648
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,840
I'll pay him back.

649
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,840
I'm sorry.

650
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,840
I'm sorry.

651
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,840
You're not guilty.

652
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,840
You're guilty.

653
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,840
You can only cry when you're in a daze.

654
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,840
Why did you wait until the sentence is reached?

655
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,840
Why did you wait until the sentence is reached?

656
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,840
That's normal.

657
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,840
We'll meet again after the sentence is reached.

658
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,840
Take it back.

659
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,840
We're going to the court to report to the defendant.

660
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,840
It's not appropriate for you to talk.

661
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,840
Tell her in court that

662
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,840
he has been in love with my mother

663
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,840
for years.

664
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,840
He won't tell me

665
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,840
to be grateful to her.

666
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,840
Tell her to take it back.

667
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,840
Let's go.

668
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,840
I don't know.

669
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,840
He spent a lot of money on your death.

670
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,840
I just know

671
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,840
that my mother spent her time

672
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,840
helping her at home.

673
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,840
She was so selfish.

674
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,840
She didn't only bully my mother for her studies,

675
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,840
but also my childhood.

676
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,840
She didn't only hurt me,

677
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,840
but also my mother.

678
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,840
What happened to your mother?

679
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,840
She was so weak

680
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,840
that she committed suicide.

681
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,840
She was so ill that she couldn't get a divorce.

682
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,840
She was so stupid

683
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,840
that she destroyed everything.

684
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,840
It's all because of you.

685
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,840
You're just a legal criminal.

686
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,840
You're a criminal.

687
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,840
You don't deserve to be a lawyer.

688
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,840
You can't even be a person!

689
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,840
Listen to me.

690
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,840
Don't go.

691
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,840
I'm scared.

692
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,840
She's unhappy.

693
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,840
She won't find a lawyer.

694
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,840
She'll kick me out.

695
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,840
I don't care if you're upset with her.

696
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,840
But don't be upset with me.

697
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,840
If you don't get over it,

698
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,840
I'll quit this case.

699
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,840
I have something to do.

700
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,840
I'll leave first.

701
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,840
Hello.

702
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,840
Please come to the hotel.

703
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,840
I'm sorry.

704
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,840
I'm sorry.

705
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,840
I just finished my job.

706
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,840
I'm fine.

707
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,840
I just want to see you.

708
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,840
Miss.

709
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,840
Miss.

710
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,840
Miss.

711
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,840
Miss.

712
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,840
Miss.

713
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,840
Miss.

714
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,840
Miss.

715
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,840
Miss.

716
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,840
Miss.

717
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,840
Miss.

718
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,840
Miss.

719
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,840
Miss.

720
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,840
Our little girl is feeling better now.

721
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,840
Has been just legislators.

722
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,840
I'll apply for a Saloon.

723
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,840
Meige procession left the princes first.

724
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,840
He William.

725
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,840
He watched her whole day long.

726
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,840
And met this lady.

727
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,840
She came to rescue him.

728
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,840
I didn't know she lived with him.

729
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,840
She couldn't believe how tough she was.

730
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,840
When did you come?

731
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,840
Good

732
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,840
Daddy is coming

733
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,840
Be careful

734
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,840
Uncle Guanxi, it's you

735
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,840
So annoying

736
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,840
Let's wait for him

737
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,840
This is the chocolate you like to eat

738
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,840
Thank you, Uncle Guanxi

739
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,840
I don't want to hear the story

740
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:34,700
I'll go to the

741
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,840
Little kid's story

742
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,840
It's a good day today

743
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,840
Good boy, get changed

744
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,840
Are you cold?

745
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,840
The doctor doesn't have to worry about the patient's problem

746
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,840
Don't talk about it

747
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,840
I'm asking you, how long are you going to let me wait?

748
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,840
We've been together for six years

749
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:19,840
Last time, you threw my chocolate away for the sake of a doctor

750
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,840
What's the excuse this time?

751
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,840
Take the test and open your mouth

752
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:34,840
I'm here to see the doctor

753
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,840
I'll shut up

754
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,840
What?

755
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,840
You've been up early

756
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,840
You went to the pool, didn't you?

757
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,840
A pasta

758
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,840
A little another hand

759
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,840
Sprinkle the seafood

760
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,840
Did you fall in love with the guy at the comic night

761
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,840
The squint

762
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,840
It's gone

763
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,840
Don't act cute with me.

764
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,840
I told you to play with your big hand.

765
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,840
Now is the final stage of the game.

766
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,840
Don't play with the dangerous sports.

767
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,840
Sorry.

768
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,840
I've been waiting for you.

769
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,840
I didn't have any chance before.

770
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,840
I felt familiar when I played the football.

771
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,840
I was thinking,

772
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,840
maybe it's because you told me

773
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,840
that our first time was at the ice field.

774
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,840
To be honest,

775
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,840
when I was playing football,

776
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,840
I felt like I really lived for 29 years.

777
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,840
But not for this period of 6 years.

778
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,840
Guo Xi,

779
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,840
I'm worried about you.

780
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,840
You hurt your money and your business.

781
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,840
It caused you to lose all the skills you know.

782
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,840
You've been running around

783
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,840
so hard until now.

784
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,840
You finally took back your life.

785
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,840
Now, you're very important to me.

786
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,840
I don't want to lose you again.

787
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,840
I've been losing you all the time.

788
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,840
How could you lose me?

789
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,840
Now, I'm the only one who has a memory of this 6 years.

790
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,840
And I'm the only one who has a memory of this 6 years.

791
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,840
I'm all yours.

792
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,840
If it wasn't for you,

793
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,840
we'd have a good way to get back here.

794
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,840
You saved me.

795
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,840
Guo Xi,

796
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,840
will you still take care of the past memories?

797
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,840
Of course not.

798
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,840
Just like playing the official game,

799
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,840
the most important thing is

800
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,840
to promise the official game.

801
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,840
And my purpose for life now

802
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,840
is to live a good life with you.

803
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,840
I'm very happy now.

804
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,840
I don't need to think about the past.

805
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,840
What about this bracelet?

806
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,840
You always say

807
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,840
that this bracelet means something.

808
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,840
But you can't remember it.

809
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,840
Maybe it's really important.

810
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,840
Maybe it's not important at all.

811
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,840
Why is it important?

812
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,840
Because you told me

813
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,840
that it's my virtual bracelet.

814
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,840
It accompanied me through surgery.

815
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,840
It accompanied me through surgery.

816
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,840
It's you

817
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,840
who took it with me.

818
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,840
I only need to remember these.

819
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,840
The only thing I need to remember is you.

820
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,840
That's enough.

821
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,840
It's cold.

822
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,840
Get ready to sleep.

823
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,840
And get ready to get some water.

824
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,840
No.

825
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,840
No.

826
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,840
No.

827
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,840
No.

828
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,840
Come.

829
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,840
Put your hand out.

830
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,840
Put your hand out.

831
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,840
Put your hand out.

832
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,840
Put your hand out.

833
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,840
Put your hand out.

834
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,840
Put your hand out.

835
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,840
Put your hand out.

836
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,840
I'm going to help Mu Chen blow the hand for Xiao Da.

837
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,840
How many hours can I do it?

838
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,840
It's okay.

839
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,840
It's as brave as Xiao Le.

840
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,840
After Xiao Da helps me blow the hand,

841
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,840
it won't hurt or get itchy.

842
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,840
It won't get itchy.

843
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,840
Mu Chen,

844
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,840
do you want to blow the hand

845
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,840
after I blow it?

846
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,840
Yes.

847
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,840
As long as you live on the earth,

848
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,840
you have to blow the hand.

849
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,840
That's how you get the energy.

850
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,840
Mu Chen.

851
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,840
Wait for me to blow the hand.

852
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,840
I want to blow the hand for Xiao Da.

853
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,840
That's how you get the energy.

854
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,840
Mu Chen.

855
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,840
There are so many things on the earth.

856
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,840
Why do you like aliens?

857
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,840
aliens are the most special.

858
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,840
My eyes are so good.

859
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,840
Of course, I like aliens the most.

860
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,840
Nanjia.

861
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,840
Nanjia.

862
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,840
Give me the story of aliens.

863
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,840
I want to listen to the story of the company.

864
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,840
What are you laughing at?

865
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,840
You still want to listen?

866
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,840
I want to listen to the story of the company.

867
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,840
Please.

868
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,840
Okay.

869
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,840
It's been a long time.

870
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,840
The aliens' father

871
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,840
drove his universe to the earth.

872
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,840
The universe suddenly fell.

873
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,840
He was in front of the car.

874
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,840
The bus driver was about to go home to cook.

875
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,840
So he got off the car

876
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,840
and helped him to fix the car.

877
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,840
Then he fixed it.

878
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,840
His father thought his mother was beautiful and smart.

879
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,840
So he fell in love with his mother.

880
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:35,840
Then he learned my little love.

881
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,840
What happened to Jin Tao?

882
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,840
Why did he think of his father?

883
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,840
He's having beef rice later.

884
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,840
He wants to listen to the story of the company.

885
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,840
Maybe he's the only one who thinks of his father.

886
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,840
I don't know why he thinks of his father.

887
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,840
He's got to listen to the story of the company

888
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,840
when he goes to the market.

889
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,840
Are you sure you don't like the story?

890
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,840
No.

891
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,840
I don't like it.

892
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,840
Do you like the story?

893
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,840
If you don't like it,

894
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,840
Isn't that Hua Hong?

895
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:25,840
She said she didn't have a father.

896
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,340
Miss, she called me Michelle all day.

897
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:40,340
What does that mean?

898
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,340
It's Michelle, right?

899
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,840
I'm not sure.

900
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,840
When will you tell Xiao Le the truth?

901
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:19,840
She will know that her father is not an alien.

902
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:23,840
You know that the star is still alive.

903
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,340
After Xiao Le was born six years ago,

904
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:49,840
you asked me to go to the hospital to find out about her.

905
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:53,640
But even if you know that she succeeded in the operation, what will you do?

906
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,840
Where is she?

907
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:58,840
When Xiao Le was born,

908
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,540
and when she knew that Xiao Le was ill,

909
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:07,640
and you worked until you fell down for Xiao Le's medical expenses,

910
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,940
when these things happened,

911
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:13,540
she should be with you.

912
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:16,840
But six years have passed.

913
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,340
Has she come to find you?

914
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:21,840
Of course, she won't come to me.

915
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,640
I chose to leave her at that time.

916
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,340
When she needed me the most,

917
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:30,540
I was betrayed by her for my trust.

918
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,640
She hated me so much that she couldn't remember.

919
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,340
How could she come to me?

920
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:36,940
But you did all this to save her?

921
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:39,840
Isn't it hard for you to live like this?

922
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,340
Mu Chen,

923
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:49,140
she is Xiao Le's father.

924
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,340
She originally had a will to take care of Xiao Le.

925
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:57,340
Maybe you should let her know Xiao Le's existence.

926
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:02,340
I decided to give Xiao Le the child myself,

927
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:05,340
so she doesn't need to take responsibility for anything.

928
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:11,340
I admit that I once had a bad life.

929
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,840
I was so happy that I could live with her.

930
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,840
But I was so happy that I could live with her.

931
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:21,840
I really want to thank you for bringing us here.

932
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,840
Because Hua Tian Chun is so beautiful,

933
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,840
she is suitable for Xiao Le to grow up here.

934
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,840
Six years have passed,

935
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,840
and I have had many things in the past.

936
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:41,840
Sometimes, I really want to recall those memories.

937
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:46,340
I only realized that those memories have become so far away,

938
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:48,340
so vague.

939
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:57,340
And that person

940
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:01,340
has also disappeared in my life.

941
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,840
But she brought Xiao Le for me.

942
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:08,840
Xiao Le is the only love in my world.

943
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:12,840
She gave me such a good love last time,

944
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,840
so I am so happy.

945
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:18,840
Tuo Yan,

946
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,840
don't think that I am hardworking,

947
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,840
and don't help me anymore.

948
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:24,840
Mu Chen,

949
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,840
I will do this.

950
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:34,840
I just want to help Xiao Le a little more.

951
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,840
We are best friends.

952
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,840
It's not right to help each other.

953
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,840
Is my mom like this?

954
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,840
I didn't say anything about Hua Yi.

955
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,840
But you have helped me a lot.

956
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,840
Just like what you said,

957
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,840
we are friends.

958
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:03,340
Please don't help me out of my friends.

959
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:06,340
Otherwise,

960
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:08,340
I will feel guilty for you.

961
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:11,340
Alright,

962
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:12,340
Hong Wan, you should go back.

963
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:14,340
Otherwise, Hua Yi will be so sad.

964
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:27,340
That person

965
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:30,840
really disappeared in your life?

966
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,840
I believe you know the answer.

967
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,840
It's me,

968
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,340
I am translucent,

969
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:06,340
so the reason we met

970
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:09,080
was not

971
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:19,980
because Hua Yi knew I was not good enough in

972
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:22,340
other were.....

973
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:23,840
You know,

974
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,540
Hua Yi must be

975
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:29,540
a person who has felt guilty.

976
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:32,540
You've got the first type of diabetes.

977
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:35,540
It may be a big deal when you're pregnant.

978
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:42,540
Is this disease good for your health?

979
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,540
Can you take any treatment?

980
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:48,540
Well, we can only do this once.

981
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:51,540
But after the transplant, we need to take the medicine.

982
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,540
Because the transplant is a lost function,

983
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:57,540
the child needs to rely on the transplant to maintain his blood circulation.

984
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:58,540
But it's okay.

985
00:50:58,540 --> 00:50:59,540
As long as we take good care of him,

986
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:02,540
he won't have any serious problems.

987
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:07,540
Oh, right.

988
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:10,540
Do you know the father of the child?

989
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:29,540
Father!

990
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:31,540
What's the matter?

991
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:33,540
Did you get a fever?

992
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:35,540
Yes.

993
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:38,540
You're a little bit tired.

994
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:40,540
You should tell me.

995
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:41,540
No.

996
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:43,540
I'm not sick.

997
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:44,540
I'm pregnant today.

998
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:46,540
You're my son's wife.

999
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:47,540
I'm pregnant.

1000
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:48,540
I'm pregnant.

1001
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:49,540
I'm pregnant.

1002
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:50,540
I'm pregnant.

1003
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:51,540
I'm pregnant.

1004
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:52,540
You're right.

1005
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:53,540
I'm pregnant too.

1006
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:54,540
I'm pregnant.

1007
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,540
I'm pregnant.

1008
00:51:56,540 --> 00:52:00,540
Have I been sick of the organ such as the heart failure poo?

1009
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:02,540
But you can see,

1010
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:04,540
I'm living with the隱 gluten.

1011
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:07,540
I'm really in a position to prevent you from taking a sweet Mallins.

1012
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:09,540
But your maids are pretty.

1013
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:11,540
You look so pretty.

1014
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:13,540
No.

1015
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:17,540
What kind of maids do you think of in bath Zhaum just call for the baby girl.

1016
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:18,540
C'mon.

1017
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,540
How lang of you are you scared of until now?

1018
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,540
Pious, I'm not going to tell you this.

1019
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:23,540
What?

1020
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,540
You just run yourются ,

1021
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:26,820
What are you doing?

1022
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:27,860
I'm telling you to go.

1023
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:29,060
Go away!

1024
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:30,300
Go away!

1025
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:32,900
What are you doing?

1026
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,220
I'm going to go.

1027
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:35,340
What?

1028
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:36,860
Your dad is going to go?

1029
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:39,500
You're going to go to the toilet with your kids.

1030
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,900
You're not going to play with me.

1031
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,540
You're not my son.

1032
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:46,020
I want to see your dad.

1033
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:49,620
I'm going to eat and drink.

1034
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:51,380
You go and your dad will be angry.

1035
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:52,260
He's my son.

1036
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:53,900
Alright.

1037
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:55,740
That's bad.

1038
00:52:56,220 --> 00:53:00,260
Don't make me come to you even after we've planted seeds.

1039
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,140
What you do isn't right.

1040
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:03,300
I told them to raise me but why doesn't anyone?

1041
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:06,220
Do you think the school is very important to you?

1042
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:08,980
Are you also going to go from experience to enrolled in?

1043
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:10,580
No.

1044
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,180
You are guild leader,

1045
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,920
I come up with the schoolhand.

1046
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:16,420
Accept it.

1047
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,820
Accept it.

1048
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:18,740
Just once more.

1049
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:21,020
All of my students and relatives are watchful,

1050
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:24,020
You're not going to be a big deal if you're not going to be a big deal.

1051
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:25,020
It's a deal.

1052
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:27,020
Or else you'll be in trouble.

1053
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:29,020
You're a big deal.

1054
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:31,020
Big deal.

1055
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:35,020
Dad, I'm sorry.

1056
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:37,020
That's right.

1057
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:39,020
I know.

1058
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:41,020
You're a big deal.

1059
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:43,020
You're not going to be a big deal if you're not going to be a big deal.

1060
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:46,020
But people's business is also good.

1061
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:49,020
You're going to be a big deal.

1062
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:52,020
The big deal is coming soon.

1063
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:55,020
I can't wait for the big deal.

1064
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:57,020
Fine.

1065
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:59,020
I'll take care of the business.

1066
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:02,020
I'll ask him to come out and tell you clearly.

1067
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:04,020
You're out of your mind?

1068
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:07,020
You think I'm going to be a big deal if I come out?

1069
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:08,020
What?

1070
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:09,020
You're coming?

1071
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:11,020
I'm not going to be a big deal.

1072
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:13,020
I'll stay calm.

1073
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:17,020
You're going to be a big deal if you're not going to be a big deal.

1074
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,120
How can you lose your confidence on seeing me?

1075
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:19,780
you won't let me drop you?

1076
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:22,980
snap

1077
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:28,260
Tell me how bad are the画 Jiyeong

1078
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,640

1079
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:32,180
Let me mn聜

00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:36,380
arriving late and then木 cristian

1081
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,720
Mister,

1082
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,380
think of a law

1083
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:40,880
for 110 같 field

1084
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:42,440
I'd see our gottenieur

1085
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:44,400
Be a queen

1086
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:45,600
oretically you are two days old

1087
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,680
big bad

1088
00:54:47,020 --> 00:55:05,140
good?

1089
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:19,020
Ah!

1090
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:34,020
Didn't you say that the place of Hua Tiansun has been taken?

1091
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:36,020
Why haven't they moved yet?

1092
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:38,020
What are you going to do?

1093
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:40,020
I and Hua Tiansun have been studying for a long time.

1094
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,020
They don't want to sell land.

1095
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:46,020
Later I found out that Hua Tiansun's land was registered in the village head's village.

1096
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,020
The name of Hua Shenzhen.

1097
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:50,020
Hua Shenzhen is very rich.

1098
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:54,020
I even asked the local village head to lend him a very good loan.

1099
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:57,020
Then he asked him to borrow money from the local government.

1100
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:00,020
Look at you. You're going to pay for it.

1101
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:02,020
You're so lucky.

1102
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:04,020
You're so lucky.

1103
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:05,020
Why are you so stubborn?

1104
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:07,020
Now the money is coming.

1105
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:09,020
He doesn't have money to pay.

1106
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:11,020
Hua Tiansun's land is ours.

1107
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:13,020
You can't get a single land.

1108
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:15,020
You can't get the land under the jade.

1109
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:20,020
These villagers are all living in the middle of the world.

1110
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:22,020
They have no place to go.

1111
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,020
So...

1112
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,020
So what?

1113
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:26,020
I don't care about that much.

1114
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:28,020
I just know that they have taken this land

1115
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:32,020
and have the secret of the Zhu Yi Hui Mian Huan Yi Group.

1116
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:38,020
Hua Tiansun's land is ours.

1117
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:41,020
Hua Tiansun is still in the camp.

1118
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:44,020
If you don't take care of this,

1119
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:45,020
I'll tell you.

1120
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:48,020
The Group that I founded

1121
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:50,020
will destroy your hands.

1122
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:52,020
I know.

1123
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:54,020
I won't let anyone find out

1124
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:57,020
why we bought Hua Tiansun's land.

1125
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:59,020
If it's not good,

1126
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:03,020
you'll know the real estate will be destroyed tomorrow.

1127
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:10,020
Hurry up.

1128
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:12,020
You have to take Guangxi to the hospital.

1129
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:14,020
Why are you going to the office again?

1130
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:16,020
I've seen the news.

1131
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:18,020
Congratulations.

1132
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:20,020
The third year of the construction of the company

1133
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,020
will be delayed for many years.

1134
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,020
Once you get out of the company,

1135
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:24,020
you'll get the market for the income.

1136
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:26,020
For your lawyer,

1137
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:28,020
you'll get a beautiful job.

1138
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:32,020
Dad,

1139
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:35,020
you should have used Guangxi to take care of me.

1140
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:38,020
Why did you ask everyone to come out for dinner?

1141
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:41,020
You should have come to the office with Xiaoling.

1142
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:42,020
Right, Auntie?

1143
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:44,020
It's not a big deal.

1144
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:47,020
It's a good thing I've got a job with Xiaoling.

1145
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:52,020
We're very happy to accept your invitation.

1146
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:57,020
Guangxi,

1147
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:01,020
I heard that the mayor has received cash for the habit.

1148
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:02,020
And he has a lot of tricks.

1149
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,020
Master,

1150
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:04,020
have you drunk too much?

1151
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:06,020
How could you forget our lawyer's basic principles?

1152
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:09,020
You should have helped the mayor to keep the secret.

1153
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:12,020
But because of our relationship,

1154
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:13,020
I can be more specific.

1155
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:16,020
No matter how my client is,

1156
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:17,020
as long as I have money,

1157
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:19,020
I can help him to agree to the matter.

1158
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:37,020
He doesn't blame himself because He wanted a lot more.

1159
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:42,020
So I want to sell very closely to contact theantiate customer.

1160
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,020
Please come to me.

1161
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:48,020
We're sorry.

1162
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:52,020
But800 yuan isn't a small sum for all the public senior projects.

1163
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:57,020
No,

1164
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:59,020
we don't have to for club business.

1165
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:01,020
The package producers should have bought us into selling it.

1166
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:03,020
I can help her with anything.

1167
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:05,020
No matter how my client is,

1168
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:07,020
as long as I have money,

1169
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:09,020
I can help her to make a living.

1170
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:22,020
Guangxi,

1171
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:25,020
don't forget to thank He Dong for your success.

1172
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:28,020
Of course.

1173
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:30,020
If I wasn't the one who saved Ming'er,

1174
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:32,020
I would have been the one who saved Ming'er.

1175
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:34,020
Ming'er, you're a good student.

1176
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:40,020
Here you are.

1177
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:50,020
I have this honor to dance with you.

1178
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:03,020
Do you remember when we first met?

1179
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:05,020
On the playground?

1180
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:06,020
No.

1181
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:08,020
I don't remember anything.

1182
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:12,020
I said I would see you when I woke up.

1183
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:21,020
Do you remember what it means?

1184
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:32,020
I remember.

1185
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:48,020
Guangxi, you're awake.

1186
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:51,020
How do you feel?

1187
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:59,020
Guangxi, what's wrong?

1188
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:02,020
Can you speak?

1189
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:06,020
Thank you.

1190
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,020
It's almost as if he's a newborn child.

1191
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:34,020
And he'll have to learn everything all over again.

1192
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:35,020
Emily,

1193
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:38,020
this is going to be a very difficult recovery.

1194
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:43,020
It's okay.

1195
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:49,020
Don't be afraid.

1196
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:52,020
It's okay to talk to you.

1197
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:58,020
As long as you hold my hand like this,

1198
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:01,020
I know you need me.

1199
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:09,020
I'm Yiqian.

1200
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:16,020
Yiqian.

1201
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:17,020
Yiqian.

1202
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:27,020
So,

1203
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:31,020
the bunny goes around the tree

1204
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:34,020
and into the burrow

1205
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:36,020
and chives.

1206
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:40,020
Try it.

1207
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:47,020
It's okay.

1208
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:54,020
The rabbit is here.

1209
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,020
Let the rabbit go.

1210
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:18,020
I'm going to go to the burrow.

1211
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:20,020

I'm going to go to the burrow.

1262
01:05:56,020 --> 01:06:00,020
Just like the world as I pass through winter,

1263
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:02,020
and my heart is exhausted,

1264
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:05,020
but as he found out,

1265
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:07,020
all the mosquitos are dead.

1266
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:08,860
Cashier, I'll give you a drink

1267
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:10,540
Ok

Thank you

1269
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:20,900
Are you going to pay the bill?

1270
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:22,740
Why did you take so long?

1271
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:24,660
No

1272
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:25,740
Is heήσing?

1273
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:28,700
But you tegen me

1274
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:30,660
I don't have time

1275
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:34,060
Why did you don't pay the bill?

1276
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:36,460
I thought they were slowly going

1277
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:38,460
I owe you

1278
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:40,460
Thank you

1279
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:44,460
Look, what did you say?

1280
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:52,460
I owe you

1281
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:10,460
So, I'm holding onto my hand

1282
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:12,460
What am I afraid of?

1283
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:16,460
I'm afraid of being in a fight

1284
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:22,460
I'm afraid of losing you

1285
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:27,460
I'm afraid that you have doubts about my love

1286
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:31,460
I'm afraid

1287
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:35,460
You don't know how important you are to me

1288
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:39,460
You're the proof of love

1289
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:45,460
The day, the day, the day, the rain, the rain, the afternoon

1290
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:00,460
I'm afraid of losing you

1291
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:04,460
I'm afraid you have doubts about my love.

1292
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:08,460
I'm afraid you don't know how important you are to me.

1293
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:35,460
When I wake up,

1294
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:38,460
you say,

1295
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:40,460
as long as I need you,

1296
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:43,460
you will have me.

1297
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:50,460
I want to tell you,

1298
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:55,460
I need you all my life.

1299
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:04,460
I want to tell you,

1300
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:09,460
all my life.

1301
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:34,460
I want to tell you,

1302
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:37,460
all my life.

1303
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:40,460
Do you understand English?

1304
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:45,460
My English is what you call me.

1305
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:50,460
Everybody goes around the tree.

1306
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:54,460
This is called a whole time.

1307
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:04,460
Would you marry me?

1308
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:34,460
English is what you call me.

1309
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:37,460
I want to tell you,

1310
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:40,460
all my life.

1311
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:43,460
Do you understand English?

1312
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:46,460
My English is what you call me.

1313
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:49,460
I want to tell you,

1314
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:52,460
all my life.

1315
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:55,460
I want to tell you,

1316
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:58,460
all my life.

1317
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:00,460
Mu Ze, please email us.

1318
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:02,460
We need to find a lawyer.

1319
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:03,460
It's okay.

1320
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:04,460
You can go.

1321
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:06,460
The case of Chen Baimeng and Hua Tengcheng,

1322
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:09,460
I think it's the case of Hua Tengcheng and me.

1323
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:11,460
Da Li Shi,

1324
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:13,460
you are not going to be a lawyer.

1325
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:15,460
Which one?

1326
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:18,460
She is from Da's school.

1327
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:22,460
You are not going to be a father?

1328
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:25,460
Dad.

1329
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:27,460
You can't be a good daughter.

1330
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:30,460
You can't be a good daughter.

1331
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:34,460
I am the only one who can be a lawyer.

1332
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:37,460
I am the one who can be a lawyer.

1333
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:39,460
Xi.

1334
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:41,460
Xiao Le,

1335
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:42,460
I have told you,

1336
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:44,460
you are the lawyer uncle of Taipei.

1337
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:46,460
It's not you.

1338
01:11:57,460 --> 01:12:00,460
Suddenly I am in love.

1339
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:03,460
I am not a child,

1340
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:06,460
but a confession.

1341
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:09,460
I am like a love.

1342
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:12,460
Suddenly I am in love.

1343
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:15,460
The most cruel confession.

1344
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:18,460
I want to eat the falling dumplings.

1345
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:21,460
I feel comfortable.

1346
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:25,460
I am a living being.

1347
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:28,460
Suddenly I understand,

1348
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:33,460
everything is not love.

1349
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:35,460
Hua Tengcheng,

1350
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:37,460
I am a love.

1351
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:40,460
I am not a child,

1352
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:46,460
but a confession.

1353
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:51,460
I always fall in love.

1354
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:55,460
I still let people open their eyes.

1355
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:59,460
I used to be so excited.

1356
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:03,460
I always fall in love.

1357
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:07,460
I want to stay in love.

1358
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:12,460
I should be like this.
