1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Next, I will give you the next happy moment

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Michelle! Michelle!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Dad! Dad!

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Are you ready?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You can be my aunt, I will be your dad

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Why? I can't be your dad?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
No, you are my grandchild

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And your mom told you to marry the bride

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You can't be my grandchild

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Did that person really disappear from your life?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's okay, you will take care of the past dreams

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Mom, tell me the story of the grandfather

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
When will you tell the truth to Xiao Le?

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
She will know one day that her dad is not an outsider

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I only need to remember these

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I only want to go with you

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's enough

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You don't deserve to be a lawyer, you don't deserve to be a person!

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
No matter how my client is, as long as I have money

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I can help her to do whatever she wants

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid that your love for me is suspicious

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm afraid that you don't know how important you are to me

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sorry

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Wafu!

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Mom, aunt, Xiao Ling, you are so good

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Mom, you can't go home tonight to sleep

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm so happy to hear that you are awake

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I've been waiting for this for so long

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm so sorry

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What are you doing?

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You really want to have such a good relationship?

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
She had a love for me, but she was taken away by me

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Now she is going to marry someone else

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Are you afraid that she will remember everything?

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
She had been married long ago

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
She has been married for six years

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So she can have a good relationship

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You should change someone's personality

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
She was not a man who tried his best

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Now she can pursue her success with a kind heart

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't think that's good for Guangxi

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I think it's perfect

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Besides, it's good for us to be in a good relationship

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Look at the bright future of Guangxi

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The perfect companion and the social status of people

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Isn't this a miracle for a mother and son?

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I want her to forget the past and forget all the bad things

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Am I wrong?

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Me and My Princess

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Hong Kong is an academic hub

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Thumbs up!

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Well said!

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
We trust that you improved completely

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,800
But ma'am, you are a dwarf

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That's why today we'd like to help everyone

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I think people are not l awake

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Even though you are so fanatic

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,800
okay everyone, strong wind is blowing

59
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,220
But I can't

60
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,600
In this generation

61
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,540
In every town

62
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,040
There might not be anyone who is brave enough

63
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,920
to draw the characters in all voices

64
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,080
To see if they are all right

65
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,120
No way

66
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,900
No way

67
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,080
Don't mess with the scale

68
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,300
It's your fault

69
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,740
He has a whole family

70
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,980
It won't be我们's fault

71
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,180
Why makes him a big appetite

72
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:21,980
Every factory also has tiene

73
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,860
That is right

74
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,700
Give me

75
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,280
Hurry, here

76
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,380
Coming

77
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,300
ingredient

78
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,280
Lots of joy

79
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,680
What are you doing?

80
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,680
I'm going to the park.

81
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,080
Do you have a radio?

82
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,080
My milk won't harm you.

83
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,880
You're here.

84
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,080
You still want to go to the park?

85
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,880
You go first.

86
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,080
I'll be quick.

87
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,480
Okay, let's go.

88
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,680
Okay.

89
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,280
Let's go and fight.

90
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,080
Let's go and fight.

91
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,680
Let's go and fight.

92
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,280
The minute morning

93
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,280
Please return yourethrough of dayées.

94
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,560
You came instead of waiting?

95
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,240
You was easy to rush to Jîs' side,

96
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,280
can't I use my tip to you?

97
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,400
But it didn't yield anything,

98
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,700
even a few cheapskate designs can't achieve it

99
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,500
and movingments are much more vulnerable.

100
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,920
Also today,

101
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,920
Hurry up!

102
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,920
Hurry up!

103
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,920
Hurry up!

104
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,920
Hurry up!

105
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,920
Hurry up!

106
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,920
Hurry up!

107
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,920
Hurry up!

108
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,920
I'm Xu Fang Guo, the vice president of the company.

109
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,920
Which one is the real one?

110
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,920
Where's the real one?

111
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,920
I'm here to inform you.

112
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,920
The real one is in one week.

113
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,920
Hurry up!

114
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,920
Hurry up!

115
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,920
Hurry up!

116
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,920
Hurry up!

117
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,920
I'm here to inform you.

118
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,920
Hurry up!

119
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,920
Look carefully.

120
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,920
The real one is Huashen Bin and Huan Yu Qi.

121
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,920
He's the real one who took Huashen's land.

122
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,920
Now that he's here, he doesn't have money to pay.

123
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,920
The real one is already Huan Yu Qi.

124
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,920
The evidence is here.

125
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,920
I'm sorry.

126
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,420
I'm sorry.

127
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,420
It's almost time for us to be here.

128
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,420
It's not so good when you have the money and go straight to the market.

129
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,420
They just took it for free.

130
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,920
If we can't get the answer right in one week,

131
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,920
except for one week, we'll send them dokner property.

132
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,920
You're so complicated!

133
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,920
There's nothing you can do.

134
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,920
Xu Fen!

135
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
If youaign or nothing,

136
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,920
everyone will tell you that you're making videos and you'll get scolded.

137
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
You verschad eyes or she'll call you,

138
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,420
you're just joking yeah.

139
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,420
What are you doing?

140
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,420
What are you doing?

141
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,420
Are you old?

142
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,420
I just took a break.

143
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,420
Did you bring me to the kitchen?

144
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,420
No, that's not good.

145
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,420
What are you doing?

146
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,420
I've known you for a long time.

147
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,420
Why are you here?

148
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,420
Are you the one who planted the flowers?

149
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,420
I think you're quite suitable for this.

150
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,420
Everyone's brain is filled with vegetables and wild wild animals.

151
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,420
Give me a chance.

152
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,420
You look weird.

153
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,420
Do you remember that little brother of mine?

154
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,420
Pingzai, Yuanxi's brother.

155
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,420
What's that next to me?

156
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,420
Have you ever thought that he's been looking for you for a long time?

157
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,420
I can't find him.

158
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,420
Does it have anything to do with you?

159
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,420
I think this is called the best for the poor.

160
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,420
But he called me yesterday.

161
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,420
No way.

162
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,420
How could he not know?

163
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:16,420
Or should he say that he only knows that he can call me?

164
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,420
Of course it's impossible.

165
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,420
He sold the whole flower field.

166
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,420
Why did he keep calling you?

167
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,420
Anyway, I'll come back after a week.

168
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,420
I'll be more careful when I get back.

169
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,420
I won't be so polite to everyone.

170
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,420
What are you looking at?

171
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,420
Hurry up and move out.

172
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,420
Hello?

173
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,420
I'm warning you.

174
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,420
Before those villagers left the flower field,

175
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,420
they had to show their true colors.

176
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,420
Don't make any mistakes.

177
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,420
Did you hear that?

178
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,420
Yang Xiaole, who told you to go with them to visit the village?

179
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,420
You know how dangerous it is?

180
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,420
There's no way.

181
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,420
Why are you so slow?

182
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,420
Sorry. Where are they?

183
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,420
They've all gone back.

184
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,420
You're the chief secretary.

185
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,420
Help us to find a lawyer.

186
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,420
The case is not a total crime.

187
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,420
It's a crime to be accused.

188
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,420
So you're the one who's sentenced to death.

189
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,420
You're accused of being innocent.

190
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,420
Thank you for your kindness.

191
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,420
It's delicious.

192
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,420
Don't bother.

193
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,420
Are you going to forget?

194
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,420
We both know it very well.

195
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,420
Don't worry about the case.

196
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,420
Remember to go home.

197
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,420
My mom left this morning.

198
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,420
Are you dead?

199
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,420
Your mom and I were in the same boat.

200
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,420
Where did you get the white bag?

201
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,420
I didn't forget.

202
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:35,420
Ever since the first time you did that,

203
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,420
I've been in pain and want to die.

204
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,420
I lost my mom and aunt since I was a child.

205
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,420
It was all my fault.

206
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,420
But you've been waiting for me.

207
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,420
I won't let you go.

208
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,420
Go.

209
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,420
You think I'm afraid of you?

210
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,420
You're going to keep looking for me?

211
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,420
I told you I was angry.

212
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,420
I'm not guilty.

213
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:05,420
I didn't expect you to be a mother and a daughter.

214
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,420
I'm the one who gave you the place.

215
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,420
I'm the one who gave you the place.

216
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,420
Why did you work so hard?

217
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,420
You owe me.

218
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,420
You should have told me.

219
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,420
I owe you.

220
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,420
I've worked so hard to raise him.

221
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,420
I'll eat you up if you don't want to.

222
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,420
Don't eat him.

223
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,420
You're a man.

224
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,420
Doctor.

225
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,420
Doctor, why are you hitting people?

226
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,420
Doctor.

227
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,420
The blood on the patient's head has been suppressed

228
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,420
to the heart.

229
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,420
The patient's personality change

230
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,420
is possible.

231
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,420
By the way,

232
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,420
he told me that

233
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,420
before he hit people,

234
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,420
there would be strange pictures in his head

235
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,420
that he felt very painful.

236
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,420
Does that mean he has some memories

237
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,420
that he will slowly remember?

238
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,420
He's a very strange person.

239
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,420
He's a very strange person.

240
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,420
And he's a very strange person.

241
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,420
I think he's very strange.

242
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,420
He has some memories that he will slowly remember.

243
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,420
Doctor, I'm sorry.

244
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,420
I can only tell you the whole result.

245
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,420
He's in a very bad state.

246
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,420
But what are those pictures?

247
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,420
What's the meaning of Dr. Wang?

248
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,420
Only Dr. Wang

249
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,420
can find the answer.

250
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,420
What are you thinking about?

251
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,420
What do you mean?

252
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,420
Nothing.

253
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,420
Your head is not in one shape.

254
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,420
But the pictures in your head

255
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,420
are not in one shape.

256
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,420
I can't find them.

257
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,420
You can't find them now.

258
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,420
I'm sorry.

259
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,420
I didn't mean to hit people.

260
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,420
I don't know why I was so impulsive.

261
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,420
I feel like

262
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,420
something similar happened in the past.

263
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,420
Wang Xi,

264
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,420
the police found out that you're really fine.

265
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,420
Let's change our perspective.

266
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,420
Maybe you'll think about more and more things.

267
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,420
This is the main progress.

268
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,420
You should be happy.

269
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,420
But you're still hitting people in court today.

270
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,420
I think the court will punish you.

271
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,420
Hello?

272
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,420
Dr. Ren,

273
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,420
the punishment you did to Mr. Li Wangcai

274
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,420
in your morning

275
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,420
is to hurt the police.

276
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,420
Mr. Li,

277
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,420
we're warning you.

278
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,420
We're paying you back.

279
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,420
And we've been sentenced to death.

280
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,420
Because I hit that bastard,

281
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,420
you're going to punish me for 240 hours.

282
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,420
You think it's because you're a lawyer

283
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,420
and you're a lawyer?

284
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,420
It's because you're going to be punished.

285
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,420
It means you're a little conscience.

286
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,420
So you're going to be punished

287
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,420
for 240 hours.

288
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,420
Forget it.

289
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,420
Where's the address?

290
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,420
What?

291
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,420
You're going to Hua Tianchun?

292
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,420
I hit my client in court today.

293
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,420
The punishment is not enough for me.

294
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,420
Hua Tianchun just had an old case.

295
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:01,420
I'm going to the court to pay 240 hours.

296
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,420
Besides being a lawyer,

297
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,420
I might even help them.

298
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,420
Why are you so impulsive?

299
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,420
It's not an accident.

300
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,420
I heard this is a case of sexual assault.

301
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,420
A young girl with a high and weak back

302
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,420
is a big and weak girl.

303
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,420
You're the most shameless person in this situation.

304
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,420
This proves

305
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,420
you don't have any sense of justice.

306
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,420
Enough.

307
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,420
Stop talking about justice.

308
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,420
We're all preparing for your wedding.

309
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,420
How could you leave like this?

310
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,420
It's okay.

311
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,420
You can go.

312
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,420
It's a coincidence.

313
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,420
I bought Hua Tianchun's land recently.

314
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,420
You said that the case of Hua Tianchun

315
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,420
was the case of Hua Tianchun.

316
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,420
But Hua Tianchun's reputation

317
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,420
is so stupid.

318
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,420
He sold his land.

319
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,420
He didn't move his money.

320
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,420
I'll take a little more money.

321
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,420
Don't worry about this.

322
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,420
Don't help them.

323
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,420
I'll let you be a good person.

324
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,420
I'll make up for their $500,000.

325
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,420
I'll take them to the court.

326
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,420
Don't worry, Uncle.

327
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,420
I don't want to waste time there.

328
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,420
I've checked.

329
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,420
I can't even find the GPS.

330
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,420
I'll go to the village to get the evidence.

331
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,420
I'll be back soon.

332
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,420
Yes.

333
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,420
Go and finish it.

334
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,420
Come back to marry Yixing.

335
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,420
Your wedding will be better as soon as possible.

336
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,420
I've been waiting for a long time.

337
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,420
You're going to die.

338
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,420
You're going to die!

339
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,420
You're going to die!

340
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,420
You're going to die!

341
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,420
Yixing!

342
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,420
Yixing!

343
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,420
Yixing!

344
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,420
Yixing!

345
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,420
Yixing!

346
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,420
I think the flower field is pretty.

347
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,020
Although you're going to the doctor's,

348
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,020
it's not bad to be a nurse.

349
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,320
Can't you go with me?

350
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,320
You haven't been a nurse for a long time.

351
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,820
No.

352
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,520
I've already taken several shots.

353
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,820
And it's not a small operation.

354
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,820
Can't you just leave?

355
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,020
I'm not by your side.

356
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,120
The medicine you should take and the vitamin you should take are still the same.

357
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,320
Is it really useful to take those medicines?

358
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,120
No wonder those words suddenly appeared in my head.

359
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,020
Let's not judge such a stupid thing.

360
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,420
But,

361
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:19,820
maybe those things are very important memories for you.

362
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,220
If those words are my old memories,

363
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,520
and I can't control myself and hit people,

364
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,020
then I must be wrong in the past.

365
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,220
I don't want to know him at all.

366
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,620
You were the same as before.

367
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,620
Come here.

368
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,920
You've been doing everything for your aunt's sake for the past years.

369
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,820
You've done everything to make it a success and not a failure.

370
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,920
You were the same as before.

371
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,720
Although I was a loser,

372
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,920
you were very loyal.

373
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,020
I didn't take it seriously.

374
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:03,020
But this time, I found a thing.

375
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,620
What is it?

376
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,220
I thought you've changed over the years.

377
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,220
But,

378
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,220
you're still the same.

379
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:19,020
You're still the same as I was.

380
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,620
You're my favorite person.

381
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,020
So,

382
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:27,220
the next task is to finish the 240 hours of the show

383
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,820
and then go back to the side.

384
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,220
I'll be back as soon as possible.

385
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,420
And then, you're going to be the most beautiful bride.

386
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,620
Good night.

387
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,820
God bless you.

388
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:24,720
An Yu, don't ask me where were those crowds from!

389
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,880
I'm waiting for a party there.

390
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,760
Seeing that you need to have a legs.

391
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,640
That's a waste of time.

392
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,840
I certainly wish we prepared whatever we can.

393
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,200
There's plenty to sell out there at a time like this!

394
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,660
I don't want to wild off sweater!

395
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,640
You must open the store now.

396
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,660
I ever raise your sound for you,

397
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,660
Ok, ok, ok.

398
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,660
Boss, I'll tell you.

399
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,660
Ok, like this.

400
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,660
Wait until I take the time to clean it.

401
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,660
Ok, ok, ok.

402
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,660
Don't be afraid.

403
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,660
Ok, ok, ok.

404
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,660
Boss,

405
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,660
I'm afraid it's too expensive to buy a car.

406
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,660
It's too expensive.

407
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,660
Little Le,

408
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,660
isn't your mom picking you up?

409
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,660
A car is worth 30,000 yuan.

410
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,660
A car is worth 30,000 yuan.

411
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,660
A car is worth 30,000 yuan.

412
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,660
You can't afford it.

413
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,660
Ha ha,

414
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,660
you know the way.

415
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,660
You know the way.

416
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,660
Let's play.

417
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,660
We'll be careful.

418
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,660
Please.

419
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,660
It's too expensive.

420
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,660
I'll go get it.

421
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,660
Little Le.

422
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,660
Yes?

423
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,660
Give me a bag.

424
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,660
Ha ha,

425
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,660
what are you doing?

426
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,660
What are you doing?

427
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,660
What are you doing?

428
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,660
What are you doing?

429
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,660
I'm cleaning.

430
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,660
What are you doing?

431
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,660
Give it to me.

432
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,660
Little Le,

433
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,660
please help me clean it.

434
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,660
It's too much.

435
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,660
Give it to me.

436
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,660
Come on.

437
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,660
Come on.

438
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,660
Do you want to try it?

439
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,660
Try it.

440
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,660
Ok, ok, ok.

441
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,660
Don't sell it.

442
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,660
Give me a hand.

443
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,660
It's broken.

444
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,660
I used it.

445
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,660
It's good just now.

446
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,660
It's not broken.

447
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,660
Ok, ok, ok.

448
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,660
Little Le,

449
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,660
it's ok.

450
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,660
Come on.

451
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,660
This is for you.

452
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,660
How much is this?

453
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,660
30,000 yuan.

454
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,660
What's wrong with you, Little Le?

455
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,660
Don't eat it.

456
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,660
You're so big.

457
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,660
You should have 30,000 yuan.

458
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,660
30,000 yuan?

459
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,660
Yes.

460
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,660
It's too expensive.

461
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,660
It's so expensive.

462
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,660
It's too expensive.

463
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,660
Here,

464
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,660
apologize to Hua Hong.

465
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,660
I'll find a way to pay her back.

466
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,660
I'm sorry.

467
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,660
I'm sorry.

468
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,660
Little Le didn't mean it.

469
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,660
Little Le,

470
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,660
come here.

471
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,660
I'll tell you.

472
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,660
I'll take you to the restaurant.

473
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,660
You can go to the restaurant.

474
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,660
My boss will give you a ride.

475
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,660
You should also tell him

476
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,660
that he's going to be a good wife.

477
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,660
He's not a good wife.

478
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,660
You should also tell him

479
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,660
that he's going to be a good wife.

480
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,660
He's a good wife.

481
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,660
Now,

482
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,660
if you don't have money,

483
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,660
you can go to the restaurant.

484
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,660
I'm telling you,

485
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:28,660
you can't afford to go to the restaurant.

486
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,660
Ok,

487
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,660
I'll tell you.

488
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,660
I'll pay you back.

489
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,660
Ok, I'll pay you back.

490
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,660
Tomorrow?

491
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,660
I'll pay you back.

492
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,660
No, I can't.

493
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,660
I just came to see the village head.

494
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,660
He's coming to help us

495
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,660
to clean up the house

496
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,660
and take care of the lawyer.

497
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,660
He's going to stay with us.

498
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,660
I'm going to the whole room

499
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,660
and take care of him.

500
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,660
He's a good wife.

501
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,660
He can take care of the other people.

502
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,660
He's a good wife.

503
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,660
I don't want to

504
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,660
make him a party.

505
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,660
I don't know.

506
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,660
He's going to be a good wife.

507
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,660
He's not going to take care of the other people.

508
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,660
He's not going to take care of you.

509
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,660
Otherwise,

510
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,660
you can go to the restaurant.

511
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,660
Little Le,

512
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,660
tomorrow,

513
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,660
you can help me

514
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,660
to go to the new lawyer

515
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,660
with Mr. Hua.

516
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,660
Ok,

517
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,660
I'll go to the restaurant.

518
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,660
I'll tell you later.

519
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,660
I'll go to the market and the store.

520
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,660
Ok, Mr. Hua,

521
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,660
I'll go to the new lawyer.

522
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,660
I'll go to the new lawyer.

523
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,660
I'll go to the new lawyer.

524
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,660
Not bad.

525
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,660
Mr. Hua, not bad.

526
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,660
Why are you so late?

527
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,660
Why do you have to go?

528
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,660
Why do you have to go?

529
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,660
I'm telling you.

530
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,660
You can't go.

531
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,660
You're not going out.

532
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,660
No.

533
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,660
You go to the market.

534
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,660
Why don't you go?

535
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,660
Why do I have to go?

536
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,660
I'm telling you.

537
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,660
If you don't want to go,

538
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,660
ask the police

539
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,660
to take care of the other owner.

540
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,660
I'll tell you later.

541
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,660
You can't go.

542
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,660
You're not going out.

543
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,660
No.

544
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,660
You're going to the market.

545
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,660
Why are you going?

546
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,660
Why?

547
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,660
I'm telling you.

548
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,660
If you want to go to the market,

549
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,660
I will not let you go.

550
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,660
Your wife will come to my boss.

551
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,340
My boss has contract

552
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,280
I told you that you had a boyfriend

553
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,640
I took care of you

554
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,900
Muho went abroad with a partner

555
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,020
I tell you

556
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:47,420
I was the

557
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:47,920
겁a

558
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,640
it looks like a gentleman

559
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,160
Long night

560
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,960
You bear the fool

561
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,780
what

562
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,680
This is how he said

563
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,780
Mu Chen's wife

564
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,000
you've the heart

565
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,340
The boss is a gentleman

566
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,340
No

567
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,340
No, no, no, no

568
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,340
It's not that long

569
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,340
You know what?

570
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,340
You know what?

571
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,340
We have a party at the hotel

572
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,340
You know what?

573
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,340
You have to come to Taipei

574
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,340
You have to go to the party

575
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,340
You have to come to the party

576
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,340
You just come to me

577
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,340
I'll take you there

578
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,340
I'll take you to the party

579
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,340
I'll take you there

580
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,340
Don't go

581
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,340
No, don't go

582
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,340
Don't go

583
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,340
Don't go

584
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,340
Taipei

585
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,340
Hey, Taoking, what are you doing now?

586
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,340
What's the matter?

587
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:17,340
It seems like a car crash

588
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,340
What's wrong?

589
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:22,340
Right, a car crash

590
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,340
Sorry, Taoking, I'm sorry

591
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,340
I have to go to the party

592
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,340
I'll be back in a minute

593
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,340
I'll be back in a minute

594
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,340
I don't have time

595
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,340
Let's see if we can get a car

596
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,340
I'll be back in a minute

597
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,340
I'll be back in a minute

598
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,340
I'll be back in a minute

599
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,340
That's Mr. Chen

600
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,340
Mr. Chen, how are you?

601
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,340
What's wrong with you?

602
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:43,340
I don't know. I only saw the train station

603
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,340
I'm fine. I'll go to Taipei with you

604
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,340
You can stay here for a while

605
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,340
I'll be back in a minute

606
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,340
Okay, bye

607
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,340
Xiaole

608
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:03,340
I'll tell you something. The train is not that long

609
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,340
Let's go to the train

610
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:10,340
Uncle, Mr. Chen and Dad are going to Taipei

611
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,340
Did he come from Da Laqiu?

612
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,340
No, we're going to tell you

613
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,340
There are many people in Da Laqiu

614
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:19,340
They're all going to the train station

615
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,340
This is the station, do you know?

616
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:26,340
I know. But I have to tell you something

617
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:30,340
Xiaole, you're so stubborn

618
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,340
I'm telling you, I'm so stubborn

619
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:36,340
I'm telling you, I'm not a good person

620
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,340
I'm not a good person

621
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,340
I'm just a good person

622
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:04,340
This is my life-saving machine

623
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,340
Although the land of Huatian City is sold to the soldiers

624
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:12,340
But don't worry. As long as you follow me

625
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,340
I'll guarantee you won't be in the boat for the rest of your life

626
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,340
And we can also bring Xiaole and Huahong

627
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:21,340
to the city to start a new life

628
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,340
I'll be there for you

629
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,340
I'll be there for you

630
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:30,340
I'll also bring Xiaole and Huahong to start a new life

631
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,340
What do you think?

632
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,340
It's just my wife. She has no chance to be a shaman

633
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,340
I'm not easy to get a good answer

634
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,340
She can't go to a shaman. She can't walk

635
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,340
and she'll leave me and Huahong two friends

636
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:49,340
Huahong is still young. She's always looking after her mother

637
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,340
And you just called a new husband

638
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,340
What do you think?

639
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,340
I just want you to understand

640
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,340
Tomorrow we'll...

641
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:02,340
Boss Huah, I'm living well now

642
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,340
I don't feel tired at all

643
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:08,340
I'm happy. Thank you for caring about Xiaole and me

644
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:13,340
So we're good friends

645
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,340
You're shy, right?

646
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,340
I like you

647
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:26,340
Although you're a child, you're still as pure and innocent as a young girl

648
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,340
If you don't want to get married so soon, it's fine

649
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,340
We can get married first. We can get along

650
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:39,340
If you want to, we can learn to get married

651
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:42,340
Just like buying things. Try it and then you'll get married

652
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:45,340
Boss Huah, you're actually very good at making conditions

653
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:49,340
You can find a woman who's better and more suitable for you

654
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,340
I'm very excited to drink with Xiaole

655
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,340
I don't understand what you're talking about

656
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:04,340
You're weird. Huah-yi said you're interested in me

657
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,340
What are you insisting on?

658
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,340
I'm not good at math

659
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:15,340
What do you want? Tell me

660
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:19,340
No, Huah-yi told me that you asked me out

661
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,340
She wanted to talk about the compensation

662
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,340
You think about it

663
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:49,340
A-men, fresh and fresh, Yu Le Chang, 994466, come

664
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,340
A bottle of water

665
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,340
Da Shuai, your water

666
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,340
You came from the outside world, right?

667
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,340
I'm familiar with this place

668
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:21,340
If you need any help, you don't have to be polite

669
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,340
We'll help you

670
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:31,340
I told you not to compensate

671
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,340
You should be the one who's in charge of the exchange

672
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,340
I'm a good-for-nothing

673
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,340
You're a good-for-nothing

674
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,340
You'll have to pay me 60,000

675
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,340
If you don't want to give up on compensation

676
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,340
I can compensate you. Can you give me some time?

677
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,340
You're not a good-for-nothing

678
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,340
You're not a good-for-nothing

679
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:58,340
You're a good-for-nothing

680
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,340
I think you're a bad-for-nothing

681
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,340
You're a bad-for-nothing

682
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:08,340
I think Zhou En is a bad-for-nothing

683
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,340
I'm a bad-for-nothing

684
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,340
Don't even think about it

685
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:19,340
I'm sorry. I want to go to the washroom

686
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,340
Who is that?

687
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:46,340
She's our flower gardener, the flower gardener, the class monitor

688
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,340
All the flowers need to rely on her to eat and watch her face

689
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:14,340
I'll give you the secret to make it a secret

690
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,340
I'm afraid you'll be obedient

691
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,340
Who are you? You're so rude

692
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,340
I just came to the service office

693
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:36,340
This mess is my job

694
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:39,340
You're so rude to her

695
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,340
I heard it clearly

696
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:44,340
You've designed the public road

697
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,340
You're so rude to her

698
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,340
If you don't apologize to her

699
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,340
I'll be happy to bring her to you

700
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,340
Mom

701
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,340
Mom

702
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,340
Mom

703
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,340
You heard the big deal from the beginning

704
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,340
You must have already confessed your love to her

705
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,340
For Xiao De

706
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,340
For Xiao De

707
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,340
I'll make her my wife again

708
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,340
I'm sure of it

709
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,340
If I were to go on a horse

710
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,340
I could take her to the washroom

711
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,340
with 300,000 yuan of spirit

712
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:52,340
She's been drunk since she was born

713
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:55,340
But you still have to go to the washroom for 3-5 years

714
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,340
I'll go to the washroom

715
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,340
This drink...

716
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,340
can be considered a proof

717
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:08,340
It proves that you have a plan to get into a weak woman

718
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,340
I'll send her to the washroom

719
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,340
But as soon as I get out of here

720
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,340
I'll be able to take all the blame

721
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,340
I'll go to the washroom

722
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,340
I love her

723
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:02,340
I'm not afraid of her

724
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,340
I'm not afraid of her

725
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:08,340
I'm not afraid of her

726
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,340
I'm not afraid of her

727
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,340
I'm not afraid of her

728
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,340
I'm not afraid of her

729
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,340
I'm not afraid of her

730
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,340
I'm not afraid of her

731
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,340
I'm not afraid of her

732
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,340
I'm not afraid of her

733
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,340
I'm not afraid of her

734
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,340
I'm not afraid of her

735
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,340
I'm not afraid of her

736
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,340
I'm not afraid of her

737
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,340
I'm not afraid of her

738
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,340
I'm not afraid of her

739
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,340
I'm not afraid of her

740
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,340
I'm not afraid of her

741
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:01,340
Boss Hua, you know my situation

742
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:04,340
Do you have any more time to talk about the compensation?

743
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:07,340
It's okay. It's just a compensation

744
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:11,340
Just do as what you said

745
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,340
Just don't tell me

746
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:20,340
Boss Hua, are you okay?

747
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,340
Boss Hua, what's wrong?

748
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,340
Don't be nervous

749
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,340
He's the one who made it

750
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,340
Let him sleep

751
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,340
What's wrong with him?

752
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,340
Someone just came to save you

753
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,340
It's a new lawyer

754
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:38,340
He's so handsome and he can do anything

755
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,340
The lawyer is here

756
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,340
Just walk out

757
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,340
I've been here for half an hour

758
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,340
And the car is still in the road

759
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,340
I'll give you ten minutes to come over

760
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:04,340
Boss Hua, what should we do?

761
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:07,340
You can't tell me what you want to do

762
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,340
You can't tell me what you want to do

763
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:12,340
What you want to do is to pull the new ball

764
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,340
What do you want to do?

765
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:16,340
It's not pulling the new ball

766
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,340
It's pulling the new ball

767
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,340
Boss Hua, what's wrong?

768
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,340
Boss Hua

769
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,340
Come here

770
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,340
Come here

771
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,340
Boss Hua

772
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,340
What's wrong?

773
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,340
What's wrong?

774
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,340
You're so handsome

775
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,340
Boss Hua, what's wrong?

776
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,340
I'm so happy

777
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,340
Boss Hua, you're so handsome

778
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,340
You're so handsome

779
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,340
You're so big and you're so good at it

780
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,340
You're really a big boy

781
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:57,340
But you're still so handsome

782
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,340
I'm so handsome

783
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,340
Boss Hua, what should we do?

784
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:05,340
You're so handsome

785
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,340
You're so handsome

786
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,340
Boss Hua, do you know what you want to do?

787
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,340
Do you know what you want to do?

788
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,340
You can go to the zoo

789
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,340
Do you know what you want to do?

790
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,340
I know

791
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,340
I know

792
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:38,340
I'm the ball that pulls the new ball

793
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:42,340
I'm the ball that pulls the new ball

794
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,340
It's been a long time

795
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,340
The alien father

796
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:53,340
drove his universe to the earth

797
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,340
But the universe suddenly fell down

798
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,340
He was in front of the car

799
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,340
The car was broken

800
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,340
The alien father

801
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,340
I'll be back

802
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,340
The little ghost is here

803
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,340
Dad

804
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:10,340
I love you

805
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,340
You're so good at being a good boy

806
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,340
Are you calling me?

807
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,340
Yes, dad

808
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,340
Xiaohui, I'm not married yet

809
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,340
Don't call me that

810
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,340
I'm not joking

811
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:30,340
You saw Uncle Li taking my car

812
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:32,340
You're like a mother

813
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,340
I don't know what your mother told you

814
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:37,340
But I'm not your father

815
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,340
I'm the new lawyer

816
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,340
I know

817
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:43,340
Mom said you're a big boy

818
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,340
I'll tell you when you're done

819
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:51,340
What a weird place

820
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,340
We have such a weird little baby

821
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,340
Dad

822
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:00,340
Are the alien parents going to play?

823
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,340
It's a little bit of a mess

824
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:05,340
when Xiaolong is playing

825
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,340
It's okay

826
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,340
Xiaolong will take you back

827
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:10,340
to play the game

828
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,340
Xiaohui

829
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,340
I just need you to shut up

830
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,340
I don't need the energy

831
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:16,340
If you bother me again

832
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,340
I'll take back the ball

833
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:21,340
The ball that pulls the new ball

834
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,340
Mom

835
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,340
I'm sorry

836
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,340
I'm sorry

837
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,340
I'm sorry

838
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,340
I'm so worried

839
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,340
I'm sorry

840
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,340
I'm so worried

841
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:40,340
I'm so worried

842
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,340
I'm so worried

843
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:42,340
I'm so worried

844
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:43,340
I'm sorry

845
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,340
I'm sorry

846
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,340
I'm sorry

847
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,340
What's wrong with you now?

848
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:52,340
You can talk

849
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,340
I won't leave the earth

850
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,340
Mom, I want to go to the water

851
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:58,340
Then go

852
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:01,340
Mom, I can't make it

853
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:04,340
Where are you going?

854
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,340
Go

855
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,340
I'm sorry

856
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,340
You're so worried

857
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,340
I'm so worried

858
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,340
I'm sorry

859
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:22,340
I'm so worried

860
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:23,340
I'm sorry

861
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,340
I'm sorry

862
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:25,340
I'm so worried

863
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:26,340
I'm so worried

864
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,340
I'm sorry

865
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:30,340
Movies

866
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:33,340
Over the years

867
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:36,340
Lately, lacümüz precisi

868
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,340
Panish

869
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:49,640
Super

870
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,840
I made a대

871
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,340
They tried to get me

872
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:56,340
You need to be autonomous

873
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:57,340
Insensible

874
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:59,340
You don't have to do that

875
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,840
Dad, I'm done

876
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,840
What's wrong?

877
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,840
Are you okay?

878
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,340
You're falling down

879
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:26,840
Do you have a tie?

880
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,340
No

881
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,840
You have a big ear

882
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,840
You have a long way to go

883
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,840
You have to jump into the hole

884
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,340
Mom, please

885
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,340
Dad, you're so good

886
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:47,340
I can't even teach you how to do it

887
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:48,840
Really?

888
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,840
When I met your mom

889
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,840
I taught her a lot of tie-ups

890
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,840
But she was so good at it

891
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:58,340
I'm not good at it

892
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,340
I'm not good at it

893
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,340
I love her

894
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:32,340
I fall into her trap

895
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:34,340
My heart hurts

896
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:38,340
But I won't forget

897
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:40,340
We're not together

898
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:48,340
So cute

899
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,340
You're so good

900
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:50,340
You're so good

901
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:52,340
I can't even teach you how to do it

902
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:54,340
I'm so happy

903
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:24,340
I'm coming

904
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,340
Open the door

905
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:29,340
The flower is beautiful

906
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,340
Open the door

907
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,340
Open the door

908
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,340
Open the door

909
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:36,340
Open the door

910
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:38,340
You're so good

911
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,340
Sorry

912
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:42,340
I can't teach you how to do it

913
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:43,340
I can't teach you how to do it

914
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:45,340
The traditional way of doing it is

915
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,340
You can call it

916
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,340
Flower-tie

917
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:51,340
What's that?

918
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:52,340
What's that?

919
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:53,340
Oh, I see

920
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:54,340
I see

921
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,340
I see

922
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,340
I see

923
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,340
I see

924
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:58,340
I see

925
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,340
I see

926
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:01,340
I see

927
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,340
Ms. Ren

928
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,340
I'm a flower-tie

929
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,340
I'm a flower-tie

930
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:09,340
I'm a flower-tie

931
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:11,340

00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:53,540
What will you play?

957
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,340
Flowering or garbanzo or farewell honey?

00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,740

959
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,620
You guys statistically taught me.

960
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:08,340
Don't you know how my family is rich.

961
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,500
My r guys are all beggars.

962
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,500
I told you, I told you

963
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,500
If you come here, you can eat well

964
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,500
You can go to this town

965
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,500
We can cook

966
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,500
You can go back to school

967
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,500
Yes

968
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,500
If you come to school, you can go back to school

969
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,500
Yes

970
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,500
If you go back to school, you can go back to high school

971
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,500
You can't go back

972
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,500
Yes

973
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,500
Wait

974
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,500
Xiao Zi

975
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,500
Why is he so cold?

976
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,500
I tell him

977
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,500
He's his mother

978
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,500
I told him

979
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,500
No, I told him

980
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,500
He's the youngest, he's the youngest

981
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,500

982
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,500

00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,500
He must take care of you

987
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,500
I tell him, Lu Jin Shui Shui

988
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:51,500
I tell him

989
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,500
Xiao Zi, you want to go?

990
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,500
Xiao Zi, you want to go?

991
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,500
I tell him, Lu Jin Shui Shui

992
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,500

00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,500
Come here

996
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,500
I tell you

997
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,500
If I'm a local, I come to the village

998
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,500
There's a place called Lu Jin Shui Shui

999
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,500
We have a place to go

1000
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,500
You can see the place

1001
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,500
You see the place

1002
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,500
Thank you

1003
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,500
Thank you

1004
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,500
You're welcome

1005
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,500
I don't know how to drink

1006
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,500
I'm not going to tell you

1007
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,500
I'm going to tell you

1008
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,500
Don't look at the camera

1009
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,500
Lu Jin Shui

1010
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,500
I'll tell you in the morning

1011
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,500
If you don't want to go, you should look at the camera

1012
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,500
Go

1013
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,500
We're in a business, right?

1014
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,500
Yes

1015
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,500
We're very sincere

1016
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,500
Okay

1017
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,500
The tea is ready

1018
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,500
We're sincere

1019
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,500
We're very sincere

1020
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,500
The tea is ready

1021
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,500
The tea is ready

1022
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,500
The tea is ready

1023
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,500
It's too much

1024
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,500
It's a little bit too much

1025
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,500
It's a little bit too much

1026
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,500
Anyway, the tea is ready

1027
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,500
Right

1028
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,500
The tea is ready

1029
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,500
Come

1030
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,500
It's so good

1031
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,500
Lu Jin Shui, you're really good

1032
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:11,500
The tea is my secret recipe

1033
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:14,500
The alcohol is 80%

1034
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:17,500
In the end, there's no alcohol at all

1035
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:22,500
But in the end, you'll be drunk

1036
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,500
Be careful

1037
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,500
You're drunk

1038
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,500
You guys

1039
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:36,500
The so-called tea is alcohol

1040
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,500
What are you talking about?

1041
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:42,500
The alcohol is 80%

1042
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,500
What's going on?

1043
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,500
It's not alcohol

1044
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,500
The alcohol is the only thing that's alcohol

1045
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,500
As long as the alcohol is ready

1046
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,500
The alcohol is gone

1047
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,500
Then you'll wake up

1048
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,500
The alcohol is gone

1049
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,500
Right

1050
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:07,500
You're a monster

1051
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,500
You're a monster

1052
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,500
Lu Jin Shui, no

1053
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,500
I'm telling you

1054
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,500
We're really good

1055
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,500
We're not good at drinking

1056
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,500
You're drunk

1057
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,500
I'll drink the tea

1058
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,500
It's not good

1059
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,500
It's not good

1060
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,500
You're drunk

1061
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,500
You're so good

1062
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,500
You're drunk

1063
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,500
Right

1064
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,500
You're a monster

1065
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,500
You're a monster

1066
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,500
We're not good at drinking

1067
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,500
You're drunk

1068
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,500
I'll tell you the important thing

1069
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,500
I'll tell you the important thing

1070
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,500
No

1071
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,500
I'm telling you

1072
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,500
We're not good at drinking

1073
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,500
We're really good

1074
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,500
So everyone

1075
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,500
Everyone is so good

1076
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,500
And this Huan Yi Group

1077
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,500
Is the best

1078
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,500
Right

1079
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,500
So everyone

1080
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,500
Let's give them a round of applause

1081
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,500
Let's give them a round of applause

1082
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,500
Come on

1083
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,500

1085
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,500
Come on

1086
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,500
Be careful

1087
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:12,500
Be careful

1088
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,500
I'm here

1089
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,500
To help you

1090
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,500
Help

1091
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,500
I'm here

1092
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,500
I can only say

1093
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,500
Hua Tuen Chuan

1094
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,500
Right

1095
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:30,500
I've been bullied for 8 years

1096
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,500
4 years

1097
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,500
5 years

1098
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,500
I'm angry

1099
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,500
I'm angry

1100
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,500
You're angry

1101
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,500
Go to Taipei to ask

1102
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,500
Be careful

1103
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,500
I've never lost

1104
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:50,500
I've never lost since I started my career

1105
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,500
I'm so happy

1106
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,500
I'm so happy

1107
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,500
I'm so happy

1108
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,500
In the green world

1109
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,500
Yes

1110
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,500
To keep the record

1111
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,500
I'm here

1112
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,500
I'm here

1113
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,500

1117
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,500
I'm here

1118
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,500
I'm here

1119
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,500
The lawyer

1120
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,500
If you don't lose the record

1121
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,500
I'll be the only one

1122
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,500
to be recognized

1123
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,500
Xi

1124
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,500
Ba

1125
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,500
Li Ba

1126
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,500
So cool

1127
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,500
So you can leave it to me

1128
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,500
Let's go

1129
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,500
Welcome to the case of the foundation

1130
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,500
You

1131
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,500
I'll be there

1132
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,500
Come on in

1133
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,500
Come on in

1134
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,500
I'm here

1135
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,500
I'm here

1136
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,500
I'm here

1137
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,500
Where are you

1138
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,500
You're here

1139
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,500
You're here

1140
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,500
You're here

1141
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,500
The two of you are so beautiful

1142
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,500
You're so handsome

1143
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,500
You're so handsome

1144
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,500
I'm here

1145
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,500
Come on in

1146
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,500
I'll tell you

1147
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,500
This is the first time I've seen you

1148
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,500
You're so handsome

1149
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,500
I'll show you

1150
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,500
Mu Chen

1151
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,500
You're so handsome

1152
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,500
You're so handsome

1153
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,500
You're so handsome

1154
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,500
Mu Chen

1155
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,500
You forgot

1156
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,500
I'm your mother

1157
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,500
I'll tell you

1158
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,500
Mu Chen is so handsome

1159
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,500
He's so handsome

1160
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,500
He's been a long time

1161
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,500
He must be very good at teaching you

1162
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,500
So you can be at ease

1163
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,500
You can be at ease

1164
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,500
You can be at ease

1165
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,500
No problem

1166
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,500
No problem

1167
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,500
The new lawyer

1168
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,500
Let him sit in the room of my son

1169
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,500
It's so late and he hasn't come back

1170
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,500
I'll go to your house

1171
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:07,500
I'll be back

1172
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,500
Grandpa, take some rest

1173
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,500
You can sit here

1174
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,500
Bye

1175
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,500
Welcome, dad

1176
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,500
Mu Chen

1177
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,500
I'm here to see you

1178
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:26,500
Xiao Le

1179
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,500
I've told you

1180
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,500
He's the lawyer's uncle from Taipei

1181
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:31,500
It's not you

1182
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,500
Technology says

1183
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,500
You're the man who best trusts

1184
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,500
Women and influential company

1185
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,500
I'm here for you

1186
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,500
I'm suitable for this

1187
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,080
I'm willing to 끝

1188
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,840
God's blessing

1189
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,500
i will take good care

1190
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:12,500
What's the limit

1191
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,000
Don't waste my time

1192
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,500
It's free

1193
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:16,500
i'll get you

1194
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:21,300
Xiao Le, I've told you that he's Taipei's lawyer uncle.

1195
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,300
It's not you, right?

1196
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,300
It's you.

1197
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:42,300
His situation is still in the past.

1198
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:45,700
I decided to leave him.

1199
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:48,900
I was scared at first, so this time,

1200
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:50,900
I decided to leave him first.

1201
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,500
When I wake up,

1202
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,700
I'll see you for the first time.

1203
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:59,700
It must be you.

1204
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:04,100
When you wake up,

1205
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,900
there will be a new life waiting for you.

1206
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:08,700
How do you think you can repay

1207
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:11,700
the kindness that your father gave you?

1208
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:20,700
It turns out that this child's mother is you.

1209
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:29,300
I didn't expect

1210
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,500
that I would meet you again.

1211
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:40,900
He believes that tomorrow is the future.

1212
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:43,900
How bad is the heart?

1213
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:46,700
I don't believe it.

1214
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,900
Congratulations!

1215
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:51,700
Congratulations!

1216
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:53,700
Mu Chen, don't worry.

1217
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:55,700
Dad will be like this.

1218
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,900
Why are you calling him dad?

1219
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,300
Did he tell you the same thing?

1220
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:04,500
He called Bu Bu here.

1221
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,100
He was in the middle of the road,

1222
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:07,100
and he was in the car.

1223
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:10,100
He must have been a lawyer.

1224
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:20,100
So he is that Parisian.

1225
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:24,700
He really is a lawyer.

1226
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:29,300
Mu Chen,

1227
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:31,100
Dad is really here to find us.

1228
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:33,100
You want to save dad, right?

1229
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,100
Xiao Le,

1230
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:38,700
I heard from my mom that

1231
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:42,300
this person is not your dad.

1232
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,100
Mu Chen, you know he is not dad.

1233
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,100
Why is he acting like a lawyer?

1234
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:49,500
No.

1235
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,900
He is because I have been working too long.

1236
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:53,100
I am very tired.

1237
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:55,500
Okay, I hope you can see dad

1238
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,900
and tell him the truth, right?

1239
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:01,700
Xiao Le, I heard from my mom that

1240
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:03,700
this person is not your dad.

1241
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:05,100
The village head said that

1242
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:08,100
he is still the lawyer who helped him to get a job.

1243
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:10,100
But you should call him his name.

1244
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,300
Xiao Le,

1245
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:13,300
don't say that anymore.

1246
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:28,700
I helped him to get a job for you.

1247
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:32,500
This uncle is a student of the house,

1248
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,900
so I know what his name is.

1249
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:37,300
But I don't know him.

1250
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:41,500
Dad,

1251
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:44,100
you should prepare to go to bed early.

1252
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:47,900
You said that you saw mom's baby, right?

1253
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:59,900
I will go to bed.

1254
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,900
Dad.

1255
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:10,100
Jiang Wo assists with paying the state fees.

1256
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,500
Xiao Le,

1257
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:26,300
If Mom tells him we need to do something tomorrow,

1258
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:29,100
he can't help it.

1259
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:33,100
I can't stop crying

1260
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:36,100
If that moment comes again

1261
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:38,100
I won't cry

1262
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:43,100
Let him know that I can

1263
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:47,100
be very good

1264
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:19,100
I forgot

1265
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:39,100
You've seen each other before

1266
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:06,100
I'm with Xiao Le now. What should I do if he wakes up tomorrow?

1267
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:09,100
I'll leave now

1268
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:16,100
Why did you run away? This is your home

1269
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:21,100
Didn't you say that you've been here for six years?

1270
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:25,100
Six years, he never came to see you

1271
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:32,100
Maybe he thinks that your relationship is past

1272
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:41,100
I just saw him

1273
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:44,100
He was holding a wedding ring

1274
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:58,100
I love him

1275
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:02,100
I fall into his trap

1276
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:06,100
I can't forget him

1277
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:14,100
I just saw him holding a wedding ring

1278
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:24,100
He woke up tomorrow

1279
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:27,100
You can just face him with your usual heart

1280
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:29,100
It's been six years

1281
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:32,100
Your relationship is just

1282
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:35,100
I haven't seen an old couple for a long time

1283
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:39,100
You don't have to leave. The one who should leave is him

1284
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:43,100
If you don't want to see him, I'll go to the village tomorrow

1285
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:46,100
Ask the court to get another lawyer

1286
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:58,100
Why did you have so many lawyers in Taiwan?

1287
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:01,100
Why did you have to come?

1288
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:03,100
But the construction company

1289
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:06,100
is about to move in the village

1290
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:09,100
If we find him again, will it be too late?

1291
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:12,100
You're right

1292
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:15,100
Since he's married

1293
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:18,100
He has nothing to do with us

1294
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:24,100
Anyway, he doesn't know about Xiaole

1295
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,100
When he finishes his job

1296
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:28,100
He'll leave

1297
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:30,100
I can go back to my love life

1298
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:36,100
But Xiaole only saw him once

1299
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:39,100
He decided to kill his father

1300
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:41,100
I was so scared

1301
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:46,100
He didn't know what would happen to Xiaole

1302
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:48,100
He won't know

1303
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:53,100
Except you, I'm the only one who knows who Xiaole's father is

1304
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:55,100
If I don't tell him, how will he know?

1305
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:57,100
What if he asks?

1306
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:00,100
What if he asks?

1307
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:04,100
The whole village knows I'm not Xiaole's father

1308
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:08,100
I can't lie to him

1309
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:16,100
Tell him Xiaole's father is dead

1310
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:28,100
Hello

1311
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:31,100
Someone is reading the newspaper

1312
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:33,100
He's with Brother Fang

1313
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:35,100
He's telling you

1314
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:40,100
Okay, you teach him to wait for me

1315
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:49,100
I have to go to the military base

1316
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:52,100
If I find him this time

1317
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:56,100
He might be involved in the flower field

1318
01:09:56,100 --> 01:10:00,100
It won't work out

1319
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:03,100
Don't be afraid

1320
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:08,100
He'll tell us what happened tomorrow

1321
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:13,100
Then I'll ask the village chief to sleep with me

1322
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:14,100
Okay?

1323
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:19,100
Let's go

1324
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:33,100
Why are you here?

1325
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:35,100
Why are you here?

1326
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:37,100
I'm looking for you

1327
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:39,100
It's easy to find you

1328
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:41,100
Yang Mengchen

1329
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:44,100
It's really you

1330
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:48,100
Come to the flower field

1331
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,100
I'll teach you

1332
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:52,100
I'm here to teach you

1333
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:55,100
There's no one who can match my appearance

1334
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:57,100
I'm here to teach you

1335
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:59,100
I'm here to teach you

1336
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:01,100
There's no one who can match my appearance

1337
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:02,100
It's you

1338
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:04,100
You're here to teach me

1339
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:09,100
Look, my grandfather and I are very close

1340
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:14,100
I think my grandfather and father are good

1341
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,100
You can consider it

1342
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:20,100
The family official day is two days away

1343
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:23,100
We'll invite Jiazhan and his friends to perform together

1344
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:25,100
We'll do one thing together

1345
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:29,100
Don't forget that you've already signed a marriage

1346
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:34,100
You should think of a way to make the villagers of the village

1347
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:36,100
Get the money

1348
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:39,100
How much do you still have to remember?

1349
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:41,100
I only remember a girl

1350
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:43,100
We met at the flower field

1351
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:44,100
She knew I was with her

1352
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:46,100
I'm not good at memory

1353
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:49,100
But she still wants to be with me

1354
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:58,100
I'm not good at memory

1355
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:00,100
I'm not good at memory

1356
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:02,100
I'm not good at memory

1357
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:04,100
I'm not good at memory

1358
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:06,100
I'm not good at memory

1359
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:08,100
I'm not good at memory

1360
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:10,100
I'm not good at memory

1361
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:12,100
I'm not good at memory

1362
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:14,100
I'm not good at memory

1363
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:16,100
I'm not good at memory

1364
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:18,100
I'm not good at memory

1365
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:20,100
I'm not good at memory

1366
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:22,100
I'm not good at memory

1367
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:24,100
I'm not good at memory

1368
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:26,100
I'm not good at memory

1369
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:29,100
I suddenly realized

1370
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:34,100
that love is not what we used to be

1371
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:38,100
I'm not good at memory

1372
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:41,100
I'm not good at memory

1373
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:47,100
I'm not good at memory

1374
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:52,100
I'm always in love

1375
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:56,100
I still let people open their eyes

1376
01:12:56,100 --> 01:13:00,100
It turns out that I can only look forward to it

1377
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:04,100
I always come up in love

1378
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:08,100
I want to stay in love

1379
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:13,100
I should have been like this
