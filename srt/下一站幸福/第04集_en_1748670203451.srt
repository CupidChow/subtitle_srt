00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Next, I'll broadcast for you right away. Next episode of Happiness

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm just a person who's so stupid.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'll let go of what I've decided to do.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Including the people I care about.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So the person you said you were before

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
is Fang Duo, your son.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Come on!

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If you don't have money, you can ask someone to take off your clothes.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What are you talking about?

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Don't pretend.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Help! Help!

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What are you doing?

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
She...

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
She's been using it many times.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
She said if she had money, she could ask someone to take off her clothes.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Let's go!

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm telling you, I don't have money!

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Since the college was founded,

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
the world has been in a mess.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's a real problem.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'll take part.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
As long as I can help you,

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'll do my best.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'll make sure that the light and the two-dimensional world

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
can't be taken off.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I found all the photos from this IP.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's her.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Zhang Ai Li.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's her.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Who is that Liang Mu Chen?

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
How can he be so serious about the relationship?

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I believe in what you can do.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
No matter what,

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'll get this photo.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The murder is still on the line.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Let's not go in.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Okay.

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'll talk to her.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I want to talk to you.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I want to talk to you about the investigation.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I hope you can help Mu Chen.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I really don't believe you think Mu Chen is like this.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
If you get hit by a thunder,

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
you'll see a little girl crying and drinking.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You'll suddenly think how much Mu Chen will do for you.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You'll decide to help her this time.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Mu Chen.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Mu Chen.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Ai Li.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You've done so much.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You should give me some feedback.

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Reconciliation? Please.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
If you want to fix your relationship,

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
you'll be hit like a pig.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'll help you fix the mess.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Go steal the bag of our house and Mu Chen's body.

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm warning you.

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Don't tell me what to do.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't need you.

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Hi.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Why are you here?

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm here to pay my respects to the players.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Isn't this place

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
for some losers?

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The players are losers.

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Hi.

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The players are losers.

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So I'm the one who just started training.

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's hard to say.

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What are you doing?

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Are you mad?

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What's wrong?

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You're so annoying.

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I don't believe you.

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Lin Ji.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I got it.

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Stand up.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You're so annoying.

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Lin Ji, you're giving me a training.

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We didn't...

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Sit there.

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Stand up.

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Get out.

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,160
You!

85
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,360
Are you...

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Open the door.

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What are you doing?

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You want to play?

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
How could I know?

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Don't say that. You two are the only ones who don't have the medicine.

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But you still have to go back to the police station.

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
They are not our customers. Why do we have to go to the police station?

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
How do I know? You just finished your class.

94
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Anyway, you have to go back to the police station.

95
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You're the only one who can do it. Don't say that much.

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What are you doing?

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Stand up!

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You four are so tall. You can't sit properly.

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You're too young to study well.

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Let me tell you.

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You two are the only ones who can go back to the police station.

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What?

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You go back to the police station with me.

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay.

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You four, don't do that to me.

106
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Don't run!

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Why are you saving me?

108
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Aren't you a classmate?

109
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Why do you have to go to the police station?

110
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You two are not caught together.

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Don't run!

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Stand up!

113
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You're too young to do that.

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm still the first one to go to the police station.

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm sorry.

116
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You two, don't run!

117
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Sorry.

118
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm so far away. Are you okay?

119
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm fine.

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm a little tired.

121
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Can you send me home?

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'll go out.

123
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You're so short.

124
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm fine.

125
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Why can't you send me home?

126
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm fine.

127
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm fine.

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm fine.

129
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm fine.

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm fine.

131
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm fine.

132
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm fine.

133
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm fine.

134
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm fine.

135
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm fine.

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I never let you misunderstand me

137
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I only have anger on myself

138
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Because there are many words

139
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I regret after I parted

140
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Why I never said it

141
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's because my mom left too early

142
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Mom is just a word to me

143
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And dad is only on the picture

144
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
To me, that's your mom

145
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But I have no impression

146
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The person who should be sitting next to me

147
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Is you, Xiao'ai

148
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Mu Cheng, do you remember how dad taught you

149
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
To say hello to aunt Xiao'ai?

150
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Call mom

151
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
When I was in the national team

152
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You played with me

153
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I accidentally fell

154
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And hurt us

155
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You always scolded me

156
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But you carefully took care of me

157
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And the wound on my knee

158
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I was afraid I would get a scar

159
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
When I was in the national team

160
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I was willing to graduate

161
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You said you didn't have time to go to the shop

162
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
But I saw you

163
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You forgot to take off your shirt and gloves

164
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And came to see me

165
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And then you fell

166
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And performed

167
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I regret it until now

168
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I don't have this kind of girl

169
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You taught me to grow up

170
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What to pay attention to

171
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Is you taught me to be honest

172
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Every time we talk about the cup

173
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
We put the cup in the cup

174
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And hold hands

175
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And open the cup together

176
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
But now

177
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm no longer with you

178
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I can't be with you to open the cup

179
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So I put the cup

180
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And put the cup on the bag

181
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So you can be sure

182
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Even if the cup is too big

183
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Without my help

184
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You can be free

185
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You won't let the cup go

186
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm sorry for making you angry

187
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm sorry

188
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Mom

189
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Wuchen

190
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Now you're saying it's not good

191
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Doing things is doing things wrong

192
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm sorry

193
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm sorry

194
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm sorry

195
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm sorry

196
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm sorry

197
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm sorry

198
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm sorry

199
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm sorry

200
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm sorry

201
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'll take you to the hospital

202
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'll take you to the hospital

203
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'll go to Xiaoling's place to check on you

204
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Before the debate

205
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
If Xiaoling doesn't call

206
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's okay

207
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
If the investigation results

208
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The mayor is disappointed

209
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
She's not here

210
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'll take you to the hospital

211
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'll take you to the hospital

212
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'll take you to the hospital

213
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
If the investigation results

214
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The mayor is disappointed

215
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'll be sad

216
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's a hard work for you

217
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And those who helped me

218
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And aunt

219
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
She might misunderstand me for the rest of my life

220
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I don't care about others

221
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
No matter what

222
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You're still by my side

223
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Am I right?

224
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
From the beginning

225
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I felt protected for the first time

226
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's also the first time

227
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Someone made me feel

228
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm not respected

229
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Ren Guangxi

230
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Thank you

231
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You said you didn't have a wife

232
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm saying thank you

233
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I don't want to be a burden to you

234
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
How can you repay me?

235
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
If we win tomorrow

236
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'll make a good dish for you

237
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
A good dish?

238
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You're too shy

239
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm not short of people like you

240
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I can only cook

241
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I just need to thank you

242
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Don't be too hard on me

243
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Of course I will

244
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'll wait for you to make a good dish

245
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Miss, do you want some?

246
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
No, I don't

247
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I have a friend

248
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
So don't call me no matter what

249
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'll be back

250
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
What are you doing?

251
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm not sure

252
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You look so innocent

253
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You like walking on my path

254
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Be gentle, it hurts

255
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm telling you

256
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I want to be your wife

257
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What do you mean?

258
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
What are you doing?

259
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Don't touch my stuff

260
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You stole the file from the police

261
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And sent it to the school

262
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
The files should be in your computer

263
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Why did you do that?

264
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
What's your advantage?

265
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Let me go

266
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Wang Ma

267
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm scared

268
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Help

269
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Wang Ma, help

270
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You're so strong

271
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Wang Ma, help

272
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Shut up

273
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
How much is the password?

274
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'll tell you

275
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You can't be so stupid

276
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You'll understand if you use the high-tech password

277
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Wang Ma

278
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I know where the power is

279
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
The class is waiting for the computer

280
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You're trying to help me

281
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You're so stubborn

282
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I don't want to be your wife

283
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You're so mean

284
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You thief

285
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Come back

286
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You're so mean

287
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Let me go

288
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
What are you looking at?

289
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I think you look different

290
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Really?

291
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You and Xiaoling were on a break yesterday

292
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
So you have a little bit of a temper

293
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You're getting mature

294
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
That's because I'm determined to protect myself

295
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
for the first time

296
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Hua Tuoyue, did you get the stuff?

297
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I did

298
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Zhang Ai Li took the monitor out of his computer

299
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I can't open it

300
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm looking for the fridge to unlock his password

301
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Get the monitor out

302
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Hurry up. That's the most powerful evidence

303
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's not bad

304
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
He took the monitor out

305
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Let's go

306
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Let's go to the investigation room

307
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Let's go

308
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
The first day of the investigation

309
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I want to go out

310
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I want to talk to you

311
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You're not going to be in the office

312
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'll call the police

313
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You can go to the police

314
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I'll take you out

315
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'll take you out

316
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'll take you out

317
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'll take you out

318
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I'll call the police

319
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'll take you out

320
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I'll tell you what

321
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm going to take a bath

322
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'll tell you what I'm going to do

323
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'll take you out

324
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'll take you out

325
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'll take you out

326
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'll take you out

327
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I'll take you out

328
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
What are you talking about?

329
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You should be careful when you go to the police

330
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You're not going to be in the police

331
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'll tell you what

332
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm not going to be in the police

333
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm not going to be in the police

334
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm not going to be in the police

335
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm going to be in the police

336
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'll tell you what I'm going to do

337
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm going to be in the police

338
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'll take you out

339
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'll take you out

340
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'll take you out

341
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'll take you out

342
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'll take you out

343
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'll take you out

344
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'll take you out

345
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'll take you out

346
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Please be seated

347
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
He Dong

348
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
He Dong is so important to us

349
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
He's busy with the public

350
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Don't move

351
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Why didn't Yijian come with you?

352
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Yijian went to the transfer office several days ago

353
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
But he's been busy with his work

354
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
He told me that if Guangxi can help his friend

355
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
If he succeeds

356
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
He'll call me right away

357
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Tell him about his situation

358
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Yijian was very concerned about Guangxi

359
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I'm looking forward to him

360
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Okay

361
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Go for it

362
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Go for it

363
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Go for it

364
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Go for it

365
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Go for it

366
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Go for it

367
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Don't move

368
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Yijian is too busy

369
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Go for it

370
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
What's going on?

371
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
What's going on?

372
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
What's going on?

373
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
What's going on?

374
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
What's going on?

375
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Although this investigation

376
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
must be held for two hours

377
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I guess

378
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
it will be over within an hour

379
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Yes, within an hour

380
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I will let Zhou Jinzhen

381
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
admit his crime

382
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
and give him a beautiful and beautiful wedding

383
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
The third one

384
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
The fifth one

385
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
The sixth one

386
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
The sixth one

387
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
The sixth one

388
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
The sixth one

389
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
The sixth one

390
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
The truth is that

391
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
the investigation must be held

392
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
for three days in the city of Shengde

393
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
The truth is that

394
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Miss Liang Wucheng Li Qing

395
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
and Mr. Zhou Jinzhen

396
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
are the members of the investigation

397
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
The truth of the board of directors

398
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
is the truth

399
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
The investigation begins

400
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Let's start with Ren Guangxi

401
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
The first witness of the interrogation

402
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
What are you doing?

403
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
What's wrong?

404
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
What's wrong with the people's attention?

405
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
What? Open the door

406
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Wait a minute

407
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Are you wrong?

408
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Hurry up

409
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I asked you to help me

410
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
from the garden yesterday

411
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
to accompany you to play

412
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
to get the wedding ceremony

413
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
You can go now

414
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Yes, I will

415
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Thank you

416
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I will go back to the garden

417
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I will not go now

418
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
What?

419
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Miss Liang Wucheng

420
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Yes, don't repeat this

421
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
You need time to run

422
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Don't you know?

423
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
The investigation has begun

424
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
You think I have so much time to run

425
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Hurry up

426
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Enough

427
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Go

428
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Miss Lin Meijing

429
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
You have been in the market for 13 years

430
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Yes, 13 years

431
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Do you know Mr. Zhou Jinzhen

432
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
who is the director of the case?

433
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
He is a young man

434
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
He is a young man

435
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
He is a good dancer

436
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
He is a good dancer

437
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
He is a good dancer

438
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
You remember so clearly

439
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
You have a deep impression on him

440
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
You know that

441
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
He is a good dancer

442
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
He is a good dancer

443
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
We know him

444
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
He is a good dancer

445
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Please explain to me

446
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Mr. Zhou Jinzhen and Mr. Liang Wucheng

447
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Do you have any other situation?

448
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I think

449
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
He is a good dancer

450
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
He is a good dancer

451
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Miss Liang Wucheng

452
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
You know

453
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
The director is a good dancer

454
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
He is a good dancer

455
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
He is a good dancer

456
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
He is a good dancer

457
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I am a good dancer

458
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I will go back to the garden

459
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I will tell you

460
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I will tell you

461
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I will tell you

462
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
It's true

463
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Even a normal person can see

464
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Miss Liang Wucheng is in front of Mr. Zhou

465
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Not only Yan Yi

466
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
But also Jing'er

467
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
She tried to kill him

468
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Ren Guangxi is sick

469
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
He is now going to the country

470
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
to get married

471
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
He is now going to the country

472
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
to get married

473
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Miss Liang

474
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I am not afraid of you

475
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I just want to adjust the microphone

476
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Do you think I want to offend you?

477
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Sorry

478
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I am not afraid

479
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I do not know

480
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Miss Liang Wucheng is in the same room

481
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
She did not know that Mr. Zhou

482
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Why do you see it?

483
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Is it because

484
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
you are usually

485
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
an excuse to make mistakes

486
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
for others?

487
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I am asking you

488
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Do you think

489
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
only Mr. Zhou will say something

490
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
No

491
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
No

492
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I am not afraid

493
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I am not afraid

494
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I am not afraid

495
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
So you think they will

496
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
treat women as best as possible

497
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Kang Yi

498
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
The person who is the opposite

499
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
is really a good person

500
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I am telling you

501
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Okay

502
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
You can leave

503
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
You can leave

504
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Sorry

505
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Sorry

506
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
According to your schedule

507
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Before the wedding

508
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
you work in the seafood stall

509
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Sometimes you are like a gentleman

510
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
the boss of seafood stall

511
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
and a little sister

512
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I saw him as a teacher

513
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
So I let him

514
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
work in the fish stall

515
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
every morning

516
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Who knows that our old man

517
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
is seduced by him

518
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I didn't expect that

519
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
a woman is so seduced

520
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I am sorry

521
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I am not a good person

522
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I am not a good person

523
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I don't want to fight with him

524
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
According to your information

525
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
you worked in the female art gallery

526
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Yes

527
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
So you will get a prize next year

528
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Yes, what's the problem?

529
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
According to Miss Liang Mu Chen

530
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
that stone-pan-yue

531
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
is the boss who is not stingy

532
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
and helps to get a prize

533
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
According to your logic

534
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
you get a prize

535
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I can also say

536
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
you will get a prize

537
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
That's great

538
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
That's great

539
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
That's great

540
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
That's great

541
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
You are the best

542
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You are the best

543
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Come on

544
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I will make you feel it

545
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Lin

546
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
It is said that you have seen

547
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
someone in the Christmas party

548
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Yes

549
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Please explain the situation

550
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I was with him in the Christmas party

551
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
We talked about the relationship

552
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
We didn't leave until 9am

553
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Around 8.30

554
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
We saw a man and a woman

555
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
leaving from the Christmas party

556
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
The girl was not in the dress

557
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
She was obviously in the party

558
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
So please

559
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Is this man and woman

560
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
at the scene?

561
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Yes, they are

562
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Liang Mu Chen and Ren Guang Xi

563
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I am so sorry

564
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I am so sorry

565
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I am sorry

566
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
The witness is

567
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
the person who was in the party

568
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
and the person who was in the party

569
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
and the person who was in the party

570
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I want to prove to you

571
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Liang Mu Chen is not only

572
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
willing to exchange money with Zhou Jing Cai

573
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
He and Ren Guang Xi

574
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
have already treated the school

575
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
as a family

576
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
and a family

577
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Zhou Jing Cai

578
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Please explain the situation

579
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Two days ago

580
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I saw Mu Chen

581
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I was worried

582
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So I followed him

583
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I thought he was going to the party

584
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
So I ran to the party

585
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
and I saw

586
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Ren Guang Xi

587
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
How nice

588
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
to see yourself like this

589
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
How nice

590
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
How long have they been like this

591
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I don't know

592
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
You are lying

593
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Sit down

594
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Ren Guang Xi came to the party

595
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
He must have

596
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
seen Mu Chen's

597
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
interest in me

598
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
So I got to the party

599
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
and I was in the party

600
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
and I was in the party

601
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
and I was in the party

602
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
and I was in the party

603
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
and I was in the party

604
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
and I was in the party

605
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
and I was in the party

606
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
and I was in the party

607
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
and I was in the party

608
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
and I was in the party

609
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
and I was in the party

610
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
and I was in the party

611
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
and I was in the party

612
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I was in the party

613
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
but now

614
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I feel very painful

615
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
and the police

616
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Stop

617
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Ren Guang Xi is the violent act of Oda Zhou

618
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
It proves that he is a brain-washed man

619
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
This is the best evidence

620
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
You are so cruel

621
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Everyone knows

622
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
home is a place

623
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
where people feel comfortable

624
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Mr. Zhou Jing Cai

625
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Do you think that

626
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Mu Chen is the same

627
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
as everyone else

628
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Of course

629
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I worked so hard

630
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
to find a job

631
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I just want to give him a warm home

632
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
The photo on the screen

633
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
How do you explain it

634
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Everyone

635
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
You will put three books

636
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
in the book

637
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Mr. Zhou

638
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Mr. Zhou

639
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Please explain

640
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
why Mu Chen did this

641
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I don't know

642
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
He has a way to prove it

643
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
The dream you found

644
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
is as big as the window

645
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
of the bathroom

646
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
According to Ms. Liang

647
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
This is the one he took the shower

648
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
and brought it to this window

649
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
With you

650
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
and Jing

651
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
There are three people living together

652
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
He did this

653
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
for the protection

654
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
not you, but his Jing

655
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I

656
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I am willing to do it

657
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I am willing to do it

658
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Are you tired?

659
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Let me tell you

660
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
You will be the one

661
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
who will be the one

662
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
who will be the one who will be the one

663
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
It's strange

664
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
You know

665
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
that I and Ms. Liang

666
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
are the same

667
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
You took the toilet to my house

668
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
You took the toilet from the user's mouth

669
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I can't take it

670
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Plus

671
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
you have been rude to him

672
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
So you are not only a criminal

673
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
but also a criminal

674
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
That's right

675
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I know that you will not forget

676
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
So I want to save Mu Chen

677
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I don't care about him

678
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
for you

679
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
But I didn't expect that I would appear

680
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
He wants to make money for me

681
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
If I go back to the day when you were in trouble

682
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Then why would Ah Ha not know

683
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
why we are living together

684
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Tell you

685
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Ah Ha hasn't made any money

686
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Don't do anything

687
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
You are going to make me pay

688
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Let me tell you

689
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Ah Ha hasn't made any money

690
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Don't do anything

691
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
You are a criminal

692
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
but also a criminal

693
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
You are the one who took the toilet

694
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
to save him

695
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
So many times

696
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Ms. Liang

697
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
You still don't admit to your crime

698
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Because these are not facts

699
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I admit that I am in the same room with Ren Guangxi

700
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
But that is because

701
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I want to talk to him

702
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
He also knows

703
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I have been living in fear

704
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
So he wants to help me

705
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
From the beginning

706
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Ah Cai is not a bad person

707
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I really want to leave this house

708
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
The reason I went to the market to work

709
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Is to save money

710
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Pay for the food and books

711
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I can leave this house

712
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Maybe Ah Cai thinks

713
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
He wants to raise me up

714
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I can give him money every month

715
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
But it doesn't mean

716
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
He can bully me

717
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Really?

718
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
But I heard

719
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
There is no phone

720
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
But after Ren Guangxi went to the market

721
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
You have a phone

722
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
How did you get this phone?

723
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Ren Guangxi gave it to me

724
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
You changed it with your body

725
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Or

726
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Your phone

727
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
You can contact me when you are in the school

728
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Ah Cai

729
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
The other party is doing a non-stop investigation

730
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
There is a reference for the evidence

731
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Please answer

732
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
No

733
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Ren Guangxi gave me the phone

734
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
To protect myself

735
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
If he is harassing me again

736
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I can call the police immediately

737
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I don't understand

738
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
You said you are innocent

739
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Why didn't you call the police?

740
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I don't want to do anything

741
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I don't think so

742
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
As far as I know

743
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Even your mother-in-law doesn't believe you

744
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
She only helped you to call the police

745
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And to drive you out of the house

746
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
If the police caught you

747
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
You would be innocent

748
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
You are not useful

749
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
If you deny it

750
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Ladies and gentlemen

751
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:15,020
From the evidence of the people in the

752
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,020
I am always using your body to exchange money

753
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,020
In the future, even your parents

754
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,020
Will give you a chance to contact

755
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,020
Then I will give you the best evidence

756
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,020
The evidence of the people in the school

757
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,020
I don't have

758
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:29,020
I don't have

759
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,020
Even if you don't have money to exchange money

760
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,020
You will find the benefit you want

761
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,020
And use it

762
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,020
For example, the phone

763
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,020
Or the things we don't know

764
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,020
I have never used anyone

765
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,020
Then please take out

766
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:47,020
A person who has no interest in you

767
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,020
And you are willing to prove your innocence

768
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,020
I can prove it

769
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,020
People who do it

770
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,020
All know what I am

771
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,020
I used to

772
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,020
I won't be standing here today

773
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,020
You are a innocent person

774
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,020
You don't care about my peace

775
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,020
You don't want to try to

776
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,020
To me, the other women

777
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,020
Are more interested

778
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:37,020
Julia

779
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,020
You are here too

780
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,020
Sorry

781
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,020
I let you go

782
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,020
Tiffany

783
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,020
I admit that I was with my friends

784
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,020
I was with your family

785
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,020
I sincerely apologize

786
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,020
Your son's crazy

787
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,020
Is really unparalleled

788
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,020
Just now, the lawyer said

789
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,020
I was just pretending to be innocent

790
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,020
To avoid my own fault

791
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,020
And then I changed my mind

792
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,020
He is too high on me

793
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,020
As long as I can return him to his family

794
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,020
You can treat me as a luxury

795
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,020
And I don't care

796
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,020
To be honest

797
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,020
You are just a woman to me

798
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:35,020
Not trying to get benefits from me

799
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,020
Is the quality of the man's money

800
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,020
Just like me

801
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,020
Unparalleled

802
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,020
But now

803
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:49,020
It's him

804
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,020
Let me know

805
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:53,020
I shouldn't be the one who is just pretending

806
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,020
Compared to Liang Mu-chen

807
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,020
I am much happier

808
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,020
I am much happier

809
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,020
I don't need to worry about my life

810
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,020
I don't have to do my job

811
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,020
No need to open the door

812
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,020
When I have a day off

813
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,020
To face the anger of uncle

814
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,020
Connie

815
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,020
She is trying to make a mistake

816
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:23,020
Connie, please

817
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:31,020
Okay

818
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,020
What I want to say is

819
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,020
She used her way

820
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,020
To protect herself

821
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,020
She had to take care of everyone's feelings

822
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:41,020
For her little baby

823
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:43,020
So she had to take care of the rest of the family

824
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,020
Even if she lived in the empty house every day

825
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,020
She had three children

826
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,020
She is still a insistent

827
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:55,020
She wants to give her father a home

828
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:59,020
She is trying to live every day

829
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:04,020
She wants to protect her baby

830
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,020
She wants to take control of the house

831
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,020
She wants to spend the rain

832
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,020
She wants to catch the dirty fish in every house

833
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:18,020
She is trying to save the baby

834
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:22,020
Today

835
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,020
Finally, someone saw her suffer

836
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:26,020
She is willing to tell the truth

837
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,020
But she is looking for other's bad ideas

838
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,020
This is the joy of my life

839
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:37,020
It is a world where the good and evil are equal

840
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,020
But

841
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,020
Because I met Mu Chen

842
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,020
His kindness

843
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,020
And his life's witness

844
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:56,020
Made me live a life of a bad person

845
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,020
The first time I dreamt of him

846
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,020
I am looking forward to it

847
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,020
I am looking forward to it

848
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,020
I can still believe what this world is

849
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:05,020
He only used a script

850
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:07,020
He even played it with his own hands

851
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:11,020
That is, the famous script

852
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:16,020
I want to cherish someone for the first time

853
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:22,020
The first time I want to make myself better for him

854
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,020
I think that the first time I met him

855
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:30,020
I will fall in love with him

856
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,020
Mu Chen is my last goal

857
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:41,020
Because I believe that this world is not too difficult

858
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:44,020
I can accompany him

859
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:46,020
Work hard together

860
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:49,020
Don't let anyone hurt him again

861
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:06,020
Because he has been hurt too long

862
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:18,020
Don't give up

863
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:23,020
Don't ask

864
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:27,020
Just hold me

865
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,020
Don't ask

866
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,020
Don't ask

867
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:35,020
Don't ask

868
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:40,020
If we found someone, we can take him for a business trip

869
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,020
I can sit next to you

870
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:44,020
I will leave you alone

871
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:05,020
Is he kidnapped by an alien?

872
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:07,020
He is just playing basketball

873
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:09,020
He is playing basketball

874
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:20,020
I only hope that you can prove to me that I can still expect from this world

875
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:24,020
The law is not a toy that is manipulated by two people

876
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:27,020
It is a game that can protect good people

877
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:30,020
Otherwise, this failure

878
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:33,020
The truth of the falsehood

879
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:36,020
Is more disgusting than Zhou Jingcai

880
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,020
Is your son wrong?

881
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,020
Why don't you care about the past?

882
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,020
Don't worry, He Dong

883
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:47,020
When the investigation is over, they have no relationship

884
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:51,020
Both sides are completely closed

885
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:55,020
Since the two sides can't provide further evidence

886
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:04,020
Now, please come to our training group to discuss the voting

887
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,020
The voting is over

888
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:31,020
What are you doing?

889
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:36,020
After the voting, Pei Seng is considered to be Liang Muchen

890
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:38,020
Liang Muchen is a new person

891
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:40,020
He is so annoying

892
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:43,020
This is the truth of the falsehood

893
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:03,020
I love him

894
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:07,020
Don't pretend to be the one

895
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:10,020
My heart is deeply hurt

896
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:13,020
But I will never forget

897
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,020
I am not a new person

898
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:17,020
I am not a new person

899
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:22,020
You are so annoying

900
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:25,020
This is the truth of the falsehood

901
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:29,020
Zhang Ai Li is the one who is not a fake

902
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:33,020
He is also the spy of Shenzhen Hall

903
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:35,020
Liang Muchen is innocent

904
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:47,020
Please take a look

905
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,020
At night, Muchen was in Shenzhen Hall

906
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:51,020
He was waiting for the right time

907
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:54,020
But Zhou Jingcai was in the back of the castle

908
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,020
He tried to take the money and break down Muchen

909
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:59,020
Like what you saw, Muchen refused

910
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:01,020
He was also against it

911
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:03,020
But Zhou Jingcai was angry

912
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:05,020
He tried to break down Muchen with violence

913
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:07,020
He even tried to rebel

914
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,020
This is the truth

915
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:12,020
The video with the video is totally in line with the life of Liang Muchen

916
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:16,020
Zhou Jingcai used money to break down Liang Muchen

917
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:19,020
He was always in the corner

918
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:22,020
My party member is the victim

919
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:29,020
An Ji

920
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:34,020
Zhou Jingcai

921
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:36,020
Zhou Jingcai

922
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:38,020
Zhou Jingcai is a victim

923
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:40,020
You should be more careful

924
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:42,020
You will be punished if you are caught

925
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:44,020
How is it?

926
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:46,020
I am not a good person

927
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:48,020
I am afraid I will be punished

928
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:50,020
You will raise him up

929
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:52,020
You will protect him

930
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:55,020
I am willing to do anything to protect him

931
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:57,020
To fulfill my wish

932
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:02,020
Being a victim is my duty

933
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,020
You will not only be a victim

934
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:09,020
You will be punished

935
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,020
He owes you

936
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,020
He owes me a lot

937
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:16,020
I have raised him up

938
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:18,020
I will tell you what I want to say

939
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,020
I don't want to say anything

940
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:25,020
Help

941
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:41,020
Why is the picture of the case on Zhang Erlin's hand?

942
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:43,020
What is the motive of his bag?

943
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,020
Why did you take it?

944
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,020
I stole it

945
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:55,020
The key is still in the bag

946
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:57,020
Whatever

947
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:01,020
But the case was solved by the soldier

948
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:03,020
You should take a look

949
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:15,020
This is the scene of the case of Zhang Erlin and An Bo

950
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:18,020
Yes, Zhang Erlin was chased by the police

951
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:21,020
He went to the police station to steal the video

952
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:24,020
He stole the footage of Zhou Jincai's crime scene

953
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:27,020
He also posted the pictures of the victims of the crime scene

954
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,020
in the school

955
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:32,020
Xiao Lin, inform the police

956
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:34,020
to bring Zhou Jincai back to avoid him running away

957
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:38,020
He also called Zhang Erlin to take the case

958
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:40,020
The picture of An Bo

959
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:42,020
inform the school to handle this matter

960
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:44,020
No need to bother

961
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:48,020
The kidnapping and the murder of Xinqing

962
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:50,020
are all private cases

963
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:52,020
They are all handled by the police

964
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:54,020
This is the evidence

965
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:11,020
After the compensation, Miss Liang Mucheng is 100%

966
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:18,020
Congratulations

967
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:20,020
Congratulations

968
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:22,020
Congratulations

969
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:24,020
Congratulations

970
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:26,020
Congratulations

971
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:32,020
Let's go to the police

972
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:34,020
Let's go

973
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,020
Let's go

974
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:58,020
What's this?

975
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:00,020
What's this?

976
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:16,020
What's this?

977
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,420
ホな

978
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,500
I'm not sure if you contain this

979
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:11,540
Le toast

980
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:16,020
We're shaky

981
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,380
It must be hard on you

982
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,780
Thank you very much

983
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:47,020
Besides hard work, thank you.

984
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:49,020
Don't you have anything else to say to me?

985
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:51,020
I just said what I said on the court.

986
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:53,020
I really know what your response is.

987
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:09,020
How is it?

988
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:11,020
Let's have a look.

989
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:13,020
Welcome to the investigation room.

990
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:16,020
I want to hear your explanation.

991
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:18,020
I know.

992
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:25,020
What are you doing here?

993
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:28,020
I said if I win, you have to make a good dish for me.

994
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,020
You should go back to the city first.

995
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:34,020
I'll leave first.

996
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:36,020
I'll call the price later.

997
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,020
Don't forget.

998
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:42,020
I'm still waiting for your answer.

999
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:45,020
I'll call the price later.

1000
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:47,020
Zhunegai

1001
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:14,020
It seems to be very different today.

1002
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:19,020
This time, I should be able to thank him.

1003
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:22,020
There's another important project in the future.

1004
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:24,020
I want to find a way to thank him.

1005
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:26,020
Who?

1006
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:29,020
Director Hua.

1007
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:30,020
Yes.

1008
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:33,020
Thank you.

1009
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:34,020
Don't be like this.

1010
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:36,020
Don't be so polite.

1011
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:38,020
How can you be like this to your friends?

1012
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:40,020
You're just like a potato.

1013
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:42,020
Don't be like this.

1014
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:44,020
I'll be the one to accept it.

1015
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:53,020
I didn't even see you smile so happily.

1016
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:01,020
It's a pity that I have to leave.

1017
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:05,020
You're leaving? Where are you going?

1018
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:07,020
I'm going to school.

1019
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,020
School? Why?

1020
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:26,020
Guo endless

1021
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:32,020
Where are you going?

1022
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:33,020
我要去修学了

1023
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:37,020
修学? 为什么?

1024
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:40,020
Because my mom is pregnant

1025
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:46,020
Do you know how to help my father and I?

1026
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:54,020
Are you kidding me?

1027
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:57,020
You scared me

1028
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:01,020
Actually, I studied for so long

1029
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:04,020
Huatian only had my mom left alone in Dalian

1030
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:06,020
You know, I was so old

1031
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:09,020
I couldn't do much at home

1032
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:14,020
So I thought I'd go back to the flower after I've been here for four years

1033
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,020
And I don't know how to read

1034
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:20,020
I'd better go back to my mom

1035
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:23,020
We'll meet again soon after you go back

1036
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,020
I can't bear to

1037
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:32,020
Maybe it's because I'm your only friend

1038
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:34,020
You're not used to leaving

1039
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:37,020
You have to take good care of yourself

1040
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:42,020
Mu Chen, do you remember this?

1041
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:48,020
Keep it

1042
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:59,020
Huatai, you're a kid

1043
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:03,020
I've seen you look so old and handsome

1044
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:05,020
You're not old

1045
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:08,020
You're a kid who's been doing business

1046
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:17,020
Hello, do you know what you're looking for?

1047
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:20,020
You don't know what you're looking for?

1048
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:23,020
No, I'm looking for a wife

1049
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:25,020
I'm looking for a wife

1050
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:27,020
I'm looking for a wife

1051
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:29,020
I'm not looking for a wife

1052
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:32,020
I'm looking for a wife

1053
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:49,020
Sorry, someone's chasing me

1054
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,020
Can you let me hide?

1055
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:57,020
Get rid of her!

1056
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:13,020
Come on!

1057
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:25,020
The empty heart

1058
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:28,020
The heart is with you

1059
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:31,020
You are not afraid of all the mistakes

1060
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:34,020
Maybe I am too naive

1061
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:37,020
You are the one who will give up the chance

1062
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:39,020
Come on, you are the one who will give up the chance

1063
01:01:53,020 --> 01:02:02,020
The heart is with you

1064
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:07,020
I thought you would understand

1065
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:12,020
The heart is with you

1066
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:14,020
Thank you for your compliment

1067
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:16,020
You are so fast

1068
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:18,020
I am not complimenting

1069
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:19,020
I am selling the bento

1070
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:21,020
Yes, selling the bento

1071
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:23,020
Where is the bento?

1072
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:25,020
Not sure

1073
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:26,020
Maybe next time

1074
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:28,020
Yes, the bento

1075
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:30,020
Ok, but if I am hungry

1076
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:32,020
I will find you a bento

1077
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,020
I will talk to you

1078
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:39,020
I am leaving first

1079
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:40,020
Bye

1080
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:44,020
Wait

1081
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:48,020
You are the one who will give up the chance

1082
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:49,020
I am selling the bento

1083
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:51,020
I hope you won't be the most stupid

1084
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:57,020
I am Hua Tuoyi

1085
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:58,020
How about you?

1086
01:02:58,020 --> 01:02:59,020
Liang Hongchen

1087
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:02,020
Thank you

1088
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:06,020
I didn't expect you to stay

1089
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:11,020
Can you change the dish?

1090
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:13,020
How can I change it?

1091
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:15,020
He is still here

1092
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:16,020
I am so lucky

1093
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:19,020
Think about it

1094
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:21,020
Time really flies

1095
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:25,020
You will be the best if you don't stay

1096
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:29,020
This is not a victory

1097
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:31,020
No matter what happens

1098
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:34,020
You will still appear if you call me

1099
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:37,020
When are you leaving?

1100
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:39,020
I will ask the guest to help you

1101
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:40,020
Don't be afraid

1102
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:42,020
How can I hide it?

1103
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:46,020
You can leave the good things to the passenger

1104
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:48,020
I want to thank him

1105
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:51,020
I want to recognize the guy

1106
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:19,020
Usually, they are all for the passenger

1107
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:21,020
You just have to cook the dishes well

1108
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:22,020
And then thank you

1109
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:24,020
Put it inside

1110
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:25,020
That's it

1111
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:37,020
Director Fang

1112
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:40,020
I understand

1113
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:44,020
I don't know how to explain to my daughter

1114
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:49,020
What do you think of the investigation?

1115
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:54,020
I am pursuing the cause of the investigation

1116
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:57,020
But for this result, she can't make any decision

1117
01:04:57,020 --> 01:05:00,020
Director He doesn't have to care about what she said

1118
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:02,020
She said she liked that girl

1119
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:04,020
It's just a decision

1120
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:06,020
It's not a decision

1121
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:09,020
You have to think of a way to make a decision

1122
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:13,020
You have to make a decision

1123
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:18,020
Don't you think you will be punished

1124
01:05:18,020 --> 01:05:20,020
if you don't think of your brain?

1125
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:24,020
Don't be too honest

1126
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:26,020
Don't threaten me with your own brain

1127
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:29,020
You can take it

1128
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:35,020
I think if you found out you treat her as a business

1129
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:39,020
Would you think your father is a little ridiculous?

1130
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:41,020
Shut up

1131
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,020
I am sorry

1132
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:47,020
Director He

1133
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:51,020
So you mean

1134
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:54,020
You can't be with her in the past?

1135
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:56,020
No, I can't

1136
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:58,020
But she won't be happy

1137
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:00,020
Because I don't love her

1138
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:03,020
She won't be happy from me

1139
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:06,020
I want to ask you

1140
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:08,020
Do you really want this?

1141
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:11,020
Actually

1142
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:13,020
Your performance today

1143
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:15,020
is not like the way I used to hear

1144
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:18,020
the difference between you and your father

1145
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:20,020
On the other hand

1146
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:22,020
You have a lot of potential

1147
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,020
in the investigation

1148
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:26,020
I believe my daughter's vision

1149
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:28,020
I think

1150
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:30,020
If possible

1151
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:33,020
You should try to teach Wang to do it

1152
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:35,020
I will do it

1153
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:38,020
You should try to teach Wang to do it

1154
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:40,020
Maybe one day

1155
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:42,020
you can join my group

1156
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:44,020
to save your mother's

1157
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:46,020
career

1158
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:47,020
What do you think?

1159
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:48,020
Thank you, Director He

1160
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:50,020
for your love and apology

1161
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:52,020
I am sorry

1162
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:54,020
You can't affect my life

1163
01:06:58,020 --> 01:06:59,020
I am going to find

1164
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:02,020
someone who really has an influence on my life

1165
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:06,020
I don't want you to be my sister

1166
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:09,020
What's wrong with you?

1167
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:16,020
What's wrong with you?

1168
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:35,020
I don't want to be your sister

1169
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:04,020
I am sorry

1170
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:35,020
I filmed the screen

1171
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:37,020
like I always do

1172
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:39,020
happily

1173
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:41,020
when I go to every house

1174
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:43,020
having food

1175
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:45,020
They are the first ingredient

1176
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:58,020
It is always

1177
01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:00,020
aatching

1178
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:01,800
No..

1179
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:03,760
It seems like something strange

1180
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:32,020
I'm not here.

1181
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:38,020
Why am I still here?

1182
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:43,020
You fainted in my office.

1183
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:55,020
How long will you eat the painkiller? Why didn't you let me know?

1184
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:58,020
When did you start to care about me?

1185
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:00,020
I'm a headache.

1186
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:03,020
After the painkiller, I'm more affected.

1187
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:04,020
It's not a pain in the ass.

1188
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:07,020
Do you know that there's a tumor in your head?

1189
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:20,020
Wang Xin, I'll make you live.

1190
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:22,020
Can't you stop being annoying?

1191
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:24,020
I really want to kill you.

1192
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:26,020
The end of this!

1193
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:30,020
The painkiller is over.

1194
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:32,020
I don't have feelings for you anymore.

1195
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:34,020
We're just friends.

1196
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:36,020
Do you know that if he's not with you,

1197
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:39,020
that Yuan Nian will go home to be alone again?

1198
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:43,020
If he's with me, he won't be sad and hide from you.

1199
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:47,020
I'm just like my family.

1200
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:50,020
You'll come to save me.

1201
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:53,020
You're dying.

1202
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:56,020
I've been taking care of you for a month.

1203
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:59,020
Don't waste your time.

1204
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:01,020
I'm hurt like this.

1205
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:03,020
I'm not married yet. I already like you.

1206
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:10,020
You're really special.

1207
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:12,020
Don't think about it.

1208
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:13,020
Be brave.

1209
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:15,020
Why should I be afraid?

1210
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:18,020
I'm afraid that if you're brave, it's him.

1211
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:22,020
I'll accept all the treatment.

1212
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:23,020
I'll take it again.

1213
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:25,020
When can I get the treatment?

1214
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:29,020
The only treatment is the latest treatment in the world.

1215
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:31,020
I don't want to be taken by He Dong.

1216
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,020
He Dong's goal is to be with you.

1217
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:35,020
But you know better than anyone else.

1218
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:37,020
I only like Mu Zhen.

1219
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:39,020
Dad, I finally found my own way.

1220
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:41,020
I finally found my own happiness.

1221
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:43,020
You must keep your eyes on me.

1222
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:46,020
Give me the greatest courage and strength.

1223
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:49,020
Let me accompany him through this suffering.

1224
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:11,020
I'm sorry.

1225
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:13,020
I'm sorry.

1226
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:15,020
I'm sorry.

1227
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:17,020
I'm sorry.

1228
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:19,020
I'm sorry.

1229
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:21,020
I'm sorry.

1230
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:23,020
I'm sorry.

1231
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:25,020
I'm sorry.

1232
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:27,020
I'm sorry.

1233
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:29,020
I'm sorry.

1234
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:31,020
I'm sorry.

1235
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:33,020
I'm sorry.

1236
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:35,020
I'm sorry.

1237
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:37,020
I'm sorry.

1238
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:39,020
I'm sorry.

1239
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:41,020
I'm sorry.

1240
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:43,020
I'm sorry.

1241
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:45,020
I'm sorry.

1242
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:47,020
I'm sorry.

1243
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:49,020
I'm sorry.

1244
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:51,020
I'm sorry.

1245
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:53,020
I'm sorry.

1246
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:55,020
I'm sorry.

1247
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:57,020
I'm sorry.

1248
01:12:57,020 --> 01:12:59,020
I'm sorry.

1249
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:01,020
I'm sorry.

1250
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:03,020
I'm sorry.

1251
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:05,020
I'm sorry.

1252
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:07,020
I'm sorry.

1253
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:09,020
I'm sorry.

1254
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:11,020
I'm sorry.

1255
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:13,020
I'm sorry.

1256
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:15,020
I'm sorry.

1257
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:17,020
I'm sorry.

1258
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:19,020
I'm sorry.

1259
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:21,020
I'm sorry.

1260
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:23,020
I'm sorry.

1261
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:25,020
I'm sorry.

1262
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:27,020
I'm sorry.

1263
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:29,020
I'm sorry.

1264
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:31,020
I'm sorry.

1265
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:33,020
I'm sorry.
