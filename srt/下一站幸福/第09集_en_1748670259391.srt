1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Next, we will broadcast for you the next happy moment

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Lawyer and Dad, Yang Kai-bo

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
He went to the police station from the police station

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Because I hit that bastard

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
He wanted to set up a law service for me for 240 hours

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Before hitting someone, there were some strange scenes in his mind

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
He felt very painful

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Does this mean he has some kind of memory

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
He thought about it slowly

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
A girl with a high IQ and a strong spirit

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You are the one who can't afford to lose money

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You are the one who is going to be called the Jiu-feng case

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It should be me and Hua Teng-jie's Jiu-feng

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Don't help them

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Don't worry, Uncle

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I don't want to waste time on you

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I have been to the village of Tainan

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's been a long time

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I am so happy to see Dad

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
He came to the earth with his voice

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Dad

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Xiao Le, I have told you

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
He is the lawyer uncle of Taipei

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's not you, right?

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's you

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Congratulations

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Dad really came to see me

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
He will take me to the police station in the future, right?

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I am so scared

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
He knew Xiao Le and his relationship

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
He didn't know what would happen

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I heard from my mom

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This person is not your dad

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I have been waiting for you

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I am still in love with you

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I love him, he is crazy

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
My dream is so cruel

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But I will never let you go

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
No matter if he is sick or healthy

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
If he is poor or rich

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
If he is good or bad

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You are willing to love him and comfort him

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You are willing to be loyal to him

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I am willing to

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I am willing to

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
No matter if I met him for the first time

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I will fall into his eyes

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I have a final goal

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The goal is to make the moment become a magic

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
If I can only choose the second chance

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I hope it will be this moment

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I know I promised you

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I will promise this scene

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But if I don't follow the promise

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Please promise me to give this person the light

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And everything is a dream

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
A long dream

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The dream is awake

59
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You should forget it

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You just have to think of me

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
That's enough

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I will protect you in another world

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You are right

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
We have nothing to do with each other

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's been a long time since I met you

66
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
He doesn't belong to this place

67
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The first heaven

68
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The final flower garden

69
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The first flower garden

70
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The first flower garden

71
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The first flower garden

72
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The first flower garden

73
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Miao Mo Chen

74
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The first flower garden

75
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The first flower garden

76
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's really you

77
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That person is going to be around you again

78
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What are you talking about?

79
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That talent

80
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You look very tall in the afternoon

81
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You are even taller than Tuobao

82
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What's your name?

83
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Mo Mo

84
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I was about to order the drinks

85
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And he is still around you

86
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So you were the one who helped me

87
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So you saw me yesterday

88
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yes

89
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But this is the first time we meet

90
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Hello, I am Ren Guangxi, a lawyer from Di Jian Shu

91
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I have to stay here for a while

92
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Sorry, I was drunk yesterday

93
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
How can you say that we are the first time to meet?

94
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Do you know me?

95
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Sorry, I often get married

96
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's because the surgery is very serious

97
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Surgery?

98
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
If you really know me

99
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You should know that I had a big brain surgery six years ago

100
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
All my memories are gone

101
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You should say that

102
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I had a big brain surgery six years ago

103
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
If I really know you

104
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I will remember you

105
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Who told you to come here?

106
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I said I would sign it

107
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It means I will protect you

108
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
But it's not a big deal

109
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
If we find someone to introduce

110
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You can take me to the office

111
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I can stay in your place

112
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I will take you to the office

113
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I will leave you alone and call Ren Guangxi

114
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I will appear because I believe

115
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
There is no time to be too late

116
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I can stay with him

117
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Otherwise, no one will hurt him

118
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I will accept all the treatment

119
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I only found the reason I went down

120
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I only hope that this will be a good result

121
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I will let you say that

122
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I am a big brain surgeon

123
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Only six years can come

124
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Only six years

125
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Only six years

126
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Thank you

127
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You don't look like crazy

128
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm telling you

129
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,440
What should you do?

130
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,520
I don't know

131
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,520
Mr. Lawyer, I have a lot of things to do

132
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,520
You can change everything on the table

133
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,040
I want to buy some snacks here

134
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,040
Thank you

135
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,520
Don't cry, Mr. Lawyer

136
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,520
Isn't it better to do this now?

137
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,520
The operation has made him forget everything

138
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,520
This means that I'm just a stranger to him

139
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,520
Since I'm a stranger, I have nothing to worry about

140
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,520
This girl is really weird

141
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,520
I don't want to be in her house and never have to promise to be a village head

142
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,520
I don't want to be a bad girl

143
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,520
What should I do? I really don't have a father

144
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,520
I'm not a bad girl

145
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,520
I'm going to call you again

146
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,520
I'm a stranger to him

147
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,520
Xiao Le

148
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,520
I've told you yesterday that he's not your father or stranger

149
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,520
He's just a lawyer. You can't trust him

150
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,520
I'm sorry, I'm not your father. You can call me Uncle Guangxi

151
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,520
Why are your eyes so red?

152
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,520
I just saw a blind man with his eyes

153
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,520
But it's fine now. Xiao Le is great

154
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,520
Put the bento in the bag. I'll prepare a glass of water

155
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,520
Mr. Lawyer, can you finish your breakfast?

156
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,520
Mr. Lawyer is weird. You can call me Guangxi

157
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,520
We'll stay together after the operation

158
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,520
You don't want me to call you Miss Fang Tong, do you?

159
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,520
I'm not your father

160
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,520
I'm just a lawyer and a lawyer

161
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,520
You'll call me that

162
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,520
Why is such a strange girl born into such a cute child?

163
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,520
I'm the one who likes to eat beef rice

164
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,520
Yes, you're inviting me to eat it

165
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,520
Aren't we going to eat it together?

166
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,520
Xiao Le is going to finish it. You can eat it when you're drunk

167
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,520
Xiao Le, hurry up and get the glass of water

168
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,520
You want to drink it?

169
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,520
I'll get it

170
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,520
This guy's taste is quite similar to mine

171
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:10,520
Lu Cheng, I made my favorite beef rice

172
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,520
I want to give it to you

173
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,520
This is the gift from Xiao Le

174
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,520
Thank you

175
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,520
Lu Cheng, you're not feeling well, right?

176
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,520
Xiao Le, I'm telling you

177
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,520
That uncle is not going to live with us

178
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,520
Why?

179
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,520
I can't explain it to you

180
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,520
But Lu Cheng will find a place to live for him

181
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,520
But Xiao Le is going to be a good boy

182
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,520
Okay, I really like Uncle Guangxi

183
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,520
I don't want to make him unhappy

184
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,520
Huh, so nice, right?

185
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,520
Think of it like this

186
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,520
I'm young if I see it

187
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
I feel so happy

188
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,520
It's quiet now

189
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,520
Welcome, welcome, welcome

190
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,520
Welcome to the garden

191
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
I'm so happy to see you

192
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,520
How are you?

193
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,520
I'm fine

194
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,520
May I ask you to come to...

195
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,520
We're looking for...

196
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,520
I'm here to find you

197
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,520
The gardener

198
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,520
The gardener

199
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,520
Don't look at me

200
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,520
You see, this is love

201
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,520
You're here to find out the real reason

202
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,520
This is a very old and beautiful garden

203
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,520
So this old garden is where you can rest

204
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,520
So you must be very careful

205
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,520
Otherwise, we'll call a secretary

206
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,520
And you'll be in trouble

207
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,520
You see, this is the news

208
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,520
People are so busy

209
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,520
They're so busy

210
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,520
They can't take care of themselves

211
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,520
Right

212
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,520
Let me go

213
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,520
Let me go

214
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,520
I don't need to come here

215
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,520
This is not a big deal

216
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,520
You should know that people should take care of you

217
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,520
We're not going to let you go

218
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,520
Okay, you're my assistant

219
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,520
You need to be the most basic student

220
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,520
Please leave the garden

221
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,520
I'm leaving

222
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,520
I'm leaving

223
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,520
I'm leaving

224
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,520
I'm leaving

225
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,520
You're leaving?

226
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,520
Let's go

227
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,520
I'm leaving

228
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,520
I want to ask you something

229
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,520
Do you have anyone at home who can help you?

230
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,520
After all, it's not convenient for me and Xiao De to be together

231
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,520
You're so busy

232
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,520
You're not even a part of the family

233
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,520
You're so busy

234
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,520
You're so busy

235
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,520
You know, this is the history of our country

236
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,520
The history of our country

237
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,520
You're also a part of the country

238
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,520
So everyone here is looking at you

239
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,520
Looking at you and the situation

240
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,520
You're always so busy

241
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,520
You're always looking at us

242
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,520
I'm always looking at you

243
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,520
I want to be your assistant

244
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,520
You're always looking at me

245
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,520
Don't be so short

246
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,520
So don't tell me about this

247
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,520
The last question

248
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,520
Who will use the computer?

249
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,520
I won't

250
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
It's up to you

251
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,520
Will you use Word or Excel or PowerPoint?

252
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,520
What's the question?

253
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,520
I don't know what to say

254
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,520
I'm not good at Facebook

255
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,520
I'm not good at it

256
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,520
I'm not good at it

257
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,520
I'm not good at it

258
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,520
Go

259
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,520
I'm telling you

260
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,520
I'm not good at it

261
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,520
I'm not good at it

262
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,520
He's lying

263
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
Go

264
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,520
I'm not good at it

265
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,520
You're so short

266
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,520
You're always looking at me

267
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,520
I can understand a little bit of English

268
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,520
At least I can understand the computer

269
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,520
There's no one who can understand the computer

270
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,520
It's up to you

271
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,520
What's the problem?

272
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,520
You're always looking at me

273
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,520
He's a good assistant

274
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,520
It's up to you

275
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,520
Is my assistant so hard?

276
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,520
You hate me so much

277
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,520
At least give me a reason

278
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,520
I'm getting more and more

279
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,520
I'm getting more and more

280
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,520
Come on

281
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,520
I'm telling you

282
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,520
I'm not good at it

283
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,520
I'm not good at it

284
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,520
And

285
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,520
Xiao Le

286
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,520
He's taking care of him every day

287
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,520
I'm telling you

288
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,520
You're so short

289
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,520
I'll take you to the hospital

290
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,520
Everyone is taking care of you

291
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,520
You're so short

292
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,520
And

293
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,520
I...

294
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,520
No, there's more

295
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,520
You can change it

296
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,520
It's not your turn now

297
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,520
It's your turn now

298
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,520
We can turn it around and ask

299
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,520
Do you know?

300
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,520
Do you know?

301
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,520
Yes, I do

302
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,520
You're good

303
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,520
You're good

304
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,520
You're good

305
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,520
I'll give you a chance

306
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,520
Okay

307
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,520
Everyone needs me so much

308
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,520
You should take the job of a secretary

309
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,520
Listen to me

310
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,520
Otherwise, I'll be disappointed in you

311
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,520
Yes, boss

312
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,520
Good

313
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,520
When can you start working?

314
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,520
I have to take Xiao Le to class first

315
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,520
Let's go together

316
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,520
Taking care of staff is also what the boss should do

317
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,520
We can go to work after work

318
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,520
Good night

319
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,520
I saw you fight for him this morning

320
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,520
What's wrong with him?

321
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,520
He's the first-class drug addict

322
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,520
What about his father?

323
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
It's none of your business

324
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,520
I'm going to be late

325
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,520
Run fast

326
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,520
Then run fast

327
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,520
Otherwise, you'll get hurt

328
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,520
Xiao Le, let's go

329
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,520
Wait

330
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,520
Faster

331
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,520
Xiao Le, be careful

332
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,520
Xiao Le

333
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,520
Did you find a place to fight?

334
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,520
I'm in a pain every time

335
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,520
I often fight in the hospital

336
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,520
Really?

337
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,520
Then you want to fight with a water crystal

338
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,520
Yes, I want to fight with a water crystal

339
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,520
But my type is different from yours

340
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,520
And when I fought with a real person

341
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,520
I couldn't talk

342
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,520
So Xiao Le, you're the most brave man I've ever seen

343
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,520
You want to fight with a water crystal

344
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,520
You're my first-class drug addict

345
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,520
Take Xiao Le

346
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,520
What's the third-class drug addict?

347
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,520
I want to be myself

348
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,520
I can't bother you

349
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,520
Forget about the books

350
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,520
Thank you for helping me

351
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,520
He's not bothering me

352
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,520
I treat him like a child

353
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,520
Why so serious?

354
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,520
Don't treat him like that

355
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,520
Your consciousness and sympathy will only make him more painful

356
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,520
You'll never be his father

357
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,520
Don't treat him well

358
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,520
Don't bother him anymore

359
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,520
Your consciousness and sympathy

360
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,520
Will only make him more painful

361
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,520
Because you'll never be his family

362
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,520
In short, don't interfere with my family's life

363
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,520
Xiao Le, let's go

364
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,520
Xiao Le, you're so cute

365
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,520
Come on

366
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,520
What's that?

367
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,520
I think the father and the son-in-law are good

368
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,520
You can consider it

369
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,520
Xiao Le, Xiao Le

370
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,520
Hello, Xiao Le

371
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,520
It's our family day after two days

372
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,520
We'll invite Jiazhan and Xiao-Ping to perform together

373
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,520
We'll complete the task together

374
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,520
Please prepare the show for Xiao Le and Xiao Le

375
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,520
Why are you here?

376
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,520
What are you doing here?

377
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,520
Why are you here?

378
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,520
I'm talking about you

379
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,520
Me?

380
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,520
I heard you found Mu Chen Dang's secret recipe this morning.

381
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,520
Did you do it on purpose?

382
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,520
Of course I did.

383
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,520
You didn't even turn on the computer when you were choosing?

384
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,520
You're even worse than me.

385
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,520
I'm not going to let you know you did it on purpose.

386
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,520
What do you want to do to Mu Chen?

387
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,520
Listen carefully. I'm the one who's going to make it.

388
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,520
You're crazy!

389
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,520
I just met him.

390
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,520
You've known him for so long. You're worried about him, right?

391
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,520
What are you thinking about?

392
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,520
Why are you still here when Dong Xin is married?

393
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,520
Why aren't you familiar with him?

394
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,520
Tu Yan!

395
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,520
He really doesn't remember you.

396
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,520
What's going on?

397
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,520
So you mean...

398
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,520
After he opened the door to the public,

399
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,520
he forgot everything he had in the past.

400
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,520
Including you.

401
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,520
This is the first time I've seen you like this.

402
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,520
It's not the right thing to do.

403
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,520
He forgets everything.

404
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,520
After he goes 204 hours in the past,

405
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,520
he forgets everything.

406
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,520
He doesn't feel anything.

407
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,520
Are you done?

408
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,520
Before work,

409
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,520
who can explain our relationship?

410
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,520
Nothing.

411
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,520
We've known each other since we were in college.

412
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,520
We're not that close.

413
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,520
You told me about the horse.

414
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,520
So I'm not very close to you.

415
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,520
I'm very suspicious now.

416
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,520
What's the ability of a guy who used to be a teacher at school

417
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,520
to help us win this relationship in Huatian Village?

418
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,520
I heard you say that.

419
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,520
You should have been very dissatisfied with me.

420
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,520
But I hope you understand the situation now.

421
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,520
No matter what happened in the past,

422
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,520
I'm in the law firm now.

423
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,520
It's a secret.

424
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,520
I don't need to understand.

425
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:15,520
You're still the one who's recognized and treated me as a good person.

426
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,520
We asked you to do your job well.

427
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,520
But you came to send your secretary to school.

428
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,520
Don't be angry.

429
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,520
Relax.

430
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,520
Come to Huatian Village,

431
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,520
you can enjoy the scenery.

432
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,520
And I'll find the way to save Huatian Village.

433
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,520
I'll trouble you to go back to your capital city.

434
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,520
I'll think of your suitable way.

435
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,520
And don't forget what I said.

436
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,520
You used to leave me a note.

437
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,520
It's easier than he did.

438
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,520
Mu Chen,

439
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,520
if you have any problems,

440
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,520
remember to call me.

441
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,520
But he's my secretary now.

442
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,520
So he has to go to work with me.

443
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,520
Go to work.

444
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,520
My ex-lover secretary.

445
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,520
I guess that in the spring,

446
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,520
there are already two men who are kind to you.

447
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,520
That's great.

448
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,520
Let's go.

449
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,520
Look,

450
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,520
my ex-lover father is so much like me.

451
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,520
What ex-lover father?

452
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,520
I didn't see it.

453
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,520
They are coming.

454
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,520
They are leaving.

455
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,520
If there is a ex-lover father,

456
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,520
I'll ask him to come with you to the house to watch the magic.

457
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,520
Then what's the problem?

458
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,520
What if he comes?

459
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,520
I'll give you my secretary.

460
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,520
But if you

461
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,520
don't come to the ex-lover father,

462
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,520
you have to give me the candy.

463
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,520
Tang Tang, don't be afraid.

464
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,520
My ex-lover father is coming.

465
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,520
Okay.

466
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,520
Let's go.

467
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,520
Little Red Bull, be quiet.

468
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,520
You're all ready.

469
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,520
Get ready to eat.

470
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,520
This is the red bull.

471
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,520
This is Little Red Bull.

472
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,520
This is Tang Tang.

473
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,520
I want to eat the red bull.

474
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,520
And there is no red bull.

475
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,520
I want to eat the red bull.

476
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,520
Little Red Bull,

477
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,520
please eat the red bull.

478
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,520
Who is it?

479
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,520
It's Tang Tang.

480
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,520
Tang Tang.

481
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,520
Tang Tang.

482
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,520
Tang Tang.

483
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,520
Tang Tang.

484
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,520
Tang Tang.

485
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,520
Tang Tang.

486
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,520
Tang Tang.

487
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,520
Tang Tang.

488
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,520
Tang Tang.

489
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,520
What did you say?

490
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,520
What did you say?

491
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,520
What's this?

492
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,520
I'll give it to you.

493
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,520
Today,

494
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,520
we're going to eat red bull,

495
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,520
and then we'll make a drink.

496
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,520
We don't know how to choose.

497
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,520
Let's take it.

498
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,520
We're going to...

499
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,520
We're going to ask him.

500
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,520
We're going to ask him.

501
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,520
We want to eat red bull.

502
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,520
Give it to you.

503
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,520
We're going to...

504
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,520
And then...

505
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,520
Give it to him.

506
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,520
They'll have to take it to you.

507
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,520
I'm going to take it.

508
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,520
Okay.

509
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,520
Okay.

510
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,520
Okay.

511
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,520
He's going to drink it.

512
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,520
Yes, he's right.

513
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,520
I want to tell you that

514
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,520
this is a real reality.

515
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,520
Really?

516
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,520
Yes, it's a real reality.

517
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,520
I really want to tell you that

518
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,520
I am a man.

519
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,520
I want to be a hero.

520
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,520
I want to be a hero.

521
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,520
I want to be a hero.

522
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,520
I want to be a hero.

523
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,520
I want to be a hero.

524
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,520
I want to be a hero.

525
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,520
I don't know much.

526
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,520
I don't know much.

527
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,520
I really want to be a hero.

528
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,520
So I want to tell you that

529
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,520
this is a real reality.

530
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,520
I want to tell you that

531
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,520
this is a real reality.

532
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,520
I want to tell you that

533
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,520
this is a real reality.

534
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,520
I want to be a hero.

535
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:50,520
The following days

536
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,520
I'm so embarrassed.

537
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,520
I want to be a hero.

538
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,520
I want to be a hero.

539
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:00,520
Of course, I will help you.

540
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,520
I will study like this

541
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,520
when I go home.

542
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,520
OK.

543
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,520
OK.

544
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,520
Can we start now?

545
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,520
No.

546
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,520
Let's start.

547
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,520
Let's start.

548
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,520
You are a doctor.

549
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,520
I will tell you.

550
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,520
I am so embarrassed.

551
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,520
You know, we are going to go to the country.

552
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,520
We will not say that we are going to the country.

553
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,520
I am so embarrassed.

554
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,520
I don't know what to say.

555
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,520
I don't know what to say.

556
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,520
OK.

557
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,520
You can have this 240 hours.

558
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,520
It's sweet.

559
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,520
After you have it,

560
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,520
I will go to help you.

561
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,520
No.

562
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,520
OK.

563
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,520
You are so embarrassed.

564
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,520
You are so embarrassed.

565
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,520
I will tell you.

566
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,520
You are so embarrassed.

567
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,520
I have a big problem.

568
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,520
I want to ask you.

569
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,520
Because I was so embarrassed

570
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,520
that I told her husband.

571
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,520
Did he tell you that he has it?

572
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,520
No.

573
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,520
I usually wear it like this.

574
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,520
I am so embarrassed.

575
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,520
I will tell you.

576
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,520
OK.

577
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,520
I will help you.

578
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,520
I will help you study like this.

579
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,520
You can have this first.

580
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,520
Wait a minute.

581
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,520
I will tell you.

582
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,520
Thank you.

583
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,520
You are so embarrassed.

584
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,520
I want to have a big one.

585
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,520
I want to have a big one.

586
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,520
I will make it.

587
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,520
OK.

588
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,520
Write the situation in this board.

589
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,520
Write it clearly.

590
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,520
I will help you.

591
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,520
I will help you.

592
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,520
Xiao Wei Zou.

593
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,520
Sorry.

594
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,520
I will help you.

595
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,520
I will help you.

596
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,520
Thank you.

597
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,520
I will tell you.

598
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,520
Thank you.

599
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,520
I will write here.

600
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,520
I will write here.

601
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,520
I will write it clearly.

602
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,520
Thank you.

603
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,520
You can have it.

604
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,520
Miss.

605
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,520
You are so sweet.

606
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,520
I will tell you.

607
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,520
You are so sweet.

608
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,520
You are so sweet.

609
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,520
I will help you.

610
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,520
OK?

611
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,520
I will tell you.

612
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,520
We really don't know each other?

613
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,520
We don't know each other.

614
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,520
We don't know each other.

615
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,520
I think we have met before.

616
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,520
I will think about it.

617
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:40,520
Happy moments

618
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,520
Don't we know each other?

619
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,520
We don't.

620
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,520
But I think you are very familiar with the noodles.

621
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,520
Where have you seen them before?

622
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,520
I'm sorry.

623
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,520
You are eating this too?

624
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,520
Why are you all so old?

625
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,520
Miss, have we seen noodles before?

626
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,520
Where have we met before?

627
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,520
Have we been to the same university?

628
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,520
Hello.

629
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,520
I'm talking to you.

630
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,520
You are taking Xiao Le alone.

631
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,520
Why don't you get married with your boyfriend?

632
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,520
Miss Ren, don't be so boring.

633
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,520
I'm just bored to talk to you.

634
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,520
I don't know who you are looking for.

635
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,520
I can help you to ask the villagers to talk to you.

636
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,520
And I'm going to ask you for a small house.

637
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,520
I'm going to help Xiao Le to get the needle.

638
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,520
I'll be back when I'm done.

639
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,520
I think you don't like your busy boyfriend.

640
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,520
Are you waiting for Xiao Le's father to come back?

641
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,520
Alright.

642
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,520
I'll buy you 10 words.

643
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,520
You answer me one question.

644
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,520
I'm so confused.

645
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,520
Am I crazy?

646
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,520
I didn't spend so much money on one question.

647
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,520
Then don't ask.

648
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,520
This is none of your business.

649
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,520
Xiao Le is asleep.

650
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,520
He's avoiding the money.

651
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,520
At that time, he was sick.

652
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,520
He had a knife.

653
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,520
He was anxious.

654
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,520
Yes, he was more concerned about me.

655
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,520
That's why I don't understand.

656
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,520
You treat everyone so well.

657
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,520
You treat me so coldly.

658
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,520
Let me go.

659
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,520
Children are set free and silent lesser than MTZ Anything.

660
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,920
Hey, man.

661
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,520
Has Xiao Le perhaps come here for a reason?

662
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,520
I don't know A' large a woman's Battery Experi outside.

663
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,520
He messing up while discussing girls.

664
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,520
But then he also Hulk lessons me a trick.

665
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,520
He just doesn't get bored without trying.

666
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,520
If you know me,

667
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,520
you can have a normal battery,

668
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,520
then I'll just beat you.

669
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,520
If you want safety,

670
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,520
We met at the airport in the airport

671
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,520
I was still playing the game of the game of the game

672
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,520
Later, he knew I was sick

673
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,520
But he still wanted to stay with me

674
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,520
Even if I have a bad memory, he still wanted to be with me

675
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,520
The person I just mentioned is my fiancée

676
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,520
He was the only person I could be with me when I woke up

677
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,520
He's the most important person to me

678
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,520
So...you're getting married?

679
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,520
We just got married

680
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,520
We'll get married when I leave this place

681
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,520
What's wrong?

682
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,520
I'm fine

683
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,520
I want to talk to you

684
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,520
I'm fine with you

685
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,520
I really want to be your friend

686
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,520
Why didn't you divorce me?

687
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,520
Because my personality is like this

688
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,520
I'm leaving

689
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,520
I'm leaving

690
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,520
I'm looking for a couple of my siblings

691
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,520
What kind of woman are you?

692
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,520
I'm leaving

693
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,520
I'm leaving

694
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,520
This is not a law firm, right?

695
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,520
I'm not leaving. Let's change the taste

696
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,520
Lawyer, I've already put your heart and food in the warehouse

697
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,520
That's where you'll live

698
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,520
There's a room inside the warehouse

699
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,520
I slept in the room yesterday

700
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,520
We have a mother

701
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,520
You don't have to be so strict with a man

702
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,520
I just want you to stay here

703
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,520
He didn't agree to let you stay

704
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,520
If you're not happy, you can go to the village

705
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,520
Yang Wucheng

706
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,520
Have you seen the man?

707
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,520
He's my friend

708
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,520
He's my friend

709
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,520
Why are you so bad?

710
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,520
Sorry, my name is Li Wucheng

711
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,520
We'll go get dinner

712
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,520
Liang Xiaole

713
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,520
You have to wait

714
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,520
I've promised dinner to you

715
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,520
Thank you

716
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,520
I'm going to eat

717
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,520
Have a good meal

718
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,520
Thank you

719
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,520
It's delicious

720
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,520
How about my dinner?

721
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,520
Xiaole

722
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,520
Your mother has a boyfriend

723
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,520
He seems to be very close to him

724
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,520
What did you say?

725
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,520
He's my brother-in-law

726
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,520
Xiaole

727
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,520
Do you think my brother-in-law has anything to do with me?

728
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,520
Why do you call him brother-in-law?

729
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,520
Because we're brothers

730
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,520
I'm very complicated with my brother-in-law

731
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,520
I'm the first one to take care of me

732
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,520
He's the one who took care of me

733
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,520
Hello

734
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,520
Wuxia

735
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,520
How is the situation in Hua Lianchun?

736
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,520
I know the situation here

737
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,520
But I'm very sure of the villagers' attitude

738
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,520
Wuxia

739
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:14,520
Don't forget that you broke up with your previous wedding

740
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,520
You should think of a way

741
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:20,520
To make that innocent villagers get the money

742
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,520
You know?

743
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,520
I know

744
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,520
Look, uncle

745
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,520
He Weitian is here

746
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,520
He's going to the building

747
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,520
I can't rent it to him

748
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,520
It's not like I'm going to rent it to him

749
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,520
I'm going to take care of it

750
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,520
I'm sorry

751
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,520
I'm sorry

752
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,520
We're friends

753
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,520
I'm sorry

754
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,520
I'm sorry

755
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,520
I'm sorry

756
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,520
I'm sorry

757
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,520
I'm sorry

758
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,520
I'm sorry

759
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,520
I'm sorry

760
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,520
I'm sorry

761
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,520
I'm sorry

762
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,520
ata

763
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,520
Where's the cash from?

764
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,520
Wuxia

765
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,520
Don't forget

766
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,520
that you broke up with your previous wedding

767
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,520
You should think about a way

768
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,520
To make that innocent villagers

769
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,520
get the money

770
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,520
It'll be over soon

771
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,520
.

772
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:43,180
Xiao Le, wait a minute.

773
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:23,520
lai

774
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,520
I can help you fix it

775
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,520
Okay

776
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,520
Liang Xiaole, what is the 13th order of the two families?

777
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:38,520
Yes, we have to deal with it

778
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:41,520
We can't trouble the family

779
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,520
Lawyer, we can deal with this matter ourselves

780
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,520
Don't bother you, you can go back to sleep

781
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,520
I'm just curious

782
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,520
Xiaole, let's go back to sleep

783
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,520
This is Liang Xiaole's exclusive electric fan

784
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,520
It's so cool and windy

785
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,520
Aren't you hungry?

786
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:25,520
You forgot that you didn't eat when you were in the belly of the tree

787
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,520
I'm not hungry

788
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:31,520
No, because there's a boat passing through here

789
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,520
It's always passing through here

790
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,520
So Xiaole is not hungry when she's full

791
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:39,520
If Xiaole feels cold, she will feel cold

792
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,520
Really? Where is the fan?

793
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,520
She can't see it now

794
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:50,520
But if Xiaole thinks about something, she will know it by her eyes

795
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:55,520
What am I thinking now?

796
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,520
You are thinking about...

797
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:02,520
You are thinking about the story that you just finished

798
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,520
You guessed it

799
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,520
You don't need to tell the same story

800
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,520
You can play the princess

801
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:12,520
Xiaole thinks that she is like a princess

802
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:16,520
She is beautiful, white-skinned, and a princess

803
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:21,520
She is like a princess

804
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,520
You are like a princess

805
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:30,520
You are like a princess

806
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,520
I'm not a princess, I'm a princess

807
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:00,520
I'm not a princess, I'm a princess

808
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,520
Are you okay?

809
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,520
Yes

810
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,520
I'm fine

811
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,520
I'm telling you something

812
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,520
What's the matter?

813
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:41,520
You are not a princess, you are like a princess

814
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,520
You don't have to tell the same story

815
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,520
You are like a princess

816
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,520
You are like a princess

817
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,520
You are like a princess

818
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,520
You are so funny

819
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,520
You are so funny

820
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,520
Who is kidding you?

821
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:13,520
After I learned about it, I got the process of flowering fields

822
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,520
It's not like that

823
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,520
According to the law, they can sue you for being too kind

824
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,520
and force you to leave

825
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,520
You are so annoying

826
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:28,520
It seems that the official hasn't been able to fight

827
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,520
So he has already been released

828
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,520
He has been released?

829
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,520
He has been released?

830
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,520
You are not telling the same story

831
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,520
But don't be disappointed

832
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,520
After all, such a big company is very important

833
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,520
Yesterday, I called several companies

834
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,520
and talked to the law firm about the company

835
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,520
and they were willing to sell me a face

836
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,520
They offered me $500,000

837
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,520
I hope that everyone can move out within 15 days

838
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,520
I think this is a very good condition

839
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,520
I hope that everyone can accept it

840
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,520
What if we do?

841
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,520
No

842
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,520
Who is it now?

843
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,520
You think we haven't read the book in the countryside?

844
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,520
$500,000?

845
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,520
I don't have to pay $500,000 for a season of flowers

846
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,520
You are not a good lawyer

847
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,520
You are so stupid

848
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,520
You are so stupid

849
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,520
You are so stupid

850
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,520
You are a good lawyer

851
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,520
You are so stupid

852
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,520
You are now a lawyer

853
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,520
You are a good lawyer

854
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,520
You are a good lawyer

855
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,520
I am the 45th sister Wei Jun

856
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:39,520
What?

857
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,620
I am the 45th identity

858
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,520
I am the single issue

859
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,520
Since they are so good

860
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,520
I advise everyone don't hesitate

861
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,000
Otherwise, if you

862
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,520
lose patient or fight out at will

863
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,520
You won't earn neither a penny

864
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,520
maybe

865
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,880
Instead, we need to Hadi Thug

866
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,520
find a reason to spend money

867
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,520
Then, I will...

868
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,520
We can learn how to observe the beauty of the village

869
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,520
and fight against the smell

870
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,520
I tell you, as long as we unite

871
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,520
Xiaomi can also fight against the smell of the gold

872
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,520
That's right, we can fight against the smell of the gold

873
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,520
We can fight against the smell of the gold

874
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,520
Do you have any precious things in there?

875
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,520
Red star-shaped flowers?

876
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,520
Or black cotton leather?

877
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,520
It will just fly to the flower fields

878
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,520
It's so beautiful

879
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,520
It's so beautiful

880
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,520
How about this?

881
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,520
That's right

882
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,520
How do you know this?

883
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,520
Do you believe that Xiaomi can fight against the smell of the gold

884
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,520
and talk to you?

885
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,520
Can you finally get a life of a loser?

886
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,520
You are so stupid

887
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,520
I'm so stupid

888
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,520
I don't know how to explain

889
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,520
I don't know how to explain

890
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,520
I don't know how to explain

891
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,520
You are so stupid

892
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,520
You are so stupid

893
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,520
I don't know how to explain

894
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,520
I don't know how to explain

895
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,520
I don't know how to explain

896
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,520
I don't know how to explain

897
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,520
I don't know how to explain

898
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:12,520
I don't know how to explain

899
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:15,520
I don't know how to explain

900
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,520
I can't understand

901
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,520
Nobody can ask us about this

902
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,520
Somebody to ask us about this

903
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,520
Nobody knows

904
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,520
Who?

905
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,520
Sunchang, don't be so excited

906
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,520
I didn't expect that you would be so kind

907
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,520
Lawyer, you were sent to Huatian Village

908
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,520
You should be standing with us

909
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,520
But not now

910
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,520
Let's give up on the phone

911
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,520
If you can't help us get back to the land

912
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,520
Please leave Huatian Village

913
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,520
There's no need

914
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:55,520
Uncle Yang, I don't want to make you the third point

915
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,520
First, Lawyer is not a god

916
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:00,520
I can only give you the information you provided

917
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:03,520
It's a suggestion to you professionally

918
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,520
According to my professional judgment

919
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:09,520
Li Tou, there's no evidence of violence

920
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,520
You can't win

921
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:15,520
Second, you're my secretary

922
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,520
Please do your job well

923
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,520
Don't break the meeting

924
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:23,520
Third, everyone is very welcome except you

925
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,520
I'm also a member of Huatian Village

926
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,520
I have the right to speak

927
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:31,520
If you have any conflicts with your secretary

928
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,520
Please ask for your signature

929
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,520
Even if there's not enough evidence, you can prove it

930
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,520
This is the meaning of law

931
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:42,520
Even if there's not enough evidence, you can prove it

932
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,520
This is the meaning of law

933
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,520
It's not like you said it

934
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,520
Where did you learn it from?

935
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,520
I learnt it by myself

936
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,520
You can't use me to prove it

937
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,520
You will be punished

938
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,520
I don't know

939
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,520
I don't know

940
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,520
You don't know

941
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,520
You can't use me to prove it

942
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,520
I don't know

943
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,520
I don't know

944
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,520
I don't know

945
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,520
I don't know

946
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,520
I don't know

947
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,520
I don't know

948
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,520
I'm not like you

949
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,520
Where did you learn from?

950
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,520
The person who taught me this

951
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,520
Is a politician and brave

952
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,520
If you don't have enough evidence

953
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,520
You can't find the evidence

954
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,520
Isn't this what you should do?

955
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,520
Unlike you

956
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,520
You're a liar and a hypocrite

957
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,520
I really don't know why you're a lawyer

958
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,520
I'm welcome

959
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,520
I'm not a lawyer

960
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,520
I'm welcome

961
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:51,520
If I'm welcome

962
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,520
I won't waste time here

963
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,520
I'll persuade you to be more careful

964
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,520
Do you know that my back is 100,000 dollars every hour?

965
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,520
Then please go back to the place where it's 100,000

966
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:01,520
We're not asking you to be so considerate

967
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,520
It's not good

968
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,520
I'm going to the hospital

969
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,520
I'm going to the hospital

970
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,520
I'm going to the hospital

971
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,520
I'm going to the hospital

972
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:21,520
I'm going to the hospital

973
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,520
I'm not a lawyer

974
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,520
Why are you still here?

975
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,520
Go and save her

976
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,520
What's the matter?

977
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,520
I'm not going back to the hospital

978
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,520
I'm going to ask the police to send you the money

979
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,520
The money

980
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,520
Don't come over

981
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,520
I'm going to the hospital

982
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,520
Don't come over

983
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,520
I don't want to be involved in the women's movement

984
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,520
You're going to be the boss

985
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,520
I'm going to be the boss

986
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,520
You can't come over

987
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,520
I'm going to the hospital

988
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,520
I'm going to the hospital

989
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,520
You go back to the hospital

990
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,520
You go back to the hospital

991
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,520
You guys don't go over

992
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,520
What did you say?

993
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,520
You can come over

994
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,520
You're not a lawyer

995
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,520
You can come over

996
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,520
You're not a lawyer

997
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,520
You're not a lawyer

998
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,520
You're going to be the boss

999
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:23,520
You can't leave the divorce to them

1000
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,520
I'm going to tell them that I'm not going to be a good man

1001
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:29,520
I want to say that if I succeed in the black marriage

1002
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:32,520
I can make a lot of money

1003
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,520
I know

1004
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,520
You want to go back to the hospital?

1005
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,520
You're going to the hospital

1006
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,520
You're not a lawyer

1007
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,520
What is black marriage?

1008
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,520
It's the black jade box in the Netherlands

1009
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,520
It costs 300 to 800

1010
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,520
When I was in the 19th century

1011
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,520
I wrote a novel

1012
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,520
It's very good

1013
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,520
I borrowed a lot of money from the bank

1014
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,520
I borrowed a lot from the Netherlands

1015
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,520
But I failed to pay the jade

1016
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,520
I wrote all the money

1017
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,520
I'm going back to the Netherlands

1018
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,520
I helped you deal with the bill

1019
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:14,520
My jade box is broken

1020
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:19,520
My loan sharks have been gone for months

1021
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,520
You have to call me back

1022
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,520
I have to forget the inheritance debt

1023
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,520
I'm a monster now

1024
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,520
I'm a monster now

1025
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:33,520
I'm going to die

1026
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,520
I'm going to die

1027
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,520
I'm going to die

1028
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:41,520
I'm going to die

1029
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,520
I'm going to die

1030
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,520
What are you doing?

1031
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,520
Wait

1032
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:05,520
I'm going to die

1033
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,520
You just have to write a novel

1034
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:13,520
Cai Bei, your novel is so messy

1035
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,520
It's not funny at all

1036
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,520
I'll teach you how to write it

1037
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:21,520
What? Who do you want to write a novel?

1038
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,520
Cai Bei, your name is Hua Ye Cai

1039
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,520
What's the problem?

1040
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,520
The names on the book are to be written in the book

1041
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:41,520
And your birth date is to be written in the book

1042
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,520
The title is written on the book

1043
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,520
It's so troublesome

1044
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,520
I'm scared

1045
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,520
I'm not saying that I'm scared

1046
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,520
I'm going to die

1047
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:56,520
And who do you want to find?

1048
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,520
And your assets

1049
01:01:58,520 --> 01:01:59,520
My daughter

1050
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,520
Right, Cai Bei

1051
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,520
Your daughter is so filial

1052
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,520
I'm not like that

1053
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,520
If I tell you that I'm scared

1054
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,520
I'll die

1055
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,520
I'm not going to die

1056
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,520
I'm scared

1057
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,520
You're so funny

1058
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,520
Okay

1059
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,520
Your woman's name is here

1060
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,520
Her name is...

1061
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:26,520
A-Jiao

1062
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:29,520
No, she's Hua Jiao Fen

1063
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:32,520
Right, her mother's name is Huishesha

1064
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,520
And her birth name is Assa

1065
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:37,520
Do you know that?

1066
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,520
I'm the one who wrote the title of the book

1067
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,520
Thank you, Chun Ming

1068
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,520
A-Jiao, call her Hua Jiao Fen

1069
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,520
Call her a few times

1070
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,520
Don't be shy

1071
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,520
I've been going to school for a long time

1072
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,520
I'm not going to school, I'm going to work

1073
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,520
I'm going to work again

1074
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,520
Excuse me

1075
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:02,520
Come, cheers

1076
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,520
And her birth name?

01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:07,520
Your birth name is Assa

1078
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:10,520
I'm not scared

1079
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,520
Then call her

1080
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:16,520
No, it's noon

1081
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:20,520
I'll call her if I'm full

1082
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,520

1083
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:24,520

Ok

1097
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,520
I'm going to use a lot of toothpaste

1098
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,740
It's so easy to steal, you didn't even tell me yet and started to play I

1100

My son, you are so picky

1101
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:25,080
Why are you playing?

1102
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:27,420

1103
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:28,100

At a price

1108
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,700
Why can turn the big child over

1111
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,080
The hair is messy

1113
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:41,360

you can't have it

1138
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:24,580
and sure enough

1139
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,940
I can remember my heart

1140
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:30,920
Big brother

hear that

1142
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:36,060
Quiet

1143
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,740
it's great

1144
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:44,300
put down your Homelands

1145
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:47,180
Sleepier

1146
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:49,460
I love you

1147
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:51,460
I love you

1148
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:53,460
I love you

1149
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:55,460
You are so cute

1150
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:22,460
The End

1151
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:29,460
Mr. Ren Le

1152
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:33,460
I'll get you some soup with green bean soup

1153
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:38,460
That's right

1154
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:40,460
I can only stay in this small old house alone

1155
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:42,460
I can only drink green bean soup

1156
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:44,460
I suddenly feel like you are in a prison

1157
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:47,460
And I will be so embarrassed

1158
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:49,460
Then

1159
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:51,460
Come over and use it

1160
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:54,460
You can eat wherever you want to eat

1161
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:55,460
You decide for yourself

1162
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:57,460
I won't be alone

1163
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:16,460
Very good

1164
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:17,460
Thank you

1165
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:21,460
Actually

1166
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:25,460
I should say thank you to you

1167
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,460
The words are very funny

1168
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:32,460
It makes me laugh at the thought of being killed

1169
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:35,460
I'm really angry this morning

1170
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:38,460
I think you are heartless to help us

1171
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:40,460
You don't understand at all

1172
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:42,460
The land here is our meaning

1173
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:45,460
It's not just a place where we live

1174
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:47,460
If I don't have a home

1175
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:49,460
I can't raise a child

1176
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:52,460
So at the beginning

1177
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:55,460
I really welcome the purpose of coming here

1178
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:58,460
After all

1179
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:01,460
You are the future wife of Huanyun

1180
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:05,460
You are the wife of the chairman of the company

1181
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:07,460
I never said

1182
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:10,460
How do you know

1183
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:13,460
Because Tuoyue knows you

1184
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:16,460
So he knows how much you and Huizhao are related

1185
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:18,460
So this morning

1186
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:21,460
You went to our house to get the 500,000-dollar help

1187
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:23,460
I'm really angry

1188
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:25,460
Until I saw you

1189
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:27,460
So heartless to save A'Bei

1190
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:29,460
I only knew

1191
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:31,460
You are standing here

1192
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:34,460
I absolutely believe that as long as you are willing

1193
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:36,460
You can help us to keep this house

1194
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:41,460
Can you please

1195
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:43,460
Don't worry about those pessimistic thoughts

1196
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:45,460
Follow us to work hard

1197
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:47,460
There are so many places you don't go

1198
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:49,460
I'm afraid to be taken to the flower field

1199
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:54,460
I think that's not a coincidence

1200
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:57,460
I should have some special meaning

1201
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:09,460
We don't want that 500,000

1202
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:13,460
We just want to spend the day here

1203
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:16,460
As long as you give us a chance

1204
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:19,460
You can find that we deserve your help

1205
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:22,460
Please

1206
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:38,460
I finally know that

1207
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:52,460
The writing team can also make a good paper

1208
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:57,460
It seems that

1209
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,460
You don't need this

1210
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:02,460
Don't worry

1211
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:08,460
I'll give you a hand

1212
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:14,460
The first time

1213
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:22,460
The first time you smile at me after I came here

1214
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:25,460
You should smile at the cleaning factory

1215
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:27,460
Don't make mistakes

1216
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:30,460
I feel better when I work

1217
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:38,460
I'm so happy

1218
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:40,460
I'm so happy

1219
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:42,460
I'm so happy

1220
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:44,460
I'm so happy

1221
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:46,460
I'm so happy

1222
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:48,460
I'm so happy

1223
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:50,460
I'm so happy

1224
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:52,460
I'm so happy

1225
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:54,460
I'm so happy

1226
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:56,460
I'm so happy

1227
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:58,460
I'm so happy

1228
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:00,460
I'm so happy

1229
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:02,460
I'm so happy

1230
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:04,460
I'm so happy

1231
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:06,460
I'm so happy

1232
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:08,460
I'm so happy

1233
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:28,460
I'm so hungry

1234
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:30,460
I can't forget the porridge

1235
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:32,460
I have no father

1236
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:34,460
I'm so angry

1237
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:36,460
I run back when I bite him

1238
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:38,460
It's okay

1239
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:40,460
Who said it's okay?

1240
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:42,460
Even if you're bullied by a bad boy

1241
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:44,460
You're a good boy

1242
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:46,460
Yes

1243
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:48,460
You said you're a good boy

1244
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:50,460
You're a good boy

1245
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:52,460
He's a good boy

1246
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:54,460
He's a good boy

1247
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:56,460
You're a good boy

1248
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:59,460
I don't know what investment case we should open

1249
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:00,460
At least I can't see

1250
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:02,460
What must be bought from Hua Tianchun

1251
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:04,460
I don't think you need to worry about this

1252
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:06,460
I'll call the likes

1253
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:08,460
Everything will be fine

1254
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:10,460
Uncle

1255
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:12,460
Why are you so nice to me?

1256
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:14,460
This kid reminds me

1257
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:16,460
I should be honest and be honest

1258
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:18,460
I should work hard for you

1259
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:20,460
I'll work hard for Xiao Le

1260
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:22,460
As long as I'm here

1261
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:24,460
I'll take care of you and Xiao Le

1262
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:26,460
I'll protect you

1263
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:31,460
Yes

1264
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:33,460
Dad, you're here

1265
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:35,460
Thank you

1266
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:39,460
Thank you for giving me Xiao Le

1267
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:42,460
This kid

1268
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:48,460
Is the best person in my life

1269
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:01,460
Love

1270
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:04,460
I'm not a kid

1271
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:07,460
But I want to confess to you

1272
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:10,460
I just want to be loved by you

1273
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:13,460
Suddenly I want to love

1274
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:16,460
The most greedy person

1275
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:19,460
I want to eat the falling dumplings

1276
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:22,460
I'm comfortable

1277
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:26,460
I'm used to it

1278
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:29,460
Suddenly I understand

1279
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:34,460
It's not love

1280
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:38,460
I'm used to it

1281
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:41,460
I'm not a greedy person

1282
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:47,460
I'm not a greedy person

1283
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:52,460
I'm used to it

1284
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:55,460
Let's open our eyes

1285
01:13:55,460 --> 01:14:00,460
I can only look forward to everything

1286
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:04,460
We always fall in love

1287
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:08,460
We can't be separated

1288
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:13,460
I should be like this
