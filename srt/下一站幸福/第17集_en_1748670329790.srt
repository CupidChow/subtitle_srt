1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Next, we will broadcast for you, the next episode of Happiness

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,880
The sentence is not the most correct, it is a crime

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,000
So the defendant is sentenced to be accused of being innocent

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yes!

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Thank you for your mercy

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You are innocent, we both know it very well

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You wait and see

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I will never let you go

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:45,420
What is this

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Don't think that you are a fake

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
As long as your identity is in the back, you have my name

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I...

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You just sit there and be angry with me

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
She is forcing you, right?

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I want to be with Xiaolei

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
After all, she is Xiaolei's biological father

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And she works hard to make up for this relationship

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Maybe I should give her a chance

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What chance?

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Is she with Xiaolei?

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Or you and her?

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
They said Li Guangcai's case was a crime

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I don't know

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You are the one who took photos of Zheng Yan

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You are the one who has the chance

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I am the biggest intruder in my life

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Maybe I don't know the lawyer

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But I know the light

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So I know that she is not the one who wrote the report

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
If I didn't know, you would be a real scumbag

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You just looked at me

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You almost made me think you really know about me

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You are a scumbag

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The situation in the police department is similar to what you used to be

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
They only really know what they need

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I believe you should do that to make the best of Guangxi

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Xiaolei, what's wrong?

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You seem to be happy

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Come on, let's have a hug

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You are so cute

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Let me help you

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Is something wrong with the right-hand man?

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Is it a classmate or a teacher?

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What did I tell you?

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What did they say to Xiaolei?

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
They told me that

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You don't understand English

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You are so stubborn

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No wonder the classmate in Taipei is so stubborn

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It turns out that it's a classmate

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The stress in Taipei has been increased to kindergarten

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But don't worry, Xiaolei

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Because your parents will teach you

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I will teach you

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Mu Ze

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What?

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I want to talk to him

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I want to talk to him

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Can you lend me your phone?

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Mom

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Mu Ze, I want to talk to him

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Can you listen to me?

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Mu Ze, go ahead

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Xiaolei

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So you are here to do this

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yes, I went to the market the other day

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Even the most precious ice cream

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
All the ice cream in the market is dead

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I think you are still very stupid

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So I will bet on the score

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
One goes back to the second

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But don't do it again

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Chen Liao, listen

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
One goes back to the second

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
One goes back to the third

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
One goes back to the second

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yes

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The horse is running away

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The reward is the queen

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The treasure is Huang Jincheng

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The rich are rich

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The reward is the top

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The rich are rich

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The rich are rich

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The rich are rich

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The rich are rich

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I feel so sorry

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I will get the wound

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I will take you to the school

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You will be the one to take the rose

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Are you still mad at me?

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Shut up

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You are mad at me

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
He is so mean

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Hey, it's Jie Geng

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Can you not pick up?

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yes, you really can't pick up

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What if Jie Geng has an important thing to do?

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The newbie is on the head

100
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
He will be fine

101
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What are you doing? I am very busy now

102
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Jie Geng

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Xiao Le

104
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Jie Geng, Xiao Han

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Jie Geng

106
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Why are you still awake?

107
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What are you doing?

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I have a question

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I can't ask my dad

110
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I can't ask Mu Zhenzhe

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What question can't you ask them?

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What is a love story?

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Do you know what I mean?

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We help the Elin

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Dad is a love story

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Everyone is laughing

117
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Xiao Le is afraid of Mu Zhenzhe

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So he doesn't dare to ask

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Xiao Le, a love story

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
is not a curse

121
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's a Chinese saying

122
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
A is only a dress

123
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
A love story is a hat we wear

124
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Love story is

125
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's like a boy

126
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
He is very strong

127
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
He is better than a wild man

128
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
He wears a dress and wears a hat

129
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It looks very physical

130
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You are being too harsh

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Are you lying to me?

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Don't make me sad

133
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I am not lying to you

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You don't want to go to the hospital?

135
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You have a father now

136
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You forgot your wallet

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I don't want to say it

138
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Go to bed

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Where is it?

140
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I miss you so much

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I miss you so much

142
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You are in Hongdao now

143
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You only have the airship

144
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You forgot your car

145
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Where is it?

146
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I remember the small train

147
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It has no flowery smell

148
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
When Mu Zhenzhe is not here

149
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
He will take me out to play

150
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I miss you so much

151
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Mu Zhenzhe misses you too

152
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I miss you too

153
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Alright

154
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You can play at home

155
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
If there is anything you want to say to Mu Zhenzhe

156
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Just call me

157
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I am always here

158
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Alright?

159
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I have made a deal

160
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Who is the man in the party

161
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I will go with him

162
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I will go with him

163
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Alright, I am going back

164
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
This is not suitable for me

165
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And you

166
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You are not coming

167
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I am happy

168
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I am not interested in this place

169
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You are a bad boy

170
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You are a bad boy

171
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I will kick you

172
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I will kick you

173
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I will kick you

174
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Brother Fang

175
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I have a good idea

176
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You are so big

177
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You are a bad boy

178
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You should kick him

179
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
How do you want to eat this?

180
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I am so hungry

181
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
What are you doing?

182
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I wanna go home

183
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Mr. Duan

184
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I can walk you home

185
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Have you gone used to be a really editor?

186
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I have been attending CT

187
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Do you want me to show that stuff to you my friends?

188
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Alright

189
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
No

190
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Mr Duan

191
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Do you want to go home now?

192
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Mu Zhenzhe

193
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,200
I'm not at home.

194
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,600
I'm out to help Fang Ge.

195
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,200
What should I do?

196
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,600
I've been getting help from Fang Ge.

197
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,400
I'm so tired of this.

198
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
Let's save Chi Xin.

199
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,000
I don't know why Chi Xin is in Fang Ge's hands.

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,600
I'll find her.

201
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
I'll save her.

202
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
Chi Xin.

203
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,000
If you want to get close to Guang Xi,

204
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,800
you can go to the study room

205
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,800
and see if you've ever missed the person you met before.

206
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'll go to the study room.

207
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'll go to the study room.

208
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'll go to the study room.

209
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'll go to the study room.

210
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'll go to the study room.

211
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'll go to the study room.

212
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'll go to the study room.

213
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'll go to the study room.

214
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'll go to the study room.

215
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'll go to the study room.

216
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'll go to the study room.

217
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'll go to the study room.

218
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'll go to the study room.

219
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'll go to the study room.

220
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'll go to the study room.

221
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
When Guang Xi said he was a lawyer,

222
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I never thought he'd be successful today.

223
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
At that time, Guang Xi had a back-up test.

224
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
He was not good at balance,

225
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
and he was not good at acting.

226
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But he was willing to spend more time on his work than usual.

227
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
He stayed in the study room all day every day.

228
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The same script.

229
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Guang Xi wrote so many times.

230
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It seems that he really put a lot of effort into it.

231
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm so tired.

232
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm so tired.

233
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm so tired.

234
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm so tired.

235
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm so tired.

236
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm so tired.

237
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm so tired.

238
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm so tired.

239
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm so tired.

240
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm so tired.

241
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm so tired.

242
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm so tired.

243
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm so tired.

244
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm so tired.

245
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm so tired.

246
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
After the old school's surgery,

247
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I applied for a lawyer.

248
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What's the hardest thing?

249
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
After the surgery,

250
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
my visual sense and muscle sense

251
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
must be recovered by the part-time worker.

252
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
At that time, I was studying and preparing for my lawyer test.

253
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
But when I opened the books,

254
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It seemed to be dark in front of me

255
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I saw the back pain

256
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The doctor said I was too old

257
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I was not going to take a rest with my eyes

258
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
So I thought of a way

259
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
To use the recording method to record the hair

260
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
From that day on

261
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
My life was 268 years old

262
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Not a career

263
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The journey is hard

264
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Attack, stabbing the long-sword

265
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Attack, stabbing the long-sword

266
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
After the surgery

267
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I spent only three years

268
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
To be a lawyer

269
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It turned out that I spent so much effort every day

270
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
To pass the exam

271
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And to be a lawyer

272
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I have been insisting

273
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
What is the reason for being a lawyer

274
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Because I often dream

275
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
The dream of me

276
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
To win a lawsuit

277
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
There is a person who is very important to me

278
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Although I do not remember who he is

279
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
But I remember his nonsense

280
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
His tears

281
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
The reason why I will try so hard to be a lawyer

282
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Is because I only work hard

283
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
To have that kind of sense of humanity

284
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Maybe I can find myself for you

285
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
To see

286
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Is a very rude behavior

287
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Did I ever call you when you were in the study?

288
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I...

289
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I did not expect

290
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You would be a lawyer because of the investigation

291
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Six years ago

292
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's very stupid

293
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
For a reason that has no meaning

294
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Of course it is

295
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
In fact, you do not remember anything

296
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But in your heart

297
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You still remember that justice

298
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I am very cool to be a lawyer

299
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
For this reason

300
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So what?

301
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Now everyone thinks I am a person who has no feelings

302
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
That's not it

303
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
In the end

304
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You also fought for Miss Wu

305
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You are so greedy

306
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What does it mean to fight for that money?

307
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
That girl

308
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You will not feel good because of this

309
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Otherwise she will not be a suicide

310
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Guangxi

311
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's late

312
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You should have said what you should have said

313
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It should have been late

314
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You should go to rest

315
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I have something to do

316
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I have something to say

317
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
The lawyer from Jinyan is here to see you

318
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I know

319
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I have received the message

320
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I am afraid that the public will investigate

321
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I will handle it myself

322
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You do not have to care about it

323
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Then I will not worry about you

324
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I am afraid that the public will investigate

325
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I am afraid that the public will investigate

326
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I am afraid that the public will investigate

327
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I am afraid that the public will investigate

328
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I am afraid that the public will investigate

329
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I am afraid that the public will investigate

330
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I am afraid that the public will investigate

331
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I am afraid that the public will investigate

332
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I am afraid that the public will investigate

333
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I am afraid that the public will investigate

334
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I am afraid that the public will investigate

335
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I am afraid that the public will investigate

336
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I am afraid that the public will investigate

337
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I am afraid that the public will investigate

338
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Hello

339
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Hello

340
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Hello

341
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I am here to see her

342
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
We will be there by 5.30pm

343
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Okay

344
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Bye

345
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Hello

346
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Miss Gu

347
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I want to ask you about the law of her house

348
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Which ward are you in?

349
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You are...

350
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I am the representative of the law

351
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I want to apologize to her

352
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
She is in 501

353
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Thank you

354
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Okay

355
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Miss Liang, I remind you

356
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Miss Wu's situation is very bad

357
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Sometimes she doesn't show her face

358
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Sometimes she just gives up

359
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Sometimes she is very obedient

360
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Most of them are women who are often reported to be killed

361
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
or killed

362
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You represent the law

363
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Be careful not to hurt her

364
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Miss Wu

365
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Miss Wu

366
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Miss Wu

367
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Miss Wu

368
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Miss Wu

369
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Miss Wu

370
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Miss Wu

371
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Miss Wu

372
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Miss Wu

373
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Miss Wu

374
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Miss Wu

375
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Are you new here?

376
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You said you would come to see me

377
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Help me make a wish

378
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Actually I am...

379
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Actually you really don't need to come to see me

380
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Because...

381
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I know how to make a decision

382
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You have many ways to go

383
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's not the best choice to make a decision

384
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I knew you would say that

385
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
In the movie

386
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You act like this

387
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You are a good employee

388
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You want to help the girl who is killed

389
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
But...

390
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You don't know anything

391
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
How painful it is

392
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
How painful it is

393
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I am sorry

394
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Let me help you

395
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Don't worry

396
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Actually I can understand everything you said

397
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
What you want is a letter of trust

398
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I know you are painful

399
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Because you have a wound in your heart

400
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Is it good?

401
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's only up to you

402
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
This is really something others don't understand

403
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I have met someone

404
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Who has the same kind of treatment as you

405
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
He lives in the same house

406
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
But becomes the most terrible beast

407
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Every night

408
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Whether it's a bath

409
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Or a sleep

410
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
He checks the door several times

411
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Even in his room

412
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
He has a three-story bed

413
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Because he is afraid

414
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
He is afraid that anyone will hurt him

415
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
He is afraid that every minute

416
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
All become a fear

417
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Then

418
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
How did he live

419
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Until that girl

420
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
When she almost couldn't eat

421
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
He met someone

422
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Accompany him

423
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Encourage him

424
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Let him know that this

425
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Can't be continued

426
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
He is lucky

427
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
After my mother died

428
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Only me left

429
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
If time can turn around

430
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
This knife

431
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I will never hurt myself

432
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I will become like this

433
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It's because that beast

434
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
This despicable lawyer is helping him

435
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Actually that lawyer is unwilling

436
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
How do you know he is unwilling

437
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Because

438
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Because I am his family

439
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I will become like this

440
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I will become like this

441
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I will become like this

442
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I will become like this

443
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I will become like this

444
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I will become like this

445
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I will become like this

446
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I will become like this

447
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I will become like this

448
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I will become like this

449
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I will become like this

450
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I will become like this

451
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I will become like this

452
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I will become like this

453
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
This lawyer is unwilling

454
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
How do you know he is unwilling

455
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Because

456
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Because I am his family

457
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I represent him to see you

458
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And express his apology

459
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
You must believe me

460
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
He is unwilling

461
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
He is regretting this time

462
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
How do you know

463
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I am on the court

464
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I am not able to get out of this

465
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
He is the old ghost

466
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
How can I know

467
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
This is because of this

468
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I want to know

469
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
This is because of this

470
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I don't have any rights

471
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I don't have any evidence

472
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
All the law and law are against

473
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
They are lying to me

474
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Please be serious

475
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Get out of here

476
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
What are you doing

477
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I

478
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Get out

479
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You hurt me

480
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Who

481
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
He

482
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
He hurt me

483
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
You hurt me

484
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Look at his wound

485
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And his wound is burned

486
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Miss

487
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Miss

488
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Miss Wu

489
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I beg you

490
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Don't hurt yourself

491
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You are not wrong

492
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
about this

493
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Your youth

494
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Your life

495
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
There must be a chance

496
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Please believe me

497
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Lawyer

498
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
He is regretting this time

499
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I am fine

500
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I am fine

501
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Sorry

502
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I am sorry

503
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I know you are sorry

504
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
But in this situation

505
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It's useless to apologize to him

506
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I am sorry

507
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I am sorry

508
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
But I am worried about his condition

509
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I will leave my phone number

510
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
If he needs help

511
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Call me

512
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Sorry

513
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Sorry

514
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Sorry

515
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Sorry

516
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Sorry

517
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Sorry

518
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Sorry

519
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Sorry

520
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Sorry

521
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Sorry

522
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Sorry

523
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Sorry

524
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
When Xiao Le went to the beauty class

525
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And fought with her

526
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
She even made her husband suffer

527
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
She didn't want to tell him

528
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
She just said

529
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Don't call your parents

530
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
They will feel sad

531
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
So I called the manager

532
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
And he came over

533
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
You know

534
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
The kind of crying child

535
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Is not worth it

536
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Mr. Fang

537
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Please don't blame Xiao Le

538
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
He is good

539
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Maybe he just got to the new environment

540
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
He is not used to it

541
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
The children are sensitive

542
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
So we want to ask the manager

543
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Please don't blame Xiao Le

544
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Uncle will pay for you

545
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,640
This time, maybe my shoesان

546
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,480
might not look good Excitement

547
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,100
If I go to Qiuyuan and wanted him to be with me

548
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,220
She said he deserves it

549
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,520
Play with ISIL

550
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,440
Yes

551
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,120
Wait

552
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,560
I look if you need money

553
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,960
I'll go

554
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Then why don't you tell the teacher?

555
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I want to protect my father.

556
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Don't let him know that everyone is scolding him.

557
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Just like your father, he's just like a little bird.

558
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Dad, is there something like that?

559
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
When your father was young,

560
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
if anyone dares to say his father's bad words,

561
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
he will be angry and will fight with others.

562
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Is there a reason?

563
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
No matter what the reason, fighting is wrong.

564
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
But he has a promise.

565
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Yes.

566
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I know that you're a mother.

567
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I won't fight anymore.

568
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I promise.

569
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Big brother.

570
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Wow.

571
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Wow, your hands are so pretty.

572
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
They're so soft.

573
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Uncle Chenyin, I'll listen to you.

574
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Be good to me.

575
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
What else?

576
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I want to know what you like and hate.

577
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
When your father was young,

578
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
he liked to play the wheel of the wheel of the wheel.

579
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
He hates eating the red radish.

580
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
What if he wants to play the wheel of the wheel?

581
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
He'll be wrong if he tries to play the wheel of the wheel.

582
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
How can he choose?

583
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
A child shouldn't be a liar.

584
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
He should be used to eating well.

585
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,000
But your father's biggest advantage is not that he's smart,

586
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
but that he'll stick to his goal.

587
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
That's why he's successful today.

588
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
You'll be like him when you grow up.

589
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I'll be your father.

590
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I'll be your father.

591
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I'll be your father.

592
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I'll be your father.

593
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I'll be your father.

594
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I'll be your father.

595
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I'll be your father.

596
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I'll be your father.

597
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I'll be your father.

598
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I'll be your father.

599
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I'm sorry.

600
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I'm sorry.

601
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Where are you going this afternoon?

602
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Remember, you have a baby.

603
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Do not come here, or be a rich man.

604
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
You have no idea what's going on in your school.

605
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
You also have to be smart in such a small environment.

606
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
You have to start over.

607
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Start over.

608
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Since you brought her here,

609
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
you should be more considerate about her.

610
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Got it?

611
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Yes. I'll take care of her next time.

612
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I hope you remember your promise today.

613
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
You've never been so sensible to your children.

614
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
You're afraid your parents might worry about you.

615
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
You should ask your grandma to take care of the problem.

616
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
You should be more considerate about your children.

617
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Don't ever do this again.

618
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Thank you.

619
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
994466 COM

620
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
What's up?

621
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I'm calling you on the phone and the reporter.

622
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Tell me if you have something to say.

623
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I just want to tell you

624
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
if there's anything I need help,

625
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
you can tell me.

626
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Just like you told me that day,

627
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I just want to make sure that you're fine.

628
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Don't you think it's a shame?

629
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
We've had enough of it.

630
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
You should be happy now.

631
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
You're the most annoying man in the world.

632
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Are you satisfied?

633
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
What? Did I say something wrong?

634
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Don't you think so?

635
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I'm not.

636
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Please don't use your attitude and tone to question me.

637
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I'm not your enemy.

638
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
But you're the one who said that.

639
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
What's wrong?

640
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Nothing.

641
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Why do you keep hiding things from me?

642
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I went to see Miss Wu today.

643
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
She accidentally got hot water on her.

644
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
But it's okay.

645
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Enough.

646
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I hate you for always thinking about others.

647
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Think about it for yourself.

648
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
It's your fault.

649
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I'm your family.

650
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
That's why I did this.

651
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
You told me

652
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
you don't have the right to be a king.

653
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
So I'm very content.

654
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I have doubts about this case.

655
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
But because of your lawyer identity,

656
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
you didn't help that girl do anything.

657
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
But I can help you.

658
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
What do you want?

659
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Just like you helped me.

660
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I said

661
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
no matter what the final result is,

662
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I don't care anymore.

663
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Because you were with me at that time.

664
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
And you believed in me.

665
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Remember?

666
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I used to be with you.

667
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
But now this girl is really lonely.

668
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
So I want to help her.

669
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
No matter she is accepted,

670
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I should do it.

671
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
People in the world are all criticizing you.

672
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Remember?

673
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Your family will not leave you.

674
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
If someone is in the world,

675
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
they will bully Xiao Le.

676
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:53,020
Xiao Le will go to the

677
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,020
half-term for his father.

678
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,020
Because we all believe that

679
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,020
your actions are made by thinking.

680
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Do you believe what you said?

681
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Of course.

682
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I can't believe what you said is true.

683
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Of course.

684
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Hello?

685
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
What?

686
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I have something to talk to you.

687
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I have something to talk to you.

688
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Thank you.

689
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
The hospital has been hit and Miss Zhong Wu has passed away.

690
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Don't panic.

691
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Think about it.

692
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
What did you just say?

693
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
If time can turn around,

694
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
this knife...

695
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I will never use it.

696
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Guangxi, where is the talent you are looking for?

697
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
If you don't have the talent,

698
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
you can always use the key.

699
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I have something to talk to you.

700
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Or I will kill you.

701
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
It's useless.

702
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I will kill you.

703
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
You are my soulmate.

704
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
What should I do?

705
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Sorry.

706
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I can't remember.

707
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
It's you.

708
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I will kill you.

709
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Don't.

710
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Mother.

711
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Dong Zhijie.

712
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Lake Xiao.

713
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Lake Xiao.

714
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I'm so sorry.

715
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I'm so sorry.

716
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I'm sorry.

717
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I'm sorry.

718
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I'm sorry.

719
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I'm fine. I'm fine.

720
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Don't be afraid.

721
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Wait. I'll go back to the hospital with you.

722
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I won't let you be alone again.

723
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I once wanted to do this to that bad guy.

724
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
But before that, I met him.

725
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,000
He was with me, so I didn't let these pains continue to torment me.

726
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I'm sorry.

727
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I'm sorry.

728
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I'm sorry.

729
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
If I had told you earlier,

730
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
things wouldn't have been like this.

731
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I wouldn't have apologized to you in court.

732
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Because that was my job.

733
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
As long as I went to the law firm,

734
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
my work was done by the law.

735
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I said every word I said.

736
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
It was all for my own good.

737
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
You probably couldn't understand why I did this.

738
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I can only say that this is my career.

739
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I want to apologize to you.

740
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I was wronged by my conscience.

741
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I forgot about this case.

742
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Even if I had already apologized to him,

743
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I would have never apologized to him.

744
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
This is what I feel sorry for.

745
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I'm still inside.

746
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
This isn't your fault.

747
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
There's a part of you

748
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
that I didn't mean to hurt him

749
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
because I was so desperate to get involved.

750
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I know.

751
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I know this is your job.

752
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
But do you know that?

753
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I feel so sorry for you.

754
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I feel so sorry for you.

755
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I understand.

756
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
What you need is our understanding of your confidence.

757
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Do you know?

758
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Your wife

759
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
said the same thing to you.

760
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I didn't listen to her.

761
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Your feelings must be very good.

762
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
That's why you're so desperate.

763
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
You can be so selfish to help others.

764
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Maybe because we've experienced a lot of things.

765
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I'm sorry.

766
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Can there be someone who can help you?

767
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Don't be so selfish.

768
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I'm sorry.

769
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
But...

770
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
But I still have to be patient.

771
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
You know, there's really no one.

772
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
What should I do?

773
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Hello?

774
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Fang Xi, I've got all the things you gave to Rui.

775
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Are you sure you want to do this?

776
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
You should know better than anyone else

777
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
how much influence you have on your life.

778
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
The whole family will come down at any time.

779
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I'm very sure.

780
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
And since I did it,

781
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I won't take any more consequences.

782
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Okay.

783
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Don't worry. I'll take care of it for you.

784
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Okay.

785
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I have a gift for you.

786
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I think you still don't like it.

787
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
You're so stubborn.

788
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
You're the one who's been forced to do this.

789
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I'm not injured.

790
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
You're in a crazy situation.

791
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
You're not going to see him.

792
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Why are you staying here?

793
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I want to go back.

794
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I'm not going to the hospital.

795
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I don't care about that.

796
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I want to go back.

797
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Mr. Police Officer,

798
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
this is a light stick that Mr. Ren Guangxi asked me to bring.

799
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Please check the light stick and decide whether you want to fire him.

800
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
What are you doing?

801
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Who sent you here?

802
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
That's right.

803
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
The person you heard.

804
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
You can close your mouth and let the police see the light stick.

805
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
After that, you can continue to accept the next legal procedure.

806
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Of course, you can continue to be arrogant.

807
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
But as a lawyer, I want to warn you.

808
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
The so-called future law enforcement will become important evidence.

809
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
You're going to follow up on this matter.

810
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
He wants to arrest the lawyer.

811
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I think you'll get him.

812
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Get in the car.

813
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Is someone here?

814
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Scotland.

815
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Liu Rong, just now Guangxi asked me to hand over the light rail to the police

816
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
How did you let him do this?

817
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Didn't you persuade him?

818
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
No, because this is a very difficult and unambitious decision

819
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I can't even have this kind of courage

820
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I think you should be like this, Guangxi

821
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Forget it, he can do whatever he wants

822
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Also, I'll ask you to do me a favor

823
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
And only you, the mayor of Fangdong, can do it

824
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
The day after tomorrow

825
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
How is it?

826
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Xiao Lian has told me how you handled the light rail

827
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
You don't want to think how hard it was to have the first position today

828
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
You're a little reckless

829
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I don't know who you are in love with

830
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:18,000
In fact, in the future, you can discuss with me

831
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Maybe I'll help you to get some points

832
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
And then I won't be too serious

833
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
You'll definitely help me

834
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Won't you be the best at cleaning up the mess?

835
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I've already given you the money you asked me to help

836
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
This is what the mayor of Shengde University can do

837
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I'll be the best at cleaning up the mess

838
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Is this really okay?

839
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Mom, can you take out the light rail?

840
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I can't take it tomorrow

841
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
But...

842
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Don't worry, my family has a lot of money

843
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
It's okay to take it for a year

844
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
And my family is a school

845
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I want to use my ability to go to the law school

846
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
There must be no problem

847
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Don't you believe it?

848
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
You'll know when you get to Shengde University

849
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I'll give you the information about the school

850
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
There's a law in the entrance exam

851
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
And a certificate of scholarship

852
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
If possible, you can give me the answer tomorrow morning

853
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Mr. Sheng

854
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Maybe the tragedy is just the beginning of a woman's life

855
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
But it doesn't mean the ending

856
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
You can come back

857
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Thank you

858
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Let's go inside

859
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Thank you

860
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
What do you want?

861
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Thank you for giving that girl a chance to be reborn

862
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Just like when you were a baby

863
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
You want to say thank you to me for such a small thing

864
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
You'll be hurt

865
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I should give you a hand

866
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Now, the house

867
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I really want to thank you

868
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
What do you want to say?

869
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I...

870
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Can you go to the mountains with me?

871
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I was in the hospital just now

872
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I was just lying down and sitting down

873
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I really want to walk

874
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Okay

875
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I forgot you're interested in this girl

876
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I'm not interested in you

877
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I'm not interested in you

878
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I'm not interested in you

879
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I'm not interested in you

880
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I'm not interested in you

881
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I'm not interested in you

882
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I'm not interested in you

883
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I'm not interested in you

884
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I'm not interested in you

885
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I'm not interested in you

886
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I'm not interested in you

887
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I'm not interested in you

888
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I'm not interested in you

889
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I'm not interested in you

890
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I'm not interested in you

891
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I'm not interested in your

892
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I'm not interested in your

893
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
But this place

894
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Why do you have such a small bird?

895
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Maybe it fell down from the tree

896
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I wonder if it was injured

897
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Six years ago, we didn't have a child.

898
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:48,300
I just remember that you care about me like six years ago.

899
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:02,700
That bird nest should be his home.

900
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,020
You know.

901
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,500
Be careful.

902
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,360
Too heavy

903
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,160
It's so heavy

904
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,640
I pull the strings

905
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,520
Be careful

906
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,120
With all my strength

907
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,540
I had to put in the space

908
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,000
When love

909
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:01,920
made us

910
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,120
a Lee

911
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,060
in our dreams

912
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:09,060
The light in the street

913
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:17,060
Don't ask me

914
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:20,060
Just hold me

915
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:21,060
Be careful

916
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,060
I'm telling you

917
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,060
You can't tell anyone

918
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:26,060
I'm so sincere

919
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:28,060
Otherwise, I'll be so bad at this

920
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,060
Be careful

921
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:38,060
I dare to forget

922
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:40,060
I think after I become a mother

923
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:42,060
I think in the next six years

924
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:44,060
Who will change?

925
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,060
But

926
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:47,060
I just found out

927
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:49,060
I've found out many things

928
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:51,060
Actually, there's no one

929
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:55,060
Six years later

930
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,060
I still have a lot of feelings

931
00:55:58,060 --> 00:55:59,060
But

932
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:02,060
You still don't know me

933
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:06,060
No matter who is that girl

934
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:08,060
Or Xiaoyang

935
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:11,060
Or the girl who was with you

936
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:13,060
Or Xiaoyang

937
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:18,060
Who knows that the six years later

938
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:20,060
Will still be the same

939
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:22,060
I'm the only one who's lost

940
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:24,060
I'm still with you

941
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:27,060
Aren't you leaving?

942
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:29,060
Let's go

943
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:34,060
Let's go

944
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:05,060
What are they doing?

945
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:07,060
We'll be there for two hours

946
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:09,060
Don't be anxious

947
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:11,060
They should be nearby

948
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:13,060
They must be watching us

949
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:15,060
They must be afraid we'll be exposed

950
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:17,060
Wait a minute

951
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:19,060
I'm not anxious

952
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,060
I'm afraid Fang is in danger

953
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:23,060
Fang is the most cruel person

954
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:25,060
He makes money

955
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:27,060
Sometimes he even doesn't even give them food

956
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:29,060
Fang hasn't used the drug control

957
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:31,060
If the drug control doesn't work

958
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:33,060
They'll be in trouble

959
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:35,060
They'll be in trouble

960
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:50,060
I heard you and Fang

961
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:53,060
When they were trying to save Binzai

962
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:55,060
I helped you to beg

963
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:57,060
Take it

964
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:01,060
Actually you know

965
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:04,060
Since my biological mother

966
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:06,060
I've been using a chicken mother

967
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:08,060
And a chicken mother

968
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:11,060
I'm here to take care of you

969
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:13,060
To take care of you

970
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:26,060
Come on

971
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:29,060
Come on

972
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:31,060
Come on

973
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:33,060
Come on

974
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:37,060
Come on

975
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:42,060
I've been thinking about buying soy sauce

976
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:46,060
People are here

977
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:48,060
It's better to say it

978
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:50,060
I've been here for a long time

979
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:52,060
I regret it

980
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:54,060
Maybe

981
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:57,060
He'll sell you out soon

982
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:59,060
I miss you

983
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:03,060
Come on

984
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:07,060
I'm sorry

985
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:10,060
I'm sorry

986
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:20,060
I'm sorry

987
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:22,060
You're not going to be happy

988
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:24,060
You're not going to be happy?

989
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:30,060
I'm not happy

990
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:32,060
You can change your clothes and go to the store

991
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:36,060
I'm sorry

992
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:38,060
You're not going to be happy

993
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:43,060
I'm sorry

994
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:46,060
Thank you

995
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:54,060
Thank you

996
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:56,060
Thank you

997
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:58,060
Thank you

998
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:10,060
Come on, get ready

999
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:12,060
Get ready

1000
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:13,060
Shit

1001
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:15,060
Dad

1002
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:20,060
The food is coming

1003
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:21,060
Mother

1004
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:22,060
Here

1005
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:23,060
Give me

1006
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:26,060
You're so shy

1007
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:29,060
For you

1008
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:32,060
Come

1009
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:37,060
To sea

1010
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:38,060
It's the late night

1011
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:40,460
The end of your feelings

1012
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:43,660
I'm with you wholeheartedly

1013
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:46,860
You don't care about everything

1014
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:49,860
Maybe I'm too naive

1015
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:51,260
You're the one who's been through everything

1016
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:53,460
What does this mean?

1017
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:55,860
That you're the one who's been through everything

1018
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:59,660
It means that you're the one who's been through everything

1019
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:03,460
Actually, you don't have to care who's your biological parents now

1020
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:07,060
You don't have to care who's your biological parents now

1021
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:12,460
The important thing is that as long as you're a single-minded flower

1022
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,860
You're the daughter of our flower family

1023
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:18,460
You're also the sister of my flower family

1024
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:23,460
I and A'Lu will always be our family

1025
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:25,660
I'll always be your guardian

1026
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:27,660
I'll always be happy

1027
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:33,460
Don't cry

1028
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:40,060
I'll always be happy

1029
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:43,260
You don't care about everything

1030
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:46,460
Maybe I'm too naive

1031
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:50,060
You're the one who's been through everything

1032
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:53,060
It means that you're the one who's been through everything

1033
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:56,260
But you're still smiling

1034
01:01:56,260 --> 01:02:02,460
You thought you'd be the one to stay

1035
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:05,660
I thought I was strong

1036
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:08,660
But I'm so desperate

1037
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:12,060
Give me a little hope

1038
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:19,260
Hope is not despair

1039
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:21,860
Silly girl

1040
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:24,860
Why are you still going out like this?

1041
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:32,460
So you're the one who's been through everything

1042
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:38,660
I'll always be your guardian

1043
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:41,660
I'll always be your guardian

1044
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:46,660
The End

1045
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:57,660
Dawei, don't be so hard on me

1046
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:07,660
You're the one who's been through everything

1047
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:09,660
Thank you

1048
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:16,660
The End

1049
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:28,660
Dawei, wait

1050
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:31,660
Don't be so hard on me

1051
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,660
The End

1052
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,160
sweetness

1053
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:45,100
The first ever press æ

1054
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:47,160
was very frustrating

1055
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:49,160
On impulse

1056
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,100
onayd silk

1057
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:55,900
One month oversaw

1065
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:35,700
I wonder how my真的太太 could not love...

1066
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:45,960
Identify both of them to leave each other's lines for 갊다.

1067
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:48,840
Such a great story!

1068
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:53,980
Why turns out I'm never sour in a game like your footage of me grinning?

1069
01:04:55,660 --> 01:04:58,500
That was when we first started coffee 마지막에.

1070
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,500
You're a fool. You're a fool.

1071
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,500
You're a fool.

1072
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,500
I don't want to see anyone but you.

1073
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,500
You're going to tell me to get you out of here.

1074
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,500
I know you're here.

1075
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:12,500
Brother.

1076
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:14,500
I know you force him to do the transfer.

1077
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:15,500
Give it to me.

1078
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:21,500
Don't tell him to leave.

1079
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:25,500
That's because you have me.

1080
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,500
You know what you're doing.

1081
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,500
Don't you dare to tell me.

1082
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:33,500
I'm a thief.

1083
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,500
I'm going to kill you.

1084
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,500
You're a fool.

1085
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:39,500
You're a fool.

1086
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,500
You're going to tell me to get you out of here.

1087
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,500
What's wrong with you?

1088
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:45,500
You're going to tell me to get you out of here.

1089
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,500
Why is his mother so useless?

1090
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,500
It's me who's going to tell you.

1091
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,500
What's wrong with him?

1092
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:52,500
Let go of me.

1093
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,500
Let go of me.

1094
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,500
He's a fool.

1095
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,500
It's none of my business.

1096
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,500
You know what?

1097
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:05,500
You're a fool.

1098
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,500
You're a fool.

1099
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:09,500
I'm going to kill him.

1100
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,500
You're a fool.

1101
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,500
You're going to kill him.

1102
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,500
Let go of me.

1103
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:22,500
I don't want to see you.

1104
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:26,500
You're going to spend money on your father.

1105
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:28,500
You're going to spend money on your father.

1106
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:31,500
You're going to spend money on your father.

1107
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:34,500
Don't talk about this nonsense.

1108
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:36,500
I'm going to tell you that.

1109
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,500
I'm going to kill him.

1110
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,500
What?

1111
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,500
You don't even know how to throw away your trash?

1112
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,500
You're going to kill him.

1113
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,500
You're going to kill him.

1114
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,500
No!

1115
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,500
No!

1116
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,500
Dad, what are you doing?

1117
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:06,500
I'll kill you!

1118
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,500
You want money?

1119
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:12,500
Okay, I'll give you the money right now!

1120
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:15,500
That bastard is a bastard.

1121
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,500
You're not going to do anything.

1122
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:21,500
You're going to kill me!

1123
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,500
Dad!

1124
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,500
Dad!

1125
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:33,500
Dad!

1126
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:36,500
Dad!

1127
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:38,500
Dad!

1128
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:40,500
Dad!

1129
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,500
Dad!

1130
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:46,500
Dad!

1131
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:48,500
Dad!

1132
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,500
Dad!

1133
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:57,500
Dad!

1134
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:11,500
You want money?

1135
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,500
Yes.

1136
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,500
Dad!

1137
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,500
Si Qing!

1138
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:27,500
What's wrong?

1139
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:29,500
Dad!

1140
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:31,500
Si Qing!

1141
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,500
Si Qing!

1142
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,500
Si Qing!

1143
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:45,500
Si Qing!

1144
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:47,500
I'm sorry.

1145
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:49,500
I'm sorry.

1146
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,500
You're a fool.

1147
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,500
You can go home now.

1148
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:14,500
I'm going to ask you to cook.

1149
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,500
You're a good cook.

1150
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,500
I'm going to ask you to cook.

1151
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:22,500
It's easy for you to listen to me.

1152
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,500
Three bowls.

1153
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,500
One bowl.

1154
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,500
You can't just watch me cook.

1155
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,500
Just a bowl.

1156
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:35,500
It's very simple.

1157
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,500
You can't just give up.

1158
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:39,500
I'll give you water.

1159
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,500
If you don't want to eat a bowl,

1160
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,500
you can just go home.

1161
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:47,500
It's also a good way to cook.

1162
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,500
You're going to be a good cook.

1163
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,500
I'll be back.

1164
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,500
Si Qing.

1165
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,500
Si Qing!

1166
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,500
Si Qing!

1167
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,500
Si Qing!

1168
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,500
Si Qing!

1169
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,500
Si Qing!

1170
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:12,500
Si started to eat dirty food.

1171
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:15,500
Probably the one that uses this fat manner.

1172
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,500
La broker.

1173
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:19,500
La broker,

1174
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:22,500
are you in good shape now?

1175
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,500
We haven't been together.

1176
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:27,500
Prepare this dinner before we get to eat.

1177
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,500
Don't worry like this.

1178
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,500
Get changed.

1179
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:34,500
I opened this.

1180
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:36,500
Things about?

1181
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:37,500
What's on your mind?

1182
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:38,500
I'll take your eyes off.

1183
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:40,500
Look at you now.

1184
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,500
You're like a dog that's been bitten by a monkey.

1185
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:43,500
You're not just a man.

1186
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:44,500
How could that be?

1187
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:46,500
I used to be a student in the university.

1188
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,500
That's good. Boss.

1189
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,500
You should return to the world of two people.

1190
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,500
The simplest love of the village.

1191
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:53,500
The reason why men can't do anything is

1192
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:55,500
because they're waiting for a woman to finish it.

1193
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:57,500
Maybe for so many years,

1194
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:58,500
I'll never be a leader.

1195
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,500
It's because I'm waiting for someone.

1196
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:02,500
Have you done your homework?

1197
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:04,500
I did a homework.

1198
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,500
I want to invite everyone to go to the school

1199
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:07,500
to celebrate the birthday of the girl.

1200
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:08,500
I'll take you there.

1201
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:09,500
Yay!

1202
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:10,500
I'm going to work!

1203
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:16,500
You've become more attractive in the past six years.

1204
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:17,500
I'm going to your room.

1205
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:18,500
Take your time.

1206
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:19,500
You've been here for so long.

1207
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,500
You should be thirsty.

1208
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:21,500
Drink some water.

1209
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:22,500
Boss.

1210
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,500
It's okay if your wife is still in the care of this little thing.

1211
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:26,500
Why do you always use these two?

1212
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,500
Do you have a new method?

1213
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:29,500
Why don't you see it clearly?

1214
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,500
You're using the same method

1215
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:32,500
to hurt us.

1216
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:34,500
But the result

1217
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,500
makes us closer.

1218
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:38,500
If you're willing,

1219
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,500
I hope we can find the six years ago.

1220
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:44,500
All my heart and soul

1221
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,500
exist for each other.

1222
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,500
My love.

1223
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:38,500
I'm not afraid of love.

1224
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:40,500
I'm not afraid of love.

1225
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:42,500
I'm not afraid of love.

1226
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,500
I'm not afraid of love.

1227
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:46,500
I'm not afraid of love.

1228
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,500
I'm not afraid of love.

1229
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:50,500
I'm not afraid of love.

1230
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,500
I'm not afraid of love.

1231
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:54,500
I'm not afraid of love.

1232
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:56,500
I'm not afraid of love.

1233
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,500
I'm not afraid of love.

1234
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,500
I'm not afraid of love.

1235
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:02,500
I'm not afraid of love.

1236
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,500
I'm not afraid of love.

1237
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:06,500
I'm not afraid of love.

1238
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,500
I'm not afraid of love.

1239
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,500
I'm not afraid of love.

1240
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,500
I'm not afraid of love.

1241
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,500
I'm not afraid of love.

1242
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:16,500
I'm not afraid of love.

1243
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,500
I'm not afraid of love.

1244
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:20,500
I'm not afraid of love.

1245
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:22,500
I'm not afraid of love.

1246
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:24,500
I'm not afraid of love.

1247
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,500
I'm not afraid of love.

1248
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:28,500
I'm not afraid of love.

1249
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,500
I'm not afraid of love.
