(Is It Worth It for a Dead Person)

15
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,530
Miss Tang.

16
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,690
Miss Tang, what's the matter?

17
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:08,610
Are you not feeling well?

18
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,930
I just indulged my craving
and had a bit of this fine wine.

19
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,130
I'm a bit tipsy.

20
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,610
Look what wine you're holding.

21
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,970
This is cooking wine.
It's not supposed to be drunk.

22
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:29,490
This one.

23
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,410
This is the fine wine.

24
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:33,730
Let me hold it.

25
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,290
I'll take it to them.

26
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,410
Alright.

27
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,290
Be careful, Miss Tang.

28
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,250
Fa Wuwei,

29
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,050
I'm going to kill you

30
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:58,970
to avenge my master!

31
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,050
Childish.

32
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,890
You traitor.

33
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,850
You conspired against the Emperor
and killed my master.

34
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,090
Today, I will see
that you pay it with your life.

35
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,130
Is it worth it

36
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:20,530
for a dead person?

37
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,690
How cold-blooded and merciless you are.

38
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,010
You let down my master's sincerity.

39
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:37,890
At this point,

40
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,770
words are useless.

41
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,370
Stop!

42
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,290
Mi'er, what are you doing?

43
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,890
Young master, are you hurt?

44
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,090
He is the one who killed my master.

45
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,290
Nonsense.

46
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,090
You must be mistaken.

47
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,770
How could he possibly murder?

48
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,530
You don't believe it?

49
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:06,930
Alright.

50
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,130
Miss Tang, why don't you
ask him yourself?

51
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,410
How many people have been killed by him?

52
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,330
You cold-blooded murderer!

53
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,330
I kindly invited you as a guest.

54
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,890
How could you slander him like this?

55
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,210
You think

56
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,130
you can kill me

57
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,690
just by yourself?

58
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:24,850
You!

59
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,090
If it hadn't been
for the sake of my wife,

60
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,370
you would have become a corpse.

61
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,330
Get out of here!

62
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,410
Lin Mi'er,

63
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,530
you're fooling around.

64
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,050
If you continue
to make a fuss like this,

65
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,530
we can't be friends anymore.

66
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,570
Please don't be angry.

67
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,930
Since I was missing my master too much,

68
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,170
I lost my senses for a moment

69
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,970
and mistakenly regarded
Young Master Wuji as my enemy.

70
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,370
Sorry for ruining everyone's mood.

71
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,730
I will take my leave now.

72
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,730
Am I smart?

73
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,730
I saved you.

74
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,490
Mi'er was acting strange today.

75
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,010
When I met her before,

76
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,330
she wasn't like that.

77
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,090
Don't you have anything
you want to ask me?

78
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,730
No, I trust you.

79
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,410
But Miss Lin just said

80
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,490
I killed her master.

81
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,970
I don't believe what others say.

82
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,610
I only believe what you say.

83
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,970
In the world,

84
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:50,810
besides you,

85
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,130
I have no other concerns.

86
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,010
Sir, Young Master Wuji
requests to see you.

87
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,450
Sir Li, the three days are up.

88
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,130
The files you promised to show me...

89
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:44,810
Sir.

90
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,650
Sir, Young Master Wuji
wants to talk to you.

91
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,730
Oh, no! Our master has been killed.

92
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,250
Help! Someone!

93
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,850
Miss,

94
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,850
you've drunk so much.

95
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,570
You can't find your way home, can you?

96
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,090
Young master, something happened!

97
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,530
Young master, something bad happened!

98
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:23,690
Say it.

99
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,530
Miss Tang didn't return last night.

100
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:26,610
You asked me to find her.

101
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:27,850
But as soon as I went out,

102
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,050
I saw Miss Tang...

103
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:43,090
Come to my house to stay for the night.

104
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:49,930
Move aside.

105
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,650
Who's it?

106
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,010
Young Master Wuji,

107
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,250
I'm sorry.

108
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:56,810
Move away.

109
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,250
Move away! Don't touch me!

110
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:58,970
All of you move away!

111
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,210
Don't touch me! Move away!

112
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,010
It's okay.

113
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,130
I just dreamt that I killed someone.

114
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,290
My hands were full of blood.

115
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,330
It's okay.

116
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,050
It's okay.

117
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,650
As long as I'm here,

118
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,650
it's okay.

119
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,850
Why am I here?

120
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,130
I remember I...

121
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,530
What happened?

122
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,090
Xiao Fang saw you

123
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,770
lying by the door when going out.

124
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:33,770
It's okay now.

125
00:09:36,682 --> 00:09:40,410
I can recall going shopping yesterday,

126
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,410
then...

127
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,650
I can't remember it.

128
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,690
Where's the stuff you bought?

129
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,050
My head really hurts at the moment.

130
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,050
I want to sleep for a while.

131
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,210
Young master,

132
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,290
here's the secret letter received today.

133
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,050
(See you at the Huafeng House tonight,
urgent matters.)

134
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,050
Come on in.

135
00:10:39,498 --> 00:10:43,626
(Huafeng House)

136
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,330
You're here, Young Master Wuji.

137
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:54,090
Come and see
if my lipstick is red enough.

138
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,450
Young Master Wuji.

139
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,170
Was he looking at me just now?

140
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,770
No, he was clearly looking at me.

141
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,730
How strange.

142
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,370
This house

143
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,530
is supposed to be a place where men come
to have some fun with the women,

144
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,570
yet all eyes are on you.

145
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,850
Compared to them,

146
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,130
I think

147
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,050
