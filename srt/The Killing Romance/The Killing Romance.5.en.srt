(Good Match, Deep Fondness)

15
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:09,250
Young master,

16
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,930
don't just water every flower you see.

17
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,010
You're watering lotus flowers.

18
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:15,650
And even lotus flowers

19
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,850
can't withstand your incessant watering.

20
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,450
You're anxious,
but you're still pretending not.

21
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:30,730
Young master,

22
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,450
if you're really worried,

23
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,730
go pick her up yourself.

24
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,410
She's usually quite clever.

25
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,930
Could such a grown person

26
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,490
really get lost?

27
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,170
What if Miss Tang is so sad

28
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,650
that she faints again?

29
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,130
What if she encounters someone

30
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,130
with bad intentions?

31
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,090
Young master, wait for me.

32
00:02:03,402 --> 00:02:08,554
(Because of You)

33
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,730
A good match is like the bright moon.

34
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,530
The water reflects my deep fondness.

35
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,050
Nice line.

36
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,690
How did you know this poem?

37
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,650
I don't know.

38
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,290
I just saw this Marriage Tree

39
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,170
and the moon,

40
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,770
and then I blurted it out.

41
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,170
I was shocked by myself.

42
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,850
Maybe I heard it somewhere before
and thought it was very good,

43
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:40,770
so I remembered it.

44
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,570
Young master, I hear

45
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,410
this Marriage Tree of Liyue City

46
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,930
only blooms once a year

47
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,170
and sometimes even not.

48
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,050
Is that true?

49
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,410
This tree has been rooted here
for 100 years.

50
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,250
It has its trait.

51
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,010
Only when it feels the most gratified

52
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,210
will it bloom.

53
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,250
Seasons are irrelevant.

54
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,450
Have you seen it bloom?

55
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,250
Miss Tang, you're finally back.

56
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,290
You made my master worried sick.

57
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,010
Would it kill you not to say it?

58
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,690
You were worried about me?

59
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,330
I'm hungry.

60
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,170
Xiao Fang, is there any wine?

61
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,050
Yes, I'll get it right away.

62
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,610
You're fond of drinking?

63
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,090
No,

64
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,570
but I want to drink today.

65
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,410
Have some.

66
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:51,890
It's up to you.

67
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,810
I'll leave you two.

68
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,570
It seems you're in a good mood today.

69
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,810
Because I made a new friend today.

70
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,810
A new friend? Who?

71
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,850
Greetings, Master.
I'm Imperial Guard, Lin Mi'er.

72
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,210
No, you've got the wrong person.

73
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,410
I'm not your master.

74
00:04:33,354 --> 00:04:34,490
I was abrupt.

75
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,650
You resemble my master so much,

76
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,250
so I...

77
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,330
Looking like me?

78
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,650
I'd really like to meet your master.

79
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,850
You'll never have the chance.

80
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,650
My master has long passed away.

81
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,370
Sorry, I don't know...

82
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,170
It's okay.

83
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,330
It's dangerous for you
to be alone by the river.

84
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,730
Thank you.

85
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,410
I'm Tang Xiaolu, and you?

86
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,010
Lin Mi'er.

87
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,410
Lin Mi'er.

88
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,890
I'll call you Mi'er.

89
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,530
Thank you for your help today.

90
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:07,850
May I invite you

91
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,610
to have tea and delicious pastries

92
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,610
in the house beside the Marriage Tree?

93
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,210
How can you be so careless

94
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,530
in making friends?

95
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,170
Do you think everyone is like you,

96
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,930
cautious and always on guard?

97
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,050
We hit it off.

98
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,170
It's not complicated.

99
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:48,650
Nice.

100
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:55,890
Miss Li,

101
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,130
when will you become my wife?

102
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,410
Don't talk nonsense.

103
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,850
Court matters are important.

104
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,730
It's not the time to talk about love.

105
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,690
Okay, I'll listen to you.

106
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:09,890
Good wine.

107
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:10,890
Young master,

108
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,930
don't let me drink alone.

109
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:13,970
Drink.

110
00:06:28,778 --> 00:06:32,682
(Because of You)

111
00:06:33,802 --> 00:06:35,130
Young Master Wuji,

112
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,050
you live up to your name.

113
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:41,090
Even with the curtain,
I am struck by your good looks.

114
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,850
Is your visit today to ask for a match

115
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,530
or to seek answers?

116
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,010
What if I tell you

117
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,330
I just came here for you?

118
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,170
This sheer curtain is needless.

119
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,850
Let me remove it.

120
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:02,650
It hurts.

121
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,770
But I like it.

122
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,450
If you're not here for a match,

123
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,570
please leave.

124
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,050
Okay.

125
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,290
I was just making a joke with you.

126
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,490
This paper contains the birth dates
of me and my future husband.

127
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,810
Please take a good look.

128
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,090
Should I proceed with this marriage?

129
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,330
Interesting.

130
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:25,810
Why?

131
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,890
Loneliness Sign, Widow Sign.

132
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,850
Born under any of these two

133
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,450
means there will be no marriage.

134
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,010
And you are endowed with both.

135
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,730
According to you,

136
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,170
I might as well shave my head
and go to a nunnery.

137
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,570
Since you said that
I would have no marriage,

138
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,490
why am I engaged?

139
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,530
You're doomed to be alone.

140
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,290
He is destined for good fortune.

141
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,170
In other words, only he in the world

142
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,650
can change your destiny.

143
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,090
It seems like

144
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,130
this marriage is inevitable.

145
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,810
You traveled a long way to be here.

146
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,650
You must have decided it.

147
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,210
You haven't even looked at me straight,

148
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,330
yet you knew I came from afar.

149
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,890
You use a face power
from Jinshan Country,

150
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,570
which is a concoction of nuts and musk.

151
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,890
It is rare here.

152
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,530
This power must be an aphrodisiac.

153
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,810
You're very knowledgeable.

154
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,170
Then please smell more.

155
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,130
Please respect yourself.

156
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:39,570
Do not

157
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:45,610
overstep it.

158
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,010
Young Master Wuji,

159
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,970
you will see me again.

160
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,490
Take care.

161
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:14,370
Xiao Fang.

162
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,050
Miss Tang,

163
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,050
for my master?

164
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,610
No, I am here for you.

165
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:20,650
For me?

166
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,850
(The time is a bit tight.)

167
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,530
(Now I can only hurry.)

168
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,690
(Young master, don't blame me, okay?)

169
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,330
It smells quite nice.

170
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,010
What's this new thing?

171
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,450
I haven't seen this before.

172
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,650
It can even be turned.

173
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,250
What...?

174
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,450
Isn't it

175
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,250
a killer...?

176
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,090
Who are you?

177
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:20,210

178
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,650

It's you.

182
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,610
Shh, don't talk.

183
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,410
