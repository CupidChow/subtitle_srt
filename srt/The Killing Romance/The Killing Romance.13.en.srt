are you sure this is the base

86
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,170
The Ghost Town is a lawless place.

87
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,610

are gathering here.

88
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,010

97
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,650

over and over again.

99
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,610
is big enough, right?

100
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,690
What? Didn't you say
it was exhilarating?

101
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,850
Why are you suddenly melancholic?

102
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,890
Recently, the empress
frequently summoned me to the palace

103
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,130
to discuss my marriage
with the princess of Jinshan.

104
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,410
What?

105
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,010
Are you unsatisfied
with marrying the princess of Jinshan?

106
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,290
Or is there someone in your heart?

107
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,410
Well,

108
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,530
I do have someone in my heart.

109
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,490
Master, when are you
planning to take action?

110
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,090
I called you over today

111
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,210
because I have thought it through.

112
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,650
To the people,

113
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,050
the former head of the Imperial Guards,
Li Ziyi, is already dead.

114
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,730
Now

115
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,850
I am struggling to live
with another identity,

116
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,570
and I have to spend every day
with the person who wronged me.

117
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,530
In this life,

118
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,530
I was forced to do many things.

119
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:17,810
Now

120
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,170
I want to leave

121
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,690
and live for myself.

122
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,450
Master,

123
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,330
isn't avenging for yourself

124
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,170
and killing that scoundrel

125
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,930
not living for yourself?

126
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,490
I am talking about

127
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,210
the self who has already died once

128
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,930
and doesn't care about love, justice,

129
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,930
gratitude, or grudges any more.

130
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,450
Mi'er, you used to stand
side by side with me.

131
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,370
Now

132
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,530
it's time for us to say goodbye.

133
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,490
I won't advise you on your future plans.

134
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,690
From today on,

135
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,170
we'll not see each other again.

136
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:57,450
Master,

137
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,570
if you wish
to let go of everything completely,

138
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,450
I will not stop you.

139
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,890

the vows we once pledged?

140

You all

141
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,450
shall give up your lives
for righteousness

142
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,250
and live up to His Majesty's grace.

143
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,890

149
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,690

then please

152

destroy this sword personally.

153
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,050
Only then will we give up completely

154
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:28,930
and

155
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,050
no longer follow you.
