(How Can A Dead Person Come Back to Life?)

15
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,296
(I wonder how long
you can keep this up.)

16
00:01:24,576 --> 00:01:26,576
Young Master Wuji,

17
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:31,776
why can't you like me a little more?

18
00:01:32,296 --> 00:01:34,856
(How can a dead person
come back to life?)

19
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,572
(Because of You)

20
00:01:57,696 --> 00:01:59,376
I wanted you to sit there.

21
00:02:10,376 --> 00:02:11,656
- What do you need from me?
- What do you need from me?

22
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:14,576
I'll speak first.

23
00:02:15,056 --> 00:02:15,856
Okay.

24
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:17,616
Since you are living here now,

25
00:02:17,616 --> 00:02:19,016
you have to follow my rules.

26
00:02:19,456 --> 00:02:20,736
What rules?

27
00:02:26,136 --> 00:02:27,016
First,

28
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:32,816
keep a distance of at least three feet
from me.

29
00:02:38,256 --> 00:02:42,696
Second,
do not enter my room without permission.

30
00:02:43,976 --> 00:02:46,336
It's not up to you.

31
00:02:48,696 --> 00:02:49,936
What is the third one?

32
00:02:51,176 --> 00:02:56,656
Don't lie to me.

33
00:02:57,456 --> 00:03:01,936
(Is he afraid that I will cheat him
of his wealth, body, and affection?)

34
00:03:03,536 --> 00:03:04,696
If you agree,

35
00:03:04,856 --> 00:03:06,016
sign here.

36
00:03:07,012 --> 00:03:10,308
(Three-point Covenant)

37
00:03:11,536 --> 00:03:12,336
Is it enough?

38
00:03:13,696 --> 00:03:15,776
Now it's my turn.

39
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:19,976
According to the rules
of the Tang family,

40
00:03:20,016 --> 00:03:22,256
tomorrow is the day I return there

41
00:03:22,616 --> 00:03:24,536
to see my parents.

42
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,896
You don't need to tell me

43
00:03:26,896 --> 00:03:28,216
what you do and where you go.

44
00:03:28,456 --> 00:03:31,056
Wait, you need to go back with me.

45
00:03:32,656 --> 00:03:33,256
I won't go.

46
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:34,096
Why?

47
00:03:34,856 --> 00:03:36,580
I told you that our marriage...

48
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,816
A nominal marriage without reality.

49
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,776
I see. Then I'll go back by myself.

50
00:03:42,336 --> 00:03:44,096
If there is nothing else,
I'll leave now.

51
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,736
Xiao Fang, prepare the water.
I'm going to take a bath.

52
00:04:26,256 --> 00:04:27,456
Why are you here?

53
00:04:30,056 --> 00:04:31,856
To take a bath. What else?

54
00:04:35,096 --> 00:04:37,776
The sunlight is perfect,
and the water temperature is just right.

55
00:04:38,136 --> 00:04:39,216
I should enjoy it.

56
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:42,296
Get out.

57
00:04:43,536 --> 00:04:44,484
Why should I?

58
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,016
You take your bath, and I'll take mine.

59
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:47,576
We won't interfere with each other.

60
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,776
It's not against your rules.

61
00:04:50,856 --> 00:04:52,896
It's definitely
more than three feet now.

62
00:04:54,056 --> 00:04:55,416
(I wonder what you can do about me.)

63
00:04:55,936 --> 00:04:57,176
If you're taking a bath,

64
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:58,856
why are you still dressed?

65
00:04:58,976 --> 00:05:00,616
I like it this way. Isn't that okay?

66
00:05:00,616 --> 00:05:01,776
Aren't you dressed too?

67
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:04,296
If you won't take them off,

68
00:05:04,656 --> 00:05:05,936
I'll give you a hand.

69
00:05:07,216 --> 00:05:08,376
Wuji, don't come closer.

70
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:10,656
Don't you think I won't dare...

71
00:05:12,016 --> 00:05:13,616
Don't come any closer. You...

72
00:05:13,776 --> 00:05:14,576
Young master?

73
00:05:15,776 --> 00:05:16,776
Young master.

74
00:05:26,976 --> 00:05:28,136
Just stand there.

75
00:05:29,016 --> 00:05:31,616
Young master, I've investigated
as you said.

76
00:05:31,656 --> 00:05:34,096
The Tang family in the east of the city
does have a daughter.

77
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:34,976
Her name is Tang Xiaolu.

78
00:05:35,176 --> 00:05:36,856
She is the one who married you.

79
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:39,656
The Tang family runs a cloth business.

80
00:05:39,656 --> 00:05:40,536
They are well-known.

81
00:05:40,536 --> 00:05:41,656
Everyone knows about them.

82
00:05:42,256 --> 00:05:44,136
Okay, I got it. You may leave now.

83
00:05:44,576 --> 00:05:46,016
Alright, I'm leaving.

84
00:05:57,776 --> 00:05:59,976
Wuji, I will kill you.

85
00:06:00,336 --> 00:06:01,816
I'm done. Suit yourself.

86
00:06:03,616 --> 00:06:05,816
Are you so afraid that others
might see us together?

87
00:06:06,736 --> 00:06:08,336
I don't allow my woman

88
00:06:08,336 --> 00:06:10,296
to be seen by others
in this kind of situation.

89
00:06:13,736 --> 00:06:15,616
(Did he mean)

90
00:06:16,096 --> 00:06:19,176
(I am his woman?)

91
00:06:23,056 --> 00:06:24,856
Which bride would go back home
by herself?

92
00:06:25,456 --> 00:06:26,656
My parents would scold me.

93
00:06:27,336 --> 00:06:29,456
Now I've really become a joke.

94
00:06:29,576 --> 00:06:30,896
So annoying.

95
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:31,976
It's all Wuji's fault.

96
00:06:32,176 --> 00:06:34,776
He's heartless, ruthless, and selfish.

97
00:06:42,776 --> 00:06:45,416
Didn't you say you wouldn't come?

98
00:06:45,456 --> 00:06:46,616
You're worried about me?

99
00:06:47,256 --> 00:06:49,056
Stop the nonsense, and let's go.

100
00:06:54,696 --> 00:06:56,456
Since you're here,

101
00:06:56,576 --> 00:06:58,416
do me another favor.

102
00:06:59,256 --> 00:07:01,576
Father, Mother, we're home.

104
00:07:08,456 --> 00:07:10,096
They should be at home.

105
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:16,736
Ying'er.

106
00:07:17,376 --> 00:07:19,336
This is Ying'er,
my former personal maid.

107
00:07:19,496 --> 00:07:20,976
Ying'er, where are my parents?

108

109
00:07:49,576 --> 00:07:50,376
Ying'er?

Ying'er?

111
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:58,696
This is strange.

112
00:07:59,336 --> 00:08:01,896
Usually, my mother
likes it bright in the house.

113
00:08:02,456 --> 00:08:04,576
Why is it so dark everywhere today?

114
00:08:06,096 --> 00:08:09,336
Father, Mother, I'm back.

115
00:08:10,696 --> 00:08:11,496
Father?

116
00:08:12,456 --> 00:08:13,256
