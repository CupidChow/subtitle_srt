you can't enter my room?

16
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,530
Please let me explain.

17
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:15,770
Well,

18
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,530
I didn't mean to.

19
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,210
I really don't know why it...

20
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,130
It's...

21
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,650
It's the bird.

22
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,410
It's just a bird.

23
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,450
Why does it speak human language
instead of bird language?

24
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,450
It scared me.

25
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,530
I didn't realize what I bumped into.

26
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,690
Then the closet opened.

27
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,250
Get out of my sight now.

28
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:55,850

31
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,010
Just a piece of clothing.

32
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,410
Who wants to enter your room anyway?

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,410
What?

34
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,650
Are there any treasures in the room

35
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:16,690
that you're afraid I'd steal?

36
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,770
T-T-Treasures.

37
00:02:25,866 --> 00:02:28,490
Those weapons.

38
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:30,530
So

39
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,890
could it be that he disguises himself
as a matchmaker in the day

40
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,450
and kills people at night?

41
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:14,490
No.

42
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:15,930
It can't be.

43
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:16,490
It can't be.

44
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:16,890
Impossible.

45
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:17,570
It can't be true.

46
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,090
Is our trust

47
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,970
so fragile?

48
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,210
It is his freedom to do
whatever he wants.

49
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,330
As for me, I'll adapt to whatever comes.

50
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,530
Right.

51
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,450
I should get back to handle this first.

52
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:35,530
Alas,

53
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,930
Yuan is more obedient.

54
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:41,490
Yuan.

55
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,890
See how good it is.

56
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,210
Young master,

57
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,650
you really misunderstood Miss Tang.

58
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,010
She broke the promise and entered
my room without permission.

59
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,530
And she opened my secret closet.

60
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,530
Oh, and she also took one of my clothes.

61
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,010
Why did she take away my clothes?

62
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,610
What do you need, Miss Tang?

63
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:17,730
Xiao Fang,

64
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,610
can you tell me
Young Master Wuji's birthday?

65
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,130
You're not going to get

66
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,970
your compatibility calculated
by zodiacs too, are you?

67
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,090
No.

68
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,570
I stay here, well-fed and well-pampered.

69
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,090
I want to do whatever I can for him.

70
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,690
You know,

71
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,410
I don't have much money now,

72
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,890
but I can make clothes.

73
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,650
I want to make a nice outfit

74
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,090
for him on his birthday.

75
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,250
Sounds good.

76
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,970
You snapped at her.

77
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,130
It's all your fault.

78
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,290
Why didn't you tell me?

79
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,730
You didn't ask.

80
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,970
Have a look at the new fabrics.

81
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,850
Just have a look.

82
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,690
Take a look.

83
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,850
Sir, how much is this fabric?

84
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,090
You're discerning.

85
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,330
This is the only piece
of brocade I have.

86
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,730
How about ten taels of silver?

87
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,290
I…

88
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,130
I only have this much. Is it enough?

89
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,850
Are you teasing me?

90
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,130

92
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:45,930
Well,

93
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,130

who was so generous.
