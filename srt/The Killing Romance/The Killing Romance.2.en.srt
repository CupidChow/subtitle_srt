(So What if Love Is Not Mutual?)

15
00:02:07,176 --> 00:02:09,152
(Because of You)

16
00:02:09,152 --> 00:02:10,792
Young master,
we've already closed for the day.

17
00:02:10,792 --> 00:02:11,952
If you're here to seek marriage,

18
00:02:11,952 --> 00:02:12,832
please come back tomorrow.

19
00:02:20,412 --> 00:02:21,852
Since you're seeking marriage,

20
00:02:21,852 --> 00:02:23,652
there's no better day than today.

21
00:02:24,652 --> 00:02:26,012
Please come inside, young master.

22
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:30,132
Young master!

23
00:02:36,306 --> 00:02:38,506
What kind of marriage are you seeking today?

24
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:42,259
I'm seeking you.

25
00:03:00,655 --> 00:03:02,319
Fa Wuwei of the Dragon Guardians.

26
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:05,719
Your Highness.

27
00:03:06,649 --> 00:03:08,049
Long time no see.

28
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:11,609
It's been three years,

29
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:12,441
Fa Wuwei.

30
00:03:12,537 --> 00:03:16,169
(Xiao Shi, the Crown Prince)
No, I should call you Young Master Wuji.

31
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:18,449
Three years ago,

32
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:20,649
I was secretly sent out of the palace,

33
00:03:21,929 --> 00:03:23,409
which saved me from death.

34
00:03:24,529 --> 00:03:26,249
For three years,
I've been living under a false name,

35
00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:28,969
all in hopes of one day

36
00:03:29,369 --> 00:03:31,569
avenging the Dragon Guardians
and restoring our reputation.

37
00:03:33,649 --> 00:03:34,969
Though I am the Crown Prince,

38
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:36,609
in the eyes of the empress,

39
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:38,849
I am nothing
but a pawn to be manipulated.

40
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:41,009
Since the incident that day,

41
00:03:41,529 --> 00:03:43,809
she has used the excuse
that my father needs rest

42
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:46,049
to forbid anyone in the court
from seeing him.

43
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:49,489
Now the empress alone has the say.

44
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:51,569
There is no one
I can trust in the court.

45
00:03:51,929 --> 00:03:53,649
I feel like I'm walking on thin ice.

46
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:56,489
You came here today,

47
00:03:56,929 --> 00:03:58,129
which means you trust me and believe

48
00:03:58,369 --> 00:04:00,969
the Dragon Guardians had nothing to do
with the assassination back then.

49
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:06,889
In that case,

50
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:08,769
just tell me what you want.

51
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:11,969
In recent years, strange things
have been happening constantly.

52
00:04:12,649 --> 00:04:14,329
The loyal officials
who used to serve my father

53
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:15,449
either died of unknown reasons

54
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:17,049
or are acting crazily.

55
00:04:17,809 --> 00:04:20,489
The rest keep their mouths shut

56
00:04:20,825 --> 00:04:22,569
and no longer care about court affairs.

57
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:26,609
I came here today,

58
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:28,769
hoping you can find evidence,

59
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:30,209
uncover the truth,

60
00:04:30,809 --> 00:04:33,569
and expose the person behind all this
to the world.

61
00:04:35,489 --> 00:04:37,049
As for the person behind all this,

62
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:39,969
I believe you already have an answer
in your mind.

63
00:04:41,945 --> 00:04:43,009
Heed my order, Fa Wuwei.

64
00:04:47,489 --> 00:04:48,569
(Dragon Guardians)
From now on,

65
00:04:48,769 --> 00:04:50,209
you will resume your role
as a secret agent

66
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:56,009
and help me reclaim the throne.

67
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:09,931
Young master, this is the calming tea.

68
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:10,971
You should drink it first.

69
00:05:16,051 --> 00:05:16,931
Xiao Fang.

70
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:19,291
Do you think there are really

71
00:05:20,811 --> 00:05:22,691
people who are exactly alike
in this world?

72
00:05:22,731 --> 00:05:23,611
Of course, there are.

73
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:25,771
Like twins.

74
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,251
Though they might not be

75
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:30,227
exactly the same from head to toe,

76
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,691
outsiders usually can't tell them apart.

77
00:05:32,691 --> 00:05:34,291
(Twins?)

78
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:34,931
Young master,

79
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:37,611
based on the rules, you have to marry me
since you removed my mask.

80
00:05:41,251 --> 00:05:43,891
By the way, I will send
the wedding suit to your house.

81
00:05:43,891 --> 00:05:46,091
You don't need to prepare anything.
Just wait to marry me.

82
00:05:50,091 --> 00:05:52,211
Are you really going to marry her?

83
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:53,731
So, young master,

84
00:05:54,211 --> 00:05:57,371
will you wear this wedding suit or not?

85
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:00,531
I'll throw it away now.

86
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:02,371
Hold on.

87
00:06:13,075 --> 00:06:14,491
This is such fine fabric.

88
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:16,611
If I don't wear it,

89
00:06:17,171 --> 00:06:18,291
it would be a waste.

90
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,279
Such a fanfare.

91
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,719
What if he refuses to let me in?

92
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,559
Then the Tang family will be disgraced.

93
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,799
No.

94
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,719
The day we're going to get married was in plain sight.

95
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,479
He had his arm around me.

96
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,799
He took my mask off with one hand.

97
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,319
Isn't that what it means to be in love?

98
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,319
I'm from a family with a lot of money.

99
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,519
With my looks.

100
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,719
My personality.

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,679
There's no reason for him to refuse.

102
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,159
God, Tang Xiao Lu.

103
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,559
Be confident.

104
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,519
But what if when he sees me

105
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,719
there wasn't a trace of joy on his face.

106
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,959
It's going feel as cold as an ice.

107
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,359
It's like seeing something ominous.

108
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,319
Oops.

109
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,079
It's a pain in the ass.

110
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,839
I don't care.

111
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,039
Let's see what we can do.

112
00:07:14,531 --> 00:07:16,011
Miss, we're here.

113
00:07:18,131 --> 00:07:20,291
Light the firecrackers.

114
00:07:36,131 --> 00:07:38,251
Why hasn't Young Master Wuji
come out to meet her?

115
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:39,371
Right.

116
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:41,771
Why is it so lively?

117
00:07:43,851 --> 00:07:44,931
Don't you know etiquette?

118
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,851
Our lady is here.
Where is your young master?

119
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:48,451
(Because of You)
You are the one who knows no etiquette.

120
00:07:48,451 --> 00:07:49,331
It's so early now.

121
00:08:05,262 --> 00:08:06,462
There he is.

122
00:08:06,702 --> 00:08:07,342
Step out.

123
00:08:07,342 --> 00:08:08,702
So handsome.

124
00:08:08,742 --> 00:08:09,942
She's getting out.

125
00:08:20,022 --> 00:08:22,222
(So he does have me in his heart.)

126
00:08:41,582 --> 00:08:43,862
Young Master Wuji
really kept his promise

127
00:08:43,862 --> 00:08:45,502
and married the one
whose mask was removed by him.

128
00:08:46,422 --> 00:08:47,222
Congratulations!

129
00:09:04,742 --> 00:09:05,982
Miss, we will leave now.

130
00:09:10,518 --> 00:09:11,662
Young master,

131
00:09:12,342 --> 00:09:16,742
isn't it time for us
to worship heaven and earth?

132
00:09:23,342 --> 00:09:24,542
It's okay if we don't.

133
00:09:24,582 --> 00:09:26,662
After all, I don't like formalities.

134
00:09:26,702 --> 00:09:27,742
We can keep things simple.

135
00:09:28,118 --> 00:09:30,982
Then, young master, should we...

136
00:09:30,982 --> 00:09:33,582
Miss, the hand you are holding is mine.

137
00:09:38,422 --> 00:09:39,222
What?

138
00:09:40,342 --> 00:09:42,422
How could he leave me here
just after leading me into the door?

139
00:09:42,422 --> 00:09:43,582
What is going on?

140
00:09:43,662 --> 00:09:44,982
Where is your young master?

141
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,302
Wuji!

142
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,502
(He's still in his wedding suit.)

143
00:09:59,094 --> 00:10:01,662
(I knew he had feelings for me.)

144
00:10:01,862 --> 00:10:03,382
Why are you doing this?

145
00:10:03,382 --> 00:10:04,862
Based on the rules
of the Marital Festival,

146
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,502
I accept that I removed your mask
and we got engaged.

147
00:10:07,638 --> 00:10:10,166
Although you set the wedding date
without discussing it with me,

148
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,342
I married you formally anyway.

149
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:13,262
But...

150
00:10:13,262 --> 00:10:14,142
But,

151
00:10:16,422 --> 00:10:17,782
I have no feelings for you.

152
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,102
In other words,

153
00:10:19,102 --> 00:10:20,782
out of consideration
for both of our reputations,

154
00:10:21,022 --> 00:10:23,302
this marriage will be one
about husband-and-wife etiquette

155
00:10:23,942 --> 00:10:25,142
without reality.

156
00:10:25,862 --> 00:10:28,118
(A marriage without reality?)

157
00:10:28,118 --> 00:10:30,454
I told Xiao Fang
to prepare the side room.

158
00:10:30,454 --> 00:10:31,942
You will live there from now on.

159
00:10:31,942 --> 00:10:34,342
I don't want to.
It's no different than a fake marriage.

160
00:10:34,742 --> 00:10:36,862
I don't want a marriage like this.

161
00:10:46,198 --> 00:10:47,862
The best man in the whole city?

162
00:10:47,862 --> 00:10:50,102
He is just a stone in the latrine,
stinky and hard.

163
00:10:50,422 --> 00:10:52,222
I was blind.

164
00:10:52,222 --> 00:10:54,462
I actually thought he would treat me
as he does in my dreams.

165
00:10:54,622 --> 00:10:55,742
I must be out of my mind.

166
00:10:58,582 --> 00:10:59,582
Stop.

167
00:11:00,142 --> 00:11:01,902
You came here with a lot of fanfare.

168
00:11:02,222 --> 00:11:03,302
Have you ever thought about

169
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:05,542
who will be embarrassed
if you go back like this?

170
00:11:11,574 --> 00:11:12,942
Who says I'm going back?

171
00:11:13,142 --> 00:11:15,302
I just want to see if all my dowries

172
00:11:15,302 --> 00:11:17,182
were all moved in
without leaving a single one.

173
00:11:17,422 --> 00:11:19,182
You were so eager to marry me.

174
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,022
What's your purpose? Tell me.

175
00:11:21,366 --> 00:11:23,182
(If I directly tell him)

176
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,222
(that the person in my dream and he
are exactly the same,)

177
00:11:25,334 --> 00:11:26,342
(will I be considered)

178
00:11:26,342 --> 00:11:28,662
(like those women who adore him?)

179
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:30,862
(No, that's so embarrassing.)

180
00:11:32,462 --> 00:11:34,502
Do I need a reason to like someone?

181
00:11:35,902 --> 00:11:37,822
