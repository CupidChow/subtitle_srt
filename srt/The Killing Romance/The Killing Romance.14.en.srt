Young master,

27
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:47,770
Madam is missing.

28
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,450
What?

29
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,050
We've searched everywhere
in the teahouse and at home,

30
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,170
but there's no trace of her.

31
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,450
I told her yesterday.

32
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,610
Why is she

33
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,490
(Marriage)
missing now?

34
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,530
Tonight is the banquet.

35
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,330
Welcome here,

36
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,530
all couples.

37
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,890
Please make yourselves at home

38
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,410
and enjoy the good food and drink

39
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,410
together today.

40
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:16,690
Please.

41
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:17,650
Young master,

42
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,610
why isn't your wife here yet?

43
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,210
Yes.

44
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,410
We are looking forward to

45
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,730
joyously drinking with you two.

46
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,090
Yes.

47
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,450
It's the Double Seventh Festival.

48
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,290
We are in pairs,

49
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,210
but you are alone.

50
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,610
How can we

51
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,050
do it?

52
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,410
Please invite Madam Wuji.

53
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,610
Everyone, calm down.

54
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,490
Calm down.

55
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,050
Madam is taking longer
for makeup and dress-up,

56
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,410
so there's been a slight delay.

57
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,610
Enjoy your meal and drink.

58
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,130
She will be here soon.

59
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,210
She will be here soon.

60
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,130
Madam.

61
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,690
Li Ziyi,

62
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,170
you're back.

63
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,890
Murder!

64
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,010
I'm here to take
the life of the unfaithful.

65
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:37,770
I just knew it.

66
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,450
Our master wouldn't let us down.

67
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,050
When did you find out about my identity?

68
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,130
You mean,

69
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,450
the daughter of Tang family

70
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,330
or General Li of the Imperial Guards?

71
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,210
You're asking knowingly.

72
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:57,690
Do you know

73
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,890
I've doubted you from the start?

74
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,690
You didn't die?

75
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,690
Do you know how much

76
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,210
I've longed for you
to acknowledge your identity,

77
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,010
and to acknowledge you're still alive,

78
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,130
when I look at your face,

79
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,690
even if it means
believing in resurrection?

80
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,450
But you didn't.

81
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,170
Then fine,

82
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,970
I'd force you to.

83
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:34,810
If you won't take them off,

84
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,130
I'll give you a hand.

85
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:38,890
Wuji, don't come closer.

86
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,490
Don't you think I won't dare...

87
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,010
Are you so afraid that others
might see us together?

88
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,730
I don't allow my woman

89
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,650
to be seen by others
in this kind of situation.

90
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:53,850
Li Ziyi,

91
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,210
you think you can hide it from me?

92
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,450
A good match is like the bright moon.

93
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,210
The water reflects my deep fondness.

94
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,370
That poem was written for you.

95
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,330
No one else knows.

96
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,930
At the Court of Judicial Review,

97
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:20,970
you got poisoned during a fight.

98
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,330
I got you.

99
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,650
Since you've recognized me long before,

100
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,210
why didn't you kill me?

101
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,610
Just like three years ago.

102
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,970
You let down the emperor and me.

103
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,890
What you gave me in return

104
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,290
for all those years
of friendship was but a shot.

105
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,450
I've never betrayed you.

106
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,530
You're lying.

107
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,650
A step further,

108
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,170
and I will kill you.

109
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,090
If I'm such a heartless man
in your heart,

110
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,330
then what's the harm in me dying?

111
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,010
A good match is like the bright moon.

112
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,770
The water reflects my deep fondness.

113
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,290
Why can't you just believe me?

114
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,250
How am I supposed to believe you?

115
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,690
How are you going to explain
everything I saw that year?

116
00:06:35,274 --> 00:06:37,386
(3 years ago)

117
00:06:37,386 --> 00:06:40,426
(South Gate of the Palace)

118
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:41,970
Sir.

119
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:43,730
Your Majesty.

120
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,930
You were summoned here

121
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,290
because His Majesty has been having
trouble sleeping recently

122
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,370
with occasional nightmares.

123
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,490
His Majesty is going to pray to Buddha
for peace of mind.

124
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,890
You're ordered to protect His Majesty.

125
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,090
There must not be any mistakes.

126
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,490
Yes.

127
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,370
May I know

128
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,130
why His Majesty wants
to set out at this hour?

129
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:04,930
How dare you!

130
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,690
His Majesty's intentions

131
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,490
are not something that we can guess.

132
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,330
I wouldn't dare.

133
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,410
Get it up.
