I'm honored

16
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,490
to have you hunt

17
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,730
together with me.

18
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,090
Uncle, you are too courteous.

19
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,010
The day after tomorrow
is Mother's birthday.

20
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,090
I was deliberating over
what gift to present.

21
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,130
If I manage to hunt game
today to give to her,

22
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,010
she would surely be delighted.

23
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:32,410
Speaking of which,

24
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,810
my archery skills were taught by you.

25
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:36,530
Well,

26
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,090
let's have a competition today.

27
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,010
(They're too close to me.)

28
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:29,730
(I have to use a knife.)

29
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,330
It's Prince Chu.

30
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,330
Oh, no. It's a trap!

31
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,810
Li Ziyi is not dead.

32
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,090
She posed a fearless look

33
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,890
when standing in front of me today.

34
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,210
What?

35
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,890
Wanna kill me?

36
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,130
No.

37
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,090
I won't change.

38
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,810
No one can take away

39
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,170
everything I have.

40
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,410
Lanying.

41
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,450
Hurry.

42
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,570
Hurry up.

43
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:52,890
Don't worry.

44
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,450
After your birthday celebration,

45
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,890
we'll have no concerns.

46
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,330
What happened?

47
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:28,730
Who is there?

48
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,210
So, you mean,

49
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,690
His Majesty is being manipulated?

50
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,130
Just like

51
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:05,650
Ying'er

52
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,170
who was suddenly like
a different person.

53
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,370
It's bad.

54
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:11,930
The empress must have a person

55
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,090
who knows about witchcraft.

56
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,370
I have to find a way

57
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,410
into the palace tomorrow.

58
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,410
In their eyes,

59
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,730
you are already a criminal.

60
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:22,970
Your appearance

61
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,290
would possibly be used as a pretext

62
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,570
to kill the Crown Prince.

63
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,850
As for me,
I have already entered the palace.

64
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,930
Though I'm not
an Imperial Guard anymore,

65
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,370
I have the Crown Prince's protection.

66
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,930
I can move around in the palace.

67
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,250
But...

68
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,490
But this time, it's different.

69
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,930
You don't know what you're up against.

70
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,050
Did you forget?

71
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,650
I always kill those

72
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:44,610
who stand in my way,

73
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,690
whether it's a mortal or a god.

74
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,050
This time,

75
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,530
I will personally put an end to my past.

76
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,370
Just trust me.

77
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,490
After I return,

78
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,530
we'll live a stable life

79
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,490
and enjoy peace.

80
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,370
Okay.

81
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,010
I got it.

82
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:08,490
But

83
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,330
where there's light,

84
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,090
there are

85
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:15,810
shadows.

for a long life

92
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,210
and endless fortune.

93
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,490
No need for courtesy.

94
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,010
Please take your seats.

95
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,130
Mother,

96
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:34,930
a few days ago,

97
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,690
I went hunting with my uncle

98
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,570
to catch game
as a birthday gift for you.

99
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,370
But it was my incompetence.

100
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:42,730
Who could have thought

101
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,490
that the game we had cornered

102
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,970
would escape?

103
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,530
It's alright.

104
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,090
You care about me,

105
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,810
and that is the greatest gift to me.

106
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:53,850
But that's not enough.

107
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:54,770
Mother,

108
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,690
I still have a gift for you.

109
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,610
I'm Li Ziyi.

110
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,690
I wish Your Majesty health, long life,

111
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,050
fame and fortune.

112
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,010
Today, at the invitation
of the Crown Prince,

113
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,410
I have come to present a sword dance.

114
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:34,210
It's a birthday gift

115
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,330
and also a farewell gift.

116
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:38,530
I've heard you're skilled in combat.

117
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,730
But I didn't know

118
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,930
you're also good at dance.

119
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,410
Okay.

120
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,490
Let me see what you've got.

121
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,410
Your Majesty.

122
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,010
This stab

123
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,170
is for His Majesty.

124

125
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,290
is for my brother.

This stab

127
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,170
is for Wuji.

128
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:45,410
How dare you

129
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,450
do such a presumptuous thing
in the palace!

130
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,330
Guards!

131
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,890
Arrest her!

00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,530
Who would dare?

133
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,810
The Tiger Tally is here.

134
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,010
It's as if His Majesty is here.

135
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:01,810
All back away.

136

00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,170
do not make another mistake.
