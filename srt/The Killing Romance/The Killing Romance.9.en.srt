When will you stop pretending?

00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:03,850
Huh?

17
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:06,450
I'm asking you.

Am I seeing this right?

00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,090
The young master
is actually carrying Miss Tang in arms.

56
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,410
Why do you still call her Miss Tang?

57
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,610
You should call her Madam.

58
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,290
Do you want more?

59
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,570
(Miss Tang is really awesome.)

60
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,650
(Good playing of hard-to-get.)

61
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,250
(She nailed it.)

62
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,210
(The young master
has seized the chance.)

63
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,130
(He is so smart.)

64
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,730
(It's so touching.)

65
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,010
(Finally, the young master
has gotten the hang of it.)

66
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,330
(Who is crying?)

67
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,690
(It's such a sweet moment.)

68
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,130
(Why are you crying?)

69
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,490
(I'm really envious of Miss Tang.)

70
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,410
Listen up.

71
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,450
From today on,

72
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,490
Miss Tang will be
the hostess of this mansion.

73
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,010
That is, she's my wife.

74
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,650
She hasn't been feeling well lately,

75
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,210
so I will take care of her closely.

76
00:04:59,818 --> 00:05:01,610
You guys should be ready at all times.

77
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,850
- Yes, young master.
- Yes, young master.

78
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,690
Alright, you can go now.

79
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,650
How can you make decisions without...

80
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,050
I never consult anyone when I do things.

81
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,042
Mr. Lin, what brings you here?

82
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,810
Given your look,
you must have some good news.

83
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,330
There are two reasons
for my visit today.

84
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,330
One is to thank Young Master Wuji
for being my son's matchmaker,

85
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,130
and the second is
to personally invite Young Master Wuji

86
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,410
to attend my grandson's
one-hundred-day celebration.

87
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,090
You're too kind.

88
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,250
Please come in, Mr. Lin.

89
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,410
Young master, look who's here.

90
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,450
This year is full of joy.

91
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,770
A noble child is born into your family.

92
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,090
Congratulations, Mr. Lin.

93
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,810
Thank you, Young Master Wuji.

94
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,570
My son's happiness today
is largely due to you.

95
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,810
You are the benefactor of our family.

96
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,610
We look forward to your presence.

97
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,370
You must be there.

98
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:29,810
I will.

99
00:06:33,194 --> 00:06:34,770
Mr. Lin, it's good that you came today.

100
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,730
I have a question I'd like to ask you.

101
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,170
There's no need to be formal.

102
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,050
Young Master Wuji, please go ahead.

103
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,730
My wife has been feeling unwell lately.

104
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,530
But her symptoms are very strange.

105
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:45,770
She's weak all over.

106
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,810
There are some blue spots on her neck.

107
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,890
I wonder what disease
she has contracted.

108
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,930
I'm afraid it's not a disease.

109
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,570
But rather, she's been poisoned.

110
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,330
You may not know

111
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,810
that the poison of Jinshan
is unparalleled in the world.

112
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,530
According to your description,

113
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,690
your wife only has blue spots
on her neck,

114
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,290
so the poison should not be severe.

115
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:11,290
Once the residual poison is removed,
she'll recover like a normal person.

116
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,930
When I get back,
I'll prepare some medicine for you.

117
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,170
Combine it with Ginkgo leaves
to brew water,

118
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,090
and take a bath in it for six hours.

119
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,890
Is there anything else
we need to pay attention to?

120
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,130
Rest more,

121
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,490
and she can recover.

122
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:24,890
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

123
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,130
Xiao Fang, see Mr. Lin out.

124
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:27,850
Yes.

125
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,650
Mr. Lin, this way, please.

126
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,890
Why are you looking at me like that?

127
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:18,570
What?

128
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,290
Can't I even look at my own wife?

129
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,210
Do you remember the agreement
we made before?

130
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,970
The agreement?

131
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,290
Does it still count?

132
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,890
You've already called me your wife.

133
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,610
First,

134
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,850
you broke into my room.

135
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:43,730
Second,

136
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,330
you got close to me.

137
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:47,570
You broke

138
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,650
two rules a long time ago.

139
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,210
What about the third one?

140
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,370
The third one is

141
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,770
that I can never lie to you.

142
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,210
I believe

143
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,210
you have never lied to me.

144
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,570
Young master, something's wrong.

145
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,210
It seems like
there's a fire at the door.

146
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,090
A fire?

147
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,570
Come in.

148
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,370
Master, I am late.

149
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:50,650
Forgive me for being slow.

150
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,650
Did you cause the fire at the door?

151
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,650
Don't worry, Master.

152
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,850
I just lit the lantern
hanging outside the door.

153
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:57,970
It won't cause much trouble.

154
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,730
Master, I missed you a lot.

155
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,210
What happened to you back then?

156
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,970
When I woke up three years ago,

157
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,050
I lost all my memories.

158
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,930
I really thought
that I was the daughter of Tang family.

159
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,410
They treated me with a lot of affection.

160
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,290
So I accepted this identity
and moved on.

161
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:20,930
However,

162
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:24,530
some images kept emerging in my mind.

163
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,210
I didn't pay attention at the time.

164
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,290
Now that I've regained my memory,
I've realized

165
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,370
that those images

166
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,090
are what I truly experienced
in the past.

167
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,610
When did you regain your memory?

168
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,970
