(Old Friends Reunite)

15
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,570
Greetings, Mother.

16
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,810
May you be in perfect health.

17
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,250
Please rise.

18
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,210
Thank you, Mother.

19
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:09,890
You lost some weight
after going out of the palace

20
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,250
for a few days.

21
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,930
Even your skin is much darker.

22
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:15,650
Presumably,

23
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:16,850
the incognito journey

24
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,890
wasn't as comfortable
as your time inside the palace.

25
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,890
You must have suffered a lot.

26
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,290
Thank you for your concern, Mother.

27
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:24,770
Although the things

28
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,370
in the city

29
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,610
are not as good as in the palace,

30
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,090
there's much variety.

31
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,970
They look fresh.

32
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,450
If it wasn't for missing you,

33
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:36,610
I would like to stay
in the city for a few more days.

34
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,090
You seem to have a knack
for enjoying yourself.

35
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,690
The memorials to the throne

36
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,490
are nearly stacked
into a small mountain.

37
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,930
It is my incompetence

38
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:45,930
in not helping you

39
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,530
with the tedious government affairs.

40
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,090
But

41
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,450
it's your personal efforts

42
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,810
that bring the country

43
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:54,810
peace and prosperity.

44
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,730
What have you seen and heard

45
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,050
on this incognito trip?

46
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,810
Share it with me.

47
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,890
To be honest,

48
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:02,730
I encountered

49
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,170
dangers.

50
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,450
Fortunately, an old friend
came to the rescue,

51
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:09,570
so I escaped from the danger.

52
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:10,970
Look,

53
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,690
didn't I come back safe and sound?

54
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,330
What were your servants doing?

55
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,530
Couldn't they even protect you
in such a small place?

56
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,370
Let's change them all later.

57
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,570
Please don't be angry.

58
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,330
It was all because of my carelessness.

59
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,090
It actually was quite a coincidence.

60
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,610
If it hadn't been for the danger,

61
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,490
I

62
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,930
wouldn't have encountered an old friend
whom I hadn't seen for years.

63
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,090
An old friend?

64
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,610
That person used to be in the palace?

65
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,410
That's right.

66
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,770
Have I seen that person?

67
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,250
Yes, Mother.

68
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,690
She is waiting outside the palace now.

69
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,930
Why not summon her in?

70
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,090
I want to thank her in person.

71
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,690
I'm Li Ziyi.

72
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,770
Greetings, Your Majesty.

73
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,210
May you be in good health.

74
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,650
Wasn't General Li...?

75
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,610
Mother,

76
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,890
if I hadn't seen her with my own eyes,

77
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,410
I'd have thought

78
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,010
General Li was dead.

79
00:03:36,746 --> 00:03:39,130
Back then, I was seriously injured,

80
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,730
but it did not hurt my vitals.

81
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,490
By some coincidence,

82
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,130
I was rescued
by a civilian after drowning.

83
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,010
Then I lost my memory

84
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,090
and wandered around.

85
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,370
After gradually recovering my memory,

86
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,250
I was fortunate
to reunite with His Highness

87
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,330
and thus returned to the palace.

88
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,970
Very good.

89
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,330
You're blessed by God

90
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,010
and lucky to be alive.

91
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,210
Back then, you gave your life
to protect His Majesty.

92
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:07,570
There should be a reward.

93
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,490
But you might know that

94
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,090
things have changed.

95
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,850
His Majesty has been unconscious
due to illness and has never woken up.

96
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,170
The Imperial Guards have long been...

97
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,210
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

98
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,130
I came to Your Majesty today

99
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,050
not to claim merit or resume office

100
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,610
but to plead guilty
in front of His Majesty.

101
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,530
To plead guilty?

102
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,210
What are you guilty of?

103
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,930
I was blind

104
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,210
and couldn't

105
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,290
tell good from evil.

106
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,250
As the leader of the Imperial Guards,

107
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,890
I failed to notice the wild ambition
of the Dragon Guardians.

108
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,730
I was fortunate not to die.

109
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,770
My return to the palace

110
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,410
is only to kneel
before His Majesty in person

111
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,530
to express my repentance.

112
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:51,530
I hope

113
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,250
you will fulfill my request.

114
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,210
His Majesty is critically ill
and should not be disturbed.

115
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,850
Even the Crown Prince
isn't allowed to visit him.

116
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,850
There's no need for an apology.

117
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,410
After all, your acts

118
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,050
are meritorious anyway.

119
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,570
But...

120
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,090
You're right, Mother.

121
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,050
Even if you don't say it out,

122
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,170
I believe

123
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,610
my father will understand
your loyal and devoted heart.

124
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,090
You returned to the palace
after such hardship.

125
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,250
I will take you around

126
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,890
to see if anything has changed.

127
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,450
Lanying.

128
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,570
Yes.

129
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,210
Tell the cooks in my palace

130
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,570
to prepare a lot of food and drink

131
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,370
to welcome General Li.

132
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,290
Yes, I will go now.

133
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,810
Thank you, Mother.

134
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:51,970
I will take my leave.

135
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,690
I will take my leave.

136
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,330
Did you see her expression

137
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,130
when she just saw you?

138
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,570
As if she saw the Grim Reaper.

139
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,170
But with her carefulness,

140
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,810
I can't think of other ways

141
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,010
of visiting my father.

142
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,330
If we can't get in openly,

143
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,130
go secretly.

144
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,290
Secretly?

145
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,250
What do you mean, General Li?

146
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:24,890
Are you saying...?

147
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,330
Are you pigs?

148
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,490
It's been so long and we're still not
in Crown Prince's palace yet.

149
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:47,530
Your Highness.

150
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,930
It's our first time
in the imperial palace.

151
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,090
Who knew it would be so large?

152
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:51,970
Forget it.

153
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:52,810
Put me down.

154
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:53,610
Yes.

155
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,130
Where's the princess?

156
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:14,730
Where's she?

157
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,130
Did you see her?

158
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:16,850
No, I didn't.

159
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,610
It concerns my future.

160
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,810
I must hurry.

161
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,570
Crown Prince,

162
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,010
where on earth are you?

163
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:40,370
Stop.

164
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,290
- Why is it you?
- Why is it you?

165
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,050
Why are you here?

166
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,410
You don't want to see me?

167
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,130
But I saved your life.

168
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,370
That's not the case.

169
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,730
But this dress suits you more.

170
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,410
Are you from Jinshan Country?

171
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,810
What if I am?

172
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,810
But I don't have time
to chat with you today.

173
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,730
Since you're working in this palace,

174
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,810
you know
where the Crown Prince is, right?

175
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,370
The Crown Prince isn't someone
you can see whenever you want.

176
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,690
Go and report it.

177
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,690
I'm Jin Ziduo, the princess
of Jinshan, and I have important things.

178
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,370
Let's see if he'll come see me.

179
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:25,450
Okay.

180
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,050
I'm quite familiar with him anyway.

181
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,370
I'm going to see him too.

182
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,690
Come with me. Let's go.

183
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:38,810
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

184
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,370
(Yuling Palace)
There's no one here.

185
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,050
(Yuling Palace)
You can say it now.

186
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,690
So you're the Crown Prince?

187
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,090
Don't I look like one?

188
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,610
Greetings, Your Highness.

189
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,170
No need.

190
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,450
In my haste, my words were a bit rude.

191
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,130
I hope you are not offended.

192
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,570
This formality

193
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,610
makes me miss those days
when we didn't know each other.

194
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,690
It was so interesting.

195
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,530
I had regrets before,

196
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,690
but it turns out
it's a blessing in disguise.

197
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,650
The person I'm marrying
is the one I adore.

198
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,450
Your Highness,

199
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,410
let's save the sweet talk
for the wedding day.

200
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,410
The immediate issue

201
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,170
is that someone's after your life.

202
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,650
My life is as valuable
as the emperor's life.

203
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,610
Who dares to target me?

204
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,530
I heard our ambassador saying

205
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,930
he was going
to collaborate with Prince Chu

206
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,410
to poison you.

207
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,130
Your Highness,

208
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,690
are you

209
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,730
worried about me?

210
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,010
I am just…

211
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,250
I'm just trying

212
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,170
to avoid coming all this way
to be a widow.

213
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,210
Thank you for the warning.

214
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,930
But don't worry.

215
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,650
I haven't married you yet.

216
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,770
I can't bear to die so early.

217
00:09:51,018 --> 00:09:57,994
(Yuqing Palace)

218
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,130
(What is she doing here?)

219
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:13,706
(Yuqing Palace)

220
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,250
I'm Li Ziyi.

221
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,570
Greetings, Your Majesty.

222
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,410
I am incompetent.

223
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,170
I failed to protect you three years ago.

224
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,810
The Imperial Guards
were tragically killed by the rebel army

225
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,690
except that I lived a secret life.

226
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,010
It's because of my incompetence.

227
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,530
Please punish me.

228
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,330
