what a pity.

16
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,210
You were about to become mine.

17
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,370
So it is you.

18
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,010
Why do you do this?

Your Highness,

20
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,690
take a good look.

21
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,170
This is your real enemy.

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,650
She's the one

00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:24,050
who turned your father into that,

But rest assured.

Although I'm not your real mother,

30
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,570

of taking your life.

You, however, are sent here as a hostage

42
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,210
Of course, you can't accept it.

Shut up.

44
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,370
You think you're a manipulator

45
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,130
and things will go as you wish.

46
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,250

Once I get tired of playing,

52
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,450
I torment the toy bit by bit.

53
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,770
You're really pathetic.

54
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,370
What did you say?

00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,010
She said,

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,170
"You're really pathetic."

57
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,970
You think this measly bullet

58
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,210
can knock me down?

59

was only you.

Don't you think

89
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,570
this all feels like a dream?

90
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,410
Based on the rules,

91
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,530
you have to marry me
since you removed my mask.

92
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,610

In my family,

95
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,690
this is husband-and-wife etiquette.

96
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,810
(From the very beginning,)

97
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,330
(I shouldn't have doubted you.)

98
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:02,970
Young master,

99
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,130
didn't you say you wouldn't come?

100
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,330
You're worried about me, aren't you?

101
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,730
Without my permission in the future,

102
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,650

104
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,650

109
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,890
I have no other concerns.

110

113
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,210
What?

114
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,690
