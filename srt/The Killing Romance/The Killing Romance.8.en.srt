Sir,

15
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,850
you're finally here.

16
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,290
The one over there

17
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,090
has been waiting
for you for a long time.

18
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:12,530
=Episode 8=
(When Will You Stop Pretending)

19
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,010
Drink.

20
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,330
Delicious.

21
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,730
Go on drinking.

22
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,610
You play the guqin very well.

23
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,050
Come on.

24
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,290
Have a drink.

25
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:34,730
Drink it.

26
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,650
Come on, sir.

27
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:37,730
Sir?

28
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,890
Isn't it a bit conspicuous
to choose this place?

29
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,370
The most glamorous brothel
in Liyue City.

30
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,690
The more conspicuous,

31
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,330
the more reassured the empress will be.

32
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,570
It must be hard.

33
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,570
Not at all.

34
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,010
I'm just finding joy in bitterness.

35
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,410
At least the girls here are obedient

36
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,650
and sensible.

37
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,490
Girls, it's time to leave.

38
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,730
Sir Li was a trusted subordinate
of my father.

39
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,650
His death must have been instigated
by someone.

40
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,410
In fact, yesterday,

41
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,570
I was at the Court of Judicial Review.

42
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,890
Help! Someone!

43
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:00,930
Who sent you?

44
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,690
Tell me, and I can spare your life.

45
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,210
Who exactly are you?

46
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,090
I went there to check

47
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,090
the files related to the poison.

48
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:42,650
Unexpectedly,

49
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,970
Sir Li was involved

50
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,250
and died from the poison.

51
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,810
There's something I haven't told you.

52
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,810
I once happened to see my father

53
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,690
with a slight blueness.

54
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,570
Just as I suspected.

55
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,210
It seems the goals of the person behind

56
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,330
are not just the few lives.

57
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,250
I'm afraid it's the supremacy.

58
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,810
Was the assassin captured?

59
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,290
It seems this ice water
isn't interesting enough.

60
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,890
This man is already dozing off.

61
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,570
Servants,

62
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,730
put quicksilver in his mouth.

63
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,170
(Ghost Town.)

64
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,170
Don't let him starve.

65
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,250
The empress forced
my biological mother to death.

66
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,970
My father's condition is dire now.

67
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,730
If we don't hurry,

68
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,970
I fear my days are numbered too.

69
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,690
We Dragon Guardians

70
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,890
are devoted to the service
of royalty for generations,

71
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,290
even willing to risk our lives.

72
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,850
When the time comes, Your Highness,

73
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,250
please vindicate
my wrongly killed family.

74
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,530
You are a subject

75
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,970
and also my friend.

76
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,250
Remember this.

77
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,730
Never gamble with your life

78
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,010
at any time.

79
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,610
Only by staying alive

80
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,250
can you hold the hope
of rectifying everything.

81
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,250
It's my duty as your man.

82
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,250
How did I get back here?

83
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,010
Am I close to death?

84
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,570
Why am I so feeble?

(But she suddenly fainted.)

91
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,970
(Could she have contracted
that strange poison as well?)

92
00:07:17,706 --> 00:07:18,810
Water...

93
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,290
