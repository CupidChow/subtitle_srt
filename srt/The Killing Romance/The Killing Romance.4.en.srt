Mother,

26
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,290
it's my fault.

27
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,890
I couldn't be with you
when you were in danger.

28
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:07,090
All these years, you've been thoughtful
and protected me in every way.

29
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,210
Yet, I haven't done anything for you.

30
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,530
I will definitely find out the truth

31
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,490
and avenge you.

32
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:24,690

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,010
Young Master Wuji has been nice to me.

35
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,530
I'm having a happy life.

36
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,410
Thanks for your sympathy

37
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,930
and for being willing to set up
my parents' memorial tablets here.

38
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,770
Don't mention it.

39
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,450
Your family
is also the young master's family.

40
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,570
Did your parents offend anyone?

41
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,450
Or did they have a confrontation
with someone?

42
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,890
My parents were honest and sincere.

43
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,050
They always ran an honest business.

44
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,490
They had never had a conflict
with anyone.

45
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,370
Do you have any enemies?

46
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,410
Do you mean

47
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,170
the person who should have died was me,

48
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,530
but my parents died instead?

49
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:24,690
No.

50
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,170
I'm just looking for relevant clues.

51
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,650
I grew up in my family's cloth shop
since I was a child.

52
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,810
My parents were very loving to me
because they had me at their old age.

53
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,570
I've been learning about cloth
and weaving with my mother since childhood.

54
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,570
I hardly have any contact
with outsiders.

55
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,770
Let alone enemies.

56
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,490
I don't even have any friends.

57
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:44,650
Then you...

58
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,090
Young master, you should leave now.

59
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,210
Miss, you should rest well first.

60
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,610
We won't disturb you anymore.

61
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,850
Young master, there's something
I don't know if I should say.

62
00:03:58,890 --> 00:03:59,690
Speak up.

63
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,890
You were just

64
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,130
inhuman.

65
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,450
Why was I inhuman?

66
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,610
Miss Tang has just lost her parents.

67
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,210
You did not console her

68
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,010
but interrogated her
about her entire family.

69
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,410
You made them sound like people
who ran an illegal business.

70
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,930
Who did they offend?

71
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,530
And confrontation? Conflict?

72
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,850
In the end, you even mentioned enemies.

73
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:22,610
Alright.

74
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,250
Something is strange.

75
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,770
I was just trying to help her
uncover the truth.

76
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,290
Is this the right time
to investigate this?

77
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,570
Is it the right occasion?

78
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:30,810
Miss Tang

79
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,210
lost her family, her cloth shop,
and her home.

80
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:33,610
You...

81
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,570
Young master, what's wrong?

82
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,250
Young master?

83
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,370
Help me get back to my room first.

84
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,730
(Could he be injured?)

85
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,690
Why didn't you tell me you were injured?

86
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,250
It's nothing.

87
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,330
This wound...

88
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,330
Why does it look so strange?

89
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:26,970
Don't touch it.

90
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,010
This is corpse poison from the west.

91
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,530
Once it enters the bloodstream,

92
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,170
it produces
a large amount of corrosive poison,

93
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,530
which then keeps expanding,

94
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,170
resulting in a corpse explosion.

00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,690

However, what's your relationship
with the Tang family?

Why would you go to such lengths
for them?

156
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,010
I'm not here for the Tang family,

but for myself.

158
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,330

159
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,170
those who knew this poison
had been wiped out long ago.

160
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:23,650

all the earlier cases

161

involving this poison, right?

162
