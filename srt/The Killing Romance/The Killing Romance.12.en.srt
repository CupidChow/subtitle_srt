Have a look.

Miss, have a taste.

19
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:12,930
Is it tasty?

20
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:13,490
Yes.

21
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:14,490
You want some?

22
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,250
I want this,

00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,130
and this,

00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:17,250
and candied fruit.

00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:17,970
One of each.

00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:19,570
You have quite a taste.

These are all our best sellers.

28
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,530

Keep the change.

30
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,610
Thank you.

31
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,290

Over here.

35
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:46,250
Come back with us.

36
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:46,730
You can't run away.

37
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:47,370
This is for you.

38
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,370
Hush, don't speak yet.

39
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,890
I am being chased.

40
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:17,930
Blink if you understand.

41
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:20,890
Young master, you are so handsome.

42
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,490
You must have a merciful heart.

43
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:23,890
Please save me,

44
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,530
merciful sir.

45
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,570
How bold of them!

46
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,210
To chase you

47
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,330
in broad daylight.

48
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,290
Don't worry, miss.

49
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:38,810
Under my protection,

50
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,170
i-in this carriage,

51
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,130
you will definitely be safe.

52
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:46,650
Is there anything wrong?

53
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,050
What could be wrong?

54
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,170
Step down.

55
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,610
Those people

56
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:53,970
are outrageous

57
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:54,890
and blind to beauty.

58
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:56,770
Miss,

59
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,250
what are they forcing you to do

60
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,650
by chasing you like this?

61
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,170
They're forcing me into marriage.

62
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:03,970
That's why I escaped here.

63
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,650
I didn't expect them
to chase me down here.

64
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:08,570
I understand you.

65
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,570
I know too well what it's like

66
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,650
to be forced.

67
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,850
Thank you for saving me.

68
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:13,770
Young master,

69
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,730
I don't have much money on me.

70
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:17,810
Please take this.

71
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,370
Miss, you're really cheeky.

72
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,370
Miss, what's your name?

73
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,650
Good day, Madam.

74
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,090
Xiao Fang.

75
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,730
Xiao Fang.

76
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,010
Come here.

77
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:08,410
Madam.

78
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:08,970
Xiao Fang,

79
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,770
young master hasn't healed yet.

80
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,850
Why has he started working?

81
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,450
It's Double Seventh Festival soon.

82
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,770
Actually, the young master

83
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,250
insists on personally organizing

84
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,090
annual Double Seventh Festival banquet.

85
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,650
What is the banquet for?

86
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,010
Normally, during the festival,

87
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,370
there would be
traditional lantern puzzles,

88
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,410
garden parties, and so on.

89
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,850
However, the young master
implied that this year,

90
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,050
he wants to make some changes.

91
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,930
(Should I take the banquet
as an opportunity)

92
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,090
(to confess to him?)

93
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:37,690
By the way, Madam,

94
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,570
young master's birthday
is the day after tomorrow.

95
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,290
Have you prepared

96
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:42,450
the gift?

97
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,610
Just wait and see.

98
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:51,650
Mind your step.

99
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,490
What's with the mystery?

100
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,170
Stand here.

101
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:55,690
Here?

102
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:56,850
Alright.

103
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,930
Okay, you can open your eyes now.

104
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,250
I heard from Xiao Fang

105
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,090
that you do not like
to celebrate your birthday,

106
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,890
but you can at least
accept a gift, right?

107
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,330
This style looks so novel.

108
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,290
Which tailor made it?

109
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,770
I made it myself, alright?

110
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,210
To have it done in time,

111
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,850
I've worn my fingers.

112
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:44,930
Sorry for the pain you endured.

113
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,130
So the other day,
when you took the clothes from my room,

114
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,370
you wanted to know my size.

115
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,330
But I scolded you for it.

116
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:53,610
It's okay.

117
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,930
Let's try this on for size first, okay?

118
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:56,410
Okay.

119
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,250
Then

120
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,890
