(Back to the Start and Wrap It All Up)

15
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,810
You were quite gentle last night,

16
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,690
not like you at all.

17
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,730
You don't like it?

18
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,450
Then how about

19
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,010
I act a little harsher towards you?

20
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,290
Madam.

21
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,170
Young master.

22
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,370
I know we shouldn't interrupt you,

23
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:42,970
but...

24
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,850
The flower-selling old woman
that you asked me to find

25
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,770
has been found.

26
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:48,930
She's called Old Lady Xu.

27
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,210
She didn't make a living
selling flowers until recently.

28
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,850
She performed rites
as a witch for a living before.

29
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,050
Performing rites?

30
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:55,730
Yes.

31
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,210
However, when I found her,

32
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,730
she looked pale and thin.

33
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,690
I'm afraid
she doesn't have long to live.

34
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:26,690
Old Lady Xu.

35
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,370
Li Ziyi,

36
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,650
you are finally here.

37
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,410
I was so afraid
that I'd die before you arrived

38
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,090
and would have to take everything

39
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,170
with me into the coffin.

40
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,730
What exactly happened?

41
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,610
Help me up

42
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,090
and let me catch my breath.

43
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,370
Three years ago,

44
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,330
that night, both sides
suffered heavy casualties.

45
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,570
The emperor was seriously ill,

46
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,450
and the empress took over.

47
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,970
She secretly ordered her men
to bury everything in the ground

48
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:23,330
and made the recorders gloss over
the battle with a few words

49
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:27,130
to make sure
the truth would be never found.

50
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,690
My fellow guards

51
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,370
shed their blood for the court,

52
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,690
unmindful of their own lives.

53
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,530
In the end, however,
they ended up buried with those rebels.

54
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,290
Even in the underworld,

55
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,410
I'm afraid they wouldn't rest in peace.

56
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,970
But what can they do?

57
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,250
Heaven above,

58
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,930
you and I are but ants,

59
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,370
a grain in the great sea.

60
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,170
What we leave behind

61
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,250
is nothing

62
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,290
but countless dust.

63
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,050
It was those soldiers

64
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,690
diligently guarding
their notion of justice

65
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,530
like ants

66
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,650
who brought our peace and prosperity.

67
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:14,850
What happened next?

68
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,610
Was I also taken to the mass grave?

69
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,410
You were originally carried
by people ready for a grand funeral.

70
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,010
However, on the way,
the route was suddenly changed,

71
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,250
heading towards the mass grave.

72
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,210
Luckily, your brother,

73
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,610
Governor Li,

74
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,610
arrived just in time.

75
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:47,370
Stop!

76
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:48,690
How dare you!

77
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,130
How could General Li be buried
with these rebels?

78
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,730
Go bring Old Lady Xu here.

79
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,810
Ziyi,

80
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,250
I'm taking you home.

81
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,730
Your brother took you back
to your mansion for treatment.

82
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,690
Your stab wounds were not vital ones.

83
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,930
And you had a strong constitution.

84
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:20,290
So you recovered very soon.

85
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,290
But every time Sir Li visited you,

86
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,530
you remained silent.

87
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:32,250
So Sir Li came to me for help.

88
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,890
I learned some wizardry years ago,

89
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,690
and I can take people's memories

90
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,490
through objects.

91
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,930
When Sir Li asked me for help,

92
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,250
I refused at first.

93
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,370
Because everything in the world

94
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,290
has its own fate.

95
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,690
But he didn't want
to see you suffer anymore

96
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,050
and pleaded with me.

97
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,050
In the end,

98
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,050
I agreed.

99
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,250
I used this flower bracelet

100
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,650
to lock your memory.

101
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,810
Then, my brother asked
the Tang family to be my parents,

102
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,090
so I became Tang Xiaolu.

103
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,410
Then why did you give
the flower bracelet back to me?

104
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,810
Did my brother ask you to do it?

105
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:29,930
I guess

106
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,730
it was due to the murder
of the Tang couple.

107
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,250
I didn't completely take your memories

108
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,410
because I was afraid that one day

109
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,170
you'd finally encounter

110
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,890
what you had to face.

111
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,010
Do you know who killed the Tang couple?

112
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,170
Old Lady Xu.

113
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,330
Old Lady Xu.

114
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,410
Who on earth killed my parents?

115
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,010
What should we do next, Master?

116
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,250
Back to the start

117
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,690
and wrap it all up.

118
00:07:37,664 --> 00:07:41,034
(Complete Victory)

119
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,210
What a ludicrous occurrence!

120
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,890
I only knew about the wrongs borne
by the Imperial Agents

121
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,810
but didn't know the Imperial Guards
were also implicated.

122
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,930
Please calm your anger.

123
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,810
Fortunately, General Li is still alive.

124
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,210
Have you two already...?

125
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,690
Now that the truth is clear,
we can't delay.

126
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,930
I have a favor to ask.

127
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:22,890
I will take General Li

128
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,210
with me back to the palace tomorrow.

129
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:32,970
This is...

130
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:33,850
The Tiger Tally.

131
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:34,410
What?

132
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,250
Years ago, the emperor
let me have this Tiger Tally

133
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,130
for temporary safekeeping.

134
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,370
It seems he anticipated the rebellion.

135
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,410
Now, I'm returning it
to its rightful owner.

136
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,930
Things are unpredictable in the palace.

137
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,250
It's safer to have this
for self-protection.

138
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,810
You want me to protect
General Li, right?

139
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:57,770
Another round?

140
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,690
Bring it on.

141
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,690
