How dare you!

16
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,538
You, the Dragon Guardians,
are the royal family's secret agents.

17
00:02:27,538 --> 00:02:29,898
How dare you
intrude the Yuqing Palace at night!

18
00:02:30,178 --> 00:02:31,578
It's an unforgivable sin!

00:03:56,952 --> 00:03:59,736
(Leader of the Dragon Guardians)

20
00:04:09,013 --> 00:04:11,040
I want you dead!

21
00:04:42,055 --> 00:04:43,015
(It's this dream again.)

(Don't shout I can't hear you.)

26
00:05:19,962 --> 00:05:21,402
(It's about to happen.)

27
00:05:21,427 --> 00:05:24,387
(Is this the so-called first kiss?)

28
00:05:24,412 --> 00:05:25,412
Miss.

29
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:26,932
Miss, something bad happened.

(Tang Xiaolu, daughter of Tang Family)

31
00:05:30,692 --> 00:05:32,292
Someone's here to propose to you again.

Quick, let's go.

33
00:05:33,492 --> 00:05:34,692
What? Again?

34
00:05:35,132 --> 00:05:36,612
Don't they ever give up?

35
00:05:36,812 --> 00:05:37,932
I'll teach them a lesson.

36
00:05:37,932 --> 00:05:38,772
- Hurry.
- Let's go.

37
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,399
There's a marriage festival today.

38
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,759
I'm gonna get all dressed up.

39
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,959
Yeah. I'm looking forward to it.

40
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,279
What day is it today?

41
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:51,959
It's so lively.

42
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,759
Miss.

43
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,119
Today is the important

44
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,399
Marriage Festival in Liyue City.

45
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,439
There's a lot of lovers out there.

46
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,839
Is everyone in such a hurry to find someone?

47
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,239
Miss, you may not realize this.

48
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,439
Besides trying to find a good marriage,

49
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,999
people like to meet the world's greatest matchmaker.

50
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,879
Young Master Wuji.

51
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,599
Why do people want to meet him?

52
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,199
Young Master Wuji,

53
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,759
he's not only a good in matchmaking,

54
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,199
he also has a beautiful face

55
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,479
and jade like skin.

56
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,959
Have you seen him?

57
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,279
Miss, you're joking.

58
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,799
If you want to meet Young Master Wuji, you need a lot of money.

59
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,679
I can only dream about it.

60
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,359
A lot of money.

61
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,039
A lot of money.

62
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,679
The thing Tang family has no shortage

63
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,359
is money.

64
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,559
Let's go.

65
00:06:32,049 --> 00:06:34,609
If your daughter marries into the Chen family,

66
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:36,769
that will guarantee her a worry-free life.

67
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:43,369
Why is it you again?

68
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:44,249
You old hag,

69
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:45,489
off you go.

70
00:06:47,049 --> 00:06:48,009
Go.

71
00:06:48,489 --> 00:06:49,129
- Madam Tang!
- Go.

72
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:51,009
You!

73
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:58,169
Do you have someone you fancy?

74
00:06:58,649 --> 00:06:59,529
Of course.

75
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:01,129


76
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,609
Mother, give me some money.

77
00:07:10,142 --> 00:07:13,950
(Market, Liyue City)

78
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:28,049
I'm finally

79
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:29,649
free!

80
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:35,409
Sugar-coated haws!

81
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:38,129
Miss, are you robbing me?

82
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:39,609
Here's the money.

83
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:42,809
Come take a look!

84
00:07:42,809 --> 00:07:43,769
These items in my collection

85
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:46,009
were all touched or used by Young Master Wuji.

86
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,249
Each of them is precious.

87
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:48,649
By purchasing this,

88
00:07:49,049 --> 00:07:52,529
you can enjoy exclusive, intimate contact with him.

89
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:55,929
(This is insane.)

90
00:07:55,929 --> 00:07:57,809
(It's just an ordinary bracelet.)

91
00:07:57,809 --> 00:07:59,729
(Who knows if Young Master Wuji has ever worn it?)

92
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,009
(And everyone is rushing to buy it.)

93
00:08:01,049 --> 00:08:01,849
(I'm speechless.)

94
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:04,249
Move aside! Don't block the way!

95
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:05,569
You!

96
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:08,649
Forget it. I won't stoop to your level.

97
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:10,209
This exquisite jade comb

98
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:13,169
was once carried by Young Master Wuji.

99
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,209
Do you know that?

100
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:17,249
Day and night, it passed
through his thick and beautiful hair.

101
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:19,249
Who wants it?

102
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,009
(Thick and beautiful hair?)

103
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:23,129
(Isn't this phrase used to describe women?)

104
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:25,729
(Wearing bracelets and enjoying combing his hair?)

105
00:08:26,049 --> 00:08:29,249
(This Young Master Wuji's taste is really unique.)

106
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:33,049
(I'm getting more and more curious about him now.)

107
00:08:34,449 --> 00:08:35,809
This is his true likeness.

108
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:39,649
Ladies who didn't get the tickets to
the Marriage Festival, come and look.

109
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:42,489
It's a one-to-one, high-definition portrait.

110
00:08:43,102 --> 00:08:46,609
Buy it, and you will have
Young Master Wuji in your house.

111
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,969
(The man in my dreams?)

112
00:08:50,969 --> 00:08:52,609
The city's best painter painted this

113
00:08:52,609 --> 00:08:54,649
for Young Master Wuji face-to-face.

114
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:56,449
I want it! Young Master Wuji!

115
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:02,049
It seems that I must go to this Marriage Festival.

116
00:09:04,249 --> 00:09:05,009
Show me your card.

117
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:06,209
Let me in. I have a card.

118
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:07,249
I have one.

119
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:09,649
If you have a card, show it.

120
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:12,689
(Xiao Fang, Butler)
Come on.

121
00:09:12,689 --> 00:09:14,049
Okay, come in.

122
00:09:14,049 --> 00:09:15,209
Let me in.

123
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:16,089
Well,

124
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,369
the venue is full now.

125
00:09:17,369 --> 00:09:18,129
Let me look too.

126
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:19,809
So those without cards,

127
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:20,369
please...

128
00:09:20,369 --> 00:09:22,049
Can I go in now?

129
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,119
Come, come, come.

130
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,919


131
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,159
Don't squeeze.

132
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,199
We have a rule this time.

133
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,959
Every beautiful people

134
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,919
have to cover their face to get in.

135
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,519
Cover the face?

136
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,479
How do I get it?

137
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,479
That's it.

138
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,519
Don't push. Don't push.

139
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,559
Please leave.

140
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,199
See which one you like better.

141
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,999
This one.

142
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,319
(I have such a good taste.)

143
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:07,161
Please.

144
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,599
(I'm glad I made it.)

145
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,599
(I'm exhausted.)

146
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:43,893
Why is she here?

147
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:46,333
This mask is so ugly.

148
00:10:46,893 --> 00:10:49,173
(Why are they all looking at me?)

149
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:52,773
(Where is Young Master Wuji?)

150
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,573
Ladies and gentlemen,

(I must be blushing now.)

170
00:12:13,493 --> 00:12:15,613
(Thank goodness I'm wearing a mask.)

171
00:12:15,973 --> 00:12:17,373
(Otherwise, it would be embarrassing.)

Young master, speak!

174

Back to the point,

00:12:26,173 --> 00:12:28,813
the Marriage Festival of this year
has completely changed its precedent.

176
00:12:28,813 --> 00:12:30,802
The theme this time is Feelings at First Sight.

177
00:12:30,802 --> 00:12:31,373
(Feelings at First Sight)

178
00:12:31,373 --> 00:12:32,133
(Feelings at First Sight)
Xiao Fang.

179
00:12:32,754 --> 00:12:34,773
You have all put on masks.

180
00:12:34,893 --> 00:12:37,133
Nobody sees each other's faces.

181
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,573
There is no need for introductions.

182
00:12:38,893 --> 00:12:41,373
Naturally, no one knows
about each other's background.

183
00:12:41,893 --> 00:12:42,893
The rule is simple.

184
00:12:42,893 --> 00:12:45,746
Each lady shall demonstrate her talent
in front of the crowd.

185
00:12:45,746 --> 00:12:47,533
The gentlemen can make a choice afterwards.

186
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,202
If the lady accepts,

187
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:50,733
they may both remove their masks.

188
00:12:51,218 --> 00:12:52,173
It should be noted

189
00:12:52,493 --> 00:12:53,613
that once the masks are removed,

190
00:12:53,613 --> 00:12:56,594
it implies both parties have
set their hearts on each other,

191
00:12:56,594 --> 00:12:58,333
just like making a marriage promise.

192
00:12:59,973 --> 00:13:02,333
Okay, everyone. Let's get started.

193
00:13:02,613 --> 00:13:04,093
(I'm really "impressed".)

194
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,570
(Predestined Marriage)

195
00:13:08,573 --> 00:13:09,693
Nice figure.

196
00:13:09,973 --> 00:13:10,773
So charming.

197
00:13:11,613 --> 00:13:12,493
Sounds so good.

198
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:15,213
Not as good as my dance.

199
00:13:16,893 --> 00:13:17,693
Bravo.

200
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,813
Let's welcome the fourth lady.

201
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,893
(What should I do to get his attention?)

202
00:13:25,373 --> 00:13:27,813
(This mask is stifling me.)

203
00:13:27,813 --> 00:13:28,773
Lady number four?

204
00:13:29,573 --> 00:13:30,293
What's up?

205
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:33,813
(I got it.)

206
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:36,173
Why are you giving this to me?

207
00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:37,133
Hold it, please.

208
00:13:44,146 --> 00:13:45,573
She pulled it down.

209
00:13:47,573 --> 00:13:48,413
Is she going to fly?

210
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,333
What is she doing?

211
00:14:11,373 --> 00:14:14,613
(Why am I feeling a bit dizzy?)

212
00:14:39,026 --> 00:14:41,733
Young master, I'm feeling suffocated.

213
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,733
You didn't die?
