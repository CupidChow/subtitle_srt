Wuji's investigation

37
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,090
is related to the murder of Tang family.

38
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,650
He can't die yet.

39
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:14,170
Master, are you soft on him?

40
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,530
He's one of the Dragon Guardians
who put you in danger three years ago.

41
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,690
Tang family was kind to me.

42
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,330
I must investigate their case.

43
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,490
If it was really Wuji

44
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,330
who tried to kill me back then,

45
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,970
I will kill him with my own hands.

46
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,410
Mi'er,

47
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,530
you should cooperate well with me
in the performance later.

48
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,210
Before that,

49
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,290
do not act rashly.

50
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:45,890
Yes, Master.

51
00:03:50,378 --> 00:03:56,074
(Yuqing Palace)

52
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,330
Lanying,

53
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:16,450
do you know why people
compare women to flowers?

54
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,570
Flowers won't stay blooming for long.

55
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,570
Even if they're gorgeous,

56
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,570
it's just for a fleeting moment.

57
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,730
But you are the empress.

58
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,010
You will keep your youth

59
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,810
and beauty forever.

60
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:50,570
Your Majesty,

61
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,570
you never understand what I want.

62
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,690
If you can sleep peacefully like this,

63
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,890
I can be tolerant of you.

64
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,850
The poison in His Majesty's body

65
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,050
has moved from the throat

66
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,610
to the heart and lungs.

67
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,770
Good.

68
00:05:47,274 --> 00:05:50,130
(Yuqing Palace)

69
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,370
Your Majesty, Prince Chu
is waiting outside the palace.

70
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,826
Let him in.

71
00:05:54,826 --> 00:05:55,330
Yes.

72
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,090
Greetings, Your Majesty.

73
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,650
May you have a good day.

74
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:06,930
Prince Chu, please rise.

75
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,850
Thank you.

76
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,970
I have an important matter
to report to you alone.

77
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,650
Lanying is one of us.

78
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,010
It's okay to say it in front of her.

79
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,530
Yes.

80
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:25,770
Your Majesty,

81
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,770
the situation in Jinshan is urgent.

82
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,090
Now they are willing
to propose a marriage alliance.

83
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,010
Once the marriage alliance is achieved,

84
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,450
they are bound to help you
with all their strength.

85
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,410
Good.

86
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,970
It's just what I wanted.

87
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,810
Lately, the Crown Prince
has been leaving the palace frequently.

88
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,490
I fear something is afoot.

89
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,170
I will leave this matter to you.

90
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,586
The sooner it is solved, the better.

91
00:06:48,586 --> 00:06:49,210
Yes.

92
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,890
The princess of Jinshan
has already arrived in Liyue City.

93
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,530
In my opinion,

94
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,850
we should let the Crown Prince
marry her as soon as possible.

95
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,370
However, as per reports from our spies,

96
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,250
recently, the Crown Prince
often visits the Huafeng House,

97
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,530
a brothel.

98
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,490
I'm afraid
it might damage his reputation.

99
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,282
If the princess of Jinshan finds out,

100
00:07:14,282 --> 00:07:16,490
the marriage alliance might be affected.

101
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:17,810
Affected?

102
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,490
That's impossible.

103
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,330
Also,

104
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,890
how is the matter
with Governor Li going on?

105
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,330
Is there any suspicion?

106
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,170
Your Majesty, don't worry.

107
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,690
I have already spread the rumors

108
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:34,130
saying that Governor Li poisoned himself
as he was found colluding with the enemy

109
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,210
and planning treason.

110
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,290
But there has been intervention
in the process.

111
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,730
The people who have been bothering you

112
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,970
have seemingly joined forces.

113
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,890
At the crucial moment,

114
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,810
you can eliminate the root cause.

115
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,450
There must be no mistakes.

116
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:57,890
Yes.

117
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,290
I'll take my leave.

118
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,650
Everything is under control.

119
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,210
You can rest assured.

120
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,530
It seems your health
has been fully recovered.

121
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,850
Yes, I'm fine now.

122
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,210
I was just thinking

123
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,770
that since we are
already husband and wife,

124
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,930
we don't have to sleep
in separate rooms anymore.

125
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,650
So I asked Xi'er
to move all my things over here.

126
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,450
My dear,

127
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,010
you wouldn't mind, would you?

128
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,730
Why would I mind?

129
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,170
I'm sorry for not being considerate.

130
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,930
I should have
shared the bed with you earlier.

131
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,890
So this is what you referred to
as sleeping together?

132
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:30,250
I occasionally snore when I sleep.

133
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,050
I'm afraid it might disturb your rest.

134
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,530
It doesn't matter.

135
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,930
We are a couple, after all.

136
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,530
We should always care for each other.

137
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,490
Speaking of that,

138
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,490
may I ask you a question?

139
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,370
Feel free to ask.

140
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,970
Have you ever heard

141
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,850
of the Dragon Guardians?

142
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,130
