3
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,120
So this is

4
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,040
what driving feels like.

5
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,720
I quite like it.

6
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,560
I'm glad you like it.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,200
I hope that no matter when or where,

8
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,680
you can control your life freely

9
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,400
like when you're driving.

10
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,000
However, is this car

11
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,440
exactly the same

12
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,560
as the one at home?

13
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,480
Yes.

14
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,360
It's a couple's car.

15
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:08,680
What a waste.

16
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,760
Even if you're a big boss,

17
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,520
you can't waste money like this.

18
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,720
Then instruct me.

19
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,640
Instruct you? Who am I to instruct you?

20
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,200
Marry me.

21
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,520
In this way,

22
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,920
you can be my boss.

23
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,680
Marry you?

24
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,680
Are you really going to

25
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,320
propose to me like this?

26
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,680
No, how could I be so hasty?

27
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,320
However,

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,480
just in case I get impulsive

29
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,760

00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,320
