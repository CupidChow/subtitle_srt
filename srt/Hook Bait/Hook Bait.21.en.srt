3
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,400
Look!

4
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,680
Brother!

5
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,000
Why are you here?

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,640
You cheating scumbag!

7
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,400
You have a fiancee.
How dare you come here?

8
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,360
Well...

9
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,120
You... Yu,

10
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,920
shouldn't you give us an explanation?

11
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,760
For what?

12
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,840
So,

13
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,560
this is all your plan, right?

14
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,680
Yes, it's our plan.

15
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,960
However, the engagement with Lin Shu

16
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,800
was an accident.

17
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,000
By the way,

18
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,440
how did it go with Wu Jing?

19
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,480
They took us for fools.

20
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,640
Will Zhou Song suspect you?

21
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,280
Don't worry, I've found out

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,280
their secrets.

23
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,120
Okay.

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,960
By the way,

25
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,440
are you trying

26
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,120
to find a new boyfriend for Cheng Yu?

27
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,080
Don't you dare

28
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,640
tell anyone about us.

29
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,040
Here are the share transfer agreements

30
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,400
of Wanchuan Group

31
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,600
and several subsidiaries.

32
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,240
If you sign them,

33
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,480
everything I have

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,400
will be yours.

35
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,680
What are you up to?

36
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,120
Once you get everything,

37
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,120
you can use the money

38
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,360
to purchase

39
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,520
or invest in Hongye Group.

40
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,960
I won't stop you.

41
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,200
You taught me that there's

42
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,480
no such thing as a free lunch.

43
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,800
What do you want?

44
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,880
Do you remember

45
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,240
we used Shenghua Group

46
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,600
to manipulate Hongye Group?

47
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,160
Pei Zheng came back to investigate this.

48
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,720
He's probably got

49
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,960
the information

50
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,520
from Wu Jing.

51
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,200
Help me intercept the documents

52
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,120
and teach him a lesson.

53
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,720
From now on, we'll continue
to work together,

54
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,360
and there will be no more worries.

55
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,640
It turns out you're scared.

56
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,800
That's why you thought of me.

57
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,200
I won't be your pawn anymore.

58
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,400
When the truth comes out,

59
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,480
neither of us will get away with it.

60
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,160
In that case, your canary

61
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,920
will really fly away.

62
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,840
Dad.

63
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,600
What do you need?

64
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,470
You know exactly what it is, don't you?

65
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,560
Zheng,

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,880
I didn't raise you much
when you were young,

67
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,980
but you are still

68
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,820
my biological son.

69
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,380
What kind of son would try

70
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,980
to ruin his own father?

71
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,140
Don't you think so?

72
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,940
I called you back...

73
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,180
to beg you

74
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,100
to have mercy on me.

75
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:47,940
Back then,

76
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,060
you cheated on

77
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,620
my mother

78
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,620
and took over the group after she died

79
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,540
in an accident.

80
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,060
I only want to get my things back.

81
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,260
You did nasty things, so

82
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,980
don't blame me
for catching you red-handed.

83
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,820
Zheng.

84
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,540
After all, I'm your father.

85
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,140
No matter what,

86
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,600
we don't have to

87
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,340
be enemies.

88
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,300
You'll get Wanchuan Group

89
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,060
and Shenghua Group sooner or later.

90
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,460
Let's each take a step back

91
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,980
and stop fighting.

92
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,860
What do you think?

93
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,620
What if...

94
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,620
I don't want to?

95
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,420
Hello,

96
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,900
have you decrypted the documents?

97
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,140
We need about 28 hours.

98
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,460
Thanks.

99
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,140
We're brothers, so don't be polite.

100
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,660
You can introduce

101
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,820
a beautiful girl to me.

102
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,380
I don't know any beautiful girls.

103
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,260
Maybe you can introduce Ms. Cheng...

104
00:04:59,130 --> 00:04:59,970
Go away.

105
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,140
See?

106
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,300
I got you.

107
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,820
You pretended to break up.

108
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,900
I've sent someone

109
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,580
to take care of Mr. Zhao for good.

110
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,940
Did you kill him?

111
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,660
Unfortunately, Pei Zheng
caught Wu Jing.

112
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,620
We're on the same boat.

113
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,300
Next, you'll deal with Pei Zheng.

114
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,940
When this is over,

115
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,060
you'll get an extra 15 percent share

116
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,900
of the project in the south of the city.

117
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,820
You want to drag me into this.

118
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,140
This is illegal.

119
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,820
Who told you to do it yourself?

120
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,340
You have plenty of henchmen.

121
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,940
You've trained them for so many years,

122
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,860
so it's time to let them repay you.

123
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,700
Go back and think about it.

124
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,580
I'll be waiting for your good news.

125
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,660
Just get to the point.

126
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,540
No rush.

127
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,340
Let's wait until everyone is here.

128
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,820
What do you mean?

129
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,380
Lin Shu,

130
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,580
what do you mean?

131
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,630
I knew you didn't break up.

132
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,480
Thank you.

133
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,620
You planned

134
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,130
all this to return

135
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,140
to the Zhou Family.

136
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,140
But don't be nervous.

137
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,940
I'm not here to declare a war.

138
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,700
I want to tell you

139
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,820
I've decided to cancel the engagement.

140
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,860
Really?

141
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,940
I've seen through
Zhou Song's true colors.

142
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,820
I don't want to get involved

143
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,260
in this mess anymore.

144
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,820
I only care about Lin Group.

145
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,500
Whoever infringes on my interests

146
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,260
is my enemy.

147
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,100
Ms. Lin,

148
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,100
you're smarter

149
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,340
than I expected.

150
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,220
Of course.

151
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,540
Unlike you,

152
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,860
I'm not crazy for love.

153
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,980
It's boring.

154
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,160
Back then, I thought

155
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,250
only Wanchuan Group's heir

156
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,430
deserved to be my husband.

157
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,280
But because of you,

158
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,580
I've realized that

159
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,380
only a marriage with love
can last and be happy.

160
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,090
I will definitely find

161
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,410
my Mr. Right

162
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,400
and live happily.

163
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,420
You're clear-headed.

164
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,180
You dare to love and give up.

165
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,820
Unfortunately,

166
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,580
I didn't get to know you earlier.

167
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,700
Otherwise, Zhou Jin
wouldn't have got a chance.

168
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,460
You're so funny.

169
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,780
Well,

170
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,900
are you afraid she'll get mad?

171
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,460
I was just kidding.

172
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,200
I admire you for having the courage

173
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,300
to be together.

174
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,020
Besides,

175
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,780
Cheng Yu,

176
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,060
I really envy you.

177
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,060
It's brave for a canary

178
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,060
to escape.

179
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,300
Lin Shu,

180
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,020
Zheng was right about one thing.

181
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,020
You are truly outstanding.

182
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,300
After all, in Jiangcheng,

183
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,780
you're the only woman
under 30 who earned the title

184
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,340
of Emerging

185
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,460
Female Entrepreneur.

186
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,220
Pei Zheng, you should know

187
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,820
what it means to be

188
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,140
Zhou Song's enemy.

189
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,020
Anyway, just be careful.

190
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:14,900
By the way,

191
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,260
I prepared a gift for you.

192
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,740
I think it can help you.

193
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,360
One more thing.

194
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,860
I'm going abroad.

195
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,980
Goodbye.

196
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,470
♪But I forgot one thing♪

197
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,080
♪Time cannot be stopped♪

198
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,380
Don't worry.

199
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,540
You still need to be careful.

200
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,060
Cheng Yu,

201
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,340
I won't let you leave me.

202
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,220
We must

203
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,500
stay together forever.
