Slow... Slow down.

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,840
Okay.

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,040
I...

7
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,560
I have a bit of a trauma with cars

8
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,080
because of my mom's accident.

9
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,920
Sorry.

10
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,400
It's not your fault.

11
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,040
I thought it'd get better as I grew up,

12
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,800
but it has never changed.

13
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,880
Cheng Yu.

14
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,840
Do you want to

15
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,240
try to make a change?

16
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,600
How?

17
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,800
Actually, I had similar experiences.

18
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,480
But I think

19
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,480
only by facing fear

20
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,640
can we overcome fear.

21
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,000
Want to give it a try?

22
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,560
I...

23
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:11,560
Can I?

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,840
Of course.

25
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,640
You are Ms. Cheng.

26
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,680
Fine.

The marriage alliance

is their kind offer,

55
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,520
and Lin Shu is very proactive.

56
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,960
Why can't you be cooperative?

57
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,120
I didn't agree

58
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,800
to this marriage alliance.

59
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,120
Well,

60
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,560
listen, I only love Cheng Yu.

00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,080
Watch your attitude.

00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,320
You still can't let go of that vixen.

63
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,840
You let that vixen's family

64
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,040
take so much from us.

65
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,760
Her name is Cheng Yu.

66
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,320
Idiot!

67
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,280
Don't help him!

68
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,400
Get lost!

69
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,400
You're getting bolder.

70
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,280
Do you think I was

71
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,480
too lenient with you?

72
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,760
Since my childhood,

73
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,140
have you ever shown mercy?

74
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,020
And you've never

75
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,160
treated me as your son.

76
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,920
I taught you

77
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,640
to hold on tightly

78
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,160
to important people and things!

79
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,200
What about you?

80
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
You've been controlled by a woman.

81
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,640
I wish

82
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,600
I never had you!

83
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,110
Don't think

84
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,380
I won't meddle in

85
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,400
and destroy Cheng Yu.

86
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,440
I can get Lucheng's project myself,

87
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,360
and we don't necessarily need
the Lin Family's support.

88
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,320
If you can get this project,

89
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,240
you'll be the executive director
of Wanchuan Group.

90
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,320
Besides,

91
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,240
you must stop Hongye Group's bidding.

92
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,200
I hope you can keep your word.

93
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,800
Shut down the food production line
of Hongye Group.

94
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,960
Don't tell Zhou Jin.

95
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,320
Here's the information of

96
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,200
the bidding.

97
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,040
You delivered it here in person.

98
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,160
It was because

99
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,480
I had a good reason to come.

100
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,480
I'm wondering

101
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,680
if Hongye Group is the only one

102
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,040
that got this special treatment.

103
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,400
Ms. Cheng, I have faith in you.

104
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,840
I hope you win the bid.

105
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,640
But it depends on your ability.

106
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,640
It's only been a few days,

107
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,840
and your words

108
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,320
are getting sweeter.

109
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,080
Okay, I'll take this.

110
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,000
If nothing else,

111
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:48,930
you can...

112
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,440
I'm tired from driving.

113
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,640
Can I take a break

114
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,480
here?

115
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,440
Sure.

116
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,040
After all, I always work alone.

117
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,840
Today, I'll experience

the joy of Mr. Liu.

119
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,800
You don't have a split-screen.

120
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,600
It's tiring to compare files.

121
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,840
I'll set it up for you.

122
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,220
You know how to do that?

123
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,690
Then help me out.

124
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:17,900
I don't know how to do it.

125
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,640
