3
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,240
Was Cheng Yu here?

4
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,630
How could I know?

5
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,150
However,

6
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,640
didn't you say

7
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,150
she was your woman?

8
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,160
Well,

9
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:04,630
did she escape?

10
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,240
Have some drinks.

11
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:51,810
You ran away.

12
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,630
Are you still scared of him?

13
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,580
I'm not scared.

14
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,010
I just wanted to see

15
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,360
if you would help me.

16
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,760
And you did.

17
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,240
It seems you've answered

18
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,190
my question.

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,840
Mr. Pei,

20
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,440
do you want to bet with me?

21
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,700
I bet

22
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,460
you'll continue helping me.

23
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,610
Ms. Cheng,

24
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,870
you're different from the rumors.

25
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,440
So,

26
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,900
what's our relationship now?

27
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,420
Don't you

28
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
have an answer?

29
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,460
What? I don't know.

30
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,740
Friends with benefits.

31
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,820
Mr. Pei, what do you think?

32
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,140
Same.

33
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,220
That's good.

34
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,420
I thought

35
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,460
you'd have

36
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,500
a passionate night.

37
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,780
It seems I overestimated you.

38
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,380
Let's talk business.

39
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,340
I don't think the rumors about her

40
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,620
are true.

41
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,620
And she approached me on purpose.

42
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,630
I want to know

43
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,660
what she's really up to.

44
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,380
(Zhou Jin)

45
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,900
(Zhou Jin)

46
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,820
Hello.

47
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,620
Come back early tonight.

48
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,750
I need to ask you something.

49
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,320
What is it?

50
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,740
Come here.

51
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,940
Where did you go last night?

52
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,460
Pei Zheng helped you

53
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,300
get in touch with
Bang Yun Group, right?

54
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,420
I should thank you

55
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,900
for pushing me to a dead end.

56
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,300
I don't want Hongye Group

57
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,380
to be ruined because of me.

58
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,220
Am I wrong?

59
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,700
I've told you

60
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,020
as long as you behave,

61
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,580
Hongye Group will be fine.

62
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,420
However,

63
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,820
who allowed you

64
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,300
to get so close to Pei Zheng?

65
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,420
I don't like

66
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,420
lifeless pets.

67
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,300
Your occasional defiance

68
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,420
makes me feel surprised

69
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,300
and intrigued.

70
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:25,780
Get off me.

71
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,540
But it doesn't mean

72
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,860
I can tolerate your betrayal.

73
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,460
I said, get off...

74
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,180
Why did you leave with Pei Zheng?

75
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,340
Was it for Hongye Group?

76
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,100
I've warmed you,

77
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,580
yet you betrayed me

78
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,500
so many times.

79
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,140
Do I really have to break your bones

80
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,500
to make you obey me?

81
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,860
Get off me!

82
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,340
It's your birthday.

83
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,040
Happy birthday.

84
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,360
Zhou Jin.

85
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,540
In the most hopeless

86
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,100
and loneliest days of my life,

87
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,420
you suddenly showed up.

88
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,940
Back then,

89
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,980
you were so amazing.

90
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,940
You were so kind.

91
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,940
Sir,

92
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,460
are you okay?

93
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,460
Your injury is very serious.

94
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,420
Oh, no. I must call an ambulance.

95
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,220
Are you okay?

96
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,980
I don't know how to deal with wounds.

97
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:03,940
Be patient.

98
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,980
They will arrive soon.

99
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,220
I'll stay here with you.

100
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,980
Thank you.

101
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,020
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

102
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,730
I'm Cheng Yu, the president's assistant

103
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,620
of Hongye Group.

104
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,400
Oh, it's you.

105
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,840
How's your hand?

106
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,660
- Much better.
- Good.

107
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,580
Listen,

108
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,860
when you go to the lake alone,

109
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,860
you must be careful.

110
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,780
Anything else?

111
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,860
We discussed this over the phone.

112
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,580
Here's my company's information.

113
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,460
Please take a look.

114
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,820
(Food Safety Management)

115
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,540
It's quite a lot,

116
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,540
so I made some annotations.

117
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,780
It's easier for you to read.

118
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,500
Okay, I will check it later.

119
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,020
You can leave.

120
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,140
I also brought

121
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,460
a cake from our company.

122
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,420
You can try it.

123
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,540
It's delicious.

124
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,700
I really hope

125
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,660
you can cooperate with us.

126
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,460
After all, fate brought us here.

127
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,860
Sorry, Ms. Cheng.

128
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,180
I don't eat sweets.

129
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,460
It's okay.

130
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,580
You can share it with your colleagues.

131
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,520
I'll bring you

132
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,620
something else next time.

133
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,580
We have all kinds of food products.

134
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,580
It's a deal then.

135
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,540
Goodbye.

136
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,900
Since my mother passed away,

137
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,780
no one has ever

138
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,990
celebrated my birthday.

139
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,420
Yes.

140
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,860
I'm just an illegitimate child.

141
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,940
Who would care about my birthday?

142
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,100
My mother and I

143
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,980
lived with Pei Zheng

144
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,420
and his mother.

145
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,620
I'm a joke.

146
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,860
I'm a mistake!

147
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,700
My father did marry my mom,

148
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,540
but he often

149
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,860
went out to have fun

150
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,780
with so many women!

151
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,820
My mother was depressed

152
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,940
and died early.

153
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,740
Was it all fake?

154
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,620
Cheng Yu.

155
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,140
Now I have you.

156
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,340
You're the only one I have!

157
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:30,900
Sorry.

158
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,020
Did I scare you?

159
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,860
But it's all because

160
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,500
I love you so much.

161
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,820
I've kept you

162
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,620
because I care about you.

163
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,140
I got engaged

164
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,660
only to

165
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,980
take over Wanchuan Group

166
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,980
and build a future

167
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,180
for you and Hongye Group.

168
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,220
I just want

169
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,900
you to always stay by my side.

170
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,820
Hongye Group,

171
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:00,940
Wanchuan Group,

172
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,500
even anything in this world.

173
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,900
As long as you want it,

174
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,780
I will get it for you.

175
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,900
Give me some time.

176
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,300
I'll be stronger.

177
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,500
Please believe me.

178
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,260
(Zhou Jin, the show is about to start.)
