3
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,280
GreenForest Group wouldn't

4
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,040
possible miss such a good opportunity.

5
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,200
What foolish thing have you done again?

6
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,120
Someone set me up.

7
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,560
Give me another chance.

8
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,880
I will figure it out.

9
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,200
If you can get the business district

10
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,560
in the south of the city,

11
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,880
I'll forgive you.

12
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,800
If you can't,

13
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,800
remember,

14
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,560
neither you nor Hongye Group
can get anything

15
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,000
from me.

16
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,320
I didn't know what you like,

17
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,480
so I asked them
to pack all the new designs.

18
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,320
Take a look.

19
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,000
Did you buy all these things

20
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,240
to make up for the last time?

21
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,680
It was my fault.

22
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,640
I was just too tired.

23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,160
You were right.

24
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,080
Now that we're engaged,

25
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,080
I should try to get along with you.

26
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,920
After all, we both

27
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,680
carry family missions.

28
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,240
I'm glad that you understand.

29
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,560
Now I've realized

30
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,000
love is not the most important
thing in my life.

31
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,920
Only by holding power and business

32
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,160
tightly in our own hands

33
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,160
can we reach our goals.

34
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,280
The new business district
in the south of the city

35
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,640
is invaluable.

36
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,040
I hope you can

37
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,080
work with us

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and win the bidding.

39
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,800
I'll check it later.

40
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,680
Let's eat together.

41
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,840
Cheng Yu?

42
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,680
Yes?

43
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,680
Do you like it?

44
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,200
It looks good.

45
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,120
I'll help you put it on.

46
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,280
Okay.

47
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,880
Look good?

48
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,000
Yes.

49
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,840
Dear Ms. Cheng,

50
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,960
if you accept the rabbit,
can you give me a title?

51
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,800
People usually give rings.

52
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,200
Who'd give a rabbit?

53
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,880
If you don't like it, I'll take it back.

54
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,760
I like it.

55
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,960
It matches perfectly
with the previous rabbit.

56
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,280
Then I'll take it as a yes.

57
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,000
I didn't say no.

58
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,840
Bye.

59
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,880
Jin.

60
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,560
Is this how you treat me to a meal?

61
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,160
Having a meal with you

62
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,160
is the best thing I can do.

63
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,400
But I heard

64
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,160
you used to have meals
with Cheng Yu every week.

65
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,040
You were quite patient with her.

66
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,160
Our relationship

67
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,760
is none of your concern.

68
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,200
But it seems she's

69
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,960
having a good time dating someone else.

70
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,720
Brother.

71
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,750
What a coincidence.

72
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,720
Cheng Yu.

73
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,510
Yes.

74
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,320
Jin treated me to a meal.

75
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,120
Why don't you join us?

76
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:08,720
Well...

77
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,480
We need to discuss work.

78
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,560
It's inappropriate.

79
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,600
Let's sit over there.

80
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,670
It's okay.

81
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,200
Ms. Lin kindly invited us,

82
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,480
so how can we reject her?

83
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,240
Enjoy your meal.

84
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,000
Brother,

85
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,400
isn't it inappropriate to stare at

86
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,720
someone else with your fiancee

87
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,720
by your side?

88
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,720
Who are you to judge me?

89
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,440
Don't you remember

90
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,400
the car accident?

91
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,000
I remember.

92
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,400
That was when

93
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,670
destiny brought

94
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,480
Cheng Yu and I together.

95
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,530
Cheng Yu,

96
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,680
why do you need
to discuss work with him?

97
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,520
Enough.

98
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,280
Now that we're here,
let's enjoy the meal

99
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,360
and put work aside.

100
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,480
Take it easy.

101
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,240
Yes, Cheng Yu.

102
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,880
Why do you have to work in a restaurant?

103
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,040
We'll discuss the same thing

104
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,560
as you and Mr. Zhou do.

105
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,920
In that case,

106
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,520
Jin and I

107
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,480
came here for a date.

108
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,560
You also...

109
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,600
That's right.

110
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,200
Jin,

111
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,240
look how relaxed your brother is.

112
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,520
Look at yourself.

113
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,920
You look so serious.

114
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,240
Come on,

115
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,480
try this.

116
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,000
Pei Zheng,

117
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,240
I don't like the food here.

118
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,200
Why don't we go somewhere else?

119
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,200
I agree.

120
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,600
I know a good restaurant.

121
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,960
We'll take our leave.

122
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,040
Enjoy your meal.

123
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,480
Cheng Yu.

124
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,360
Do you want to give up the project?

125
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,800
If you still want it,

126
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,480
then sit down.

127
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,680
I can help you get it.

128
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,600
Once it's done,

129
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,840
I'll make a public announcement

130
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,280
of our marriage.

131
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,320
Ms. Lin,

132
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,360
you're too impatient.

133
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,360
Only a stable marriage

134
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,120
can convince our partners

135
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,680
that we're not doing this for business,

136
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,480
which is good for

137
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,960
the development of both our families.

138
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,200
However,

139
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,680
I don't expect you

140
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,360
to act like a good husband.

141
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,850
You just need to

142
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,440
show up with me when necessary.

143
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,200
I can accept your relationship

144
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,560
with Cheng Yu.

145
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,720
I know

146
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,640
you're just having fun.

147
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,520
Shut up!

148
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,200
My relationship with her

149
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,240
is none of your business.

150
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,240
You're actually defending her.

151
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,040
Everyone in Jiangcheng knows

152
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,960
her nasty tricks.

153
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,280
I'm just stating the facts.

154
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,680
I'll remind you again

155
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,310
that this is

156
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,760
none of your business.

157
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,840
I'll also remind you

158
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,800
I am your fiancee.

159
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,240
Ms. Lin, it seems

160
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,040
you're quite forgetful.

161
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,120
It was Zhou Song
who set up this marriage.

162
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,720
Isn't he supposed to be

163
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,240
your fiance?

164
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,450
Or should I call you

165
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,240
stepmother?

166
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,360
Do you want me
to cancel the engagement?

167
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,680
No way!

168
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,440
Thanks to Lin Group,

169
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,400
you've got so many

170
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,520
connections and benefits.

171
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,440
The project has just begun.

172
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,040
If I don't help you,

173
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,640
can you

174
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,360
handle it alone?

175
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,360
I'm quite curious

176
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,960
about your choice.
