00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:54,510
Old man.

4
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,680
Zheng?

5
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,710
Why did you come so quickly?

6
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,190
It's much faster than I expected.

7
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,120
Yu!

8
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:09,470
What's wrong?

9
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,950
Bang Yun Group terminated
the cooperation between us.

10
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,830
Our contract has been approved,

11
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,440
and we're making the products,

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,080
but the money is gone.

13
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,030
I just asked him.

14
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,040
He said it was over.

15
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,440
He won't fund us anymore.

16
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,520
What should we do now?

17
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,300
Well, this...

18
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,140
(Wanchuan Group Press Conference)

19
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,480
Friends from the media, thank you

20
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,080
for coming to Wanchuan Group's

21
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,160
press conference.

22
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,310
Today, I'd like to introduce to you

23
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,160
the new heir

24
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,630
of Wanchuan Group,

25
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,470
Pei Zheng.

26
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,830
We'll fight together as father and son.

27
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,350
Is there anything you want to say
to the media?

28
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,440
Hello everyone, I'm Pei Zheng.

29
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,990
From now on, I'll...

30
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,800
I'll manage Wanchuan Group

31
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
with my father.

32
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,800
We'll value quality,

33
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,080
keep our word,

34
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,550
and serve the society.

35
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,680
Today, we have one more thing
to announce.

36
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,320
Maybe this can clear up your doubts.

37
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,710
The Business Marriage

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,190
between Wanchuan Group and Lin Group

39
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,550
won't be canceled.

40
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,080
Shu, please stand up.

41
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:51,670
Zheng.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,840
Zheng?

43
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,780
So, now

44
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,780
I announce that Lin Shu and Pei Zheng

45
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,340
are engaged.

46
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,100
As the heir,

47
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,540
you need to fulfill your duty.

48
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,780
Don't be surprised.

49
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,820
Great!

50
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,930
What a perfect match!

51
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,220
Aren't they a perfect match?

52
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,960
Make sure Ms. Lin
looks good in the photos.

53
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,460
Why didn't you discuss it with me?

54
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,420
Back then,

55
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,340
the agreement between the two families

56
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,380
was about the heir's marriage.

57
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,340
Pei Zheng, don't be so angry.

58
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,140
It's just a business marriage.

59
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,060
We can still have fun
after getting married.

60
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,020
We only need to
show up together on certain occasions

61
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,420
and work together

62
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,020
in certain projects.

63
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,180
Did you hear that?

64
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,380
Shu is a smart person.

65
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,580
You should learn from her.

66
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,420
The future of Wanchuan Group

67
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,860
relies on the Lin Family.

68
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,780
Cheng Yu,

69
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,780
listen to me.

70
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,460
Alright, then tell me,

71
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,380
why did you return to the Zhou Family

72
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,660
and get engaged with Lin Shu?

73
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,260
What about me?

74
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,180
I have to go back and take over

75
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,020
Wanchuan Group

76
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,540
to save Hongye Group and Shenghua Group.

77
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,820
This is the best solution.

78
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,540
You could have just told me!

79
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,420
We agreed

80
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,780
to be honest with each other.

81
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,940
Look what you did.

82
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,820
I really didn't know
about the engagement!

83
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,820
You didn't know?

84
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,180
Then what about going back
to be the heir?

85
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,990
Were you completely unaware of that too?

86
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:48,700
♪Missing some subtle details♪

87
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,060
You've chosen to return
to the Zhou Family,

88
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,940
haven't you?

89
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,620
Then I'll tell you my choice.

90
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,020
Let's break up.

91
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:07,700
♪Why is it always so close♪

92
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,380
♪She'll find out♪

93
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,970
♪My love is still passionate and resolute♪

94
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,300
Why are you here?

95
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,060
When you were with me,

96
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,780
you'd only taste wine

97
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,900
instead of getting drunk.

98
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,340
That's right.

99
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,780
You've always liked spying on me.

100
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,060
Today, Pei Zheng
humiliated you in public.

101
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,580
How could I not worry about you?

102
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,700
Are you really not going to say hello?

103
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,860
No need.

104
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,980
After all, she is your ex-girlfriend.

105
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,260
Is it necessary to make it so awkward?

106
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,660
I'm the heir of Wanchuan Group.

107
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,940
As long as you are honest with me,

108
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,660
I'll do my best to cooperate.

109
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,020
But if you set me up,

110
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,780
I won't go easy on you.

111
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,100
Very good.

112
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,580
You deserve to be my man.

113
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,740
They are a good match.

114
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,340
If you want to laugh at me,

115
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,860
you should've had enough.

116
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,460
Cheng Yu,

117
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,300
this is the price of disobeying me.

118
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,620
I was right.

119
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,060
Pei Zheng has planned

120
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,020
to return to the Zhou Family.

121
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,700
Then he got engaged with Lin Shu.

122
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,700
He's the real

123
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,540
cunning man

124
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,540
and hypocrite.

125
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,460
I've told you

126
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,460
about his true colors.

127
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,300
In his eyes,

128
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,500
family and love

129
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,420
are nothing but tools.

130
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,780
Pei Zheng is trash,

131
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,980
but so are you.

132
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,420
If insulting me

133
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,940
can make you feel a bit better,

134
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,420
then go ahead.

135
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,180
Cheng Yu,

136
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,700
I admit I don't

137
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,540
understand love.

138
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:01,940
However,

139
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,220
if you give me another chance,

140
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,940
I'll change everything
you dislike about me.

141
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,300
I swear.

142
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,300
You're so funny.

143
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,820
You two are complete trash.

144
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,660
Well,

145
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,980
do I have to find a man
in the trash heap?

146
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,900
Wait.

147
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:21,940
Brother,

148
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,380
now I'm with her.

149
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,860
Do you have a problem?
