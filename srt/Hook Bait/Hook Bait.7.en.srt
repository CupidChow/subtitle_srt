00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,400
Why don't we use this opportunity

4
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,040
to get to know each other better?

5
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,420
Enough.

6
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,260
Do not do this again.

7
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,020
It'll only make me feel disgusted.

00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,660
(Hongye Group Bidding Plan)
Today, I want to

9
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,980
tell you guys

10
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,060
that I've decided to

11
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,260
participate in the bidding
for Bang Yun Group's Joint Game.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,980
Bidding?

13
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,780
We've all witnessed

14
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,300
the development of our company.

15
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,820
We've made some progress,

16
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,020
but we need to focus on
the basic needs first, right?

17
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:41,820
And?

18
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,740
Should we just sit and wait for death?

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,980
You've dictated to us for many years

20
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,820
just because you can please Zhou Jin.

21
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,660
My leadership

22
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,380
has nothing to do with Zhou Jin.

23
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,900
I rotated positions for four years

24
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,700
to get to this place.

25
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,980
Every year,

26
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,860
I give you a year-end bonus

27
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,460
twice that of our peers.

28
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,860
We must sign up

29
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,340
for the bidding.

30
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,620
A few days ago,

31
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,260
Wanchuan Group stopped

32
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,340
funding our R&D Department.

33
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,500
Do you think this project

34
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,420
can proceed

35
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,100
without Zhou Jin's funds?

36
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,380
It's true.

37
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,460
I forgot to tell you.

38
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,020
Impressive.

39
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,220
You didn't know

40
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,020
the situation until now.

41
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,580
I'll solve the money problem.

42
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,860
Just focus on your work

43
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,580
and product R&D.

44
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,780
The R&D and promotion

45
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,700
of the new product

46
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,580
needs 20 million yuan.

47
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,980
How can you get the money?

48
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,540
Besides, we don't have time.

49
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,300
If you need fonds,

50
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,900
you can consider using connections.

51
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,060
One week.

52
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,540
I will get the money in one week.

53
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,060
You only need to focus on your work.

54
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,500
I don't want to hear any doubts

55
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,380
about my decision.

56
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,260
Otherwise,

57
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,580
you'll be fired!

58
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,310
Why didn't you come to me

59
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,730
when Hongye Group was in trouble?

60
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,460
At that time, my father

61
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,630
sought help from Wanchuan Group.

62
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,530
Under its control,

63
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,760
it was hard for us

64
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,420
to seek help from others.

65
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:18,900
That's right.

66
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,900
By the time I knew it,

67
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,180
it had been too late.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,020
So, what brings

69
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,220
you here?

70
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,190
I...

71
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,340
Actually, I want to borrow

72
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,580
some money from you.

73
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,180
Here is our information.

74
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,340
Is it too abrupt?

75
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,460
After your mother died,

76
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,780
your father took over the company.

77
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,180
He is

78
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,980
a short-sighted man

79
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,100
who only cares about immediate benefits

80
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,100
and can't achieve anything big.

81
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,620
To be honest,

82
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,100
I don't have to

83
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,900
lend you money.

84
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,340
Yu,

85
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,620
if I say no,

86
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,100
what will you do?

87
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,940
You will lend me money.

88
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,900
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
agreed to see me.

89
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,700
Good one, Yu.

90
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,780
Okay.

91
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,460
I'll get to the point.

92
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,380
All businessmen

93
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,420
prioritize profit.

94
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,560
GreenForest Group

95
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,340
has 500 large supermarkets that can

96
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,820
provide distribution services.

97
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,140
I want the exclusive sales rights.

98
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,860
Of course,

99
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,700
I really hope

100
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,260
you can cooperate with Bang Yun Group.

101
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,980
If not, it's okay.

102
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,940
I will lend you the money,

103
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,340
but you must pay it back double.

104
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,460
Okay.

105
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,500
I accept your terms.

106
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,580
I'll try my best to get
Bang Yun Group's project.

107
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,900
Then I'll congratulate you in advance.

108
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,100
Yu.

109
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,340
We're hosting
an internal business conference.

110
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,340
The luncheon is about to start.

111
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,220
Many big figures

112
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,540
in the industry will come.

113
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,020
Do you want to meet them?

114
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,180
Sure. Thank you, Mr. Chen.

115
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,780
Still Mr. Chen?

116
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,180
Just call me Uncle.

117
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,580
Thank you, Uncle Chen.

118
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,300
- I'll head over.
- Okay.

119
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,820
Goodbye, Uncle Chen.

120
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,640
Is this how you want me

121
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,260
to return your favor?

122
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,620
(GreenForest Group
Business Exchange Conference)

123
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,540
(Bang Yun Group, Pei Zheng)

124
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,350
Pei Zheng?

125
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,640
What's your relationship with her?

126
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,180
This depends on

127
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,940
whether she has the ability or not.

128
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:14,860
Moreover,

129
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,100
she had to get your approval first.

130
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,620
If you didn't agree, I wouldn't lend it.

131
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:19,980
However,

132
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,540
I need you to hand over

133
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,260
the money for me.

134
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,220
You have the money,

135
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,940
so why don't you
lend it to her yourself?

136
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,020
Why do you need my help?

137
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,620
Mr. Chen, you're a smart person,

138
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,380
I'm sure you can figure it out.

139
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,100
If I transfer the money to her,

140
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,700
people will think

141
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,220
GreenForest Group
thinks highly of Hongye Group.

142
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,940
Pei Zheng, you're up to something else.

143
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,980
- Mr. Wei.
- Mr. Chen.

144
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,100
- Hello, Mr. Pei.
- Pei Zheng.

145
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,580
Hello, Mr. Pei.

146
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,500
How have you been?

147
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:04,890
I've been good.

148
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,380
Excuse me.

149
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,420
Okay, go ahead.

150
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,700
How's your new project going?

151
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,900
What's on your mind?

152
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,980
Mr. Pei, you're also here.

153
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,300
Thank you for telling me

154
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,300
to ask Uncle Chen.

155
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,420
He agreed to help me.

156
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,900
I'm really impressed.

157
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,980
Cheers?

158
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,620
Mr. Chen.

159
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,580
It seems I don't need to introduce you.

160
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,540
Yu is the most important guest.

161
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,900
Take good care of her.

162
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,380
Okay, don't worry.

163
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,700
Mr. Liu.

164
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,100
- Mr. Chen, long time no see.
- Welcome.

165
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,060
Hello, Mr. Chen.

166
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,940
Welcome.

167
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,060
Let's continue our cooperation.

168
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,540
Absolutely. Cheers.

169
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,740
He is a businessman.

170
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,700
If you can't give him what he wants,

171
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,220
no one can help you.

172
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,940
Why do you look so worried?

173
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,900
Come on, let's take a break.

174
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,350
Our company

175
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,700
developed a racing game.

176
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,020
I need inspiration.

177
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,460
I can't drive!

178
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,620
But I can.

179
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,540
Come on, get in the car.

180
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,260
Mr. Pei, I didn't know

181
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,500
you usually drive a sports car.

182
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,980
You don't know me well enough.

183
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,540
Ms. Cheng, would you like
to go for a ride?

184
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,510
Go for a ride?

185
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,090
Sure.

186
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,100
Let's go.

187
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,030
Get in the car.
