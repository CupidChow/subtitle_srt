=Episode 3=

3
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,800
Hurry up and pick me up.

4
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,320
I...

5
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,520
Where are you going?

6
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,400
Hello, Ms. Cheng?

7
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,790
Ms. Cheng?

8
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,140
Take off your clothes.

9
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,720
Are you crazy, Zhou Jin?

10
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,560
Go away!

11
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,620
Was it thrilling
to make out with my brother?

12
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,500
You threw away the dress,

13
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,100
held his waist,

14
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,340
and flirted with him.

15
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,380
Cheng Yu,

16
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,180
I can't accept any of this!

17
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,220
So, show me

18
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,500
how you seduced

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,660
and flirted with him!

20
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,980
Zhou Jin, get off me!

21
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,340
Don't touch me!

22
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,060
Zhou Jin, you pervert!

23
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,940
You even hooked up with

24
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,140
my brother.

25
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,820
Have you no shame?

26
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,460
How dare you act innocent

27
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,420
in front of me?

28
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,700
It seems you haven't

29
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,460
got enough reward last night.

30
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,740
Or

31
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,220
do you want to try again

32
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,820
just as I want to?

33
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:34,820
Zhou Jin,

34
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,940
if you have the guts, kill me.

35
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,940
Otherwise,

36
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,620
I'll do it again.

37
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,460
What a tough girl.

38
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,580
Since you are so disobedient,

39
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,860
I can only break your arms and legs

40
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,500
and lock you by my side.

41
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,580
Zhou Jin, you...

42
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,020
Get off me!

43
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:07,980
Go away!

44
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,540
Brother, I've never

45
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,780
seen you like this before.

46
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,820
Did I disturb you?

47
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,620
None of your business.

48
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,940
Pei Zheng,

49
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,460
I don't know

50
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,300
and don't care

51
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,860
why you came back.

52
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,700
But I'm warning you,

53
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,140
stay away

54
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,180
from my things.

55
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,340
Your things?

56
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,940
It seems they didn't teach you well.

57
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,220
She is a person,

58
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,420
not a thing.

59
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,340
What are you doing?

60
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,220
Ms. Cheng, let's go.

61
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,490
Come on, hurry up.

62
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,820
Pei.

63
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,340
Your brother bullied a woman.

64
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,420
Shame on him.

65
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,660
It's my fault.

66
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,700
I didn't teach him well.

67
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,100
Let's go back

68
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,700
to the old house.

69
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,170
The engagement banquet isn't over.

70
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,790
How could you escape

71
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,900
and leave Lin Shu alone?

72
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,940
Do you know
how many relatives and friends

73
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,180
I invited

74
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,220
for your engagement banquet?

75
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,860
You embarrassed our family!

76
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,140
I'm leaving.

77
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:24,980
Wait.

78
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,620
What I told you earlier

79
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,780
was not a joke.

80
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,700
What's the point of

81
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,460
being someone else's assistant?

82
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,860
You should come back

83
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,700
and help Jin.

84
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,140
No need.

85
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,580
I can spend my own money.

86
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,660
I feel happy.

87
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,380
Get lost.

88
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,700
You're always pissing me off.

89
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,260
He...

90
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,740
His surname is Pei.

91
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,500
It's not your turn to speak!

92
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,700
It isn't over.

93
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,580
How dare you argue?

94
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,620
Shut up!

95
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,420
Shut up!

96
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,380
Shut up!

97
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,620
Do you dare to argue again?

98
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,740
Mr. Zhou, do you need to
see a doctor?

99
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,820
No need.

100
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,860
Where's Cheng Yu?

101
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,060
Ms. Cheng

102
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,380
is preparing for
the Brand Exchange Meeting.

103
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,420
She hasn't returned home.

104
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,900
No company is allowed

105
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,300
to collaborate with Hongye Group.

106
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,340
You know what to do.

107
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,420
(Cheng Yu)

108
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,900
(How dare you defy me again and again?)

109
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,420
(I will destroy all your paths)

110
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,940
(and make you beg me!)

111
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,500
(Jiangcheng Brand Exchange Meeting,
Meet, Foresee, Brand Exchange)

112
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,380
These suppliers

113
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,860
treated me like an escort.

114
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,420
They refused to talk about business.

115
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,980
I faced the same situation.

116
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,300
Zhou Jin. Did he warm them?

117
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,380
Of course.

118
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,060
That's the method he uses to tame me.

119
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,820
So nasty!

120
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,740
Maybe we should take a chance

121
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,260
on Bang Yun Game.

122
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,620
(Bang Yun Co., Ltd.)

123
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,180
(Meeting Room No. 9)
Which company?

124
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,340
Hongye Group.

125
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,100
Sorry, you're not on the list.

126
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,940
You can't go in.

127
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,100
What should we do?

128
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,850
Without an invitation, we can't get in.

129
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,860
Isn't this Ms. Cheng?

130
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,920
Why aren't you going in?

131
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,580
Wasn't

132
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,980
you invited?

133
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,340
I'll take you in.

134
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,500
Come on.

135
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,380
Come on.

136
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,220
Mr. Liu!

137
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,940
Dear Mr. Liu.

138
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,580
Oh, let me introduce her.

139
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,540
(Why is he here?)

140
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,700
This is Ms. Cheng from Hongye Group.

141
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,340
She also wants to get an opportunity.

142
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,180
Mr. Qiu, you're so generous.

143
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,380
You're helping your competitor.

144
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,420
Mr. Liu, Changlong Group
has a solid foundation.

145
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,620
I'm not afraid of competing with others.

146
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,460
Okay.

147
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,020
Let's listen to

148
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,900
Hongye Group's introduction.

149
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,740
Okay.

150
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,860
Go ahead.

151
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,300
Mr. Liu,

152
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,580
I'm not bragging.

153
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,180
This is definitely the best Corn Crisps

154
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,980
I've ever eaten.

155
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,620
And we also provide toys.

156
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,540
Ugly but adorable Screaming Chicken.

157
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,980
You begged me humbly

158
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,020
to bring you in,

159
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,380
and this is the thing

160
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,300
you want to sell?

161
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,900
Try it.

162
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,740
Come on.

163
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,420
Mind your own business.

164
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,780
Bang Yun Game is a rising star,

165
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,180
but it has always lacked
a like-minded partner

166
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,220
in co-branded business.

167
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,540
Hongye Group

168
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,980
has many young people,

169
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,020
and the snack blind box business

170
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,220
has seen a continuous rise in sales.

171
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,260
Therefore, I believe Hongye Group

172
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,540
is your best choice.

173
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,180
Stop bragging here.

174
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,020
Get out.

175
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,980
Get out.

176
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,020
Mr. Liu always says

177
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,060
Bang Yun Group

178
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,940
welcomes voices from all sectors.

179
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,340
Ms. Cheng's criticism and wisdom

180
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,700
are exactly what we need.

181
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,780
My assistant is right.

182
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,460
Ms. Cheng,

183
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,600
let's discuss the details later.

184
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,340
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

185
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,700
What?

186
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,660
It's unbelievable.

187
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,820
It turns out that the man
who fought alongside me

188
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,620
is the assistant of Bang Yun Group.

189
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,740
If you'd told me earlier
that you knew a big figure,

190
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,940
it would've been much easier.

191
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,080
You... You can go back.

192
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,460
Mr. Pei!

193
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,500
What's wrong, Ms. Cheng?

194
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,180
Thank you.

195
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,380
Not a big deal.

196
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,980
If you have time,

197
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,420
shall we have a drink tonight?

198
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,460
Sorry for the wait.

199
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,980
Whiskey, please.

200
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,780
Sorry for what happened earlier.

201
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,500
I wanted to tell him

202
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,060
he shouldn't have

203
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,180
treated his girlfriend like that.

204
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,580
Girlfriend?

205
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,100
We're definitely not in a relationship.

206
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,300
We're not even friends.

207
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,420
Mr. Pei,

208
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,900
you're so concerned
about our relationship.

209
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,460
Is it because of me or him?

210
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,220
What do you think?

211
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,860
I have no idea, Mr. Pei.
