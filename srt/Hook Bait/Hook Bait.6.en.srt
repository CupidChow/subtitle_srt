=Episode 6=

3
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,750
I'll teach Jin

4
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,430
a lesson.

5
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,530
Don't worry.

6
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,490
I'll never

7
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,490
let anyone bully you.

8
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,940
Don't worry, Shu.

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,520
Mr. Zhou,

10
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,310
to be honest, our family

11
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,590
chose your family

12
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,040
because we all think highly of Jin.

13
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,790
But now, someone doesn't know

14
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,750
her place and is making trouble.

15
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,400
If this continues,

16
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,630
I don't know how long I can hold on.

17
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,900
During Zhou Jin's business trip,

18
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:18,840
don't let him get

19
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:19,720
in touch with Cheng Yu.

20
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,740
Besides, stop funding Hongye Group.

21
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,190
Don't tell Zhou Jin.

22
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,180
This is a guide for the area nearby.

23
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,330
I've made some notes. Look.

24
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,580
This one is called Happy Bar.

25
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,020
You can go there when you're down.

26
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,500
And the Ground Pot Chicken

27
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,700
and barbecue

28
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,780
are very delicious.

29
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,420
Thank you, Chen Xu.

30
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,020
You're so thoughtful.

31
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,060
You're welcome.

32
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,380
Just consider this

33
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,900
an apology for spying on you.

34
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,180
I had to follow my brother's order,

35
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,020
but I'm loyal to the company.

36
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,670
I know.

37
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,300
It's okay. It's in the past.

38
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,420
This rabbit is so cute.

39
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,860
But why does it look

40
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,140
older than me?

41
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,500
My benefactor gave me this rabbit.

42
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,100
It's been 20 years.

43
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,980
20 years?

44
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,620
No wonder it looks

45
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,860
a bit old.

46
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,620
Okay, Yu, I'll go upstairs.

47
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,140
Go ahead.

48
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,020
Hello.

49
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,380
Settled?

50
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,260
Yes.

51
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,740
With Chen Xu's help,

52
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,100
I tidied it up quickly.

53
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,980
Did Zhou Jin

54
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,820
have a problem with this?

55
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,100
He's on a business trip,

56
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,660
and we had a deal.

57
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,980
When he returns,
he won't be able to control me.

58
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,340
Good.

59
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,740
You've helped me so many times.

60
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,660
I'll treat you to a meal

61
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,020
when you have time.

62
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,860
How about now?

63
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,220
I'll go to your place.

64
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,180
Okay.

65
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,340
Meet him.

66
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,780
Shu went to the south of the city.

67
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,140
Take care of her.

68
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,820
Got it.

69
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,460
You should know the power

70
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,500
of the Lin Family.

71
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,340
Have a child with Lin Shu.

72
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,820
You should hook up with more rich women

73
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:23,900
so that

74
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,460
you can have more children.

75
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,340
You...

76
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,020
Brother?

77
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,500
You're so quick.

78
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,860
You're having Western food.

79
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,500
Yu prepared this

80
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,780
just for you.

81
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,980
And a steak.

82
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,340
- Really?
- Wait here. I'll go get it.

83
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,940
Bang Yun Group

84
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,420
is about to launch a joint tender

85
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,700
for the new game,

86
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,020
and Changlong Group is in.

87
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,060
What about you?

88
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,820
We?

89
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,580
Can we do it?

90
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,260
Your speech was impressive.

91
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,180
Were you bragging?

92
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,420
Of course not.

93
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,500
However,

94
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,660
Hongye Group hasn't participated

95
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,140
in any bidding for a long time.

96
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,980
It's all about human effort.

97
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,300
If you want

98
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,260
to completely break free

99
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,300
from the control of Zhou Jin
and Wanchuan Group,

100
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,900
bidding will be the best choice.

101
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,820
Yes, it makes sense.

102
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,460
Then we'll get prepared

103
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,700
and give it a try.

104
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,220
I'm just a small assistant,

105
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,580
but Mr. Liu trusts me.

106
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,220
So, do you need any help?

107
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,300
I can tell he trusts you,

108
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,940
but it's inappropriate to cheat.

109
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,820
We'll win with our ability.

110
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,100
Product R&D requires a lot of funds.

111
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,580
During the meeting, I heard

112
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,900
your company had very few orders

113
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,260
and was poorly managed.

114
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,900
Is Wanchuan Group

115
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,500
the only investor?

116
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,100
Yes.

117
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,420
Our current orders rely on

118
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,140
Zhou Jin and Wanchuan Group.

119
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,300
However,

120
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,020
I have to learn to rely on myself.

121
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,660
If you need funds,

122
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,380
you can consider using connections,

123
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,740
such as

124
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,380
Mr. Chen from GreenForest Group.

125
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,740
(Uncle Chen?)

126
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,820
Okay, I will keep that in mind.

127
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,660
Brother, Changlong Group

128
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,100
is no match for us.

129
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,500
We'll impress everyone.
Just wait and see.

130
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,500
Let's eat.

131
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,780
Okay.

132
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,140
If I want to

133
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,900
often come here to have meals,

134
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,220
do you mind?

135
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,700
It's because my sister lives here.

136
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,820
Nothing else.

137
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,340
I didn't imply anything else.

138
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,820
Jin,

139
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,300
you're back.

140
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,530
I know we agreed

141
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,140
not to interfere in each other's lives,

142
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,460
but I really

143
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,700
like you.

144
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,620
I came here

145
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,700
and arranged all this.

146
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:54,980
Why don't we

147
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,180
use this opportunity

148
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,900
to get to know each other better?
