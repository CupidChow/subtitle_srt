3
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,150
This card has no limit.

4
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,450
The code is your birthday.

5
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,320
Remember,

6
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,420
money can solve

7
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,400
most problems.

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,080
There are many Chinese in Singapore,

9
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,600
but they have different bans.

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,960
Therefore, I asked a friend in Singapore

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,200
to accompany you the whole time.

12
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,000
Okay.

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,800
But actually, I'm still thinking about
whether I should go.

14
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,560
Well, Wanchuan Group's issues
are not over.

15
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,680
If anything happens,

16
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,080
I'll be so worried.

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,280
Don't worry.

18
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,920
Liu Yu is with me.

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,120
You've strived for this for a long time,

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,200
so don't give up.

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,280
But if anything happens,

22
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,320
how can I focus on work?

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,720
Nothing will happen.

24
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,480
Let's not make assumptions

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,600
about things that haven't happened.

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,360
You should think about
how to present your products

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,760
at the exhibition.

28
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,600
There's indeed something important.

29
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
When will you

30
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,440
move into my place?

31
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,040
Let's talk about it later.

32
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,080
Chen Xu and I

33
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,200
are having a good time.

34
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,440
Really?

35
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,080
After you move in,

36
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,280
we can drive out for fun

37
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,760
and go to work together.

38
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,280
In the evenings,

39
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,080
we can lean on the sofa,

40
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,080
watch movies,

41
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,520
and have some drinks.

42
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,120
Sounds pretty nice.

43
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,840
Will that happen?

44
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,680
Of course.

45
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,240
When this is over,

46
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,240
our companies will get better,

47
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,840
and so will our lives.

48
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,800
But there's one more thing.

49
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,880
Don't get drunk,

50
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,000
or you might lose control.

51
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,960
What are you talking about?

52
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,120
When did I lose control
after getting drunk?

53
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,800
Now you're doing this to me.

54
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,160
Fine.

55
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,920
I'll pack my stuff now.

56
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,640
I don't have time to talk.

57
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,560
I'll teach you a lesson

58
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,400
when I come back with good news.

59
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,600
Let me do it.

60
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,040
It's such a late flight.

61
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,160
It'll rain tonight.

62
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,520
Will the plane take off on schedule?

63
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,480
I think so.

64
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,400
Zhao Yong is waiting.

65
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,320
You can get back to work.

66
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,960
Pei, we've cracked the password.

67
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,120
The information is very complete.

68
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,640
Okay, I'm coming.

69
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,000
Zheng, where is Yu?

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,320
Is she still doing her makeup?

71
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,840
Didn't she go downstairs?

72
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,160
Downstairs?

73
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,840
No one was there.

74
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,600
Zhou Jin, what do you want?

75
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,440
What do I want?

76
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,880
Marry me.

77
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,480
Witnessed by heaven and earth,

78
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,200
we...

79
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,160
we'll become husband and wife.

80
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,040
You are so ridiculous.

81
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,160
Even if I were to die,

82
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,160
I would never...

83
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,720
How could I let you die?

84
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,840
How could I bear to let you die?

85
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,200
You're the canary I've raised.

86
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,600
If my canary were to lose its wings,

87
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,680
I would have to clean you up

88
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,160
and dress you up

89
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,440
with my own hands.

90
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,000
You can only be mine.

91
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,400
I'm so happy.

92
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,920
I have great skills.

93
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,640
What are you doing, Zhou Jin?

94
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,120
Zhou Jin, what are you going to do?

95
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,680
I wonder

96
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,560
if it'll hurt.

97
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,000
Get off me, Zhou Jin.

98
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,120
You're insane!

99
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,400
Get off me!

100
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,960
Get off me!

101
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,480
Cheng Yu!

102
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,200
Are you okay?

103
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:55,700
Pei Zheng!

104
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,700
She is mine.

105
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,320
Don't you dare take her away!

106
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,600
Zhou Jin,

107
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,520
look what you've become!

108
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,920
I lost my mind a long time ago.

109
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,080
Ever since she left me,

110
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,920
I've been crazy!

111
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,240
Or what?

112
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,120
How did you treat her?

113
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,240
Do you expect her to be grateful?

114
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,560
I can't lose her!

115
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,080
She is mine.

116
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,080
She can only be mine!

117
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,320
Zhou Jin,

118
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,240
stop being so stubborn

119
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,710
and imposing your pain

120
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,400
on others.

121
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,720
I've lost everything.

122
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,160
I'd rather die

123
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,680
than live in disgrace!

124
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,670
Pei Zheng!

125
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,320
Stop fighting!

126
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,680
Untie me!

127
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,560
Calm down, both of you!

128
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,400
Cheng Yu!

129
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,200
I will never forget

130
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,520
the day we met.

131
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,120
You saved me

132
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,120
and gave me warmth.

133
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,640
I've always lived in the dark.

134
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,120
How could I let go of my only light?

135
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,680
Zhou Jin.

136
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,090
Don't flatter yourself.

137
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,620
I really wish I had never met you.

138
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,000
You hate Zhou Song.

139
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,680
But you're the same as him!

140
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,480
You hate him, yet you've become

141
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,680
another version of him!

142
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm different!

143
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,720
He treated me like that

144
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,280
only to use me.

145
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,680
But all I did to you

146
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,880
was out of love!

147
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,960
You know nothing about love!
