(Engagement Banquet,
Zhou Jin & Lin Shu)

4
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,940
Isn't this the engagement banquet
of Mr. Zhou and Ms. Lin?

5
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,140
- Why is she here?
- Exactly.

6
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,100
Aren't they ashamed of this love affair?

7
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,020
Stop talking.

8
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,180
Congratulations, Mr. Zhou.

9
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,460
Stay where you are.

10
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,380
You know the

11
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,980
consequences of running away.

12
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:02,740
Is he crazy?

13
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,740
It's his engagement day,

14
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,740
and he made you wear this.

15
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,020
Let's go.

16
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,860
Ms. Cheng, it's you.

17
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,100
You dressed like this,

18
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:14,940
and I thought

19
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,340
you were Ms. Lin.

20
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,360
You're angry about it and want

21
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,220
to make a scene, right?

22
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,100
- None of your business.
- I can understand.

23
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,340
- Shut up.
- Bye.

24
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,860
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

25
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,060
Jin.

26
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,300
Dad.

27
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,740
Mr. Zhou is here.

28
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,300
Jin,

29
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,940
how could you be late for this?

30
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,700
Why didn't you pick up Shu?

31
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,380
You're so rude.

32
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:40,740
It's okay.

33
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,910
I came early to talk

34
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,980
about business with you.

35
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,260
Isn't that quite good?

36
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,460
No wonder Shu is

37
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,140
the heiress of Lin Group.

38
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,620
From now on,

39
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,650
Jin and you

40
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,940
will manage Wanchuan Group

41
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,820
together.

42
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,860
Mr. Zhou, don't worry.

43
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,300
I will do my best.

44
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,460
Okay.

45
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,580
Have a seat.

46
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,420
Dad, I'll greet the guests first.

47
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,340
Okay, go ahead.

48
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,460
Have a seat.

49
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,860
I know you want to break free
from his control,

50
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,290
but he's so...

51
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,820
Stop. Give me the thing I asked.

52
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,860
Oh, right. Why do you need
this black dress?

53
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,020
Well, I'll...

54
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,860
wear it.

55
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,980
This... This is the Ladies' Room.

56
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,820
(Restroom)

57
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,860
Do you need help?

58
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,220
Sure.

59
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,900
Then...

60
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,740
can you help me button this?

61
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,820
Did he do this to you?

62
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,460
It's okay.

63
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,820
You don't need to talk.

64
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,820
I crossed the line.

65
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,500
You've been away
from your family for so long

66
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,500
that you don't know
your brother anymore.

67
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,540
We are half-siblings.

68
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,100
It's normal that I don't know him well.

69
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,900
However, Ms. Cheng,

70
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,340
rumor has it

71
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,500
that you're his favorite secret lover.

72
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,980
Secret lover?

73
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,340
If I had to choose a lover

74
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,860
between you and your brother...

75
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,020
then...

76
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,100
I'd definitely choose you.

77
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,460
Thanks.

78
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,380
(Maybe you're the best choice
to help me)

79
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,460
(get rid of Zhou Jin
and take back my company.)

80
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,820
(It seems I can't finish)

81
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,380
(this game without you.)

82
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,460
(She's taken the bait.)

83
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,340
Three,

84
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,980
two,

85
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,900
- Sister-in-law.
- one.

86
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,340
What's wrong?

87
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,580
Thank you.

88
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,660
I almost lost it.

89
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,620
It's a bit difficult to wear.

90
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,780
Can you

91
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,300
do me another favor?

92
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,980
Given our relationship,

93
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,580
isn't it inappropriate?

94
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,260
You already helped me once.

95
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,820
Why does it matter?

96
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,140
Mr. Zhou.

97
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,580
Where is Ms. Cheng?

98
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,700
She went to the restroom.

99
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,820
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

100
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,140
Okay.

101
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,180
Brother, I can't be found right now.

102
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,130
Help me.

103
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,640
How?

104
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,710
You're my sister-in-law.

105
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:54,860
Cheng Yu?

106
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,830
Haven't you seen enough?

107
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,260
Don't go too far.

108
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:45,980
Where are you?

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,940
It's about to start.

110
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,820
Coming.

111
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,300
Mr. Lin,

112
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,180
Mrs. Lin.

113
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,980
Are you satisfied with

114
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,380
today's arrangements?

115
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,380
This banquet is well organized.

116
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,380
Mr. Zhou, you invited all the prominent

117
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,780
business figures from Jiangcheng.

118
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,660
Wanchuan Group is impressive.

119
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,580
Compared to Lin Group,

120
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,060
it's not a big deal.

121
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,300
But we will try our best.

122
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,420
We want the entire Jiangcheng to know

123
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,060
it's not only

124
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,820
the engagement ceremony
of Jin and Shu,

125
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,820
but a big day for the alliance

126
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,460
between Wanchuan Group and Lin Group.

127
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,380
Okay.

128
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,420
Have a seat.

129
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,820
Old man,

130
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,020
you seem very satisfied with

131
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,540
the engagement banquet.

132
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,340
Mr. Lin,

133
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,860
this is Pei Zheng, my eldest son.

134
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,860
Zheng, you've had enough fun.

135
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,540
It's time to come back

136
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,660
and assist your brother

137
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,500
and his wife.

138
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,620
Jin has been managing

139
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,700
the group.

140
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,220
With the marriage alliance
with Lin Group,

141
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,380
he'll be more outstanding.

142
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,860
So, just go easy on me.

143
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,700
I'm doing well.

144
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:36,700
Please welcome Ms. Lin from Lin Group
and Mr. Zhou from Wanchuan Group!

145
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,340
It's a big day for the two families.

146
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,660
Do you want to see
Mr. Zhou kiss his fiancee?

147
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,460
Well, haven't you seen enough?

148
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,580
Applause!

149
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,460
My friends, another round of applause!

150
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,360
Okay.

151
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,300
Let's give a warm round of applause

152
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,660
to welcome this couple.
Please have a seat.

153
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:49,830
Jin,

154
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,300
I don't care about your past.

155
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,860
But from now on, only I can be

156
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,140
by your side.

157
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,380
Lin Shu,

158
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,460
this is just a business marriage.

159
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,380
Don't cross the line.

160
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,180
Hello, Zhao Yong.

161
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,580
I'm at the underground parking lot.

162
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,620
Where are you?

163
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,620
Hurry up and pick me up.

164
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,950
I...

165
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,260
Where are you going?
