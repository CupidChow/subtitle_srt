3
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,640
They collaborated before,

4
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,440
but it didn't work out

5
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,040
due to funding problems.

6
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,240
It's about what happened before.

7
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,920
What are you doing?

8
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,080
Hey, what are you looking at?

9
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,680
You even covered it up.

10
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,000
What are you hiding from me?

11
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,160
Nothing.

12
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,240
Mr. Pei,

13
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,080
I'll schedule the meeting
according to Beijing time.

14
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,120
Sorry for

15
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,360
the trouble.

16
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,760
Okay, Ms. Ye.

17
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,720
Talk to you next time.

18
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,400
Do you understand now?

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,840
I...

20
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,880
What should I understand?

21
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,360
Wait, you were talking to someone

22
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,800
in the middle of the night.

23
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,760
When I came over,

24
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,880
you even closed the screen.

25
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,920
How could I know

26
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,480
what you were doing?

27
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,960
Linghang Group requires
video conference.

28
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,960
Wait a minute.

29
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,920
Do you mean

30
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,160
the leading company in the world?

31
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,880
Ms. Ye's team

32
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,200
is skilled at

33
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,160
due diligence
for a group's previous projects.

34
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,160
They can make

35
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,400
the accounts of

36
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,520
Hongye Group,

37
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,280
Wanchuan Group, and Shenghua Group

38
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,360
more clear

39
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,160
so that I can make Mr. Chen satisfied

40
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,960
and continue to

41
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,120
work with him.

42
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,270
Thank you.

43
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,320
You're amazing!

44
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,720
A small company like Hongye Group

45
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,840
couldn't possibly
get Linghang Group's help.

46
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,400
I...

47
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,480
I'll go back to sleep.

48
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,960
How can I take wedding photos alone?

49
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,200
Besides,

50
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,880
there are so many reporters.

51
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,160
How do I get out?

52
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,720
What he did

53
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,760
made both our families a joke.

54
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,120
Mr. Zhou said

55
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,240
you can fuse him into the photos.

56
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,840
As for the interview,

57
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,120
you can say something about

58
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,760
your passionate love story.

59
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,640
Mr. Zhou knows you're an expert.

60
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,600
Tell him,

61
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,720
now that he's agreed to marry me,

62
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,920
we're a community of shared interests.

63
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,560
Xu Zhou,

64
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,120
you need to help him

65
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,320
instead of letting him

66
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,000
fool around like an idiot.

67
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,440
Just go back.

68
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,880
Be careful on your way.

69
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,120
I don't want to go.

70
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,080
Well, look,

71
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,360
President Pei

72
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,920
is acting cute here.

73
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,880
I should record this.

74
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,560
Do you need me to take you upstairs?

75
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,840
No need.

76
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,560
Liu Yu has urged you many times

77
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,480
to get back to work.

78
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,760
President Pei,

79
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,000
have you forgotten about work

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,920
since we got together?

81
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,560
Perhaps I need to question

82
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,360
the reliability of our bid.

83
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,320
Liu Yu can handle it.

84
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,880
The priority right now

85
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,320
is to accompany
our most important partner.

86
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,920
Well, your most important

87
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,760
partner

88
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,160
is really tired

89
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,600
and needs to get some rest.

90
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,320

Really?
