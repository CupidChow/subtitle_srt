00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,200
Pei Zheng,

4
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,880
how have you been?

5
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,800
Thanks for your concern, Brother.

6
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,320
Cheng Yu and her mom

7
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,080
caused someone's death.

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,520
Do you think she

9
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,080
can still be with

10
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,960
that person's son
without feeling guilty?

11
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,360
You are quite concerned about

12
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,880
our relationship.

13
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,960
You approached her on purpose

14
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,880
to win her favor

15
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,440
and provoke me.

16
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,320
But listen,

17
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,200
this is far from enough.

18
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,240
No matter what tricks you play,

19
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:26,480
Cheng Yu

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,400
can only be mine.

21
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,640
Do you know she is allergic to lilies?

22
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,920
Just a whiff of the scent

23
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,760
will cause a full-body rash?

24
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,280
Do you know she only drinks

25
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,880
strong Americanos?

26
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,560
Do you know
how many orders I've introduced

27
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,520
to support Hongye Group?

28
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,880
Do you know she celebrates my birthday

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,240
every year?

30
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,240
Warm and romantic

31
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,360
birthday,

32
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,640
only the two of us.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Thanks for the explanation.

34
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,280
However,

35
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,200
it doesn't change the fact
that she doesn't love you.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,840
What did you say?

37
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,040
She

38
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,200
doesn't love you.

39
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,800
If she didn't love me,

40
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,280
why would she sleep with me

41
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,040
and be my canary?

42
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,960
I've kept her for three years.

43
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,440
That is something you can

44
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,760
never come close to.

45
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,600
Rest assured.

46
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,360
She won't have any feelings
for an abuser.

47
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,440
Whatever you want,

48
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,120
your relationship with her is over.

49
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:26,950
Don't worry,

50
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,160
from now on,

51
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,030
she'll live well

52
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,410
with me.

53
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,280
You are quite confident.

54
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,320
But I need to remind you

55
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,040
that the car accident

56
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,800
won't affect our relationship.

57
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,920
What do you mean?

58
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,120
You're the one who has been

59
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,440
turning us against each other.

60
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,800
However, as long as I love Cheng Yu,

61
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,880
there is nothing that can

62
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,800
stop us.

63
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,000
Rather than confronting me,

64
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,840
you should focus on

65
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,120
the cooperation between
Wanchuan Group and Lucheng.

66
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,000
I've never cooperated with your company.

67
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,000
Do you want me

68
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,360
to join Lucheng's project with you?

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,200
What can I get?

70
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,200
All the supermarkets in Lucheng

71
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,440
will be operated
by your company's subsidiaries.

72
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,880
At the same time,

73
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,600
I will also involve
the Lin Family in this project,

74
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,200
allowing the three of us
to achieve deep cooperation.

75
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,380
By then,

76
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,360
our best locations

77
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,160
will be at your disposal.

78
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,480
We haven't started to cooperate,

79
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,840
but you have a detailed understanding

80
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,560
of our group's needs.

81
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,120
So, is that a yes?

82
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,520
Chen Wenyou is definitely

83
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,320
interested in my proposal.

84
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,320
It seems

85
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,760
someone else is also
interested in this project.

86
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,760
Send someone to investigate

87
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,880
Pei Zheng and Bang Yun Group.

88
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,560
Yes.

89
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,080
It's easy for me to help you get

90
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,400
Lucheng's project.

91
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,760
But how are you going to
return the favor?

92
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,800
I remember

93
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
you love red wine.

94
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,520
I'll give my French winery

95
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,400
to you.

96
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,800
To me?

97
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,520
Then please help me get

98
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,040
Lucheng's project.

99
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,040
However,

100
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,270
if I refuse to cooperate

101
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,480
with your brother

102
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,040
and let him find out you're involved,

103
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,360
will it affect

104
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,400
your relationship?

105
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,840
Don't worry,

106
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
I will handle it.

107
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,960
Have you received the funds?

108
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,600
Confirm all the contracts and documents
upon receiving them.

109
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,680
Besides, keep an eye on the designers.

110
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,920
Make sure we have

111
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,920
ten different designs

112
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,320
before the launch.

113
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,600
- Well...
- Yu,

114
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,040
just leave everything to us.

115
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,400
You can rest assured.

116
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,640
But there's a more pressing issue now.

117
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,240
Enlighten me.

118
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,660
Why haven't you
been in touch with Mr. Pei?

119
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,520
Had a fight?

120
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,400
Talk less, work more.

121
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,840
Yes,

122
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,240
women should focus on their careers

123
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,400
and put men aside.

124
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,680
But I think

125
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,000
Mr. Pei

126
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,960
is different from other men.

127
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,480
He can not only restrain Zhou Jin

128
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,600
but guide Hongye Group.

129
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,080
He is kind and gentle to you

130
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,440
but aggressive towards the enemy.

131
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,520
And he always loves someone selflessly.

132
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,920
Only for you.

133
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,120
Look,

134
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,120
why can we

135
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,200
get all the benefits?

136
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,040
What benefits?

137
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,480
I'd thank god if you could work harder.

138
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,920
Stop gossiping.

139
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,880
Are you scolding me?
What's wrong with you?

140
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,800
Yu, don't be

141
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,680
so upset.

142
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,040
I found an amazing place.

143
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,520
I'll take you there.

144
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,400
Wow.

145
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,440
Come on, hurry up.

Here we are.

00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,120
Here's the coolest billiard table.

150
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,680
It's Bang Yun Group's property.

151
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,840
Let's go.

152
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,760
I have something to do.

153
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,240

174
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,200
we decided to help you.

175
