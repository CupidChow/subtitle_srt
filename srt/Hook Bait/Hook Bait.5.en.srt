00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,880
Pei Zheng, you said

4
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,500
I could ask for your help.

5
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,160
I'm waiting at Shengyuan Garden.

6
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,590
Thank you.

7
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,230
You want to know

8
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,630
why I've been tolerating

9
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,910
his maltreatment, right?

10
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:49,950
Because...

11
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,120
Hongye Group

12
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,550
represents my nostalgia for my mom.

13
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,870
In my hardest days,

14
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,600
Zhou Jin used Wanchuan Group

15
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:04,450
to help me.

16
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,520
The consequence was that

17
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,800
he controlled
both Hongye Group and me.

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,960
However,

19
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,520
Hongye Group survived.

20
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,110
Perhaps it's because of that gratitude,

21
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,900
I've been tolerating

22
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,300
his behaviors.

23
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,460
Like father, like son.

24
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,660
Back then, Zhou Song
also took over Shenghua Group

25
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,500
after my mom died.

26
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,180
They are the same.

27
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,660
I must

28
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,020
leave him.

29
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,900
You tried every means

30
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,620
to approach me only to get

31
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,460
Shenghua Group back, didn't you?

32
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,740
You couldn't make
any headway with Zhou Jin,

33
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,900
so you targeted me,

34
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,300
a canary that has been kept

35
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,860
by Zhou Jin.

36
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,300
That's right.

37
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,220
You've seen right through me.

38
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,980
Well,

39
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,980
are you the only one

40
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,700
who can investigate others?

41
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,820
Oh, by the way,

42
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,860
as for our company's streamer

43
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,940
Chen Xu,

44
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,300
it took me a long time to find out

45
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,340
that she's your distant cousin,

46
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,940
and it seems you're pretty close.

47
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,540
You sent her here as an eye, right?

48
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,100
But she's a really nice person

49
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,500
with strong ability.

50
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,500
Rest assured.

51
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,180
I won't make it personal.

52
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,340
You're so smart.

53
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,540
I'm starting to doubt

54
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,180
if you were pretending to be

55
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,060
a fragile canary just now.

56
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,300
I want to escape.

57
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,580
It's true.

58
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,020
If you can help me,

59
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,820
I believe

60
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,580
we'll be great partners.

What's wrong? I'm here.

81
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,940
I made breakfast. Come and eat.

82
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,980
Have breakfast.

83
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,620
I know you like eggs.

84
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:45,980

By the way, Xu Zhou
just called and asked

87
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,700
if you were awake.

88
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,660
He'll pick you up for a business trip.

89
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,100
What else did they say?

00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,140
Nothing else.

91
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,220
Got it.

92
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,190
From now on, don't answer

93
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,030
his calls.

94
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,700
Oh.

95
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,390
I want

96
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,020
to move out.

97
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,140
Why do you want to move out?

98
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,370
I don't want

99
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,140
to hear any more rumors.

100
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,620
No.

101
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,860
This is non-negotiable.

102
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,220
Cheng Yu, don't worry.

103
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,660
From now on, I'll

104
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,380
definitely control my temper.

105
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,260
As long as you behave,

106
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,380
I won't hurt you again.

107
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,510
Zhou Jin,

108
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,740
I know it's hard for you to accept

109
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,780
my request.

110
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,740
But after listening to

111
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,460
your heartfelt words last night,

112
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,300
I realized

113
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,260
you've always been good to me.

114
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,380
Perhaps you could try
giving me a little space,

115
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,220
and I won't try
to provoke you on purpose.

116
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,340
Provoke me on purpose?

117
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,340
You mean...

118
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,180
Zhou Jin,

119
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,340
I think

120
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,380
if we can

121
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,100
both calm down a little bit,

122
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,300
we'll get along quite well, right?

123
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,940
Of course, if you don't like

124
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,140
the way I am now,

125
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,060
I can continue to be disobedient.

126
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,260
I agree.

127
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,100
Then it's a deal.

128
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,180
Don't back out.

129
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,420
Okay.

130
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,980
I heard you were going out,

131
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,260
so I came here to see you.

132
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,180
How many times have I told you to knock?

133
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,820
I've also told you many times

134
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,810
given our relationship,

135
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,660
it's not necessary.

136
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,060
Lin Shu,

137
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,700
don't think that we're close

138
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,380
just because we're engaged.

139
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,820
Without my favor,

140
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,200
how could Zhou Song get you

141
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,660
such a good marriage?

142
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,100
How could you take over Shenghua Group?

143
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,050
Jin,

144
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,180
if you try to get to know me,

145
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,620
you will find out

146
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,950
we'll definitely become

147
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,420
a perfect match.

148
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,740
Don't you agree?

149
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,020
Shu, have some tea.

150
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,860
Thank you.

151
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:46,900
Mr. Zhou,

152
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,540
you know my father loves me very much,

153
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,900
but now Jin refuses to see me.

154
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,340
I'm afraid our cooperation...

155
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,500
Shu,

156
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,180
I don't think

157
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,620
you should worry.

158
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,020
I'll teach Jin

159
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,700
a lesson.

160
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,740
Rest assured.

161
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,820
I'll never

162
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,380
let anyone bully you.

163
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,340
Don't worry, Shu.
