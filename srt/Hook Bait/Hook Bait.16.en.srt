(I'm sorry.)

5
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,680
(I couldn't protect you.)

6
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,190
(I won't let you get hurt again.)

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Do you want me

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,310
to die of anger?

9
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,440
Die of anger?

10
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,510
After all these years,
you're still alive.

11
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,310
This idiot!

12
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,150
Mr. Zhou.

13
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,920
Shu.

14
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,310
You don't need to

15
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,120
keep Zhou Jin's secret anymore.

16
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,190
Now that he doesn't want to
fulfill his obligations,

17
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,150
it is unnecessary

18
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,830
for us to get married.

19
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,120
After all, he's like

20
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,190
a time bomb now.

21
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,360
Shu,

22
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,680
Jin was just confused.

23
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,590
Please don't be so impulsive.

24
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,470
What's the rush?

25
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,120
We've arranged
a marriage alliance for the heirs.

26
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,240
Zhou Jin is not your only son.

27
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,060
(Equity Transfer Agreement)

28
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm not Zhou Jin,

29
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,960
so I won't be your pawn.

30
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,200
Zheng,

31
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,960
you've changed your surname,

32
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,720
but you're still my blood.

33
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,790
You and your brother fought

34
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,960
for a woman.

35
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,470
I don't want to interfere with this.

36
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,440
Jin indeed has some mental issues.

37
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,750
He refuses to marry Ms. Lin.

38
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,470
If he does so,

39
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,550
Wanchuan Group will be in trouble.

40
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,800
At this critical point,

41
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,830
I need a capable assistant.

42
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,190
Come back and help me.

43
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,510
I know

44
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,960
Bang Yun Group is rising.

45
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,590
But what if

46
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,750
I hand over Shenghua Group to you?

47
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:18,300
(Asset Transfer Agreement)

48
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,700
(Board Resolution)

49
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,110
You have three days

50
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,830
to think about it.

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,720
We've got the results
of the Investigation.

52
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,880
They've confirmed that Wanchuan Group
used Hongye Group

53
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,960
for illegal activities.

54
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,080
We should hold our position.

55
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,750
I must

56
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,800
prove that Hongye Group was unaware

57
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,000
to secure their safety.

58
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
All the evidence
is inside Wanchuan Group.

59
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,270
Are you going back to the group?

60
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,320
Zhou Song already offered a position,

61
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,000
but I'm still considering it.

62
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,800
By the way, we found something else.

63
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,390
Three years ago,

64
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,440
Zhou Jin colluded with Changlong Group

65
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,800
to set Cheng Yu's father up,

66
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,390
which led to Hongye Group's bankruptcy.

67
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,830
However, it did no good
to Wanchuan Group.

68
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,800
If there was any benefit,

69
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,240
it would be that Zhou Jin got Cheng Yu

70
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,040
and kept her for three years.

71
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,000
Don't tell her

72
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,270
at this point.

73
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,880
Okay.

74
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,760
Take care of her.

75
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,440
You're awake.

76
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,000
What did you say?

77
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,920
You heard everything?

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,760
It was Zhou Jin who set my father up,

79
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,720
which led to our company's bankruptcy.

80
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,320
I need to talk to him.

81
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,200
Calm down.

82
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,270
How can I calm down?

83
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,440
Three years!

84
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,880
I've been enduring his maltreatment

85
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,440
only to repay his kindness!

86
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,950
Now I realize it was all fake!

87
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,390
You finally came to see me.

88
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,550
Are you surprised?

89
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,610
I can still talk to you

90
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,830
calmly like this.

91
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,390
I'm sorry, Cheng Yu.
I was too impulsive.

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,860
But...

93
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,270
But it was all because I love you.

94
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,390
Love?

95
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,600
You love me,

96
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,440
so you ruined my company

97
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,110
and made me your canary

98
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,480
that is scorned by others, right?

99
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,200
You love me,

100
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,040
so you grasped me tightly

101
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,230
and tried to drown me
in the bathtub, right?

102
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,480
It's not like that, Cheng Yu.

103
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,790
I really want to be with you!

104
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,000
I can give you anything,

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,950
as long as you behave...

106
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,390
Zhou Jin.

107
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,000
I always thought

108
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,760
you helped me when Hongye Group

109
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,200
was in trouble,

110
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,640
so I've been

111
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,670
tolerating you

112
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,000
no matter what you did.

113
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,320
However, now I've realized

114
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,720
it was all your plan.

115
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,550
Cheng Yu,

116
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,600
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,830
I'm so sorry!

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,840
I'm sorry!

119
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,160
Could you forgive me?

120
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,790
Is Pei Zheng

121
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,720
your type?

122
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,790
I...

123
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,950
I can also be like him.

124
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,440
I can learn.

125
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,640
Please don't leave me.

126
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,350
I can learn.

127
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,950
I love Pei Zheng

128
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,110
because he respects me,

129
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,480
understands me,

130
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,000
and won't force me

131
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,670
to do things against my will

132
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,270
or to accept

133
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,440
his feelings.

134
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,790
He would never

135
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,550
use violent means to control me.

136
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,880
Every bruise on my body

137
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,440
was caused by you.

138
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,440
Sorry, Cheng Yu!

139
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,920
I'm sorry!

140
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,830
I can change!

141
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,720
Trust me.

142
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,950
I can change!

143
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,790
Zhou Jin,

144
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,070
you're so pathetic.

145
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,440
From now on,

146
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,440
we'll be enemies.

147
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,000
Do you think he really loves you?

148
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,830
Zhou Song has talked to him.

149
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,160
He sabotaged our relationship

150
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,320
and beat me

151
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,270
only to

152
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,790
get Wanchuan Group back.

153
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,200
You think it's true love.

154
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,000
But it's a joke.

155
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,200
I won't believe

156
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,880
a single word you say.

157
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:50,950
Cheng Yu!
