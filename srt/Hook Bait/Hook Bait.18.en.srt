3
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,540
Brother.

4
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,980
Now I'm the heir of Wanchuan Group.

5
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,660
Stop messing around.

6
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,540
The so-called heir

7
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,420
is just a pawn of Zhou Song.

8
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,180
Why are you so proud?

9
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,020
This is just a kind reminder.

10
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,660
Otherwise, do you think
Dad will have mercy?

11
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,660
If you want to fight,

12
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,500
just go home.

13
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,020
I don't want to see you anymore.

14
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,100
Cheng Yu.

15
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,700
Mr. Zhou, something happened.

16
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,100
Your father sold Hongye Group.

17
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,620
Let's go.

18
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,820
Get lost.

19
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,140
You sold Hongye Group?

20
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,100
You're always well-informed.

21
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,180
Didn't Xu Zhou tell you?

22
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,380
Why are you asking me?

23
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,820
It doesn't matter.

24
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,860
Even if you sell Hongye Group,

25
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,420
I'll find another way

26
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,060
to trap Cheng Yu.

27
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,020
You've grown up.

28
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,540
Now you don't even respect your father.

29
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,180
Have you ever treated me like your son?

30
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,340
My mother committed suicide

31
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,420
because of you.

32
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,060
I got scars all over my body

33
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,620
because of you!

34
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,780
When I finally found

35
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,860
a woman I like,

36
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,620
you forced me
to get engaged with Lin Shu

37
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,340
to win their favor.

38
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,820
You found you couldn't control me,

39
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,490
so you asked your eldest son
to come back

40
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,900
and marry Lin Shu.

41
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,900
All of us

42
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,820
are nothing but pawns

43
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,980
in your plan.

44
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,580
Everything you do

45
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,220
is for yourself!

46
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,460
I'm doing all this

47
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,260
for my two sons!

48
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,100
Idiot!

49
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,820
Do you think I wouldn't fight back?

50
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,820
Zhou Song,

51
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,420
you really underestimated me!

52
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,460
Jin.

53
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,940
How can you talk to Dad like that?

54
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,220
Who are you to scold me?

55
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,900
Didn't you say
you wanted to be independent?

56
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,140
Well,

57
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,980
now you're his lickspittle?

58
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,460
I had the chance to come back

59
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,740
all because you were so useless.

60
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,620
Dad.

61
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,220
Lin Shu said you went on a date.

62
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,060
Yes.

63
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,140
It seems

64
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,540
you've thought through everything.

65
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,540
I will marry her.

66
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,300
I'll do anything

67
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,380
for the sake of our company.

68
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,540
It means you've grown up.

69
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,220
Zheng, you're a good son.

70
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,100
From now on, I'll discuss

71
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,100
everything with you.

72
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,540
I won't make decisions on my own.

73
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,860
Thank you, Dad.

74
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,600
I believe

75
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,060
Wanchuan Group

76
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,540
will get better.

77
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,940
Cheng Yu,

78
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,820
I've sculpted you

79
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,900
to be so perfect step by step.

80
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,580
You can only be mine.

81
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,620
Hello, Yu.

82
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,540
Something happened.

83
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,580
Check the hot topic.

84
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,180
Hot topic?

85
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,970
Inform the tech department.

86
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,410
Take down all the videos

87
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:29,570
and photos.

88
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,060
They'll get bonuses.

89
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,820
You've broken up with her. Why...

90
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,780
Stop wasting time here.

91
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,700
You should deal with it.

92
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,780
I'm worried about you.

93
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,460
You left Bang Yun Group

94
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,180
and gave up your shares to go back.

95
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,380
Zhou Song still

96
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,660
doesn't completely trust you.

97
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,940
Don't ruin everything

98
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,500
because of Cheng Yu.

99
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,580
We broke up,

100
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,540
and it was my fault.

101
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,300
I just want to make amends.

102
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,340
On the surface, we've

103
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,940
stopped funding Hongye Group.

104
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,100
If they can't get through this,

105
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,060
GreenForest Group will stop
supporting them too.

106
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,140
I've contacted Wu Jing,

107
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,380
Wanchuan's General Manager.

108
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,340
If we can get something from him,

109
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,580
Zhou Song will be over.

110
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,660
Deal with Zhou Song first.

111
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,700
I'll handle Cheng Yu's matter.

112
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,220
Thank you.

113
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,700
Look.

114
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,980
These netizens are crazy.

115
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,660
I'll use another account
to argue with them!

116
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,900
You're typing quite fast.

117
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,020
What's the situation now?

118
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,700
Yu,

119
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,580
someone deleted

120
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,780
a lot of videos and photos,

121
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,700
but the posts are spreading too fast.

122
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,380
There are so many bad comments

123
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,140
on our channel
that our streamer is crying.

124
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,700
GreenForest Group asked about this.

125
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,460
They said public opinion
could affect the stock price.

126
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,020
This is ridiculous!

127
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,420
They asked us to solve it.

128
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,700
What should we do now?

129
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,700
Bang Yun Group has stopped

130
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,940
funding us.

131
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,820
If GreenForest Group does the same...

132
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,020
Don't judge someone

133
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,980
without knowing the facts.

134
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,740
They have all been misled.

135
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,420
They are biased
without knowing anything.

136
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,380
Yes.

137
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,060
Actually, they don't even know

138
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,260
what happened.

139
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,820
They were just misled.

140
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,180
If we can reveal the truth

141
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,620
and change public opinion...

142
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,140
Reveal?

143
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,620
What should we do?

144
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,300
Canary's Counterattack.

145
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,300
What do you think of this title?

146
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,180
It seems pretty good.

147
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,740
Then hurry up and work.

148
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,580
Move.

149
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,340
Watch out for

150
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,860
our counterattack!

151
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,620
The statements Cheng Yu posted online

152
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,940
have seriously affected

153
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,940
our stock price.

154
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,740
No matter what, you have to give us

155
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,180
an explanation.

156
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,820
This is not a dead-end.

157
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,660
I think we can use this opportunity

158
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,900
to test Zheng.

159
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,740
Do you mean

160
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,700
Pei Zheng is up to

161
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,900
something else?

162
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,220
Over the past decade,

163
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,580
I've tried to persuade him
so many times,

164
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,740
yet he wouldn't come back.

165
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,860
Why did he

166
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,020
come back

167
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,100
at this point?

168
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,380
Isn't this too coincidental?

169
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,060
Okay.

170
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,060
Release the PR article within an hour

171
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,460
to accuse Cheng Yu of

172
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,580
falsifying facts.

173
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,700
We'll sue her.

174
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,300
Only by putting Cheng Yu in danger

175
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,820
can we find out if Pei Zheng

176
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,140
is loyal to us.

177
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,700
Only in this way

178
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,140
can we restore the reputation
of Lin Group

179
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,020
and Wanchuan Group.

180
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,180
In this way, we can

181
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,460
kill two birds with one stone.

182
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,940
So shameless!

183
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,860
They even said they'd sue us!

184
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,540
I'll argue with them.

185
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,700
Yu, they also exposed

186
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,220
our company's initial performance.

187
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,300
They said Wanchuan Group
supported Hongye Group

188
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,380
all because of improper relations.

189
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,420
How ridiculous!

190
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,700
What improper relations?

191
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,260
Are all the incoming calls

192
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,220
from our partners?

193
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,580
They're a bunch of hypocrites

194
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,740
who rush to reap rewards

195
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,100
and quit when

196
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,220
there are risks.

197
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,900
Hypocrites! Hypocrites!

198
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,940
It's all about business.

199
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,500
It's understandable.

200
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,820
Tell everyone

201
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,540
we'll hold a press conference
in two hours.

202
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,700
We can get through this.

203
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,900
What should we announce?

204
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,700
The betting agreement from back then

205
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,940
and Wanchuan Group's

206
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,820
suppression of us over the years.

207
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,500
Yu, isn't this a bit inappropriate?

208
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,940
What if we offend them?

209
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,940
We're already enemies.

210
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,900
Besides,

211
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,420
I'm not afraid of them.

212
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,620
Wait a moment.

213
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,540
An anonymous user

214
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,860
posted this video.

215
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,220
You like taking photos,

216
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,340
so let's do it!

217
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,220
This is when Zhou Jin

218
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,980
tried to hurt me in the bathroom.

219
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,180
He filmed it himself.

220
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,540
He posted his own video

221
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,620
to ruin himself?

222
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,700
What is he doing?

223
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,420
Isn't this a trick?

224
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,620
Yu,

225
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,460
look at the comments below.

226
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,340
They've all changed.

227
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,180
This video proves

228
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,220
we're telling the truth.

229
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,100
In that case,

230
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,940
this is good for us, right?

231
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,260
No matter what,

232
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,660
at least Wanchuan Group

233
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,980
has completely lost credibility.

234
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,140
Well,

235
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,220
did we win?

236
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,180
Absolutely.

237
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,300
Just like that?

238
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,860
The internet is so powerful, right?

239
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,620
We should've

240
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,660
sold the scream chickens

241
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,140
online.

242
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,140
Didn't I tell you?

243
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,140
You have a point.

244
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,380
Then make some slides.

245
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,940
Yu,

246
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,740
you can't make it personal.

247
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,740
Chen Xu, you'll do it.

248
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,900
It's your job.

249
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,980
- Your job.
- You proposed it first.

250
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,860
It's your job.

251
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,230
You'll do it.

252
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,310
(Pei Zheng)

253
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,350
Anyway, I won't do it.
