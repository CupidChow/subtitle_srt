3
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,000
You know nothing about love!

4
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,270
I admit when you saved

5
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,280
Hongye Group,

6
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,280
I was a little grateful to you.

7
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,600
But that bit of gratitude

8
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,750
was gradually destroyed

9
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,740
by your distorted love

10
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,280
and perverted control.

11
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:01,840
Distorted love...

12
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,040
Perverted control...

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,120
What should I do?

14
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,960
Why has no one ever told me?

15
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,160
Cheng Yu,

16
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,040
I only want to be with you!

17
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,160
Am I wrong?

18
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,160
Zhou Jin!

19
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,120
Whether it's your pain or her pain,

20
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,040
let's put an end to it!

21
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,990
Cheng Yu, I...

22
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,240
Zhou Jin, listen carefully,

23
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,680
don't ever

24
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,280
bother us again.

Cheng Yu,

28
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,680
I have one last question.

29
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,280
If I had respected you
like Pei Zheng did,

30
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,160
would we have

31
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,360
been together?

32
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,280
There's no point of

33
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,840
saying this now.

34
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,720
Zhou Jin,

35
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,120
from the day you controlled Cheng Yu,

36
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,270
you were destined to lose her.

(One Month Later)

41
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,680
Zhou Song, the Chairman
of Wanchuan Group,

42
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,200
(Chairman Zhou Detained)
was convicted of

43
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,040
money laundering,
tax evasion, and murder.

44
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,380
Zhou Jin, the executive director
of Wanchuan Group,

45
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,260
was convicted of
intentional harm and other crimes

46
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,400
for unlawful intrusion and kidnapping.

47
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,980
Wu Jing, the project manager,

48
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,720
was convicted of
aiding in money laundering.

49
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,560
They've all been arrested.

50
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,720
They will be punished by the law.

51
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,520
It's finally over.

52
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,160
Let's have a drink

53
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,600
for a perfect ending.

54
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:58,930
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

55
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,880
As the saying goes,

56
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,620
"What goes around comes around."

57
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,860
One should never break the law,

58
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,700
right?

59
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,460
However, Ms. Lin

60
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,860
is quite interesting.

61
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,460
The evidence she provided

62
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,660
really worked.

63
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,700
Fortunately, everything went smoothly.

64
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,580
The exhibition in Singapore
has also ended.

65
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,260
Yu, what's your plan next?

66
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,700
As for my plan...

67
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,660
Actually, when I was in Singapore,

68
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,460
I had a deal with some

69
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,540
overseas distributors.

70
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,420
We will establish a Domestic

71
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,060
Snack Alliance overseas.

72
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,060
Not only the well-known brands

73
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,780
but also some emerging products

74
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,580
will have the opportunity
to be promoted.

75
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,220
In that case,

76
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,480
our snacks

77
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,100
will soon dominate the world.

78
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,410
That's too much.

79
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,940
Pei,

80
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,790
you need to try harder.

81
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,380
It seems Ms. Cheng

82
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,500
only cares about work

83
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,180
and doesn't want to marry you.

84
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,420
Yu is

85
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,420
a career woman, okay?

86
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,310
Men don't matter.

87
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,540
I don't like how you put it.

88
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:04,980
Maybe some of us

89
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,940
are spoiled rich kids.

90
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,100
However,

91
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,500
there are still some good guys.

92
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,420
Who?

93
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,060
Such as Mr. Liu,

94
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,940
right?

95
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,620
Mr. Liu is so outstanding.

96
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,060
What's that look?

97
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,100
Don't you agree with me?

98
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:20,980
Listen,

99
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,020
Yu will go abroad for a year,

100
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:23,980
and I

101
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,660
will be in charge of Hongye Group.

102
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,500
By then,

103
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,060
watch your language.

104
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,180
I hold grudges.

105
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,540
Mr. Liu, he's so annoying. Beat him up.

106
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,420
- Exactly.
- Beat him up.

107
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,020
Mr. Liu, you...

108
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,860
Are you sure?

109
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,980
Yes.

110
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,930
Of course.

111
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,020
I said I'd make Hongye Group thrive.

112
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,700
I won't miss any opportunity.

113
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,140
Okay.

114
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,180
I support you.

115
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,460
You

116
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,780
just need to do

117
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,540
whatever you like.

118
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,420
I'm still here.

119
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,060
Of course I'm not worried.

120
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,020
Given that you love me so much,

121
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,700
you'll often visit me, won't you?

122
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,780
However, I won't pay for

123
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,100
your flight tickets.

124
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,980
It's okay.

125
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,140
You can repay me with other things.

126
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,740
What things?

127
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,100
Tell us more.

128
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,020
Focus on

129
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,620
your career planning, okay?

130
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,980
You're holding hands.

131
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,180
It's the right time.

132
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,420
Kiss each other.

133
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,980
Kiss!

134
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,580
Hey, are you...

135
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,740
Kiss!

136
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,860
Is that enough?

137
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,700
Okay, cheers.

138
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,460
For a better tomorrow of Hongye Group.

139
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,160
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

140
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,260
Thank you for your hard work.

141
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,780
When I come back, I'll give you bonuses.

142
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,900
Okay, that's it.

143
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,740
Bye.

144
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,620
Still working?

145
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,900
Hey, you scared me.

146
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,820
Come on, I cooked for you.

147
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,740
What did you cook?

148
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,220
Don't hold me. I'm not a child.

149
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,540
So what?

150
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,940
I like taking care of you.

151
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,700
Why did you make so much?

152
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,300
Look, Three Delicacies Noodles,

153
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,900
Red Date and Fungus Soup,

154
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,540
and the fruit platter you asked for.

155
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,420
So good.

156
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,220
You can cook new dishes every day.

157
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,140
Being a president

158
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,860
is such a waste of your talent.

159
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,740
You should become a chef.

160
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,780
No way.

161
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,020
I only cook for you.

162
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,860
No.

163
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,220
I can't afford such an expensive chef.

164
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,580
I'm rich.

165
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,860
You can pay in another way.

166
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,820
You're always talking nonsense.

167
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,940
I want dragon fruit.

168
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,220
Well, is it good?

169
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,100
It's so sweet.

170
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,540
I have another gift for you.

171
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,420
What gift?

172
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,140
What is this?

173
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,140
Open it.

174
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,230
This...

175
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,420
Did you check my shopping secretly?

176
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,340
Isn't this the bag I've always wanted?

177
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,670
It's my duty to clear

178
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,940
my girlfriend's shopping cart.

179
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,100
There's another one.

180
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,500
Another one?

181
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,660
What is this?

182
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,580
Sunglasses?

183
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,900
Do you like it?

184
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,620
Are you giving me a car?

185
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,500
Yes.

186
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,900
Shall we try it?

187
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,440
Okay.

188
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,900
Finish the meal first.

189
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,140
Here.

190
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,820
The soup.

191
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,500
There are little flowers.

192
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,460
Do you like it?
