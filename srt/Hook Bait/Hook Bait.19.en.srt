3
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,000
Chairman, why are you here?

4
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,160
Did you post these things online

5
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,320
to ruin Wanchuan Group and yourself?

6
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,920
Dad,

7
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,840
don't be angry,

8
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,320
or you might have a heart attack,

9
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,760
and Wanchuan Group

10
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,520
will really fall into my hands.

11
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,720
Good.

12
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,160
You're not my son anymore.

13
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,400
However, from now on,

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,480
you won't get any

15
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,120
inheritance from me.

16
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,560
Yu, everyone is supporting you

17
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,200
(Zhao Yong)
in defending your rights.

18
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,680
Our live streaming has so many people.

19
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,560
We had a great win.

20
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,640
What are you doing here?

21
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,240
Am I not welcomed?

22
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,560
Just a kind reminder,

23
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,640
you're no longer the CEO
of Bang Yun Group,

24
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,680
and we're not partners anymore.

25
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,880
So,

26
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,000
you have no reason to be here.

27
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,960
But I'm your ex-boyfriend.

28
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,600
You do realize you're my ex, right?

29
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,620
Your fiancee is

30
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,940
Lin Shu now.

31
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,380
Then let's talk about love.

32
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,420
Sorry.

33
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,340
We've broken up.

34
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,580
There's no love between us.

35
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,700
Alright.

36
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,660
I should've asked Liu Yu
to leave my name on the web pages

37
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,620
when he took down all the videos.

38
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,180
Some foolish girls still don't know

39
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,940
who they should thank.

40
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,900
Why are you laughing?

41
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,820
You knew it?

42
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,820
Of course.

43
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,060
Who do you think I am?

44
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,460
If you do good things

45
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,660
without leaving a name again,

46
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,940
I will give all the credit

47
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,900
to Mr. Liu.

48
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,700
I'm just worried about you.

49
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,540
If you really care,

50
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,220
don't do such things.

51
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,940
What if Zhou Song finds out?

52
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,820
If he finds out,

53
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,660
our efforts will be in vain,

54
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,140
and you'll be in danger.

55
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,940
Trust me. Give me some time.

56
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,460
I will definitely discover the truth.

57
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,900
How much time should I give you?

58
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,900
I've endured for three years.

59
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,660
Isn't that enough?

60
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,940
Do I have to suffer?

61
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,660
You don't.

Zhou Song talked to me.

He wants me

66
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,020
to inherit Wanchuan Group.

00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,460

68
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,420
a good opportunity to investigate
the company.

00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,700
Could this be a trap?

00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,340
Why would that cunning man

71
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,820
suddenly tell you this?

We do have a connection.

89
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,060
Cheng Yu, look,

90
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,620
I'm still the one
who loves you the most.

91
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,860
You got into trouble,

92
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,740
yet Pei Zheng hid in Wanchuan Group

93
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,420
and didn't help you at all.

94
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,620
But I...

95
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,460
Now everyone is scolding me.

96
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,860
But I'm so happy

97
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,660
because only I can protect you.

98
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,060
Is that all?

99
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,180
I did all this

100
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,900
to prove I love you.

101
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,460
I was afraid you'd leave me,

102
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,900
so I hurt you again and again.

103
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,180
Give me another chance.

104
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,500
Let's get back together,

105
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,500
okay?

106
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,820
Look,

107
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,620
Pei Zheng and Lin Shu
are already engaged.

108
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,900
Even fate is letting them

109
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:00,900
make way for us.

110
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,660
Cheng Yu,

111
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,860
we're meant to be together.

112
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,860
Are you out of your mind?

113
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,660
First, you posted
photos and videos online,

114
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,380
then you pretended
to help me clear my name.

115
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,380
Do you think your dirty trick
would make me willing to

116
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,060
continue being your canary?

117
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,060
Sorry, I'm not a fool.

118
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,300
I will never forgive you.

119
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,460
Why?

120
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,860
Why do you refuse to look at me

121
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,060
no matter what I do?

122
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,860
You're waiting for Pei Zheng
to come back.

123
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,580
Our stock has plummeted lately,

124
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,540
and my parents are very angry.

125
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,940
We can't let him
go on acting recklessly.

126
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,220
Mr. Zhou, if you can't

127
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,740
control Zhou Jin,

128
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,540
I don't think the marriage

129
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,700
alliance will work.

130
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,980
The Zhou Family has a promising future,

131
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,820
but with the time bomb,

132
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,540
you could be ruined at any time.

133
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,140
Shu,

134
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,980
I understand all your concerns.

135
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,860
But rest assured,

136
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,700
I'll find a way to control him.

137
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,460
Fortunately, this incident

138
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,530
shows that Pei Zheng

139
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,540
is reliable.

140
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,200
As for Pei Zheng,

141
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,980
if we get rid of the time bomb
of Shenghua Group for good,

142
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,500
no matter what he does,

143
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,020
it won't explode.

144
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,740
How?

145
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,860
In this world,

146
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,180
only dead people can keep secrets.
