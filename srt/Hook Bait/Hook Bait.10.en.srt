Financial Report Analysis)

4
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,920
They really falsified accounts.

5
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,600
Pei,

6
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,600
what's your plan?

7
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,080
Set them up.

8
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,120
Let the old man notice

9
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,160
someone discovered this.

10
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,280
I know him well.

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,760
He'll sell Shenghua Group.

12
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,000
I've discussed this with the Pei Family.

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,960
We will acquire it.

14
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,040
That's too easy for Zhou Song.

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,440
We have evidence.

16
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,440
He can't get away.

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,680
Once Hongye Group is out,

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,160
we'll take action.

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,600
Do you have feelings for Cheng Yu?

20
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,280
Do you know who caused

21
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,120
Pei Zheng's mom's death?

22
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,720
When I was young,

23
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,680
I always felt that I lived

24
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,400
in the shadow of Pei Zheng.

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,080
He is the legitimate son,

26
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:30,920
but I'm

27
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,360
just a son of my dad's mistress.

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,000
When I met my dad outside,

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,480
I could only call him uncle.

30
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,520
I couldn't take the surname Zhou,

31
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,840
and no one thought
I'd take over Wanchuan Group.

32
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,920
However, do you know

33
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,560
when did

34
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,120
all this change?

35
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,920
It was when Pei Zheng's mom

36
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,480
passed away.

37
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,840
That was the most painful year
for Pei Zheng

38
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,920
and the happiest year for me.

39
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,720
Our lives switched places.

40
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:11,120
My dad married my mom,

41
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,440
and I finally took the surname.

42
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,040
They also treated me as

43
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,160
the successor of Wanchuan Group.

44
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,800
However, it's quite strange.

45
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,160
In the Zhou Family,

46
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,320
it seems only one of the two sons

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,840
can live well.

48
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,440
What exactly do you want to say?

49
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,560
His mom's death

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
was the biggest blow of his life.

51
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,720
And the cause of all this

52
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,080
was you.

53
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,000
No.

54
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,600
More precisely,

55
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,240
it's you and your mom.

56
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,560
Do you remember that car accident?

57
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,040
When you were eight years old,

58
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,640
you and your mom had a car accident.

59
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,920
At that time, a lady tried to save you,

60
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,720
and there was another accident...

61
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,040
- It was so quick.
- Mom!

62
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,820
(Pei Zheng)

63
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,520
However, if Pei Zheng finds out

64
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,080
he lost

65
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,720
a complete family because of you,

66
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,760
will he despise you as much as

67
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,800
he despises me

68
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,440
or even more?

69
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,820
(Pei Zheng)

70
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,000
Hello.

71
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,280
You're not at home.

72
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,760

73
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,640
I just got home.

74
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,680

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,520
Thank you.

76
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,960
Okay.

You're welcome.

78
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,520
Anyway,

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,640

80

83

to get close to Zhou Jin again.

84
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,320
I want to tell you
