3
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,630
Now that you've admitted

4
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:44,990
you're having an affair with Ms. Cheng,

5
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,150
this round of votes

6
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:47,990
is invalid!

7
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:48,950
Mr. Liu,

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,950
please disqualify

9
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,230
Hongye Group

10
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:52,870
and vote again.

11
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,320
First,

12
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:56,880
I like Cheng Yu,

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,790
and it's not a mistake.

14
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:58,640
Second,

15
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,960
before the bidding started,

16
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,830
I had given up voting.

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,030
This document can prove it.

18
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,520
You gave up?

19
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,080
Are you qualified?

20
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,800
Mr. Qiu, now that

21
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,440
you've mentioned it,

22
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,190
I can only announce

23
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:19,240
to everyone

24
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,440
I'm

25
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,350
the CEO of Bang Yun Group.

26
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,100
That's right,

27
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,080
he's the CEO and the largest shareholder

28
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,880
of Bang Yun Group.

29
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,520
So,

30
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,760
let's congratulate Hongye Group

31
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,990
on winning the bid of Bang Yun Game.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,110
- Great!
- Congratulations!

33
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,440
(Mr. Pei, you've been low-key.)

34
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,840
(Sorry for hiding it from you.)

35
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,710
You thought you could
force them to break up

36
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,160
by sending Qiu Shang to cause a scene?

37
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,910
They seem so in love.

38
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,960
Has she ever treated you like that?

39
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,080
Zhou Jin,

40
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,680
I feel sorry for you.

41
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,600
You controlled her for so many years,

42
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,990
yet she never yielded.

43
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,440
I didn't expect she'd turn to

44
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,320
your brother so quickly.

45
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,400
It's between me and her.

46
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,910
None of your business.

47
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,470
Come on, cheers.

48
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,800
- Cheers.
- Come on, Yu.

49
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,350
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

50
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,080
Yu,

51
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,750
don't just drink.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,270
Are you still mad at my brother?

53
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,470
My Brother didn't tell you

54
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,520
about his identity

55
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,910
because he was afraid
you'd give up the bidding

56
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,800
after knowing the truth.

57
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,240
Please forgive him.

58
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,710
I'm not angry with him.

59
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,400
I'm just

60
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,160
confused.

61
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,190
It's okay. I'll think about it.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,840
Yu,

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,630
you can't just give up like this.

64
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,750
If you're still upset,

65
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,680
Mr. Pei will get upset too,

66
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,470
and so will I.

67
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,660
(Pei Zheng)

68
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:23,680
Hello.

69
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,470
Mr. Pei.

70
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,310
What's wrong?

71
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,080
Alright,

72
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,110
then I'll give you a chance to explain.

73
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,000
See you tonight.

74
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,720
What are you looking at?

75
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,600
Eat food.

76
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,190
Would you like anything else?

77
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,000
Do you like it?

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,440
Isn't this Mr. Pei?

79
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,470
What's wrong?

80
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,080
Is there anything else
you want to tell me

81
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,080
in person?

82
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,270
Yes, there is.

83
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,620
I'm the owner of two villas in Shanghai,

84
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,000
an investor in domestic emerging enterprises,

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,110
and a large account holder
in four banks.

86
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,190
Okay, that's enough.

87
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,720
Stop showing off.

88
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,920
Then tell me,

89
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,480
why would you, a successful CEO,

90
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,440
approach me?

91
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,680
I don't deserve it.

92
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,430
I didn't tell you

93
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,400
because it involved too many things.

94
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,120
On the one hand,

95
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,320
I really want to

96
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,520
show off to you.

97
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,400
On the other hand,

98
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,400
during the bidding,

99
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,960
we should avoid suspicion.

100
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,470
Besides,

101
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,960
I wanted to prove

102
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,800
that Hongye Group's success
was because of you.

103
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,240
You are truly outstanding.

104
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,870
Of course.

105
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,350
This is the first step
for me and Hongye Group.

106
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,670
In the future,
we'll face more challenges

107
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,640
and grow rapidly.

108
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,470
I'll take complete control of my life.

109
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,840
Count me in.

110
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,560
