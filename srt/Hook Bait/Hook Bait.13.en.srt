Listen carefully.

4
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,910
We need to be fully prepared for

5
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,880
this afternoon's bidding meeting.

6
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,240
I will give a presentation

7
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,670
of the entire plan.

8
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,350
Zhao Yong, you'll check the samples
taken to the site.

9
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,230
Chen Xu, you'll check the materials
given to the judges.

10
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,350
No problem.

11
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,600
We need to

12
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,990
have a great win.

Play some Avengers music for me.

14
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:05,800
Guys,

15
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,200
today, we'll show Qiu Shang

16
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,000
that all dogs

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,440
have their days!

18
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,310
That's right!

19
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,300
If it weren't for the size and history
of the company,

20
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,310
Changlong Group
should've been phased out

21
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,620
for its outdated products.

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,440
Stop talking about others.

23
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,670
Focus on ourselves.

24
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,440
Keep it up.

25
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,520
- Keep it up.
- Keep it up.

26
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,000
Cheng Yu,

27
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,080
I didn't expect you'd get back together

28
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,840
after knowing the truth of the accident.

29
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,880
At the bidding meeting,

30
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,710
I will humiliate all of you.

31
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,630
Mr. Zhou, rest assured.

32
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,080
I've arranged everything.

37
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,760
We hope that in the upcoming
bidding process,

38
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,830
we can receive your support
and appreciation.

39
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,710
Thank you.

40
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,590
Their proposal is quite detailed.

41
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,760
It's difficult for Cheng Yu

42
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,080
to win the bid.

43
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,110
Hello, everyone.

44
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,710
I am Cheng Yu, the CEO of Hongye Group.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,080
I'll relinquish

46

It's up to you.

If she succeeds,

49
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,080
I'll invest in them
in the name of Bang Yun.

Okay.

Let's bet.

Today,

55
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,520
I want to show you

(Corn Crisps Marketing Plan)

58
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,830
Considering

59
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,520
it's a racing game,

60
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,390
we plan to put the snacks into the game

61
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,750
as a reserve of supplies,

62
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,670
which can locate
our customers accurately

63
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,240
through the Scratchcard gameplay.

64
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,520
Well,

65
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,190
from what I'm hearing,

66
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,030
are you asking Bang Yun Group

67
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,960
to promote your products?

68
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,440
Don't be ridiculous.

69
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,520
In addition, we hired

70
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,440
an award-winning designer

71
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,440
to create

72
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,400
a non-sticky mechanism

73
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,880
so that players can play games
and eat snacks

74
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,830
at the same time.

75
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,190
Next, I'm going to

76
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,270
present the details.

77
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,880
She's focusing on

78
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,750
their strong points.

79
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,710
That's called a highlight.

81

Your idea?

82
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,110
She's been hiding it from me.

83
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,360
How is that possible?

84
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,520
Finally,

85
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,270
here's a contract between
GreenForest Group and us.

86
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,440
If Hongye Group

87
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,800
can win the bid,

90
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,880
will sell our products.

91
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,520
In that case,
we'll organize offline events

92
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,960
to promote our products and the game.

93
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,880
I think it'll be very effective.

94
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,160
I'm impressed.

95
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,830
You even slept with Chen Wenyou.

96
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,960
So impressive.

97
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,430
You can only think of filthy things.

98
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,510
Qiu Shang,

99
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,520
you've ruined your company's reputation.

100
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,470
Next, let's start voting.

101
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,630
Thank you
for participating in this bidding.

I disagree!

107
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,870
I want to report!

108
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,750
I want to report!

109
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,510
I report

110
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,230
that the CEO of Hongye Group

111
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,150
tried every means to seduce

112
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,640
the president's assistant

113
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,750
of Bang Yun Group!

114
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,590
We firmly oppose

115
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,150
such malicious competition!

116
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,720
Mr. Qiu is right.

117
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,800
We strongly oppose such a nasty trick.

118
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,790
Exactly.

119
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,400
After all, Bang Yun Group
is a big company.

120
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,590
We can't let them disrupt the industry

121
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,960
and ruin our reputation.

122
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,350
In my opinion,

123
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,590
Hongye Group
should withdraw from the bidding.

124
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,950
Hongye Group should
withdraw from the bidding.

125
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,640
Yes, withdraw from the bidding!

126
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,480
- Withdraw!
- Withdraw from the bidding!

127
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,120
Withdraw from the bidding!

128
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,550
Withdraw from the bidding!

Qiu Shang.

130
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,000
You said I won the bid

131
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,120
because of Mr. Pei.

132
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,720
Do you have any evidence?

133
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,080
These photos are the solid proof.

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,390
With just a few photos,

135
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,120
you're making up stories.

136
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,520
Cheng Yu,

137
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,560
you're so shameless.

138
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,320
Back then, you were so obedient

139
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,200
to Mr. Zhou

140
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,840
to get funds for Hongye Group.

141
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,270
You won

142
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,840
both his body and heart.

143
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,880
He really couldn't

144
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,120
resist you, especially in bed.

145
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,110
Shut up! It's nonsense!

146
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,590
I'll beat the hell out of you!

147
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,320
Qiu Shang, who the hell are you?

148
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,750
Watch your mouth!

149
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,230
If your father knew this,

150
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,550
would he crawl out of his grave

151
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,470
and slap you?

152
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,150
I like Ms. Cheng.

153
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,240
Is there a problem?

154
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,630
Isn't this the male lead?

155
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,630
That's perfect.

156
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,480
Why don't you tell us

157
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,240
how you seduced a rich woman?

158
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,350
Maybe you can teach us

159
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,720
how to do it.

160
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,960
Ms. Cheng.

161
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,590
Ms. Cheng doesn't argue

162
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,080
because she's kind.

163
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,400
But Qiu Shang,

164
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,080
what you said is pure slander.

165
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,160
I believe everyone

166
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,870
knows how Zhou Jin managed to

167
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,670
control Hongye Group

168
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,240
through Wanchuan Group.

169
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,080
However, Ms. Cheng
refused to rely on him

170
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,430
and signed up for this.

171
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,120
She even abandoned Wanchuan Group,

172
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,720
so why would she be interested in me?

173
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,400
