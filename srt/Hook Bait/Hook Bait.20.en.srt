3
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,840
What's going on with Zhao?

4
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,760
I haven't seen him for days.

5
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,160
I can't believe it.

6
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,040
Who are you? What do you want?

7
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,040
Give me the documents.

8
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,120
I've called the police.

9
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,760
Mr. Pei?

10
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,740
What are you doing here?

11
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,260
As the General Manager
of Wanchuan Group,

12
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,660
you helped the group launder money
with Mr. Zhao.

13
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,220
Now people are hunting you.

14
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,420
Shouldn't you find a way out?

15
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,460
Nonsense!

16
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,540
I work for Mr. Zhou,

17
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,380
and he...

18
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:30,620
No way.

19
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,500
Impossible.

20
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,220
Mr. Zhou and I are on the same boat.

21
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,980
He wouldn't do this to me.

22
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,100
Then you'll be missing just like Zhao.

23
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:39,980
Zhao?

24
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,380
Wait!

25
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,340
I can cooperate with you,

26
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,180
but

27
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,660
the documents have a passcode,

28
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,860
and I only have half of it.

29
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:51,900
It's real!

30
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,380
Back then,

31
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,340
Zhao and I

32
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,580
took care of everything.

33
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,540
Zhou Song didn't get involved!

34
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,900
Later, I was worried

35
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,500
that Zhou Song

36
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,580
would betray me,

37
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,900
so I kept

38
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,060
all the evidence.

39
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,380
For our safety, Zhao and I

40
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,660
each set half of the password,

41
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,820
so I only have half of it.

42
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,060
How can I know
if you're telling the truth?

43
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,660
Decrypting the files will take
at least a few days.

44
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,140
What if they are fake?

45
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,260
How could I possibly

46
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,900
deceive you at this point?

47
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,670
If you promise

48
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,740
to protect my family,

49
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,220
I...

50
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,580
I'll do anything for you!

51
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,580
Anything!

52
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,500
I told you

53
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,100
all men are bad.

54
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,380
I used to think

55
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,420
Pei Zheng was a good guy.

56
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,260
It turns out he's just a playboy,

57
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,780
not to mention Zhou Jin.

58
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,460
He's a pervert

59
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,740
and control freak!

60
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,460
Now Ms. Cheng

61
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,380
has become a workaholic again.

62
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,420
She doesn't smile anymore.

63
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,820
I'm so afraid she'll become
depressed and isolated again.

64
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,940
It's just too unfair for Ms. Cheng.

65
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,180
She met the wrong people.

66
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,220
I didn't expect
my brother would do that.

67
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,660
Yu is a strong woman.

68
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,860
We all know that.

69
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,580
Isolated?

70
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,100
I don't think so.

71
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,540
She's not only our boss

72
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,020
but a good friend.

73
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,140
We need to find a way

74
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,540
to make her smile again.

75
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,500
Well, how about this?

76
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,260
Let's find some handsome guys

77
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,020
to help her move on, okay?

78
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,580
I want that too.

79
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,140
Stop kidding.

80
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,180
I'm serious.

81
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,100
What do you think?

82
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,860
I think it's a good idea.

83
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,540
By the way, prepare the stuff

84
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,820
for the exhibition,

85
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,260
at least ten pieces

86
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,180
of each flavor.

87
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,620
When we're in Singapore,

88
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,660
remember to find a way

89
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,420
to make appointments
with all the distributors.

90
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,540
Don't make mistakes.

91
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,380
Yu,

92
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,100
just leave the work to me.

93
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,420
You can rest assured.

94
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,320
In the next few days,

95
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,700
you can get some rest.

96
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,420
Don't shed tears for that scum.

97
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,560
It's not worth it.

98
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,700
Just adjust your mood.

99
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,700
In a couple of days, our products

100
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,340
will impress everyone at the conference.

101
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,180
Of course,

102
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,540
as a career woman,

103
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,500
how could I possibly
shed tears for love?

104
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,220
You can watch

105
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,740
some videos of handsome guys.

106
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,700
It's good for health.

107
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:13,770
Okay.

108
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,300
You send me many videos every day.

109
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,540
I'll watch them. Goodbye.

110
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,700
What videos?

111
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,660
Well,

112
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,140
are you interested?

113
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,620
Is it not enough to look at me?

114
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,860
Actually,

115
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,620
you can learn a bit more.

116
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,420
It's quite impressive.

117
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,260
Look.

118
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,820
Why don't you teach me?

119
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,700
I can't.

120
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,940
It's not what I should learn.

121
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,860
Then let me teach you.

122
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,380
You don't watch these things, right?

123
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,020
Where did you learn it?

124
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,050
So itchy.

125
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,140
Hey, enough.

126
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,860
I haven't finished my work.

127
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,980
I'll get back to work.

How should I know? Open the door.

140
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,580
Hurry up and hide.

141
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,460
Not here.

142
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,320
- Yu.
- She's coming in.

143
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,720
- Yu.
- I'm back.

144
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,340
It's so early.

145
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,420
Why are you together?

146
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,620
Come on, have a seat.

147
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,620
Zhao Yong and I were worried
you'd be upset,

148
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,900
so we had a brainstorm

149
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,860
to solve your major life issue.

150
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,740
- Guess what happened?
- What?

151
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,260
Yu, you probably don't know this.

152
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,380
You don't know.

153
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,660
Since you stood up
against Wanchuan Group,

154
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,140
many people have been

155
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,740
so obsessed with you.

156
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,940
Not just that.

157
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,700
They're crazy for you!

158
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,380
Many rich men visited

159
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,020
our live streaming channel.

160
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,980
They're rich.

161
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,940
They spent a lot of money

162
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,900
only to meet you.

163
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,900
Only to meet you.

164
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,220
I'm also surprised by

165
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,260
this situation,

166
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,300
but

167
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,820
we both agree

168
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,380
the best way to forget about
a relationship

169
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,220
is

170
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,260
to start a new one.

171
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,580
So today, we've selected

172
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,900
so many guys for you.

173
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,140
They're all outstanding.

174
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,140
We have all kinds of men.

175
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,020
All kinds of men.

176
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,500
Cute young boy.

177
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,900
Mature elite man.

178
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,460
And this one...

179
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,260
Brother!

180
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,740
Why are you here?
