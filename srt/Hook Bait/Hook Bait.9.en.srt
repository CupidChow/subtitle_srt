Okay.

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,040
Yu.

6
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,580
This...

7
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,400
Isn't this Mr. Pei?

8
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,240
You...

9
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,440
We...

10
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,000
What's wrong?

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,480
Files delivery.

12
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,440
Is that strange?

13
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,600
Brother, when did you

14
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,320
become a delivery guy?

15
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,720
Mind your own business.

16
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,000
It's none of your business.

17
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,440
Our company is about to have good news.

18
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,130
The good news is that

19
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,320
we'll get the project.

20
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,360
Take this.

21
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,960
Implement it strictly.

22
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,440
Yu,

23
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,360
are you making it personal?

24
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,400
- Why?
- Take it.

25
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,040
Alright,

26
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,560
I won't disturb your work.

27
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,000
By the way,

28
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,840
do you have time for dinner tonight?

29
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,300
Tonight...

30
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,240
Yes, she has time.

31
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,320
We'll make sure she leaves work early.

32
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,760
Yes. She definitely has time.

33
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,600
Bye.

34
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,980
Yu, listen,

35
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,780
thanks to Mr. Chen's help,

36
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,020
our R&D Department

37
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,180
is full of energy.

38
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,620
Do you know Wei Guan

39
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,020
even said good things about you

40
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,980
in front of colleagues?

41
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,820
I know.

42
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,620
I've tried the new flavors

43
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,620
you developed.

44
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,540
They're good.

45
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,740
The design has also improved.

46
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,340
I am quite confident

47
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,460
about this bidding.

48
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,220
As for Wei Guan,

49
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,740
he didn't take it personally.

50
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,260
He did very well this time.

51
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,180
If we win the bidding,

52
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,620
I'll also give him a bonus.

53
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,660
Yu, I think

54
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,140
you should put this aside.

55
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,980
You work every day.

56
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,700
There is always work to be done,

57
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,100
but you're facing
a once-in-a-lifetime event.

58
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:39,940
So,

59
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,540
you should seize the opportunity.

60
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,620
Once in a lifetime?

61
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,860
Life's major event!

62
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,820
I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

63
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,700
See you tonight.

64
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,060
Are you okay?

65
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,540
You need more work to do.

66
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,180
Is the food enough?

67
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,260
No need for more, right?

68
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,700
It's definitely enough.

69
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,240
It must be my brother.

70
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,860
Brother, you're here.

71
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,380
Welcome, Mr. Pei.

72
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,420
Today, you'll

73
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,980
have a good meal

74
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,780
and chat with Yu.

75
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,860
You made food for me.

76
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,700
That's quite an honor.

77
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,180
I'll take my leave.

78
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,500
Take your time. Bye.

79
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,700
Alright, Mr. Pei.

80
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,500
Thank you for coming.

81
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,620
I made this today.

82
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,540
You can try and tell me

83
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,380
if you like it.

84
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,140
How is it?

85
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,620
Did you accidentally
add sugar instead of salt?

86
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,500
It's so sweet.

87
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,140
How's that possible? Let me taste it.

88
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,380
No, it's normal.

89
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,860
You little liar.

90
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,500
Maybe it's because you're so sweet

91
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,260
that even the air smells sweet.

92
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,260
Where did you learn

93
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,020
these cheesy words, huh?

94
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,260
Try this one.

95
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,940
Cheng Yu,

96
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,540
you smile more often now.

97
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,220
I am really happy.

98
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,660
To be honest,

99
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,700
thank you for helping me.

100
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,620
In the past, I only wanted
to reclaim Hongye Group

101
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,140
and escape from Zhou Jin.

102
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,140
It was you

103
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,460
who made me realize

104
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,260
that life can be
so simple and beautiful.

105
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,620
I want

106
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,740

00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,020
You're increasingly important to me.

Are you going to

110
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,300
give me a love confession?

111
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,700
I... I just want to express
my feelings for you.

112
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,100
My gratitude towards you.

113
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,370
I feel the same.

114
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,900
I'm doing this

115
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,940
not just because of our partnership,

116
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,620
but also because

117
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,420
you are Cheng Yu.

118
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,780
Thank you.

119
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,660
Mr. Pei, don't get me wrong.

120
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,860
When I say important,
I mean you're my friend.

121
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,660
After all, you are

122
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,220
my most important friend.

123
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,220
Just a friend?

124
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,660
Hurry up and eat.

125
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,580
It's getting cold.

Mr. Zhou,

129
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,860
since Ms. Cheng

130
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,260
decided to work with Bang Yun Group,

131
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,420
she's been close to Pei Zheng.

132
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,420
(Cheng Yu,)

133
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,820
(so that's why you moved out.)

134
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,090
(Don't think you can use Pei Zheng
to get rid of me.)

135
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,740
Yu, something bad happened.

136
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,980
Zhou Jin came back yesterday

137
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,380
and shut down our food production.

138
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,460
We are now disqualified
from the bidding.

139
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,900
- What?
- We only have one choice.

140
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,740
We must find a new factory

141
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,820
and establish
a new food production chain.

142
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,690
Don't worry, I can solve this.

143
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,940
Previously, at Zhou Jin's place,

144
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,900
I left a contact list
for other factories.

145
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,540
I will go get it.

146
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,340
Zhou Jin?

147
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,270
Zhou Jin?

148
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,500
Why didn't you tell me you came back?

149
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,500
What are you looking at?

150
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,060
Zhou Jin,

151
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,740
how dare you question
what I'm looking at?

152
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,300
I just made some progress
with the bidding,

153
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,060
and you shut down my production line.

154
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,010
Zhou Jin,

155
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,500
you can torture me however you like,

156
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,180
but can you think about

157
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,220
my employees?

158
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,420
I just came back.

159
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,590
I didn't

160
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,780
give the order.

161
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,780
If you withdraw from the bidding,

162
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,180
it will be resolved.

163
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,300
Withdraw?

164
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,700
Zhou Jin, don't forget,

165
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,160
since the day you stopped
funding Hongye Group,

166
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,180
we've been over.

167
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,160
What do you mean?

168
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,620
Haven't I made myself clear enough?

169
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,800
All these years,

170
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,910
I have endured your maltreatment

171
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,420
only because of the small favor

172
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,420
you did for Hongye Group.

173
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,580
But now...

174
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,460
Let me go,

175
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,980
or we'll go down together.

176
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,540
You've been close to Pei Zheng,

177
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,980
and now you speak with confidence.

178
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,380
That's right.

179
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,380
I'm indeed close to him.

180
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,180
It seems

181
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,060
I have to tell you a secret.

182
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,100
I'm not interested.

183
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,060
Cheng Yu!

184
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,020
Do you know who caused

185
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,100
Pei Zheng's mom's death?
