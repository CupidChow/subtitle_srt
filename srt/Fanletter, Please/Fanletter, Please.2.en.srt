1
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,019
Do you think I granted your wish
so you could gloat to people?

2
00:00:16,489 --> 00:00:19,719
Mom can't write letters back to me!

3
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:28,300
(Dear Mom, whom I love)

00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:43,649
(Mom, Yu Na, Dad, Grandma)

5
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:45,179
(Mom. It's me, Yu Na.
The weather is really nice today.)

6
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,420
My grandma told me
that you looked like Han Kang Hee.

7
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:55,490
Whenever people tell me I'm pretty
and ask who I take after,

8
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:58,329
I didn't know how to answer.

9
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:00,299
But I guess I take after you.

10
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:03,939
Oh, right. Dad might be sad,

11
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,900
so this is a secret between us.

12
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,670
You take after me.

13
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,750
Hey.

14
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,120
How's Yu Na?

15
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,459
- She's sleeping.
- I see.

16
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:27,329
- Hey, Yoon Do.
- What?

17
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,890
Should I just tell her the truth?

18
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,500
About what?

19
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:34,469
That Han Kang Hee's reply
was actually written by me.

20
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,000
Now? Why?

21
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:41,969
I didn't realize Yu Na was so serious
about the reply.

22
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:44,010
She was always serious.

23
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:46,780
Yu Na was really serious
about Santa Claus last year.

24
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,560
Anyways, kids forget after time.

25
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:00,459
Santa hires the parents
to do his work for him.

26
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:01,989
It's not like he really
comes to your house.

27
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,500
That's true.

28
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:08,830
It's not like
Han Kang Hee would come here.

29
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,870
Hey. Come down for some ice cream.

30
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,770
Or should I come up?

31

Let's go, Kang Hee.

34
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:41,900
Down on Garden Street,

35
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,740
there is a lot of delicious food.

38
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,090
Kang Hee, I think this is it.

39
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:10,800
Oh, you're right.

40
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,569
- What are you doing? Go inside.
- Why me?

41
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:20,610
"Why me?" You're my manager.

42
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:24,409
Gosh. I can't do anything
without Ms. Yoon's permission.

Hoon.

- Kang Hee.

Han Kang Hee.

46
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,520
Think about what would happen
if the Korean Wave Queen, Han Kang Hee,

47
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,219
showed up at a room
of a children's hospital...

Right?

52
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,000
But still,

53
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,610
if you're so concerned about that,
shouldn't you take off your sunglasses?

- Enjoy.
- We will.

83
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,089
What? A reply?

84
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,199
Do you mean you replied in my place?

85
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:09,000
I didn't think
things would blow up like this.

86

I'm really sorry.

87

for something I didn't even do.

I hate it more than anything.

92

Tell her the truth right away.

93
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:46,699

103
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,000
seeing you gives her energy.

104
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:17,240

if a kid like her wailed...

107

00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:30,680
I know, Kang Hee.

109
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,850
The fan letters you get...

110

329
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:31,849
Hey, it's Linear Equations.

330
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:37,789
Linear Equations?

331
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,190
What kind of name is that?

332
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,259
What?

333
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:42,690
That's just his nickname.
His real name is Jung Seok.

334
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:43,890
Bang Jung Seok.

335
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,130
His name is funny, right?

336
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:52,569
I'm not sure if it's funny,
but I sure won't forget it.

337
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:56,170
Is he our age?

338
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,440
- Yes.
- Yes.

339
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,980
He just transferred here last week...

340
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,279
while you were away.

341
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:02,809
By the way,

342
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:04,680
don't you think he looks really cool?

343
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:07,180
I heard he was super popular
at his previous school too.

344
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:12,420
Just from a glance,
I can tell he's full of himself.

345
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,720
He must be nosy too.

346
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:15,690
Hey, don't be biased.

347
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:20,400
There are a lot of girls
who have their eyes on him.

348
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:23,630
Sun Min said
she'd confess to him next week,

349
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:25,640
so I'll take this opportunity...

350
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,000
to tell him first.

351
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Really?

352
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,609
- Are you really going to tell him?
- Yes.

353
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,980
You and Sun Min have such bad taste.

354
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:33,880
He's not handsome at all.

355
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,549
Hey.

356
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:40,549
It's because you only see handsome guys
when you go to your shoots.

357
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,250
It's not the same for us.

358
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:00,470
Hey, Kang Hee.

359
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:15,950
Do you think we can recruit
Han Kang Hee as a guest?

360
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:19,589
We'd get so many listeners
if we could get her to come in now.

361
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:20,859
It'd be awesome.

362
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:25,500
You must be close to
all your high school classmates.

363
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,700
I'm a people person,
but I'm not close to everybody.

364
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,970
Still, you're in the same industry.
Didn't you get in touch with her again?

365
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:35,970
For me, it's really nice to see people
from my hometown.

(Serendipitous Fate, I'm Gu Hye Ri)

367
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,880
- Do you know why?
- Why?

368
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,240
It's because
you come from the countryside.

369
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,049
Oh, that's why.

370
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:45,420
You're so smart. How did you know that?

371
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,589
It was because
I grew up in the countryside.

372
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:51,150
Hye Ri is from a different hometown.

373
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,519
Right, that's why.

374
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:56,559
Bang Jung Seok?

375
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,299
Here it is.

376
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,069
Thank you.

I knew it.

382

Kang Hee.

383
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:34,059
You're so wrong
for scripting this whole thing.

384
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,970
How can you take advantage
of a sick child?

385
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:39,339
My goodness.

386
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:47,140
Gosh.

Mister!

388
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,250
Can you pass the ball?

- Mister?
- Mister.

- Mister.
- Hey.

394
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,339
Thank you.

395
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:21,880
Hello?

396
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,410
Mom, it's me. Dong Gu.

397
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,180
- Yu Na, pass the spoon.
- This is Yu Na's dad's phone.

398
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,849
Are you finished?

399
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:31,650
I'm about to go eat dinner too.

400
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:33,319
I'm going to eat too.

401
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:37,690
Make sure to eat fully-cooked food.

402
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,930
You can't have anything cold
like ice cream, okay?

403
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:41,660
You can't eat whatever you want
just because I'm...

404
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,700
I know. I'm not a kid.

405
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:46,000
Yes, you are.

406
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,670
Yu Na's dad is here too.

407

Don't worry.

408

Right. I'm going to sleep here tonight.

409

No, you can't.
It's bad manners to stay that long.

410
00:27:56,309 --> 00:27:58,420
Kang Hee said I could.

411
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,819
I'll go back tomorrow, okay?

412
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,390

She'll be disappointed
when she finds out Dong Gu's my son.

There are a lot of foods to avoid,
so this is what I prepared.

I'm not sure if you'll like it.

427

I like everything.

- Yes.

- Yes.

- What should we do?

- Can we play Mafia?
- Mafia?

That's a good idea.

Thank you for the food.

438
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,589
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

439
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,130
- Do you want some eggplant, Dong Gu?
- No.

440
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,160
- You're not going to try it?
- No.

441
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,000
You have to eat this to grow tall.

442
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,859
Yu Na can eat it.

443

- Here.
- I don't think so.

444

No?

445
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,450
They must've been worn out.

446
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,490
You must be tired too.

- Thank you for today.
- It was nothing.

448
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,559
I really had fun today.

449
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,200
Should we go to bed now?

- What?
- What?

452
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:38,980
Right. You should sleep in your room.

453
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,279
Yes...

454
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,710
- You know what I mean, right?
- Yes.

455
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,720
Do you want to have a beer?

456
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,660
- Together?
- Together.

457
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,430
That would be nice.

458
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:10,269
I'm sorry I asked Yu Na about her mom.

459
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,339
It's okay.

460
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,839
You didn't do it on purpose.

461
00:31:14,109 --> 00:31:15,349
It's fine.

462
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,089
Then...

463
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,859
Have you been raising Yu Na alone?

464
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,369
- How cool.
- Good job.

465
00:31:37,369 --> 00:31:38,640
My daughter is so beautiful.

466
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,970
Yu Na.
I made a character lunchbox for you.

467
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,240
Look.

468
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,740
One, two, three.

469
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,579
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.

470
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:49,309
- Where did the eyes go?
- They fell off.

471
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:50,579
They got stuck.

472
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:53,049
- Put them back on.
- I'll put them back on for you.

473
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:54,119
He's putting them back on.

474
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:56,589
- This one's fine.
- Hold on.

475
00:31:56,589 --> 00:31:59,289
- The eyes and the nose disappeared.
- Not this one.

476
00:32:12,339 --> 00:32:13,470
Slowly.

477
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:20,279
Yu Na.

478
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,079
Do you miss your mom?

479
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,349
Do I have a mom too?

480
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,519
Of course.

481
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:28,890
All babies are born with a mom.

482
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,890
However,

483
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:35,529
Mom can't come to see you right now.

484
00:32:36,029 --> 00:32:37,160
Why not?

485
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,369
Because she's really far away.

486
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:44,230
She's in the US.

487
00:32:44,569 --> 00:32:45,900
Do you know where that is?

488
00:32:47,869 --> 00:32:52,740
You have to fly for a full day
on a plane to get there.

489
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,339
It's very far.

490
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:04,589
Mom.

491
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:06,720
You can get to the US
in 12 hours these days.

492
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:08,660
- Is that so?
- Yes.

493
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,259
Yu Na.

494
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,160
Should I take you on a plane ride?

495
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,829
A plane ride?

496
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:18,200
Yes. Just a second.

497
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,440
We're going on a plane. Hold tight.

498
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,640
Ladies and gentlemen,

499
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,039
this is Dad speaking.

500
00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:27,839
All passengers, please hold on tight.

501
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,210
We're lifting off.

502
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,779
Hold on!

503
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,990
- This is fun!
- Dad!

504
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:39,819
Dad!

505
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,420
- Are you having fun?
- Yes!

506
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,460
Let's go to Japan!

507
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,190
Then to France!

508
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,660
Then to the US!

509
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:50,930
It's the weekend. Go home and rest.
Then go straight to work on Monday.

510
00:33:51,569 --> 00:33:54,839
A lawyer must look clean
or people will criticize you.

511
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,470
I'm almost there.

512
00:33:57,539 --> 00:33:59,440
I'll be right up. Okay.

513
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:11,389
Right.

514
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,659
Yu Na, your dad needs some rest,
so let's go back to the hospital.

515
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:40,780
Hey, Bunny.

516
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,550
My dad has a mom too.

517
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:50,449
But my grandma can't come to see my dad.

518
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,190
It's because...

519
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,360
she went somewhere very far.

520
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:58,630
Where?

521
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,829
Up above.

522
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:06,639
Do you know where that is?

523
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:09,809
I heard it was a place...

524
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:13,280
that only people who turned into angels,
like my grandma, can go.

525
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,250
Right, Dad?

526
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,530
Yu Na...

527
00:36:36,869 --> 00:36:38,530
Your grandma...

528
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,059
I think I understand...

529
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,329
why you went so far as to lie...

530
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,300
to make Yu Na's wish come true.

531
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:16,110
Hey. Thanks to that wish,
I get to visit a celebrity's house.

532
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,469
Friends are nice.

533
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,409
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

534
00:37:26,019 --> 00:37:29,489
Hey. Do you know how surprised
I was to see you that day?

535
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,659
You were a lawyer at the top law firm
in Korea,

536
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:35,460
so I never expected to see you
in the middle of Gangnam like that.

537
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,230
I know.

538
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,960
- What?
- What?

539
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:44,769
How did you know I was a lawyer?

540
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,039
What?

541
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:51,110
- I guessed.
- What?

542
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,840
You went to Seoul National University
Law School with top scores.

543
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,050
Then you would've been
a judge, prosecutor, or lawyer.

544
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:04,650
Right.

545
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,590
- Do you want another beer?
- Yes.

546
00:38:11,929 --> 00:38:12,960
Okay.

547
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:24,170
Is it possible to guess that right?

548
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:28,539
She's incredible.

549
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,489
Oh, no!

550
00:38:36,489 --> 00:38:39,119
- What is this? Hold on.
- Hold on!

551
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:52,070
Jung Seok, the only T-shirts I have
are in these colors.

552
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,039
- Is that okay?
- I see.

553
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,769
Kang Hee. I'm fine. I didn't get that wet.

554
00:38:56,769 --> 00:38:58,170
What? You need to change.

555
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,980
You need clothes to sleep in anyway.

556
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,610
And it's not for your benefit.

557
00:39:04,849 --> 00:39:06,920
It's for the sake of my eyes.

558
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,460
I don't know if anything would fit.

559
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,519
You look very excited.

560
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:16,829
- Me?
- Yes.

561
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:18,090
- I look excited?
- Very.

562
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:21,559
Gosh. No, I am very sorry about this.

563
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:22,699
- Really?
- Yes.

564
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,329
I don't need to change.

565
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,239
Jung Seok, you...

566
00:39:28,469 --> 00:39:30,670
- What?
- You look like you peed your pants.

567
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:34,480
- No wonder it felt damp.
- Hey, put this on.

568
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,960
You look good in pink.

569
00:39:49,329 --> 00:39:51,389
- Come over here.
- What?

570
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,630
Hey. Just once.

571
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,800
Come...

572
00:40:02,909 --> 00:40:04,739
My armpits can't breathe.

573
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,739
Ta-da. This is the last one.

574
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,650
- Kang Hee.
- Yes?

575
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,420
You have a lot of clothes in your closet,

576
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:17,119
so I'm wondering if
I had to put on clothes like this?

577
00:40:17,489 --> 00:40:18,690
- Jung Seok.
- Yes?

578
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,489
There are no such things as bad clothes.

579
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,059
What's important is
who and how they wear them.

580
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:25,230
Who dresses someone with what intent
isn't important?

581
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,630
- What?
- It's nothing.

582
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:31,070
- Did you take a weird photo? Let me see.
- I didn't.

583
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,739
- I'll pose for the camera.
- No.

584
00:40:32,739 --> 00:40:34,039
I'll pose. Give it to me.

585
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,519
Are you okay?

586
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,449
Yes.

587
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,920
(67 Selected)

588
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:25,250
Hey. What are you doing?

589
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:26,760
Hey, you...

590
00:41:28,659 --> 00:41:29,690
Did you erase it?

591
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:30,929
Why did you erase it?

592
00:41:30,929 --> 00:41:32,929
I was going to look at them
when I felt depressed!

593
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:34,130
Darn it.

594
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,400
I'm going to recover them
from the trash can.

595
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:41,639
I'm going to bed.

596
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,449
Why would he touch my hair?

597
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,650
(Kang Hee)

598
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,590
When did she send me this?

599
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:31,119
Good night.

600
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:36,030
Still, I'll delete this one.

601
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,130
(Delete for me)

602
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,699
(Good night.)

603
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:46,900
Thanks for today. Good night to you too.

604

(Exclusive, Actress Han Kang Hee's Story
With Leukemia Patient Was All Lies)

605
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:15,059
I'm having breakfast with my fans.

606
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:18,260
I should look presentable.

607
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,699
Right?

608
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:22,059
Make it look as natural as possible.

(Heo Hoon, Manager)

This is for Dong Gu.

611
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:39,949
And Yu Na.

612
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,090
- Dad.
- Yes?

00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:49,659
Why isn't Kang Hee coming?

614
00:44:49,989 --> 00:44:51,190
She'll be here soon.

615
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,699
Excuse me, Ms. Han.

616
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:56,329
Come and have breakfast.

617
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,000
Kids, do you want to start eating?

618
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:05,039
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

619
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,250
Kang Hee, are you up?

620
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:12,510
The kids have to eat,
so I made breakfast.

621
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,449
Kang Hee, are you asleep?

622
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,699
Did you call me?

What? Yes.

Come and have breakfast.

625
00:46:09,369 --> 00:46:11,110
It smells so good.

626
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:16,449
I hear you're a good cook.
I guess that's true.

627
00:46:19,949 --> 00:46:22,019
Then you should've woken me.

628
00:46:22,849 --> 00:46:24,989
I just got up, so I'm totally bare-faced.

Why are you looking at me like that?

630
00:46:30,059 --> 00:46:31,289
You're wearing makeup...

631
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:35,000
Did you not get to wash up
before going to bed last night?

632
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,699
What's for breakfast?

633
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:38,329
I'm so curious.

634
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,800
Wait, Kang Hee. Go and wash up first.
I'll wait.

635
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,670
- How could she be so shameless?
- I know, right?

636
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:45,809
Coming to visit, making donations...

637
00:46:45,809 --> 00:46:47,539
- It was all a show.
- I know.

638
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:54,250
I hear Yu Na's dad got money...

639
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,820
from Han Kang Hee.

640
00:46:56,289 --> 00:46:58,789
Just because they filmed that video?

641
00:46:59,789 --> 00:47:01,619
They used his sick daughter's story.

642
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:03,460
I guess he asked for that much.

643
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:07,159
I mean, for Han Kang Hee,
this is to boost her public image.

But isn't Yu Na's dad just unbelievable?

You're even prettier, Yu Na.

652
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,980
Kang Hee, can I come over again next time?

00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:02,849
and just come on your own.

658
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:04,750
Hey, Han Kang Hee.

659
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:05,989
Why? What?

660
00:48:06,019 --> 00:48:08,460
- What?
- What? Why did you call my name?

661
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,059
Do you even know linear equations?

662
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:12,329
Are you looking down on me?

663
00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:13,559
- What about you?
- Then tell me.

664
00:48:13,659 --> 00:48:15,599
- I even know quadratic equations.
- Tell me.

665
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,699
When did you two become so close?

666
00:48:18,369 --> 00:48:19,500
- What?
- What?

667
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:22,670
Well...

668
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:24,909
- That is...
- We...

669
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:26,909
decided to be friends.

670
00:48:26,909 --> 00:48:29,239
Kang Hee and I are friends now.

671
00:48:29,309 --> 00:48:30,349
Friends.

672
00:48:30,349 --> 00:48:31,449
Really?

673
00:48:32,679 --> 00:48:33,750
- Shall we go now?
- Okay.

674
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:34,980
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

675
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,559
Why did you follow us to the hospital?

676
00:48:45,659 --> 00:48:49,059
I'm not following you.
I have my own schedule too.

677
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:55,070
Hey, Manager.

678
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:56,170
Kang Hee.

679
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:58,210
Why won't you answer your phone?

680
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:59,440
Gosh, you startled me.

681
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:01,809
I was just busy with some stuff. Why?

682
00:49:01,809 --> 00:49:03,280
You're still home, right?

683
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,809
What? No, I'm out.

684
00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:07,150
Then in that case...

685
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:09,150
Are you with that kid's dad?

686
00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:10,690
Yes. Why?

687
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:11,820
Well...

688
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,059
Okay, then see them off and stay at home.

689
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:18,059
I'm going to the hospital with Yu Na.

690
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:20,059
I said I would buy some expensive snacks
for everyone there.

691
00:49:20,059 --> 00:49:21,500
I should go and take the credit.

692
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,730
Have you not seen the article yet?

693
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:26,539
The article? What article?

694
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:29,440
An article claims
that you bought that kid's dad...

695
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,340
and released that video.

696
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:33,039
What, I bought him? Me?

697
00:49:34,809 --> 00:49:38,510
Anyway, go home before you meet
any reporters.

698
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:39,780
Hurry, okay?

699
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:41,150
Okay.

700
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:44,420
What's up?

701
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:45,489
What?

702
00:49:45,489 --> 00:49:47,190
Apparently, there was an article.

703
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,860
Here they come. Take the picture.

704
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,159
- Here they come.
- Here they are.

705
00:49:54,929 --> 00:49:56,199
What do you think you're doing?

706
00:49:56,199 --> 00:49:57,769
- Please look over here.
- Ms. Han.

707
00:49:57,769 --> 00:50:00,699
There have been claims that the story
about you and your sick fan was staged.

708
00:50:00,699 --> 00:50:02,699
- Do you have anything to say?
- Please say something.

709
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:05,969
Please answer the question.

710
00:50:07,909 --> 00:50:09,309
Please tell us what you think.

711
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:10,980
You're Bang Yu Na's father, right?

712
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:12,650
How much money did you get from Ms. Han?

713
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:14,050
Look here. What do you mean by that?

714
00:50:14,179 --> 00:50:15,619
Do you think
you can say whatever you want?

715
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:18,420
Then are you two lovers?

716
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:20,260
- Excuse me?
- Then what else would it be?

717
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:21,989
If this isn't for money
and you two aren't lovers,

718
00:50:21,989 --> 00:50:23,530
why would you come out of the same house?

719
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:25,889
Did you guys have a school reunion?

720
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:29,059
We already know everything.

721
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:31,369
We looked into it,
and you're a single dad.

722
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:35,440
Hey. You can speak to me.

723
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,110
Is that all you found out about me?

724
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:39,670
I'm a lawyer.

725
00:50:39,909 --> 00:50:43,980
I won't stop you from publishing
everything you just said.

726
00:50:44,349 --> 00:50:46,179
However, I will sue you
for compensation...

727
00:50:46,179 --> 00:50:47,579
for the malicious
and speculative reports...

728
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:49,420
and for defamation.

729
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:58,829
Kang Hee.

730
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,460
Did you and Yu Na's dad know each other?

731
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,329
What?

732
00:51:03,329 --> 00:51:05,030
Then why did you lie?

733
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,639
That is...

734
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:13,880
Kang Hee.

735
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:16,110
The letters you sent me...

736
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:19,010
Did you write them yourself?

737
00:51:20,449 --> 00:51:22,420
You wrote them, right?

738
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:24,489
You really did write them,

739
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:26,519
didn't you?

740
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:30,289
Why can't you answer?

741
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,260
Didn't you write them?

742
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:36,630
Yu Na, stop.

743
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,769
I told all the kids.

744
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:41,769
My mom can't write back to me,

745
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:44,840
so Kang Hee wrote to me instead.

746
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,010
That's what I told the kids.

747
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,460
Yu Na.

748
00:52:07,159 --> 00:52:08,460
Those letters...

749
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:12,829
I didn't write them.

750
00:52:16,969 --> 00:52:19,340
Ms. Han, did you just admit
that the story was fake?

751
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:21,739
- Ms. Han. Please tell us the truth.
- Answer our questions.

752
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:22,809
Give us a moment.

753
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:24,579
- Ms. Han. Look over here.
- Do you admit it was staged?

754
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:29,519
- Yu Na.
- Give us a statement.

755
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:31,989
- You're bleeding.
- Take the picture!

756
00:52:31,989 --> 00:52:34,119
- Is she okay?
- Please back up.

757
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:58,250
Yu Na, we're here now.
Hang in there, okay?

758
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,280
Yu Na!

759
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,449
You can't come in.

760
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,619
- What do we do?
- Will Yu Na be okay?

761
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:29,309
- Yu Na's dad?
- Yes.

762
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,349
(Restricted area)

763
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:56,099
(Bang Yu Na)

764
00:54:11,789 --> 00:54:13,489
(Bang Yu Na)

765
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:15,820
She's such a big fan, right?

766
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,139
This is a really old picture.

767
00:54:32,909 --> 00:54:35,440
These pictures aren't just pictures.

768
00:54:37,309 --> 00:54:38,349
They're talismans.

769
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:41,179
Talismans that keep Yu Na from being sick.

770
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:03,909
Hi. I'm Han Kang Hee.

771
00:55:03,909 --> 00:55:05,409
It's nice to meet you.

772
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,340
You look so pretty.

773
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:10,079
But I look even prettier, right?

774
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,750
What's that?

775
00:55:14,179 --> 00:55:15,780
This is how Yu Na and I play.

776
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:18,389
When she has no energy after chemo,

777
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,059
I play with her like this.

778
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:23,360
And even for a little while,
Yu Na smiles for me.

779
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:30,199
Kang Hee. Just know...

780
00:55:31,969 --> 00:55:35,800
how big your presence is
in this tiny hospital room.

781
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,320
Maybe I should've lied.

782
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,260
That I did write those letters.

783
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:01,329
Did I not tell you?

784
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,630
Yu Na is the master
of figuring things out.

785
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:12,710
It was bound to be revealed someday.

786
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:15,480
But not like this.

787
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:17,780
It was all because of me.

788
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:19,809
Kang Hee.

789
00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:24,750
It wasn't because of you.
It was because of me.

790
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:33,090
(Dear Kang Hee,
From Yu Na)

791
00:56:34,829 --> 00:56:35,900
I told you.

792
00:56:36,099 --> 00:56:38,800
This happened because I wrote back
pretending to be you.

793
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:42,800
I know it's late,
but I'll give these back.

794
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:52,179
Right.

795
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:57,750
(Dear Kang Hee,
From Yu Na)

796
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:00,489
Thanks.

797
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:05,389
(Dear Kang Hee,
From Yu Na)

798
00:57:18,869 --> 00:57:21,110
What is it? Are you okay?

799
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:26,079
Jung Seok, I'm sorry,
but could you put these away?

800
00:57:26,679 --> 00:57:27,679
Yes, sure.

801
00:58:48,099 --> 00:58:51,530
(Fanletter, Please)

802
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:54,440
Someone put a letter and a present
in your locker.

803
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:57,610
What did you do with the box
that was in your locker?

804
00:58:57,940 --> 00:58:59,570
This is my first time coming back here
since graduation.

805
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:01,409
It would be a shame to leave
just like this.

806
00:59:01,409 --> 00:59:02,980
- Who's there?
- Run!

807
00:59:03,949 --> 00:59:05,980
Did something happen between those two
back in high school?

808
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:07,320
He was totally her minion.

809
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,480
I should work hard.

810
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:11,090
- This is about school violence.
- Please just once!

811
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:13,989
You can pretend to suddenly like someone,
but you can't pretend to hate.

812
00:59:13,989 --> 00:59:15,519
Will you keep running away?

813
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:17,429
- Han Kang Hee.
- Let go of me!

814
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:21,000
This is all because
you butted into my life...

815
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,829
with that fan letter.

816
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:34,280
This is the lawyer
who will be representing us.

817
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,980
He's the best when it comes to
making Internet trolls cry for mercy.

818
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:39,150
(Epilogue)

819
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:49,820
Goodness, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

820
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:51,059
- Hello.
- Hello.

821
00:59:53,329 --> 00:59:55,360
- Can we get some water?
- Let's take a seat.

822
00:59:56,969 --> 00:59:58,269
(Attorney Bang Jung Seok)

823
01:00:04,409 --> 01:00:06,409
(Geosong Law Firm)

824
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:14,349
(Attorney Bang Jung Seok)

825
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:21,619
(Geosong Law Firm)

826
01:00:30,469 --> 01:00:32,530
Excuse me. What are you doing?

827
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,210
Is this Mr. Bang Jung Seok's office?

828
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:41,340
He no longer works here.

829
01:00:52,219 --> 01:00:54,059
How did you know I was a lawyer?

830
01:00:56,989 --> 01:00:58,559
- I guessed.
- What?

831
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:02,599
You went to Seoul National University
Law School with top scores.

832
01:01:03,099 --> 01:01:05,800
Then you would've been
a judge, prosecutor, or lawyer.

833
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:09,300
I see.

834
01:01:13,539 --> 01:01:16,780
Why did I bring up "lawyer" right then?

835
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:19,480
Gosh, it looks like
you did research on him.

836
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:23,750
- Here.
- Thanks.

837
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:27,820
Oh, no!

838
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:30,260
- What is this? Hold on.
- Hold on!

839
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,099
Hey, did you do this on purpose?

840
01:01:35,099 --> 01:01:36,159
What?

841
01:01:38,199 --> 01:01:39,199
I really didn't.

842
01:01:41,539 --> 01:01:42,539
I'm opening yours.

843
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,110
Wait.

844
01:01:44,309 --> 01:01:46,510
- No, I really didn't.
- You did it on purpose.
