(MBC Drama Script Contest Winner)

2
00:00:14,778 --> 00:00:16,818
If they were just feelings
that would change easily...

3
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:19,388
If that's all those feelings were,

4
00:00:20,117 --> 00:00:22,058
why did they bother liking me
in the first place?

5
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:25,288
Kang Hee.

6
00:00:26,357 --> 00:00:27,827
The reason people say those things...

7
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:29,098
Don't try to make me understand them.

8
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:33,938
For me, my mother, who gave birth to me,

9
00:00:33,938 --> 00:00:35,697
my closest friends,

10
00:00:35,837 --> 00:00:37,737
and my fans, who adored me,

11
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:41,078
all changed in the end.

12
00:00:54,987 --> 00:00:56,017
What about you?

13
00:00:57,587 --> 00:00:58,658
Can you...

14
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:02,328
promise me that you'll never change?

15
00:01:14,678 --> 00:01:16,707
Forget it. You can go.

16
00:01:23,987 --> 00:01:25,048
Kang Hee.

17
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:27,218
Are you okay?

18
00:01:38,127 --> 00:01:39,168
Are you okay?

19
00:01:41,397 --> 00:01:42,468
I'm fine.

20
00:01:44,808 --> 00:01:47,808
(Final Episode)

21
00:01:54,817 --> 00:01:55,877
Come in.

22
00:02:03,017 --> 00:02:04,127
Why are you standing there?

23
00:02:16,638 --> 00:02:18,367
This place will be empty
until Yu Na gets discharged,

24
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:19,707
so make yourself at home.

25
00:02:19,838 --> 00:02:22,607
That's Yu Na's room, and that's my room.

26
00:02:23,778 --> 00:02:25,047
You should sleep in my room.

27
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:26,977
My bed should fit you.

28
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,618
I wasn't asking to borrow your place.

29
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:35,718
You don't have anywhere to go right now.

30
00:02:36,428 --> 00:02:38,227
Isn't that why you came to me?

31
00:02:49,197 --> 00:02:51,507
It should have the basics you need,
so go ahead and use them.

32
00:02:56,748 --> 00:02:59,278
Please let me make it up to you
for the fan letter.

33
00:02:59,507 --> 00:03:01,077
It would make me feel better.

34
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:04,188
This is all...

35
00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:09,658
because you got involved in my life
with those fan letters.

36
00:03:12,787 --> 00:03:13,998
Do you even know?

37
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:27,908
It's true I don't have anywhere to go,

38
00:03:29,778 --> 00:03:31,278
but I came because of you.

39
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:36,218
You were the only one I could think of.

40
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,787
I didn't come to you last...

41
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,188
after checking in with other people.

42
00:03:52,067 --> 00:03:53,768
That must be your manager.

43
00:04:01,977 --> 00:04:03,607
- I'll text you.
- Okay.

44
00:04:04,347 --> 00:04:05,347
Also,

45
00:04:05,347 --> 00:04:07,648
I can't stay with her all the time.

46
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:11,588
Can you please check from time to time
to see if she's eating properly?

47
00:04:11,588 --> 00:04:14,058
Of course. I'm her manager, after all.

48
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:15,988
- Please don't worry.
- Thank you.

49
00:04:15,988 --> 00:04:17,528
Delivery for Unit 202.

50
00:04:18,327 --> 00:04:20,257
- We didn't order...
- I did.

51
00:04:23,398 --> 00:04:25,097
- Bye.
- Enjoy.

52
00:04:27,398 --> 00:04:29,138
It's what Kang Hee loves the most.

53
00:04:29,138 --> 00:04:30,838
She eats chicken feet when stressed.

54
00:04:32,737 --> 00:04:33,977
But...

55
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,078
I don't think she's in the mood...

56
00:04:36,177 --> 00:04:37,208
That hurts!

57
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,378
Did my chicken feet come?

58
00:04:43,318 --> 00:04:44,547
Bye, Jung Seok.

59
00:04:48,117 --> 00:04:49,318
I'll go in too.

60
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:53,398
This smells insanely good.

61
00:04:53,528 --> 00:04:54,958
Did you add the cheese topping?

62
00:04:55,297 --> 00:04:57,997
- Of course. Who do you take me for?
- Good job.

63
00:04:59,997 --> 00:05:01,367
This is tasty.

64
00:05:03,468 --> 00:05:04,537
Gosh.

65
00:05:06,508 --> 00:05:08,477
Now I feel better.

66
00:05:16,018 --> 00:05:17,617
If you don't play, you lose.
Rock, paper, scissors!

67
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,787
Yes! Loser!

68
00:05:19,818 --> 00:05:21,018
The loser cleans up, right?

69
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:23,328
No. The winner gets hit on the head.

70
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:24,888
Clean it up.

71
00:05:26,857 --> 00:05:28,097
Thank you for the meal.

72
00:05:29,258 --> 00:05:30,898
But you ate most of it...

73
00:05:36,037 --> 00:05:37,437
I'll get going, Kang Hee.

74
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:38,867
Call me if anything happens.

75
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,908
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

76
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,047
Yes, Ms. Yoon.

77
00:05:49,878 --> 00:05:52,218
Kang Hee is fine.

78
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,357
She's totally okay.

79
00:05:54,518 --> 00:05:55,818
Please don't worry.

80
00:05:56,057 --> 00:05:57,857
I'll be in touch. Okay.

81
00:05:57,987 --> 00:05:59,128
Okay.

82
00:05:59,128 --> 00:06:00,727
All right.

83
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:03,057
Yes. Bye.

84
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:21,977
Apologize!

85
00:06:21,977 --> 00:06:23,487
- You better apologize!
- Apologize!

86
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,648
- Hey!
- Are you guys serious?

87
00:06:25,148 --> 00:06:27,117
Go away!

88
00:06:28,617 --> 00:06:30,088
- Hey, run.
- I told you to stop.

89
00:06:32,328 --> 00:06:33,497
Gosh.

90
00:06:35,497 --> 00:06:37,068
It's permanent.

91
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:38,768
By the way,

92
00:06:38,768 --> 00:06:40,737
she is keeping silent for too long.

93
00:06:40,898 --> 00:06:43,138
Maybe there's some dirt after all.

94
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:46,607
What do you mean?

95
00:06:47,278 --> 00:06:49,177
To be honest,

96
00:06:49,177 --> 00:06:51,307
you don't know what she was like
during her school years either.

97
00:07:01,417 --> 00:07:03,888
What about Gu Hye Ri? Still nothing?

98
00:07:04,727 --> 00:07:05,958
Well...

99
00:07:06,487 --> 00:07:08,758
She got back to us, but...

100
00:07:08,758 --> 00:07:10,997
Okay. What did she say?

101
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:13,297
She has a panic disorder,

102
00:07:13,568 --> 00:07:15,237
so the situation is too difficult for her.

103
00:07:19,008 --> 00:07:23,008
But she's good enough to post
on her social media account, right?

104
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:29,648
I came to prepare for the radio show.

105
00:07:29,818 --> 00:07:33,818
Please look forward to the honest
and cheerful Hye Ri!

106
00:07:33,818 --> 00:07:34,917
Promise?

Hye Ri.

109
00:07:46,838 --> 00:07:48,937
I'm so sorry about last time.

110
00:07:49,097 --> 00:07:52,008
I shouldn't have asked
if you were friends with Kang Hee.

111
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:55,307
It must have made you uncomfortable.

112
00:07:55,638 --> 00:07:58,247
It can happen if you don't know.

113

(Take two pills, twice daily)

114
00:08:05,888 --> 00:08:07,318
Is this it?

115
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,018
Pills for your panic disorder?

116
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:10,487
Yes.

117
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,187
What's the matter?

118
00:08:13,857 --> 00:08:15,028
I think...

119
00:08:15,427 --> 00:08:18,927
I should take this before the recording.

120
00:08:19,128 --> 00:08:20,638
Right. Water?

121
00:08:20,737 --> 00:08:23,297
I'll grab it for you right away.
Hold on just a second.

122
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:26,138
Water.

123
00:08:36,718 --> 00:08:38,648
I said, no!

124
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,218
I can draw better.

125
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,018
I'm good at drawing too.

126
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:56,197
Gosh. Han Kang Hee came.

127
00:09:31,307 --> 00:09:32,467
My gosh.

128
00:09:32,467 --> 00:09:33,778
What are all these?

129
00:09:33,837 --> 00:09:35,337
I thought you might be getting sick
of delivery food.

130
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:37,648
You told me you like to cook.

131
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,587
- By the way...
- Yes?

132
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:49,457
All I could see was you
at the grocery store.

133
00:09:50,228 --> 00:09:52,028
It's harder to find a product
without your face on it.

134
00:09:52,427 --> 00:09:54,098
I bet.

135
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:57,998
You can see a day of the modern man
through the commercials I'm in.

136
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,567
Haven't you heard?

(Half price)

138
00:10:08,437 --> 00:10:09,878
- What's wrong?
- What?

139
00:10:10,547 --> 00:10:11,547
Hey.

140
00:10:11,547 --> 00:10:13,008
Don't buy this ever again.

141
00:10:13,148 --> 00:10:14,378
It's really bad.

142
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:17,047
But you seemed to enjoy it
in the commercial.

143
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:19,717
It's just an act.

144
00:10:21,557 --> 00:10:24,358
I should really sort out
all the commercials...

145
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:27,028
and become a model
who's more conscious and responsible.

146
00:10:27,158 --> 00:10:28,827
I accepted everything that was proposed...

147
00:10:28,827 --> 00:10:30,967
so I could pay back my mom's debt.

148
00:10:38,967 --> 00:10:40,577
- Wait. Give that to me.
- What?

149
00:10:41,177 --> 00:10:42,537
I'll put them away.

150
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,008
It's okay, I can do it.

151
00:10:44,008 --> 00:10:45,608
No, I'll do it.

152
00:10:45,748 --> 00:10:46,807
Hand them over.

153
00:10:47,077 --> 00:10:48,217
What's wrong?

154
00:10:48,217 --> 00:10:50,177
What?

155
00:10:50,248 --> 00:10:52,817
You're acting like
you're hiding something.

156
00:11:33,728 --> 00:11:35,258
Han Kang Hee!

157
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,197
Whatever.

158
00:11:40,297 --> 00:11:42,967
He's the one who begged me to stay here.

159
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:44,937
How could he kick me out
for being a little messy?

160
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:46,837
What if I run into someone?

161
00:11:46,937 --> 00:11:48,337
I'm Actress Han Kang Hee!

162

She should've told me
if she was going to come.

What is this?

167
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:18,868
Gosh.

168
00:12:19,537 --> 00:12:21,908
Why are her windows so tinted?

169
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,278
Does she think she's a celebrity?

170
00:12:24,108 --> 00:12:25,478
I can't see anything because it's so dark.

171
00:12:26,248 --> 00:12:27,348
Hey, lady.

172
00:12:27,978 --> 00:12:29,148
Excuse me?

173
00:12:29,848 --> 00:12:31,618
Don't put any ads on that car.

174
00:12:32,817 --> 00:12:35,587
Hey. My gosh. Hey, lady.

175
00:12:35,917 --> 00:12:38,228
You shouldn't lean on
someone else's car like that.

176
00:12:38,528 --> 00:12:40,398
Hey. Who are you?

177
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:45,868
I'm your actress.

178

What's with that hat?

(Heesong High School 35th Graduation)

180
00:13:02,618 --> 00:13:05,388
Jung Seok, relax. She's like my sister.

181
00:13:05,587 --> 00:13:07,687
I'm comfortable right now.

182
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,317
You don't look it.

183
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:11,528
Right.

184
00:13:11,528 --> 00:13:13,927
So what are your intentions with Kang Hee?

185
00:13:14,797 --> 00:13:15,797
Pardon?

186
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:20,667
If you brought her to your home,

187
00:13:20,768 --> 00:13:22,567
I'm sure there was a reason.

188
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:25,608
I was the one who came to him
and told him I had no place to go.

189
00:13:28,878 --> 00:13:30,378
Why don't you have anywhere to go?

190
00:13:30,378 --> 00:13:32,508
You could've come to my place
or even Hoon's place.

191
00:13:32,508 --> 00:13:34,648
You said your mother-in-law
was at your place.

192
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,148
You said
you didn't want to go home either.

193
00:13:43,687 --> 00:13:45,528
Shut your mouth and have some fruit.
Come on.

194
00:13:46,728 --> 00:13:49,028
- Hurry up and eat.
- How can I shut my mouth and eat?

195
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,628
My goodness.

196
00:13:50,628 --> 00:13:52,398
- That hurts.
- Ms. Yoon.

197

My daughter and I
are staying at the hospital right now.

198
00:13:59,008 --> 00:14:00,738
So this house is empty for the time being.

199
00:14:01,837 --> 00:14:03,478
When things settle down,

200
00:14:03,478 --> 00:14:05,677
I'll be sure to send Kang Hee
home right away.

201
00:14:07,778 --> 00:14:09,547
Okay, then...

202
00:14:13,518 --> 00:14:16,258
By the way, do you own this house?

203
00:14:16,787 --> 00:14:18,388
Why would you ask that?

204
00:14:18,488 --> 00:14:20,927
Yes, I do.

205
00:14:22,098 --> 00:14:23,158
I see.

206
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:26,797
What do you do now?

207
00:14:26,797 --> 00:14:31,037
Oh, right.
I work as a hired driver at night.

208
00:14:31,368 --> 00:14:33,067
I have to take care of my daughter
during the day.

209
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:36,437
A Young, remember the day
I got into a fight with Director Kim?

210
00:14:36,437 --> 00:14:37,908
Jung Seok drove me home.

211
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:39,278
Good for you.

212
00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:42,778
So? What did you do
before your daughter got sick?

213
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,248
I worked as an attorney.

214
00:14:46,388 --> 00:14:47,957
An attendant?

215
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:55,827
I worked as an attorney.

216
00:14:56,358 --> 00:14:58,498
A Young, Jung Seok
went to Seoul National University.

217
00:14:58,628 --> 00:15:00,297
He went to SNU Law School

Oh, no!

220
00:15:10,807 --> 00:15:12,148
I need a tissue!

221
00:15:12,447 --> 00:15:15,217
- May I give her a tissue?
- Sure.

222
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,057
Why are you sitting like that?

223
00:15:21,858 --> 00:15:24,258
- Aren't you uncomfortable?
- No...

224

- Have some fruit too.
- Okay.

225
00:15:25,888 --> 00:15:26,988
Oh, right. I got this.

226
00:15:27,758 --> 00:15:29,398
I didn't know what you'd like.

Thank you.

228

This is good. Where did you get it?

229

Be quiet.

Kang Hee?

240
00:16:03,457 --> 00:16:04,667
You brat.

241
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:07,598
I don't want to eat alone.

242
00:16:12,707 --> 00:16:13,768
Come inside.

243
00:16:20,408 --> 00:16:23,748
A Young is usually a really fun person,

244
00:16:23,748 --> 00:16:25,348
but she must've been nervous to meet you.

245
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,658
But she seems like a good person.

246
00:16:27,658 --> 00:16:28,658
Really?

247
00:16:33,358 --> 00:16:35,028
- It's really good.
- Is it? It's not bland?

248
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:36,057
No.

249
00:16:36,898 --> 00:16:39,467
This is my secret weapon today.

250
00:16:40,128 --> 00:16:42,197
Why isn't Mr. Bang
around as much these days?

251
00:16:42,537 --> 00:16:43,567
Good question.

252
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:47,138
He's usually right by Yu Na's side.
What's going on?

253
00:16:47,138 --> 00:16:48,608
Gosh, he's a man...

254
00:16:48,937 --> 00:16:51,307
I mean, human too.
He needs to relax sometimes.

255
00:16:51,307 --> 00:16:53,778
Oh, my. Does Mr. Bang have a girlfriend?

256
00:16:54,978 --> 00:16:57,047
See? I told you it wasn't Han Kang Hee.

257
00:16:57,047 --> 00:16:58,687
Han Kang Hee?

258
00:16:58,687 --> 00:17:02,118
Remember when the news
about her being a school bully broke?

259
00:17:02,118 --> 00:17:03,787
Han Kang Hee came here.

260
00:17:03,787 --> 00:17:07,258
But when she turned around to leave,

261
00:17:07,258 --> 00:17:09,898
Mr. Bang ran after her.

262
00:17:10,158 --> 00:17:11,697
It was crazy.

263
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:15,138
When the article about
Han Kang Hee going into hiding came out,

264
00:17:15,138 --> 00:17:17,408
Sol Yi's mom wondered
if he took her to his house.

265
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:27,177
Gosh, you've seen too many dramas.

266
00:17:27,378 --> 00:17:29,917
Why would someone like Han Kang Hee
date someone like Jung Seok?

267
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:31,318
I know.

268
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:32,517
Think about it.

269
00:17:32,517 --> 00:17:34,788
Why would Han Kang Hee
date someone who has a kid?

270
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:36,257
- That...
- Why not?

271
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:38,957
They looked good together last time.

272
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:42,227
Besides,
I'm saying this because it's just us,

273
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,598
but if it weren't for Yu Na,

274
00:17:44,598 --> 00:17:46,068
he'd be the ideal guy.

275
00:17:46,068 --> 00:17:49,197
Right, but he has Yu Na.

276
00:17:49,197 --> 00:17:51,638
- That won't do.
- I know.

277
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:53,408
Are you two serious right now?

278
00:17:53,838 --> 00:17:55,608
Why are you treating Yu Na like baggage?

279
00:17:55,638 --> 00:17:57,308
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean?

280
00:17:57,308 --> 00:17:58,507
It's not the first time.

281
00:17:58,507 --> 00:17:59,548
Si Hyun, Sol Yi. Are you guys back?

282
00:17:59,548 --> 00:18:00,578
- Yes.
- I see.

283
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:01,947
Guys, where's Yu Na?

284
00:18:04,088 --> 00:18:05,818
Yu Na just left.

285
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,088
She just left.

286
00:18:07,217 --> 00:18:08,257
- What?
- Where?

287
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:12,588
Where did she go?

288
00:18:22,937 --> 00:18:24,038
This looks so good.

289
00:18:24,108 --> 00:18:25,507
Kang Hee, I'll take out the bones.

290
00:18:46,727 --> 00:18:47,727
It's really good.

291
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:49,398
I'll give you some more.

292
00:18:50,158 --> 00:18:52,298
This time, I'll give you a bigger piece.

293
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:55,737
Hey, doesn't it feel like we're newlyweds?

294
00:18:56,598 --> 00:18:57,608
What?

295
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,237
I'm just kidding.

296
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:02,677
Why are you getting so serious?

297
00:19:04,548 --> 00:19:05,707
It's nothing...

298
00:19:06,447 --> 00:19:08,818
I was wondering what you meant
by newlyweds.

299
00:19:09,477 --> 00:19:10,648
I've never been a newlywed before.

300
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:12,487
I've never been one either.

301
00:19:12,487 --> 00:19:14,457
Why not? You've been one in dramas.

302
00:19:15,017 --> 00:19:17,888
I think I've seen you
wear a wedding dress...

303
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:19,487
at least three times.

304
00:19:19,487 --> 00:19:21,158
What? It's only been three times?

305
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,128
I thought it was four.

306
00:19:23,298 --> 00:19:24,368
Gosh.

307
00:19:25,027 --> 00:19:27,068
You've done something
I've never gotten to do.

308
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:31,267
I've experienced all sorts of weddings
while filming.

309
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:33,568
You can ask me if you have any questions
in the future.

310
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:34,737
Forget it.

311
00:19:35,237 --> 00:19:37,808
I'm going to have a traditional wedding
and wear a hanbok.

312
00:19:38,247 --> 00:19:40,707
A traditional wedding?
I've never done that before.

313
00:19:43,017 --> 00:19:45,118
Oh, really?

314
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:50,088
So you've never done that before?

315
00:19:59,868 --> 00:20:00,937
Hold on.

316
00:20:03,697 --> 00:20:04,838
Hey, Yoon Do.

317
00:20:04,838 --> 00:20:06,207
Jung Seok. Something has happened.

318
00:20:06,937 --> 00:20:08,277
Yu Na disappeared.

319
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:15,947
Yu Na!

320
00:20:30,927 --> 00:20:33,098
- You haven't seen her?
- I can't find her.

321
00:20:34,437 --> 00:20:35,437
You didn't find her?

322
00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:37,338
She's not over there either.

323
00:20:37,467 --> 00:20:38,608
Where did she go?

324
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:41,937
Do you think she went outside?

325
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:52,348
Hold on.

Bang Yu Na!

327
00:21:04,767 --> 00:21:05,767
Dad?

328
00:21:08,497 --> 00:21:10,098
Who said you could come up here alone?

329
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:12,167
What's wrong, Dad?

330
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:14,308
Didn't you see the sign
saying it was dangerous here at night?

331
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:16,638
Jung Seok,
let's take her downstairs first.

332
00:21:16,638 --> 00:21:18,048
Why did you come up by yourself?

333
00:21:19,677 --> 00:21:20,947
I said, why did you come here?

334
00:21:24,177 --> 00:21:25,548
Why are you only scolding me?

335
00:21:25,747 --> 00:21:27,618
You were up here too!

336
00:21:27,757 --> 00:21:29,987
You came up here without me before!

337
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,158
What?

338
00:21:56,378 --> 00:21:57,517
I'm sorry.

339
00:21:58,947 --> 00:22:00,247
It's my fault...

340
00:22:01,457 --> 00:22:02,888
for asking you to have dinner with me.

341
00:22:05,328 --> 00:22:07,727
Why am I such a mess lately?

342
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,757
You really don't listen, do you?

343
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:14,598
It's not your fault. It's mine.

344
00:22:16,538 --> 00:22:17,767
The fan letter,

345
00:22:18,068 --> 00:22:19,507
what happened today,

346
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:21,808
and...

347
00:22:23,908 --> 00:22:25,177
what happened back then.

348
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,888
Soon Young's granddaughter was admitted
to this hospital.

349
00:22:32,288 --> 00:22:36,217
I think she came
so her lawyer son could go to work.

350
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:40,328
She lived all her life supporting her son.

351
00:22:40,328 --> 00:22:43,328
It must be hard for her to go like this.
She's probably worried about her kids.

352
00:22:44,628 --> 00:22:47,598
It's so upsetting.

353
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:46,828
Dad!

354
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:53,368
Dad!

355
00:23:54,838 --> 00:23:56,298
Dad!

356
00:24:34,977 --> 00:24:37,038
I'm so sorry.

357
00:24:55,658 --> 00:24:56,858
And what?

358
00:24:59,828 --> 00:25:01,167
Well...

359
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:04,608
After my mother's funeral last year,

360
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:06,638
I made a promise to myself.

361
00:25:08,578 --> 00:25:12,648
To become a good dad to Yu Na.

362
00:25:13,007 --> 00:25:15,648
I won't leave her side even for a moment.

363
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:18,388
To become a dad who is like Superman.

364
00:25:20,618 --> 00:25:22,017
But...

365
00:25:23,158 --> 00:25:24,828
I keep on forgetting about it these days.

366
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:26,588
You do?

367
00:25:27,227 --> 00:25:28,457
Why?

368
00:25:29,757 --> 00:25:31,267
Because I want to play around.

369
00:25:31,628 --> 00:25:33,197
Play around?

370
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:35,737
Right?

371
00:25:36,937 --> 00:25:38,467
I shouldn't act like this.

372
00:25:41,477 --> 00:25:42,977
After meeting you again,

373
00:25:44,177 --> 00:25:46,977
it felt like I went back in time.

374
00:25:47,648 --> 00:25:50,048
That's why I asked you
to visit our school together...

375
00:25:50,247 --> 00:25:51,917
and to eat together.

376
00:25:52,187 --> 00:25:54,858
I joked around while eating with you.

377
00:25:55,517 --> 00:25:56,888
It was short,

378
00:25:57,588 --> 00:25:59,128
but I think I wanted...

379
00:26:00,588 --> 00:26:01,757
to hang out with you.

380
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:08,267
Enough to forget that I'm a dad.

381
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:13,707
Can I call this...

382
00:26:14,937 --> 00:26:16,608
a change too?

383
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,217
Kang Hee.

384
00:26:24,348 --> 00:26:25,717
I'm so sorry,

385
00:26:30,118 --> 00:26:32,828
but I think
we should stop seeing each other.

386
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:39,598
I think that's the right thing to do.

Everyone in Korea knows...

I side with her at a time like this?

404

I'm not sure.

405
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:27,987
Everything...

406
00:30:28,497 --> 00:30:30,898
will turn around right away.

407
00:30:31,197 --> 00:30:32,427
I see.

408
00:30:33,328 --> 00:30:34,628
It might be hard to believe,

409
00:30:34,628 --> 00:30:36,697
but I wasn't happy
about people criticizing her.

410
00:30:37,868 --> 00:30:40,108
To be frank,

411
00:30:40,237 --> 00:30:41,368
A Young...

412
00:30:41,677 --> 00:30:43,007
I should call you Ms. Yoon now.

413
00:30:43,338 --> 00:30:45,548
Anyway, if Kang Hee plummets,

414
00:30:45,548 --> 00:30:48,318
both you and I will run out of money.

415

You're competent, so you're fine.

416
00:30:51,118 --> 00:30:52,588
But I'm too old.

417
00:30:52,588 --> 00:30:55,088
No one will treat me like this anymore.

418

Well, it's about Kang Hee.

Hello, I'm Actress Han Kang Hee.

424
00:31:16,477 --> 00:31:20,378
First, I would like to apologize
for not addressing...

425
00:31:20,648 --> 00:31:23,648
the various issues surrounding me
for the past few days sooner.

426
00:31:24,348 --> 00:31:26,717
Ever since I was a child actor to now,

427
00:31:26,888 --> 00:31:29,618
every time there
were small and big issues about me,

428
00:31:29,987 --> 00:31:34,027
I realized I never
formally addressed them personally.

429
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,197
The Han Kang Hee you all know,

430
00:31:39,427 --> 00:31:40,868
and the Han Kang Hee I know...

431
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:44,098
might be two different people.

432
00:31:48,277 --> 00:31:49,378
So today,

433
00:31:51,237 --> 00:31:53,148
I would like to share my story.

00:32:05,588 --> 00:32:07,358
(Han Kang Hee)

435
00:32:20,437 --> 00:32:21,638
Like you said,

436
00:32:22,378 --> 00:32:25,007
if I opened the good box first,

437
00:32:27,608 --> 00:32:29,677
this kind of situation
would've never happened.

438
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:33,447
It would've hurt a little,

439
00:32:35,757 --> 00:32:37,217
but I would've been okay.

440
00:32:39,187 --> 00:32:42,697
Then you and Yu Na
wouldn't have gotten hurt because of me.

441
00:32:53,068 --> 00:32:54,568
It's all my fault.

442
00:32:57,808 --> 00:32:59,777
I ruined everything.

443
00:33:24,737 --> 00:33:25,767
Han Kang Hee.

444
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:32,447
Who cares if you ruin things?

445
00:33:33,447 --> 00:33:35,777
Then something else would happen
as a result of it.

446
00:33:36,947 --> 00:33:38,818
Just like how we met again like this.

447
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,487
But we're going our separate ways again.

448
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,128
Didn't I tell you?

449
00:33:50,457 --> 00:33:53,997
No matter what anyone says,
just trust in yourself.

450
00:33:54,568 --> 00:33:56,568
Then whether one person criticizes you...

451
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:59,038
or a thousand people criticize you,
you'll be fine.

452
00:34:02,378 --> 00:34:03,737
It's something only you can do.

453
00:34:04,808 --> 00:34:06,707

denied the accusations of bullying,

I had a bad feeling about her.

There are many more people around you
who like and adore you.

Don't ignore the hearts
of those who like you...

655
00:49:45,589 --> 00:49:49,489
because of the hurt
you got from those who don't.

Kang Hee.

657
00:49:53,399 --> 00:49:54,629
Cheer up.

658
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:58,699
From a fan who is always curious
about Han Kang Hee.

659
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:47,279
What was I afraid and scared of?

660
00:50:48,449 --> 00:50:52,620
After I received your fan letter,
I needed a lot of time...

661
00:50:52,819 --> 00:50:55,120
to be able to write back to you
like I am now.

662
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:01,799
It's from Kang Hee.

663
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,469
- "Han Kang Hee."
- "Han Kang Hee."

664

- "Han Sol Yi, Lee Si Hyun."
- Let me see that.

665

Give it here.

666
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,299
- But Mom...
- I'll read it for you.

- It's really her.

Today, we have a very special letter

It's...

672
00:51:19,549 --> 00:51:21,620
from across the ocean in America.

673
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,690
It's a letter from actress Han Kang Hee.

I will read it with you guys.

It's from Kang Hee.

I will remember it forever
and be thankful throughout my life.

Please send me another fan letter.

even if it takes some time.

It's time for News Invitation.

Today, we have a very special guest
with us on News Invitation.

696
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:36,759
It's Actress Han Kang Hee,
who has returned to Korea after a year.

697
00:52:36,759 --> 00:52:37,960
Welcome. It's good to see you.

698
00:52:38,529 --> 00:52:40,560
Hello, I'm Actress Han Kang Hee.

699
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,029
First of all, congratulations.

700
00:52:42,029 --> 00:52:44,399
Director Choi's "Head On" received...

701
00:52:44,399 --> 00:52:46,739
the Palme d'Or,
the highest honor at Cannes Film Festival.

702
00:52:46,739 --> 00:52:47,770
Yes.

703
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:50,009
As the lead actress,
you must be very happy.

704
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:52,710
Yes, I am so happy.

705
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:56,149
I still remember that moment
every now and then.

706
00:52:56,279 --> 00:52:58,180
However, some say...

707
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:00,620
that you were a likely candidate
for the Best Actress Award,

708
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:04,520
but you lost out on winning
due to the film winning the Palme d'Or.

709
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,390
Many people are disappointed
because of that.

710
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:08,660
How do you feel?
Are you disappointed as well?

711
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:10,430
Yes, I am a bit disappointed.

712
00:53:11,629 --> 00:53:12,730
I'm just kidding.

713
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,299
I'm not disappointed at all.

714
00:53:15,299 --> 00:53:19,669
I believe that the Palme d'Or includes
the hard work and effort...

715
00:53:19,669 --> 00:53:24,270
of all the actors and production crew.

716
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:28,540
I met this film while I was going through
some personal hardships,

717
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,649
so it means a lot more to me.

718
00:53:31,379 --> 00:53:34,149
- You spent a long time filming in the US.
- Yes.

719
00:53:34,149 --> 00:53:35,989
But while you were filming there,

720
00:53:35,989 --> 00:53:38,790
you sent your fans handwritten letters,

721
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:40,390
which was the talk of the town.

722
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:41,390
Right.

723
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:43,230
Was there a particular reason
why you decided to do so?

724
00:53:46,299 --> 00:53:48,359
Some of you may know,

725
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:52,569
but I used to have
a hard time reading fan letters.

726
00:53:53,569 --> 00:53:55,569
I am still overcoming it,

727
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:58,870
but while I was in the US,

728
00:53:59,379 --> 00:54:03,109
a fan recorded a fan letter
and sent it to me.

729
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:05,779
- What a great fan.
- Yes.

730
00:54:06,219 --> 00:54:10,520
For me, that person was
a fan who showed me...

731
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,960
that some hearts are unwavering
since a long time ago.

732
00:54:16,859 --> 00:54:19,500
He was always curious to know
if I was okay,

733
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:23,069
and he wanted to know the real me,

734
00:54:23,069 --> 00:54:26,040
not the Han Kang Hee
that others talked about.

735
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:28,500
I see, there was a backstory to this.

736
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,640
Yes.

737
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:34,379
As I listened to the numerous
recorded fan letters,

738
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:35,710
I realized...

739
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:38,779
how my fans felt as they cheered me on...

740
00:54:38,779 --> 00:54:40,350
over the years.

741
00:54:40,949 --> 00:54:43,049
After I learned about how they felt,

742
00:54:43,219 --> 00:54:47,390
I also wanted to send
my sincere feelings to them too.

743
00:54:47,489 --> 00:54:48,719
I see.

744
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,180

No, it's not like that.
It's probably just a weird angle.

751
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,799
I'm sure their lips weren't touching.

752
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:07,600
I don't think their lips were touching.

755
00:56:11,339 --> 00:56:14,540
Can't two friends
show this much affection?

756

758

There is a saying...

that if lovers walk along
the stone-wall road of Deoksugung,

760
00:56:26,919 --> 00:56:28,359
they will break up.

- Really?
- Yes.

762
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:31,890
Then we shouldn't walk here.

763
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,600
That's why we will be running.

Let's go.

765
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:42,140
When I was young,
I once wrote a fan letter to you.

766
00:56:43,069 --> 00:56:45,839
I wrote it and erased it over and over.

767
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:48,739
I filled it with the best words I knew...

768
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:51,410
and messages of encouragement,
with all my heart.

769
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,350
- Hey, look at this.
- Come and try some.

770
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:56,419
- Let's try it.
- Do you want some?

771
00:56:56,419 --> 00:56:57,819
- Hello.
- Hello.

772
00:56:57,819 --> 00:57:00,190
- The candy? Sir, we'll take one of these.
- Yes.

773
00:57:00,359 --> 00:57:02,190
One day, I saw an interview...

774
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:04,029
that you were being tormented
by malicious comments.

775
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:07,100
I wanted to run to you right away
and tell you.

"Why did you only read
the malicious comments?"

777

but I see a beautiful daughter.

What should we eat?

785
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:38,390
- Should we get tripe?
- Tripe? I'd like that.

786

- Wait. Chicken feet.
- Let's have both.

787

- Can you really eat both?
- Of course.

- Hello. We're such big fans.
- Hello.

789
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,069
Oh, of course. What's your name?

- It's A Ram.
- A Ram.

791
00:57:49,339 --> 00:57:50,569
In 1, 2, 3.

792
00:57:50,669 --> 00:57:53,310
- Could I ask you to take one of us too?
- Sure.

Did you want to run to me
and tell me that right away?

Of course.

797
00:58:10,359 --> 00:58:12,629
When I read that article where you said
you stayed up all night...

798
00:58:12,629 --> 00:58:15,859
reading the 1 malicious comment
out of 99 good ones,

799
00:58:16,399 --> 00:58:18,129
I wanted to tell you that, no matter what.

You are more precious than anyone...

When you just said that you loved me,

806
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,560
did your eyes go to the right or the left?

807
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:50,290
My eyes?

808
00:59:50,290 --> 00:59:51,790
When you said that you loved me,

809
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:53,629
did your eyes go to the left or the right?

810
00:59:53,899 --> 00:59:57,129
Who would look elsewhere
while saying I love you?

811
00:59:57,129 --> 00:59:58,430
Darn it, I missed it.

812
00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:00,069
Do it again. Start from the beginning.

813
01:00:01,299 --> 01:00:02,370
Forget it.

814
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:04,739
What? Hey, come on.

815
01:00:04,739 --> 01:00:07,140
Start over from this part.

816
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:08,879
The part where you said
I was worthy of nothing but love.

817
01:00:08,879 --> 01:00:10,350
Come on. While looking at me.

818
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,250
Come on, just once.

819
01:00:14,779 --> 01:00:16,080
I'll do it since you're cute.

820
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,149
Really?

821
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:19,890
Read from here while looking at me.

822
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:21,460
"You are more precious than anyone..."

823
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:23,190
Look at me properly.

824
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:25,089
Your eyes...
