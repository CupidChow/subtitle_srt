Are these jerks even watching the drama?

166

Sure, I'm rude.

Kill yourself, Han Kang Hee.

Thank you.

188
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:10,429
I scheduled the interview
so you'd promote the drama.

189
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:12,299
Why did you argue with the journalist?

190
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,139
What is it?

191
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:17,840
Do you regret it?

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,440
What's the matter?

193
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,779
Can't even look me in the eyes?

194

Gosh.

Please. Stop nagging, I just got here.

196
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:30,620
What's wrong with your eyes? Did you cry?

197
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,190
I had ramyeon before I went to bed.

198
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,860
I know you'd never eat it.

199
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,659
What's the matter? Why did you cry?

200
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,799
Did Mr. Son get on your nerves again
by bringing up your mother?

201
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,000
No.

202
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,970
He's such a bully.

203
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:48,909
He promised not to talk
about your personal life.

204
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:50,039
Gosh.

205
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,980
It's not because of Mr. Son.

206
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,879
He's like that every time.

207
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,210
Then why did you cry?

208
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,080
Did you read malicious comments again?

209
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,759
I told you not to read that stuff.

210
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:06,259
Why won't you listen to me?

211
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:08,029
You only do what I tell you not to do.

212
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:10,590
When someone tells you not to do it,
you want to do it more.

213
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:12,559
Really?

214
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,429

Do you want to read them?

If I say that, would that make you stop?

Well, let's see.

218

No.

219
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,379
I want to read them more.

I want to read them all out of spite.

221

I should rip that mouth off of you.

222
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,350
Seriously.

223
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,720
Don't you feel sorry for your fans?

They came all the way here to see you,
and you barely smiled.

I'm not an idol.

That's true.

You're too old for that.

you'd nag at them instead of smile.

Why would you give them advice
when their parents don't?

being a celebrity is such a selfish job.

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,029
What about the store?

327
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:54,059
My mom...

328
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,170
My mom came.

329
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,970
I think she came so that her son, who's
stuck in the hospital convenience store,

330
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,680
could take a break.

331
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,309
Why would you come here?

332
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,380
My mom doesn't know her son at all.

333
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,109
The only friend I can hang out with
at this hour is you.

334
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:16,950
Be good to your mother.
Don't end up with regrets like me.

335
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:19,660
Mother, were you well last night?

336
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,130
Daddy, my wish.

337
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:24,599
Okay.

338
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,799
A wish? What wish?

339
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:29,200
My wish...

340
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:40,079
"Hello, Kang Hee."

341
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,140
"I'm Bang Yu Na..."

342
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,950
A third grader
at Heesong Elementary School.

343
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,349
I'm a young fan of yours,
who loves everything about you,

344
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:50,089
including your looks, your voice,
and your acting.

345
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,789
She's so cute.

346
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:57,359
"I heard you were the same age as my dad."

347
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:01,059
"But how come
you look so much younger than him?"

348
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,369
Really? Did she really write that?

349
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,170
My gosh.

350
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:10,710
But still, compared to Han Kang Hee,
you look young.

351
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,440
My gosh, your daughter is so eccentric.

352
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,450
It's not like Han Kang Hee
is your neighbor.

353
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,779
Why would she expect a celebrity
to write back?

354
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:19,220
She could expect that. It's not that hard.

355
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,279
Look at you.

356
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:23,349
It's Han Kang Hee. Korea's top star.

357
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:25,460
Korea's top what? My gosh.

358
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,960
Hey, I wasn't going to say this,

359
00:21:33,329 --> 00:21:36,500
but Han Kang Hee and I
were classmates in high school.

360
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,740
So what if you were classmates
in high school?

361
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,769
Do you even know her number?

362
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,210
- No.
- My gosh.

363
00:21:51,349 --> 00:21:53,549
I told you two to stop hanging out!

364
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,789
- My gosh. Go.
- Yes, ma'am. I'm leaving!

365
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,589
Gosh, Kang Hee.

366
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:05,460
This week's shoots were exhausting. Right?

367
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,430
The drama's almost over,

368
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,269
so let's rally for a bit longer. Okay?

369
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,470
What about the writer?

370
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,039
Didn't you say they'd be here?

371
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:16,569
Writer Park wasn't feeling well.

372
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:17,940
Are you sure they're not just avoiding me?

373
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:22,650
Avoiding you?
Why would a writer avoid an actor?

374
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:25,619
Okay. Let's say cheers.

375
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:27,220
Cheers.

376
00:22:33,089 --> 00:22:36,029
Hey, let's be honest.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

377
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:37,990
Gosh. Do you know something?

378
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:39,460
Don't get me started.

379
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,630
Han Kang Hee's mom...

380
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,430
is notorious for selling out her daughter
to hit on men.

381
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,000
I bet she doesn't even know
who her dad is.

382
00:22:45,069 --> 00:22:46,069
That's true.

383
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,910
I heard that some reporter
was her biological dad yesterday.

384
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,039
My gosh. You got that wrong.

385
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,210
Really?

386
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,180
Isn't that incredible?

387
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,220
Who do you think she gets
that attitude from?

388
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,289
- My gosh.
- No way.

389
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:04,390
How shocking.

390
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:08,190
Do you know how hard it was
for me to feign ignorance?

391
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,799
Viewer ratings?

392
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:17,970
We'd never blame you.

393
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,240
It's not your fault.

394
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,369
No.

395
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:24,269
It's because of your mother.

396
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:28,380
You're in the middle of shooting a drama,

397
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,650
so how could she shoot
a video like that...

398
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,549
to give you public embarrassment?

399
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,789
Who'd like the drama...

400
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:38,960
if the actress is someone immoral?

401
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,990
What a shame.

402
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,900
Is it my fault that the drama flopped?

403
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:50,200
No.

404
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,740
I'm not blaming anyone right now.

405
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,369
People don't watch dramas
because of the cast these days.

406
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,980
They watch it if the script
and the direction are good.

407
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:01,079
The ratings are rock bottom,

408
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:03,809
so you were searching for a good excuse.

409
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,119
The gossip about me came right in time,
so you must be happy.

410
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,849
You should watch it.

411
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:10,619
It's not like we released the story
on you.

412
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,390
You act like you're on my side
in front of me,

413
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,529
but I know you talk badly behind my back.

414
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,400
I'm sick of you people.

415
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,339
You're making a big mistake!

416
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,940
What happened?

417
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,539
I brought my car.

418
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:31,910
I called for a driver, so don't worry.

419
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:35,349
They must be here. I'm hanging up.

420
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,490
Gosh.

421
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,099
It's my first time wearing them today.

422
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,380
Are you a hater too?

423
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:12,150
Fine.

424
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,279
I was waiting to take it out on someone,

425
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,619
so I'm going to teach you a lesson.

426
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:35,539
Right.

427
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,109
Of course,
it wouldn't come off that easily.

428
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,150
It might be a little uncomfortable,

429
00:25:47,019 --> 00:25:49,750
but if I keep on pressing down like this,

430
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:54,220
I'll get used to it one day.

431
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,160
- Hey, Kang Hee!
- Sir, calm down.

432
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,500
Let me go. I don't deserve this.

433
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,369
Did you just throw that at me?

434
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:07,440
Yes. I threw it.

435
00:26:07,869 --> 00:26:11,210
You threw rude words at me first.

436
00:26:13,109 --> 00:26:14,339
Kang Hee.

437
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:18,250
You must think you're something
since you got famous as a kid.

438
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:23,089
I bet you'll get into big trouble
sooner or later.

439
00:26:23,089 --> 00:26:26,490
People like you,
who look down on directors and writers,

440
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,859
deserve to get completely ruined.

441
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,430
Only then will you learn a lesson.

442
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,529
- Didn't you see how she treated me?
- That's enough.

443
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,299
Let go.

444
00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:36,569
Do you think directors are...

445
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,799
Hey! Let go!

446
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:41,440
Where do you think you're going?
I'm not done.

447
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,410
What's the matter? Are you embarrassed?

448
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,839
What a joke.

449
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:13,339
- You should let her go.
- Who is this punk?

450
00:27:14,869 --> 00:27:16,369
I said, let her go.

451
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:19,380
Fine, I will.

452
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,410
I've never seen him before.

453
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,109
Did you get a new manager?

454
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:34,789
I'm her hired driver.

455
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,789
Not her manager.

456
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:41,099
What?

457
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:58,750
So what if you were classmates
in high school?

458
00:27:58,819 --> 00:28:00,650
Do you even know her number?

459
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:08,359
How's your wrist?

460
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,329
It must hurt a lot.

461
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:17,329
It's probably going to bruise.

462
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:19,769
You should treat it when you get home.

463
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,019
By the way...

464
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,220
Yes?

465
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,950
Do you know me?

466
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:39,859
Of course.

467
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:42,559
Everyone knows you in Korea, Ms. Han.

468
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:52,640
You haven't changed.

469
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,769
You still act like you don't know me.

470
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,259
Hey.

471
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,730
Hey.

472
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,950
I'm a little embarrassed.

473
00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:46,289
"Ms. Han?"

474
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:48,190
Well,

475
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,230
I see you a lot on television,

476
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:53,759
but you might not recognize me.

477
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:55,430
I was just being careful.

478
00:29:56,069 --> 00:29:58,000
You still look the same.

479
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,039
You've gotten more beautiful.

480
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:01,700
Really?

481
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,710
You look better in person
than on television.

482
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:07,180
Did you watch me a lot?

483
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:10,079
- How do I look better?
- What?

484
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,619
Well, I just...

485
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,740
- Kang Hee.
- Jung Seok.

486
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:35,240
- Yes?

00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:12,260
Then what was that article about?

806
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:15,000
The fan letters that were thrown out...

807
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,199
I got it.
It was a letter from the devil.

808
00:53:18,199 --> 00:53:20,070
- What?
- For real?

809
00:53:20,139 --> 00:53:21,599
- I know.
- They can so be annoying.

810
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:22,639
I know, right?

811
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:23,769
Hey, what's all this about?

812
00:53:24,469 --> 00:53:25,510
Why are they...

813
00:53:26,739 --> 00:53:28,539
Why are these people
coming to see that letter?

814
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,849
Hey. Take a look at this.

815
00:53:33,849 --> 00:53:35,849
I have been a fan of Kang Hee's
for a long time.

816
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:38,420
I wrote fan letters to her many times.

817
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:40,989
And she wrote back to me each time.

818
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:44,289
The article said
she looked down on her fans,

819
00:53:44,289 --> 00:53:45,429
but she's not like that.

820
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:49,199
This is a letter that I got from Kang Hee.

821
00:53:49,329 --> 00:53:51,670
Anyone who wants to see for themselves...

822
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:55,139
can come to Sebit Children's Hospital
and ask for me, Bang Yu Na.

823
00:53:57,239 --> 00:54:00,110
But how do you know
Han Kang Hee wrote this herself?

824
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:01,840
Yu Na.

825
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:06,150
Aren't you making things up
to get the adults' attention?

826
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:07,320
I'm not!

827
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,090
- She's not!
- Mom!

828
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:11,119
She's not.

829
00:54:11,219 --> 00:54:13,190
My dad got this from Kang Hee...

830
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:15,889
Dad!

831
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:19,159
All right, please leave now.

832
00:54:19,159 --> 00:54:20,730
The kids need to rest now.
This is a hospital.

833
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:23,130
- You're a doctor. Why aren't you working?
- Okay, fine.

834
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:24,130
Yu Na, come here.

835
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:25,670
- I couldn't even see it.
- Me either.

836
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:30,570
Dad, why did you make them go away?

837
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:33,039
And why did you show
that letter to people?

838
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:35,039
I should clear Kang Hee's name.

839
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:37,150
So why would you do that for her?

840
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:42,880
That's because I'm grateful for her
writing back to me.

841
00:54:43,019 --> 00:54:45,719
Yu Na, why are you being like this
over a silly letter?

842
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,760
Do you think I granted your wish
so you could gloat to people?

843
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,630
Hey, don't be too hard on her.

844
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:53,559
If you ever call people over
and do this again,

845
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,260
you will be in really big trouble. Got it?

846
00:54:58,099 --> 00:54:59,269
Answer me.

847
00:55:11,849 --> 00:55:12,880
Bang Yu Na!

848
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:16,519

849

(Dear Mom,
From Yu Na who misses Mommy)

850
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:20,920
Did you write to your mom?

851
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:27,000
Mom can't write letters back to me!

852
00:55:46,179 --> 00:55:48,780
As you said, Mr. Son, Kang Hee...

853
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:52,150
keeps her fan letters in the office.

854
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:56,659
It's true,
but that's not throwing them away.

855
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,590
Our employee dropped them by mistake,

856
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:03,699
and I saw you taking them.

857
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:11,510
We can explain this if we want to.

858
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:12,809
Then do that.

859
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:16,179
Even if you do, it will only reveal
that Han Kang Hee didn't read...

860
00:56:16,179 --> 00:56:18,079
her fan letters up to now.

861
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:20,320
So...

862

you're saying you can't write
a correction article, right?

863
00:56:24,619 --> 00:56:26,449
I'm saying I won't.

864
00:56:30,659 --> 00:56:31,730
Ms. Yoon.

865
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:34,630
I think you should see this.

866

Darn it.

871
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,000
Here is the next news.

872
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,400
Actress Han Kang Hee,
who is receiving criticism...

873
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,699
about the rumor that she threw out
her fan letters,

874
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:18,539
has been writing to a young fan
battling leukemia...

875
00:57:18,539 --> 00:57:21,380
for a long time.
This discovery has been...

876
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:23,340
changing people's opinions.

877
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:26,920
The child who said
she wrote to Han Kang Hee...

878
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:30,119
revealed the letters she received
so far...

879
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:31,519
on her social media.

You will only lose your own hair.

885
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:55,710
Gosh, these are so good.
Where did you get them?

886
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:58,280

Thank you.

890
00:58:03,949 --> 00:58:06,719
To be frank,
nobody lost money by doing this.

891
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:08,659
Think about it.

892
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,659
It's good for you
since you granted Yu Na's wish.

893
00:58:10,659 --> 00:58:12,960
And it's good for Yu Na
since Han Kang Hee wrote back to her.

894
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:15,960
Han Kang Hee was nearly ruined
because of fan letters,

895
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:19,170
but now, she's the person who gave
a sick girl her dreams and hopes.

896
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,570
She's an angel.

897
00:58:20,699 --> 00:58:22,840
She nearly lost her title
of being a deity.

898
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:26,369
But it's like she returned to her temple.

899
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:32,309
But I guess, if you think about it,
that could be true.

900
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:33,510
Nobody took a loss.

901
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:34,719
That's right.

902
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:37,389
Now that things have gotten this far,
Han Kang Hee can't reveal this either.

903
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,760
Reveal the truth right away.
It wasn't me.

904
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:44,159
It wasn't? Then who was that kid?

905
00:58:44,289 --> 00:58:46,230
They must've been determined
to get more views.

906
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:48,400
Gosh, I doubt it. They were kids.

907
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,929
Hey, kids are even worse these days.

908
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:52,929
I read this in an article somewhere.

909
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:54,869
Four-year-olds lie once every two hours,

910
00:58:54,869 --> 00:58:57,739
and 6-year-olds lie once every 90 minutes.

911
00:58:57,739 --> 00:58:59,269
If you leave your child like that
because they're cute,

912
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:01,510
the child will become an even worse liar.

913
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:04,849
Do you think you have the luxury
to worry about kids right now?

914
00:59:05,309 --> 00:59:07,780
Thanks to her, your image was restored.

915
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:10,889
But if you reveal it now, people will say,
"I knew Han Kang Hee was like that."

916
00:59:12,619 --> 00:59:13,920
"I knew Han Kang Hee was like that?"

917
00:59:14,619 --> 00:59:15,690
What's that supposed to mean?

918
00:59:16,659 --> 00:59:20,130
To be honest,
it's true you didn't read the fan letters.

919
00:59:22,329 --> 00:59:24,929
Did you ever greet your fans
in a friendly way,

920
00:59:24,929 --> 00:59:26,730
or did you speak to them kindly?

921
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:29,840
What you're doing now is using your fans.

922
00:59:31,809 --> 00:59:32,869
What? Use them?

923
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:36,840

and stabs you in the back?

926
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:49,860
Do you want to see Ms. Yoon blow a gasket?

927
00:59:50,059 --> 00:59:52,389
And do you think I'm not angry as well?

928
00:59:52,389 --> 00:59:54,429
What will you do by going to see that kid?

I should go and talk to her parents
to get our stories straight.

932

She even revealed the hospital's name
so anyone could come to see her.
