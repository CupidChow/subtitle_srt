1
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:32,770
(Episode 3)

2
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,520
Pass!

3
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,659
- Hey!
- Hey!

4
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:02,500
Nice!

5
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,640
Let's go!

6
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,180
Gosh, you look so cute.

7
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,819
"I want to surpass Song Hye Kyo
as a melodrama queen."

8
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:22,849
"Child actress
Han Kang Hee's strong ambition."

9
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:23,859
No way.

10
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:27,629
"Isn't Han Kang Hee the poster child
for a child actress who grew up well?"

11
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:31,030
"I wanted to become an actress
after seeing Song Hye Kyo."

12
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,230
Gosh.

13
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:34,000
Did you really say that?

14
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:36,129
What if people start
leaving malicious comments online?

15
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,939
Malicious comments aren't
important right now.

16
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:39,969
She's being linked to Song Hye Kyo!

17
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,310
You're right.

18
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,409
Hey, Kang Hee.

19
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:47,510
What if you end up having fan clubs
all over the country?

20
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,250
Oh, my gosh! That's so cool!

21
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,450
- Hey!
- You star.

22
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,480
Stop it.

23
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:54,189
Why are you guys making such a fuss
over a simple article?

24
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,950
Hey.

25
00:01:56,989 --> 00:01:59,489
I already have a fan club.

26
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,030
No way. Really?

27
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,959
That's incredible.
You really have a fan club?

28
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,359
- Are you serious?
- Really?

29
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,240
Hey, Kang Hee.

30
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:15,740
Yes?

31
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:19,340
I saw someone put a letter and gift
in your locker earlier.

32
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:20,949
A letter?

33
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:24,919
Is Actress Han
finally getting showered with fan letters?

34
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:27,050
I'm so jealous.

35
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:28,620
Why would they do that at school?

36
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:30,960
I wonder who it is.

37
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:57,650
(Bang Jung Seok)

38
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,759
- Hey, what's the matter?
- What's wrong?

39
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,270
What is that?

40
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,800
(Han Kang Hee, I will kill you.)

41
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,979
(Han Kang Hee, I will kill you.)

42
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,769
Kang Hee, are you okay?

43
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:52,459
I only realized later...

44
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,569
that you were trying to help me.

45
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,040
Did I do that?

46
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,139
I can't remember...

47
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:11,019
Do you know what's funny?

48
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:13,750
I can't read fan letters,

49
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:15,850
but I'm addicted to looking up comments.

50
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:17,360
Comments?

51
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,089
- Like malicious comments?
- Yes.

52
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:24,629
Why would you look them up?

53
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:29,529
You know,

54
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,769
people can fake it as if they like you,

55
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:33,769
but they can never fake hatred.

56
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,779
At least those people
won't be hiding anything.

57
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,980
I'm curious.

58
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,519
About what?

59
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,589
About what you think of me.

60
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,269
I was talking about people
who leave malicious comments.

61
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:04,540
I never asked you
to be curious about what I thought.

62
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,800
I know.

63
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,970
But I'm curious.

64
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:11,980
I'm curious about what you think of me,

65
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:15,410
and if you're really okay
after all you've been through.

66
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,279
Your thoughts,

67
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,120
your feelings, your emotions...

68
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,649
I'm curious about all of them.

69
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:28,259
Why...

70
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:33,060
are you curious about that?

71
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:35,199
Because that's who you are.

72
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,000
Because that's the real you.

73
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,370
Not the Kang Hee people gossip about...

74
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,740
or write about on the Internet.

75
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:48,279
You're the one who knows the best
about the real Han Kang Hee.

76
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,050
It'll be okay
as long as you believe in yourself.

77
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:54,720
It won't matter
how many people talk badly about you.

78
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,089
Nothing will be able to hurt you.

79
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,629
Kang Hee!

80
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,060
Kang Hee.

81
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:35,189
Hey.

82
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:36,560
I'll wait in the car.

83
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:38,360
Okay.

84
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:44,139
By the way,

85
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:48,810
what did you do with the second box
that was in your locker?

86
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,170
What box?

87
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,410
That?

88
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:55,379
I never opened it.

89
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,009
You didn't?

90
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,220
No.

91
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,050
Who knows what could be in it?

92
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,389
That's true, but...

93
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:13,730
Give that to me.

94
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,009
I'll give it a shot,

95
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,240
although I'm not so confident.

96
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:29,610
People suspect that the story
about the sick girl was made up.

97
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,779
Do you have anything to say?

98
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:34,419
Actress Han Kang Hee is suspected
of making up a moving story,

99
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:37,090
while her alumnus and his family
were seen walking out of her home.

100
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,190
- The media flocked...
- Please don't shoot.

101
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,159
- You can't shoot this. Wait.
- to capture the scene.

102
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,899
If you knew about their relationship,

103
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:50,940
why didn't you tell me?

104
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,639
I'm sorry.

105
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,740
Gosh.

106
00:08:57,539 --> 00:08:58,710
But...

107
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,950
you told me this
when I first started work.

108
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,879
You said managers needed to learn
how to keep secrets.

109
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:06,149
You said you'd let it go once
even if I held a secret with her...

110
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:07,850
without telling you.

111
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,759
If I let you have another secret,
I'll have to keep my eyes shut.

112
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,789
But...

113
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,190
don't you find the story so moving?

114
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,470
He did it to grant the wish
of his sick daughter.

115
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,269
You know, if my daughter told me
she likes Scarlett Johansson,

116
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:26,600
I'd learn English
just to be able to write a reply.

117
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,870
Can't you see the situation we're in?

118
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,879
You were moved,

119
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,639
but in the eyes of the public,
it looks like a show.

120
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,210
They'll feel deceived!

121
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,950
But Kang Hee worked so hard
to make the girl's dream come true!

122
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:38,980
Hey!

123
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,090
Get out.

124
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,250
Get out.

125
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,690
- I said, go!
- I'm leaving.

126
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,159
Take all your stuff.

127
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:54,899
Do you want to pick a drink?

128
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,200
Hey, that's him.

129
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,769
He took advantage of his daughter
to make money.

130
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,470
You're right. I hope he doesn't ruin
our hospital's image.

131
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,179
How inhumane.

132
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,110
That's the guy.

133
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,179
He looks like a nice guy,
but he's really terrible.

134
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:14,190
- That's what I mean.
- It comes to five dollars.

135
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:16,990
Why would a young guy do that?

136
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,019
- I feel sorry for the kid.
- Don't you want one, Dad?

137
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,059
I'm okay. Are you done?

138
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,590
Thank you.

139
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,080
Let's go.

140
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,049
- Yoon Do.
- Yes?

141
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,919
Can you ring this up too?

142
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,419
Sure.

143
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,500
Dad.

144
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,600
Yes?

145
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,600
It's really exhausting to be famous.

146
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,169
You're right.

147
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,399
It's exhausting.

148
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,570
It must have been so hard on her.

149
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:09,139
Right.

150
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:11,279
What?

151
00:11:11,909 --> 00:11:13,080
Who?

152
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,980
Kang Hee, of course.

153
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:20,889
It must be like this all the time for her.

154
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,120
People will stare wherever she goes,

155
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,759
take pictures of her, and point at her.

156
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:29,230
I think I kind of knew...

157
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,600
that you wrote the reply.

158
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,269
What?

159
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,440
Since when?

160
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:42,309
Thank you.

161
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,679
- Should I autograph this?
- Yes.

162
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,679
Okay.

163
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,509
- What's your name?
- Si Hyun.

164
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:50,779
Si Hyun?

What is this?

196
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,360
The reason I'm posting this video...

197
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,559
is because I felt
that I should reveal the truth...

behind the reply my daughter
received for the fan letter she sent.

as well as actress Han Kang Hee,
went through.

As I mentioned earlier,

202
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:11,549
all of this started
because of a lie I told,

203
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,250
and it was all my fault.

204

So I implore all of you to please
stop directing all your criticisms...

I would like to express
my sincerest gratitude...

to Han Kang Hee for not refusing a favor
asked by a classmate she met by chance...

do you want to go there?

I didn't know such a quiet place existed

How did you think of this?

I just read your mind.

What did my mind say?

00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:00,849
"I came all the way here,
so it'd be a pity to just leave."

"I want to hang out,"

but I saw some malicious ones too.

325
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,140
Kang Hee.

326
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,950
Just ignore the bad ones.

327
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,220
You need to become stronger.
You have to control your mind.

328
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,589
Who is this attention seeker?

329
00:24:08,589 --> 00:24:10,250
I hear he's a lawyer.
Is this how he does business?

330
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,319
I don't know... His face ticks me off.

331
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:14,589
Get away from Ms. Han Kang Hee.

332
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,890
What is this?

333
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:17,759
"Get away from Ms. Han Kang Hee?"

334
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,460
I can let the other ones go.

335
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,930
But he addresses you so politely
while telling me to go away.

336
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,539
He must know we're the same age,
so why is he so rude to me?

337
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:28,940
He's doing that on purpose.

338
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,440
Look. There are only two comments
since no one agrees with him.

339
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,880
"Flanders?"

340
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:35,880
I thought you told me to ignore them.

341
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,730
I guess I ended up reading some.

342
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,930
Here. I'll give it back when you go.

343
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:05,980
- It's on the first floor.
- Let's go.

344
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,680
We have to go down.

345
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,380
(Dad)

346
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:25,099
And you're the one
who told me to quit smoking.

347
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,069
By the way,
why are you carrying that bag around?

348
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,640
I have something to give to you.

349
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:39,509
What?

350
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,339
A nice box.

351
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:49,190
When a youth under 18 years of age
ends up smoking,

352
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,319
it can cause permanent damage
to their genes.

353
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:54,519
In that respect,
how is this instead of cigarettes?

354
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,890
They had a buy one get one free sale
at the store, so I got this for you.

355
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,359
Let me warn you just in case.

356
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:00,930
This isn't a confession.

357
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,569
Why are you just standing there? Take it.

358
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:03,569
It's yours.

359
00:26:03,569 --> 00:26:10,470
<i>I wish I could buy you a nice necklace</i>

360
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:15,109
<i>I wish I could give you a ride</i>
<i>in a nice car</i>

361
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:19,019
I think this is how you play it.

362
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:21,480
But all I have are chocolates...

363
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,119
I read it in one of your interviews...

364
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,430
that you liked these.

365
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:32,799
Here, it's a gift.

366
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,339
I should just leave it in her locker.

367
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:45,579
- What's wrong?
- It's a letter.

368
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,779
Who wrote a letter with a dead bird?

369
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,009
Who did this?

370
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,809
- Is this real?
- Maybe it's...

371
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:51,950
Move out of the way.

372
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,000
Kang Hee, are you okay?

Instead of the nice box filled
with chocolates,

376
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:10,529
you opened the bad box first.

377
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:11,619
- Kang Hee.
- Yes?

378

Let's go out.

379

Come on.

380
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,309
- Hurry up.
- Come on.

381
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,109
It's not budging.

382
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,279
Hey.

383
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,319
Can't we just talk to the security guard
to let us out?

384
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,750
I'm Han Kang Hee.

385
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,019
Don't you know what would happen...

386
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:43,650
if people found out I was with a man
at this hour?

387
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,859
They'll say I was on a late-night date
with a man at my high school.

388
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:48,829
All right. I'll open it.

389
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:50,690
But it's really not budging.

390
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,900
Gosh.

391
00:29:52,329 --> 00:29:53,630
Here.

392

Do you think you can get down?

394
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:03,869
Of course.

- Hey.
- What?

396
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:08,109
Don't you dare peek under my dress.

397
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,309
Of course not.

398

Oh, my gosh.

How's Kang Hee's condition?

She's flying.

I'll try that again.

She said she might play
a boxer in the future.

I didn't get to tell her
that she wasn't getting any scripts.

Let's call it

Just send me a PDF.

We worked on this all night.

- It's true.

Is 3 enough? What's number 1?

Number one. Appear on a variety show!

Plus, it's obvious that I'm dolled up,

but I have to say things like,
"Oh, my. I'm not wearing any makeup."

Donate my talents?

Yes. You would record readings
of fairy tales...

for young patients who can't read.

Then does that mean
I have to go to the hospital?

Yes. They said
they had a recording studio there.

That sounds good.

I have a good voice,
and I'm a good actress.

It's perfect for a press release too.
And it's meaningful.

There's going to be a cameo today.

466

I heard she was a famous actress
who was close to the director.

I'm afraid she'll get discouraged.

- Did you see the script?
- Yes.

- What is this?
- That totally surprised me.

She's not glaring at her.

I posted this

but Han Kang Hee ignored her
and just walked by.
