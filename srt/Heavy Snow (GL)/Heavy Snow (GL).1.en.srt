[Seol]

3
00:00:55,599 --> 00:00:58,709
To be or not to be, that is the question.

4
00:01:01,889 --> 00:01:04,365
What did you do to anger the gods

5
00:01:04,366 --> 00:01:05,715
and get sent here?

6
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:15,767
Hey! Don’t shoot for real!

7
00:01:16,294 --> 00:01:17,536
Are you laughing?

8
00:01:17,684 --> 00:01:19,371
Lee Su An.

9
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:21,313
You think this is funny?

10
00:01:21,316 --> 00:01:22,609
Stop it.

11
00:01:26,004 --> 00:01:28,148
As friends, let’s be honest

12
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:29,656
and ask you again.

13
00:01:31,287 --> 00:01:34,499
You were summoned here, weren’t you?

14
00:01:35,215 --> 00:01:36,205
Look.

15
00:01:36,699 --> 00:01:40,328
This is how little you think of me.

16
00:02:00,104 --> 00:02:02,106
How did you come up with that?

17
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,692
I could never do that.

18
00:02:08,905 --> 00:02:10,782
Is school life tough?

19
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,785
Well... a little.

20
00:02:15,196 --> 00:02:17,663
I’ve only been here a month myself.

21
00:02:17,987 --> 00:02:19,806
I guess they don’t welcome

22
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,416
transfer students here.

23
00:02:32,505 --> 00:02:35,216
It feels unreal seeing you like this.

24
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:37,391
What?

25
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,409
I really liked the drama you were in…

26
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:46,194
Which one?

27
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:53,114
Teenage Love Counseling…

28
00:02:53,497 --> 00:02:55,200
and School of Hip Hop.

29
00:02:56,494 --> 00:02:58,496
I was the lead in both of those.

30
00:02:59,894 --> 00:03:01,332
Are you a fan of mine?

31
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:09,007
But I don't really watch dramas these days.

32
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,941
You’re being too serious.

33
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,867
Almost there.

34
00:03:19,006 --> 00:03:20,183
Almost there.

35
00:03:25,197 --> 00:03:26,148
This is it.

36
00:03:37,493 --> 00:03:39,077
Is this your mom’s car?

37
00:03:40,198 --> 00:03:41,121
Yeah.

38
00:03:42,217 --> 00:03:43,112
Let’s go.

39
00:03:43,113 --> 00:03:47,205
Wait. I don’t have a license.

40
00:03:47,503 --> 00:03:48,718
What’s the big deal?

41
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,255
You just need to know how to drive.

42
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,007
I don’t care if something happens,

43
00:03:54,008 --> 00:03:56,592
but you’re a celebrity.

44
00:03:56,593 --> 00:03:58,263
I don’t care.

45
00:04:17,784 --> 00:04:19,784
By the way, where do you live?

46
00:04:20,497 --> 00:04:21,702
The ocean.

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,221
Let’s go to the sea.

48
00:04:43,976 --> 00:04:45,103
Sorry…

49
00:05:12,002 --> 00:05:13,837
Do you think we can go in?

50
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:16,699
Yes.

51
00:05:20,601 --> 00:05:22,347
… It’s beautiful.

52
00:05:40,783 --> 00:05:44,077
Can we surf here?

53
00:05:45,705 --> 00:05:47,747
Since the military left,

54
00:05:47,902 --> 00:05:50,125
surfers have been coming here.

55
00:06:18,401 --> 00:06:19,654
What are you filming?

56
00:06:21,504 --> 00:06:22,782
Just random things.

57
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,327
But you’re an acting major.

58
00:06:27,406 --> 00:06:28,538
Yeah.

59
00:06:28,915 --> 00:06:30,041
Then why?

60
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,925
I’ve never been in any movies…

61
00:06:42,597 --> 00:06:44,053
Not even in a school project.

62
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,488
Really?

63
00:06:45,712 --> 00:06:46,669
Why not?

64
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,976
No one ever asked me,

65
00:06:53,404 --> 00:06:54,233
and honestly,

66
00:06:54,234 --> 00:06:56,211
I’m not as good-looking as you.

67
00:06:56,212 --> 00:06:58,913
So I’m unlikely to be a real actor.

68
00:07:10,206 --> 00:07:11,706
You have your own charm.

69
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:21,000
That’s why I’ll make my own movie one day.

70
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:23,134
What kind of movie?

71
00:07:25,388 --> 00:07:27,413
A story I want to tell,

72
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:29,018
with characters I create

73
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:30,407
and I’ll be the lead.

74
00:07:31,768 --> 00:07:34,646
Director!

75
00:07:35,796 --> 00:07:38,149
Alright then, film me!

76
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:44,031
Come on, give me a task or something.

77
00:07:44,318 --> 00:07:45,485
A task?

78
00:07:55,585 --> 00:07:56,960
Act with this.

Hey,

80
00:07:58,877 --> 00:08:01,006
what am I supposed to do with this?

81
00:08:02,793 --> 00:08:04,301
Hi…

82
00:08:07,093 --> 00:08:09,555
How did you end up here?

83
00:08:13,102 --> 00:08:14,604
It’s hard, right?

84
00:08:22,006 --> 00:08:23,862
You must be cold?

85
00:08:27,012 --> 00:08:28,700
I’m cold, too.

86
00:08:29,296 --> 00:08:30,702
Are you okay?

87
00:08:44,407 --> 00:08:45,717
Do you hear something?

88
00:08:56,812 --> 00:08:58,424
Yeah, I hear it…

89

90
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:11,910
What’s wrong?

91
00:09:20,211 --> 00:09:24,506
I don’t know why I feel so sad…

92
00:09:39,105 --> 00:09:40,647
Why aren’t you filming?

93
00:09:43,301 --> 00:09:44,943

00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,934
Why did you transfer to this rural school?

97
00:11:01,987 --> 00:11:03,604
I wanted to take a break from showbiz.

98
00:11:07,902 --> 00:11:09,694
Actually, I came here for some peace.

99
00:11:10,988 --> 00:11:12,405
What’s wrong?

100
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,493
I realized I’ve had some issues.

101
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:21,247
It’s complicated.

102
00:11:26,297 --> 00:11:28,713
Did showbiz hurt you?

103
00:11:30,184 --> 00:11:32,967
I’ve been acting since I was 10.

104
00:11:35,092 --> 00:11:36,596
So…

105
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:40,892
I just worried about how people saw me,

106
00:11:41,393 --> 00:11:43,977
and the characters I played on TV…

107
00:11:45,896 --> 00:11:48,525
I had no idea who I really was.

108
00:12:00,591 --> 00:12:02,455
That’s why I envy you.

You can act as you want.

You can do that, too.

112
00:12:18,782 --> 00:12:22,601
I don’t even know what I want to do.

113
00:12:24,397 --> 00:12:26,399
And even if I did,

114
00:12:28,504 --> 00:12:30,923
who would let me?

115
00:12:32,091 --> 00:12:34,362
All they notice is how I look…

116
00:12:40,096 --> 00:12:42,256
I wish I could look like you,

117
00:12:42,256 --> 00:12:43,746
even just for a day…

118
00:12:47,107 --> 00:12:48,417
Right…

00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:51,963

Where are we going?

00:14:17,894 --> 00:14:20,132
You don’t sleep well either?

126
00:14:24,903 --> 00:14:25,946
Let’s go.

127
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,260
So, where are we going?

128
00:14:39,697 --> 00:14:41,198
How about Seoul?

129
00:14:44,295 --> 00:14:45,713
We can’t go there.

130
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:47,742
Why not?

131
00:14:49,191 --> 00:14:51,291
I can’t drive to Seoul.

132
00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:53,271
There are too many cars and

133
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:54,810
the roads are tricky.

134
00:14:55,191 --> 00:14:57,213
You can do it.

135
00:14:58,007 --> 00:15:00,341
There aren’t many cars at this time.

136
00:15:02,511 --> 00:15:04,887
But it’s a school night.

137
00:15:05,302 --> 00:15:06,597
Let’s play hooky.

138
00:15:07,391 --> 00:15:09,310
I’ll make it really fun.

139

Please.

140
00:15:10,894 --> 00:15:13,604
Are you serious?

141
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:18,034

Where should we go?

144
00:15:49,805 --> 00:15:52,018
Do you have anywhere in mind?

145
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,774
Myeong-dong?

146
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:00,776
Myeong-dong?

147
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:03,509
Hey,

no one goes there anymore.

Why’d you even ask me then?

Alright, alright!

Stay in your lane!

Stop it!

Why, we’re risking our lives.

00:22:59,898 --> 00:23:01,525
It’s just a scene.

195
00:23:23,294 --> 00:23:25,294
In the early Middle Ages,
[Seol, why aren’t you coming to school?]

196
00:23:25,295 --> 00:23:28,028
the church held all the power
[Give me a call.]

197
00:23:28,029 --> 00:23:29,803
and banned theater.

198
00:23:30,003 --> 00:23:32,814
It wasn’t until the 10th to 15th centuries

199
00:23:32,815 --> 00:23:34,671
that religious plays became popular

200
00:23:34,672 --> 00:23:36,527
as a means of spreading the faith.

201
00:23:37,703 --> 00:23:39,710
So what happened with you and Ji Min?

202
00:23:39,915 --> 00:23:40,986
I screwed up.

203
00:23:40,987 --> 00:23:44,590
Do you know anyone you can set me up with?

204
00:23:44,592 --> 00:23:45,799
Stop saying dumb stuff.

205
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,201
You need to try harder.

206
00:23:47,202 --> 00:23:48,328
Right!

207
00:23:48,611 --> 00:23:49,933
Did you hear about the rumor

208
00:23:49,934 --> 00:23:51,113
with Seol dating someone?

209
00:23:51,114 --> 00:23:52,907
Again? Another one?

210
00:23:53,085 --> 00:23:54,441
You know, she was known as

211
00:23:54,442 --> 00:23:55,796
a slut at her last school.

212
00:23:56,086 --> 00:23:57,309
So who is it this time?

213
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:58,835
You know her co-star

214
00:23:58,836 --> 00:24:00,718
in that drama, Min-hyung?

215
00:24:01,172 --> 00:24:03,898
I’m pretty sure he fucked her a lot.

216
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,917
I’m so jealous.

217
00:24:04,917 --> 00:24:08,681
Then become an idol like him, you dumbass!

218
00:24:13,311 --> 00:24:14,770
What the hell?

219
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,223
You should be mad at

220
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:19,617
your lesbian lover, not us.

221
00:24:19,618 --> 00:24:21,619
Watch your mouth, you bastard!

222
00:24:22,998 --> 00:24:24,363
What did you just say?

223
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,633
Hey! Knock it off, already!

224
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:31,221
Wake up.

225
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,914
She’s from a different world.

226
00:24:35,794 --> 00:24:37,200
Wake up!

227
00:24:37,201 --> 00:24:38,836
I said stop it!

228
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:46,009
What a noble mind is here o’erthrown!

229
00:24:48,205 --> 00:24:52,474
What a noble mind is here o’erthrown!

230
00:24:55,504 --> 00:24:58,022
The courtier’s, soldier’s, scholar’s,

231
00:24:58,023 --> 00:24:59,315
eye, tongue, sword…

232
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,205
Let’s make a romance movie together.

233
00:25:17,595 --> 00:25:20,718
We’ll sit together by the empty sea,

234
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,713
listening to the waves,

235
00:25:29,202 --> 00:25:30,498
and when it snows,

236
00:25:30,499 --> 00:25:32,512
we’ll run around like crazy.

237
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,018
Come on… Who’s even going to see it?

238
00:25:46,396 --> 00:25:48,948
Let’s make a romance movie together.

239
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:58,290
And then…

240
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:05,244
We’ll keep it just between us,

241
00:26:05,246 --> 00:26:07,215
never showing it to anyone.

242
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,634
Can I help you?

243
00:26:52,886 --> 00:26:54,722
How much is this coat?

244
00:26:54,723 --> 00:26:58,191
It’s 20% off for Christmas.

245
00:26:58,192 --> 00:26:59,476
That’ll be 170,000 won.

246
00:28:20,504 --> 00:28:21,782
Lee Yoon Seol!

247
00:28:29,311 --> 00:28:30,651
Su An.

248
00:28:36,694 --> 00:28:39,284
I tried to call you…

249
00:28:44,894 --> 00:28:49,794
I’ve been busy with drama filming.

250
00:28:53,383 --> 00:28:55,717
You could’ve told me…

251
00:28:56,106 --> 00:28:57,677
I was worried.

252
00:29:19,796 --> 00:29:21,201
Do you want to go out?

253
00:29:24,205 --> 00:29:25,956
It’s nice to be out!

254
00:29:28,877 --> 00:29:31,378
Why aren’t you wearing a mask?

255
00:29:32,408 --> 00:29:34,510
What if people recognize you?

256
00:29:34,511 --> 00:29:35,691
Who cares?

257
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,359
It’s okay.

258
00:29:39,095 --> 00:29:40,153
Hey!

259
00:29:40,878 --> 00:29:43,140
Bring this to school tomorrow!

260
00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:45,561
Excuse me, I’m a huge fan,

261
00:29:45,562 --> 00:29:47,102
could I take a picture with you?

262
00:29:47,103 --> 00:29:48,207
Just one, please!

263
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:49,162
Okay…

264
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,506
You’re so beautiful!

265
00:29:51,507 --> 00:29:53,442
Okay, one, two, three!

266
00:29:54,193 --> 00:29:56,904
Thank you!

267
00:29:59,899 --> 00:30:02,243
See? Everyone recognizes you.

268
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:03,301
Well.

269
00:30:03,611 --> 00:30:05,696
Then maybe we should walk closer.

270
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:13,963
This looks good on you.

271
00:30:14,806 --> 00:30:16,549
You should buy it.

272
00:30:19,706 --> 00:30:21,734
Hello! I’m a huge fan.

273
00:30:21,735 --> 00:30:24,223
Could I get your autograph?

274
00:30:28,402 --> 00:30:29,815
Thank you so much! I’m a huge fan.

275
00:30:29,816 --> 00:30:33,440
I’m sorry, we need to get going.

276
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:36,985
Let’s go get something delicious.

277
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:40,822
As you wish.

278
00:30:47,592 --> 00:30:49,424
This is so good!

279
00:30:51,596 --> 00:30:53,014
You should try it!

280
00:30:55,505 --> 00:30:57,464
Let’s finish it and go home.

281
00:31:00,009 --> 00:31:01,091
No.

282
00:31:02,704 --> 00:31:04,972
I want to stay with you.

283
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,393
What’s with you today?

284
00:31:10,603 --> 00:31:12,271
Did you watch the drama I’m in?

285
00:31:13,273 --> 00:31:14,314
No…

286
00:31:17,318 --> 00:31:18,485
Don’t.

287
00:31:19,508 --> 00:31:20,570
It’s not good.

288
00:31:35,189 --> 00:31:36,510
I think I’m being punished

289
00:31:38,693 --> 00:31:40,214
for breaking our promise.

290
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:46,680
It’s tough.

291
00:31:53,383 --> 00:31:55,105
A promise about our film?

292
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:59,443
Why did you take the role, then?

293
00:32:01,988 --> 00:32:03,280
I don’t know.

294
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,617
I’m so scared.

295
00:32:10,788 --> 00:32:12,926
Just thinking that people might forget

296
00:32:12,927 --> 00:32:14,332
about me drives me crazy.

297
00:32:16,711 --> 00:32:18,121
I can’t sleep at night.

298
00:32:18,122 --> 00:32:20,756
All I do is search my name on the internet.

299
00:32:24,218 --> 00:32:25,635
I’m so pathetic, right?

300
00:32:29,294 --> 00:32:31,558
I thought you hate that kind of thing…

301
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:35,730
I know.

302
00:32:38,316 --> 00:32:40,859
I know it’s all meaningless.

303
00:32:45,406 --> 00:32:47,240
So what matters to you

304
00:32:48,705 --> 00:32:50,999
isn’t me, but those fans over there.

305
00:32:52,112 --> 00:32:54,498
Why did you even bring me here?

306
00:32:54,499 --> 00:32:56,041
To feel superior?

307
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:04,007
You know that’s not true.

308
00:33:08,917 --> 00:33:10,430
Stop lying.

309
00:33:12,308 --> 00:33:13,558
Lying?

310
00:33:15,895 --> 00:33:18,230
You’re the one who lied to me.

311
00:33:20,311 --> 00:33:21,604
When did I?

312
00:33:22,192 --> 00:33:24,069
Anyone can see this is a romance,

313
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:26,447
Why’d you pretend it wasn’t?

314
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:38,667
You deceived me.

315
00:33:57,103 --> 00:33:58,103
Su An!

316
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,105
Come here.

317
00:34:12,005 --> 00:34:13,911
Did you hear that Seol transferred?

318
00:34:17,084 --> 00:34:17,914
Sorry?

319
00:34:18,498 --> 00:34:20,626
You didn’t know?

320
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,250
I see…

321
00:34:25,293 --> 00:34:27,883
Since you two were close,

322
00:34:28,301 --> 00:34:31,803
I was wondering if something happened.

323
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:38,401
Alright,

324
00:34:38,597 --> 00:34:39,935
never mind.

325
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:55,602
[Lee Yoon Seol]

326
00:35:33,783 --> 00:35:35,604
Hello sir.

327
00:35:35,605 --> 00:35:37,607
<i>Hi, do you have a moment?</i>

328
00:35:38,204 --> 00:35:40,104
Yes, of course.

329
00:35:40,105 --> 00:35:42,599
<i>Someone left a surfboard at school</i>

330
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,000
<i>under your name.</i>

[Su An]

332
00:36:56,449 --> 00:36:59,451
<i>Okay, we’re ready! Rolling!</i>

333
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,021
- Sound,
- Yeah.

334
00:37:12,388 --> 00:37:14,899
- camera.
- Yeah.

335
00:37:17,497 --> 00:37:18,511
<i>Action!</i>

336
00:37:19,592 --> 00:37:21,098
We need to talk, Jung Hyeon.

337
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,237
I…

338
00:37:36,906 --> 00:37:39,532
Don’t want to stand in your way…

339
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:43,786
I want to hold on to our memories…

340
00:37:43,788 --> 00:37:45,414
I can give it all up.

341
00:37:45,706 --> 00:37:47,415
I can let everything go.

342
00:37:48,793 --> 00:37:51,210
Do you really not know
who I want to protect?

343
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,879
But it’s hurting you.

344
00:38:05,705 --> 00:38:07,018
Cut! Okay!

345
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,813
Alright, that’s a wrap!

346
00:38:09,404 --> 00:38:11,940
Thank you, everyone.

347
00:38:25,913 --> 00:38:27,335
[She was so good in that drama.]

348
00:38:27,335 --> 00:38:29,290
[She's so pretty
and her acting is so good.]

349
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:31,314
[Details in her acting were so good.]

350
00:38:31,315 --> 00:38:33,335
[I hope to see her in more dramas!]

351
00:38:33,409 --> 00:38:34,545
Su An.

352
00:38:35,205 --> 00:38:37,489
I had drinks with PD PARK last night,

353
00:38:37,491 --> 00:38:39,217
and he said he was impressed
with your acting.

354
00:38:39,989 --> 00:38:41,344
Really?

355
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:44,100
Yeah, he was asking about your schedule

356
00:38:44,101 --> 00:38:45,031
for his next drama.

357
00:38:45,598 --> 00:38:46,911
What’s the role?

358
00:38:47,005 --> 00:38:48,507
He’ll send an email,

359
00:38:49,195 --> 00:38:50,677
but I’m sure it’ll be at least

360
00:38:50,678 --> 00:38:51,813
a lead supporting role.

361
00:38:53,491 --> 00:38:55,201
That sounds good.

362
00:39:05,582 --> 00:39:07,120
You know,

363
00:39:07,402 --> 00:39:10,414
this is my first time meeting
someone like this.

364
00:39:10,791 --> 00:39:13,197
So you’ve only met people through the app?

365
00:39:13,198 --> 00:39:14,198
Yeah.

366
00:39:15,504 --> 00:39:18,006
I guess you can’t use the app

367
00:39:18,495 --> 00:39:20,008
because you’re an actor…

368
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:25,693
How do you date, then?

369
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,809
I don’t date…

370
00:39:41,489 --> 00:39:43,406
Can we see each other again?

371
00:40:00,286 --> 00:40:02,675
Sorry, I’m not looking for a relationship…

372
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,622
With me?

373
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:12,518
No, it’s not you, it’s me.

374
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:21,110
I just don’t want to date anyone.

375
00:40:30,087 --> 00:40:31,204
I see.

376
00:40:40,797 --> 00:40:42,422
Just stay here with me.

377
00:40:54,206 --> 00:40:58,210
I’m really tired of
meeting people like this.

378
00:40:59,399 --> 00:41:01,275
Not anymore.

379
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:14,914
The sensitivity and awareness

380
00:41:15,915 --> 00:41:17,708
around political correctness!

381
00:41:18,692 --> 00:41:20,703
How important is that?

382
00:41:20,704 --> 00:41:21,588
You’re absolutely right, sir.

383
00:41:22,172 --> 00:41:24,774
How certain language can be violent…

384
00:41:24,901 --> 00:41:29,906
How certain attitudes can be
hatred to others,

385
00:41:30,097 --> 00:41:33,516
This is fairy new movement.

386
00:41:33,712 --> 00:41:35,803
It’s only been few years.

387
00:41:35,804 --> 00:41:37,604
Yes, you’re right, sir.

388
00:41:40,399 --> 00:41:41,399
So…

389
00:41:43,495 --> 00:41:46,233
There are so many of those so-called

390
00:41:46,234 --> 00:41:49,427
‘progressive’ assholes patronizing others.

391
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,591
I totally agree, sir.

392
00:41:51,703 --> 00:41:53,078
You’re absolutely right, sir.

393
00:41:53,581 --> 00:41:56,664
Of course I’m right. I’m not wrong.

394
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,592
Are you okay?

395
00:42:09,011 --> 00:42:10,678
I’m fine…

396
00:42:13,892 --> 00:42:15,224
Want to smoke?

397
00:42:15,696 --> 00:42:17,698
What if people see us?

398
00:42:19,789 --> 00:42:22,398
Well, he’s a man of his word.

399
00:42:23,094 --> 00:42:24,933
He’ll definitely give you a role

400
00:42:24,934 --> 00:42:26,598
for his next movie, for sure.

401
00:42:26,702 --> 00:42:28,946
Then you owe me big.

402
00:42:29,686 --> 00:42:31,908
Sure…

403
00:42:39,297 --> 00:42:40,590
Nam Joon…

404
00:42:41,304 --> 00:42:42,305
Yeah?

405
00:42:44,296 --> 00:42:46,631
Are you still doing?

406
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:48,925
Doing what?

407
00:42:50,594 --> 00:42:52,637
You know,

408
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:55,473
the drugs.

409
00:42:57,594 --> 00:42:59,768
Why are you asking?

410
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,437
Excuse me…

411
00:43:02,272 --> 00:43:04,899
Aren’t you that actress… Su An?

412
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,231
Yes, I am.

413
00:43:06,232 --> 00:43:08,310
I’m a huge fan.

414
00:43:08,311 --> 00:43:09,904
Do you mind..?

415
00:43:09,905 --> 00:43:12,114
- No, not at all.
- Thank you so much!

416
00:43:12,908 --> 00:43:15,034
I’ll call you later, mom.

417
00:43:16,387 --> 00:43:17,370
What?

418
00:43:20,284 --> 00:43:21,623
Where are you?

419
00:43:24,697 --> 00:43:27,505
Okay, I’ll transfer it.

420
00:43:27,964 --> 00:43:30,882
Would it be alright if I ask for a picture?

421
00:43:30,884 --> 00:43:33,503
I’m not looking my best,
though, is that okay?

422
00:43:33,504 --> 00:43:36,217
No, no, you look beautiful!

423
00:43:36,218 --> 00:43:37,592
Should I take it for you?

424
00:43:37,593 --> 00:43:39,850
Yes… Thank you so much.

425
00:43:42,604 --> 00:43:46,315
Smile! One, two, three!

426
00:43:52,598 --> 00:43:54,908
Stop it, stop…

427
00:44:12,207 --> 00:44:13,818
Stop.

428
00:44:14,192 --> 00:44:15,751
I said, stop.

429
00:44:27,405 --> 00:44:28,565
Tell me.

430
00:44:30,106 --> 00:44:31,610
- It’ll be okay.
- I think…

431
00:44:34,495 --> 00:44:37,915
It’s better if I don’t do

432
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:48,628
the role you got me.

433
00:44:51,373 --> 00:44:52,631
Why all of a sudden?

434
00:44:56,188 --> 00:44:58,513
I might quit acting.

435
00:44:59,304 --> 00:45:03,393
Never thought I’d hear that.

436
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:05,436
I’m serious.

437
00:45:08,006 --> 00:45:11,426
You’ve come so far, why now?

438
00:45:11,886 --> 00:45:14,430
How did I even get here?

439
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:20,743
I…

440
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:29,544
I was just acting anyhow.

441
00:45:30,385 --> 00:45:33,672
I don’t even know what to do with my hands.

442
00:45:34,093 --> 00:45:37,207
That feeling, realizing my acting is

443
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:38,928
terrible on stage.

444
00:45:40,512 --> 00:45:44,517
You wouldn’t understand.

445
00:45:47,804 --> 00:45:52,315
I’m the seagull.

446
00:45:57,698 --> 00:45:58,823
No,

447
00:45:59,408 --> 00:46:01,118
I’m an actress.

448
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,328
No,

449
00:46:04,592 --> 00:46:06,180
I’m a seagull.

450
00:46:09,208 --> 00:46:11,043
What am I saying?

451
00:46:11,321 --> 00:46:13,087
What are you talking about?

452
00:46:14,006 --> 00:46:15,715
I think it’s hitting me!

453
00:46:33,189 --> 00:46:35,192
I need more.

454
00:46:37,091 --> 00:46:38,362
Here it is!

455
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,449
It’s beautiful.

456
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:42,783
What is it?

457
00:46:43,902 --> 00:46:45,822
You don’t need to know, kid.

458
00:46:46,393 --> 00:46:47,728
Give me some.

459
00:46:48,492 --> 00:46:49,785
This…

460
00:46:49,985 --> 00:46:52,835
Do you know what happens if you take this?

461
00:46:54,177 --> 00:46:56,631
Hey… Hey…

462
00:46:59,811 --> 00:47:01,510
What’ll happen?

463
00:47:05,587 --> 00:47:06,724
Don’t swallow it.

464
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:09,226
Spit it out.

465
00:47:29,614 --> 00:47:30,748
It's okay.

466
00:47:32,209 --> 00:47:35,085
You could be in big trouble…

467
00:47:35,306 --> 00:47:36,254
Su An?

468
00:47:39,784 --> 00:47:40,904
No, no, it’s fine.

469
00:47:40,905 --> 00:47:43,406
Stay right here.

470
00:48:37,899 --> 00:48:38,994
Hi, Nam Joon.

471
00:48:38,995 --> 00:48:40,376
<i>Lee Su An, where are you!</i>

472
00:48:40,594 --> 00:48:41,719
<i>Where are you?</i>

473
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:45,531
<i>- Hey!</i>
- I’m at the ocean…

474
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:47,742
<i>What?</i>

475
00:48:48,305 --> 00:48:50,641
<i>What ocean? You’re in the middle of Seoul!</i>

476
00:48:50,996 --> 00:48:52,038
Hey, you…

477
00:50:52,993 --> 00:50:54,201
Lee Su An.

478
00:50:58,707 --> 00:50:59,957
You feeling better?

479
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:03,210
Are you coming down?

480
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:10,634
Good…

481
00:51:18,209 --> 00:51:19,477
Do you want to sleep more?

482
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:51,508
[The sea]

483
00:51:58,306 --> 00:52:00,993
[Snow is drifting.]

484
00:52:03,313 --> 00:52:05,209
[Reunited]

485
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:14,489
[The sea]

486
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,068
Let’s have a drink together, please?

487
00:54:18,915 --> 00:54:20,032
Come on.

488
00:54:27,405 --> 00:54:29,603
Two shots of vodka, please.

489
00:54:29,795 --> 00:54:30,918
They’re on me.

490
00:54:32,898 --> 00:54:34,408
Put it on my tab.

491
00:54:34,409 --> 00:54:35,839
I said, no, thanks.

492
00:54:37,297 --> 00:54:39,343
How long are you going to ignore me?

493
00:54:45,011 --> 00:54:46,487
Do you have any idea how long

494
00:54:46,488 --> 00:54:47,810
I’ve been looking for you?

495
00:54:51,695 --> 00:54:52,946
Have a seat.

496
00:55:03,402 --> 00:55:05,243
It’s been a while.

497
00:55:12,001 --> 00:55:13,752
Why did you avoid me?

498
00:55:15,096 --> 00:55:17,964
I just had a lot on my mind.

499
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:31,145
You’re still so pretty…

500
00:55:36,193 --> 00:55:37,734
Still?

501
00:55:39,989 --> 00:55:42,698
You’re not just pretty.

502
00:55:44,221 --> 00:55:46,994
You got more unique, somehow.

503
00:56:12,201 --> 00:56:13,437
How about now?

504
00:56:14,773 --> 00:56:16,523
Am I still pretty?

505
00:56:23,408 --> 00:56:25,493
Why are you doing this to yourself?

506
00:56:38,713 --> 00:56:41,256
So, how did you get into surfing?

507
00:56:44,385 --> 00:56:45,552
Not really sure…

508
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:50,850
It just happened.

509
00:56:55,283 --> 00:56:56,396
What’s it like,

510
00:56:57,107 --> 00:56:58,940
being out on the waves?

511
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,489
Is it thrilling?

512
00:57:09,285 --> 00:57:11,078
It’s different.

513
00:57:12,205 --> 00:57:15,198
When I’m on the waves…

514
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:17,125
My mind just goes blank.

515
00:57:19,207 --> 00:57:20,587
That’s what I like about it.

516
00:57:26,511 --> 00:57:28,262
What brought you here?

517
00:57:32,287 --> 00:57:34,226
I’ve had a lot going on…

518
00:57:40,191 --> 00:57:43,277
Before I knew it, I ended up here.

519
00:57:53,402 --> 00:57:55,039
I’m heading this way.

520
00:57:59,002 --> 00:58:00,377
Do you live around here?

521
00:58:02,184 --> 00:58:03,037
Yeah,

522
00:58:04,201 --> 00:58:05,632
I work here too…

523
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:14,809
I was just about to leave.

524
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:15,851
Well…

525
00:58:21,691 --> 00:58:24,120
Can we have one more drink?

526
00:58:33,104 --> 00:58:34,703
I want to stay for a night.

527
00:58:41,711 --> 00:58:43,837
I think you should go.

528
00:58:49,701 --> 00:58:51,845
Am I making you uncomfortable?

529
01:00:51,883 --> 01:00:52,916
When you’re in the lineup,

530
01:00:52,917 --> 01:00:54,426
you should know how to read the waves.

531
01:00:55,502 --> 01:00:57,755
The waves change every day.

532
01:01:01,184 --> 01:01:03,061
The best waves are the ones

533
01:01:03,062 --> 01:01:05,062
that break from the peak.

534
01:01:05,813 --> 01:01:08,040
Surfers ride the wave right

535
01:01:08,041 --> 01:01:09,566
before it breaks.

536
01:01:13,209 --> 01:01:14,862
So it’s important to observe and judge

537
01:01:14,863 --> 01:01:16,614
the waves well.

538
01:01:23,007 --> 01:01:24,164
Look.

539
01:02:24,396 --> 01:02:26,128
So refreshing.

540
01:02:31,896 --> 01:02:34,315
Next time, let’s head out
to the waves together.

541
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:42,923
Don’t come looking for me anymore.

542
01:02:46,414 --> 01:02:47,621
I will.

543
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:01,207
I’m not leaving.

544
01:03:08,179 --> 01:03:10,017
Why are you doing this now?

545
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:16,897
I have the right to do so.

546
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:00,815
You feeling okay?

547
01:06:05,693 --> 01:06:06,777
Hey…

548
01:06:13,996 --> 01:06:16,133
Why do you keep showing up like this?

549
01:06:39,598 --> 01:06:41,439
I don’t think I’ll be hitting the waves

550
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,733
anytime soon.

551
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:05,046
You really like to be alone?

552
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:21,813
Make sure you practice what I taught you.

553
01:08:20,618 --> 01:08:21,744
Seol.

554
01:08:25,085 --> 01:08:26,419
Look over there.

555
01:08:32,468 --> 01:08:34,302
Feels otherworldly.

556
01:08:35,992 --> 01:08:37,013
Doesn’t it?

557
01:08:38,902 --> 01:08:40,934
Yeah, like we’re in another world.

558
01:08:46,398 --> 01:08:48,400
Do some warm-up stretches.

559
01:08:49,895 --> 01:08:51,945
I’ll go check the water.

560
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:15,843
Seol!

561
01:09:20,683 --> 01:09:22,517
Are you in there?

562
01:09:26,313 --> 01:09:28,439
Seol, where are you?

563
01:09:52,909 --> 01:09:54,119
Su An!

564
01:10:04,184 --> 01:10:05,393
Su An!

565
01:10:18,908 --> 01:10:20,658
Su An, where are you?

566
01:10:21,478 --> 01:10:23,411
I’m here!

567
01:10:23,805 --> 01:10:26,497
Stay there! I’ll come to you!

568
01:10:38,906 --> 01:10:41,095
Seol, here!

569
01:10:49,313 --> 01:10:50,521
Are you okay?

570
01:10:50,981 --> 01:10:52,064
Yeah.

571
01:10:56,904 --> 01:10:58,822
We got caught in the current.

572
01:11:00,706 --> 01:11:02,825
So… Where are we?

573
01:11:05,405 --> 01:11:06,955
I don’t know.

574
01:11:07,198 --> 01:11:08,997
I have no idea.

575
01:12:02,801 --> 01:12:03,694
Look!

576
01:12:04,192 --> 01:12:05,972
I see something.

577
01:12:10,602 --> 01:12:12,020
Seol, are you okay?

578
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:14,229
Let’s go check.

579
01:12:39,214 --> 01:12:40,506
Is anyone there?

580
01:12:43,015 --> 01:12:44,308
Hello, anyone?

581
01:13:28,103 --> 01:13:29,896
Is anyone there?

582
01:13:33,089 --> 01:13:35,311
Somebody help us!

583
01:13:55,884 --> 01:13:56,832
Seol!

584
01:13:58,403 --> 01:13:59,878
Seol, what’s wrong?

585
01:14:10,472 --> 01:14:11,682
Seol…

586
01:14:19,273 --> 01:14:20,482
Medicine…

587
01:14:21,287 --> 01:14:24,084
Seol, please… please…

588
01:14:24,185 --> 01:14:27,988
I need my medicine…

589
01:14:52,014 --> 01:14:54,223
Help, please help!

590
01:15:29,593 --> 01:15:31,720
I’ve been looking for you too.

591
01:15:33,013 --> 01:15:35,015
Seems like you went pretty far.

592
01:15:39,198 --> 01:15:40,769
Are you feeling better?

593
01:15:42,298 --> 01:15:43,383
Yeah.

594
01:16:04,601 --> 01:16:06,603
Maybe, we really are dead.

595
01:16:13,396 --> 01:16:15,826
Then, is this the afterlife?

596
01:16:17,395 --> 01:16:19,017
It could be.

597
01:16:24,590 --> 01:16:27,733
All of a sudden, everything feels surreal.

598
01:16:33,094 --> 01:16:34,073
Why?

599
01:16:39,201 --> 01:16:40,621
Should we go out and check?

600
01:16:48,281 --> 01:16:50,198
I don’t think this is the right way either.

601
01:17:29,912 --> 01:17:31,214
- What?
- What?

602
01:17:39,495 --> 01:17:40,495
Hey!

603
01:17:48,879 --> 01:17:49,909
Stop it!

604
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:51,984
Cut it out!

605
01:18:16,385 --> 01:18:17,384
Hey! Hey!

606
01:18:19,805 --> 01:18:21,805
Stop it already!

607
01:18:26,805 --> 01:18:29,120
I keep thinking about

608
01:18:31,703 --> 01:18:33,727
how hard it must’ve been

609
01:18:33,728 --> 01:18:35,569
for you to get here,

610
01:18:37,189 --> 01:18:39,448
enduring so much along the way.

611
01:18:43,912 --> 01:18:46,372
So when I think about you,

612
01:18:47,787 --> 01:18:49,958
my heart aches.

613
01:18:53,903 --> 01:18:55,196
You know…

614
01:18:59,595 --> 01:19:02,388
The feelings you have towards others

615
01:19:04,397 --> 01:19:06,809
might actually be about you.

616
01:19:09,104 --> 01:19:10,604
What do you mean?

617
01:19:14,689 --> 01:19:16,443
There’s something called projection.

618
01:19:17,696 --> 01:19:19,738
You see yourself in others.

619
01:19:27,302 --> 01:19:29,429
What you said to me…

620
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:33,343
Might have been what you really

621
01:19:33,344 --> 01:19:35,003
wanted to tell yourself.

622
01:20:23,711 --> 01:20:25,108
It’s a pity…

623
01:21:28,285 --> 01:21:29,506
Seol!

624
01:21:29,801 --> 01:21:32,121
I’ll try! Keep an eye on me.

625
01:22:59,997 --> 01:23:06,595
HEAVY SNOW
