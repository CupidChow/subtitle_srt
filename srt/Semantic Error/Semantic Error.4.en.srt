I'm impressed you noticed that already.

"Like this."

We can do it on paper.

Is this a secret conversation?

181

So, have you thought of any possible topics?

182
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:28,175
Melodrama.

183
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,543
No way.

184

Let's go with "asking for directions."

That's lame as hell.

Remind me not to design a game with you.

187

You meet the love of your life,

188
00:13:42,397 --> 00:13:46,351
and it turns out you two are siblings.

189
00:13:46,351 --> 00:13:47,126
What bullshit—

190

The professor likes epic melodramas.

I'll make the script.

192
00:13:58,411 --> 00:14:01,511
You can just pick out the lines you like.

193
00:14:01,511 --> 00:14:04,005
You're going to write the script?

194
00:14:04,005 --> 00:14:06,043
Yeah. I'm in the theater club.

195
00:14:06,043 --> 00:14:08,209
I direct sometimes, too.

You thought I would freeload again?

We have a perfectly good script here.

199
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:29,859
But your acting is just terrible.

200
00:14:29,859 --> 00:14:33,193
We'll need more practice than I expected.

201
00:14:33,193 --> 00:14:36,570
Isn't it just the pronunciation that needs to be correct?

202
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,311
Tell me the truth.

203
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,778
Have you ever dated anyone?

204
00:14:40,778 --> 00:14:42,618
What does that have to do with this?

205
00:14:42,618 --> 00:14:46,153
You're ruining the melodrama part completely.

206

Have you ever been in love with anyone?

207
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:58,021
If you're talking about emotional delusions,

208
00:14:58,021 --> 00:15:00,109
then, no.

209
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:01,623
Delusion?

210
00:15:01,623 --> 00:15:06,596
Love is nothing but a delusion they propagate so people will reproduce.

211
00:15:09,249 --> 00:15:12,622
It's unbelievable how narrow-minded you are.

212
00:15:12,622 --> 00:15:15,342
If anything, I'm logical.

213
00:15:18,664 --> 00:15:22,554
Then, what's your definition of dating?

214
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:25,970
It's just the phase that comes before marriage.

215
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:30,570
We could say it's like a beta test for software.

Maybe you changed your strategy, but fraternizing won't work, either.

221
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,773
Strategies are not my thing.
