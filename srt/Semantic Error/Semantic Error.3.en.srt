169
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:32,509
Oh, you're withdrawing from that class next week. Right?

170
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:34,456
Why not take it all the way?

171
00:11:34,456 --> 00:11:35,809
Are you nuts?

172
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:37,960
- You'll like her. 
 - No, thank you.

173
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,910
Come on.

174
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:46,275
Look, it's the Quickst guy.

175
00:11:46,275 --> 00:11:47,645
Perfect timing.

176
00:11:47,645 --> 00:11:50,575
That guy is so much worse when he's drunk.

177
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:52,109
I don't want to see that.

178
00:11:52,109 --> 00:11:54,000
Chu Sangwoo?

179
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,384
Whatever. Let's just drink.

180
00:12:04,796 --> 00:12:08,909
You should have arranged everything before we came in.

181
00:12:08,909 --> 00:12:11,669
Waiting is one of the things I hate the most.

182
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:13,726
You son of a gun.

183
00:12:13,726 --> 00:12:15,468
With this hand, I'll

184
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:20,070
teach you a lesson about being an actual adult.

185
00:12:21,201 --> 00:12:23,433
When will you, kids, grow up?

186
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:26,586
I'll give you a good karate chop

187
00:12:26,586 --> 00:12:29,430
right on your neck, and then…

188
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,409
I'm sorry but I have to get going.

189
00:12:33,824 --> 00:12:35,664
Chu Sangwoo, right?

190
00:12:35,664 --> 00:12:38,499
We still have a lot to discuss.

191
00:12:38,499 --> 00:12:40,594
About that project we talked about,

192
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:44,611
I'll think about it when I get the documents.

193
00:12:44,611 --> 00:12:46,830
Kids these days, like yourself,

194
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,103
simply don't understand how the world works.

195
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:50,642
I'm giving you an opportunity,

196
00:12:50,642 --> 00:12:54,385
and you should be thankful and have a roll-up-your-sleeves attitude.

197
00:12:54,385 --> 00:12:55,747
That's what you need.

198
00:12:55,747 --> 00:12:59,919
I think we should first discuss the issues regarding copyrights.

199
00:13:02,663 --> 00:13:05,996
I'll reach out to you some time soon.

200
00:13:09,553 --> 00:13:12,899
Have some courtesy and finish your drink.

201
00:13:14,606 --> 00:13:15,833
How dare you!

202
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,342
I offer you a drink and you refuse it?

203
00:13:18,342 --> 00:13:20,271
- Show respect! 
 - It was a given.

204
00:13:20,271 --> 00:13:22,375
So annoying.

205
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,257
Should we go to a different place?

206
00:13:24,257 --> 00:13:26,590
Let's finish these and go.

207
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,456
I can drink this.

208
00:13:28,456 --> 00:13:30,869
But I don't want to.

209
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:34,464
I can see you're a bit antisocial,

210
00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:36,781
but this is not the right time or place.

211
00:13:36,781 --> 00:13:37,940
Hands off.

212
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,258
Hey, you.

213
00:13:39,258 --> 00:13:42,075
Are you disrespecting me?

214
00:13:54,332 --> 00:13:57,342
Clearly, you're too drunk.

215
00:13:57,342 --> 00:14:00,332
Do that again and I'm calling the police.

216
00:14:01,672 --> 00:14:04,309
You little punk.

217
00:14:11,594 --> 00:14:13,647
Oops, that was a mistake.

218
00:14:13,647 --> 00:14:16,775
I'm sorry, it slipped out of my fingers.

219
00:14:23,934 --> 00:14:25,642
- Mister. 
 - Yeah?

220
00:14:25,642 --> 00:14:28,197
It's one thing to be drunk,

221
00:14:28,197 --> 00:14:30,809
but if you do that again, I'll…

222
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,457
put a hole right there.

223
00:14:34,244 --> 00:14:35,309
What is this?

224
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:36,515
Are you his backup or what?

225
00:14:36,515 --> 00:14:37,942
- Yeah. 
 - No.

226
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:39,875
What?

227
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,281
I'm with him.

228
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:43,809
Who are you?

229
00:14:45,455 --> 00:14:48,661
Get off of me, asshole!

230
00:14:48,661 --> 00:14:49,881
Hands off.

231
00:14:49,881 --> 00:14:51,775
Let go of this. I'm okay.

232
00:14:51,775 --> 00:14:53,609
I'm fine.

233
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:55,209
Did you just push me?

234
00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:57,375
Shut your hole.

235
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,460
Let's go.

236
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,446
Let go of me!

237
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,731
You messed with the wrong person!

238
00:15:07,731 --> 00:15:10,082
Please, stop!

239
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:29,075
You see,

240
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:32,919
I wasn't stalking you. I just saw you there, okay?

241
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:34,964
I know.

242
00:15:34,964 --> 00:15:36,424
What if he called the police?

243
00:15:36,424 --> 00:15:39,431
I'm a college student and he was drunk.

244
00:15:39,431 --> 00:15:41,088
He wouldn't call the cops.

245
00:15:41,088 --> 00:15:43,700
Even though he is a wacko.

246
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,239
You don't seem worried at all.

247
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,830
Bye.

248
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,009
My bag.

249
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:57,630
My key was in there.

250
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,873
My phone is dead, too.

251
00:16:05,762 --> 00:16:08,249
Hey, Sangwoo.

252
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:10,582
Can I use your laptop?

253
00:16:13,998 --> 00:16:16,105
I don't know my friends' numbers.

254
00:16:16,105 --> 00:16:18,409
I'll message them on SNS.

255
00:16:19,386 --> 00:16:22,409
Why don't you go back to the bar and see?

256
00:16:23,728 --> 00:16:27,275
What if the crazy guy is still there?

257
00:16:27,275 --> 00:16:29,675
I thought you weren't afraid of anything.

258
00:16:29,675 --> 00:16:31,732
I'm not scared of him. It's just that—

259
00:16:31,732 --> 00:16:34,140
I don't let anyone in my place.

260
00:16:40,388 --> 00:16:42,382
Oh, come on.

261
00:16:42,382 --> 00:16:45,140
Ungrateful bastard.

262
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,161
No respect.

263
00:16:53,114 --> 00:16:55,207
Ten minutes.

264
00:16:55,207 --> 00:16:57,373
That will be it.

265
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,240
[SEMANTIC ERROR]

266
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,780
You act like a villain all the time.

267
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,000
You let me in here. Be a good host.

268
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:11,101
Then, what's your definition of romance?

269
00:17:11,101 --> 00:17:13,460
You're always a nuisance.

270
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,985
I must be going crazy.

271
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:17,203
Why am I thinking about him?

272
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:20,648
I'm starting to understand how you process data.

273
00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:22,994
Strategies are not my thing.

274
00:17:22,994 --> 00:17:26,880
I just do what I feel like doing.

275
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,060
♫ You got me stuck ♫

276
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,810
♫ You got me stuck ♫
