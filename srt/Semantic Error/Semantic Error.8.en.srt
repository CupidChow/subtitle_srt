Isn't he the first to do it?

What's going to happen to that game you've been working on?

My company has been following its progress.

So I was going to give them a call.

Is that so?

34
00:02:16,314 --> 00:02:19,308
The reason why they were interested in the first place was because of his design.

35
00:02:19,308 --> 00:02:20,770
So who knows what will happen next?

Before, when I was with Sangchoo,

41
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,342
he asked about everyone you dated before.

You didn't…

43

So I counted all of them with my fingers.

Thankfully, there weren't more than ten.

I said it seemed like you were going to die soon

50

00:15:06,512 --> 00:15:09,109
I thought you would say that.

168
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:12,134
But you're here listening and drinking coffee with me.

169
00:15:12,134 --> 00:15:14,742
I think you've changed.

170
00:15:14,742 --> 00:15:16,409
Me?

171
00:15:16,409 --> 00:15:17,577
Yes.

172
00:15:17,577 --> 00:15:20,167
I think you've improved.

173
00:15:32,605 --> 00:15:35,080
They say love changes a man.

174
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,529
I guess those romance novels weren't fake after all.

175
00:15:39,871 --> 00:15:43,075
I won't be able to cheer for you on the sidelines,

176
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:46,164
but good luck, Mr. Chu.

177
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,412
Is anyone there?

178
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:08,992
Is anyone there?

179
00:16:08,992 --> 00:16:11,009
Who are you?

180
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:13,214
Are you the tenant here?

181
00:16:13,214 --> 00:16:14,575
No.

182
00:16:14,575 --> 00:16:16,701
I'm a real estate agent.

183
00:16:16,701 --> 00:16:19,126
Do you know where this tenant is?

184
00:16:19,126 --> 00:16:21,348
We came to see the place, but no one is answering the phone.

185
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:22,162
This place?

186
00:16:22,162 --> 00:16:24,479
He asked to do it quickly.

187
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:29,811
If you see him, can you please tell him that we came to see the place?

188
00:16:29,811 --> 00:16:32,283
I'm so sorry. Let's go.

189
00:16:45,357 --> 00:16:47,730
I'm relieved that I could give it to you in person.

190
00:16:58,307 --> 00:17:00,310
Hey, Sangchoo.

191
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,564
Jaeyeong cleared out the art room.

192
00:17:05,965 --> 00:17:07,941
Sangwoo.

193
00:17:07,941 --> 00:17:10,175
What is your heart telling you right now?

194
00:17:10,175 --> 00:17:12,305
- Senior… 
 - You said nobody else can do it.

195
00:17:12,305 --> 00:17:13,393
♫ I mean ♫

196
00:17:13,393 --> 00:17:15,420
You said you needed me.

197
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,868
- No, back then— 
 - I feel the same way.

198

♫ I never knew there'd be ♫

199
00:17:18,226 --> 00:17:21,202
I need you, too.

200
00:17:21,202 --> 00:17:25,609
My heart is telling me that.

201

00:17:42,865 --> 00:17:44,510

♫ I'm more certain when I keep seeing you ♫

206

♫ Baby please, can you stay in my life ♫

208

♫ From the first moment I saw you ♫

217
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,298
Let's try

218
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:32,289
to make this work.

219
00:18:32,289 --> 00:18:34,150
Together.

220
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:38,820
♫ The person that is in your heart ♫

221

00:18:50,552 --> 00:18:53,227
Don't avoid it.

224
00:18:53,227 --> 00:18:56,444
Don't ignore it.

225
00:18:56,444 --> 00:18:59,010
Just try and feel it.

226
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,525
Then that lingering doubt

227
00:19:01,525 --> 00:19:03,211
might all just go away.

♫ Just you and me ♫

232
00:19:18,063 --> 00:19:20,580
Chu Sangwoo?

233
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:24,440
- Why are you out here so late? 
 - Why aren't you picking up your phone?

234
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,613
My phone?

235
00:19:25,613 --> 00:19:28,195
I put it on silent.

236
00:19:28,195 --> 00:19:33,110
- Why did you call me so many times? 
 - You're like an error.

237
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,979
What? Error?

238
00:19:33,979 --> 00:19:39,041
Bad personality and have no sense of time. You're also capricious and irrational.

239
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,240
You came here to yell at me?

240
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,654
I don't know why I'm like this.

241
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:59,380
- Sangwoo— 
 - I keep telling myself to send you away.

242
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,780
I know it's pointless to say this to you.

243
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,405
I know that.

244
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,710
But I like you.

245
00:20:11,866 --> 00:20:14,014
I like you, Hyung.

246
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:17,119
I really do.

247
00:20:27,288 --> 00:20:32,015
Can I respond to your request again?

248
00:20:38,145 --> 00:20:39,868
No.

249
00:20:39,868 --> 00:20:42,440
It's already over, so you can't.

250
00:20:45,607 --> 00:20:47,714
But I'll make another request.

251
00:20:55,103 --> 00:20:59,869
Sangwoo, let's date.

252
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,980
Not a trial run.

253
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:06,096
I mean the real thing.

254
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:00,624
I was so nervous.

255
00:22:20,944 --> 00:22:22,385
I already sent it to Dex.

256
00:22:22,385 --> 00:22:24,424
We agreed to discuss this later.

257
00:22:24,424 --> 00:22:27,162
I told them that there's a very good programmer in Korea.

258
00:22:27,162 --> 00:22:31,695
I told them to hire him before another company does.

259
00:22:31,695 --> 00:22:34,787
When did you prepare for all of this?

260
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:38,522
When you said you were going to find my replacement.

261
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,052
What…

262
00:22:43,052 --> 00:22:45,780
Did you think I would let go of you that easily?

263
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:49,961
Then, why are you leaving?

264
00:22:49,961 --> 00:22:52,001
To discuss the final terms with Dex.

265
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:55,338
If they say no, I'm going to finish "Veggie Man" before I leave.

266
00:22:55,338 --> 00:22:59,452
Jaeyeong, if you miss your chance because of emotion…

267
00:22:59,452 --> 00:23:01,217
Are you going to make the game by yourself?

268
00:23:01,217 --> 00:23:04,791
You know I prepared the outline and concept.

269
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:07,441
You're going to do all of it by yourself?

270
00:23:07,441 --> 00:23:10,785
Chu Sangwoo, were you always such a corrupt CEO?

271
00:23:10,785 --> 00:23:12,310
But it's Dex.

272
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,991
Is Dex all that?

273
00:23:13,991 --> 00:23:16,748
I could go to a better place if I wanted.

274
00:23:17,514 --> 00:23:19,780
Don't you know your boyfriend's abilities?

275
00:23:22,961 --> 00:23:25,162
Boyfriend…

276
00:23:25,162 --> 00:23:28,010
I can see you like the sound of that.

277
00:23:31,356 --> 00:23:35,620
Anyways, if you are going to be with me, please be mindful of three things.

278
00:23:36,362 --> 00:23:39,815
Of course. This is so like you.

279
00:23:39,815 --> 00:23:41,610
First...

280
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,948
If you don't want to get caught, lock the door.

281
00:23:51,845 --> 00:23:55,837
You know I locked the door when Choi Yoochae left.

282
00:23:55,837 --> 00:23:58,502
You're so smart.

283

Yes.

297
00:25:01,429 --> 00:25:03,621
I thought there was an issue with the code,

298
00:25:03,621 --> 00:25:06,795
but I just needed to change the output value.

299
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,399
Good job.

300
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:12,980
How's the preparations for the meeting going?

301
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,147
Let's just go to France together.

302
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:17,288
Why do you want to work here in Korea?

303
00:25:17,288 --> 00:25:21,123
I want to start here and expand abroad.

304
00:25:21,123 --> 00:25:22,031
Okay.

305
00:25:22,031 --> 00:25:25,208
I guess I went against the CEO's suggestion again.

306
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:27,340
You don't believe me?

307
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:33,709
I believe you.

308
00:25:33,709 --> 00:25:35,680
But you're not that good with Powerpoint.

309
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,311
Aren't you giving a presentation tomorrow?

310
00:25:37,311 --> 00:25:38,111
Why?

311
00:25:38,111 --> 00:25:39,440
I'm good at making one now.

312
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,524
As if.

313
00:25:43,173 --> 00:25:46,399
Why did you put this character here?

314
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:47,421
Well…

315
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:51,809
Blue-colored characters instill trust in people.

316
00:25:52,577 --> 00:25:54,480
I'm deleting it.

317
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,605
Your taste is still the same.

318
00:25:58,605 --> 00:26:01,110
That's why I like you.

319
00:26:10,006 --> 00:26:13,619
We won't finish today if you keep looking at me like that.

320
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:16,010
I'm just observing you.

321
00:26:16,755 --> 00:26:18,902
I'm going to the bathroom.

322
00:26:18,902 --> 00:26:21,480
Don't touch anything.

323
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:29,457
Damn…

324
00:26:29,457 --> 00:26:32,412
Do you have any other templates?

What is this?

326
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,220
Jang Jaeyeong?

327
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:56,528
He's such a pervert.

328
00:26:57,898 --> 00:26:58,925
Wait!

329
00:26:58,925 --> 00:27:00,960
- What is this?
