00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:06,290
What's up?

171
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,270
It's midnight and I haven't received anything.

172
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,123
Oh, that's why you called?

173
00:12:12,123 --> 00:12:15,151
It'll be ready by tomorrow.

174
00:12:16,273 --> 00:12:18,573
Senior.

175
00:12:18,573 --> 00:12:20,780
Yeah?

176
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,342
Are you playing pool?

177
00:12:24,434 --> 00:12:26,742
Please respect the deadline from now on.

178
00:12:26,742 --> 00:12:29,810
Okay. I will.

179
00:12:35,425 --> 00:12:37,645
Chu Sangwoo,

180
00:12:37,645 --> 00:12:40,832
I prefer this over texting.

181
00:12:40,832 --> 00:12:42,595
Why?

182
00:12:43,455 --> 00:12:45,068
No reason.

183
00:12:45,948 --> 00:12:48,175
I just like it better.

184
00:12:49,653 --> 00:12:51,586
Good night.

185
00:12:52,246 --> 00:12:54,186
You, too.

186
00:13:11,162 --> 00:13:12,535
I'm going home, okay?

187
00:13:12,535 --> 00:13:14,449
You grab the check.

188
00:13:14,449 --> 00:13:16,655
But this was your idea.

189
00:13:28,243 --> 00:13:31,042
Hyung. Hyung.

190
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:32,542
Hyung.

191
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:33,663
Do you not hear me?

192
00:13:33,663 --> 00:13:34,631
Hey, Hyung!

193
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:36,013
Can't you see I'm busy?

194
00:13:36,013 --> 00:13:37,807
We have an emergency.

195
00:13:37,807 --> 00:13:39,143
Do you remember these guys?

196
00:13:39,143 --> 00:13:40,953
What?

197
00:13:42,754 --> 00:13:44,321
What?

198
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:48,245
That Jihye you've been talking about was this Jihye?

199
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:49,925
What? You know her?

200
00:13:49,925 --> 00:13:51,576
Did you see the guy she was with?

201
00:13:51,576 --> 00:13:53,079
How was he? Was he handsome?

202
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:55,178
Is he tall? Tell me.

203
00:13:56,452 --> 00:13:59,845
He's quite good-looking...

204
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,075
and has a cute smile.

205
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,371
What? Cuter than mine?

206
00:14:05,371 --> 00:14:07,762
Take a look.

207
00:14:07,762 --> 00:14:09,306
Ugh, that's disgusting.

208
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,446
Just go home.

209
00:14:10,446 --> 00:14:13,002
Don't you have class tomorrow morning?

210
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:15,100
This is insane.

211
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,309
Aren't you going home?

Let's go with this.

217
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,763
Good job, really.

218
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,722
Is that the best you can do?

219
00:15:03,722 --> 00:15:05,907
It's impossible to make something like this overnight.

220
00:15:05,907 --> 00:15:07,086
You little devil.

221
00:15:07,086 --> 00:15:09,600
I knew you could do it.

222
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,190
Because it's you.

00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:20,875
What do you like about me?

224
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,685
Be specific.

225
00:15:23,685 --> 00:15:25,116
It's just...

226

You're good overall.

227
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:37,670
By the way, we need to digitalize the characters.

228
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,243
And they'll be animated, too.

229
00:15:39,243 --> 00:15:41,009
So, we'll need the body parts separated.

230
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:44,140
And the format should be PNG...

231
00:15:47,737 --> 00:15:50,020
I'll e-mail you the list of requirements.

Okay.

00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,944
Since you did a good job,

235
00:16:02,944 --> 00:16:06,165
I'll give you a pat on the head.

236
00:16:35,158 --> 00:16:37,111
No way...

237
00:16:45,033 --> 00:16:47,373
What was that?

238
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,440
I don't want to tell you.

239
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,474
That again?

240
00:16:49,474 --> 00:16:50,740
Come on, just tell me.

241
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,649
Tell me what it was.

242
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:54,928
Come on.

243
00:16:58,181 --> 00:17:00,568
I came here with Sangwoo.

244
00:17:00,568 --> 00:17:03,515
I didn't expect to see you here.

245
00:17:03,515 --> 00:17:05,041
Same here.

246
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:08,410
I didn't know he invited you, too.

247
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,881
I guess you just never eat alone.

248
00:17:10,881 --> 00:17:12,475
Of course.

249
00:17:12,475 --> 00:17:15,740

 - Sit here!

By the way, do you have a girlfriend, Jaeyeong?

252
00:17:36,505 --> 00:17:39,745
You're really popular with the girls.

253
00:17:39,745 --> 00:17:42,751
No. I don't have one.

254
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:45,273
I'm having a lot of fun these days thanks to this guy.

255
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:46,973
Sure.

256
00:17:46,973 --> 00:17:48,353
Oh, right, Sangchoo!

257
00:17:48,353 --> 00:17:51,812
How's everything with the rollback problem we discussed before?

258
00:17:54,645 --> 00:17:57,325
It's taken care of.

259
00:17:57,325 --> 00:17:58,452
That's better.

260
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:02,140
If you need any advice from me, I'll be glad to help.

261
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,171
Advice?

262
00:18:05,171 --> 00:18:08,080
You never talk to me about anything.

263
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:12,480
Sangchoo! You're going to the library, right?

264
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,711
- Let's go together. 
 - No.

265
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:16,981
He's coming with me.

266
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:19,040
- Where? 
 - Where?

267
00:18:19,955 --> 00:18:21,782
You know...

268
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,798
You wanted me to fix the files.

269
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:27,515
I can't do that alone. I need you there.

270
00:18:27,515 --> 00:18:29,829
You're coming with me.

271
00:18:29,829 --> 00:18:32,274
Come with me, okay?

272
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,511
Don't make this so difficult.

273
00:18:35,511 --> 00:18:36,445
Let's just go, okay?

274
00:18:36,445 --> 00:18:37,572
Where are we going?

275
00:18:37,572 --> 00:18:40,423
- I have to go to the library— 
 - We can't talk there.

276
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:42,380
Let's go to my studio.

277
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,916
His studio?

278
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,896
What? You don't want to?

279
00:18:47,896 --> 00:18:52,970
It might be good to check your working environment

280
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:56,140
so that we can work more efficiently.

281
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,125
That's what I thought.

282
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,800
Let's go.

283
00:19:25,152 --> 00:19:27,572
Are you a Dex fan, too?

284
00:19:28,706 --> 00:19:30,119
Yeah.

285
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:33,447
The quality is always good. And they're also popular.

286
00:19:33,447 --> 00:19:35,672
Is that the best compliment you can give?

287
00:19:35,672 --> 00:19:38,380
I'll make some room for you.

288
00:19:50,968 --> 00:19:53,515
What? Chu Sangchoo?

289
00:19:53,515 --> 00:19:55,448
What?

290
00:19:56,648 --> 00:19:57,895
Sorry about that.

291
00:19:57,895 --> 00:20:00,034
That's a funny name, really.

292
00:20:00,034 --> 00:20:01,310
Interesting.

293
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,680
Will you just stop?

294
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,773
What?

295
00:20:03,773 --> 00:20:07,420
You can just sit over here and ignore her.

296
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,066
Take out the trash.

297
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:20,861
What?

298
00:20:20,861 --> 00:20:23,554
Right now.

299
00:20:23,554 --> 00:20:24,693
Now?

300
00:20:24,693 --> 00:20:26,607
Now.

301
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:58,755
Are you happy now?

302
00:20:58,755 --> 00:21:01,341
You're the guest here, not the boss.

303
00:21:01,341 --> 00:21:06,048
I actually find it funny that you're the one saying that now.

304
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,580
Was that supposed to be a joke?

305
00:21:10,313 --> 00:21:11,519
Excuse me.

306
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,939
There are other people in here, so could you be quiet?

307
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:16,932
You have really nice headphones.

308
00:21:16,932 --> 00:21:18,339
Put those on.

309
00:21:18,339 --> 00:21:20,046
What?

310
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:44,592
Who could imagine him working in my studio?

311
00:21:44,592 --> 00:21:48,210
It will be tough to make the prototype by next week.

312
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,731
But this is our chance to work with major companies.

313
00:21:50,731 --> 00:21:52,078
We should at least try.

314
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:55,584
It looks like Suyeong really told a lot of people about this.

315
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,928
Are you sure you can keep up with your studies?

316
00:21:58,928 --> 00:22:00,841
I'm feeling really well these days.

317
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:03,055
I can focus better.

318
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:06,280
Is it because I'm not in class?

319
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,040
That's not it.

320
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,487
Then?

321
00:22:12,979 --> 00:22:14,781
- I don't wa— 
 - "Don't want to tell you."

322
00:22:14,781 --> 00:22:16,894
That again? Really?

323
00:22:16,894 --> 00:22:19,210
You might as well quit asking.

324
00:22:22,616 --> 00:22:25,316
Why are you making a game, anyway?

325
00:22:26,216 --> 00:22:29,769
With your grades, you can easily land a job without this project.

326
00:22:30,411 --> 00:22:32,437
Because I like it.

327
00:22:32,437 --> 00:22:35,910
I didn't know robots could "like" something.

328
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:39,140
Everybody has the same starting point in games.

329
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:42,926
They're rewarded for what they do.

330
00:22:42,926 --> 00:22:46,110
I like the idea of fair and honest achievement.

331
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,500
Sangwoo?

332
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:53,194

I wouldn't hate it...

00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:11,614
♫ No need for any fancy words ♫

340
00:23:11,614 --> 00:23:14,607
...if you just tell me in advance.

341
00:23:14,607 --> 00:23:17,343
♫ I just want you to know that I'm sincere ♫

342
00:23:17,343 --> 00:23:19,736
So...

343
00:23:19,736 --> 00:23:25,027
♫ It is now clear how I feel about you ♫

344
00:23:25,027 --> 00:23:27,081
♫ I think about you, and I know it's true ♫

345
00:23:27,081 --> 00:23:30,021
Because you like it,

346
00:23:30,021 --> 00:23:32,087
let's give it our best...

347
00:23:32,087 --> 00:23:35,625
together.

348
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:38,881
♫ I want to sit down next to you ♫

349
00:23:38,881 --> 00:23:41,541
♫ And whisper love in your ear ♫

350
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:46,617
♫ Baby, please, can you stay in my life ♫

351
00:23:46,617 --> 00:23:50,085
♫ I want to sit down next to you ♫

352
00:23:50,085 --> 00:23:52,486
♫ And whisper love in your ear ♫

353
00:23:52,486 --> 00:23:57,783
♫ Baby, please, can you stay in my life ♫

354
00:23:57,783 --> 00:24:00,720
♫ Last night in my dream ♫

355
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,400
♫ Alone, with you ♫

356
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,930
Save.

357
00:24:12,817 --> 00:24:14,690
Do not save?

358
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,350
No way!

359
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,703
I didn't save it!

360
00:24:19,703 --> 00:24:21,842
What have you done?

361
00:24:21,842 --> 00:24:24,362
Oh, come on.

362
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:26,183
Why don't you get some sleep?

363
00:24:26,183 --> 00:24:30,140
You're making mistakes because your brain doesn't have active oxygen.

364
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,940
What a way to say that you're worried.

365
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,137
I'll sleep for half an hour.

366
00:24:36,137 --> 00:24:37,310
Don't forget to wake me up.

367
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,737
Remember.

368
00:24:38,737 --> 00:24:41,161
I'm already thinking of fun ways to wake you up.

369
00:24:41,161 --> 00:24:42,554
So, don't worry.

370
00:24:42,554 --> 00:24:45,320
The worst boss ever.

371
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:22,352
Senior.

372
00:25:23,845 --> 00:25:25,765
Are you asleep?

373
00:25:39,785 --> 00:25:42,105
Hyung,

374
00:25:42,105 --> 00:25:44,039
are you asleep?

375
00:25:47,283 --> 00:25:49,976
You're not joking with me, right?

376
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,310
Hyung.

377
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:35,010

[SEMANTIC ERROR]

379
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:41,211
Listen, Jang Jaeyeong.

380
00:26:41,211 --> 00:26:42,057
Yeah.

381
00:26:42,057 --> 00:26:42,970
Hyung.

382
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,463
What are you saying? You want to date me?

383
00:26:45,463 --> 00:26:46,880
Why not?

384
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,367
Aren't you into me?

385
00:26:48,367 --> 00:26:49,468
I'm into you.

386
00:26:49,468 --> 00:26:50,214
Chu Sangwoo.

387
00:26:50,214 --> 00:26:52,510
I need information on Jaeyeong's ex-partners.

388
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,881
Everything you know.

389
00:26:53,881 --> 00:26:56,810
I heard it's some kind of an endurance contest.

390
00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:00,581
It means something when somebody goes out of their way.

391
00:27:00,581 --> 00:27:04,080
Don't avoid it. Don't ignore it.

392
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,750
Just feel it.

393
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:12,370
♫ You got me stuck. You got me stuck. All right ♫
