00:12:26,507 --> 00:12:28,990
Come on.

170
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,014
You have to nip things in the bud.

171
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,073
No matter how many times I drink it, it doesn't get any better.

172
00:12:42,073 --> 00:12:45,342
Sangwoo's taste is very unique, right?

173
00:12:45,342 --> 00:12:48,568
He doesn't drink that anymore.

174
00:12:52,723 --> 00:12:56,889
Hey, Jihye. Do you like me?

175
00:12:56,889 --> 00:12:58,442
Excuse me?

176
00:12:59,223 --> 00:13:03,357
I heard you kept asking Hyeongtak questions about me.

177
00:13:04,106 --> 00:13:09,134
I mean, I was just curious about you.

178
00:13:09,134 --> 00:13:10,207
Then don't confess.

179
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,457
I don't like you.

180
00:13:12,457 --> 00:13:14,475
But I like someone.

181
00:13:15,268 --> 00:13:16,954
Chu Sangwoo.

182
00:13:20,295 --> 00:13:21,855
So just give up already.

183
00:13:21,855 --> 00:13:24,442
You know what his response will be anyways. "I'm sorry."

184
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:27,322
"But I don't want to waste my time."

185
00:13:30,415 --> 00:13:33,642
Thanks for the advice, but I think this is a little too much.

186
00:13:33,642 --> 00:13:38,626
It seems like you and I are in similar circumstances, so why should I give up?

187
00:13:38,626 --> 00:13:40,814
You're right…

188
00:13:40,814 --> 00:13:43,606
Of course, I understand what you're thinking.

189
00:13:43,606 --> 00:13:47,186
Chu Sangwoo has everything going for him.

190
00:13:47,186 --> 00:13:50,096
He's smart, cute,

191
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:53,242
pretty, and has a law-abiding spirit.

192
00:13:53,242 --> 00:13:56,775
He's probably going to make a lot of money in the future.

193
00:13:56,775 --> 00:13:58,168
Why is he like this all of a sudden?

194
00:13:58,168 --> 00:14:00,775
But I'm not thinking of backing away from him.

195
00:14:00,775 --> 00:14:06,475
If you're thinking about being around him, you have to be ready to go against me.

196
00:14:06,475 --> 00:14:09,047
Does Sangchoo know that you're like this?

197
00:14:09,047 --> 00:14:10,249
Of course!

198
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:13,452
We go way back, you know?

199
00:14:16,332 --> 00:14:21,425
But you know. Why are you acting like we're close?

200
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:25,010
Also, how dare you call him Sangchoo?

201
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,853
He said I could.

202
00:14:26,853 --> 00:14:28,442
Yeah, but I don't like it.

203
00:14:28,442 --> 00:14:30,261
Don't do that.

204
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:33,085
If you really have to, call him Mr. Chu.

205
00:14:33,085 --> 00:14:36,319
I'll allow it. "Hey! Mr. Chu!"

206
00:14:36,319 --> 00:14:38,391
Like that.

207
00:14:38,391 --> 00:14:40,553
What?

208
00:14:40,553 --> 00:14:42,377
Mr. Chu?

209
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,482
And I was just about to start studying.

210
00:14:58,482 --> 00:14:59,911
Hey, Chu Sangchoo.

211
00:14:59,911 --> 00:15:01,947
Why are you acting like that?

212
00:15:01,947 --> 00:15:03,506
Want me to call Jaeyeong?

213
00:15:03,506 --> 00:15:05,795
I'm fine.

214
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:08,530
How irritating…

215
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,264
Stop acting like a pitiful bastard,

216
00:15:12,264 --> 00:15:16,312
and ask me anything. I'll tell you everything I know.

217
00:15:22,426 --> 00:15:26,249
Jaeyeong's past relationships and how long they were.

218
00:15:26,249 --> 00:15:28,896
Tell me everything you know.

219
00:15:30,242 --> 00:15:32,076
I hate conversations about dating.

220
00:15:32,076 --> 00:15:33,723
It's not that.

221
00:15:33,723 --> 00:15:38,482
I just need past information in order to understand the future.

222
00:15:38,482 --> 00:15:40,970
It's to measure all variables.

223
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,011
What the hell are you talking about?

224
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:47,409
So you want to know about Jaeyeong's love life, right?

225
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:52,799
If I have to tell you what I know,

226
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:56,416
there's Juyeong, Saebom, and Terry.

227
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:59,893
There's the senior from his department he dated when he was a freshman.

228
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:04,702
And I also fancied him myself, but I already had a girlfriend back then.

229
00:16:04,702 --> 00:16:07,375
Then there's the dance major and the flight attendant.

230
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,820
That's all I know.

231
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,006
But his relationships didn't last long.

232
00:16:12,006 --> 00:16:14,920
And most of the exes were older than him.

233
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,333
Why did he break up with them?

234
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,935
Hey, you know how he is.

235
00:16:18,935 --> 00:16:21,142
He gets tired of things easily and is often impatient.

236
00:16:21,142 --> 00:16:24,784
I don't think he's very serious when it comes to love.

237
00:16:26,455 --> 00:16:28,242
Don't avoid it.

238
00:16:28,242 --> 00:16:30,075
And don't ignore it.

239
00:16:30,075 --> 00:16:32,216
Just try and feel it.

240
00:16:34,088 --> 00:16:39,836
Then that lingering doubt might all just go away.

241
00:16:39,836 --> 00:16:41,680
They also said this.

242
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,717
He didn't show much affection and was often blunt.

243
00:16:45,717 --> 00:16:50,199
It just made them feel unwanted.

244
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:52,166
Really?

245
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,638
Why? I guess he's not like that around you.

246
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:58,119
- I told you it's not like that. 
 - Okay, okay.

247
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,706
But I think he's changed.

248
00:17:04,292 --> 00:17:06,878
An endurance test? He said that's what he's doing right now.

249
00:17:06,878 --> 00:17:08,312
A guy like him?

250
00:17:08,312 --> 00:17:10,880
That means he's going to die soon.

251
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,435
Hey, you're his friend.

252
00:17:12,435 --> 00:17:14,249
Don't you think you're being a little too harsh?

253
00:17:14,249 --> 00:17:17,034
You got pretty angry for someone who's not in a relationship with him.

254
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:25,425
Anyway, I may not know who he really is,

255
00:17:25,425 --> 00:17:27,810
but he seems serious about it.

256
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,540
If someone

257
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,618
does something he or she has never done before, it must be something special.

258
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:36,128
Wouldn't you agree, Chu Sangchoo?

259
00:17:36,837 --> 00:17:39,910
Thank you for giving me the information,

260
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:43,137
but please don't change my name like that.

261
00:17:43,905 --> 00:17:46,255
How would you feel if I called you Choi Yoochae?

262
00:17:46,255 --> 00:17:49,179
I like it. I feel like we're close.

263
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,770
Then I'll call you Miss Choi Yoochae.

264
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,170
That's fine by me, Mr. Chu Sangchoo.

265
00:17:56,637 --> 00:17:58,614
Time to go on a date.

266
00:18:04,145 --> 00:18:06,505
You're so bad, Jaeyeong.

267
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:15,498
You're here just in time.

268
00:18:16,425 --> 00:18:18,171
Go inside.

269
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:47,094
I thought you asked for some time to think. Why are you here?

270
00:18:47,094 --> 00:18:49,240
I thought we agreed to work on the game together.

271
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,669
It's hard to get a "I missed you" from you.

272
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:54,410
When are you going to start being honest with me?

273
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,116
Think however you want.

274
00:18:56,116 --> 00:18:58,280
It's your choice to be deluded.

275
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,012
So we first change the rendering, right?

276
00:19:26,341 --> 00:19:29,507
Why? Does this make me look like a gangster?

277
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,110
Kind of?

278
00:19:34,935 --> 00:19:37,364
Does it have some kind of meaning?

279
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,314
Not really.

280
00:19:40,314 --> 00:19:42,520
I just liked it.

281
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,940
Do you want one?

282
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,980
It's fine.

283
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:53,610
Hang on.

284
00:19:56,146 --> 00:19:59,212
I just thought of one that would fit you.

285
00:20:07,234 --> 00:20:09,387
What are you drawing?

286
00:20:12,832 --> 00:20:14,905
Something you like.

287
00:20:47,804 --> 00:20:51,617
You like it? You keep looking at it.

288
00:20:53,623 --> 00:20:56,818
It's going to take a while to erase it.

289
00:20:56,818 --> 00:21:00,921
It took me a while to draw it, so it shouldn't be easy to erase.

290
00:21:04,557 --> 00:21:06,307
Senior.

291
00:21:08,162 --> 00:21:09,376
Yeah?

292
00:21:12,109 --> 00:21:17,109
What can we do during the two-week trial?

293
00:21:20,504 --> 00:21:24,017
I'm not going to make the decision now.

294
00:21:25,655 --> 00:21:28,040
You get to hold my hand.

295
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:35,080
And kissing, we already did.

296
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,980
The preview ends there.

297
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:59,576
How was it? Do you want to purchase the full thing?

298
00:22:00,697 --> 00:22:01,910
I don't like it.

299
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,076
Hey, I could see it on your face that you wanted to buy it.

300
00:22:04,076 --> 00:22:05,636
- That's not true. 
 - It is true.

301
00:22:05,636 --> 00:22:07,740
I said it's not true.

302
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,766
♫ It was like time ♫

303
00:22:16,766 --> 00:22:18,337
If someone

304
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,640
does something he or she has never done before, it must be something special.

305
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,089
♫ I mean when I first saw you ♫

306
00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:29,977
♫ I never knew there'd be a day like this ever in my life ♫

307
00:22:29,977 --> 00:22:33,221
Should I try

308
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:35,526
for just two weeks?

309
00:22:37,226 --> 00:22:42,047
♫ No need for any fancy words that will give you flutters ♫

310
00:22:42,047 --> 00:22:47,035
♫ I just want you to know that I'm sincere ♫

♫ It is now clear how I feel about you ♫

312
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:57,810
"I'll announce the results from my analysis."

313
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,725
♫ Baby please ♫

314
00:22:59,725 --> 00:23:03,133
Was that a little too formal?

315
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:06,192
"I'll accept your proposal."

316
00:23:06,192 --> 00:23:08,868
"Let's do a trial run together."

♫ I want to sit down next to you ♫

319
00:23:16,921 --> 00:23:18,210
That's crazy!

320
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,512
Is that really from Dex?

321
00:23:19,512 --> 00:23:22,521
- Is it real? 
 -  Just a bit more.

322
00:23:22,521 --> 00:23:24,015
That hurts, dude.

323
00:23:24,015 --> 00:23:26,430
- That's crazy! 
 - I'm so jealous.

324
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,910
Wow, for real.

325
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:30,399
Hey, I have something to tell you.

326
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:32,764
You came, Sangwoo?

327
00:23:32,764 --> 00:23:33,950
Move, dude.

328
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:36,420
He needs to talk to me.

329
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,201
What is it?

330
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,025
