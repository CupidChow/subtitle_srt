00:00:50,082 --> 00:00:53,082
(Ichiro) Saburo Jiro Come quickly

3
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:01,026
(Saburo) Hmm...

00:01:01,026 --> 00:01:21,046
・～

5
00:01:21,046 --> 00:01:34,059
・～

6
00:01:34,059 --> 00:01:37,059
・(Takeo) Hey! You guys!

7
00:01:39,064 --> 00:01:44,069
Jiro! Saburo!

8
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:47,072
(Jiro and Saburo's frightening voices)

9
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:54,079
(Takeo) Jiro! Saburo!

10
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,082
(Jiro) Ah... Wow!

11
00:01:57,082 --> 00:01:59,082
(Takeo) Ichiro!

12
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:03,019
This shitty brat

13
00:02:05,023 --> 00:02:07,025
Uh uh

14
00:02:07,025 --> 00:02:09,025
(Takeo) Drop it!

15
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:13,031
Ichiro!

16
00:02:13,031 --> 00:02:22,040
・～

17
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,043
Ichiro!

18
00:02:25,043 --> 00:02:28,046
This kid

19
00:02:28,046 --> 00:02:30,046
Hmm! Ah!

20
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,053
Ah! This... this

21
00:02:35,053 --> 00:02:37,055
Wow!

22
00:02:37,055 --> 00:02:39,057
Damn brat! Ah!

23
00:02:39,057 --> 00:02:42,060
(Groaning)

24
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,064
Wow! Ah!

25
00:02:46,064 --> 00:02:49,067
(Groaning)

26
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:52,070
(Jiro and Saburo's cry) (Takeo) Who did it?

27
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:58,076
(Jiro and Saburo's cry)

28
00:02:58,076 --> 00:03:00,011
Who is it?

29
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:04,015
Saburo! Tell me!

30
00:03:04,015 --> 00:03:06,015
Who did it?

31
00:03:11,022 --> 00:03:14,025
Saburo! Who did it! (Crying voice)

32
00:03:14,025 --> 00:03:18,029
Hey! Jiro! (Crying voice)

33
00:03:18,029 --> 00:03:21,032
Tell me! Who is it? (Jiro and Saburo crying)

34
00:03:21,032 --> 00:03:24,035
Ichiro! Is it you? (Groaning)

35
00:03:24,035 --> 00:03:27,038
Did you do it? Uhh uh ah!

36
00:03:27,038 --> 00:03:29,040
Hey!

37
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,045
What? What is those eyes!

38
00:03:34,045 --> 00:03:38,045
Do you hate it? Do you hate me?

39
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:43,054
I wonder who he looks like!

40
00:03:43,054 --> 00:03:47,058
Damn brat! Ah! Ah...

41
00:03:47,058 --> 00:03:52,058
(Three cries)

42
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:04,007
big brother! big brother!

43
00:04:06,011 --> 00:04:10,015
(Takeo) Ichiro! Ichiro!

44
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:14,019
Hey Ichiro! Ichiro!

45
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:16,021
(Jiro Saburo) Big Brother! (Takeo) Ichiro!

46
00:04:16,021 --> 00:04:18,021
(Jiro Saburo) Big Brother!

47
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:32,035
The damn brat...

48
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,040
Saburo Jiro Leave it alone

49
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:18,012
(Iida) This time... Ah, thank you very much

50
00:05:26,024 --> 00:05:31,024
(Suzuki chant)

51
00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:10,001
(Strait) Erlangjun

52
00:06:10,001 --> 00:06:12,001
a little bit

53
00:06:15,006 --> 00:06:18,009
At times like this,

54
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:22,013
Outlet malls scheduled to be constructed next year

55
00:06:22,013 --> 00:06:27,018
It looks like it's going to overlap with the land that my father had held.

56
00:06:27,018 --> 00:06:30,021
I think the city will buy the land.

57
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:33,024
Here, only inheritance is solid

58
00:06:33,024 --> 00:06:35,026
yes

59
00:06:35,026 --> 00:06:38,029
People who live there will do something over here

60
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:40,029
Hey (Wakabayashi) Ah

61
00:06:43,034 --> 00:06:46,037
Construction plan

62
00:06:46,037 --> 00:06:49,040
So please

63
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,040
yes

64
00:06:59,984 --> 00:07:04,989
Thank you very much for Professor Oizumi today

65
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:07,992
I think my dad is happy too

66
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:13,998
(Oizumi) Grandpa was a great person who made this town bigger.

67
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:18,002
I have to become a great politician once I grow up.

68
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:23,007
Would the mayor be good? Ahahaha...

69
00:07:23,007 --> 00:07:26,007
(Miki) Daichi: See, what's "Yes"?

70
00:07:28,012 --> 00:07:30,014
Sorry this kid...

71
00:07:30,014 --> 00:07:35,019
(Kishi) Are you shy like your father? Haha

72
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:38,019
Well, please

73
00:07:40,024 --> 00:07:42,024
thank you very much

74
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:47,028
(The sound of the door opening)

75
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:52,033
(Kanshi) Good morning (sound of door closing)

76
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,039
(Hiroshi) Manager Good morning

77
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:01,043
Good morning

78
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:06,985
Come on, wake up, come on, wake up, yes

79
00:08:06,985 --> 00:08:08,987
Yes Good morning

80
00:08:08,987 --> 00:08:12,991
Yes yes yes yes... yes yes

81
00:08:12,991 --> 00:08:15,994
(Aya and the others)

82
00:08:15,994 --> 00:08:17,996
(Hiroshi) Manager, it's the phone

83
00:08:17,996 --> 00:08:19,998
Manager

84
00:08:19,998 --> 00:08:22,000
Manager Jiro has called me.

85
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,002
(Slap sounds) Manager!

86
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:28,006
Manager, yes

87
00:08:28,006 --> 00:08:31,006
Come on, yes yes yes yes please prepare

88
00:08:36,014 --> 00:08:40,014
(Aya) Hey Sabu-chan Where are you coming?

89
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:49,025
A little

90
00:09:19,991 --> 00:09:21,993
It's been a while Jiro-chan

91
00:09:21,993 --> 00:09:24,996
It was 3 o'clock, you're still the same

92
00:09:24,996 --> 00:09:26,998
Bad Bad

93
00:09:26,998 --> 00:09:31,002
Why did you send an email saying that the funeral and burial didn't come?

94
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:34,002
Can't go, why are you going?

95
00:09:37,008 --> 00:09:40,008
Come on this for you

96
00:09:45,016 --> 00:09:48,019
I don't need my father's bones

97
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:51,022
Anything like that is just a father

98
00:09:51,022 --> 00:09:54,025
(Aya) The cheeks are really soft

99
00:09:54,025 --> 00:09:57,028
Tw...

100
00:09:57,028 --> 00:10:01,032
Jiro-chan How much has he been thrilled by this guy?

101
00:10:01,032 --> 00:10:04,035
I guess I didn't forget

102
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:06,035
He's dead Saburo

103
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:11,042
He's dead

104
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:15,046
(Miki) Daichi, come over here

105
00:10:15,046 --> 00:10:19,050
It's more about his legacy

106
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:24,050
I want this land at Shimobashi to give it to me 3,200 tsubo.

107
00:10:26,057 --> 00:10:28,059
If there's something you want in the heritage

108
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:31,062
I don't mind if the others are given priority to inheritance.

109
00:10:31,062 --> 00:10:35,066
Only here is it really necessary for this job

110
00:10:35,066 --> 00:10:37,068
It's bad but...

111
00:10:37,068 --> 00:10:39,068
I don't need it

112
00:10:41,072 --> 00:10:44,072
I don't need that thing

113
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:49,080
Haa...

114
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,082
There are a lot of contracts and documents

115
00:10:51,082 --> 00:10:53,084
Well then, see you later

116
00:10:53,084 --> 00:10:59,090
Um... I'm Iida, a lawyer.

117
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:03,027
thank you

118
00:11:03,027 --> 00:11:06,030
Saburo

119
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,033
Come and eat at home once in a while

120
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:11,033
So I have work

121
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:24,048
(Aya) Ah

00:11:24,048 --> 00:11:28,052

144
00:15:39,036 --> 00:15:43,040
I would like to hear your opening greetings

145
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,043
Eh, please be quiet (citizens' heckling)

146
00:15:46,043 --> 00:15:50,047
(Moderator) Please be seated and quiet.

147
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:53,050
The meeting will never start (vibrators).

Eh, please be quiet

149
00:15:55,052 --> 00:15:58,055
There may be opinions for each of you.

150
00:15:58,055 --> 00:16:00,992
First, I would like to decide after discussing the matter.

151
00:16:00,992 --> 00:16:02,992
Please be quiet

152
00:16:23,014 --> 00:16:25,016
I wish I had entered first

153
00:16:25,016 --> 00:16:28,016
I told you because there's someone there after all

154
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:35,021
I didn't expect to come again so I felt nauseous

155

Who is it? you

163
00:18:34,011 --> 00:18:38,011
Kamito Saburo This is Jiro-chan

164
00:18:46,023 --> 00:18:48,023
Sorry for the inconvenience

170
00:19:17,988 --> 00:19:19,988
What...

171
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:31,001

177
00:20:01,031 --> 00:20:03,031

(Miki) What?

184
00:20:38,068 --> 00:20:41,071
(Iida) Notarized documents are official documents.

185
00:20:41,071 --> 00:20:44,074
It is highly binding as a suicide note

186
00:20:44,074 --> 00:20:47,077
I wonder if I'll be able to win even if I take it to court

187
00:20:47,077 --> 00:20:49,079
(Miki) No no

That's not going to be allowed, right?

00:20:55,085 --> 00:20:59,089
I'm a lawyer, so I'm somehow hiring him for another person.

192
00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:02,026
(Iida) But I met my dad during his lifetime.

193
00:21:02,026 --> 00:21:06,030
The names of the two are written

194
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,032
(Miki) Is she really a big brother?

195
00:21:08,032 --> 00:21:11,035
Well, I don't know what the face is

196
00:21:11,035 --> 00:21:14,038
Big Brother was when I was in fourth grade.

197
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:17,038
It's Ichiro (Miki) Why don't you know?

198
00:21:19,043 --> 00:21:23,047
When I was scarred, I was hit by my father

199
00:21:23,047 --> 00:21:25,049
(Miki) Haa...

200
00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:29,049
But, you still don't know, right? That's Ichiro's big brother

201
00:21:31,055 --> 00:21:35,059
(Iida) I'll go to that notary public office and check it out.

202

Hey…

372
00:38:41,017 --> 00:38:45,021
He's a patrol around the city, but (yen)

373
00:38:45,021 --> 00:38:48,024
There are people around here making a fuss in the middle of the night.

374
00:38:48,024 --> 00:38:50,026
There's a complaint

375
00:38:50,026 --> 00:38:54,030
(Coin) Huh? It's still 8 o'clock, isn't it?

376
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:56,032
Do you do this every day?

377
00:38:56,032 --> 00:38:59,969
Well, if it doesn't rain

378
00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:02,969
(Chinese)

379
00:39:06,976 --> 00:39:11,981
(Ube) Uh, you know, a high school girl was attacked around here last week.

380
00:39:11,981 --> 00:39:14,984
There are also complaints about people making a fuss outside and people saying they're scared.

381
00:39:14,984 --> 00:39:17,987
Do you know your position? Hey

382
00:39:17,987 --> 00:39:19,987
(Coin) What... What? position…

383
00:39:25,995 --> 00:39:28,998
(Ube) What? (Liu) Huh?

384
00:39:28,998 --> 00:39:30,998
(Nagamine) Please stay calm, please stay calm

385
00:39:34,003 --> 00:39:36,005
(Zen) Yes, you know (Nagamine) I understand.

386
00:39:36,005 --> 00:39:38,007
(Coin) Wait a second, wait a second

387
00:39:38,007 --> 00:39:42,011
You guys are working properly

388
00:39:42,011 --> 00:39:45,014
Yeah, I'm paying rent too

389
00:39:45,014 --> 00:39:51,014
It's fun to eat together like this at night

390
00:39:55,024 --> 00:39:57,026
(Changmine) Calm down, calm down (Liu) Huh?

391
00:39:57,026 --> 00:40:00,026
(Nagamine) No, I'm drinking too much (sigh)

392
00:40:02,031 --> 00:40:04,033
(Liu) Hey

393
00:40:04,033 --> 00:40:09,038
An illegal foreigner like you is the best

394
00:40:09,038 --> 00:40:13,042
(Vibilant) Hey! What are you doing? Stop it

395
00:40:13,042 --> 00:40:15,044
(Comment)

396
00:40:15,044 --> 00:40:20,044
(Shatter sound)

397
00:40:22,051 --> 00:40:26,055
(Riku-jin) Hey, damn Chinese! Everyone dies! Everyone dies!

398
00:40:26,055 --> 00:40:30,059
Everyone dies! Everyone dies! Hey, let's be Chinese!

399
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:33,062
Hey! Take it easy, take it easy!

400
00:40:33,062 --> 00:40:36,065
Let's go early

401
00:40:36,065 --> 00:40:41,065
(Chinese anger)

402
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:55,079
This caused a situation that blew the history of vigilantes into muddy.

403
00:40:58,087 --> 00:41:00,087
I'm very sorry

404
00:41:02,024 --> 00:41:05,027
Take responsibility for the leader...

405
00:41:05,027 --> 00:41:08,030
(Oizumi) Well, that's good

406
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:13,035
If they leave the Shimobashi, it's two birds with one stone

407
00:41:13,035 --> 00:41:17,039
Is there anything else to see? (Ube) Yes

408
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:19,041
(Oizumi) Write an article

409
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:22,044
The other side came out first

410
00:41:22,044 --> 00:41:24,046
(Secretary) Yes

411
00:41:24,046 --> 00:41:27,049
Ube-san, a bit

412
00:41:27,049 --> 00:41:30,052
(Oizumi) I need you guys to get stronger too

413
00:41:30,052 --> 00:41:34,056
Sorry I'm embarrassed to my ancestors

414
00:41:34,056 --> 00:41:38,060
(Oizumi) I'll call an acquaintance of Iruma, huh?

415
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:42,064
Let me train you?

416
00:41:42,064 --> 00:41:44,066
(Strait) Erlangjun

417
00:41:44,066 --> 00:41:46,066
Ah... yes

418
00:41:53,075 --> 00:41:58,080
What's going on with the land at Motobashi? inheritance

419
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:02,080
That's a bit... there's a problem

420
00:42:06,022 --> 00:42:08,022
I heard that my eldest son is back

421
00:42:10,026 --> 00:42:12,026
Sorry, um...

422
00:42:17,033 --> 00:42:21,037
My eldest son returned to the house and had a notarized certificate.

423
00:42:21,037 --> 00:42:24,040
What do you mean?

424
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,042
yes

425
00:42:26,042 --> 00:42:29,045
That's not good

426
00:42:29,045 --> 00:42:32,048
Can't you give it up?

427
00:42:32,048 --> 00:42:37,048
That's that kind of troublesome brother.

428
00:42:39,055 --> 00:42:41,057
What's your name?

429
00:42:41,057 --> 00:42:44,060
picture? Oldest son

430
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,060
Ah, it's Ichiro

431
00:43:03,012 --> 00:43:06,012
Ah, it's been a while

432
00:43:08,017 --> 00:43:11,017
(Sawaki) Yes... Yes

433
00:43:15,024 --> 00:43:20,029
Yes, I'll let someone find it

434
00:43:20,029 --> 00:43:23,029
Yes yes it's okay

435
00:43:26,035 --> 00:43:29,035
Yes Yes Hello

436
00:43:36,045 --> 00:43:39,048
(Peeing sound) (Osako) Yes

437
00:43:39,048 --> 00:43:44,053
Yes I understand, thank you very much

438
00:43:44,053 --> 00:43:49,053
Yes, I'm sorry

439
00:44:06,008 --> 00:44:08,010
(Choi) Yeah... I'll give you a dad! (Mochida) Oh

440
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:11,013
(Daijima)YoishoYishoHaha...

441
00:44:11,013 --> 00:44:15,017
(Mochida) Oh oh oh oh oh (Kajishima) Hey hahaha

442
00:44:15,017 --> 00:44:17,019
(Osako's spitting sound)

443
00:44:17,019 --> 00:44:19,021
(Daijima)Yay (Mochida)

444
00:44:19,021 --> 00:44:22,024
(Peach) Bamboo shoots I want to eat bamboo shoots

445
00:44:22,024 --> 00:44:24,026
(Teaked) Bamboo shoots? (Momo) Yes

446
00:44:24,026 --> 00:44:26,028
(Tell) Yes, is one okay? (Momo) Thank you

447
00:44:26,028 --> 00:44:28,030
So maybe I'll have some meat too

448
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:30,030
(Sakura) Thank you for the soup too (momo)

449
00:45:02,998 --> 00:45:04,998
Aya quits the store

450
00:45:28,023 --> 00:45:32,027
(Kanshi) Haa...

451
00:45:32,027 --> 00:45:35,027
(Sakura's sob)

452
00:45:37,032 --> 00:45:39,032
Eat it

453
00:45:47,042 --> 00:45:50,045
(Kanshi) Sorry, please give me oolong tea and a bottle of beer.

454
00:45:50,045 --> 00:45:52,045
(Shop clerk) Yes

455
00:45:57,052 --> 00:45:59,989
(Aya) It's fine, so take it with you

456
00:45:59,989 --> 00:46:02,989
Because it's not needed

457
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
thank you

458
00:46:25,014 --> 00:46:27,014
(Sakura) Ah... Aya-chan

459
00:47:14,997 --> 00:47:16,997
(ランチ)

460
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:30,010
Excuse me

461
00:47:33,015 --> 00:47:36,018
It's last month's worth

462
00:47:36,018 --> 00:47:39,018
(Osako) (Choi) Yes

463
00:47:43,025 --> 00:47:46,028
(Osako) Apparently one person has quit

464
00:47:46,028 --> 00:47:49,031
Why don't you report it?

465
00:47:49,031 --> 00:47:52,034
Sorry it was sudden

466
00:47:52,034 --> 00:47:54,034
Why did you quit?

467
00:47:56,038 --> 00:48:00,976
There's a bit of a boring problem

468
00:48:00,976 --> 00:48:03,979
(Osako) We've decided whether it's boring or not.

469
00:48:03,979 --> 00:48:05,981
Oh, do you know what it means to have a butt?

470
00:48:05,981 --> 00:48:07,981
Sorry, go away

471
00:48:11,987 --> 00:48:13,987
Haa...

472
00:48:16,992 --> 00:48:18,992
Hey

473
00:48:21,997 --> 00:48:23,997
Ah...

474
00:48:32,007 --> 00:48:38,013
Hey, my eldest son seems to be back

475
00:48:38,013 --> 00:48:41,016
Let the rights of Shimobashi be waived

476
00:48:41,016 --> 00:48:43,018
picture?

477
00:48:43,018 --> 00:48:46,021
(Osako) Even if you inherit... (Cheek Sakura) Sorry

478
00:48:46,021 --> 00:48:48,023
(Osako) Even if my second son inherits

479
00:48:48,023 --> 00:48:50,023
Either is fine

480
00:48:52,027 --> 00:48:54,029
I don't need to wear a towel

481
00:48:54,029 --> 00:48:57,032
(Sakura) Sorry, it's too...

482
00:48:57,032 --> 00:48:59,969
That kind of meaning...

483
00:48:59,969 --> 00:49:01,971
(Osako) Let's talk this week

484
00:49:01,971 --> 00:49:04,974
If I can't, I'll go straight to you

485
00:49:04,974 --> 00:49:06,976
Itte!

486
00:49:06,976 --> 00:49:08,978
(Sakura) Ah, sorry (Osako) tick

487
00:49:08,978 --> 00:49:11,981
Um... sorry

488
00:49:11,981 --> 00:49:15,985
Go it's this week

489
00:49:15,985 --> 00:49:17,985
There's no time!

490
00:49:25,995 --> 00:49:28,998
Hey, dirty ass, head over here

491
00:49:28,998 --> 00:49:33,002
(Sakura) Yes... It's...

492
00:49:33,002 --> 00:49:35,002
Hi...

493
00:49:38,007 --> 00:49:40,007
Ugh...

494
00:50:12,041 --> 00:50:14,041
(The sound of the door closing)

495
00:50:28,057 --> 00:50:30,057
(The sound of the car door closing)

496
00:50:32,061 --> 00:50:35,061
(Groaning)

497
00:50:48,077 --> 00:50:50,077
Who are they?

498
00:50:55,084 --> 00:50:58,084
Is it true that you have 400 million yen in debt?

499
00:51:04,026 --> 00:51:07,026
(Groaning)

500
00:51:20,042 --> 00:51:24,046
My woman who was pounded by you has quit

501
00:51:24,046 --> 00:51:26,046
Ha

502
00:51:31,053 --> 00:51:33,053
Hey

503
00:51:42,064 --> 00:51:47,069
Please let go of the land of Shimobashi that I was looking at the other day

504
00:51:47,069 --> 00:51:51,073
I'm fine, please give it to Jiro-chan

505
00:51:51,073 --> 00:51:54,076
Why isn't it?

506
00:51:54,076 --> 00:51:57,079
Anything

507
00:51:57,079 --> 00:52:01,016
The rest is good, but that's not good

508
00:52:01,016 --> 00:52:05,016
Hey wait a minute

509
00:52:08,023 --> 00:52:11,026
Hey!

510
00:52:11,026 --> 00:52:14,026
Wait a second!

511
00:52:18,033 --> 00:52:20,033
Hey!

512
00:52:26,041 --> 00:52:29,041
Wait a minute!

513
00:52:48,063 --> 00:52:51,063
Do you remember when I crossed here a long time ago?

514
00:52:59,074 --> 00:53:02,010
The day my mother died

515
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:06,014
You stabbed my father's neck

516
00:53:06,014 --> 00:53:08,014
The three of us went to fill in the knife.

517
00:53:11,019 --> 00:53:15,019
You know, "Scary, scary" doesn't pass at all

518
00:53:19,027 --> 00:53:26,034
Why did you leave and Jiro-chan leave?

519
00:53:26,034 --> 00:53:30,038
Because it's going to have a head

520
00:53:30,038 --> 00:53:35,038
Even in this shitty countryside, just looking at odds makes me feel headed

521
00:53:39,047 --> 00:53:43,051
If so, don't come back

522
00:53:43,051 --> 00:53:47,051
If you don't come back then nothing will change

523
00:53:50,058 --> 00:53:53,061
Even if you plunge into the hole in your ass, you don't have to plunge

524
00:53:53,061 --> 00:53:56,061
You know, nothing's going to change

525
00:54:00,002 --> 00:54:04,006
I thought I'd give you medical expenses with the inheritance.

526
00:54:04,006 --> 00:54:08,006
I don't need it anymore, huh

527
00:54:10,012 --> 00:54:12,012
a…

528
00:54:14,016 --> 00:54:16,016
Ah...

529
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:20,022
Haa...

530
00:54:20,022 --> 00:54:22,022
Hmm

531
00:54:24,026 --> 00:54:26,026
You!

532
00:54:29,031 --> 00:54:32,034
Ah!

533
00:54:32,034 --> 00:54:35,037
(Groaning)

534
00:54:35,037 --> 00:54:40,037
(Hard breathing)

535
00:54:44,046 --> 00:54:49,051
(laughter)

536
00:54:49,051 --> 00:54:53,051
(Strong voice)

537
00:55:03,999 --> 00:55:08,999
(Voices between Ichiro and Saburo)

538
00:55:24,019 --> 00:55:27,022
Come on, come

539
00:55:27,022 --> 00:55:29,024
Come on, come on!

540
00:55:29,024 --> 00:55:32,024
Hahaaaah!

541
00:55:34,029 --> 00:55:37,032
Hey! Hey! a little bit!

542
00:55:37,032 --> 00:55:39,034
You! Hey!

543
00:55:39,034 --> 00:55:42,037
Ah... stop it for a moment, I get it, I get it, stop it!

544
00:55:42,037 --> 00:55:46,041
Is my father's notarized certificate so frustrating?!

545
00:55:46,041 --> 00:55:50,045
Hey! Stop it for a moment, no good Saburo!

546
00:55:50,045 --> 00:55:52,047
(Hard breathing)

547
00:55:52,047 --> 00:55:56,051
Hey, go across, go across, go across

548
00:55:56,051 --> 00:55:58,053
No, what are you doing?

549
00:55:58,053 --> 00:56:01,990
Okay, ah, ah!

550
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:03,992
It's also yours!

551
00:56:03,992 --> 00:56:07,996
You know, you couldn't face anything, but what?

552
00:56:07,996 --> 00:56:10,999
I guess they couldn't protect anything, but hey!

553
00:56:10,999 --> 00:56:14,002
Stop it...

554
00:56:14,002 --> 00:56:16,004
Hey

555
00:56:16,004 --> 00:56:18,004
Stop it!

556
00:56:20,008 --> 00:56:24,012
Stop, I know I know

557
00:56:24,012 --> 00:56:28,016
Stop it... Ah! ah…

558
00:56:28,016 --> 00:56:31,019
Hey, it's painful, it's

559
00:56:31,019 --> 00:56:34,019
(Scream)

560
00:56:38,026 --> 00:56:40,026
Hmm

561
00:56:43,031 --> 00:56:45,033
Understood!

562
00:56:45,033 --> 00:56:48,036
Ah ah ah!

563
00:56:48,036 --> 00:56:50,036
Ah wow

564
00:56:53,041 --> 00:56:55,043
Ah

565
00:56:55,043 --> 00:56:59,047
(Koibuchi) Once you grab it, defeat it immediately!

566
00:56:59,047 --> 00:57:01,983
Faster!

567
00:57:01,983 --> 00:57:04,986
more!

568
00:57:04,986 --> 00:57:06,988
(Rikuto) Eeee!

569
00:57:06,988 --> 00:57:09,991
(Koibuchi) Oh, that's good

570
00:57:09,991 --> 00:57:11,993
(Rikujin) Thank you (Koibuchi) You guys, let's put in the special forces.

571
00:57:11,993 --> 00:57:15,997
Take the Ground Self-Defense Force, because the Ground Self-Defense Force is young, what?

572
00:57:15,997 --> 00:57:19,000
(Ono Rikuto) Thank you

573
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,002
(Riku-jin) Come

574
00:57:21,002 --> 00:57:23,004
(Amemiya) It's effective to destroy Self-Defense Force members.

575
00:57:23,004 --> 00:57:27,004
Apparently there's a dojo near Iruma Air Base.

576
00:57:31,012 --> 00:57:34,012
I'll take the 2nd squad today too.

577
00:57:37,018 --> 00:57:40,021
picture? Shimobashi area

578
00:57:40,021 --> 00:57:43,021
You should focus on turning, so you can get it from Professor Kishi

579
00:57:45,026 --> 00:57:47,026
Huh? Didn't you hear it?

580
00:57:51,032 --> 00:57:53,032
(Vibilants) Please

581
00:57:56,037 --> 00:57:58,037
(Amemiya) Yes, please

582
00:57:59,975 --> 00:58:01,975
Yes, thank you very much

583
00:58:03,979 --> 00:58:05,979
(Vibilants) I'm so motivated

584
00:58:07,983 --> 00:58:09,985
(cheek) I like to add lotion

585
00:58:09,985 --> 00:58:12,988
(Momo) Why do I have to do it?

586
00:58:12,988 --> 00:58:14,990
Help me

587
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:17,990
(cheek) No no no no no no no no no no no no no

588
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:30,000
(Sighing sound)

589
00:59:18,987 --> 00:59:23,987
(Vibilants' talk)

590
00:59:58,026 --> 01:00:00,028
(Rikuto) Ugh... Itte...

591
01:00:00,028 --> 01:00:02,030
Ha... Ha...

592
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:05,033
(Chinese)

593
01:00:05,033 --> 01:00:07,035
(Rikujin) Itte...

594
01:00:07,035 --> 01:00:10,038
(Vibilants) What's wrong? Hey, what's wrong?

595
01:00:10,038 --> 01:00:13,041
What's wrong, hey

596
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:17,045
(Ono) Hey hey!

597
01:00:17,045 --> 01:00:20,048
(Vibilant) It's bloody (Ono) Hey Rikuto! Hey!

598
01:00:20,048 --> 01:00:23,051
(Vibilants) What's wrong? Are you okay?

599
01:00:23,051 --> 01:00:25,053
This is crazy...

600
01:00:25,053 --> 01:00:28,056
What happened, hey (Rikujin) I got it, I got it...

601
01:00:28,056 --> 01:00:30,058
(Ono) Ambulance! (Vibilants) Are you okay?

602
01:00:30,058 --> 01:00:33,061
(Vibilants) Call the ambulance, it's dangerous, it's dangerous...

603
01:00:33,061 --> 01:00:38,061
(Vibilants' panicking voices)

604
01:00:40,068 --> 01:00:42,070
(Ono) Hey!

605
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:44,072
Wait!

606
01:00:44,072 --> 01:00:46,074
Hey wait!

607
01:00:46,074 --> 01:00:49,077
Wait!

608
01:00:49,077 --> 01:00:51,079
(Vibilants) Follow me, chase me

609
01:00:51,079 --> 01:00:53,081
(Ono) Wait!

610
01:00:53,081 --> 01:00:56,084
Wait!

611
01:00:56,084 --> 01:00:59,087
(Vibilant) Hey! (Ono) Wait!

612
01:00:59,087 --> 01:01:02,023
(Vigilante) Ono-kun Take care (Ono) Wait!

613
01:01:02,023 --> 01:01:04,023
(Vibilants) Wait, come on! (Vibilants) Better to stop the bleeding

614
01:01:24,045 --> 01:01:27,045
(Nurse) I'll come again when I finish

615
01:01:34,055 --> 01:01:36,055
forever?

616
01:01:38,059 --> 01:01:41,059
Ah I understand yes

617
01:01:44,065 --> 01:01:46,067
(Nakura) What did you think?

618
01:01:46,067 --> 01:01:49,070
(Reporter) It's a huge fuss

619
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:51,072
Even blindness

620
01:01:51,072 --> 01:01:54,072
(Nagamine) Ah... Is that so?

621
01:01:56,077 --> 01:01:59,080
Sorry, there's a parliament (Nakura) yes

622
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:01,015
(Nagamine)Thank you for your hard work

623
01:02:01,015 --> 01:02:03,017
(Reporter) It's a big stir

624
01:02:03,017 --> 01:02:09,023
(Protest group roars)

625
01:02:09,023 --> 01:02:11,025
(Chairman) 23 votes in favor

626
01:02:11,025 --> 01:02:13,027
(A rustling of pros and cons)

627
01:02:13,027 --> 01:02:15,027
(Chairman) 9 votes against

628
01:02:18,032 --> 01:02:22,036
As I just reported

629
01:02:22,036 --> 01:02:27,041
Proposal No. 1, with a majority vote

630
01:02:27,041 --> 01:02:32,046
In large-scale commercial facilities in the Shimobashi area

631
01:02:32,046 --> 01:02:36,050
The proposed land readjustment business plan is:

632
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:40,050
It was passed as proposed

633
01:02:42,056 --> 01:02:44,058
(Kishi)Thank you for your hard work Congratulations to Mr. (American)

634
01:02:44,058 --> 01:02:47,061
Congratulations (Kishi) Thank you for your hard work

635
01:02:47,061 --> 01:02:49,063
Oizumi-sensei

636
01:02:49,063 --> 01:02:51,065
Congratulations to you (Parliament) (Oizumi) Ah

637
01:02:51,065 --> 01:02:53,067
Congratulations to you (Parliamentarian)

638
01:02:53,067 --> 01:02:55,067
(Oizumi) Thank you, hard work

639
01:02:58,072 --> 01:03:00,008
(Male) Teacher came Teacher came

640
01:03:00,008 --> 01:03:02,010
(Male) Teacher Teacher! Congratulations (male)

641
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:06,010
Starting this weekend, a mall executive committee will be established with young people in the midst of the weekend

642
01:03:08,016 --> 01:03:12,020
Those who cannot inherit the land cannot enter

643
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:14,022
Do you understand?

644
01:03:14,022 --> 01:03:16,024
yes

645
01:03:16,024 --> 01:03:19,027
Foreign villages will be here

646
01:03:19,027 --> 01:03:22,030
You just have to do the ground!

647
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:24,032
Tw...

648
01:03:24,032 --> 01:03:28,036
If it were your dad, it would be easy

649
01:03:28,036 --> 01:03:30,038
yes

650
01:03:30,038 --> 01:03:33,038
I don't need incompetent people from my group.

651
01:03:35,043 --> 01:03:38,043
Yes (injection)

652
01:03:43,051 --> 01:04:00,051
(Voices of applause and encouragement)

653
01:04:10,011 --> 01:04:12,011
(Cough)

654
01:04:14,015 --> 01:04:16,015
(Miki) Don't make that kind of face

655
01:04:21,022 --> 01:04:23,022
I'll do something

656
01:04:27,028 --> 01:04:30,031
Hey Daichi Daddy, isn't it okay?

657
01:04:30,031 --> 01:04:32,033
(Daichi) Yes (Miki) Yes "Daddy, do your best"

658
01:04:32,033 --> 01:04:34,035
(Day) Daddy, do your best

659
01:04:34,035 --> 01:04:37,035
(Miki) Uuuuuu well done

660
01:04:45,046 --> 01:04:47,046
Hmm...

661
01:05:01,996 --> 01:05:05,996
Tw... hmmm...

662
01:05:11,005 --> 01:05:14,005
Why can't you give up on the land?

663
01:05:23,017 --> 01:05:27,021
Other lands are good, the moto bridge is bad

664
01:05:27,021 --> 01:05:29,021
Why is it?

665
01:05:33,027 --> 01:05:36,030
The old man who went to war over there

666
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:39,033
This is the first land I bought when I returned from Manchuria.

667
01:05:39,033 --> 01:05:42,033
With the money I picked up scraps of iron

668
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:50,039
There are good lands and bad lands to sell

669
01:05:55,049 --> 01:05:59,053
There are Chinese people living there?

670
01:05:59,053 --> 01:06:01,990
ah

671
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:03,990
It's been a long time

672
01:06:05,994 --> 01:06:09,998
Don't pay off your debts?

673
01:06:09,998 --> 01:06:15,003
The Yokohama number I came to the other day is collected.

674
01:06:15,003 --> 01:06:18,003
The yakuza are moving around this big approach too

675
01:06:25,013 --> 01:06:27,013
I won't sell there

676
01:06:29,017 --> 01:06:32,020
I don't know if it's a mall or something...

677
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:36,020
If you drive, you can find something like that in Kumagaya and Ota.

678
01:06:40,028 --> 01:06:43,028
Woo

679
01:06:45,033 --> 01:06:48,036
Understood

680
01:06:48,036 --> 01:06:50,036
The story of heritage is fine

681
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:55,040
There's something else I need to talk about

682
01:07:05,987 --> 01:07:07,987
Let's go out dinner together with Jiro and the three of us

683
01:07:12,994 --> 01:07:14,994
Hey

684
01:07:20,001 --> 01:07:22,003
ah

685
01:07:22,003 --> 01:07:24,003
That's right

686
01:07:50,031 --> 01:07:54,035
Can you go home today?

687
01:07:54,035 --> 01:07:56,035
Okay, go home

688
01:07:58,039 --> 01:08:00,039
quickly

689
01:08:01,976 --> 01:08:04,976
I'll go out to eat soon

690
01:08:11,986 --> 01:08:14,986
(Eleveter arrival sound)

691
01:08:32,006 --> 01:08:34,006
(Miki) Ah

692
01:08:36,010 --> 01:08:41,010
It's not very good, but this is a condolence from the vigilantes

693
01:08:43,017 --> 01:08:45,017
I'll leave it here

694
01:08:48,022 --> 01:08:54,028
Sorry, the culprit hasn't been caught yet

695
01:08:54,028 --> 01:08:56,030
Such a village

696
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:59,030
I hope it's gone soon

697
01:10:12,039 --> 01:10:15,042
(Choi)

698
01:10:15,042 --> 01:10:17,042
(Shop clerk) Excuse me

699
01:10:20,047 --> 01:10:22,047
welcome

700
01:10:29,056 --> 01:10:31,056
(Kaiseshima) Osako-san (Osako) Huh?

701
01:10:38,065 --> 01:10:44,065
I don't have any contact at all, are you okay?

702
01:10:48,075 --> 01:10:53,080
It's not possible after all, sorry

703
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:56,083
(Osako) Huh?

704
01:10:56,083 --> 01:11:01,022
Land matters I can't do it

705
01:11:01,022 --> 01:11:03,022
Sorry

706
01:11:05,026 --> 01:11:08,026
Do you know what you're talking about?

707
01:11:15,036 --> 01:11:19,040
I'm quitting the store already

708
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,040
Why is it?

709
01:11:25,046 --> 01:11:27,046
Sorry

710
01:11:31,052 --> 01:11:34,055
I'm not going to quit

711
01:11:34,055 --> 01:11:37,058
Monthly sales are also rising

712
01:11:37,058 --> 01:11:39,058
Hey

713
01:11:43,064 --> 01:11:46,067
I've already decided

714
01:11:46,067 --> 01:11:48,069
Sorry

715
01:11:48,069 --> 01:11:50,069
(Osako) Hey

716
01:11:53,074 --> 01:11:57,074
Who do you think he's been looking after you so far? This guy

717
01:12:01,015 --> 01:12:06,020
Thank you very much to Osako-san.

718
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:08,020
I've been able to continue working forever...

719
01:12:10,024 --> 01:12:13,027
Ah... haa...

720
01:12:13,027 --> 01:12:17,031
(Scream)

721
01:12:17,031 --> 01:12:20,031
(Groaning)

722
01:12:24,038 --> 01:12:26,040
Ah!

723
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:29,043
(Osako) That's a crap, this brat (sound of hitting chopsticks with an ashtray)

724
01:12:29,043 --> 01:12:33,047
(Osako) Hey hey! Does this guy hurt? Hey!

725
01:12:33,047 --> 01:12:36,050
Hey! Let's put it in a neat shape (scream)

726
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:38,052
This guy isn't enough!

727
01:12:38,052 --> 01:12:40,054
(Daijima) Osako-san... (Osako) Oh?

728
01:12:40,054 --> 01:12:42,056
(Daijima) Osako-san, a little... (Osako) What's going on?

729
01:12:42,056 --> 01:12:47,061
Hey, what's going on! Hey huh? This brat

730
01:12:47,061 --> 01:12:49,063
Hey this guy

731
01:12:49,063 --> 01:12:51,065
Hey, I won't finish it like this

732
01:12:51,065 --> 01:12:53,067
Hey, what's going on (Daijima) Osako-san...

01:36:11,998 --> 01:36:17,003
It's you, take off your shoes

922
01:36:17,003 --> 01:36:22,008

927
01:36:39,025 --> 01:36:41,025
(Cough)

928
01:36:59,979 --> 01:37:01,981

(Osako) I'm a creditor too, do it later

933
01:37:12,992 --> 01:37:16,996
No, we have a long history with him

934
01:37:16,996 --> 01:37:18,998
I'm coming from Yokohama

935
01:37:18,998 --> 01:37:21,000
(Osako) That's why

936
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:24,003

(Oizumi) Oh, I'm busy today.

947
01:38:12,985 --> 01:38:17,990
We are very grateful that many people have come to visit us.

948
01:38:17,990 --> 01:38:22,995
As you know, the other day the outlet mall plan was

949
01:38:22,995 --> 01:38:26,999
The city council passed the decision with a majority vote.

950
01:38:26,999 --> 01:38:32,004
First of all, to all of you who have given us strong support and cooperation.

951
01:38:32,004 --> 01:38:36,004
I would like to express my deep gratitude

952
01:38:40,012 --> 01:38:42,014

(Daijima) Let's do it, this guy

963
01:39:10,977 --> 01:39:15,977
(Voices entangled by the Jijima Islands)

964
01:39:24,991 --> 01:39:27,994
(Mochida) It's disgusting

965
01:39:27,994 --> 01:39:29,996
It's a place for women

966
01:39:29,996 --> 01:39:31,996
You can go

967
01:39:37,003 --> 01:39:40,006
(Kajijima)Hey... (Osako)We've already talked about it

968
01:39:40,006 --> 01:39:42,008
We'd be fine if only we could get Motobashi.

969
01:39:42,008 --> 01:39:45,011
Hey, collect documents

970
01:39:45,011 --> 01:39:47,011

971
01:40:01,027 --> 01:40:07,027
(Osako) Hey, write a letter quickly, I'll kidnap that woman.

972
01:40:12,038 --> 01:40:15,041
Take off your shoes

973

Oh my goodness, this guy I'll just say it messy and fill it up here

974
01:40:19,045 --> 01:40:21,047
Sorry, big brother... big brother

976
01:40:24,050 --> 01:40:26,052
(Mochida) Go!

977
01:40:26,052 --> 01:40:28,054
Hey, go!

978
01:40:28,054 --> 01:40:32,058
(Oizumi) Oh, so now, towards completion in the year after next

01:40:32,058 --> 01:40:37,063
An executive committee to promote this plan vigorously

980
01:40:37,063 --> 01:40:40,066
I would like to launch it here today

981
01:40:40,066 --> 01:40:45,071
We have selected a wide range of talent, from veterans to young people.

982
01:40:45,071 --> 01:40:49,075
I will take this opportunity to make an announcement

983
01:40:49,075 --> 01:40:54,080

987
01:41:28,047 --> 01:41:30,049
(Sakurai) Wow, damn it!

01:41:30,049 --> 01:41:33,052

I'm sorry (Osako)

1009
01:42:25,037 --> 01:42:28,037
Have you been saying something silly for a while now? Huh?

1010
01:42:32,044 --> 01:42:34,046
Come to the land of people and be proud

1011
01:42:34,046 --> 01:42:37,049
He'll say something he's licked a lot, fat

1012
01:42:37,049 --> 01:42:41,053
(Sakurai) I guess the smell is stinky, but (Osako) Isn't it fine?

1013
01:42:41,053 --> 01:42:43,055
Will you die at once? Fat

1019
01:43:10,015 --> 01:43:12,017
(Daijima) What are you doing? Here it is!

1022
01:43:23,028 --> 01:43:25,028

01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:40,040

1026
01:44:19,018 --> 01:44:24,018

Ah, sorry if it's not good

Something unexpected happened

1063
01:48:07,980 --> 01:48:12,985
Yes, the land is fine

1064
01:48:12,985 --> 01:48:17,990
