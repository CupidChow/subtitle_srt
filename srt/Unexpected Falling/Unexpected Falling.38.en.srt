It's inside my house.

The dumplings are ready.

177

Here come the dumplings.

178

Get some dumplings.

179
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,230
-Try it out.
-Nothing can taste better.

180
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,440
These are dumplings?

181
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,200
It's Qi's cooking.

182
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,000
We made these together.

183

[Ruan Zhenzhen]
This is dough drop soup.

you may call the police.

Who are you?

189
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,030
Shut up and listen.

190
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,590
Go to Ruan Zhenzhen's house,

191
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,910
find a tape, and trade it for her life.

192

Boss.

196
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:13,840
Should we take everything?

197
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,880
As many as you can.

198

Is the list in here?

199
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,150
Probably not.

200
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,790
Ruan Zhenzhen is stalling for time.

201
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,110
It will take some time

202
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,110
to pack up everything here.

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,910
actually captured Zhen?

205
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,590
Did you call Officer Chen?

206
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,710
Not yet.

207
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,000
You and Qi must come with me.

208

If anything happens,

209

who brought me here?

212
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,760
I thought he'd been blackmailing you.

213

Why is he working with you now?

214

Xia Xinliang and I

who he's working for?

218
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,150
I'll tell you.

219

He is working for this.

This is what you're after.

You don't have to use

225
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,280
a different number every time.

226
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:07,880
I'm not calling the police.

227
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,030
Where should we drop the bag?

228

Okay.

232

I'm headed for Changping Street.

233

Turn around.

234
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,060
Okay.

235

Don't try anything funny.

Otherwise, the deal is off.

Keep the engine on.

Don't let him escape.

Yes.

talk it out?

308

What is there to talk about?

Do I even have a choice?

I don't have a choice.
