00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,760
Zhenzhen,

4
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,830
I gave the phone to you

5
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,760
last Saturday.

6
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,910
Did you throw away its box?

7
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,680
No.

8
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,270
Can you take a look

9
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:52,870
and see

10
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,870
if it contains two gold bars?

11
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,310
Gold bars?

12
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:57,800
Hold on.

13
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,080
I'll go home and check it for you.

14
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,470
I didn't find any.

15
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,160
Look carefully.

16
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,110
I found them.

17
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,800
They were hidden deep inside the box.

18
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,110
What's going on?

19
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,440
My co-worker made a slip.

20
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:36,720
You see.

21
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,160
I can't go out because I'm busy.

22
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,000
I'll send my co-worker to retrieve them.

23
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,520
Put the gold bars and the phone

24
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,630
in the box the way they were

25
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,630
and hand it to them.

26
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,000
Su Wen, did anything happen?

27
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:47,630
Don't ask.

28
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,080
Just do what I tell you.

29
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,270
I can't talk anymore.

30
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,000
The meeting is about to start.

31
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:52,910
By the way,

32
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,110
call Gao Jun back.

33
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,830
Don't reject his kindness.

34
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,600
Thanks.

35
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,000
May I know

36
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,630
what Su Wen is busy with now?

37
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,360
There's a case

38
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,720
that Su Wen is helping to investigate.

39
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,110
I see.

40
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:20,790
But why can't I

41
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,640
get through her phone?

42
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,440
Thank you for your cooperation.

43
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,200
Goodbye.

(Hello,)

46
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,670
(the number you have dialed is switched off.)

47
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,230
Let's go.

48
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,510
(By the way,)

49
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,510
(call Gao Jun back.)

50
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,480
(Don't reject his kindness.)

51
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,390
Gao Jun, where are you?

52
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,880
What's the matter?

53
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,480
I need to see you.

54
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,000
Are you at the hotel?

55
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:39,880
If you are,

56
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,600
I'll come right away.

57
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,880
I'm not at the hotel.

58
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,830
I'm meeting a client outside.

59
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,830
You can tell me

60
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,880
over the phone.

61
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,350
I think Su Wen is in trouble.

62
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,760
Where are you?

63
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,270
I'll go there right away.

64
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,270
I'm at the hotel

65
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:52,880
where Su Wen is staying.

66
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,040
Zhenzhen, what happened?

67
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,040
Last Saturday,

68
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,830
the phone Su Wen gave me

69
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,640
had two gold bars

70
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,480
hidden in the box.

71
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,830
She was taken away out of a sudden today.

72
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,200
And her phone is switched off.

73
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:44,760
Let me do the talking.

74
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,040
Hello, sorry to disturb you.

75
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,000
We're Su Wen's friends.

76
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,510
We were supposed
to have dinner together tonight.

77
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,880
But we don't know

78
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,880
why we couldn't get in touch with her.

79
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,000
Even her phone is switched off.

80
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,760
That's why we come over and ask.

81
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,230
Well,

82
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,880
Su Wen

83
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,270
was transferred

84
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,200
to another inspection team.

85
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,270
She has returned to Guangzhou.

86
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,110
If you can't get through her phone,

87
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,600
I suppose it's her work ethic.

88
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:14,880
Excuse me, then.

89
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,040
You lied.

90
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,600
I saw

91
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,720
Su Wen being taken away.

92
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,830
Please come and talk inside.

93
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,520
Bribery?

94
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,280
That's impossible.

95
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,400
Su Wen would never

96
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,350
do something like this.

97
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:48,880
Someone reported it

98
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,030
to the National Supervisory Commission

99
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,590
and also provided relevant evidence.

100
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,520
Su Wen was taken away

101
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,350
to assist with further investigation.

102
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:58,760
Then...

103
00:08:59,400 --> 00:08:59,960
I'm sorry.

104
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,880
I can only tell you

105
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,670
this much.

106
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
Someone must have framed her.

107
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,080
Do you know how much

108
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,640
the gold bars weigh?

109
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,590
It's 50 grams each.

110
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,520
So it's 100 grams.

111
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,520
It happens to cross the 30,000 yuan threshold.

112
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,670
The motive is so obvious.

113
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,150
What motive?

114
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,840
If the bribery amount is above 30,000 yuan,

115
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,030
it meets the threshold to be considered

116
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,670
a bribe.

117
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,280
There's a chance to be sentenced to prison.

118
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,640
It looks like the conspirator

119
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,470
not only wants

120
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,520
to kick Su Wen out of the inspection team,

121
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,110
but he also wants to crush her

122
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,000
so that she can't save herself.

123
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,470
Qiu Zhijian must be behind this.

124
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,400
It all comes down

125
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,280
to Xu Youning.

126
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,910
They're scared Su Wen might find something.

127
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,760
You're right.

128
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:44,880
Where are you going?

129
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,150
I want to go to Guangzhou.

130
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,550
You may not be able to see her

131
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,440
if you go now.

132
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,590
I still have to go anyway.

133
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,280
I'll know after I go.

134
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,440
I'll go with you.

135
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,350
Take my car.

136
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,110
It belongs to my friend. My car broke down.

137
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,110
They could go

138
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,150
as far as to set Su Wen up.

139
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,400
What is it

140
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,520
that Qiu Zhijian and the rest are afraid of?

141
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,470
You're back.

142
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
-Hi, Yiyi.
-Hello, madam.

143
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,910
Did you finish school?

144
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,960
Yiyi,

145
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,590
where's your aunt?

146
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,400
My aunt is working overtime.

147
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,520
Yiyi,

148
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,400
I have something to ask you.

149
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,710
Look at this.

150
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,880
Is the guy in the photo

151
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,520
your aunt's boyfriend?

152
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:02,590
Madam,

153
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,440
do you know Mr. Tan too?

154
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,200
Mr. Tan?

155
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,280
Yes, I know.

156
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,550
Madam,

157
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,030
who's this woman

158
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,710
next to him?

159
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,910
I don't know her.

160
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,030
Go ahead and play now.

161
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,230
Her phone is still switched off.

162
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,320
Why don't we tell

163
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,150
Su Wen's family

164
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,960
about what happened?

165
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,350
Maybe it could be of some help.

166
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,640
Her parents had divorced a long time ago.

167
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,000
They're overseas all these years.

168
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,640
Even if we let them know,

169
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,470
they might not be able to return in time.

170
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,080
But there's someone

171
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,910
who might be able to help.

172
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,470
Who?

173
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,470
