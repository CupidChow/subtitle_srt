00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,300
Something valuable.

344
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,250
If you stick it on you,

345
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,370
you'll feel warm right away.

346
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,130
Do you have more?

347
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:27,850
I asked if you have more of this.

348
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,660
It only generates heat for a limited time.

349
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,370
After that, it'll stop generating heat.

350
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:39,940
But I have a lot in my car.

351
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,370
We can take them from there later.

352
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,450
Are you sure Lu Yang will come?

353
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,090
Yes, he'll come.

354
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,130
Since you insist,

355
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,580
you'll keep watch, then.

356
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,180
I'll take a nap.

357
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,700
Wake me up if anything happens.

358
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,300
Okay, go to sleep.

359
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:09,940
Are you trying to scare me to death?

360
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,540
I thought you were fearless.

361
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,660
Did you hear that scream?

362
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:19,970
I saw

363
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,090
a figure heading that way.

364
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,300
Wait here.

365
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,330
I'll go and take a look.

366
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,610
I'm too scared to be here alone.

367
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,090
Just stay here and don't go anywhere.

368
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:05,170
Is it Lu Yang?

369
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:05,700
Yes.

370
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:06,770
What happened?

371
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,010
He had a head injury.

372
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,130
I think someone attacked him

373
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,130
from behind.

374
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:11,620
He's still alive.

375
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:15,060
Did you see the guy

376
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:15,770
who went that way?

377
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:16,530
No.

378
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:20,290
We must call an ambulance.

379
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:21,940
You can't call the police.

380
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,130
Why not?

381
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,530
I'll explain it to you later.

382
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,490
Stop. If we leave now,

383
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,490
Lu Yang might

384
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:31,060
die here.

385
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,410
If you call the police,

386
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,340
what are you going to tell the police?

387
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:35,220
I'll answer them honestly.

388
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:36,490
If the police ask

389
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:37,740
how you found the victim?

390
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:38,650
Why are you here

391
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,770
in the middle of the night?

392
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,220
Did you ask to see the victim here?

393
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,740
Why did you want to see him?

394
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,460
How would you answer?

395
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,890
I'll explain it to the police.

396
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:48,820
What are you going to say?

397
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:50,700
Both of us

398
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:52,580
will be the first suspects

399
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,060
of this murder.

400
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,130
The police won't falsely accuse
innocent people.

401
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:57,820
Even if they don't,

402

what about the rest?

403
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:00,650
Lu Yang's family.

404
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,130
Your friends and family.

405
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,340
What would they think of you?

406
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,620
Have you forgotten

407

what Xu Youning's death

408

has brought to you?

I'm sure you understand

410
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:17,620
how fearful gossip is

411
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,690
more than I do.

I'll call the police.

When the police arrive,

00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,340
I won't mention your name

418

Who attacked Lu Yang?

443
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,930
Have you caught that culprit?

444
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:50,860
We're still

445
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,860
investigating this case.

446
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:52,930
There are some things

447
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,450
we need to ask you.

448

00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:57,820
Sure.

450
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:01,450
Why don't we step aside?

451

who had a beef with Lu Yang?

455

I've never heard of anything like that.

456
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,100
Lu Yang

457
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,930
is gentle and conscientious.

458
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:23,210

with good performance.

460
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:27,180
I never heard of him having

461
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,450
any dispute with anyone.

462
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,450

I never saw him
