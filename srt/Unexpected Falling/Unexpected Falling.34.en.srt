[Episode 34]

3
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,550
What's wrong?

4
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,270
Whose dependents are you?

5
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:20,600
Patient in bed 12.

6
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,030
Visiting hours are over.

7
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,550
The visitors can't stay here.

8
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,360
You should leave.

9
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,600
Okay.

10
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,830
What happened?

11
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,080
It doesn't feel right.

12
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,030
Lu Yang's father has left.

13
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,190
Who will accompany him tonight?

14
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,670
The accompanying chair has been opened.

15
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,360
Someone must be staying with him tonight.

16
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,190
Visiting hours are already over.

17
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,240
No one is allowed to enter the ward.

18
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,670
I guess something is wrong

19
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,270
with the person

20
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,030
who looks familiar to you.

21
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,270
Am I being too sensitive?

22
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,830
Why are you still here?

23
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,800
We're leaving.

24
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,190
I'm sorry.

25
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,000
Let's go.

26
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,510
(They already have their eyes on you.)

27
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,550
This is not the right time to talk about money.

28
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,320
What matters is your safety.

29
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,200
Rest assured,

30
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,880
I'll make sure you get the money.

31
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,200
(Sorry,)

32
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,670
(the number you dialed)

33
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,880
(can't be reached for the moment,)

34
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,390
(please try later.)

35
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,320
I still can't reach him.

36
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,000
It's normal.

37
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I guess he's thrown the card away.

38
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,790
Who might this be?

39
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,320
Could he be the one

40
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,390
who sent me the photos?

41
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,950
Let's not think about something

42
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,880
you can't figure out.

43
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,230
Just put it aside for now.

44
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,790
Think about something else.

45
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,550
To refresh your mind.

46
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,480
What's wrong?

47
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,670
The person who passed by,

48
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,070
could he be

49
00:06:59,070 --> 00:06:59,760
Lu Yang's relative?

50
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,230
He recognized us.

51
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,880
That's why he didn't enter the room.

52
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,200
How could he

53
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,070
know us?

54
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,480
Can you give it a break?

55
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,350
Won't your brain get tired?

56
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,350
It's cold, isn't it?

57
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,640
Not at all.

58
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,670
Let's talk about something else.

59
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,790
Like what?

60
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,510
Do you usually have much contact with Su Wen

61
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,270
when she works in Guangzhou?

62
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,550
Why are you interested

63
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,600
in Su Wen all of a sudden?

64
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,830
No.

65
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,440
I'm only interested in you.

66
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,280
Just get to the point.

67
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,590
Don't beat around the bush.

68
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,250
[Officer Chen]

69
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,280
It's still early.

70
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,710
Let's go see Lu Yang later.

71
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,710
Hello?

72
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,440
Hello.

73
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,200
Tan Shen,

74
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,880
do you have a minute?

75
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,080
How's Lu Yang doing?

76
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,960
What are you doing?

77
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,350
This is the additional medicine
prescribed by the doctor.

78
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,030
No, you're not a doctor.

79
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:34,760
Stop it.

80
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,200
Someone, help!

81
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,840
Someone, please!

82
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,030
There's a killer here!

83
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,880
Ruan Zhenzhen!

84
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,400
Gang?

85
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,520
Zhenzhen.

86
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,640
Does it hurt?

87
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:15,670
Let's go

88
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,470
have your wound dressed.

89
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,760
Zhenzhen,

90
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,400
are you alright?

91
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:20,960
I'm fine.

92
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,200
You...

93
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,200
Can you...

94
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,640
You really are a macho man.

95
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,840
Hello, Mr. Attorney.

96
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,880
Why are you here?

97
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,200
We are here

98
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,150
to see the doctor.

99
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,080
-Come on.
-Come on.

100
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,640
Let's go

101
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,550
have your wound dressed.

102
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,760
It's alright, Zhenzhen.

103
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,910
It's just a flesh wound.

104
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,470
I'll just put some iodine on it.

105
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,200
It still works.

106
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,230
It's not broken.

107
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,000
We can still use it.

108
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,440
Where are you going?

109
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,320
Well.

110
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,470
Gang, the motorcycle is fine.

111
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,150
It still works.

112
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,230
I think

113
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,550
we should leave now.

114
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,640
If you go home late,

115
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,670
your mother-in-law will scold you.

116
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,640
Zhenzhen,

117
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,470
I'll get going.

118
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,880
Let's go.

119
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,350
Zhenzhen.

120
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,470
Watch out for yourself.

121
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,230
Sit tight.

122
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,960
Off we go!

123
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,520
We'll get going.

124
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,400
Keep up, Piku!

125
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,470
Coming, coming!

126
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,590
What's wrong? Are you alright?

127
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,520
I'm fine. He hurt my back.

128
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,960
What happened just now?

129
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,640
Someone was trying to harm Lu Yang.

130
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,550
And I chased after him.

131
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,030
That's very bold of you.

132
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,470
How could you chase after him alone?

133
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,760
Do you know

134
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,350
how dangerous that was?

135
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,960
What if I didn't make it here?

136
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,350
You didn't make it here in time.

137
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:38,840
Sorry.

138
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,440
You don't have to apologize.

139
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,590
I'm not blaming you.

140
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,550
I didn't expect this

141
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,350
to happen either.

142
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,910
Tan Shen,

143
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,080
I really don't blame you.

144
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,280
If anyone is to blame,

145
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,000
it's me.

146
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,880
You're right.

147
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,110
I shouldn't

148
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,230
have gone after him alone.

149
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,840
If Gang didn't happen to be here

150
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,760
and saved me,

151
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,000
I would be either dead

152
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,440
or severely injured.

153
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,520
But you have nothing

154
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,760
to do with all of this.

155
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,030
This is not your fault.

156
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,400
I was too reckless.

157
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,470
Ruan Zhenzhen,

158
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,380
what do you mean by this?

159
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,550
I mean,

160
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,790
I don't blame you for this.

161
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,670
I'm not throwing a tantrum.

162
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,380
We're partners.

163
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,500
We're equal.

164
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,110
You have no obligation to protect me.

165
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,430
And I won't entrust my safety

166
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,060
to anyone else.

167
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,500
So you don't have to blame yourself.

168
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,110
Let's go and check on Lu Yang.

169
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,110
You're really infuriating.

170
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,350
I'm not.

171
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,470
What?

172
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,620
Are all the men like this?

173
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,070
When we women are being emotional,

When I reason with you,

you blame me for being cool and ruthless.

You're not Lu Yang.

You're misleading us.

Of course not.

It's too easy to deceive

Qiu Zhijian, that idiot.

I called him twice.

And he thought that I was Lu Yang.

223
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,790
Why did you want to kill Lu Yang?

224
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,980
I didn't.

225
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,070
Weren't you the ones who wanted to kill Lu Yang?

226

You wanted to use us to kill him?

put himself in disguise?

235
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,830
Idiot.

236
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,030
How could it be Lu Yang?

237
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,790
Lu Yang is being

surrounded by a bunch of police.

239

I don't have money.

Is it necessary for us to stay so far away?

257

Would those guys

come to my house and kill me?

259

So you went after him alone.

00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,670
What about the baby?

345
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,220
What will we do with the baby if we get divorced?

346
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,310
Don't worry about the baby.

347
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:42,830
It's been hard on me

348
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:43,910
to carry him for nine months.

349
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,550
So I'll give birth to him.

350
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,500
As I could give birth to him,

351
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,910
I'm sure I can do well in raising him.

352
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,670
I've done you wrong.

353
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,460
Can you stop talking

354
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,670
such nonsense?

355
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,790
Can you wait a little longer?

356
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,100
I mean

357
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,100
if we get divorced now,

358
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:23,220
you'll have

359
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,710
to bear part of my debt.

360
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,070
Give me some more time.

361
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,140
Let me pay off the debt.

362
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,070
Pay off the debt?

363
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:38,500
With what?

364
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,740
Getting drunk and picking a fight?

365
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:42,500
No.

366
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,550
Go away.

367
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,500
Did you get into a fight again?

368
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,190
I didn't.

369
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,670
What happened to your arm, then?

370
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:58,430
Nothing.

371
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,310
Let me take a look!

372
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:05,550
It's alright.

373
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,260
Let me see!

374
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:07,670
I want to see it!

375
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:15,310
Why are you still lying to me?

376
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,380
Yu. Yu.

377
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:31,190
Yu.

378
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:31,980
Yu, listen to me.

379
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,830
It wasn't a fight.

380
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,830
I didn't get into a fight.

381
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,860
I didn't get injured in a fight.

382
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,340
I fell down while rescuing Zhenzhen.

383
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,260
Rescuing Zhenzhen?

384
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,300
Yes.

385
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:46,830
Someone was trying to hurt her.

386
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,350
Someone was trying to run over her
with a motorcycle.

387
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,500
I had no choice as it was an emergency.

388
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,590
So I rode my e-bike

389
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,380
and hit

390
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:52,950
the motorbike.

391
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,300
Then, I fell and injured my arm.

392
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,180
Who was trying to hurt her?

393
00:32:59,180 --> 00:32:59,990
I have no idea.

394
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,660
Yu,

395
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,350
just stay out of this, will you?

396
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:07,950
Don't get me wrong again.

397
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:08,630
There's nothing

398
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:09,710
between me and Zhenzhen.

399
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,750
I was depraved back then.

400
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,470
What I did was too wicked.

401
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:14,660
So I always wanted to help her.

402
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,370
So that I can make up for my mistakes.

403
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,180
Besides,

404
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,540
someone was trying to abduct Zhenzhen.

405
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,380
An abduction.

406
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,630
Abduct her?

407
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,230
You Gang,

408
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,630
are you even a man?

409
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,020
You leave

410
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,990
your wife and kid alone.

411
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,300
Why do you care so much

412
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,230
about the other woman?

413
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,590
What did Ruan Zhenzhen

414
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,710
do to you?

415
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,140
You're completely obsessed with her,

416
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,660
aren't you?

417
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:39,710
Mom,

418
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,420
do you know what you're saying?

419
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,230
I'm telling the truth.

420
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,230
What else could it be?

421
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:44,780
This is between me and Gang.

422
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,990
You stay out of it.

423
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,470
Stay out of it?

424
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,660
If I do,

425
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,750
you've long been fooled by them.

426
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:50,750
If you stayed out of it,

427
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,500
both of us wouldn't have

428
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,660
come to this point.

429
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:02,780
Mom,

430
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:03,900
Yu is bad-tempered

431
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,470
as she's pregnant.

432
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:04,950
Don't mind her.

433
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:05,950
You have no say here!

434
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,590
Shi Shengyu,

435
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,500
I dare you to repeat

436
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,260
what you said just now.

437
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:32,980
Mom,

438
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,300
I really appreciate what you've done for me.

439
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:39,940
But I'm a grown-up.

440
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,020
Please,

441
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,540
I beg of you, okay?

442
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,260
Please let go.

443
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,150
Let me live the life

444
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:46,870
I desire.

445
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,590
Just leave me alone!

446
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,350
You want to live the life you desire?

447
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,630
You want to spend the rest of your life

448
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,540
with this loser, right?

449
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,070
Don't say that!

450
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,260
He's my husband,

451
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,780
the father of my kid.

452
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,300
I hear you.

453
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,830
I hear you clearly.

454
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,630
You're going to abandon

455
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,500
your mother for his sake, aren't you?

456
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:33,460
Yes.

457
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,630
I'm abandoning you for his sake.

458
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,670
Go back to your hometown!

459
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,590
Anyway, we always argue

460
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,700
when you're here.

461
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,500
You always cause trouble for me!

462
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,590
Yu. Yu.

463
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,350
Mom. Mom.

464
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,390
Yu said that out of pique.

465
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,460
She didn't mean it.

466
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,220
Mom, don't...

467
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,190
Get lost!

468
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,220
[Gao Jun, Partner Lawyer]

469
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,370
[Secretary Chen]

470
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,260
Hello?

471
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:04,910
Gao,

472
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:06,590
do you have a minute?

473
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,500
Yes, I'm all ears.

474
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,430
Here's the thing.

475
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,780
Xu's incident was not

476
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:16,870
that serious.

477
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:18,870
Why did it end up

478
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:19,500
like this?

479
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:23,670
It should be settled

480
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,670
once the person is dead.

481
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,460
How could you

482
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,630
let a small matter

483
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,540
develop into a big case?

484
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,540
This is inexplicable.

485
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,190
Attorney Gao.

486
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:36,740
Secretary Chen,

487
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:37,980
I've been working hard

488
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,350
to make up for this matter.

489
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,460
It doesn't matter

490
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,070
what

491
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,260
or how you do it.

492
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,740
What matters is the outcome.

493
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,020
To be honest with you.

494
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,670
Boss has called into question

495
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,700
your capability.

496
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,940
If this goes on,

497
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,870
even I can't protect you.

498
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,830
I can assure you and Boss.

499
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:05,980
That this time,

500
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,020
I'll be sure to settle this

501
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,150
and remove all the possibilities

502
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,670
that could make it worse.

503
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,590
There's not much time left for you.

504
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,070
Don't let Boss down.

505
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,630
Okay, I understand.

506
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,390
Hello, get me a car.

507
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:05,780
What's wrong, Yu?

508
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:24,260
Calm down, Yu.

509
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,590
It's not long since our mom left.

510
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,460
She won't get far.

511
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,630
I'll go get her back now.

512
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:28,940
Don't go.

513
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:46,980
Sorry.

514
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,220
