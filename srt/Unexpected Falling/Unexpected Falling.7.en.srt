132
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,910
Say something!

133
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,840

134

What a disgrace!

138
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,710
She even brought her kept man to the grave.

139
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,110
Are you trying to make it worse?

140
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,550
My poor son.

141
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,000
Move aside!

142

Yu.

144

Aren't you going to explain yourselves?

145
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,320
Are you okay?

146
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,440
Have you got what you wanted?

147
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,080
What do you mean?

148
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,150
Isn't this you taking your revenge?

149
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,790
I don't know what you're talking about.

150
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,640
Oh, you know it.

151
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,590
You know it very well.

152
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,710
I don't.

153
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,230
You came back

154
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,350
to visit your high school teacher

155
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,470
for no reason.

156
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,000
Then you dragged me to show me around the school.

157
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,000
You already left in the morning.

158
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:48,960
Yet, you came back

159
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,400
to pay respect to a high school schoolmate

160
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,200
you hadn't contacted for many years.

161
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,640
Gao Jun, tell me.

162
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,230
What are you up to?

163
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,080
Didn't you do

164
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,640
all these

165
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,840
to stage that sight

166
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,640
just now?

167
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,670
I know you're in a bad mood now.

168
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,590
Stop using my mood

169
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,320
as your excuse.

170
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,000
Why won't you admit

171
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,030
what you did?

172
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,080
What should I admit?

173
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:27,910

Yes.

Could it be Xu Youning?

397
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,220
Only Xu Youning and I had access

bring up the love letter

out of blue?

414

Yan contacted him, right?

415
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,830
How did Yan find him?

416
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,860
They were schoolmates.

So they've always been keeping in touch.

because I was too worried at the time.

00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,340
So I told him

424
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:34,910
that he must

425
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:35,980
find a capable lawyer.

426
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,500
