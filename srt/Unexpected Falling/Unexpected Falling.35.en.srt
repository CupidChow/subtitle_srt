so he sent me.

251

I heard the relative

252

253
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,030
called someone to ask for money.

Where are you?

348

I went out to get something done.

What do you have to do?

350

Tell me where you are now.

You have things that you don't want to share,

354
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,260
and so do I.

355
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,310
I'll hang up now.

356

We'll talk when I'm back.

357

If you call me again,

So much has happened.

361
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,030
It's impossible

362
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,310
that the police don't notice.

363
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,670
They must be keeping it really well

364

and have been investigating.

from somewhere else.

367
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,500
There's even a firewall.

368
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,590
Ridiculous.

369

Tell me,

370
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,590
is there any firewall in this world

371
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,790
that can withstand police investigation?

372
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:54,860
Let me tell you,

373
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:55,460
it's a matter of time

374
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,430
before they find you.

375
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,030
Even if they find me,

376
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,340
they'll still need time, no?

377
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,550
When the police got the evidence

378
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,710
and come to make the arrest,

379
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,830

380

left and gone overseas.

381
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,460
Why did Su Wen go to the firm

382

early in the morning to get the documents?

383

Don't you understand?

384
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,740
She's trying to trap you.

390

there will be no escape for us.

391
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,590
If so,

392
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,260
let's go the whole hog

393
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,260
and get rid of all the troublesome people.

394
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,620

395

get rid of him too.

396

is the root.

398

I've asked to meet her later.

399
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,500
Instead of trying to stop the boiling water,

400
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,260
let's take drastic action.

401

402
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,220
I will be careful.

look like a double-agent

such a secluded place.

412

It's so hard to find.

I'm afraid that they are watching you.

They won't do that.

forgot it in the car?

685
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,730
So I went to search for it.

686
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,910
And I really found it.

687
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:15,830
You're lying.

688
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,500
The police said

689
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:21,220
they found the key pouch

690
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,190
in your car,

691
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,110
and you passed out in the impound yard.

692
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,460
I found the key pouch

693
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,980
and was about to leave.

694
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,910
But I then realized that I lost my phone,

695
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,260
so I had to go back to look for it.

696
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,500
I accidentally tripped over

697
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,220
and hit my head.

698
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,300
Do you know

699
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,020
who called the ambulance for you?
