I've never

341
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:23,970
received your love letter

342
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:25,730
nor would I paste it

343
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:26,820
on the noticeboard.

344
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,180
What's with that scoff?

345
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,970
Putting a love letter that was written

346
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:36,780
by someone sincerely

347
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,820
on the noticeboard is outrageous.

348
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,090
Whether I like that person or not,

349
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,180
I'd never

350
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,730
humiliate someone like that.

351
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,180
Let's say I took you wrong.

352
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:50,970
My apologies.

353
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:52,820
I need to return to Beiling.

354
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,420
Let's part ways here.

355
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:00,090
How did you come here?

356
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,940
Traffic restrictions
are imposed in Beiling today.

357
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,300
I took the high-speed train here.

358
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,730
Let me drive you to the station.

359
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,370
No need. There's a cab coming.

360
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:18,580
See you.

361
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:20,300
See you.

362
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:47,820
It's moving.

363
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:49,090
Where is she?

364
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:49,940
Here.

365
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,580
What took you so long?

366
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,900
Did you really visit the old school with her

367
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,090
to recall our youth?

368
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:57,820
I wanted to provoke her

369
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,970
and throw her off the trail

370
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,370
with the love letter.

371
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:02,450
But it seems that she wasn't the one
who did that.

372
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,540
Did you get the picture?

373
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:05,540
Yes.

374
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,090
I've sent it

375
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,020
to Xu Youning's cousin already.

376
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,900
What do we do next?

377
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,700
Do we have to continue with the following plan?

378
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,420
We do. Be quick.

379
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,200
Don't let the chance slip by.

380
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:19,580
Mr. Attorney.

381
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:21,060
Don't you think

382
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,370
you're too cruel?

383
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,020
She's back.

384
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,250
Quick.

385
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:15,490
Hello.

386
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,610
I arrived at the station.

387
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:17,700
I called to let you know.

388
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:18,780
Where are you?

389
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,540
Have you reached home?

390
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,580
I just arrived.

391
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,780
Why are you talking so softly?

392
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:24,660
What has happened?

393
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,370
Someone was tailing me just now.

394
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:29,780
Tailing you?

395
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,180
It fine. I've already gotten rid of him.

396
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:07,370
Hello.

397
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,700
You're at the old apartment, right?

398
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,850
I'm outside.

399
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,730
I knocked on the door just now. Open the door.

400
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,370
What brings you here?

401
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,660
Come on in.

402
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:01,820
Come on in.

403
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:02,900
Sorry, the place is a bit bleak.

404
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:09,970
Why didn't you call me

405
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:11,580
since you're so scared?

406
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,540
I'm not scared.

407
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:17,330
You're not?

408
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,900
Then why didn't you turn on the light?

409
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,180
How did you know I was staying here?

410
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,700
You used to live here

411
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,940
when you were young, didn't you?

412
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,060
What has happened today?

413
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,180
Who was following you?

414
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:39,900
I have no idea.

415
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:42,490
Perhaps the creditor

416
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:43,540
sent someone here.

417
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:44,970
I don't know

418
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:45,850
what they want.

419
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,820
Are you going back to Beiling

420
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,610
tonight?

421
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,660
Look at this time now.

422
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,660
I'll miss the last train.

423
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,730
I can't go back.

424
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,330
Where are you staying tonight?

425
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,660
I can book a hotel for you.

426
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:17,580
Judging the situation now,

427
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,660
I'll stay here with you.

428
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,660
That's inappropriate though.

429
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,780
You only have two options now.

430
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:27,580
It's either I stay here with you

431
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:28,610
or

432
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,370
both of us

433
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:30,370
spend the night somewhere else.

434
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,020
This place is small

435
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,250
and we might run into someone.

436
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:36,900
That will be more inappropriate, right?

437
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,100
Fine.

438
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,940
Even though we call him our boss,

439
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,170
however, he's an outsider.

440
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:05,740
He hired us just for work

441
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,700
and he's not on the same side as us.

442
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,580
Get it?

443
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,220
Got it.

444
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,290
I don't think

445
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:16,820
it's necessary

446
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,490
to stay here anymore.

447
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,620
It's late now.

448
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,820
She won't come out again.

449
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,700
We should

450
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,370
just go

451
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,700
and come back tomorrow morning.

452
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:27,700
Can we actually do that?

453
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:30,940
Listen to me.

454
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,520
Nothing will go wrong.

455
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,170
Let's leave.

456
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,220
Turn on the air conditioner.

457
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,740
I can't stand the cold.

458
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,940
You didn't paste the love letter

459
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,650
on the noticeboard,

460
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:05,700
right?

461
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:13,970
I didn't.

462
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:17,290
Who has seen that letter

463
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,930
except you?

464
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:21,210
I don't know.

465
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,140
You were

466
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,860
seeing Xu Youning

467
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,340
around that time, right?

468
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:42,290
Good night.

469
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:58,860
Dude.

470
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:00,730
You woke up quite early, didn't you?

471
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,140
Do I look good in this?

472
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,690
Apply your lipstick too.

473
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:45,420
The one I bought you.

474
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,060
Will it look heavy on me?

475
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:56,490
No.

476
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,010
Let me have a look.

477
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:08,100
I like it.

478
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,450
Good, you like it.

479
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,860
Is she going out?

480
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,680
Well, I'm going to go my own way

481
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,930
and search her apartment today.

482
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:34,820
Otherwise,

483
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,340
we can never accomplish this task.

484
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,140
Do keep watch well.

485
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:01,100
Don't let Ruan Zhenzhen

486
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:01,930
find me in her apartment.

487
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,290
Rest assured, Jiu.

488
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,900
Why is it not moving?

489
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:01,660
I'm sorry.

490
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:02,770
Did you get hurt?

491
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,660
I'm so sorry, young lady.

492
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,140
I'm to be blamed.

493
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,690
Are you alright?

494
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:12,180
Do you need to go to the hospital?

495
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,140
I'm fine.

496
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:15,380
What a relief.

497
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,050
Glad to know that you're fine.

498
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,420
What do we do now?

499
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:19,010
We're busy, right?

500
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,490
And this place is far from downtown.

501
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:21,770
It'll take some time

502
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:22,450
to wait for the traffic police.

503
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,660
Can we settle this between us?

504
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,690
Is that okay?

505
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,060
The bumper is made of plastic.

506
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,420
Perhaps the bracket inside is broken.

507
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,100
As for the outer surface, it just needs

508
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:45,690
some touch-up paint.

509
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:47,420
What about this?
