00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,040
I respect you.

00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,510
I've been meaning

I'm not cut out for this job.

23
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,520

Bro.

29

I have to tell you something.

30
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,160
I've been meaning to do so.

31

I am just

32

Hello?

36
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:10,880
But, bro!

37
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,360
This job, I...

38

how I work, don't you?

43
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,190

45

I can't do something bad for real.

46
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,240
Besides,

47
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,880
Ruan Zhenzhen is surrounded by people.

48
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,440
He doesn't have an opening.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,830
What?

50
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,190
That's abduction.

51
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,440
It's

52
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,800
a serious offense.

53
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,600
If it did me in,

54
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,550
10 years, 20 years of jail,

55
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,720

56

It's my life.

57
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,000
We'll see.

58
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,830
When did you come back?

59
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,830
Why didn't you call me?

60
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,510
Let's talk inside.

61
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,480
Come on.

62
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,350
You freaked me out.

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,270
Everything is over now.

64
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,950
My innocence was proven

65
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,550
after the investigation.

66
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,550
They then released me.

67
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:42,880
Come on now.

68
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,270
I managed

69
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,600
to survive this.

70
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,830
You should be happy.

71
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,350
Gao Jun is here too.

72
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,350
Don't make a fool of yourself in front of him.

73
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,670
She's like this.

74
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,760
You must have gotten used to it by now.

75
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,350
What did you call me just now?

76
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,550
You prefer Attorney Gao

77
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,160
instead of Gao Jun then?

78
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,270
Just ignore him.

79
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,350
It's late now.

80
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,440
I should go.

81
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,720
I'll let you two have a chat.

82
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,640
Thank you for the lift.

83
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,390
Well...

84
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,830
Good night.

85
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,350
Good night.

86
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,200
Call me

87
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,350
if there's anything.

88
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,950
Sleep with me tonight.

89
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,350
We need to talk.

90
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,160
So what is the situation?

91
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,350
It's not what you have in mind.

92
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,550
I don't have anything in my mind.

93
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,350
I can sleep in the study.

94
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,640
If that's not enough,

95
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,430
I can stay in a hotel.

96
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,070
Shut up.

97
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,070
Come on.

101

to pass those photos to him.

102
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,070
Xu also told me in private

103
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,920
that the firm has sent the photos you provided

104
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,480
to the National Supervisory Commission.

105
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,110
Are they good enough as evidence?

106
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,510
They should be.

107
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,640
Enough

108
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,440
to give them hell at least.

109
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,040
You mentioned

110
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,830
Zhang Xiyao before.

111
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,600
You were close to her.

112
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,390
I can't believe she would do this.

113
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,920
She's too eager to get her big break.

114
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,640
Sleep now.

115
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,480
Regardless,

116
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,040
everything is over now.

117
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,440
Let your body rest.

118

They

119
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,470
haven't heard the last of me.

120
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,910
Su Wen.

121
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:43,960
Just let me rant.

122
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,200
Cursing them makes me feel good.

123
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,320
Sleep now. I'm knackered.

124
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,150
Do you know how long it has been

125
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,440
since I last

126
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,640
had a good sleep?

127
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,440
Let me wake up

128
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,440
naturally tomorrow.

129
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,110
Don't wake me up.

130
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,840
Okay.

[Careful. Someone wants to abduct you.]

133
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:47,960
Who gave this to you?

134
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,230
No idea.

135
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,110

00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,960
It's a good start.

139
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,590
After that,

140
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,640
the rest should be easy.

141
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,520
No.

142
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,910
Don't be reckless.

143
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,030
At this moment,

144
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,710
we should slow down.

145
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,640
Don't corner him that eagerly.

146
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,110
Don't worry. He won't be able to escape.

147
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,550
Everything is under control.

148
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,550
Just put your mind to rest.

I know this is hard on you,

rush anything.

154
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:53,880
Oh, right.

155
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,710
Just a reminder.

156
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,840
Be very careful.

157

see through your deception.

Put this in the kitchen.

164

I'll check if Su Wen is awake.

165
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,000
Did we wake you up?

166

start jogging in the morning?

to do more exercise.

170

Zhenzhen is weak.

171
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,320
She needs to start with a morning jog.

00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,500
Who looks after him then?

517
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,540
I heard from my brother

518
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,580
that he is getting a divorce.

519
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,580
Did his wife come?

520
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,060
I have never seen his wife.

521
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,780
Just his parents

522
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,940
and a relative.

523
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,460
Which relative?

524
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,300
No idea.

525
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,620
Hey, I'm here.

526
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,300
Let's speak in person.

527
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:32,460
Boss.

528
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,340
I have visited Lu Yang.

529
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,180
His father is still there.

530
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,580
How is Jiu's leg?

531
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,500
It still hurts.

532
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,580
The doctor told him to lie down.

533
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,340
You can go back.

534
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,140
I'll take over.

535
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,060
Okay.

536
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,100
I'll come tomorrow morning.

537
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,380
-Drive safe.
-Okay.

538
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,420
Have a seat.

539
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,140
Lu Yang's dad is in the hospital

540
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,180
for the entire day.

541
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,780
Someone else will take over his shift.

542
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,260
Let's see who it will be.

543
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,500
Didn't you

544
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,020
enter Lu Yang's ward before?

545
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,380
Who was in there?

546
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,020
I only saw his parents.

547
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,620
I'm in the elevator.

548
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,100
I'll come now.

549
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,700
I bought some fruit.

550
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,300
I'll leave now then.

551
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,340
Thank you.

552
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,580
If his stomach is acting up,

553
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,460
ask the nurse for some meds.
