00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,470
Haven't your glasses been fixed yet?

4
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,240
Here's your coffee.

5
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,750
Thank you.

6
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,240
Please enjoy your drinks.

7
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,000
My short-sightedness is not that serious.

8
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,000
So it doesn't matter if I don't wear my glasses.

9
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,910
Have you gotten the authentication report?

10
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,600
I'm sure

11
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,000
I had never put my fingerprints

12
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,670
on those agreements.

13
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,080
Why did the test result show

14
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,240
those were my fingerprints?

15
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,600
Fingerprints can be forged.

16
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,110
Forged?

17
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,550
You lived together.

18
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,880
So he had many opportunities

19
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,720
to make impressions

20
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,240
of your fingerprints.

21
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,000
It's not hard to do so.

22
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,440
Has the hearing been confirmed?

23
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:06,880
It's next Wednesday.

24
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,910
Judging from what they were implying,

25
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,240
it's unlikely

26
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,520
for the test result to be admissible

27
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,190
by the court.

28
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,080
They still need

29
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,720
to provide more justifications
for the evidence

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,800
to increase its probative value.

31
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,360
Other than the fingerprints,

32
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,600
the plaintiff contended

33
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,000
that Xu Youning used

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,830
my bank card.

35
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,630
What do we do about this?

36
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,360
What's this?

37
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,240
Take a look.

[Indictment]

39
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,470
Sue the bank?

40
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,030
We can sue the bank first.

41
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,550
As a result of their poor regulation,

42
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,470
someone

43
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,630
had stolen your identity

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,320
to apply for a bank card

45
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,550
without your prior knowledge.

46
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,110
Will this work?

47
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,230
Of course.

48
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,320
You have concrete evidence.

49
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,950
You always use cash

50
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,200
and never use a bank card.

51
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,160
But this still won't solve

52
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,070
the fundamental problem.

53
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,480
Everything that we do now

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,040
is to buy time.

55
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,000
If we really want

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,790
to solve this matter,

57
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,670
we can only solve it

58
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,040
when we know what happened with the money.

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,920
That 40 million yuan remains
the source of the problem,

60
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,480
right?

61
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,230
Yes.

Mr. Qiu, this way, please.

67
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:08,880
Come in.

68
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,790
What is it?

69
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,390
Anhe's share price hits the limit down today too.

70
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,440
When the market opened,

71
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,040
we set the limit order

72
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,200
as planned.

73
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,510
At first, it attracted

74
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,720
some investors who jumped on the bandwagon.

75
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,790
The selling pressure wasn't high either.

76
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,440
The share prices were already stabilizing.

77
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,200
The trading volume in the morning was not bad.

78
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,830
But during the afternoon session,

79
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,110
a large number of selling orders
suddenly happened,

80
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,760
which caused the shares

81
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,110
to hit the limit down.

82
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,760
Who was behind it?

83
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,200
Institutional investors.

84
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,320
I'm not sure.

85
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,160
What do you...

86
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,000
All right.

87
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,000
Inform Anhe to prepare an announcement

88
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,950
to reassure the investors.

89
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,160
Jinshang

90
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,110
will issue a statement

91
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,600
that it'll not reduce

92
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,600
its holdings of Anhe's shares for three years.

93
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,640
That's all.

94
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,760
Is this

95
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,160
proper?

96
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,720
We'll decide after we overcome this crisis.

97
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,390
All right.

98
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,110
I'll get it done right away.

99
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:54,950
Okay.

100
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,550
Why didn't you sell it?

101
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,760
Didn't I tell you

102
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,880
to sell all the shares?

103
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,110
Fool!

104
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,000
Don't be too greedy.

105
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,000
Do you think

106
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,760
your family owns the stock market?

107
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,960
I gave you a chance to cut losses.

108
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,960
Yet, you want to get back
what you lost before you leave?

109
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,520
Do you think that's possible?

110
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:41,470
Who do you think

111
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,590
set the limit order?

112
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,000
Who do you think is saving his own skin?

113
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,030
It was all Fang Jianshe's doing.

114
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,710
This old fellow

115
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,960
used Jinshang's funds

116
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,030
to save his own money.

117
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,880
I took a lot of trouble finding the USB,

118
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,590
the account,

119
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,470
and the password.

120
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,640
I took the risk

121
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,910
of introducing them to each other.

122
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,150
Look what happened now.

123
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,550
Because of your greed,

124
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,030
all the money is stuck there.

125
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
Everything I did was in vain.

126
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,550
Remedy?

127
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:08,910
There's no way to save the situation now.

128
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,470
Now, we can only watch

129
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,000
Fang Jianshe run away now.

130
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,400
Unless...

131
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,710
Unless Xu Youning is still alive.

132
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,590
Or else no one

133
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,200
can swindle the money from him.

134
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,000
The money will be transferred out soon.

135
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,280
Next, it depends on how you operate.

136
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,150
As long as Boss gives the order

137
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,880
to let us leave,

138
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,790
the days ahead

139
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,400
will be free endlessly.

140
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,710
Don't celebrate too early.

141
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,760
I know

142
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,000
the police and the CSRC

143
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,880
are watching.

144
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,200
Man,

145
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,200
you do things with caution.

146
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,030
You're young but prudent.

147
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,790
Any updates on Lu Yang?

148
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,110
He's still in a coma.

149
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,710
The doctor is not sure

150
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,200
when he'll wake up.

151
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,200
Have you found out who attacked him?

152
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,760
Who is the person

153
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,030
who has been

154
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,080
hiding?

155
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,670
It doesn't matter who that is.

156
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,960
There's nothing to be scared of anymore.

157
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,270
Xu Youning is already dead.

158
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,640
You sent someone

159
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,640
to approach Ruan Zhenzhen

160
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,790
with your own identity.

161
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,080
You didn't discover anything

162
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,110
that could expose everything.

163
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,030
There's nothing that can prove what we did.

164
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,790
Am I right?

165
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,320
Since that person is hiding,

166
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,150
there must be a reason for him to do so.

167
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,110
The person who uses my identity

168
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,080
may not be so reliable.

169
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,760
It's better to be careful.

170
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,760
So long as the matter is not solved,

171
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,230
it's not safe for us.

172
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,200
Okay.

173
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,790

I'll be clear from being a suspect.

00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:51,940
How about this?

516
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,820
It's not convenient to talk over the phone.

517
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,140
Let's meet up and discuss this in person.

518
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,740
Let's talk it out.

519
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,060
Okay?

520
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:05,980
Mr. Fang,

521
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,700
a dead person fears daylight.

522
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,060
It's better not to meet.

523
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,340
You

524
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,780
should give me the money.

525
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,860
So I can leave this world

526
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,060
in peace.

527
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:16,940
Or else,

528
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,580
I'll hand over

529
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,060
the thing in my hand.

530
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,380
How much do you want?

531
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,620
100 million yuan.

532
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,140
Didn't you say 40 million yuan?

533
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,860
That was the price for a living person.

534
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:41,580
The price

535
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,060
is different for the dead.

536
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,420
Be quick about it, Mr. Fang.

537
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,780
Don't let this get in the way of your big plan.

538
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,540
Someone is watching us.

539
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,100
What's wrong?

540
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,100
Are you disappointed

541
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,060
because he's not who you expected?

542
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,460
What are you hiding from me?

543
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,740
Can you tell me the truth?

544
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,780
I'm not hiding anything on purpose.

545
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,100
I'm just

546
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,060
so confused.

547
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,780
My mind

548
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,500
is a complete mess.

549
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,540
Can't you just

550
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,780
let me take care of everything?

551
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:36,740
No.

552
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,660
I no longer want to lose

553
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,500
the ability to make my own judgment

554
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,260
and be a doll

555
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,860
that only listens to someone's order.

556
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:52,900
Gao Jun,

557
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,740
I don't want to rely on you for everything.

558
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,020
Give me some time

559
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,060
to think about this myself.

560
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,380
Okay?

561
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:03,700
Jiu.

562
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,140
Qi,

563
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,380
Boss has no time for you

564
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,500
because he's hanging around

565
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,500
with Ruan Zhenzhen every day.

566
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,860
What should I do now?

567
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,260
I think

568
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,020
you should go back

569
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:14,900
to the office first.

570
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,780
After all, you made a mistake

571
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,100
and caused trouble for the company.

572
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,140
But the company

573
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,140
won't do anything drastic to you.

574
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,540
The company will just punish you.

575
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,900
It's just for show to the clients.

576
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,580
But Wu told me

577
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,300
that the company will rough me up.

578
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,380
Don't listen to her.

579
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,300
She was only scaring you.

580
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,090
Listen to me.

581
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,900
Go back to the office

582
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,020
and explain everything.

583
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,660
Then apologize to the client.

584
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,020
It'll be settled, then.

585
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,260
You betrayed me!

586
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,820
Qi, why are you running?

587
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:00,980
I'll come and pick you up tonight.

588
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,100
No, thanks.

589
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,220
You should get back to your work.

590
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:08,700
You don't have to go through such trouble.

591
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,380
My workplace is pretty near to my house.

592
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,540
I can just walk back.

593
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,340
If you drive me around in this car,

594
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,860
my colleagues will think

595
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,340
badly of me.

596
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,180
All right, then.
