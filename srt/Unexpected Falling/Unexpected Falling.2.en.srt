00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,080
I did not mean to offend you.

176
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,840
I take your case seriously.

177
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,710
However,

178
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,080
I need your cooperation too.

179
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,520
Tell me the truth.

180
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,710
Can you?

181
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,080
Mr. Gao, you must be mistaken.

182
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,440
First of all,

183
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,150
I did not complain

184
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,200
to Yan.

185
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,030
I don't see a need to do that

186
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,400
because I'm not close to him.

187
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,550
Secondly,

188
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,200
you're a busy man.

189
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,840
Don't let my case

190
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,960
bother you.

191
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,470
Thank you.

192
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,760
Are you sure?

193
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,520
The only lawyer

194
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,280
who can win your case

195
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,350
is me.

196
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,710
Bye.

197
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,110
Don't purchase luxury goods

198
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,110
with your bank card.

199
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,200
It could be used as evidence.

200
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,470
Thank you for your reminder.

201
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,910
Xu Youning, it's for you.

202
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,420
[Unknown Number]

203
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,080
Xu You...

204
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,550
Hi. Who's speaking?

205
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:14,710
It's me.

206
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,760
Save my number.

207
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:23,060
Mr. Gao, what can I help?

208
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,790
I suddenly

209
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,990
have a question for you.

210
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,310
Yes?

211
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,430
Xu Youning did not leave anything

212
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,140
pertinent to the loan.

213
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:33,870
Is that right?

214
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:36,670
I'm certain

215
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,430
that I was very clear about it yesterday.

216
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,470
I don't need...

217
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,990
Everything has been deleted?

218
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,620
Including messages, call history,

219
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,940
WeChat history, etc.

220
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,550
There was nothing on the phone.

221
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,110
Is that right?

222
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,620
He always did this?

223
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,110
What do you want?

224
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,310
If he simply wished

225
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,180
to conceal his debt,

226
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,380
he didn't have to go to such lengths.

227
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:03,790
He deleted

228
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,100
all the messages.

229
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,460
Perhaps,

230
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,950
he was

231
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,310
hiding something else too?

232
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:12,500
Mr. Gao.

233
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,140
I don't know what you're insinuating.

234
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,910
Are you free? Let's talk in person.

235
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,790
Mr. Gao.

236
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,140
Sorry, I'm late.

237
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,710
I came early.

238
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,310
It's a secluded place,

239
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,590
so I came to show you the way.

240
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:38,550
Let's go.

241
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,260
Mr. Gao.

242
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,740
You mentioned

243
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,460
that you didn't want to work for acquaintances.

244
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,030
Yes, I did say that.

245
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,620
We're not acquaintances, are we?

246
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,590
I don't have the money for your retainer fee.

247
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:52,830
I know.

248
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,030
The bank has seized

249
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,140
your house and frozen your account.

250
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:56,980
Why

251
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,030
are you helping me then?

252
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,460
We're not acquaintances,

253
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:00,860
so

254
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,950
you don't owe me any favor.

255
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,190
I have no money

256
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,980
to pay the retainer fee,

257
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,620
so you'll gain nothing from this.

258
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:06,980
Why are you

259
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,380
wasting your time and energy?

260
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,220
Also, Mr. Gao.

261
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,220
You were cold to me yesterday.

262
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,670
But today,

263
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,710
you're keen and warm.

264
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,860
Why?

265
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,380
Ruan Zhenzhen.

266
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:27,430
Xu Youning

267
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,260
took all your trust away,

268
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,340
didn't he?

269
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:31,830
Yes.

270
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,220
I did say

271
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,710
I do not like working for acquaintances.

272
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,030
I also know

273
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:37,950
you're penniless now.

274
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,830
You have nothing.

275
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,590
But we live in a society of networks.

276
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,500
Everyone is part of it.

277
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,190
I help you so that you will owe me a favor.

278
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,140
Is there a problem?

279
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,740
I owe you a favor?

280
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:50,910
Not necessarily you.

281
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,670
It could be Yan's or Su Wen's.

282
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,500
They might owe me a favor and I can make use of it.

283
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,070
Ruan Zhenzhen.

284
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,460
It's good to be cautious.

285
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,100
But when you doubt

286
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,070
and turn everything down...

287
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,460
Especially when you doubt

288
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,070
all the kindness extended towards you.

289
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,670
That is unwise.

290
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,340
What do you want to drink?

291
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:27,830
Hi, what would you like to order?

292
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:28,950
Iced Americano.

293
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,100
Make it two.

294
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,550
Okay. Have a seat.

295
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,140
I know how you must be feeling now,

296
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,590
but I still want to tell you

297
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,500
that not everyone harbors

298
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,980
a hidden agenda.

299
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,670
And not everyone fusses
about their losses and gains

300
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,140
whenever they start a new endeavor.

301
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,070
Let's get back to your case.

302
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,340
Other than wanting you to owe me a favor,

303
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,620
I also find this case

304
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,860
rather interesting.

305
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,070
Now, no need

306
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,130
to guess my motive.

307
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,790
In your situation,

308
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,340
there's literally nothing I can gain out of you.

309
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,190
I suppose I'm a cynic.

310
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,460
I have to see a client this afternoon.

311
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,500
Let's get down to business.

312
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:46,860
Xu Youning

313
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,030
cleared his phone data.

314
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,030
Other than concealing

315
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,340
his debt,

316
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,790
what else could it be, in your opinion?

317
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,590
I don't want

318
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,950
my husband to be wrongly accused.

319
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,670
Whether he had

320
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,430
any extramarital affairs or not,

321
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,030
as his wife,

322
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,140
I know the answer to it very well.

323
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:17,740
Sorry.

324
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,460
As an attorney,

325
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,550
I often see this kind of scenario.

326
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:34,620
You have the documents with you?

327
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,190
Come in.

328
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,310
Mr. Fang.

329
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:06,790
I need

330
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,220
to tell you something.

331
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,310
The formal notice from the inspection team

332
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,140
has arrived.

333
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,340
They will be here tomorrow afternoon.

334
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,550
Who will you send to accompany them?

335
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,590
Who are they?

336
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,590
I did check.

337
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,030
The company found

338
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,310
a consulting firm from Guangzhou

339
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:30,790
called HLZH.

340
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,430
You'll go.

341
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,670
I still have something to do.

342
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:36,860
Okay.

343
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,740
As for the standard...

344
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,430
Just follow the company's protocol.

345
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,140
Don't overshoot it.

346
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,070
Okay.

348
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,500
Okay.

349
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,070

351
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,140
Yes.

However,

355
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,380
you have to deal with his mess too.

356
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,070
Understood?

357
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:50,380
Right. Thank you, Mr. Qiu.

358
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:52,430
Don't let me down.

359
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,030
I'll handle

360
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,740
the rest for you.

361
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,030
There's something.

362
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:01,910
Yes.

any of the recipient accounts

366

00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:17,860
No.

368
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,260
Other than your bank card,

369
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,070
several accounts

370
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,100
have been used more than once.

371
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,260
For example, Li Mingyang's, Zhao Li's,

372
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:30,550
and

373
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,250
Xia Xinliang's.

374
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,070
They are the accounts

375
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,070
Xu Youning knew very well.

376
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,380
Or I should say

377
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,590
he controlled these accounts.

378
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:44,910
Have you tried

379
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,740
contacting those people?

380
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:51,790
I thought about it,

381
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,340
but I don't know where to start.

382
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,860
Youning's phone

383
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,260
does not have their contacts.

384
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,830
I asked the bank,

385
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,030
but they can't

386
00:24:59,030 --> 00:24:59,910
give me the clients' info.

387
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,550
Leaking the clients' info

388
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,380
is against the law.

389
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,380
You need a lawyer

390
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,100
to get a court order from the tribunal

391
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,950
before the bank can divulge

392
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,140
the info you seek.

393
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,100
Can you

394
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,380
get the court order for me then?

395
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,740
You can't get it

396
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,670
that easily.

397
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,430
For example, if you want to sue

398
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,590
all the account holders here,

399
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,590
you first need to file the case.

400
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,910
At the moment,

401
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,430
even if you want to sue them,

402
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,910
you lack evidence.

403
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,190
The court will not entertain you.

404
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,260
Be patient.

405
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,030
Take it step by step.

406
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,590
You're careless.

407
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,860
The creditor sues you,

408
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,740
but you never checked

409
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,620
those who received the money.

410
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,310
You're set up to fail.

411
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,380
Want to get some air?

412
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,740
I need to find a way

413
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,340
to locate those recipients.

414
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,670
And then, we'll ask them

415
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:15,910
why Xu Youning

416
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,070
took such a huge loan

417
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,620
and put the money in their accounts.

418
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:23,430
But where do we start?

419
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,670
Nanzhou is not huge per se.

420
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,340
Our social circle

421
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,430
can only be that big.

422
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,190
It's comprised of people we know

423
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,500
either from our daily life
or from our workplaces.

424
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,190
If there's a connection,

425
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,260
then it can never

426
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,590
be a random stranger.

427
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,430
There must be a clue somewhere.

428
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,070
Xu Youning borrowed so much money.

429
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,980
He must have accounting records.

430
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,310
He couldn't possibly
keep everything in his brain.

431
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,950
Have you gone through his belongings?

432
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,430
I checked our house.

433
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,790
No accounting records whatsoever.

434
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:01,710
And his office?

435
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,950
You should take a look.

436
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,220
You might be able to find something.

437

As for the hearing,

438
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,860
prepare your statement of defense first.

to Xu Youning's office to pack up

444
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,500
on Monday then.

What now?

520
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,900
Look.

521
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:39,540
We...

522
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:41,950
What should we do?

523
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:42,900
Get rid of it.

524
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:44,830
Get the toolbox.

525
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:55,900
Dude.

526
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,350
The quality of this wheel clamp

527
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,830
is better than ours.

528
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:01,950
I...

529
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:14,740
Dummy.

530
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,020
Bring the clamp here.

531
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,780
Bring the clamp here.

532
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,070
We'll just clamp this one then.

533
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,500
Done.

534
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:39,830
What are you doing?

535
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:42,260
The tire is deflating.

536
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,020
Run!

537
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,020
You're welcome!

538
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,390
They recommended me

one restaurant.

540
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:07,910
It's good, apparently.

541
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,190
I'll bring you there.

542
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,110
Excuse me.

543
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,260
Thank you.

544
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,390
Have you booked a hotel?

545
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,630
I'll let you know when I'm there.

Ma'am, please fasten your seat belt.

549

I have it. It's in the suitcase.

Mr. Songrong.

Can I get out?

557

Sure.

Hey, Mr. Gao.

568
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,540
Sorry.

569
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,700
Did I bother you?

570
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:32,940
Not at all.

571
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:34,110
You're in Nanzhou?

572
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,260
I'm on the plane.

573
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,590
I'll be there before dinner

574
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,110
and that's why I want to know

575
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,220
if you're free for a dinner tonight.

576
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,020
We can invite Yan too.

577
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,350
To discuss Ruan Zhenzhen's case?

578
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:43,390
Don't bring her up, please.

579
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:45,260
She's obstinate.

580
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:45,830
She

581
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,430
got on my nerves earlier on.

582
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,260
I hope she didn't upset you.

583
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,070
She's fine.

584
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,110
Please don't mind her

585
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:52,540
if she

586
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,630
did something

587
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,500
that ticks you off.

588
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,190
I apologize on her behalf.

589
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,430
She's a kind person,

590
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,910
but she lacks social skills.

591
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:00,780
She's not diplomatic

592
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,390
and it's often hard
to have a conversation with her.

593
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,910
I have seen her identity card.

594
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,390
Today is her birthday.

595
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,430
Is that why

596
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,150
you're flying here?

597
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,020
No.

598
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,670
I have some other business too.

599
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,220
Do you want

600
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,430
to eat with Ruan Zhenzhen tonight then?

601
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:19,540
You said you wanted to have dinner with me.

602
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:20,740
Let's forget about Yan.

603
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,020
Yan has a strict wife and he won't be able to make it.

604
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,740
Why don't we celebrate

605
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,870
Ruan Zhenzhen's birthday together?

606
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,110
Don't let her spend her birthday alone.

607
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:29,980
Sure.

608
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,110
All right.

609
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,390
Sir.

610
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,700
Please fasten your seat belt.

611
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,190
Okay.

612
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,390
Ma'am.

613
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:45,020
The plane

614
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:45,980
will take off soon.

615
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,870
Please switch off your phone

616
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:47,940
and return to your seat.

617
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:51,500
Ma'am.

618
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,940
Please return to your seat.

619
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,350
Okay?

620
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:53,740
In a second.

621
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,300
Hi, I'd like to order a cake.

622
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,390
Nothing too huge.

623
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,500
But enough for three people.

624
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,430
Those bastards

625
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,780
are pissing me off.

626
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:06,910
One wheel is not enough.

627
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,100
They just had to clamp two wheels.

628
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,430
Idiots.

629
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,350
Do they have too many clamps?

630
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,350
Thank you so much.

631
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,980
They can clamp it if they want.

632
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,020
If I didn't want

633
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,540
to pack Youning's stuff in his workplace,

634
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,740
I wouldn't need this car anyway.

635
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,630
Why they only asked you to pack his stuff now?

636
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:26,870
No idea.

637
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,830
Maybe they were busy

638
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,630
during the Chinese New Year.

639
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:30,740
Gang.

640
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,070
Will you ever lie to Yu?

641
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,630
Did you ever lie to Yu?

642
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,740
What's the matter, Zhenzhen?

643
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,590
In what circumstance

644
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,630
will you clear

645
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,940
your phone data?

646
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,190
Your messages, your call history,

647
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:57,460
and WeChat chat history.

648
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,150
All of them.

649
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,630
Zhenzhen, I believe

650
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,190
selling the clamps can give us some money.

651
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,300
Do you want them? If not, I'll take them away.

652
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:07,630
I'm asking you a question, Gang.

653
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,190
In what circumstance

654
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,540
will you clear your phone data?

655
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,780
Zhenzhen, is this

656
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,150
about Youning's phone?

657
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:34,020
Zhenzhen.

658
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,350
Sometimes, it's not about

659
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,830
deception.

660
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,500
Maybe he just didn't want

661
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,260
unnecessary quarrels.

662
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,150
I don't think

663
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,300
he lied

664
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,220
to you.

665
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,220
You two were together for many years.

666
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:46,780
You know him

667
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,780
very well, don't you?

668
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:49,540
As for the debt,

669
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:51,780
I think he just

670
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,830
didn't want you to worry.

671
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,260
Zhenzhen, you have

672
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,300
never met a true liar.

673
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:57,980
They would possess several phones.

674
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,630
Sell the clamps then.

675
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:02,910
Thank you so much.

676
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,390
Don't sweat it, Zhenzhen.

677
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,110
Oh, right.

678
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,460
Should I

679
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,020
come with you?

680
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,070
I'm free this morning.

681
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:10,460
Ma is manning the stall for me.

682
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,150
No need.

683
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:12,740
Okay.

684
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:14,630
Yu is in the office too.

685
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:15,780
Just call her if you need anything.

686
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,150
Wait, Zhenzhen.

687
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:28,430
Zhenzhen,
