(For me,)

4
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,510
Tan Shen

5
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,480
was my lifesaver.

00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,720
Was posting the evidence of the affair

7
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,080
Tan Shen's idea?

8
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,000
Zhu Xiaolei's lover

9
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,080
provoked me.

10
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,880
I lost it,

11
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,520
so I posted

12
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,750
all the evidence that Tan Shen

13
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,550
helped me find online on impulse.

14
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,470
How was the talk?

15
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,830
You didn't just sympathize

16
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,910
with An Ruiyun, did you?

17
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,550
You had

18
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,030
some other feelings

19
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,750
for her.

20
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:41,800
Yes.

21
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,960
She asked me to return this card to you

22
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:51,910
and said she doesn't need it.

23
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,910
And she thanks you for taking care of Yiyi

24
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,470
for so many years.

25
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,520
Also,

26
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,670
she asked me to tell you this.

27
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:05,960
She said

28
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,270
Zhu Xiaolei

29
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,670
was irritated by her words

30
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,630
that day.

31
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,720
It has nothing to do with you.

32
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,600
It was me who irritated Zhu Xiaolei.

33
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,830
I also hope

34
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,110
he can forgive me for my selfishness.

35
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,670
Go and say hello.

36
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,640
Get it.

37
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,480
Okay.

38
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,110
You can't even get it.

39
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,440
Why did you kick it over there?

40
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,920
How can you blame me?

41
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,760
Don't you have anything to ask?

42
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,550
Did you change your job

43
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,660
because of An Ruiyun's case?

44
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,320
I tend to

45
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,880
go to extremes.

46
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,040
And I don't like being controlled.

47
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,160
So I'm tired

48
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,040
of being well-dressed

49
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,320
and dealing

50
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,040
with people.

51
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,920
It was the first time

52
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,720
I faced my true self

53
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,760
in An Ruiyun's case.

54
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,760
It seems

55
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,920
An Ruiyun herself

56
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,720
made every decision in that case.

57
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,070
In fact,

58
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,160
I'm behind all this.

59
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,640
I made her more furious

60
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,200
and more extreme.

61
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,640
So I bear a huge responsibility

62
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,160
for that result.

63
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:52,950
Do you

64
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,040
want to know what I think?

65
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,270
Sure.

66
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,350
Objective conditions

67
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,230
do affect subjective consciousness.

68

in the end,

70
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,320
it depends on their consciousness,

71

doesn't it?

Rest assured.

75
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,280
Why is she here?

76
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:36,790
I wonder too.

77

78

How could it be blackmailing?

00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,590
I almost lost my reputation.

176
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,880
What's wrong with asking for compensation

177
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,550
for psychological injuries?

178
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,280
Shouldn't I do that?

179
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,200
You're breaking the law.

180
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,320
Even if I break the law,

181
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,440
does it have anything to do with you?

182
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,320
Are you a police officer or a judge?

183
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,670
I don't want you to go astray.

184
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,110
Go astray?

185
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,110
I have nowhere to go.

186
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,080
Ruan Zhenzhen.

187
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,550
The kidney you gave me

188
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,710
will soon stop working.

189
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,790
Can you give me another one?

190
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:08,910
Can you?

191
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,000
I need money.

192
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,520
I need money to survive.

193
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,320
I haven't lived enough.

194
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,170
Su Wen.

195
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,340
You're not this kind of person.

196
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,610
I am this kind of person.

197
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,370
I don't want to die.

198
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,490
I want to live on.

199
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,930
I don't want to lie in the hospital bed

200
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,370
waiting for a miracle.

201
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,730
There's only one fool like you.

202
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,780
I'll never meet another one.

203
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,900
Do you know

204
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,660
what you're holding?

205
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,490
It's evidence

206
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,780
that can bring Fang Jianshe down.

207
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:58,930
It's money.

208
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:01,860
Listen to me.

209
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:03,690
Give it to me.

210
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,820
Let me go, okay?

211
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:06,780
It has

212
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,730
nothing to do with you.

213
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,450
Just pretend as if you know nothing.

214
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:14,540
Give it to me.

215
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,420
Su Wen.

216
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,420
I only have you.

217
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,850
I only have you.

218
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,780
No matter what you do,

219
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,780
you can't fool me.

220
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,370
You want more money

221
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,090
just to

222
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,370
pay my debts.

223
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,970
Don't flatter yourself.

224
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,970
It has nothing to do with you.

225
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,250
But have you ever thought about it?

226
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,610
Do you think I could take the money with ease

227
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,730
if you give it to me?

228
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:18,820
Ruan Zhenzhen.

229
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,060
Are you a fool?

230
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:22,420
I can

231
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,540
handle it well.

232
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,250
Not only can you pay off your debts,

233
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,420
but you also don't have to worry
for the rest of your life.

234
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,420
Do you get it?

235
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,610
What about you?

236
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,180
I'm dying.

237
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,060
I won't live long.

238
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,820
You can't go.

239
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,350
[Police]

240
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,400
[Reception Room]

241
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,660
Let me go with you.

242
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,970
No, I can do it myself.

243
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,090
Sir.

244
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,420
Qiu.

245
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,180
All our efforts are in vain.

246
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,060
Sir.

247
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,660
I didn't expect

248
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,540
that someone would take the video.

249
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,180
It's too late to say that.

250
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,850
I will have to sacrifice you.

251
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,060
I have no other choice.

252
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,730
It's good for you, me,

253
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,610
and everyone.

254
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,060
As for your daughter

255
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,090
and your family,

256
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,540
I'll arrange for someone
to take good care of them.

257
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:15,540
Sir.

258
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,250
Things are not as bad

259
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,210
as we think.

260
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,090
It's just a video.

261
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,300
It can't prove anything.

262
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,210
As for Su Wen,

263
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,300
it's easy to take care of her

264
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:28,970
since she's asking for money.

265
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,730
It's not about money.

266
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,060
Giving her money
will only bring endless trouble.

267
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:42,900
Don't be so nervous.

268
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:44,900
After all,

269
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,090
it's an economic crime.

270
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,330
You'll only be in prison for a few years.

271
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:53,780
As long as I'm here,

272
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,300
I won't treat you unfairly.

273
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,370
Hurry up.

274
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,660
We can gain the upper hand

275
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,060
if we take the initiative now.

276
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,820
Sorry for making you go through this.

277
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,250
Sir.

278
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,610
It's possible

279
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,420
to escape punishment
and commit suicide in such a situation.

280
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,250
But you won't.

281
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,330
Because you're smart.

282
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:50,820
Right?

283
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,330
I get it, sir.

284
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:53,060
Eight.

285
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:53,730
Q.

286
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:55,940
One K.

287
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,130
Pass.

288
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,610
One 2.

289
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,580
Su Wen.

290
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:11,900
Did you go to Jinshang?

291
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:14,090
Yes.

292
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,050
How did it go?

293
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,180
Yan Xiaowen.

294
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,300
Turn yourself in.

295
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,060
What do you mean?

296
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,700
You're burning bridges, aren't you?

297
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,210
Hey!

298
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:50,660
(Hello.)

299
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,850
(The number)

300
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:52,970
(you have dialed is engaged.)

301
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,610
(Please try later.)

302
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,700
Why did I believe you?

303
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,700
Su Wen!

304
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:05,700
One 2.

305
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:06,900
Pass.

306
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:07,780
One 6.

307
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:09,820
One Q.

308
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,610
Pass. Your turn.

309
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:12,900
Your turn.

310
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:13,940
Thank you, Boss.

311
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,580
-Five 5s.
-Did you put chili?

312
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,020
Yes.

313
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:16,850
What was it?

314
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,730
Five 5s.

315
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:20,900
Hurry up.

316
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:21,900
One A.

317
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:22,660
-Pass.
-No.

318
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,850
Shall we go and check on her?

319
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,580
Just leave her alone for a while.

320
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:38,300
Sometimes,

321
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,090
something can only

322
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,490
be faced

323
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,450
and digested by oneself.

324
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,370
No matter

325
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,780
how close you are,

326
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,250
you can't share the burden.

327
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,130
Are you comprehending life?

328
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,420
Sort of.

329
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:03,180
Life is unpredictable.

330
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:05,700
You never know

331
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,900
what will happen in the future.

332
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,730
There are too many unpredictable things.

333
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:14,540
But there are also

334
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,450
many unexpected things in life.

335
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:16,940
Don't be so pessimistic.

336
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:18,940
Be positive.

337
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,490
It could be a good thing

338
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:27,540
or a disaster.

339
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,420
But no matter what happens,

340
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,730
we have to face it.

341
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:45,900
You're right.

342
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,610
Where are you going?

343
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,330
Thank you.

344
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,020
I'm giving them a hand.

345
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,850
Sit down. Are you a fool?

346
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:55,450
Sit down.

347
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:56,660
You're so oblivious.

348
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,130
I'm not a match for you two. I quit.

349
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,700
Mr. Xiao.

350
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,850
We had a deal.

351
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,450
How can you stand me up?

352
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,020
I know you're busy.

353
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:43,850
When will you be free, then?

354
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:46,180
Okay.

355
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,850
I'll wait to hear from you.

356
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:49,730
Okay. Bye.

357
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,490
He said he couldn't come

358
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,420
because of something urgent.

359
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:10,610
Jianshe.

360
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,450
Why are you looking

361
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,850
for a helmsman in such a hurry?

362
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,450
Isn't it too worthy for him?

363
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:16,490
What do you think?

364
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,210
How can I

365
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,940
read your mind, Mr. Fang?

366
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,130
I heard

367
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:34,900
that something happened to Qiu Zhijian.

368
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:36,820
They can't reach him on his phone.

369
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:37,940
Who told you that?

370
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,970
It's just

371
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:42,940
a gust of wind

372
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,490
coming to me.

373
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,330
The inspection team found a small problem.

374
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:48,700
It's no big deal.

375
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:04,180
Hello?

376
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,730
You found him?

377
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,730
Okay.

378
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:15,970
No hurry.

379
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,900
Do it after dark.

380
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,660
Don't let Xia

381
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,940
run away this time.

382
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,250
Who are you scheming against again?

383
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,730
A nobody.

384
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,780
Not worth mentioning.

385
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,180
You play first.

386
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,700
I'm going to the washroom.

387
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:45,610
Okay.

388
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,730
Hello?

389
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,370
You'd better leave now.

390
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,660
Fang already knows

391
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,490
where you are.

392
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,300
(If Boss doesn't want you to leave,)

393
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,490
none of you can get away.

394
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:37,660
Do you understand?

395
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:40,300
Yes.

396
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,130
Do you really understand?

397
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:48,540
Yes.

398
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,700
It's simple.

399
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:55,900
You caused the trouble.

400
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,660
Boss won't let you go

401
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,250
if you

402
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,580
don't handle it well.

403
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,370
You can't let the trouble

404
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:03,580
get him in trouble.

405
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:04,700
No.

406
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:05,940
Please tell the boss

407
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:06,850
that I won't

408
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:07,580
get him in trouble.

409
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:08,820
Are you sure?

410
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:14,490
It's obvious.

411
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:18,250
If the sparks can't be put out,

412
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,970
it'll get to our boss.

413
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:26,250
Secretary Chen.

414
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:27,490
It's not

415
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:28,580
that I don't want to snuff the sparks out.

416
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,450
Nobody dares to kill anyone

417
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:32,360
in this situation,

418
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,940
no matter how much money you offer.

419
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,210
You can do it yourself.

420
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,730
You can leave

421
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,530
if you get things done.

422
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,010
Didn't I tell you to wait outside?

423
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,100
There are more people outside.

424
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,060
Now besides the police,

425
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,890
Fang is looking for you too.

426
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,170
Make sure you hide well.

427
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:51,770
Don't contact me for the time being.

428
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,820
I'll send you out

429
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,290
when I find someone.

430
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:56,530
That's all?

431
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:57,740
Who still

432
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,010
carries cash now?

433
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,490
You can only withdraw 20,000 yuan a day from an ATM.

434
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:03,100
How many days can I live with this little money?

435
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:05,700
Bear it for a few days.

436
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,820
You can spend the money

437
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,410
as you please

438
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,490
after going out.

439
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,380
The password is on the back of it.

440
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,250
Is Fang's twenty million yuan in it?

441
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:22,900
Why would I lie to you?

442
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:24,660
Keep it well.

443
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:25,730
Spend it after going out.

444
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,100
You'd better hurry up.

445
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,060
I'm more anxious than you.

446
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,620
You should go now.

447
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:35,970
Be careful when you go out.

448
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,420
Stay away from security cameras.

449
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,450
Lu Yang doesn't even know

450
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:42,730
that I pretended to be Xu Youning.

451
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,730
How did Fang know?

452
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,490
How did he know where I was hiding?

453
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,060
How do I know?

454
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,580
Anyway, he knew it now.

455
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:55,620
Oh, right.

456
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:56,900
Let me remind you.

457
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,970
Don't be obsessed with money

458
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:00,010
and mess with him again.

459
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:02,490
What?

460
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:03,970
Didn't we agree

461
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,100
to blackmail him as much as we can?

462
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,730
That was before.

463
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:07,970
Now, things are different.

464
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,660
All right. Leave now.

465
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,180
Why do you have to return

466
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,660
to Guangzhou to cooperate
with the investigation?

467
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,620
They don't even tell you
what's the investigation about.

468
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,250
What are you worried about?

469
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,250
If it was an investigation against me,

470
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,250
they would have

471
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,730
taken me away like last time.

472
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:53,730
They wouldn't call me

473
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:54,820
to tell me to go back.

474
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,730
Since they called me,

475
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,860
it means it has nothing to do with me.

476
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,010
I guess

477
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:02,060
it has something to do

478
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,730
with Zhang Xiyao framing me.

479
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:05,530
That girl

480
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,660
is too bold.

481
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,180
She has to be punished.

482
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:10,420
She's young, after all.

483
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:11,970
She has the capability.

484
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:14,100
She went astray
because she wanted to get promoted.

485
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,970
She can't harm others even so.

486
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,900
She almost screwed you over.

487
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,820
Stop talking about others.

488
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:24,930
Let's talk about you.

489
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:27,290
About me?

490
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,210
I'm doing fine.

491
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,200
Don't play dumb.

492
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,440
How are you doing

493
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,580
with Tan Shen?

494
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:44,970
Let nature take its course.

495
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,420
Don't worry.

496
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:55,290
I don't care

497
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,900
who you're seeing.

498
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:58,100
But

499
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,490
I have one more thing to remind you.

500
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,490
Don't get too involved in anything.

501
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,420
Before getting too invested,

502
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,530
think about whether it's worth it.

503
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:21,660
It's worth it.

504
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:24,660
Are you so sure?

505
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,690
He's nice.

506
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,060
Nice?

507
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,140
What's good about him?

508
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,210
When I first met him,

509
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,140
I thought he was ruthless.

510
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,620
But when I got to know him,

511
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:43,730
I found

512
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:44,770
that he's quite genuine.

513
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:47,380
There's a hero

514
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:49,730
living in his heart.

515
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,770
Do you really like him?

516
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,060
I do.

517
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:17,290
I just got the news.

518
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,690
Qiu Zhijian turned himself in

519
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,900
and took all the blame.

520
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:23,340
He took all the blame?

521
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:25,930
Doesn't that mean Fang Jianshe

522
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:26,690
managed to get away?

523
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,820
I'm going back to the firm tomorrow.

524
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,930
Let me ask Mr. Xu about the situation.

525
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:33,900
He should

526
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,250
know it better.

527
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,970
[Lu Yang]

528
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,340
Hello?

529
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,010
Speak.

530
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:33,010
Fang Jianshe.

531
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,530
You're really something.

532
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,340
Do you think you'll be fine

533
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,250
if you ask Qiu Zhijian

534
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,290
to take the blame?

535
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:42,380
Don't forget

536
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,900
that I have something against you with me.

537
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,250
Let me remind you again.

538
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,530
Give me all the money now.

539
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:49,900
Or

540
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,770
I'll hand it over.

541
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,530
At that time,

542
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:57,930
someone will kill you.

543
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,930
You're Xia Xinliang, right?

544
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,140
Drop the act.

545
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,290
I know you're Xia Xinliang.

546
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,530
Do you know

547
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:24,770
what I found in the car?

548
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:27,420
It must not be that list.

549
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:29,530
Otherwise,

550
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,290
you won't pretend

551
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:32,900
to be Xu Youning.

552
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:38,140
Are you sure?

553
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:40,420
Not only am I sure,

554
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,290
but I also know that Shen Nanqiu

555
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:43,660
is colluding with you.

556
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,410
I don't know what you're talking about.

557
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:48,770
Really?

558
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:50,970
Then I'll say something

559
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:52,100
you can understand.

560
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,620
Did Shen Nanqiu promise

561
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:57,010
to send you out?

562
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:59,420
And she promised to share the money with you.

563
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,770
Just give up.

564
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,290
Shen Nanqiu

565
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:06,100
won't give you a penny.

566
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:09,820
Sending you abroad?

567
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,770
She means to take you out.

568
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:15,290
She plans to

569
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:16,820
pin everything on you,

570
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,730
so her hands will be clean.

571
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:19,900
Nothing will be traced

572
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,900
back to her.

573
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:22,420
Do you get it now?

574
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,530
She wouldn't dare.

575
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,420
I have the account number.

576
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,580
Are you sure

577
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,620
the account is real?
