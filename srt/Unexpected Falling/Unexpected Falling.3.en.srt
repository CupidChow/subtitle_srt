Your sister-in-law asked me to give it to you.

My sister-in-law asked you?

She must have

asked Gang to help her with something again.

She's always asking Gang to do something.

Just this morning, Gang was called

to help break a lock.

190

the business number

515
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,540
we got from the Internet.

516
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,780
And no one seems to know the guy.

517
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:33,700
Oh, right.

518
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,020
Can't you

519
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,150
ask the courthouse

520
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:36,870
for a way

521
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:37,740
to contact Xia Xinliang?

522
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,390
He's not directly involved in the case.

523
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,260
He's just the receiver

524
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,740
of the funds Xu Youning got

525
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,460
from the plaintiff.

526
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:46,740
Why would the court

527
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,740
have his contact details?

528
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,630
So this means

529
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,300
we'll have to locate him ourselves.

530
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,220
Never mind.

531
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,670
To bump into that person

532
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,260
in the office

533
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,390
was already fortuitous.

534
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,740
That could be just the lead we need.

535
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,300
We need only follow the trail

536
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,910
and we should be able to uncover the truth.

537
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,910
Zhenzhen, did you find anything else?

538
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:16,980
Ruan Zhenzhen.

539
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,630
Ruan Zhenzhen!

540
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,540
We're asking

541
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,260
if you found anything else in his office.
