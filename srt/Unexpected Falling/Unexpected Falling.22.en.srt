[Unexpected Falling]

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,980
[Episode 22]

3
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,080
I'm nothing but a housewife

4
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,000
with no future.

5
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,680
I'm just a pet

6
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,550
Xu Youning kept at home.

7
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,590
I stay home

8
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,680
until my brain has become dull.

9
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,870
I'm not smart, and I'm hopeless.

10
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,310
I'm just useless.

11
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,080
Isn't this what you're trying to say?

12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,800
Ruan Zhenzhen.

13
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,750
You went too far.

14
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:14,960
Su Wen.

15
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,750
You know me best.

16
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,910
You should know I hate being lied to

17
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,720
and being used.

18
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,080
Give me all the documents

19
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,830
of Xu Youning.

20
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,160
I won't investigate further.

21
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,720
You can continue

22
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,910
the investigation if you want,

23
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,240
but please, leave me alone.

24
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,320
We need to sort this out.

25
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,550
Ruan Zhenzhen.

26
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,800
Miss, your bag.

27
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,320
Ruan Zhenzhen.

28
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,470
Bring the documents back

29
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,750
to the office.

30
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,360
Okay.

31
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,320
And then,

32
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,720
ask Mr. Zhang

33
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,240
to hold a meeting.

34
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,160
-Ask him...
-Ruan Zhenzhen.

35
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,520
Don't go.

36
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,600
We need to sort it out.

37
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,360
I asked you to take up the lawsuit.

38
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,630
I asked you to retrace the recipients.

39
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,630
I studied your documents.

40
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,520
I asked for your bank statement.

41
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,670
I did all these to use you?

42
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,830
Is that what you're thinking?

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,600
Answer me!

44
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,750
Is that what you're thinking?

45
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:38,270
Just what kind of person

46
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,520
am I in your eyes?

47
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,520
Where is your good conscience?

48
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,440
You, of all people,

49
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,960
should know how I always treat you.

50
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,030
Ruan Zhenzhen.

51
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,960
Open the door.

52
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,470
Open up.

53
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,670
-Ruan Zhenzhen!
-Just go now.

54
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,360
Okay.

55
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,030
Ruan Zhenzhen!

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,750
Ruan Zhenzhen!

57
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,000
What are you doing?

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,550
Let go of me.

59
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,960
She owes me an explanation.

60
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,030
Enough!

61
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,630
We'll speak inside.

62
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,750
Come on.

63
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:09,960
Listen to me.

64
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,440
Hurry.

65
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,630
Come on.

66
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,830
Come here.

67
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,110
This room.

68
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:20,720
Come on.

69
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,600
Do you know

70
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,350
what you were just now?

71
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,040
A scornful woman.

72
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,550
So?

73
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,500
First time?

74
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,350
Sorry.

75
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,230
I apologize.

76
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:34,950
Okay?

77
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,320
Calm down, all right?

78
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,230
Don't

79
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,390
vent your frustration on me.

80
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,830
It's not fair to me.

81
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,230
What happened between you two?

82
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,230
Why did you argue

83
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,440
with Ruan Zhenzhen?

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,550
You two were two peas in a pod.

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,200
That idiot, Ruan Zhenzhen,

86
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,600
bought into some naysayers

87
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,270
and thought I handled her case

88
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,070
to fulfill my other agenda.

89
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,320
For personal gain.

90
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,760
Idiot. What a fool!

91
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,390
Ruan Zhenzhen

92
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,830
sure is very naive.

93
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,270
Everyone can see how much

94
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:15,950
you devote yourself

95
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,070
to her.

96
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,950
Su Wen,

97
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,640
we're all adults here.

98
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,270
If you get along with her, you hang out with her.

99
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,390
If not, you create distance.

100
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,320
You know nothing.

101
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm just trying to comfort you.

102
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,350
No offense,

103
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,320
but Ruan Zhenzhen and you

104
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,830
are not on the same page.

105
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,230
You can't just cling

106
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,510
to the sweet memories you have with her.

107
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,920
A non-reciprocal

108
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,070
relationship

109
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,110
will not last.

110
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,040
Stop it!

111
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,040
I'm just

112
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,070
defending you.

113
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,550
What do you know?

114
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,000
You don't need to defend me.

115
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,110
I'm happy to take care of Ruan Zhenzhen.

116
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,760
I'm happy to be a giver.

117
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:17,920
Okay.

118
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,320
You want to be a giver.

119
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,480
But you keep

120
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,670
giving.

121
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,550
Did she give you anything in return?

122
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,230
You can do better, do you know?

123
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,440
I can't.

124
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,200
I

125
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,480
truly can't do better.

126
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,880
What did Ruan Zhenzhen give me, you ask?

127
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,640
You asked me what she gave me.

128
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,480
She gave me her kidney.

129
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,920
That kidney is hers.

130
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,550
She...

131
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,350
She was with me when I went abroad

132
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,550
for the kidney transplant.

133
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,200
It was her kidney.

134
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,640
She gave me her kidney.

135
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,440
What did she give me, you ask?

136
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,510
I don't know how I'm supposed

137
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,440
to repay her.

138
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,600
She's an idiot.

139
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,390
She thought

140
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,320
I wouldn't see through her lies

141
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,390
and I wouldn't know.

142
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,760
Of course, I would know.

143
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,550
I'm not an idiot

144
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,830
like her.

145
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,510
Five days after the surgery,

146
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,950
she came to visit me
even though she could barely walk.

147
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,720
During the dog days,

148
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,270
she covered herself tightly,

149
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,600
saying that she didn't want

150
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,040
to spread her cold to me.

151
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,950
Did she think I was stupid?

152
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,950
After that,

153
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,040
she avoids me whenever she gets changed

154
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,550
because she doesn't want me to see the scar.

155
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,790
She doesn't want me to feel like

156
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,520
I owe her something.

157
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,550
How can I not feel that way?

158
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,710
All right. There, there.

159
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,350
You two

160
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,960
are both idiots.

161
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,760
I'm not an idiot.

162
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,960
I'm a jerk.

163
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,550
But I didn't use her.

164
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,080
I just wanted to help her.

165
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,960
I could give up everything

166
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,520
to help her find out the truth

167
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,910
about Xu Youning.

168
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,760
How could she

169
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,710
accuse me of those things?

170
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,960
(I'm just worried that some people)

171
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,470
(might use their connections)

172
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,670
(to spread rumors)

173
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,350
(for their gain,)

174
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,960
that will be grim.

175
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:05,960
Have some water.

176
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,030
Do you feel better now?

177
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,200
You were talking about Xu Youning.

178
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,350
What did you find?

179
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,280
Can you not look at me

180
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,080
like that?

181
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,520
Forget that I asked then.

182
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,080
Yan Xiaowen.

183
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,880
Knowing your relationship with Xu Youning,

184
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,280
I doubt your innocence.

185
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,840
You'd better pray those things

186
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,000
did not come to harm Ruan Zhenzhen.

187
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,110
Otherwise, I will give you hell.

188
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,320
I...

189
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:11,960
Why would I frame Xu...

190
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,000
Why would I frame Ruan Zhenzhen?

191
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,880
I'm not crazy.

192
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,400
Give me back my bag.

193
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,000
Why do you need to reapply your makeup?

194
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,320
Your voice has already cracked.

195
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,640
Take leave

196
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,760
and rest in the hotel.

197
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,320
No.

198
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,910
I will not run away.

199
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,230
I won't give them the chance

200
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,960
to mock me.

201
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,350
Gao Jun, it's me.

202
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,150
Su Wen.

203
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,910
It'll be complicated otherwise.

204
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:13,590
Noted, Mr. Qiu.

205
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,910
Hi, Mr. Qiu.

206
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,200
Go first.

207
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,520
-Okay.
-Okay.

208
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,700
[Chairman]

209
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,910
Su Wen was obviously

210
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,520
provoking me.

211
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,230
I suppose she prefers

212
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,910
to do it the hard way.

213
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,840
You mean...

214
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,710
Su Wen said

215
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,080
you love

216
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,590
the red velvet cake from this cafe.

217
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,440
Especially when you're upset.

218
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,710
She said to find you here

219
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,320
if you weren't home.

220
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:12,820
[1/2 Coffee]

221
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,520
Why did you fight with Su Wen?

222
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,230
Her investigation into Xu Youning

223
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,400
has put a target on her back.

224
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,640
I don't want her to take any risk for me.

225
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,470
But she has been

226
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,590
investigating Jinshang.

227
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's not her first day there.

228
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,150
She lied to me.

229
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,030
She said it was

230
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,840
a routine audit.

231
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,000
That it had nothing to do with Xu Youning.

232
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,590
When Fang Jianshe hinted at me today,

233
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,280
I realized

234
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,280
that Su Wen has been

235
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,350
investigating Xu Youning.

236
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,470
And she

237
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,470
makes them queasy.

238
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,710
Understandable.

239
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,880
Su Wen is in a unique position.

240
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,350
She's on the inspection team.

241
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,520
She has access to the confidential documents

242
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,470
of Jinshang

243
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,910
and is close to you.

244
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,840
She can find out

245
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,030
many secrets.

246
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,200
She just has to put

247
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,280
two and two together

248
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,590
and everything reveals itself.

249
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,350
Any other person

250
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,840
will be extra wary of her too.

251
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,200
So I can't

252
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,280
let her continue.

253
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,590
It's too risky.

254
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:15,400
Just look at Lu Yang.

255
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:16,910
You know

256
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,350
they are ruthless.

257
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,670
But perhaps Su Wen

258
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,470
can help you

259
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,670
find those 40 million yuan.

260
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,710
At the cost of her life?

261
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,000
I would rather

262
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,200
repay that 40 million debt.

263
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,840
You two

264
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,110
are trying to protect each other,

265
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,400
so why can't you converse properly?

266
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,350
You had to quarrel.

267
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,520
You don't know Su Wen.

268
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,760
She won't hesitate

269
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,880
to charge forward

270
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,200
to protect you

271
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,550
even after you tell her how dangerous it is.

272
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,960
That's why I need another way.

273
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,400
I hope she won't be

274
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,230
as headstrong this time.

275
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,590
I hope she can yield this time.

276
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:20,980
You two

277
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,100
sure are two peas in a pod.

278
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,250
Why don't you go in to have the cake?

279
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,900
You just want to sit here?

280
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,020
A slice of cake costs 39 yuan.

281
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,250
I need to wash a lot of dishes

282
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,370
to earn it back.

283
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,340
When I think about it,

284
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,020
the cake doesn't taste delicious anymore.

285
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,340
Come on, my treat.

286
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:51,660
No, thanks.

287
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,730
I have to work in the restaurant tonight.

288
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,020
I won't eat now.

289
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:04,420
Sorry

290
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,250
for making you come here.

291
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,210
You shouldn't worry about me.

292
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,060
I'm fine now.

293
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,090
Take a day off.

294
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,900
It's my birthday today.

295
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,730
Please pity a foreign traveler like me

296
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,820
and take a day off

297
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,730
to celebrate my birthday.

298
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:27,900
Can you?

299
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,610
I already took a day off two days ago.

300
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,900
My manager isn't very happy now.

301
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:58,900
Sorry

302
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,250
that I can't celebrate your birthday with you.

303
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,130
How about this?

304
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,370
I'll buy you a cake

305
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,900
as your present.

306
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,580
What do you say?

307
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,250
Never mind.

308
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,330
I can't have your cake.

309
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,610
Then,

310
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,490
I'll go to work now.

311
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,580
I'll give you a lift.

312
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,090
My car is over there.

313
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,850
Wait for me here.

314
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:28,490
That pervert

315
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,850
just can't stop peeking.

316
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,450
Go.

317
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,540
Back to your seat.

318
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,370
Ms. Wen. The documents you need.

319
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,090
When you weren't here during noon,

320
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,900
Wu Songrong

321
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,970
took our inspection draft

322
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,610
and read it.

323
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:52,730
Get back to your work.

324
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:30,400
[Ruan Zhenzhen, apologize and I'll forgive you.]

325
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,970
[Su Wen]

326
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,220
[You recalled a message.]

327
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:13,670
[Su Wen recalled a message.]

328
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:38,570
[Ruan Zhenzhen: Su Wen, stop investigating.]

329
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,220
[Ruan Zhenzhen:
Otherwise, we're not friends anymore.]

330
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:39,070
[Su Wen: I'll think about it.]

331
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,970
You're on your phone now too?

332
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:00,540
Ruan.

333
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,130
I don't get it.

334
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,420
You have the look

335
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,580
and the body.

336
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,700
You can work anywhere.

337
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:09,730
Why do you

338
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,060
have to work here?

339
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,330
Where else can I work?

340
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,020
Give me some ideas.

341
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:21,730
I can find you a husband.

342
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,300
Girls like you

343
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,210
are in high demand.

344
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,820
You know,

345
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,660
some men just want

346
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,820
a pretty wife.

347
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,610
They don't care about anything else.

348
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,660
Tell me now.

349
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,210
Is there anything you look for in particular?

350
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,210
Hurry up now.

351
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,420
Thanks, Ms. Meng.

352
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,730
But I don't need a man now.

353
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,580
Come on, Ruan.

354
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,300
Just tell me.

355
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:08,450
Hey,

356
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,490
I found the car

357
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,730
under Wang Dali's name.

358
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,490
It's on the port.

359
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,130
I had a look.

360
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,610
The car was parked there.

361
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,700
For a long while, it seems.

362
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,090
Perhaps,

363
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,180
Xia Xinliang has already

364
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,250
left Nanzhou?

365
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:30,660
What's the matter?

366
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,130
Something's on your mind?

367
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,090
Ruan Zhenzhen again?

368
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:47,820
I see.

369
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:49,610
I

370
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,420
won't make a fool out of myself.

371
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,610
I'll leave you to drink alone.

372
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,250
It's your birthday today, isn't it?

373
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,090
16 February.

374
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,210
Yes, it's today.

375
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,300
Your father had an amazing hand

376
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:20,940
in a Mahjong game that day

377
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,900
and you were born.

378
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:24,610
All right.

379
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,330
Stop drinking alone here.

380
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,610
Let's go out and have fun.

381
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,020
Come on.

382
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:42,130
I see.

383
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,450
Give me your phone.

384
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,330
I don't have your trust at all?

385
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:56,970
Give me your phone.

386
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,250
I want to give you a present.

387
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,940
Let me use your face to unlock it.

388
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:51,850
Hello?

389
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:53,540
Hello?

390
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,490
Is this Ruan Zhenzhen?

391
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,450
Hello?

392
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:01,660
Hello?

393
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:03,970
Hey.

394
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:04,820
Hey.

395
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,730
Can you hear me?

396
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:07,820
Who are you?

397
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,060
Why do you have this phone?

398
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:11,820
Oh,

399
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,900
your friend here is wasted.

400
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,090
He passed out on the road.

401
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,020
Do you know him?

402
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,090
If you do,

403
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:16,540
come here

404
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,450
and bring him back.

405
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:18,850
It's unsafe to lie on the road

406
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:19,940
this late at night.

407
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:22,900
Give him the phone.

408
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,780
I want to talk to him.

409
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,330
He passed out.

410
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:27,300
I can't wake him up.

411
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,490
It's impossible to talk to him.

412
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,180
Come and pick him up.

413
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,970
Give me the address.

414
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,540
Okay. I'll hang up now.

415
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,330
Where are you going?

416
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,580
I'll take a day off.

417
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,210
You...

418
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,970
Your shift is almost over.
Why are you taking leave?

419
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,420
Gosh...

420
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:00,330
I can't believe this.

421
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,300
Why do you take leave when you're almost done?

422
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,090
That's not wise.

423
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,370
She's here.

424
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:39,900
She's here!

425
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,060
Are you dumb?

426
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,700
Anyone can call you

427
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,660
and lure you out.

428
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,580
Aren't you doing this on purpose?

429
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,180
After I got onto the taxi,

430
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,210
it dawned on me.

431
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,540
What dawned on you?

432
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,250
I'm listening.

433
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,700
There's no way the person

434
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,660
can unlock your phone.

435
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:58,970
It's for me?

436
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:02,940
What are you waiting for?

437
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,130
Waiting for me to snatch it?

438
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,540
It's for you.

439
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,450
Happy birthday.

440
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,610
Happy birthday.

441
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,580
You're so stingy.

442
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,370
You gave me a slice of cake

443
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,820
as my birthday present.

444
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,540
And it's your favorite cake.

445
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:31,660
I can't help but wonder.

446
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,700
Is the cake for you

447
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:33,850
or for me?

448
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,700
It's still a very expensive cake.

449
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,060
Let's share it together.

450
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,370
Share?

451
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:40,820
It's mine, isn't it?

452
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:42,580
I have to have a bite too.

453
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,090
What are you doing?

454
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,020
Stop staring.

455
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,090
Help me.

456
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:04,780
Why is it

457
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,940
so windy?

458
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,370
Dummy. Give it to me.

459
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:12,450
Come on. Hurry.

460
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:14,780
Stay still.

461
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:32,540
Make a wish now.

462
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:35,820
Since you gave me

463
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,330
such a huge cake,

464
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,020
I will give you the wish.

465
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,180
You'll make the wish.

466
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:46,580
Go ahead.

467
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:47,850
My birthday wish

468
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:48,970
always comes true.

469
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,090
Really?

470
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,020
Yes.

471
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:55,730
Hurry up.

472
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:56,700
The wind will put out the candle again.

473
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:33,250
Let's blow the candle out.

474
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,250
Together.

475
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,060
What wish did you make?

476
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,580
Guess.

477
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,340
You wish me to have a happy life?

478
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:11,820
I wish

479
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,940
to remain pretty forever.

480
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:37,940
(My dad too.)

481
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,890
He's as frugal

482
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,340
as Grandet.

483
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,290
I bought a new phone

484
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,010
and he nagged me for six months.

485
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:46,820
Do you like the phone?

486
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:48,130
Yes.

487
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,620
It's good for taking selfies.

488
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,100
My friends don't have to worry

489
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,620
about my retouching skills anymore.

490
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,940
Accompany me to buy one too.

491
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,820
Ms. Wen, you want a new phone?

492
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,700
For a friend.

493
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,340
Then you can order it online.

494
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,060
Which model do you want?

495
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:05,770
I'll order one for you.

496
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:07,250
Can you remember all of them?

497
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,340
Yes.

498
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,060
Why are you here?

499
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:14,730
Ms. Wen.

500
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,100
Let's walk around

501
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,140
to digest the food.

502
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,420
Zhang.

503
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,420
I can go with you.

504
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,140
Isn't it dangerous

505
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,180
for a girl to take a stroll

506
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,210
this late at night?

507
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,250
Zhang.

508
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:31,210
Zhang?

509
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:34,620
You'll be safer with me by your side.

510
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,730
Oh, Bai, Guan.

511
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,140
The young ones should stay active.

512
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:41,690
Indeed.

513
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,250
Su Wen is more vulnerable,
so she doesn't have to come.

514
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,290
Go rest in your room.

515
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,660
Mr. Songrong,

516
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,730
my health isn't amazing either.

00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,900
Impossible.

518
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,140
You're healthy. You should move a bit.

519
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:53,530
Come on.

520
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:54,010
Xiyao.

521
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:54,900
Let's hang out.

522
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,210
Go ahead.

523
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,060
You can rest up.

524
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,530
Hello?

525
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:12,660
Sure. Where are you?

[Voice Memos]

527
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,250
Mr. Qiu.

528
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:06,100
Miss Su.

529
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:08,010
Have a seat.

530
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,930
You found a nice place.

531
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,450
I've stayed in this hotel for a long time,

532
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,930
but I have never been here.

533
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,250
They serve good coffee here.

534
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:22,730
You should have one.

535
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:25,010
Water will do. Thank you.

536
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,100
Okay. Please wait for a moment.

537
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,380
I don't sleep well,

538
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:30,820
so I don't drink coffee.

539
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,620
What a shame.

540
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,180
Mr. Qiu, what can I help?

541
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:44,730
Miss Su.

542
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:47,820
Have you heard about

543
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,900
this cliche regarding our line of work?

544
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,620
What cliche?

545
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,140
People like us

546
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,140
have to be very careful

547
00:36:58,770 --> 00:36:59,900
with what they say.

548
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:01,770
In case someone is eavesdropping.

549
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,250
Some would even choose

550
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,490
to have conversations in a sauna.

551
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,420
A sauna?

552
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,820
Because that way, you can't hide anything.

553
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,450
Don't get me wrong,

554
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,820
Miss Su.

555
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:20,140
It's just a cliché.

556
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:21,900
Don't think too much of it.

557
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,340
We're like an open book to each other.

558
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,060
So, of course,

559
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,490
we won't have to take those extra measures.

560
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,060
However,

561
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,490
some gestures

562
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:40,690
are pretty much required.

563
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,450
Just cut to the chase.

564
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,180
You're straightforward, Miss Su.

565
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:26,140
In that case,

566
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,100
I won't beat

567
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,970
around the bush.

568
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:32,860
Name your price.

569
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:35,900
What price?

570
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:43,420
What can make you stop?

571
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,620
40 million yuan.

572
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:53,450
Can you give it to me?

573
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,340
It must be a joke, Miss Su.

574
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:10,660
Keen eyes.

575
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:12,060
It is indeed a joke.

576
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:16,820
Your water.

577
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:31,380
Mr. Qiu.

578
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:32,820
You didn't have to ask me

579
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:34,340
to come here.

580
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:35,420
It is out of my prerogative

581
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,380
how this investigation

582
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:37,900
will proceed.

583
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,900
And I don't get to decide

584
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,180
what will be revealed

585
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:43,380
and who will be implicated.

586
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:44,770
So save your breath.

587
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,060
Don't waste your time on me.

588
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:48,580
Also,

589
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:50,340
don't bother my friends.

590
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,580
Two million.

591
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:00,970
Miss Su.

592
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:03,140
Don't bite more than you can chew.

593
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,660
It's bad

594
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:07,210
for digestion.

595
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,620
Will two million yuan do?

596
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:15,730
It's a lot.

597
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,250
Should I thank you?

598
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,420
I know it's not enough.

599
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:57,970
"But it's expensive."

600
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,530
