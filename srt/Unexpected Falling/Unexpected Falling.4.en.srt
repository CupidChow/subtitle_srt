00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,760
Forget it.

4
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,190
We're already lucky enough

5
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,800
to have found

6
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,910
things about this person in the office.

7
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,270
This may be our clue.

8
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,830
If we find it,

9
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,440
it'll be easy to solve the rest of the problems.

10
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,440
Zhenzhen, have you found anything else?

11
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,510
Ruan Zhenzhen?

12
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,160
Ruan Zhenzhen.

13
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,080
Did you find

14
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,800
anything else in the office?

15
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,550
I only found this

16
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,550
in his office.

17
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,160
I couldn't attend to other things.

18
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,670
They won't let me see

19
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,190
the clients' details.

20
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,830
Also,

21
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,630
I noticed Youning's office

22
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,670
had been cleaned.

23
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,350
[You Gang]

24
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,110
Hello, Gang.

25
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,550
Zhenzhen.

26
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,800
It's me.

27
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,110
Zhenzhen,

28
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,910
Yu brought your ID

29
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,800
to me today.

30
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,800
She said you have a favor to ask.

31
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,550
I don't know if it slipped my mind

32
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,440
because

33
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,550
I couldn't remember what you asked.

34
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,800
[Zhenzhen]
What did you want me to do again?

35
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,270
I didn't ask you to do anything.

36
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,830
Then what about your ID?

37
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,830
Sorry.

38
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,910
I forgot to explain it to Yu.

39
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,190
It's like this.

40
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,190
When I went

41
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,270
to Youning's office

42
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,390
to collect his things today,

43
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,670
I suddenly

44
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,750
couldn't control my emotions.

45
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,750
I was afraid his co-worker

46
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,670
might see me break down.

47
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,360
So I thought of an idea

48
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:31,830
by asking his co-worker

49
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,030
to send my ID

50
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,110
to Yu.

51
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,030
It was actually to lure him away.

52
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,160
So I can calm myself down.

53
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,830
Zhenzhen,

54
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,270
so that's what happened.

55
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,630
I knew it.

56
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,390
I wouldn't have forgotten
if you had asked me for help.

57
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,190
How about this?

58
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,960
I'll send your ID back

59
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,880
to you tomorrow.

60
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,240
It's okay.

61
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,440
I can go and take it myself.

62
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,030
Thanks.

63
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,910
You don't have to thank me, Zhenzhen.

64
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,470
I'll hang up, then.

65
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,270
You can get back to what you're doing.

66
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,960
Did you hear that?

67
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,750
I wasn't trying to fool you

68
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,910
or hide anything from you, right?

69
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,800
That was

70
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,200
because Ruan Zhenzhen

71
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,110
behaved strangely.

72
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,350
I don't care.

73
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,160
You have to

74
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,070
take care of this.

75
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,830
Right now.

76
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,600
Hey, watch my tummy.

77
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,720
No matter what,

78
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,920
we have at least found

79
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,670
some clues about Xia Xinliang.

80
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,790
With his business license

81
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,670
and business address,

82
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,070
we can find him easily.

83
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,480
I'll be a little busy

84
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,440
these few days.

85
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,480
So you'll have to wait for a bit.

86
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,600
After that,

87
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,440
I'll look into Xia Xinliang's company

88
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,320
for you.

89
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,000
Are you listening to me?

90
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,160
I got it.

91
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,950
How long can you stay?

92
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,830
About a couple of days.

93
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,000
But I'm still not sure.

94
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,950
Go back inside.

95
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,720
I'll get going now.

96
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,790
Happy birthday.

97
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:08,880
Thank you.

98
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,920
(After so many years,)

99
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,040
(why didn't Ruan Zhenzhen)

100
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,270
(go out looking for a job?)

101
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,510
(She hasn't been in good health)

102
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,920
and is pretty reserved.

103
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,480
She's not good at dealing with people.

104
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,880
She used to work for some time back then.

105
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,830
But she couldn't get used to it.

106
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,000
So she resigned and stayed home.

107
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,640
I was too busy

108
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,720
to ask you

109
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,920
how you charge your lawyer fees.

110
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,270
About the fees,

111
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,270
I've already discussed them with Ruan Zhenzhen.

112
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,110
So you don't have to worry about it.

113
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,510
You've discussed it?

114
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,270
We made a deal.

115
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,110
So don't worry about it.

116
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,830
So what brings you

117
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,830
to Nanzhou this time?

118
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,830
An inspection.

119
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,550
Inspect what?

120
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,110
I get it. It's classified.

121
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,790
Don't you think

122
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,390
the arrival

123
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,200
of Xu Youning's gift tonight was odd?

124
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,040
Odd?

125
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,600
What's odd about it?

126
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,920
He placed a gift delivery service

127
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,600
one month in advance.

128
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,040
Isn't that odd?

129
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,390
Aren't there a lot of

130
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,480
gift delivery services like these now?

131
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,670
Why didn't he give it to her himself?

132
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,830
It was not like they were
in a long-distance relationship.

133
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,350
They were a married couple

134
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,640
who lived under the same roof.

135
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,480
Instead of giving the gift himself,

136
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,320
he took the long way to give it to her

137
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,760
by using the gift delivery service.

138
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,390
It seemed

139
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,670
he knew in advance

140
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,160
that he wouldn't be around to give it to her.

141
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,830
You're overthinking.

142
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,160
Maybe

143
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,070
he did that

144
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,270
to give her a surprise.

145
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,790
(I've called your second aunt)

146
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,270
to keep Youning's mom company

147
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,200
and talk to her.

148
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,040
Maybe she'll feel better.

149
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,160
It was too sudden.

150
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,600
It still feels

151
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,390
like a dream to me.

152
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,200
I wished I could wake up

153
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,600
and none of this had happened.

154
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,880
Dad, I'll get the door.

155
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,480
Second Aunt.

156
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,070
Zhenzhen.

157
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:04,880
Uncle.

158
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,110
-I sent my mom over.
-Brother-in-law.

159
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,000
Where's my sister?

160
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,550
In her room.

161
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,160
Uncle.

162
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,950
Come and take a seat.

163
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,480
Xiujuan.

164
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,920
There, there. Stop crying already.

165
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,070
Xiujuan, you're finally here.

166
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,040
It's only been a few days.

167
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,640
Look at the state

168
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,920
-you put yourself in.
-Sit down.

169
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,880
Don't you feel sorry for yourself?

170
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,230
What are we going to do

171
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,480
if you fall sick?

and restore the client's confidence.

Why did you suddenly come?

I saw the news online.

310
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:06,900
So I thought

311
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,060
you might face some trouble.

312
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,330
I happened to be working in the area.

313
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,060
So I dropped by to check on you.

314

I didn't expect that it actually happens.

315
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,180
Online?

316
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,820
What news is being circulated online?

317
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:26,490
Someone attempted

318
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,700
to jump off the Jinshang office building

319
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,580
and was live-streaming it.

320
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,360
They dragged Xu Youning

321
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,850
into this as well.

322
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,420
Who was that guy?

323
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,660
I have no idea.

324
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,660
But I think

325
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,420
they must be close.

326
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,130
Otherwise, he wouldn't show up in time.

327
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,020
-Am I right?
-You're right.

328
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:43,490
Did you see what he did just now?

329
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,580
He pulled her inside the building.

330
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:44,970
What does that tell you?

331
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:45,580
I saw that too.

332
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,660
It was a hero saving a damsel in distress.

333
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:47,090
Unbelievable.

334
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,420
-I'm sure they must be close.
-I know, right?

335
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,490
Gao Jun? Where's Zhenzhen?

336
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,090
Zhenzhen.

337
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,490
Are you okay?

338
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:31,210
I'm fine.

339
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,610
Since Su Wen is here,

340
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:37,780
I should go now.

341
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,130
I suggest you

342
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,020
stay home these few days.

343
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,330
Wait.

344
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:47,900
The reporters are still downstairs.

345
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,370
I think they're targeting you now.

346
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,610
Me?

347
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,730
That's what happened.

348
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,090
I happened to see it

349
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,090
downstairs.

350
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,660
It was a dispute

351
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,900
between Jinshang Capital

352
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,900
and its client.

353
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,780
So don't overthink.

354
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,490
Get some proper rest for these couple of days.

355
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,130
If someone looks for you,

356
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,660
don't respond to any questions.

357
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,180
Do you hear me?

358
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,660
I have a meeting. So I have to go now.

359
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,700
Can you stay here by yourself?

360
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:24,940
Yes.

361
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,210
Drink more water

362
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,450
and get some rest.

363
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,780
Call me if there's anything.

364
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:30,700
Do you hear me?

365
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,250
Okay.

366
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,610
How about this? Wait here for a bit.

367
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:57,700
If there's anything,

368
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,450
I'll call you.

369
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,700
You can leave after it's clear, okay?

370
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:02,330
What about her?

371
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:07,730
Just let her be.

372
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:17,940
Hello?

373
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,420
I'm afraid you still can't leave.

374
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,610
They're still out here.

375
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:22,940
Okay,

376
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:23,580
I understand.

Mr. Gao?

399
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,130
You're still here?

400
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,580
I wanted to leave,

401
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:44,420
but

402
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,300
a group of reporters is still downstairs.

403
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,660
Didn't Su Wen say

404
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,300
they are targeting me?

405
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,210
I didn't mean anything by it.

406
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,450
I think they're about to leave now.

407
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:55,780
I still have an appointment

408
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,660
with a client this afternoon.

409
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,820
Are you sure you'll be okay alone?

410
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,330
Yes.

411
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,730
I'll get going, then.

412
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,020
Call me if there's anything.

413
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,060
By the way,

414
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,210
there's one more thing

415
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,540
I still need to remind you about.

416
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,970
Everyone will be watching

417
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:30,900
your every move.

418
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,540
So don't wear anything conspicuous.

419
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,940
Lest they'll misunderstand.

420
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,210
Mr. Gao.

421
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,700
I don't understand what you mean.

422
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,660
I'll put it bluntly, then.

423
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,580
The watch you wore

424
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,370
last night

425
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,250
was the one

426
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:47,900
you bought

427
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,820
when we first met, right?

428
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,300
I may not know much about brands.

429
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:53,820
But it looks expensive.

430
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,540
You're obviously in a debt lawsuit.

431
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,820
Everyone thinks

432
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,180
you're hiding the money.

433
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,090
Why did you have to

434
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,210
buy such an expensive watch?

435
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,700
It was a gift you bought for yourself

436
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,300
on Valentine's Day?

437
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,060
You spend anyhow you want because you have money.

438
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,020
Mr. Gao,

439
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,060
just cut to the chase.

440
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,820
There's another possibility.

441
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,180
You didn't buy that watch.

442
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,130
You only went

443
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,780
to the shop to pick up

444
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,330
a watch that someone ordered in advance.

445
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,700
Am I right?

446
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,090
It was also ordered

447
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,210
by Xu Youning in advance.

448
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,210
Just like last night's

449
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,180
birthday gift.

450
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:39,820
Am I right?

451
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,450
I just don't understand

452
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,370
why would someone

453
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,780
give two watches

454
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,060
to his wife.

455
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,060
Gao Jun.

456
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,060
So what if he gave me two watches?

457
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:02,900
One is a Valentine's Day gift,

458
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,370
and the other one is a birthday gift.

459
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,700
Is that wrong?

460
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,420
No, it's not wrong.

461
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,370
So long you're happy.

462
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,420
Of course, I'm happy.

463
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,780
I'm very happy.

464
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,540
Mr. Gao,

465
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,820
what exactly do you want to say?

466
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,330
Don't you think you've crossed the line?

467
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:32,780
Ruan Zhenzhen,

468
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,250
do you really trust

469
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,420
your husband that much?

470
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,180
Why can't I trust

471
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,540
my husband?

472
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,490
All right, then.

473
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,730
You're right.

474
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,580
Married couples

475
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,180
should trust each other.

476
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,250
That's it, then.

477
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,210
I'll make a move first.

478
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,900
Get some proper rest.

479
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:58,820
See you around.

480
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,130
I had fun with a guy

481
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:12,730
in my previous assignment.

482
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:13,660
I trailed him for a long time.

483
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,420
He jumped over a wall to escape.

484
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,540
I saw him in a chatting group after that.

485
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,020
He was sure agile.

486
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:21,730
Hey, is that him?

487
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,130
Follow him.

488
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,580
It's him.

489
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,420
Hurry, take his photos.

490
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,580
Hey, you're in my way.

491
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:28,970
I...

492
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,020
He had already left.

493
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,850
Don't go!

494
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,820
What's your problem?

495
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,490
Don't get physical.

496
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,020
Ma'am, you managed to take a picture of him.

497
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,370
Can you share it with us?

498
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,940
-Share it with us.
-We're from the same field.

499
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,090
Otherwise, we can't deliver anything to our boss.

500
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:43,610
Oh, come on.

501
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:44,700
Don't go.

502
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,370
What's her problem?

503
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:46,850
What's wrong with her?

504
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,420
Let's go.

505
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,900
[Wu]

506
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,060
Hello?

507
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:13,820
Mr. Attorney.

508
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,490
This photo is worth 50,000 yuan, right?

509
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,300
How would you like to pay?

510
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,300
Cash or bank transfer?

511
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:19,730
Get lost.

512
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,250
You're cranky.

513
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,730
Did someone piss you off?

514
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,610
Here you go, Mrs. Xu.

515
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:38,900
Your husband sure treats you very well.

516
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:39,900
Mr. Xu Youning

517
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,850
wishes you a happy birthday.

518
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,090
[Customer: Mr. Xu Youning]
(I just don't understand)

519
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,820
(why would someone)

520
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,370
(give two watches)

521
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,580
(to his wife.)

522
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:47,820
Do you really trust

523
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,020
your husband that much?

524
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,820
Forty million yuan?

525
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:08,250
Yu,

526
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,850
did your brother really borrow

527
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,540
that much money?

528
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:12,780
The creditors

529
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,300
have filed a lawsuit.

530
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,700
That's the amount.

531
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:17,940
Tell me.

532
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,660
We're not short

533
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,370
of anything.

534
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:21,540
Why would he borrow

535
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,900
that much money?

536
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,370
Hey,

537
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,130
calm down.

538
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,700
Let's ask them first.

539
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:28,090
You two better

540
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,370
tell us everything.

541
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,820
Why didn't she tell us

542
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,060
about this lawsuit?

543
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:32,660
That's right.

544
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,370
She doesn't want you to worry.

545
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,330
That's why she asked us to keep it from you guys.

546
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,780
She refused to say anything.

547
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,130
So we're not clear either.

548
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,250
She doesn't know

549
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:41,940
what happened either.

550
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,490
Youning never told her anything.

551
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,900
Do you actually believe

552
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,090
what she said?

553
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,660
I'll just put it this way.

554
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,300
I'm sure she knows everything.

555
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,610
She deliberately keeps it a secret

556
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,180
and wants to keep the money to herself.

557
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,850
Don't talk nonsense.

558
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,420
How is it nonsense?

559
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,250
That's what everyone says.

560
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:04,130
At the company,

561
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,250
Youning was popular and competent,

562
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,420
and his superiors thought highly of him.

563
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,020
They all said he had a bright future.

564
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,130
Even if

565
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,850
he really borrowed the money,

566
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,370
I'm sure he used it

567
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:14,610
for investment.

568
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:15,940
That's right.

569
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,970
Youning is not a reckless child.

570
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,300
Of course.

571
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:19,850
How can we

572
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,250
not know our own kids?

573
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,700
Guys,

574
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,180
this is what I think.

575
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:28,850
About this matter,

576
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,450
it's not that we're accusing her of anything.

577
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,090
But I think

578
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:35,450
we should talk

579
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:36,850
to Ruan Zhenzhen.

580
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,450
This might sound harsh.

581
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,900
We were family only when Youning was alive.

582
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,300
But Youning is no longer with us.

583
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,060
They have no children too.

584
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,060
She'll move on

585
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,450
sooner or later.

586
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,580
I've seen this kind of thing a lot.

587
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,450
Besides,

588
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,730
our family

589
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:57,420
is not bad people.

590
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,850
We'll ask her about this

591
00:29:58,850 --> 00:29:59,970
when we meet her.

592
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:02,370
Then tell her to return the money
to the creditors.

593
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:03,940
If we stall this matter,

594
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,730
Youning will be blamed.

595
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:07,090
We must not

596
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,300
let her ruin Youning's reputation.

597
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:09,820
That's right.

598
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,450
Besides,

599
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,130
we haven't considered

600
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,330
how this will ruin

601
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,370
our family's name.

602
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,540
If we saw the money

603
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,490
and received some of it,

604
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,730
we could just let things go.

605
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:21,940
But we didn't get a single penny.

606
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,490
Why should we take the fall?

607
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,130
You're right.

608
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,370
Am I right, Brother-in-law?

609
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:29,060
Xu,

610
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,780
say something.

611
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,780
Why don't we

612
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,330
decide after we ask Zhenzhen

613
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,850
tomorrow?

614
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:40,540
We must ask her.

615
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,060
(Make sure I look pretty.)

616
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,580
(You look pretty already.)

617
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,900
(Xu Youning!)

618
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,580
(Okay, I'll start recording now.)

619
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:13,610
(Zhenzhen,)

620
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,420
(can you not be mischievous?)

621
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:17,900
(Nope.)

622
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,540
(Can you record it seriously?)

623
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,660
(Okay, I'll be serious.)

624
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,020
(How about this?)

625
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:02,660
She's not answering?

626
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:04,940
Maybe she didn't hear it.

627
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,660
She's not deaf.

628
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,970
How can she not hear her phone ring?

629
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:09,020
Or maybe

630
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,090
she doesn't want to answer

631
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:10,940
because it's your number.

632
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,580
I'll call again later.

633
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,490
Shen?

634
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:03,580
(Mrs. Xu,)

635
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,530
this is Ms. Shen from Tianyi Securities.

636
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:06,290
My name is Shen Nanqiu.

637
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:11,290
I like the watch you're wearing.

638
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,890
I've been wanting to get one for myself.

639
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,740
But the store said

640
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,100
I have to get it customized in Switzerland.

641
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,530
I can't wait any longer.

642
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,010
I must see Ruan Zhenzhen

643
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,290
and ask her about it.

644
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,980
No, wait.

645
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,580
Sit down.

646
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,420
Why are you so impulsive?

647
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:15,580
Listen.

648
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:17,730
You must not go

649
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,010
and find Ruan Zhenzhen.

650
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:19,820
You must make Ruan Zhenzhen

651
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,010
come here instead.

652
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,100
What's the difference?

653
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,340
Of course, there's a difference.

654
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,380
Brother-in-law,

655
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,340
call her again later.

656
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:32,660
Okay.

657
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,010
Just listen to me.

658
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:16,730
Let's go.

659
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:17,860
Check the data

660
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,450
with the reference list.

661
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,140
I need to make a call.

662
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:52,340
Are you okay?

663
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,010
I'm okay.

664
00:35:58,210 --> 00:35:59,180
Are you outside?

665
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:01,060
I felt anxious staying at home.

666
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,180
So I came out to take a walk.

667
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,490
Go back early, okay?

668
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,420
Be safe.

669
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:09,930
Okay.

670
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:58,020
[Lu Yang]

671
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:58,860
Okay.

672
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,490
Send these to the inspection team first.

673
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:01,420
We'll see what to do about the rest.

674
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,100
Okay.

675
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:16,690
Hello, Mrs. Xu.

676
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,380
What's the matter?

677
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:18,420
Lu Yang,

678
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,100
can I ask you something?

679
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,060
What is it?

680
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,770
I met Ms. Shen at the office
the day before yesterday.

681
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,530
How was

682
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:32,340
her relationship with Youning?

683
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:33,490
Ms. Shen?

684
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:35,450
They got along well.

685
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:37,690
Did they meet

686
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:39,690
each other frequently?

687
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,010
It should be all about work.

688
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:44,730
What's wrong, Mrs. Xu?

689
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,900
Nothing. I'm just curious.

690
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:49,250
I see.

691
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,490
Did they always meet each other in private?

692
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,820
Mrs. Xu, I'll be honest with you.

693
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,660
I don't know

694
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,490
if they met each other in private.

695
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,010
But Ms. Shen

696
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:11,340
is a tactful person.

697
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:13,420
Not only is she the manager of Tianyi Securities,

698
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:15,140
but she also holds several positions
in several companies.

699
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,620
If Xu met her,

700
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:18,770
it should be

701
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:19,900
work-related.

702
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,580
Are you still there, Mrs. Xu?

703
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,060
So

704
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,520
who asked for favors in terms of work?

705
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,250
Who asked for favors?

706
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:36,930
Did Youning ask

707
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,970
for more favors from Ms. Shen?

708
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:42,690
I think so.

709
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,420
Mrs. Xu,

710
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,290
why are you asking

711
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:50,770
about Ms. Shen?

712
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:52,820
It's nothing important.

713
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:53,930
I was just asking.

714
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,580
I won't be in your way, then.

715
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,820
You can get back to work now and thanks.

716
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,340
Okay, then.

717
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:30,730
This is Ms. Shen from Tianyi Securities.

718
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,060
This is my business card.

719
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:33,450
If you need any help

720
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,490
in the future,

721
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,340
you can come to me.

722
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,820
My ID?

723
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:45,450
Yes, your ID.

724
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:47,860
I have some free time this morning.

725
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,250
So I'm preparing your statement of defense.

726
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,820
[Civil Mediation Transcript]
I need the details of your ID.

727
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:52,490
Take a picture of the front and back

728
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:53,490
of your ID card

729
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:54,380
and send them to me.

730
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:59,250
Sorry, I was quite rude to you that day.

731
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:01,660
It's already in the past.

732
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,970
So let's not bring it up.

733
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,250
I don't have much time.

734
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:05,180
So I don't want to waste it

735
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,420
on meaningless things.

736
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,140
