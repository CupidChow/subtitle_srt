00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,190
Yes.

345
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,500
Now, let's discuss.

346
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,860
Who is impersonating Xu Youning

347
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,070
and what does he want?

348
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,980
Before we have this discussion,

349
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,710
I need to bring up an issue.

350
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:07,950
What is it?

351
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,340
It's

352
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,340
a confidential issue.

353
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,590
If you want to know it,

354
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,030
you will have to

355
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,950
kiss me.

356
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,220
I will pour the water

357
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:25,980
on your face now.

358
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,310
Fine then.

359
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,740
You're the one who doesn't want to know about it.

360
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,250
One day when you suddenly

361
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:32,980
find out about it,

362
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,550
you lose the right to blame me.

363
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,740
Whatever.

364
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:39,790
Let's

365
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:40,460
cut to the chase then.

366
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:46,260
The car

367
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,550
the man drove this morning.

368
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,710
I saw it before.

369
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,070
You too?

370
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:56,910
Too?

371
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,340
You have seen the car before?

372
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,550
Yes.

373
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,140
Outside Xinliang Manufacturer.

374
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,620
It was from that time
when we searched for Xia Xinliang.

375
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,260
I thought it was just

376
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:06,830
another random car,

377
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:07,460
so I didn't think too much of it.

378
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,430
Where did you see the car?

379
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,310
Same place as yours.

380
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,380
I went there last week

381
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:16,790
and saw the car

382
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,550
in front of the factory.

383
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:20,790
Why did you visit

384
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:21,710
the factory?

385
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,070
I have always

386
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,190
suspected

387
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,860
Xia Xinliang.

388
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,980
I wanted to look for him again,

389
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,500
but instead of him,

390
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,460
I found the car.

391
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:32,830
I see.

392
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:38,910
Can we check

393
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,140
its number plate?

394
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,380
The car owner is Wang Dali.

395
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,460
He works as a guard for the factory.

396
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,670
A guard

397
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:48,860
can't possibly own an expensive car like that.

398
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,030
It's not his car.

399
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,590
It was intentionally put under his name.

400
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,860
Xia Xinliang

401
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,860
must have something to do with this.

402
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,670
Yes.

403
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,750
[You're in Korea Now!]

404
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:23,220
Take over.

405
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:24,950
I need to pee.

406

[Xia Xinliang]

407
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,220
(Hi.)

408
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,860
(The number you have dialed is switched off.)

409
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,460
It's switched off.

410
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,220
No one switches off

411
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,500
their phones during the day.

412
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,190
It means the number

413
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:27,620
has been abandoned.

414
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,030
Hello?

415
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,750
Okay.

416
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,710
I'll come over now.

417
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,420
My client

418
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,710
wants me to be there.

419
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:55,470
I won't be with you this afternoon.

420

Be cautious.

421
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:58,950
Okay.

422
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,020
Don't waste food.

423
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,230
Speak now. Who asked you to spy?

424
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,300
I don't know.

425
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,260
I truly don't know.

426
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:30,350
You don't know?

427
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:31,950
He said he doesn't know.

428
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,590
Don't waste your time on him.

429
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,020
Just kill him

430
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,950
and ask the other person in the car.

431
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:37,870
Sure.

432
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,780
Qi, go to my car.

433
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:56,630
I'll go that side.

434
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:26,430
Qiu Zhijian told them to spy there.

435
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:27,350
They were there for a few days already.

436
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:29,110
It's that director of Jinshang.

437
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,630
He asked them to spy on you and Ruan Zhenzhen.

438
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,910
He also gave them a photo.

439
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:32,910
Here's the photo.

440
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,300
He asked them to locate this person.

441
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:38,870
He's Xu Youning.

442
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,390
This Xu Youning is dumb.

443
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:42,190
He can come back,

444
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,460
but he doesn't need to make a scene.

445
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,190
Shouldn't he be afraid that the police

446
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,110
catch wind of this and investigate?

447
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,220
Have you told them?

448
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:51,780
Make them leave

449
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,430
and stop spying.

450
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,500
You shouldn't doubt my techniques.

451
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,190
Those two rascals

452
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,540
ran with tails between their legs.

453
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:03,910
I thought you broke up

454
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:04,630
with Ruan Zhenzhen.

455
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,590
You two got back together again?

456
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,350
Listen to me.

457
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,300
Our identity is fake.

458
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,540
This relationship will not end well.

459

Don't get too invested

460
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,460
and get hurt.

461

I quite like it now.

462
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:23,500
Oh, you.

463
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,020
To put it nicely,

464
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:25,940

Playing with fire, you mean.

466
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,430
That's how people say it.

467

You get what I mean.

They are high school classmates.

472
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:39,110
Their social circles overlap.
This cover will blow sooner or later.

473
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,540
And you hang out

474
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,870
with Ruan Zhenzhen all the time.

475
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,540
You're flirting

with death.

00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,630
You helped Su Wen order a phone online?

516
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,910
Why did you retrieve the package

517
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:14,940
for her that morning then?

518
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,590
That morning,

519
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,190
Mr. Xu held a meeting suddenly.

520
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,870
Su Wen and I were heading to the meeting,

521
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,430
but she got a call

522
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,780
on the way.

523
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:34,350
She then told me to retrieve something

524
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,190
by the entrance

525
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:38,980
and to put it

526
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,910
inside her room.

527
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,110
She even gave me her room key.

528
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:47,980
And because of this,

529
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,500
I was late.

530
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,110
Zhang Xiyao.

531
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:55,740
Mr. Xu.

532
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,630
You remember, don't you?

533
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,300
What happened back then?

534
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,350
Well,

535
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:12,980
I received a complaint

536
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,070
that someone on my team

537
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:16,190
met with the inspected party in secret.

538
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,110
I gathered everyone

539
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:19,190
and held a meeting

540
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,390
to emphasize the importance of impartiality.

541
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,220
Zhang Xiyao arrived late that day.

542
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,780
Did you ask her why

543
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,630
she was late?

544
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,150
Su Wen told me

545
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,830
Zhang went to retrieve something for her.

546
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,540
And I do not know

547
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,940
what was in the box.

548
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,150
It's the phone you helped me order online.

549
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:44,350
Ms. Wen.

550
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,740
If I ordered the phone

551
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,830
for you,

552
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,780
there would be a bank transfer

553
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,390
because you would have to pay me.

554
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,150
You said the retailer had a two-week period

555
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,390
for price matching.

556
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:02,430
You said there would be a sale next week

557
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,390
and the price would change,

558
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:04,700
so you told me to wait

559
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,220
until the price was confirmed
before wiring the money to you.

560
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,590
According to the complaint,

561
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,070
other than the phone,

562
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,780
the box also contained

563
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:29,870
two 50g gold bars.

564
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,780
Where are they?

565
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:02,590
Hello?

566
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:05,350
Aren't you on leave now?

567
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:06,190
Why didn't you contact me at all?

568
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,260
Zhenzhen,

569
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,350
I gave the phone to you

570
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:09,260
last Saturday.

571
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,430
Did you throw away its box?

572
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,190
No.

573
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:13,780
Can you take a look

574
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,390
and see

575
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,390
if it contains two gold bars?

576
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:16,830
Gold bars?

577
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:19,300
Hold on.

578
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,460
I'll go home and check it for you.
