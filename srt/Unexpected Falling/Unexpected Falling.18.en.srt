00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,950
Do you think it's possible

4
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,800
that Ruan Zhenzhen is lying to you

5
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,160
and is misleading you?

00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,600
It's mainly for diabetes.

10
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,880
Take it orally

11
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,240
and you'll see your blood sugar level drop.

12
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,080
It lasts for a long time too.

13
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,720
And if a normal person takes it?

14
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,880
If a normal person takes it?

15
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,600
By mistake, you mean?

16
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,630
The side effect of this medication

17
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,520
includes hypoglycemia.

18
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,800
In the worst-case scenario,

19
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,320
it might induce a coma.

20
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,720
It's fatal.

(from the board.)

24
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,670
The inspection team wishes

25
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,880
to come to our company again.

26
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,520
It will be the same people.

27
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,190
But this time, it won't be a routine inspection.

28
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,670
It'll be a special inspection.

29
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,960
Their second visit here

30
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,240
indicates that they received orders

31
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,960
from the China Securities Regulatory Commission.

32
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,110
They are doubling down on the auditing measures.

33
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,360
Special inspection?

34
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,000
On what?

35
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,750
Based on the content they are inspecting,

36
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,270
I suspect

37
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,440
they are looking into Anhe Travel.

38
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,720
But more details

39
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,910
will be made apparent when we meet them

40
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,000
and when we ask them

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,110
what they need.

42
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:58,550
You

43
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,190
will follow up on this.

44
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
You'll decide which documents

45
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,030
to give them.

46
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,020
Okay.

47
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,800
If something serious happens,

48
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,630
let me know at once.

49
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,480
Oh, right.

50
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,110
Will Su Wen

51
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,440
be on the inspection team?

52
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,550
Yes.

00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,670
Okay.

Qiu.

55
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,160
You left a mess

56
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,760
on the Anhe Travel case.

57
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,230
There is nothing we can do,

58
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,790
and the company is now

59
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,110
in a predicament.

60
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,920
Sir.

61
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,640
Sorry.

62
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,000
But I...

63
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,920
Don't bring up the past,

64
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,670
but please,

65
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,350
don't repeat the same mistake.

66
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,550
Noted, sir.

67
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,550
Qiu.

68
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,550
Whenever we do something,

69
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,040
we have to be fully prepared.

70
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,720
Plan ahead.

71
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,430
I hope you

72
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,350
can retain these two words.

73
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,390
Look.

74
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,790
The view here is breathtaking.

75
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,920
I'll let you stay here

76
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,440
to admire the view.

77
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,390
And to think everything through.

78
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,550
Something is imminent.

79
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,880
You're running out of time.

80
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,070
It's almost done.

81
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:47,830
Here you go.

82
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,320
Mr. Qiu.

83
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,830
You can have a look.

84
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,950
This is...

85
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,790
The inspection team

86
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,000
needs some documents here.

87
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,230
Hi, Mr. Qiu.

88
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,480
Hi.

89
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,200

Mr. Youning's office.

93
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,160
And these cases

94
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,040
were under Mr. Youning's supervision.

95
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,440
Ms. Su.

96
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,880
I heard you are

97
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,440
an ex-classmate of Mr. Youning?

98
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,670
What a coincidence.

99
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,440
I am not his ex-classmate.

100
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,160
I am his wife's ex-classmate.

101
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,600
It makes no difference.

102
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,230
You're close to them.

103
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,480
Regardless of the proximity
of our relationship,

104
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,790
I will proceed with fairness.

105
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,670
If you have any concerns,

106
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,230
please raise them to the inspection team.

107
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,910
Let me know

108
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,910
if you need anything else.

109
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,400
Thank you.

110
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,440
I'll leave you guys be then.

111
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,200
I'll meet with Mr. Xu.

Ms. Wen.

113
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,320
Do you think

114
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,350
Mr. Qiu is up to something?

115
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,960
He was obviously trying to pretend

116
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,000
that he's close to you.

117
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,440
It's almost as if he wants everyone to know it.

118
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,790
Get to work.

Yes, a Nanzhou local number.

Boss, she's out.

She didn't use her car.

131

No idea where she is going.

160

Wow.

00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,710
in front of Ruan Zhenzhen.

176
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,400
He's not suitable for our case anymore.

177
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,590
What should we do about Ruan Zhenzhen then?

178
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,080
She's still lying to us

179
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,960
at this point.

180
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,080
We need a solution.

181
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'll handle it.

182
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,440
Have you found the restaurant?

183
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,400
Yes.

184
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,440
It's close to Ruan Zhenzhen's place,

185
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,000
but the uniform

186
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,350
is different.

187
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,520
It's not the same color.

188
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,790
The waiters there

189
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,960
wear a red uniform.

190
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,590
Send me its location.

191
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,670
Location.

192
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,590
Location.

193
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,550
Is that dish ready?

194
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,400
Yes.

195
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,150
That table. Hurry.

196
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,880
How many people, sir?

197
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,640
Do you have a reservation?

198
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:47,910
No.

199
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,110
Are your friends here?

200
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,080
No.

201
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,230
Does the restaurant
have another branch somewhere?

202
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,960
No, this is our only restaurant.

203
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,640
How many are you, sir?

204
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,960
How many are you, sir?

205
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,080
Just one.

206
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,960
Here, please.

207
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,000
Where is the toilet?

208
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,760
How many are you, sir?

209
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,760
Do you have a reservation?

210
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,670
Hey!

211
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,440
You've arrived?

212
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,230
Sure. Wait for me back home.

213
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,230
I'll go back soon.

214
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,440
I'll be right back once I get off work.

215
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:51,960
Okay.

216
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,110
I know. I know.

217
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,350
Get me something delicious.

218
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,840
Thank you.

219
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,470
Wait for me.

220
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,670
I'll go home once I'm done.

221
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,320
Hi, mister.

222
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,440
How may I help?

223
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,230
Nothing. I'm just looking around.

224
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,590
This is the kitchen area.

225
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,470
You can't come in.

226
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,110
Sorry.

227
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,350
Put it down. Let me handle it.

228
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,280
Chef Wang, your knife is ready.

229
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,550
Okay.

230
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,960
Quick. Bring it over here.

231
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,760
Ms. Meng.

232
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,400
A guy followed

233
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,350
you

234
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,110
to the door.

235
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,880
A guy followed me?

236
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,200
A guy?

237
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
Is he hot?

238
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,440
So so. Just normal.

239
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,280
No, thanks.

240
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,170
[Haozailai Seafood and Fujian Cuisine]

241
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:19,740
Let me give you a hand.

242
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,030
Here.

243
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,550
It's an extra plate of noodles.

244
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,620
I have been keeping watch. No one has touched it.

245
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,220
You can have it as supper.

246
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,140
Zhenzhen.

247
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,460
Where do you live?

248
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,590
Let me give you a lift.

249
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:34,860
It's fine.

250
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,950
My place is close to the restaurant.

251
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:36,830
I can walk back.

252
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,260
Don't worry. Let me help you.

253
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:38,910
Hop on.

254
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,190
I'm fine.

255
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,340
I'm single.

256
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:44,980
What are you doing?

257
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,220
I mean

258
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,860
I'm single,

259
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,500
so if you ride with me,

260
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,910
no one will be jealous,

261
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:54,860
and no one will get the wrong idea.

262
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,910
Zhenzhen.

263
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:15,980
My friend came to pick me up.

264
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,220
See you.

265
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,380
Ride safe.

266
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,500
So the creep who harassed you

267
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,790
is the friend you're meeting up with tonight?

268
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,380
Why are you here?

269
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,310
Have you eaten?

270
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:36,790
Yes.

271
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,220
Are you free tonight?

272
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,430
I haven't eaten.

273
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,220
Let's go eat together.

274
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,550
Sir, all your orders are here.

275
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,100
Thank you.

276
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:16,740
Bon appétit.

277
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,190
I ordered way too much.

278
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,190
You can have some.

279
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,430
This restaurant is not bad.

280
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:35,860
The food is not too heavy.

281
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,100
Give it a try.

282
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,260
You're already here anyway.

283
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,670
Why did you ask me to come out

284
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:43,670
this late at night?

285
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:52,790
Gao Jun.

286
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,790
Did you go to court

287
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,190
to pay the authentication fee?

288
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,140
When is the court session?
Did they give you a date?

289
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:05,340
No.

290
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,340
They told me to wait until further notice.

291
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,030
Why?

292
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,030
Nothing.

293
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,860
I'm going back to Beiling.

294
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,710
The law firm assigned me a new case,

295
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,430
so I might not be able

296
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,670
to handle your case.

297
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,710
And I might not be free

298
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,710
during the day of the hearing.

299
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,030
I thought it was something serious.

300
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,950
We already accepted the fact

301
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,910
that you won't appear in court with me.

302
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,260
So you're done with your case here?

303
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:23,980
How did it go?

304
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,460
Let's simulate it.

305
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,100
Simulate what?

306
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,140
The hearing.

307
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,260
We will go through what the judge

308
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,790
and the other attorney

309
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,550
might ask you.

310
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,980
So that even if

311
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,860
I can't come with you,

312
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,590
you can still

313
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,340
hand your ground on your own.

314
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,500
Here?

315
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,130
We can go to another place.

316
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,260
A late-night trip to a beach

317
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,070
makes me nervous.

318
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,260
Let's begin.

319
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,670
Ruan Zhenzhen, are you employed?

320
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:55,590
No.

321
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,380
You've always been unemployed? For how long?

322
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,590
Eight years.

323
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:00,500
So,

324
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:01,460
your sole income

325
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,340
was dependent

326
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,740
on Xu Youning, correct?

327
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,460
Correct.

328
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,980
Who managed the finances of the household?

329
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,030
Xu Youning.

330
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,790
Were you and your husband, Xu Youning,

331
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:12,910
on good terms?

332
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,260
The judge will ask me that question?

333
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,340
The judge won't,

334
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,190
but the other party's attorney

335
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,190
might.

336
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,070
He will argue

337
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,790
that the relationship between spouses

338
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,260
has a direct link to the financial situation

339
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,220
of the household.

340
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,030
Can you answer

341
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:27,790
my question now?

342
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,950
Were you and your husband, Xu Youning,

343
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,610
on good terms?

344
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,790
Yes.

345
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,980
Has he given you any expensive gifts?

346
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:39,910
No.

347
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:40,790
You lied.

348
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:42,950
From what we gathered,

349
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,030
on 5th January,

350
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,620
Xu Youning ordered a female wristwatch

351
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,430
worth up

352
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,430
to 158,000 yuan

353
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,030
from Chopard Boutique.

354
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,380
On 14th February,

355
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,340
you went to the boutique to collect the watch.

356
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,070
Gao Jun.

357
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,670
You know the truth

358
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:55,380
behind the wristwatch.

359
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:56,500
But the judge doesn't.

360
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,030
Are your questions

361
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,460
pertinent to this case?

362
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,030
All conjugal expenses

363
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,070
are pertinent to this case.

364
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,830
Xu Youning ordered the wristwatch,

365
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,430
but he didn't tell me about it.

366
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,220
On 14th February,

367
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,310
the staff of Chopard Boutique

368
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:28,860
called

369
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,790
Xu Youning's phone

370
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,220
and that is how I learned of its existence.

371
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,100
Besides, the watch

372
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,190
wasn't for me.

373
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,070
The clock face was engraved

374
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,460
with another woman's name.

375
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,260
Do you have any other questions?

376
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,620
Do you know the plaintiffs?

377
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:48,830
No.

378
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:49,710
None of them?

379
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,710
None of them.

380
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,790
Xu Youning never mentioned them?

381
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,790
Never.

382
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:53,740
Did you know that Xu Youning

383
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,980
took out a loan for investment?

384
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,620
I did not.

385
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,500
I don't see the need to continue this.

386
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,310
No matter what they

387
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:05,790
throw at me,

388
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,380
I'll just answer honestly.

389
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,550
I'll tell them Xu Youning

390
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,460
was having an affair.

391
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,710
I'll tell them he took and misused

392
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:13,460
my ID card.

393
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:14,790
He forged my signature

394
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,210
and gave me a fake watch

395
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,140
as my birthday gift.

396
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,790
Where is Xu Youning's money?

397
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,740
I'm sure you know.

398
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,260
I do not know.

399
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,980
Didn't Xu Youning

400
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:39,590
leave you

401
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,380
anything?

402
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,220
Such as?

403
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,100
Ledgers? A USB?

404
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,340
An external hard disk?

405
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,710
You mean what Lu Yang was looking for?

406
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:50,980
None.

407
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:57,980
Gao Jun.

408
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,070
Even until now

409
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,620
you still don't believe me.

410
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,380
It doesn't matter if I trust you or not.

411
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,740
The thing is,

412
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,030
if you don't have anything to prove yourself,

413
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,100
they won't let you off the hook.

414
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,830
You either give them the money

415
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,100
or the evidence.

416
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:15,950
You have to hand over

417
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:16,830
one of them.

418
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,590
I don't have them. I don't know anything!

419
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,950
Do whatever you want.

420
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,100
I refuse to believe

421
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,310
that if I don't have these two items,

422
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,380
I'll lose this case.

423
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,790
What if you do lose this case?

424
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,980
Then I'll admit defeat.

425
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,220
So what if I lose this case?

426
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,460
It's not the end of the world.

427
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,220
I can still lead a good life.

428
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,460
How?

429
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:38,550
Like how you're leading your life now?

430
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,950
And what about my life now?

431
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,950
My life is great.

432
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:42,740
Great?

433
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,260
Then why didn't you tell me

434
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:45,980
the truth?

435
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:47,950
You were working in the restaurant,

436
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,220
but you told me you went to meet up with a friend.

437
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,860
Is this your great life?

438
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:52,980
I did not commit any crime.

439
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,380
I feed my tummy with my bare hands.

440
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,590
What is this if not a great life?

441
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,380
If you just want to have a full tummy,

442
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,190
you don't have to take up such a menial job.

443
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,380
Sometimes, you have to be harsh

444
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,550
towards Ruan Zhenzhen.

445
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,790
Maybe that will force Ruan Zhenzhen
to tell the truth.

446
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,500
Do you agree with me?

447
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,340
I can show you the way.

448
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,860
I can give you a house

449
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,740
and a car.

450
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,070
They won't be under your name.

451
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:21,790
I'm sure you know why.

452
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,140
But you will have the right of use.

453
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:24,710
I will give you

454
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,740
20,000 yuan as your allowance every month.

455
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,590
Your life can still be the same.

456
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,260
You don't have to work.

457
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,620
Whenever I'm in Nanzhou,

458
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,460
you'll keep me company.

459
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,740
When I'm not here,

460
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:35,860
you can go out

461
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,950
and do whatever you want.

462
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,830
And one day,

463
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,460
if I have a girlfriend

464
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,140
or get married,

465
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,460
this relationship will be terminated.

466
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,790
But you get to keep the house and the car.

467
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,220
Gao Jun.

468
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,500
Who do you think I am now?

469
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,380
To put it nicely,

470
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,380
you'll be my lover. What do you think?

471
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,220
Think it through.

472
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,500
If you can't give the money back

473
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,070
or hand over the evidence,

474
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,460
the life I can offer you

475
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,860
will be your best option.

476
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,220
Did something happen?

477
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:19,620
Nothing.

478
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,100
Then why

479
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,790
are you humiliating me here?

480
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,140
I merely point out

481
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,500
the problems you're facing.

482
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,710
How is that a humiliation?

483
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,620
You thought I came

484
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,620
to help you

485
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:38,980
because I needed a favor from you?

486
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,140
It's because I like you.

487
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:46,740
You like me?

488
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:48,710
Yes.

489
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,100
I like you.

490
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,460
What are you doing?

491
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,260
Your only way out

492
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,590
is what I proposed to you

493
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,100
just now.

494
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,670
You don't have to work

495
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:17,950
in the restaurant anymore.

496
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:18,590
You can...

497
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:33,860
So?

498
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:35,860
Have you made up your mind?

499
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,740
You have no right to humiliate me like that.

500
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,500
Just because

501
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:47,780
you like me?

502
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,260
Gao Jun.

503
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,780
I don't know

504
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,710
what turned you into this monster,

505
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:57,950
but do bear in mind

506
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,020
that I am a human.

507
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,350
So please

508
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:07,020
treat me like one

509
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,290
and treat yourself like one too.

510
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,070
You want to live like a human?

511
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,020
Then have a good look

512
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,140
at yourself.

513
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,020
I'm happy with it.

514
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,950
I want to live like this. What's wrong with that?

515
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,420
I earn money with my labor.

516
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,350
I feed myself!

517
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,590
Gao Jun.

518
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,140
What happened to you?

519
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,140
What exactly are you up to?

520
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:16,740
Like I said,

521
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:19,910
I

522
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:22,540
like you.

523
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,780
When will the boss come back?

524
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:20,940
I want to see him

525
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,070
before I leave.

526
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,150
Seriously?

527
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,630
He's not one of us.

528
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,110
You feel attached to him now?

529
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,260
Boss.

530
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,940
Tell your company

531
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,220
to close the case.

532
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,020
Tell them I quit.

533
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:50,830
Also, Ruan Zhenzhen

534
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,980
has no idea about the money and the thing.

535
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,350
So don't waste your time on her.

536
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,500
What's going on?

537
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:11,940
Great.

538
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:12,870
Does that mean we three

539
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:13,740
can leave too?

540
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:14,940
We should have left long ago.

541
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,670
A bunch of men

542
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,940
is trying to take advantage of a poor widow.

543
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,500
This feels wrong.

544
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,540
Boss.

545
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,460
Calm down.

546
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,740
I can report it to them,

547
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:32,660
but you should wait

548
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,190
until the company

549
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,670
approves your resignation.

550
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,670
You can wait

551
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,780
on your own.

552
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,190
But...

553
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,220
But

554
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,940
you're walking away just like that.

555
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,460
What if the company doesn't agree

556
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,300
to let you go?

557
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,590
Besides, we already took

558
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,260
their deposit.

559
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,020
We're violating the clause here.

560
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,020
Refund them double the deposit then.

561
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:52,630
But...

562
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,350
I have made up my mind.

563
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,540
Yu.

564
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,190
Yu.

565
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,220
You Gang left just now?

566
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,980
He came back last night?

567
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,220
Why didn't you make him stay

568
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,070
and talk to him?

569
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,430
You can't keep giving him

570
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:35,740
the cold shoulder.

571
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:41,630
Yu.

572
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,500
Well,

573
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,070
you have to ask him

574
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:46,740
about

575
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,070
the one million yuan.

576
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,740
And this house too.

577
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,870
If he did mortgage

578
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:51,590
this house,

579
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,980
would someone come to us to collect debts?

580
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,780
Mom.

581
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,260
Can you just

582
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,590
leave me alone?

583
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,220
I'm hungry.

584
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,540
Cook for me, will you?

585
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,980
I have to go to work later.

586
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:37,910
Okay.

587
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,460
I'll cook for you.

588
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,020
Ma.

589
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:34,070
I'm in a pickle now.

590
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,740
I know you won't help me,

591
