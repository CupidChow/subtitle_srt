00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,960
This notebook...

174
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,880
You take it.

175
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,910
The chairman said

176
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,350
to hand it to the sales department to check

177
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,880
if it contains

178
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,960
any business-related content.

179
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,230
Who could've done it?

180
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,000
If there is business-related information,

181
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,590
then...

182
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,840
Do you still have to ask?

183
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,000
If there's related content,

184
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,200
find out what it's about.

185
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,880
Report any important findings

186
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,470
immediately.

187
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,000
This must not result
in any losses for the company.

Yes, got it.

There's no end to this.

193
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,150
They're either clamping the car
or puncturing the tires.

194

195

have no shame.

00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,840

197
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
Yes, she's doing great.

198
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,710
You know her temper.

199
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,760
She wears her heart on her sleeve.

200
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,400
But she gets over it quickly.

201
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,550
No hard feelings.

202
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:50,960
As for you,

203
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,710
don't let it get to you.

204
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,030
Zhenzhen, I have something else to do.

205

I'm making a move.

206
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,320

207
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,790
Call me if there is anything.

208
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,280
Okay.

209
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,000
You go ahead.

210

211
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,960
Please fix the car.

212
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,590
I'll be nearby.

213
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,350
I'm off, Zhenzhen.

214
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,080
Hello, Xiucai. What's up?

215
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,590
Your tire

216
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,440
cannot be patched.

217
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:25,790
Then what should we do?

218
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,150
Change the tires. Both wheels.

219
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,000
How much is that?

220
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,880
You're Gang's relative, right?

221
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,470
I won't charge you more.

222
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,280
Two tires. I can do it for 1,000.

223
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,320
Sorry, sir.

224
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,280
Forget about fixing it.

225
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,760
Sorry to have troubled you.

226
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,110
Please put the tires back.

227
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,550
What about...

228
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,520
I make it cheaper? 800?

229
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,000
It's not about the cost.

230
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,910
I don't want to fix it anymore.

231
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,880
Sorry.

232
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,110
Alright.

233
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,030
We won't fix it.

234
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,670
But

235
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,760
you have to pay me 100 yuan for my man-hours.

236
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,200
Thank you.

237
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,110
I'll put the tires back

238
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,110
for you.

239
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,030
I checked.

240
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,150
She bought it in the morning with cash.

241
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:04,960
Cash?

242
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,230
Yes, cash.

Your qualifications are sufficient.

you've not had a job for 10 years.

255

Miss Ruan.

256
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,900
I'll be honest with you.

257
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,290
Your age

258
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,300
is too old to be a programmer.

259
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,460
As for something like

260
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,220
a system architect or algorithm engineer,

261
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,420
you lack experience.

262
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,100
Currently, the more popular jobs

263
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,940
are in big data cloud computing.

But your background is not in that.

267
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,780
So...

268
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,500
How about changing career paths?

269
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,260
Such technical positions

270
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,260
have stiff competition.

271
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,180
It's constantly advancing too.

272
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,380
With your condition,

273
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,660
it'll be hard to return to the industry.

274

What other industry do you suggest?

275
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,100
The biggest problem is

276
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,540
that you haven't had a job for the past 10 years.

277

Will you consider domestic work?

It's a no for domestic work.

is suitable.

298
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,460

This is how it is.

301

Take this as a friendly reminder.

302
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,180
Right now, you're not the one picking a job.

303

304
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,100
To be honest,

305
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,540
even for domestic work,

306
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,700
you'd be an unfavorable candidate.

307
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,100
Because female homeowners nowadays

308
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:02,940

309
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,420

You understand, right?

313
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,420
Okay then.

314
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,660
You can think about it.

315
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,500
I won't see you out.

316
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,380
Okay.

317
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,140
Call me if there is anything.

318
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:21,580
Sure.

319

330
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,460
an advantage many others do not.

331
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,300
I'm going to cut to the chase.

332

Don't... don't get me wrong.

I'm talking about a decent job.

337

put on your best smile

339

When required, go on business trips with them.

340
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,100
The salary?

341
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,780
The monthly salary starts at 15,000.

342

for buying clothes and makeup.

00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,580
And, if you can handle alcohol,

344
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,540
you get 5,000 more.

345
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:05,780
Can you do that?

346
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,980
If you think you can,

347
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,180
you can sign the contract right away.

348
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,540
What a pity.

349
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,380
Hello?

350
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,780
I can't go over today either.

351
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,900
My supervisor wants me to stay back.

352
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,260
What's the situation with you?

353
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,140
Any updates from the court?

354
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,300
No.

355
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,580
Don't fret.

356
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,780
It will probably take a few days.

357
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,420
Court proceedings take time.

358
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,940
You don't have to worry about me.

359
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,260
Watch after your own health.

360
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,220
Make sure you don't exhaust yourself.

361
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,340
I know what I'm doing. I can handle it.

362
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,380
But my line of work

363
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,580
is never a walk in the park.

364
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:57,980
Be it man or woman,

365
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,260
we're all just minions.

366
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,340
That's a good thing, no?

367
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,900
You think so?

368
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,100
It's fulfilling.

369
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,580
Unlike me.

370
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,100
I turned myself

371
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,260
into a useless piece of trash.

372
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,300
Nobody wants anything to do with me.

373
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,020
That's funny.

374
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,540
Who would want this sort of fulfillment?

375
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,700
If I didn't

376
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,860
have to make money to get a new kidney,

377
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,580
I'd have retired and lived a carefree life.

378
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,460
Zhenzhen?

379
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:38,940
I'm listening.

380
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,060
Have you tried

381
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,220
looking for Xia Xinliang in secret?

382
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,700
I tried calling.

383
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,380
He said the money

384
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,100
was all loans.

385
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,580
Why would a shell company have loans?

386
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,700
It's just a bluff.

387
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,340
I asked to meet up.

388
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,620
He said he was out of town.

389
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,100
He will be back next week.

390
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,300
That's clearly an excuse.

391
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,860
Just wait for me.

392
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,420
Our audit is about to finish.

393
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,900
I'll help you investigate it.

394
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,780
Do you think

395
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,780
the money is with Xia Xinliang?

396
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,460
It's probable.

397
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,980
Think about it.

398
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,860
You discovered this lead

399
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,580
in the client information

400
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,860
kept in Xu Youning's office.

401
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,900
Jinshang Capital is a private equity.

402
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,980
There are strict criteria to be accepted.

403
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,420
Since this Xia guy

404
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,900
is one of the company's clients,

405
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,060
that means his account

406
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,940
had at least

407
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,140
one million in it.

408
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,100
But Xia Xinliang's factory

409
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,220
is a shell company.

410
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,260
That's where the problem lies.

411
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,620
A shell company

412
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,580
was able

413
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,380
to become a private equity client.

414
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,220
Think about it.

415
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,580
This could very well be

416
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,500
the missing piece.

417
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:47,660
Ms. Wen.

418
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,060
I noticed Wu Songrong

419
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,940
secretly watching you just now.

420
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,620
Being all sneaky.

421
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,780
Who knows what he's up to?

422
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,100
I'm here.

423
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,540
Sorry.

424
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,660
I was at the finance department.

425
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,620
Well?

426
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,900
Are you rushing to go back?

427
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,580
Mr. Songrong.

428
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,940
Do you have goji berries

429
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,180
steeping in your flask?

430
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,260
Young lady.

431
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,900
You think I don't get it?

432
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,620
You're calling me out as a middle-aged man.

433
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,020
Am I right?

434
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,140
Let's go.

435
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,060
Don't make Mr. Xu wait.

436
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,860
I'll do it.

437
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,340
How can I not feel anxious, bro?

438
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,140
You made it sound like

439
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:34,780
it was foolproof.

440
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,380
Follow the bookmaker and your money will grow.

441
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,860
There wouldn't be any risks.

442
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,660
Playing them for a sucker.

443
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,660
You said that, didn't you?

444
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,940
That was just a few days ago.

445
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,580
Now you're asking me to throw more money into it?

446
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:43,940
Stop yelling.

447
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,420
If you can't make up the deficit,

448
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,900
you'll be forced to close the position.

449
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,020
Yelling at me won't change anything.

450
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,220
Closing the position?

451
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,100
What about the one million plus

452
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:57,900
I had invested?

453
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,620
There's nothing I can do.

454
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,260
Once the position is closed,

455
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,900
there won't be much left of it.

456
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,660
Xiucai.

457
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,380
Xiucai, I'm not blaming you.

458
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:08,780
Xiucai.

459
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,900
It's fine if I don't make any money.

460
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,260
But I can't lose the capital.

461
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,380
I can't lose even one cent from the capital.

462
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:15,860
The capital

463
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,100
wasn't just the money
my parents saved for their retirement,

464
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,940
but I also mortgaged

465
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,420
my house.

466
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,100
Xiucai.

467
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,700
I cannot

468
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,780
lose any of the capital!

469
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,460
-Go, go. Get out.
-Get off the car.

470
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,540
I must

471
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,580
get the capital back, you hear me?

472
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,420
What are you doing?

473
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,260
Xiucai, you better think of a solution.

474
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:34,700
If you had

475
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,220
broken my neck,

476
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:37,660
you'd be worried

477
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,780
about more than a million.

478
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:39,740
If I

479
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,740
don't teach you a lesson today,

480
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,580
I'll have trouble maintaining order.

481
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,380
Beat him up!

482
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,260
Boss, it's his phone.

483
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:07,900
Your phone's ringing.

484
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:12,940
Answer it.

485
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:20,540
Tsk.

486
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,820
Hello?

487
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,700
Yes, dear.

488
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,140
What is it?

489
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,460
Really?

490
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,340
You think I'm lying to you?

491
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:38,460
Yu.

492
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,220
Show the photos to your aunt.

493
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,660
Yu took photos.

494
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,020
Look.

495
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,540
It was at the mall.

496
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,780
She was carrying that big bag.

497
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,020
That brand is very expensive.

498
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,980
That good-for-nothing...

499
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,180
Gosh.

500
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,660
Who is that?

501
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:02,780
You Gang.

502
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:05,780
Aunt.

503
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,780
Hey, come in.

504
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,460
Mom, Yu.

505
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,420
What took you so long?

506
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:12,900
Something happened at the stall.

507
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,340
Yu was quick-thinking

508
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,620
and took photos of her.

509
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,100
Even if we confronted her,

510
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,100
do you think she'll admit it?

511
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:19,940
Right.

512
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,700

00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,780
We don't know her stance.

681
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,340
It's better

682
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,220
to resolve this amicably.

683
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,940
We are civilized people.

684
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,420
We'll talk civilly.

685
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,060
Yes.

686
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,060
Let's settle down.

687
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:46,460
Sit here.

688
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,500
-It's okay. You sit.
-Sit here.

689
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,020
You can sit here.

690
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:48,500
Sit down here.

691
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,660
Come on, sit down.

692
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,380
If Xia Xinliang's name can be found

693
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,420
on the bank statement,

694
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,780
does that mean

695
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,740
I can use it as proof

696
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,380
to sue Xia Xinliang?

697
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,620
You can sue him,

698
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,260
but it might result in a loss

699
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:10,860
due to insufficient evidence.

700
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,300
It's okay to lose.

701
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,220
At least

702
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,420
the court will look into Xia Xinliang.

703
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,210
Then we could at least meet him.

704
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,260
You want to see Xia Xinliang?

705
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,060
Su Wen said Xia Xinliang is the key.

706
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,260
I went to look for him at the factory.

707
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,740
Unfortunately, I only got his number

708
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,660
without meeting him.

709
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,020
You have Xia Xinliang's number?

710
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:37,740
I do.

711
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,460
Why the laugh?

712
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,460
Nothing.

713
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,180
I'm just surprised.

714
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,580
How did you manage

715
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,540
to get Xia Xinliang's number?

716
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:54,940
Did you lie?

717
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,220
You could say that.

718
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:05,940
Hello?

719
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,540
Yes, speaking.

720
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,860
A complaint against me?

721
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,860
Okay, I'll be right there.

722
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,420
What's the matter?

723
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,460
The building management
said a neighbor made a complaint.

724
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,340
Supposedly someone at my house
is causing a disturbance.

725
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,340
You wench!

726
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,100
You lied about having an affair!

727
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,020
You even

728
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,060
brought the man home!

729
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,100
You have no shame!

730
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,700
Calm down!

731
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,060
You shameless piece of...

732
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:08,660
Don't abuse your seniority.

733
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,460
You better watch your words.

734
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,700
You watch your speech.

735
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,340
We're here to talk civilly.

736
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,980
If you're here to talk civilly,

737
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,540
then let's talk inside.

738
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,060
Okay.

739
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,220
We'll talk inside.

740
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,620
Take the things inside.

741
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:40,820
The things...

742
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,340
This is all I have left.

743
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,660
That's a lot of bank cards.

744
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,580
These are fuel cards.

745
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,020
Fuel cards?

746
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,180
Youning had given them to me

747
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,020
before he died.

748
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,900
They can't be exchanged for cash.

749
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,380
Over the years,

750
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,540
we've been paying off the house loan.

751
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,140
We only cleared it last year.

752
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,140
Youning had a lot of friends.

753
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,780
His expenditures were high.

754
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,580
As you can see,

755
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,780
we don't have much savings.

756
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,180
Even so,

757
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,900
it can't be only this little amount.

758
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,420
Xu Youning

759
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,820
did leave me with some cash.

760
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,260
After settling the funeral,

761
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,260
there are less than 50,000 left.

762
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,860
Just a few days ago,

763
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,820
Mr. Gao's coat got ruined

764
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,540
because of me.

765
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,780
I got him a new one as a replacement.

766
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,460
That ate into it.

767
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,020
Aside from that,

768
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,100
I spent it on the lawsuit.

769
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,500
This is all that's left.

770
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,900
