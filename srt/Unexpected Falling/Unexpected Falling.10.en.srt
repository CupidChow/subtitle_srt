00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,830
How did

4
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,800
he escape?

5
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,720
He didn't take the elevator

6
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,040
or the fire escape.

7
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,480
I remember clearly

8
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,630
that the sound-activated lights in the fire escape

9
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,270
were not on.

10
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,680
No one was in the fire escape at all.

11
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,360
Then,

12
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,830
we can only reenact

13
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,000
what happened last night.

14
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,520
How do we do that?

15
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,160
Let's go.

16
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,390
Take the elevator down

17
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,470
while I use the fire escape.

18
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,470
After you go down,

19
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,000
run to the place

20
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,830
where you met the guards

21
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:36,270
and return here.

22
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,470
See if I can manage

23
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,360
to escape.

24
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,630
Okay.

25
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,440
You took the elevator

26
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,270
on this level, right?

27
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,270
Yes.

28
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,720
I took this elevator

29
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,270
to come here.

30
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,630
Get the elevator.

31
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,160
It's here.

32
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,470
Begin!

33
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,520
You came back so quickly?

34
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,030
It's impossible to be faster than me.

35
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,630
You said he didn't take the elevator?

36
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,160
He didn't.

37
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,880
The other elevator

38
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,670
was on the fourth floor.

39
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,230
Where did the thief go?

40
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,480
I'm sure he didn't fly away.

41
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,070
Do you have any other ideas?

42
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,950
If I'm not mistaken,

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,230
he did escape using the elevator.

44
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,950
Are you saying

45
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,640
that he took the elevator to the fourth floor

46
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,720
and escaped using the stairs?

47
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,320
There's no need

48
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,000
to keep guessing here.

49
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:42,830
Let's go

50
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,440
and check the security camera footage.

51
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,950
You pressed the alarm

52
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,000
at 9:44 PM.

53
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,270
We'll start checking

54
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,270
from 9:40 PM.

55
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,880
Is that okay?

56
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,830
This is the security camera footage

57
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,550
for both elevators at Block 11.

58
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,670
You can have a look.

59
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,160
This was

60
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,110
when I had just arrived home.

61
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,000
This was when I ran out.

62
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,880
I was afraid

63
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,200
that someone might be going after me.

64
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,720
Take a look at another elevator.

65
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:06,270
Level 16.

66
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,390
It's on level 16.

67
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,600
This is B1.

68
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,830
It's the basement.

69
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,720
No wonder the elevator had been

70
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,390
on the fourth floor

71
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,230
when I ran back.

72
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,640
Someone really

73
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,670
broke into your house last night?

74
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,550
But nothing was missing.

75
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,670
Yes.

76
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,830
Do you need to make a police report?

77
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,000
Although nothing was stolen,

78
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,790
you should still make a police report.

79
00:07:59,350 --> 00:07:59,880
Come in.

80
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,000
Come in!

No. No one used an umbrella.

99
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,110
We can't find him like this.

100

It wasn't too late when he left.

101

any of the suspect's traits.

105
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,350
I don't think we can find anything

106
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,230
by checking the entrance's footage.

107
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:54,640
Yes.

108
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,760
If he came into the area

109
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
and changed his clothes,

110
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,320
no one would recognize him.

111
00:10:59,470 --> 00:10:59,880
Exactly.

112
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,880
Look, he is wearing

113
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,400
a pair of black leather shoes.

114
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,110
A culprit might

115
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,350
bring some clothes

116
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,320
with them to get changed,

117
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,030
but they wouldn't bring any shoes.

118
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,640
We might find something

119
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,550
if we follow this lead.

120
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,350
The area's camera

121
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,080
isn't that clear.

122
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,320
And it was dark.

123
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,080
You won't

124
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,960
be able to see their shoes.

125

Besides,

126
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,320
men's leather shoes

127
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,590
all look the same.

128
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,790
It's different from women's shoes.

129
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,590
How could you recognize them?

130
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,400
It's better

131
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,640
to go back and think

132
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,790
who the person is

133
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,470
and what he is after.

134
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:39,790

135
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,400

How did the guy break in?

138
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,350
A thief really broke into her house.

139
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,760
But nothing was stolen.

140
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,880
Why did you stop me

141
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,230
from checking the entrance's camera footage?

142
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,350
Let's go.

143
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,640
The guards wanted to avoid trouble.

144
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,000
But what about you?

145
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,550
Why did you stop me?

146
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,400
Do you want to know the reason so badly?

147
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,790
Have you always been this blunt?

148
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,640
Fine, I'll tell you.

149
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,840
First, I do think

150
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,640
it's pointless to check

151
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,400
the entrance's camera footage.

152
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,960
Since that person could hide himself

153
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,000
from the camera in the elevator,

154
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,910
he wouldn't

155
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,080
let the camera at the entrance catch him.

156
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,590
Second.

157
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,400
I don't want you to know

158
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,590
that I came back last night.

159
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,350
When?

160
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,640
When did you come back?

161
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,030
You hung up suddenly

162
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,230
and didn't pick up when I called you.

163
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,030
I rushed here because I was worried.

164
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,110
Coincidentally,

165
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,350
I met the two security guards

166
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,590
and found out that a thief broke into your house.

167
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,710
After that,

168
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,150
I was guarding your house outside
for most of the night.

169
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,880
Are you satisfied with this answer now?

170
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,080
There's no need to overthink.

171
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,030
I only did it as a friend.

172
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,000
I was also considering my relationship

173
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,110
with Yan and Su Wen.

174
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,760
If you don't mind,

175
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,790
I'm feeling a bit hungry.

176
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,000
I want to go back

177
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,400
and finish the porridge before I leave.

178
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:38,880
Can I do that?

179
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,280
This person

180
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,470
obviously knows your area well.

181
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,640
He knows how to hide from the cameras

182
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,880
and also knows

183
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,350
there are other exits

184
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,110
besides the unit door

185
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:04,640
at the basement.

186
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,400
Were you trying to find out

187
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,590
how tall that person is?

188
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,280
How was it?

189
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,230
From the length of the arm

190
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,470
and height of the elbow,

191
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,590
I think he is

192
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,670
ten centimeters shorter than me.

193
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,590
Ten centimeters?

194
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,590
Around 1.8 meters?

195
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,880
Do you suspect anyone?

196
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,520
No.

197
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,110
Can you help me

198
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,200
clean the blood

199
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,280
on this coat?

200
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,320
I have to

201
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,400
meet a client tomorrow afternoon.

202
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,000
There's a big hole.

203
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,080
You won't be able to wear it

204
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,080
even if it's cleaned.

205
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,470
Just clean it for now.

206
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,590
I only brought

207
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,350
this coat here.

208
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:06,960
I have no other coats.

209
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,110
Did Xu Youning have any coats?

210
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,590
Lend me one.

211
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,310
He did.

212
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,700
I don't think the size fits you.

213
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,140
I can only wear this then.

214
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,310
It's fine.

215
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,110
I can hang it on my arm if all else fails.

216
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,820
The porridge is cold, right?

217
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,670
Can you heat it up?

218
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,500
Sure. Let me do it.

219
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,060
Mr. Fang

220
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,380
kept emphasizing this during the meeting.

221
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,380
The inspection team must have

222
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,700
three "absolutes" from us.

223
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,990
Absolute understanding.

224
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:55,670
Absolute cooperation.

225
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,310
Absolute support.

226
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:57,940
So,

227
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,500
if any one of you has anything you need,

228
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,500
just let us know.

229
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,580
Don't hesitate.

230
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,500
Thank you.

231
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:15,190
We ended the day late again.

232
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,190
All of you

233
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,310
have worked hard.

234
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,460
Let's not

235
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,260
return to the hotel first.

236
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,550
I'll take all of you

237
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,340
to a place to relax.

238
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:24,430
How's that?

239
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,310
There's no need, Mr. Shen.

240
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,260
Thank you.

241
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,030
Why do you get off work so late?

242
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,340
Can your body take it?

243
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,380
Normal people like us

244
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,950
have to work hard.

245
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,620
Otherwise, how can we feed ourselves?

246
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,340
It's better to take care of your health.

247
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,260
I'm leaving.

248
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,670
Let's go.

249
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,710
It's fine. I'll wait for the next elevator.

250
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,710
Don't worry.

251
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:11,790
I will pay you.

252
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,430
What about 1% interest?

253
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,740
You know

254
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,790
the kind of person I am.

255
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:18,790
I'm not someone

256
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,190
who borrows money without repaying.

257
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,310
Is that so?

258
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,190
Forget it then.

259
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,310
I'll think of something else.

260
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,140
Su Wen.

261
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,190
Are you here

262
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:47,860
to pick up Yu?

263
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,950
I'm off. Bye.

264
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,340
Dear.

265
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,260
Give me the bag.

266
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,340
Su Wen just left.

267
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,140
I greeted her.

268
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:08,550
Let's go.

269
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,430
People like her

270
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,220
are arrogant.

271
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,980
They only care about people above her.

272
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,740
Just ignore her. It's pointless to talk to her.

273
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,710
She's the same as Ruan Zhenzhen.

274
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,710
Otherwise, why would they be friends?

275
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,260
Sure.

276
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,790

I've asked the court.

335
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,340
They asked me to wait for notice.

336

I'll be drawing lots with the plaintiff

00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,430
What's wrong?

516
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,940
What's wrong?

517
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,260
Don't you know who I am?

518
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,070
I'm the ex-girlfriend

519
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:37,780
that people hate.

520
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,760
Yan's wife might look like she does not care,

521
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,500
but she is treating me like a thief.

522
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:43,460
That's enough.

523
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,190
I'm won't be chatting with you

524
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:44,870
over the phone.

525
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:46,020
Let's talk when we meet.

526
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:46,540
I'm hanging up.

527
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:47,980
Sure. See you.

528
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:50,430
Su Wen, wait.

529
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,870
Over there...

530
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,540
Just say it.

531
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,940
I'm hanging up. Talk to you later.

532
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:21,780
Ms. Su Wen.

533
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:25,670
I saw you a few days ago.

534
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:26,980
I didn't greet you

535
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,220
because I was afraid of disturbing you.

536
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,700
How is Mrs. Xu?

537
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,780
I'm so busy

538
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,700
that I have no time to visit her.

539
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,020
Did you meet her

540
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:35,980
when you came here?

541
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,020
I did. She is doing well.

542
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,870
Oh, right. How is her lawsuit

543
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:42,590
going?

544
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,740
I have a friend who is a lawyer.

545
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,870
Do you need any help?

546
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:46,910
There's no need.

547
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,020
We have a lawyer.

548
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,460
You found one?

549
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,780
Is it Xu's classmate?

550
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,150
Xu mentioned that person before.

551
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:59,150
I think his surname is Gao.

552
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:03,910
Yes. Gao Jun.

553
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,390
That's right. That's it.

554
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:10,630
Xu said

555
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:11,740
this classmate of his

556
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,910
is a capable attorney.

557
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:14,830
That's great.

558
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,430
I'm sure Mrs. Xu will be fine

559
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,350
with his help.

560
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,260
Sorry to keep you from your work.

561
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,150
I won't disturb you anymore.

562
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:24,500
See you later.

563
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:25,350
See you later.

564
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:39,980
Miss.

565
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,430
This is from last year's autumn collection.

566
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,430
It's the last one.

567
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,150
Since it's last year's collection,

568
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,780
can I have any discount?

569
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:48,500
Sorry.

570
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,630
We don't have discounts

571
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:50,500
on all our items.

572
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,390
Should I put it in a bag for you?

573
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:54,740
Sure.

574
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:06,830
You're paying by cash?

575
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,630
So much.

576
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:18,300
Yu, be cautious

577
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,460
with the money.

578
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:20,670
Don't let You Gang

579
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,020
give all the money to his parents.

580
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:22,740
Do you hear me?

581
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,260
Gang didn't.

582
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,110
That's good.

583
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,540
I'm just reminding you.

584
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,150
Be careful.

585
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:31,700
Be careful.

586
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:42,870
What is it now?

587
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,350
