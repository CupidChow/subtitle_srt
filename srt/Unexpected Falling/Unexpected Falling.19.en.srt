00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,910
Not bad, Ruan Zhenzhen.

343
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,070
You've got some tricks up your sleeve.

344
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,710
How come you were so sure

345
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,670
that Xia Xinliang would turn up?

346
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,220
I wasn't sure.

347
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,790
I just tried my luck.

348
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,500
Ruan Zhenzhen.

349
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,740
You're much more daring than you look.

350
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,500
You dared to tail Xia Xinliang on your own.

351
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,460
Have you thought about

352
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,430
what happens next

353
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,340
after you find him?

354
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,140
Turn right.

355
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,460
Hello?

356
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,710
Where are you?

357
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,430
Your car is here.

358
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,910
But you're not home.

359
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,190
I'm out to deal with something.

360
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,220
Why?

361
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:45,950
Are you at my place?

362
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,710
[Nanzhou Xinliang Food Processing Manufacturer]
We've been working overtime lately.

363
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,790
So I asked for a half day off

364
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,500
from my supervisor to rest.

365
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,550
I thought I should visit you.

366
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,100
Where are you?

367
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:55,950
Is anything the matter?

368
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,380
I'm discussing the lawsuit with Gao Jun.

369
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,670
Discussing the lawsuit?

370
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,260
Where?

371
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:08,790
I'll go there.

372
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,380
You don't have to come.

373
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,310
Don't have to come?

374
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:13,860
What does that mean?

375
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,430
Are you really

376
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,460
with Gao Jun?

377
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:19,980
You're here.

378
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,740
Alright, we're discussing important business.

379
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,430
Talk to you later.

380
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:23,950
Hello?

381
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,140
What should we do?

382
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:43,980
Take care.

383
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,500
Go in. Lock the door.

384
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,670
Yes, will do.

385
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,670
Alright.

386
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,550
What...

387
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,620
What are you doing?

388
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,710
Who are you people?

389
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,740
Don't be nervous, Mr. Xia.

390
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,500
We're in broad daylight.

391
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,310
What do you think you're doing?

392
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,220
(Get out of my car.)

393
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,620
(Or else, I'm calling the police.)

394
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,030
Do you know Xu Youning?

395
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:34,710
(Mr. Xia.)

396
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,790
(Let's find a place to talk.)

397
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,500
It's payment for goods? What goods?

398
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,030
What did

399
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:46,860
Xu Youning buy from you?

400
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,790
That's none of your business.

401
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,460
I don't have to tell you anything either.

402
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,790
The money Xu Youning borrowed,

403
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,380
13 million of it

404
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,620
was remitted to your account.

405
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,500
None of my business, you say?

406
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,380
I told you.

407
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,260
It's payment for goods.

408
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,190
Okay?

409
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,030
As for whether

410
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,260
the money was borrowed

411
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,190
or Xu Youning's own,

412
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:14,910
that's not my problem.

413
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,620
He bought something from me,

414
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:18,500
so he had to pay me.

415
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,620
Am I right?

416
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,460
Isn't that how business works?

417
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,140
I didn't do anything out of line.

418
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,430
Right?

419
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,030
If it's payment for goods,

420
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,310
where is the purchase agreement?
Or the receipt?

421
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,910
What do you have

422
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:31,980
that can prove it's payment for goods?

423
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,500
Why should I

424
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,220
have to show you proof?

425
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,950
Who are you?

426
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,950
You don't have to prove anything to us.

427
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,220
But prepare

428
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,140
to prove it to the court.

429
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,500
What do you mean?

430
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,740
We can sue you.

431
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,220
(Once the case is filed,)

432
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:12,460
(you'll have to provide)

433
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,140
(all the information.)

434
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,910
(Sue me for what?)

435
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,500
You think you run the court?

436
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,220
Can you simply file a case?

437
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,090
We have a loan agreement

438
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,430
and transaction records.

439
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,500
That makes it

440
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,620
easy to file a case, no?

441
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,500
What loan agreement?

442
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,260
There's no loan agreement.

443
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,740
It's not hard to make one.

444
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,070
You...

445
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,100
You're going to create a fake one?

446
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,550
Then you're breaking the law.

447
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:58,980
Besides,

448
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,430
the court will refute it.

449
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,140
Whether they refute it or not,

450
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,710
that happens after the case is filed.

451
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,710
I'm not scared of a lawsuit.

452
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,500
You won't be able to fool the court.

453
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,740
You're right.

454
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,030
I can't fool them.

455
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,550
Because I never planned to.

456
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,860
That said, neither can you fool them.

457
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,340
This factory of yours

458
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,430
is just a shell company.

459
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,030
The money

460
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,220
isn't actually in your account.

461
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,710
Your account

462
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,140
is only a means

463
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,100
to transfer the funds.

464
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,190
Once received,

465
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,220
you just transfer it to another account.

466
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,030
Am I right?

467
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,140
This isn't the first time you did it.

468
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,670
(Neither will it be your last.)

469
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:41,740
(Are you sure)

470
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,340
(you'll risk getting exposed)

471
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,070
(to the court?)

472
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,790
What is it you want exactly?

473
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,790
You said it yourself.

474
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:56,670
The money

475
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:57,950
only passed through

476
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:58,710
my account.

477
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,460
It's just passing money.

478
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,790
It's long gone.

479
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,950
I don't have any money for you guys.

480
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,140
What I want to know

481
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,140
is where you sent the money.

482
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:10,500
I...

483
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,950
I have no idea where it went.

484
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,100
To be frank,

485
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,670
the account

486
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,310
is not mine.

487
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,100
Well, they just used my name

488
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,790
to open the account.

489
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,590
Whose money they took

490
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:28,590
and where they sent it,

491
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,310
I have no idea at all.

492
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,670
It's no use asking me.

493
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,710
How are you connected to Xu Youning?

494
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:34,910
Why did he use

495
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:36,260
your account for the turnover of funds?

496
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,430
You should know this, Mr. Xia.

497
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,310
A bank account can only be used by its owner.

498
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,460
If it's lent to someone else,

499
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:51,860
all consequences

500
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,590
will be borne by the owner.

501
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,380
Let me make it clearer for you.

502
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,470
If the other party did anything illegal,

503
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,590
you'd have to bear the legal repercussions.

504
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:23,430
I...

505
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,430
Actually, I don't have any connection

506
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,620
to Xu Youning.

507
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,790
We've never even met.

508
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,460
(That account)

509
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,790
(wasn't for him to use.)

510
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,100
(It's for somebody else.)

511
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,430
Who?

512
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:43,870
I don't know either.

513
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:44,750
I don't know the person.

514
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,470
You've surely met him.

515
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,630
What does he look like?

516
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:51,540
How old?

517
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:58,710
He's not tall.

518
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,260
Wears glasses, 40 plus years old.

519
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,180
What's his surname?

520
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:05,900
(I think...)

521
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:06,870
(the surname is Qiu.)

522
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:12,870
Hello?

523
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,350
I've got it, Mr. Qiu.

524
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:16,980
A man or woman?

525
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:18,670
The person's hair is wavy.

526
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,780
I'm guessing it's a woman.

527
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,260
What's the number plate?

528
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:28,150
The number plate is

529
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,190
Hai C85767.

530
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,020
Qiu Zhijian.

531
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,150
Qiu Zhijian?

532
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,590
Based on Xia Xinliang's description,

533
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:07,910
that person

534
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,670
should be the director of operations

535
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,460
of Jinshang Capital,

536
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,300
Qiu Zhijian.

537
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,780
It all adds up.

538
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:08,830
What adds up?

539
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,980
When I went to pack Youning's stuff

540
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,740
in his office,

541
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:15,670
the way Qiu Zhijian acted was already weird.

542
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:19,670
Mrs. Xu, are you all right?

543
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,190
I came to see

544
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,740
if you need any help.

545
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,500
He seemed very afraid that I might

546
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,190
find something.

547
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:34,940
He must have told

548
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,220
Lu Yang to keep an eye on me.

549
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,190
They're in this together.

550
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,430
Why did Xu Youning

551
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,940
use Xia Xinliang's account to launder money?

552
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,500
And these accounts

553
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,910
are all under Qiu Zhijian's control.

554
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:53,700
Qiu Zhijian first ordered Lu Yang

555
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,460
to keep an eye on you.

556
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,700
Then,

557
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,070
he made him

558
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,150
go to your house to look for something.

559
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,220
Don't you find it odd?

560
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:02,780
What's odd about it?

561
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,780
Think about it.

562
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:07,980
Firstly,

563
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,430
the account Xu Youning used

564
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,940
was in Qiu Zhijian's hands.

565
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,910
Shouldn't he have kept

566
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:14,980
such an important thing

567
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,110
to himself?

568
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:17,870
Also,

569
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,940
if these accounts

570
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,630
were in Qiu Zhijian's hands,

571
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,300
why did he get someone

572
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,740
to rummage

573
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,500
through your house?

574
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:26,830
What is he looking for?

575
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,540
Something he doesn't want others to know.

576
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,500
Right.

577
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,110
That is a possibility.

578
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,780
But there's another possibility.

579
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,830
If Xu Youning was confident enough

580
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:43,830
to use the account

581
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,260
that was in Qiu Zhijian's hands,

582
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,500
it proves that he must have had something

583
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,870
that could be used against Qiu.

584
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,540
Since Qiu Zhijian

585
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,780
has control over the accounts,

586
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:58,390
the thing Lu Yang was after in my house

587
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,020
can't have anything to do with the accounts.

588
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,350
Then what could it be?

589
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,780
Never mind that.

590
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,260
Do you think

591
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,430
what Xia Xinliang said

592
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,210
can be trusted?

593
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:19,780
Anyway,

594
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,630
why did you suddenly want

595
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,870
to look for Xia Xinliang?

596
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,630
One thing you said made a lot of sense.

597
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,460
Either I find the money,

598
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:31,590
or find the thing.

599
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,540
I have to find

600
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,390
one of the two

601
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,260
if I wish to be spared.

602
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,150
I'm going off first.

603
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:50,870
What are you doing?

604
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,020
Let go.

605
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,500
Let me go!

606
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,190
I'm sorry.

607
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,260
I'd like to apologize to you.

608
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,630
For what happened

609
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,740
the other day and in the past.

610
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,150
Will you only let me go

611
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:30,460
if I say

612
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,390
it's okay?

613
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,110
Okay, I accept your apology.

614
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:42,870
It's fine.

615
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,150
Okay?

616
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,780
You won't bring it up again?

617
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,390
I won't bring up the past. Okay?

618
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,070
Let me give you a lift.

619
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,460
No need. I can take a taxi.

620
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,590
Don't.

621
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:07,500
Money doesn't come easy.

622
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,190
Then I'll walk.

623
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,110
Walking doesn't require money.

624
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,910
Unlock the car. My bag's inside.

625
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,220
Sure, you can walk.

626
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:20,740
I'll walk with you then.

627
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,190
I could use a walk right now.

628
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:32,780
Unlock the door.

629
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,110
