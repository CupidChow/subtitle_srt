00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,310
I've left the keys to the new lock

349
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,590
and the damaged lock

350
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:01,860
on your shoe cabinet.

351
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,140
Hello.

352
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,190
Can you talk now?

353
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,070
Do as you're told.

354
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,070
I don't want to go.

355
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,380
What's it?

356
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,910
I have something to ask you.

357
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:42,590
Go ahead.

358
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,950
Last time,

359
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:44,830
you called a locksmith to fix my door.

360
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,140
How many spare keys

361
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,500
did the locksmith give you?

362
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,620
No.

363
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:55,460
Come here.

364
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,620
Spare keys?

365
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,260
Yes, how many spare keys did he give you?

366
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,790
I didn't pay attention to that. What's wrong?

367
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,030
Why did you ask this suddenly?

368
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,340
I left my key

369
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,140
at home today.

370
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,070
So I called a locksmith

371
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,340
to unlock the door.

372
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,670
He told me that the lock

373
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,710
has six spare keys.

374
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,190
I searched all over

375
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,950
and only found five keys.

376
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,620
Do you have

377
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,310
the contact number of that locksmith?

378
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,620
I'd like to ask him about the spare keys.

379
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,430
I'm occupied now.

380
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,500
We'll talk about this

381
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,500
when I go back, okay?

382
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,310
Okay.

383
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,710
I've informed the tuition teacher.

384
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,100
You have to bring her
into the classroom by yourself.

385
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,910
Do you live in the same neighborhood

386
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:47,950
as Shi Shengyu and You Gang?

387
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,340
Yes.

388
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,380
I'm handling a case recently.

389
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,910
If someone comes to you...

390
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,100
I'll tell them that it has nothing to do with me

391
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,550
and I don't know you.

392
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,430
All I ask from you

393
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,860
is to take care of this naughty girl.

394
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,030
I won't ask for more.

395
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,620
I just want her

396
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,190
to stay with me till next month
and hand her over to An Ruiyuan

397
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,340
without any hassle happens.

398
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,570
[Mr. Qian]

399
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,190
Hello.

400
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:40,830
Ruan Zhenzhen.

401
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,310
Just tell me

402
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,430
if you're quitting.

403
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,830
No, I'm not quitting the job.

404
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,950
Regarding your mother and me,

405
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,500
it's not like what your aunt said.

406
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,070
Back then,

407
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,070
something went wrong

408
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:11,910
between your parents

409
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:12,710
and your mother wanted to get a divorce.

410
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:13,980
So she hired me

411
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,980
as her attorney.

412
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,590
It was only

413
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,710
a common divorce case.

414
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:19,860
However,

415
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,100
a conflict sparked between them

416
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,340
to get custody of you

417
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,380
and something unpleasant happened.

418
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,030
Your father thought

419
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,030
it was me

420
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,140
who instigated your mother,

421
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,180
so he wanted to harm me with a knife.

422
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,710
Your mother then tried to stop him

423
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,100
and accidentally stabbed him

424
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,550
during the fight.

425
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:42,790
Liar!

426
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,830
You're lying!

427
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:51,860
Your mother is coming home

428
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,790
next month.

429
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,310
Whether it's a lie or not,

430
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,790
ask her.

431
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,310
What's going on

432
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,260
between you and Ruan Zhenzhen?

433
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,670
She's my client.

434
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,670
Really?

435
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:08,620
Yes.

436
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,220
Are you here to experience life again,

437
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,380
Princess Ruan?

438
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,030
Did you go shopping abroad

439
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,550
during the past few days?

440
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,460
Hello?

441
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,500
Are you working in the restaurant again?

442
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:26,980
This is a special case.

443
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,460
I'll talk to you later.

444
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,100
By the way, are you off work?

445
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,430
Not yet.

446
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,980
Take care and don't strain yourself.

447
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,260
Wait for me there after getting off work.

448
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,260
I'll go fetch you.

449
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:42,980
Okay.

450
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:55,830
Why are you looking at me?

451
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,550
Can't I?

452
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,460
Stop doing illegal things.

453
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,460
Otherwise, I have to clean up your mess again.

454
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,550
Let's go.

455
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,310
Come on.

456
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,830
Where to?

457
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,980
To return the key.

458
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:26,980
Ruan.

459
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,950
Are you seeing someone?

460
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,190
Who's he?

461
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,380
Oh my, is he a fine man?

462
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,670
Why are you hiding it?

463
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,420
Are you scared that I'll steal your man?

464
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,380
Tell me now. Is he hot?

465
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,020
Come on, sir.

466
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,070
Sir.

467
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,540
Don't worry.

468
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,780
I'm not trying to bluff.

469
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,900
But our company

470
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,300
is the top one in this industry.

471
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,380
Top company.

472
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,630
Top one.

473
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:06,900
I guarantee

474
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,540
you will get more than your project payment.

475
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,380
Cheers!

476
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,830
Yes, we'll definitely make your money worth it.

477
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,500
Cheers.

478
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:16,870
Sir.

479
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,540
I have complete trust in you

480
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,950
to handle this business.

481
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,020
Come on, let's raise our glasses.

482
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,470
Cheers.

483
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,300
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

484
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:24,870
Drink up.

485
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,070
Cheers, Mr. Li.

486
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,780
I'll handle this.

487
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,070
I'll do this.

488
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,260
What's wrong?

489
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,260
Are you alright?

490
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,020
I'll help you to sit down.

491
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:55,710
You need rest.

492
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:56,900
Come on.

493
00:33:59,300 --> 00:33:59,950
Careful.

494
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,140
What's wrong?

495
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,420
Is it because you suddenly stood up?

496
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,710
Let me send you to the hospital now.

497
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,220
I'm fine.

498
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,590
I'm feeling a bit dizzy.

499
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,940
Perhaps it's because I skipped dinner.

500
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,430
Can you please

501
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:19,540
get me some food?

502
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:21,780
Give me a second.

503
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,300
I only got this. Have some.

504
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,670
I will go get some water.

505
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,940
Wait for me here.

506
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,350
Here. Drink some water.

507
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,020
Drink slowly.

508
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:02,590
I'm fine.

509
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,110
I'm fine now.

510
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,500
Are you sure?

511
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:09,300
Do you want me to take you to the hospital?

512
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,070
No, thanks.

513
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,350
Stop.

514
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,540
I'll do it.

515
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,190
Don't do it.

516
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,260
Are you sure you're alright?

517
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,350
Yes.

518
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,430
