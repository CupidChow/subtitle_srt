00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,590
Tangtang, what...

341
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,990
Didn't you say you are at home?

342
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,110
You lied to me.

343
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,630
Who lied to whom?

344
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,500
You jerk.

345
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,300
How dare you cheat on me?

346
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,750
What are you talking about?

347
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,350
Speak.

348
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,780
Where is that woman?

349
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,710
What woman?

350
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:55,630
You won't be honest with me?

351
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,230
Find her!

352
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,470
-Let's go.
-Find her.

353
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,660
Hey, stop it. This is the hospital.

354
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,470
Tangtang, this is the hospital.
Don't make a scene.

355
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,380
Please keep your voices down.

356
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,660
This is the hospital.

357
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,710
The patients need to rest.

358
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,630
Can you guys not...

359
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,750
No, wait. Listen to me.

360
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,630
We're at the hospital.

361
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:10,500
Can we go home and talk?

362
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,110
No.

363
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:11,540
Please.

364
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,500
Let's go home first.

365
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,110
I'm not going.

366
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,230
Don't blame me for this then.

367
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,070
Put me down!

368
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:18,630
Put me down!

369
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:19,180
Tangtang!

370
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:20,420
Tangtang!

371
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,380
Tangtang!

372
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,180
Yan, what are you doing?

373
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:22,990
Tangtang!

374
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:24,990
Tangtang!

375
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:25,780
Put Tangtang down!

376
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,300
That's enough. Please leave.

377
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,540
What happened outside?

378
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:44,590
It's nothing.

379
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,350
Some family was making a scene.

380
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,540
The security took care of it.

381
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,590
Did you see Yan?

382
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,710
He was here.

383
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:53,350
He went to look for you.

384
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,990
I saw him. We spoke a bit.

385
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,540
A call came in.

386
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,420
I think it was urgent.

387
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,380
So I told him to leave first.

388
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:02,900
If you're busy,

389
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,710
you can go too.

390
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:05,900
I can manage on my own.

391
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,540
I'm fine.

392
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,260
I bumped into someone I know just now.

393
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:10,380
His parent

394
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,260
is also hospitalized.

395
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,710
So I went to greet them.

396
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,260
What is it?

397
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,660
Nothing.

398
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,140
I said, put me down.

399
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,020
-Get in the car.
-Hey.

400
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:41,710
Get in.

401
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,230
Yan, you jerk!

402
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,350
I'm going to make you pay for today.

403
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,350
If it's not your mistress,

404
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,470
why can't I meet with her?

405
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:56,990
Answer me.

406
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,380
Enough. I have to drive.

407
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,950
Make sure to rest more at home.

408
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:11,750
Thank you.

409
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:12,630
You're welcome.

410
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:28,990
Let's go.

411
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,020
Su Wen.

412
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,750
She's really worried about you.

413
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,870
You told Su Wen?

414
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,540
Su Wen.

415
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,770
Hello, Gao Jun.

416
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,830
I'm about to reach

417
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,660
Nanzhou.

418
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:58,710
How is Zhenzhen?

419
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,470
Don't worry.

420
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,470
We're back home.

421
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,990
Back home? Is she okay now?

422
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,110
The doctor said it's nothing serious.

423
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,060
She just needs to rest more.

424
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,140
That's good.

425
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,710
I'll go straight to her place then.

426
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:16,990
She's coming over.

427
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:22,350
Hello, Su Wen.

428
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:23,780
Aren't you out of town

429
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,500
to deliver materials?

430
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:25,630
No need to rush here.

431
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,750
I'm fine now.

432
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,950
Save your breath, miss.

433
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,070
With your current condition,

434
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:29,830
how can I let you

435
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,020
be alone at home?

436
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,540
Ask Gao Jun to stay for a bit.

437
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,420
We'll talk when I'm there.

438
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,950
Are you done with your work in the province?

439
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,420
It's fine.

440
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,660
I can rush back tomorrow afternoon.

441
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,110
I've already made arrangements.

442
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:40,950
You need not worry.

443
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,140
You really don't have to come.

444
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,780
If I don't go, what will happen to you?

445
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,110
You don't have to stand on ceremony with me.

446
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,300
Drop the act.

447
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,470
Gao Jun will stay and keep me company.

448
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,590
Gao Jun will stay?

449
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:57,870
Yeah.

450
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,420
He's free these days.

451
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,660
So he can keep me company.

452
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,020
With him here,

453
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,540
you shouldn't have to worry.

454
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,790
Hello?

455
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,590
What is going on?

456
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,750
I happen to be free tomorrow morning.

457
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:31,950
Sorry about that.

458
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,950
I didn't give you a heads-up

459
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,500
before using you as an excuse.

460
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:40,830
Su Wen is physically weak.

461
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:41,900
She can't bear the stress.

462
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,470
Besides, there's really no need.

463
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,070
I'm okay now.

464
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,900
I can manage on my own at home.

465
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,230
It's okay for me to stay.

466
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,260
I can sleep in the living room.

467
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,300
The study room's fine too.

468
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:00,990
It's really okay.

469
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,710
I've troubled you enough.

470
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,630
It's getting late.

471
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:07,870
I won't keep you.

472
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:11,950
Zhenzhen.

473
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,630
It's not like

474
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,660
we've never been under the same roof before.

475
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,110
This is different.

476
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,500
Different, how?

477
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,710
I actually think

478
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,470
this place is bigger

479
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:22,380
than your old house.

480
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,540
Besides,

481
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,500
we don't have anything to hide.

482
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:26,780
Why the worry?

483
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,110
The Xus already caused

484
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,750
a scene today.

485
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:30,870
If you stay,

486
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,070
who knows what sort of trouble

487
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,260
would ensue

488
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:33,990
if they saw you again?

489
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,990
I'm no longer bothered by it.

490
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,710
But you.

491
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,230
Don't you care about your reputation?

492
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:46,990
Go back.

493
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,470
I'm really okay.

494
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:55,900
If there is anything,

495
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,590
I'll call you.

496
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,110
Alright?

497
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,300
Okay then.

498
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,590
I'll leave now.

499
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:03,900
Have a good rest.

500
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,350
Call me if there's anything.

501
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:08,990
No need to see me off.

502
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:09,780
The door is ajar.

503
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,660
Don't get locked out.

504
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:55,300
[Su Wen: Is there something between you
and Gao Jun you're not telling me?]

505
00:31:55,300 --> 00:32:01,810
[There's nothing. Just go home.
Text me when you reach.]

506
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,400
[Ruan Zhenzhen]

507
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:20,750
Okay.

508
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,420
Got it. Bye.

509
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:27,750
How are you?

510
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,070
Is your arm okay?

511
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:30,830
It's fine.

512
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,780
Ruan Zhenzhen found out

513
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,350
about the fake watch.

514
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,260
So soon?

515
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,260
She found out when she tried to sell it.

516
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,300
She sold the watch?

517
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,420
That means she's really pushed for money.

518
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,020
But currently,

519
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,110
she still believes that the watch

520
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:48,950
was from Xu Youning.

521
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,630
Boss.

522
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:51,710
Isn't this

523
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:52,590
exactly what you wanted?

524
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:43,830
What's on your mind?

525
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,540
I was thinking

526
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,180
when the guy

527
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,300
broke into Ruan Zhenzhen's house,

528
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,140
why did he use an umbrella to cover him?

529
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:52,350
I mean, normally,

530
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,300
you would just cover with a cap, right?

531
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,230
Why did he use an umbrella of all things?

532
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:09,940
(Lock the door from the inside.)

533
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,630
(Don't remove the key.)

534
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,590
(This way, the door cannot be unlocked)

535
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,350
(from the outside.)

536
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,150
(It's okay for me to stay.)

537
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,700
(I can sleep in the living room.)

538
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:41,300
(The study room's fine too.)

539
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:15,000
[Ruan Zhenzhen]

540
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,780
Hello, Ruan Zhenzhen.

541
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,110
Gao Jun.

542
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:22,300
There's someone in the house.

543
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,350
What? Someone's in your house?

544
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,670
Where are you now?

545
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,780
In my bedroom. He's in the study.

546
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:27,870
Stay where you are.

547
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:28,830
Lock the door.

548
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:29,390
Keep talking to me.

549
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,020
I'll be right there.

550
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,430
I'm already home.

551
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,460
Why haven't you reached home yet?

552
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:51,830
Don't worry.

553
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,150
I know.

554
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,220
Okay.

555
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:07,460
Okay.

556
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:26,910
Ruan Zhenzhen.

557
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,110
Are you there?

558
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:28,910
Say something.

559
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,110
He's unlocking the door.

560
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,220
I want to go outside

561
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,430
and try to see who it is.

562
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,700
No! Don't open the door.

563
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,020
I'm almost there.

564
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,430
That guy just left.

565
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:41,430
I almost caught him.

566
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,940
When I was downstairs,

567
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,700
I saw him heading to the basement.

568
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,780
He took the elevator this time,

569
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,780
not the fire escape.

570
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:49,780
No sign of forced entry.

571
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,590
He snuck in while you were out.

572
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,220
It should be the same guy.

573
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,350
The same one as before.

574
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,110
Let's talk inside.

575
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,390
Your wound is bleeding.

576
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:13,460
Let me

577
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,350
clean it up for you.

578
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:14,980
It's alright.

579
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,940
The suture is intact. It's just a little bleeding.

580
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:18,980
Have you wondered why?

581
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,870
The person broke into your house two times,

582
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,430
but he took nothing.

583
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,300
Clearly, he didn't come for money.

584
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,500
So what is he after?

585
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,630
What is it?

586
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:35,110
If my guess is correct,

587
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,260
he didn't come to steal.

588
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,070
He's looking for something.

589
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,210
There must be something

590
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:43,910
in the house

591
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:44,590
that he's interested in.

592
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,740
That's why they kept coming

593
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,110
to look for it

594
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:48,940
despite the risks.

595
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,390
Did Xu Youning

596
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,020
leave anything special to you?

597
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,940
Think carefully.

598
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,070
Does a debt of 40 million count?

599
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,830
I've checked your door lock.

600
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,670
It's of good quality.

601
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:44,940
Without the right key,

602
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:46,500
even a professional

603
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,430
would find it hard to unlock.

604
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:48,780
But in the last two break-ins,

605
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,110
it's clear that the guy

606
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:50,980
unlocked it without any problem.

607
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,590
And there was no trace

608
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,020
of any forced entry.

609
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:57,830
What are you trying to say?

610
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:01,730
We've neglected

611
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,740
an important point.

612
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,020
That person

613
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:07,980
most likely

614
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,110
has the key to your house.

615
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,430
