347
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,980
You are heartless.

348
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:03,900
I came all the way here

349
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,940
to give you the phone

350
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,140
and you cooked this for me.

351
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,820
I'm sick, okay?

352
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,540
I need nutrients.

353
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,580
I added an egg for you.

354
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,460
Am I supposed to say thank you?

355
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:17,940
Try it out.

356
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,260
If I get a new phone,

357
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,180
they will have more reasons

358
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,140
to believe I have

359
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,060
those 40 million yuan.

360
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,780
Who cares about them?

361
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,380
If you keep your old phone,

362
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,220
will they believe you're broke?

363
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:38,620
Oh.

364
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,500
Why are you reading

365
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,580
the lawsuit documents?

366
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,660
What's going on with Gao Jun?

367
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,580
I didn't have time to ask him yesterday.

368
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,500
Is he leaving?

369
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,060
Come clean now.

370
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:03,420
Did something

371
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,500
happen again?

372
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,060
Su Wen.

373
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,820
I'm in a dilemma now.

374
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,220
What dilemma?

375
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,060
You

376
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,220
are worrying needlessly.

377
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,660
I agree with Gao Jun.

378
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,020
Both of you are adults.

379
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,140
Everyone knows what they are doing.

380
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,540
No one is being lied to or used.

381
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,140
Why do you

382
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,260
have to stick

383
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,340
to your principles

384
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,020
and build a wall around you?

385
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,820
Gao Jun

386
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,700
wants to help you.

387
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:48,940
He is willing to.

388
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:49,860
When he helps you,

389
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,660
he feels proud, happy.

390
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,780
It's because he does something good.

391
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,740
Not because you give him something in return.

392
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,860
But I don't want...

393
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,700
You don't want what?

394
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,380
What did he

395
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,180
ask from you?

396
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,220
Nothing, right?

397
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,460
So what's stopping you?

398
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,020
I don't want to owe him.

399
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,420
My friend.

400
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,460
Living in this society

401
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,140
means owing each other.

402
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,020
Either you owe it to him or he owes it to you.

403
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,420
Don't you get it?

404
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,900
All right. Have your noodles now.

405
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,940
The noodles are turning mushy.

406
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,420
I cooked them for you with my heart.

407
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,140
Why is the box so heavy?

408
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,860
God knows?

409
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,020
Everything comes

410
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,380
in a fancy package now.

411
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,700
Almost as if the package

412
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,940
is worth more money than its content.

413
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,700
Just throw it away.

414
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,260
No.

415
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,420
What if it's useful in the future?

416
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,300
I'll keep it.

417
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,020
Okay.

418
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,020
I see.

419
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,020
Be thorough.

420
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,940
Don't give her a chance to make a comeback victory.

421
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:12,980
Listen.

422
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,380
Continue watching.

423
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,500
Unless she goes to jail,

424
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,540
don't let your guard down.

425
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,460
Who is the victim this time?

426
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,500
It's delicious.

427
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,540
It's not easy to get

428
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,300
a compliment from you.

429
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:57,780
Some rocks, please.

430
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,900
You have met the people from Anhe.

431
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,780
What's your next move?

432
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,140
Why? Are you worried?

433
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,700
Of course.

434
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,180
My money is in it.

435
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:12,580
Here.

436
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,540
Be patient.

437
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,820
Just pray now.

438
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,540
I hate you.

439
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,660
You're being cryptic again.

440
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:35,660
Hello?

441
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,380
Yes, I'm here.

442
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:39,820
Come over.

443
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,700
I'll wait for you.

444
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,100
Okay.

445
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,100
My friend is coming.

446
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,820
Yes, I know.

447
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,700
I won't disturb you two.

448
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,060
I'll leave now.

449
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,660
See you.

450
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,260
Okay.

451
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:05,900
Jianshe.

452
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,100
Truth be told,

453
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,940
I would love to see

454
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,700
who can make the busy Mr. Fang

455
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:16,210
wait here.

456
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,020
You're looking for

457
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,500
another ladder of success at my place.

458
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:24,940
Bye.

459
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,060
Take care.

460
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,300
Fang Jianshe is now waiting

461
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,580
for orders from the higher-ups.

462
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:42,940
However,

463
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,660
it should be soon enough.

464
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,700
You should get ready.

465
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,340
After Anhe's stocks go back into trading

466
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,300
and Jinshang boosts their price,

467
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,660
we run.

468
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,180
Also,

469
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,380
cover your track.

470
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,180
Hello?

471
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:44,740
What's up?

472
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,340
It's been a tiring day.

473
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,020
And I miss you.

474
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,060
If you're tired,

475
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,620
you should rest then.

476
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,060
Okay.

477
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:31,780
I'll hang up then.

478
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,260
Zhenzhen.

479
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,460
If one day,

480
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,100
I do something bad

481
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,860
and disappoint you,

482
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,100
will you hate me?

483
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,180
You told me

484
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,740
to let nature take its course.

485
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,340
I won't blame you.

486
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,020
Rest early now. Goodbye.

487
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:30,780
Come in.

488
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,780
So heavy.

489
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,180
Come on, lift.

490
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:39,740
Dude.

491
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,100
Not there.

492
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,060
Put him on the couch first.

493
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:49,700
I...

494
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,860
Go. Go.

495
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:54,980
Stand right there.

496
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,540
Who are you two?

497
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,500
Why did you let You Gang

498
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,340
drink that much?

499
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,100
Sorry, ma'am.

500
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,740
Sorry, miss.

501
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,420
Right.

502
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,420
We didn't ask him to drink.

503
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,780
He insisted on drinking.

504
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,500
We couldn't stop him.

505
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,020
We

506
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,300
have done our job of bringing him here.

507
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,300
We'll leave now.

508
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,020
Run!

509
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,260
Yu.

510
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,780
Bring him in.

511
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:36,980
Let him rot here.

512
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,140
Yu?

513
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,700
It's a deal then.

514
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,860
We'll queue up earlier tomorrow.

515
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,540
If we queue up earlier,

516
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,900
it'll be cheaper.

517
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:11,980
Mom.

518
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,020
Where is Yu?

519
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,300
Yu

520
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,300
went to work.

521
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:23,940
Isn't it the weekend today?

522
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:25,660
To work overtime.

523
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,740
She has to work overtime

524
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,100
to feed the kid.

525
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:30,980
She can't rely on anyone,

526
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,740
so she has to work.

527
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,420
Men

528
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:40,860
don't have to be rich.

529
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:41,940
They just have to be responsible.

530
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,700
Some men would go out drinking

531
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,980
even if they can't feed their wives and kids.

532
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:46,860
Shame on them.

533
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,420
Slamming the door now?

534
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,620
If I knew this would happen,

535
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,660
I wouldn't have

536
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,980
let my daughter marry you.

537
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,380
