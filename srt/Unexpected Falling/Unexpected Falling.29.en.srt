why are you still hanging out with those people?

It's pretty painful.

Bear with it a little.

I don't want to nag.

232

Why didn't you wear gloves

234
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,250
Look at these blisters.

If they burst,

236
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:41,820
they'll get infected easily.

237
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,420
I was too distracted.

238
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,820
At that time, I was already in a mess.

239
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,850
It was raining heavily,

240
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,300
and I was in a remote area.

241
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,780
There was no one for me to call for help.

242
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,970
I even wanted to leave without my car.

243
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:02,850
But I realized

244
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,370
that I couldn't.

245
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,580
That's why I had no choice
but to change the tire.

Yes, I was pretty worried.

Don't do this again.

251
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,730
Su Wen always says

252
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:42,820
that I have low EQ

253
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:44,970
and I am opinionated

254
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,490

255
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,020
I'd always infuriate others.

256
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,300
I know my personality isn't likable.

257
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,970
But I can't change it

258
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,130

259
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,250
Why did you stop applying the ointment?

260
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,660
I think you're pretty nice.

261
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,210
You always say I'm nice.

262
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,850
How nice?

263
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,700
Everything about you is nice.

264
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:29,700
I'm not done yet.

265
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,900
I can do it myself.

266
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,300
You should head back and get some rest.

267
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:41,850
I'm so exhausted.

268
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:42,940
I want to sleep

269
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,970
and get a good rest.

270
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,210
If there's anything,

271
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,780
can we leave it until tomorrow?

272
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:51,780
Do you need me to keep you company?

273
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,780
It's okay.

274
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,490
All right.

275
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,580
But remember

276
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,180
that your hand

277
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,970
can't come into contact with water.

278
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:05,850
Do you hear me?

279
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,660
Yes.

280
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:30,660
I'll make a move, then.

281
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,300
Don't let it come into contact with water.

282
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,300
Aren't you tired of instant noodles?

283
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:51,850
It's convenient.

284
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,300
Throw it out and eat this.

285
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,660
Why did you buy so many?

286
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,580
Come in and eat with me.

287
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,580
You can go after you finish eating.

288
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:10,820
It's okay. You can have it all.

289
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,900
Get some rest after you finish eating.

290
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,020
All right. You can get back to work now.

291
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,610
Eat it

By the way,

give your car key to me.

I'll get your tire fixed.

298

It's okay.

299

No need to be shy with me.

300

Okay.

Thank you, then.

302

Lest someone overthinks.

303
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,180
The client's information in this case

304
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,130
is highly classified.

305
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,370
It's of Level 5A.

306
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,130
The boss is keeping a close watch.

307
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,580
No more than three people in the company

308

have access to the information.

309
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,780
It's beyond my capability.

310
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,060
Boss,

311
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,300
it's taboo in this line of work

312
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,900
to investigate our clients.

313
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,820
I'm not in the same field as you guys.

314

317
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,660
Okay.

318

Is everything okay on your side?

319

I'm glad to hear that.

320
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:27,130
The company

321
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:27,820
received a call

322
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,940
saying we have a new case.

323
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,660
It's in Shanghai.

324
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,090
They need an attorney.

325
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,360
Let's work together again.

326
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,300
The payment is really good.

327
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,330
They want us to be there quickly.

328
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,330
I'll pass.

329
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,780
Come on. Why don't...

330
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,780
Let's drink first.

331
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,330
Let's welcome Wu for being here.

332
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,820
Thank you, Wu, for taking the time

333
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,450
to come and visit us

334
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,540
despite your busy schedule.

335
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,610
Okay.

336
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:48,850
Let's drink.

337
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:49,450
Have a drink, Boss.

338
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,330
Cheers.

339
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:52,660
You guys can drink up.

340
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,300

I just don't get it.

Why are you trying to find out

345
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,210
if Ruan Zhenzhen's old house
is going to be demolished

out of a sudden?

347
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,730
I suspect

348
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:18,580
she didn't go back to her hometown.

349
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,420
Where did she go, then?

I don't know.

00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,090
I can't believe

352
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,210
she's still wary of you.

353
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,420
She's not.

00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,180
She just doesn't want me to know.

Isn't she being wary of you?

we need to leave this place.

Why not?

379

Wasn't she the one

who introduced that impostor to you?

381

No reason. It's just impossible.

If Su Wen is untrustworthy,

Put everything else aside.

398

Just ignore who these people are

about what motive they have.

Just stop investigating already.

402
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:10,770
It's meaningless
