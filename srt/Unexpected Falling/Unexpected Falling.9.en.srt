before we decide whether to call the police.

106

at this moment,

142
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,840
it'll create a storm.

143

If someone like Xu Youning appears again,

144

Not that easy.

151

That depends if the boss

is willing to let you go.

153
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,280
Even if he lets you leave,

154
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,760
you need to find a way to get the money out.

155
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,200
Otherwise, you can't survive without money

156

160
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,220
But the boss...

161
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,020
I will

162

talk to the boss.

163
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,540
You only need to remember one thing.

164
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,570
You must not get the boss

Give me the bag.

You're right. Who did this?

Do they need to work so hard

345
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,370
when you're alone in the car.

346
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:48,330
Can you check something for me?

347
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,300
Do I call 110

348
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,060
or go straight

349
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:51,700
to the police station

350
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,610
to make a police report?

351
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:58,450
The suspect has fled.

352
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,180
So calling 110 is useless.

353
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:02,020
You must go to the police station
to make a report.

354
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,180
But

355
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:09,900
that guy escaped through the fire escape.

356
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,250
There's no surveillance camera there.

357
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,490
So making a police report is pointless too.

358
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,300
This was the guy who stalked me

359
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,020
back in my hometown.

360
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:21,970
You've met him?

361
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:23,700
Twice.

362
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,330
The first time, he followed me back

363
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,020
from the school.

364
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,330
The second time was
when I came back from the cemetery.

365
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,940
He came out

366
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,580
from my grandma's

367
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,490
old house.

368
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,330
We ran into each other

369
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,490
at the alley.

370
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:42,300
I had no idea.

371
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,940
Not only did he come this time,

372
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,370
but he also injured you.

373
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,330
It's just a flesh wound

374
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,130
and is considered a minor injury.

375
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,210
If only you know who he is,

376
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,130
it'll be easier for the police to handle this.

377
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,490
But in this circumstance,

378
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:06,730
they don't have time

379
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:07,700
to handle your case.

380
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,490
You don't own the police force.

381
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,780
He had already followed me twice.

382
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,660
The police wouldn't ignore it.

383
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,970
Are you sure he was the one who stalked you

384
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:20,730
in your hometown?

385
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,020
Did you see his face clearly?

386
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,420
I took a glance today,

387
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,130
and his physical build is similar.

388
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,970
Well, I don't think

389
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:33,370
he was the one who followed you in your hometown.

390
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:34,940
How so?

391
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,180
Won't that be too bold of him?

392
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:38,540
What does he want

393
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,330
by following you three times?

394
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:44,060
It's okay

395
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,700
if we make a police report later.

396
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,980
We should take care of something

397
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:49,890
more important.

398
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,770
Aren't you hungry?

399
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,620
It's already lunchtime.

400
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,580
I have a stomach problem.

401
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,650
I can't starve.

402
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,770
It's starting to hurt now.

403
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,100
I'm really sorry.

404
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,490
I forgot about your stomach problem.

405
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,130
What do you want to eat?

406
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,650
My stomach doesn't feel good now.

407
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,890
I want to have some plain congee.

408
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:16,700
How about we go back to your place?

409
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,220
You don't have to

410
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,170
add anything to the congee.

411
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,130
Just plain congee.

412
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,650
Put these over there.

413
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:40,620
Okay.

414
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:52,940
The trading department

415
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,650
hasn't submitted all of the details.

416
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,370
The trading department
still owes us some information.

417
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:00,130
Sorry, I'll rush them.

418
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:12,730
Not at home?

419
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,420
Where did she go?

420
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:15,860
She didn't tell me.

421
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,010
Can't you just wait there and find out?

422
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,380
I told her I'd wait for her.

423
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:21,930
But she refused.

424
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:22,860
Are you stupid?

425
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,580
Can't you use your brain a little?

426
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,340
She took a spray to the office.

427
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,860
It was because she had a hidden agenda, get it?

428
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,340
She lured you away on purpose

429
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,250
to search the office.

430
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:44,900
You must find out

431
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,140
what exactly she was searching for.

432
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:47,450
I understand.

433
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:56,860
Who was that?

434
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,060
A call from the office.

435
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,620
I think someone's looking for me.

436
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,340
Call them back.

437
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:22,060
Hello?

438
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,290
Hello?

439
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,770
Yes, I'm at the office.

440
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,010
Okay, wait for me.

441
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:30,770
I'll be right over.

442
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,290
Mr. Qiu,

443
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,930
the inspection team needs some information.

444
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:38,250
They want me to send it over.

445
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,620
What do they want?

446
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,060
They want access to some information.

447
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:55,660
I made a copy for you to go through.

448
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,060
[Mr. Fang]

449
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:18,180
Yes, sir.

450
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,210
I'm here.

451
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:21,930
I've always been at the office.

452
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:22,820
What is it?

453
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:25,580
Okay.

454
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,930
I'll be there

455
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:27,660
to report it to you in person.

456
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:35,420
Send

457
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,930
the materials to the inspection team

458
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,010
according to the list

459
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:39,730
right away.

460
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:40,140
Okay.

461
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,860
Put in more work on Ruan Zhenzhen.

462
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,180
Keep a close eye on her.

463
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,140
You can rest assured.

464
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,490
Sorry to keep you waiting.

465
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,210
I should be apologizing

466
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,060
for troubling you to cook.

467
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,210
Don't say that.

468
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:13,450
It's not hard to make some congee.

469
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,450
Do you want some pickle with it?

470
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:21,060
Sure.

471
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:39,620
What about you?

472
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:42,490
You can eat first.

473
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:43,930
I'll get mine later.

474
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,140
What do you want to say?

475
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,970
I think

476
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,620
I should call the police about this.

477
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:18,970
Why?

478
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:22,290
I think someone is targeting me.

479
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:24,860
The one who broke into my house last night

480
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:25,970
and the guy today

481
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,450
should be from the same gang.

482
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,610
Last night?

483
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,010
What happened last night?

484
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,060
When I came back last night,

485
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,180
I noticed someone had broken into my house.

486
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:44,860
But when I brought

487
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,210
the guards back here,

488
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,290
no one was here at all,

489
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:49,730
nor did anything

490
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:50,490
go missing.

491
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:59,180
Are you sure someone broke into your house?

492
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,820
Did you see him?

493
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:06,140
I didn't see anyone.

494
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,290
But I can feel it.

495
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:09,660
And

496
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,010
the door wasn't locked.

497
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:14,690
Also,

498
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:16,340
I am sure I locked the door

499
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,620
before I left the house yesterday morning.

500
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,450
I turned the lock twice.

501
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,860
But when I returned last night,

502
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:22,660
the door was closed

503
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,210
and unlocked.

504
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,250
So someone must have entered the house.

505
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,690
When I came home,

506
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:29,380
that person must be inside the house.

507
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:31,290
Still inside the house?

508
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,140
Yes, he was still in the house.

509
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,290
There was a light in the room. It wasn't bright.

510
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:37,620
It's not from the lamp

511
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:39,250
or light

512
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,340
coming from outside the window.

513
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:42,820
It was another type of light.

514
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:48,140
Something like a flashlight.

515
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,010
Are you sure

516
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:54,820
nothing is missing?

517
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,060
I haven't noticed anything missing at the moment.

518
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,730
You said you locked the door

519
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,380
before you ran away.

520
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,060
When you returned

521
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:04,970
with the guards,

522
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:06,970
the door was also locked.

523
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,420
Yes, it was locked.

524
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:09,930
The key was still in the doorknob.

525
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:17,290
You could have remembered it wrongly.

526
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,290
It's either when you left in the morning,

527
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:20,210
you didn't lock the door.

528
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:22,100
Or

529
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,730
the guy you locked inside your house

530
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,010
was not an ordinary thief.

531
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:29,900
How so?

532
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:36,530
I get it now.

533
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,290
When I returned

534
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:38,970
with the guards,

535
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,420
the door was locked again.

536
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,450
If it was an ordinary thief,

537
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,530
all he could think of when he panicked

538
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:46,450
was to unlock the door and escape

539
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,820
when he was locked in my house.

540
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,250
He wouldn't waste time

541
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:50,770
returning

542
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:51,580
and locking the door.

543
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:53,770
That's right.

544
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,340
So

545
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,290
how did he manage to get out?

546
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,210
He didn't take the elevator

547
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:10,530
or take the fire escape.

548
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,970
I remember clearly

549
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,140
that the sound-activated lights in the fire escape

550
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:14,770
were not on.

551
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,180
No one was in the fire escape at all.

552
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:22,860
Then,

553
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,340
we can only reenact

554
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,490
what happened last night.

555
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,010
