00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,950
I can't take him home by myself.

4
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Anyone here can help us?

5
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,590
I'll go and get someone.

6
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,870
Is there anybody here?

7
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,910
Is there anyone here who can help?

8
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,110
Since you're here,

9
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,720
I should go.

10
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,670
Ruan Zhenzhen.

11
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,520
I don't mean anything ill,

but the lawyer who's with you,

13
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,670
my mom once saw him

14
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,270
sending our neighbor,

15
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,270
a little girl, home.

16
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,390
He is very close

17
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,160
to the girl's aunt.

18
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,110
I just want you

19
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,800
to be extra careful.

20
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,030
Don't let any man take advantage
of your innocence again.

21
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,190
Thank you.

22
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,910
Sober now?

23
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,750
Drink more.

24
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,910
Dear.

25
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,880
Sober up.

26
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,390
Didn't you say you could hold your liquor well?

27
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,160
Didn't you say that?

28
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,750
Why are you sleeping here?

29
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,720
Stop hitting me, dear.

30
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,000
You'll hurt yourself

31
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,390
and the baby.

32
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,720
You still know you will be a father?

33
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,670
Why can't you

34
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,240
pull yourself together?

35
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,600
Why can't you?

36
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,320
Did you forget

37
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,960
what you promised me?

38
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,110
Did you forget

39
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,360
the life

40
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,390
you promised me?

41
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,720
Don't cry.

42
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,270
I'll slap myself.

43
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,390
I fail you.

44
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,070
I suck.

45
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,790
I'm useless.

46
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,320
I fail you and our baby.

47
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,350
I fail you.

48
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,790
I've let you down.

49
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,550
It's all my fault.

50
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,640
I fail you.

51
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,480
I...

52
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,830
Stop.

53
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,920
Stop.

54
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,640
Hurry up.

55
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,720
She's about to finish work soon.

(to the girl's aunt.)

62
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,510
You finished work earlier.

63
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,550
What's the matter?

64
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:44,830
Nothing.

65
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,230
You look pale.

66
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,160
Didn't you promise

67
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,920
that you would take some days off?

68
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,760
I want to work for a month.

69
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,550
If I leave suddenly now,

70
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,270
they will deduct my pay.

71
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,160
Let's go.

72
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,070
You haven't had your dinner, have you?

73
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,070
What about

74
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,110
we go eat something first?

75
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,550
It's okay.

76
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,070
I'm tired. I want to go home.

77
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,390
Okay.

78
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,350
What's up?

79
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,640
Nothing.

80
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,550
What is wrong with this lock?

81
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,470
Can you ask the locksmith

82
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,230
to check

83
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,790
how many keys he gave me?

84
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,520
If he gave you six keys,

85
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,590
you should have six.

86
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,280
I don't see why he would keep one.

87
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,640
Including the one I'm holding,

88
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,550
all five keys are here.

89
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:05,960
That's odd.

90
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,230
It felt heavier

91
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,080
that day.

92
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:10,960
One key is missing?

93
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,710
Shouldn't be.

94
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,280
I remember

95
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,840
as I stormed off,

96
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,280
I tossed the keys

97
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,280
here.

98
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,440
Have you searched this place?

99
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,880
Yes.

100
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,710
I have searched the place.

101
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,350
Come and have a look.

102
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,640
Is this the missing key?

103
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,320
Su Wen is already out of the picture.

104
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,080
And Anhe is stable

105
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,550
at the moment.

106
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,520
It's only Xu Youning

107
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,960
left.

108
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,760
If he exposes

109
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,590
everything,

110
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,960
the higher-ups

111
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,840
will deal with us first.

112
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,350
Then get rid of him as soon as possible.

113
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,670
But he's hiding in the dark now.

114
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,030
It's hard to locate him.

115
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,840
Find a way

116
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,960
to lure him out.

117
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,640
I must have tossed them a bit

118
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,840
so violently that day

119
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,350
that one fell into the crack behind.

120
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,000
I'll leave it here.

121
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,670

(Calling the police won't help.)

126
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,960
(The security footage didn't show anything.)

127
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,320
There's no point in going to the police.

128
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,350
Zhenzhen?

129
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,080
Zhenzhen?

130
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,440
Ruan Zhenzhen.

131
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,110
What's the matter?

132
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,400
I kind of blacked out just now.

133
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,030
Sit down.

134
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,200
Mr. Fang.

135
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,550
How should I lure him out?

136
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,960
Didn't you say Xu Youning

137
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,030
care a lot

138
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:34,880
about his wife?

139
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,880
Yes.

140
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,710
Almost possessive.

141
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,080
Qiu.

142
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,400
It was a rhetorical question.

143
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,080
I was giving you an answer.

144
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,880
Do you feel better now?

145
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:29,790
I'm fine.

146
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:37,880
Don't worry.

147
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,840
It has happened before in the restaurant.

148
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,790
Low blood sugar perhaps.

149
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,280
Get me some sugar from the kitchen.

150
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,550
Where can I find it?

151
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,440
In the cabinet under the stove.

152
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,470
This one?

153
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,440
The left one.

154
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:27,900
It's so sweet.

155
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,090
Quit your job.

156
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,050
I'll bring you to the hospital tomorrow

157
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:34,930
for a proper check-up.

158
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,130
Just to find out what's going on.

159
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,420
I'll quit then.

160
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,020
No need to go to the hospital.

161
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:42,810
I just got discharged from a hospital,

162
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,900
and I have done a check-up.

163
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,570
I think I'm fine. I'm just tired.

164
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,930
My body feels weak.

165
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,730
Is it worth it

166
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:55,730
to torture yourself

167
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,460
for a few coins?

168
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,580
No, thanks.

169
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,060
Eat it.

170
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,580
I don't want to.

171
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,450
Say it again.

172
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,540
Say what?

173
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,660
The first time

174
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:30,540
you met me

00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,690
for the trouble.

348
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,450
Not at all.

349
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:05,970
I

350
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:06,620
should be the one

351
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,620
apologizing.

352
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,610
You have nothing to do with it.

353
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:13,860
Oh.

354
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,930
Since you decided

355
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,010
not to call the police,

356
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:17,900
I feel the need

357
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,820
to remind you

358
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:19,820
to prioritize

359
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,970
your safety.

360
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,140
No matter what happens,

361
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:24,970
you can call me

362
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:25,660
at any time.

363
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,010
Thank you,

364
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,180
Gao Jun.

365
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:36,770
Bye.

366
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:37,730
Bye.

367
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,730
Ms. Zhang, how can I help?

368
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:25,860
Who is in charge of this?

369
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,060
Bring the person here.

370
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,380
I need more details.

371
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:28,860
Noted,

372
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,340
Ms. Zhang.

373
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,530
I'll get the person here.

374
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:32,680
Leave the document here.

375
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:48,930
Zhang.

376
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:50,620
How are you doing, Zhang?

377
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,340
The inspection

378
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,620
will be over soon.

379
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,060
Are you doing all right there?

380
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:57,860
Not bad.

381
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,210
The young ones are motivated,

382
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,380
but they lack experience.

383
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:03,860
Zhang,

384
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,930
show me the list

385
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:06,620
of problems.

386
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,970
I'll take a look for you.

387
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:11,380
Thank you for your offer, Mr. Songrong.

388
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,340
You should go back to your work.

389
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,100
I can

390
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,250
handle my part.

391
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,140
This phone is quite good.

392
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:32,210
It's good for taking selfies.

393
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,340
You don't even need to touch up the photos.

394
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,010
Right, Zhang?

395
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,380
(It's good for taking selfies.)

396
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,100
My friends don't have to worry

397
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,620
about my photo retouching skills anymore.

398
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:51,010
What's new?

399
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,930
Some people

400
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,490
tend to get ahead of themselves.

401
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,930
They don't respect their seniors,

402
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,970
nor do they help their juniors.

403
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,140
If something happens

404
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:20,340
to these people,

405
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:24,820
we will celebrate it,

406
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:27,620
won't we?

407
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,290
Mr. Songrong.

408
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,010
What are you on about?

409
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,450
I

410
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,620
don't understand.

411
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,770
You don't?

412
00:39:58,450 --> 00:39:59,970
I must be too young to understand.

413
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:02,290
I'll need

414
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,250
guidance from a veteran like you.

415
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:08,620
Look.

416
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:10,100
These are the problems

417
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,210
we found out lately.

418
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,450
I count on you to go through them.

419
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,490
Sure, no problem.

420
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:26,860
Well,

421
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,530
you have so much potential.
