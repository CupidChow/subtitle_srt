00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,860
My friend fell sick.

174
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,620
So I'm here to visit him.

175
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,780
What are you doing here?

176
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,980
One of our employees

177
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,780
has been hospitalized.

178
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,340
So I'm here to pay him a visit
on behalf of our company.

179
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,020
Okay. I'll leave you to it.

180
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,580
We can talk later.

181
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,260
Sure.

182
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,740
Mr. Qiu.

183
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,900
You are here to visit Yangyang, right?

184
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,660
He's awake.

185
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:12,860
Yangyang.

186
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,580
Your superior is here to see you again.

187
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,370
Please go in, Mr. Qiu.

188
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,300
-Okay.
-I'll get some water.

189
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:29,700
[Buchuo Antique]

190
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,260
Let's check it out.

191
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,740
What is it? Do you like it?

192
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,340
I wouldn't say that I like it.

193
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,220
But it looks

194
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,900
interesting.

195
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,660
Have you been here before?

196
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,220
I passed by twice.

197
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,660
But I didn't enter the shop.

198
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,740
Come.

199
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,420
Fu.

200
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,220
How did the house hunt go?

201
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,220
I found a house.

202
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,460
But it's a little bit small.

203
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,660
You can't live in it.

204
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,380
I'm still hunting

205
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,460
for a bigger house for you.

206
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,060
-Understood.
-Mister.

207
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:46,900
You have a parcel.

208
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,060
Take a seat.

209
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,060
Let me check it out.

210
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,460
Take a seat.

211
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,380
I prefer standing.

212
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,700
Do you want some water?

213
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,620
No.

214
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,300
Are you looking for a place to rent?

215
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,900
The place that we were staying in is not safe now.

216
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,260
I need to find a new place for Jiu and the others.

217
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,720
Jiu?

218
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,580
Your underlings?

219
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,380
Xu Youning was in debt with their company.

220
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,660
Their company asked them

221
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,660
to investigate this matter together with me.

222
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,780
Where are they?

223
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,020
Didn't you say

224
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:37,780
that you would introduce them to me?

225
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,780
Jiu injured his leg.

226
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,660
Wu and Qi are keeping an eye on Shen Nanqiu.

227
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,140
Shen Nanqiu?

228
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,180
The person who pretended to be Xia Xinliang

229
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,300
told me that it was a woman who hired him.

230
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,340
Based on what we know right now,

231
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,820
the only woman

232
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,820
who's related to Xu Youning

233
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,100
is Shen Nanqiu.

234
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,340
And Shen Nanqiu

235
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,140
has a complicated background.

236
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,020
If we keep an eye on her,

237
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,620
we may be able to find something useful.

238
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:16,940
Hello.

239
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:17,900
Boss.

240
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:18,940
I saw Qiu Zhijian

241
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,900
at the hospital.

242
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,900
Qiu Zhijian?

243
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:21,980
Yes.

244
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,540
Qiu Zhijian went to the hospital to visit Lu Yang.

245
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:24,980
What about Shen Nanqiu?

246
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,420
What is Shen Nanqiu

247
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,660
doing at the hospital?

248
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,500
Shen Nanqiu greeted Qiu Zhijian

249
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,380
when she saw him.

250
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,660
Then, I felt like Qiu Zhijian

251
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,860
was acting very suspiciously.

252
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,900
So I followed him instead.

253
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,380
Enough.

254
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,260
Come back with Wu now.

255
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,340
We'll meet at the usual place.

256
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:43,660
Wu.

257
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,060
Did I do something wrong again?

258
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,620
You are so stupid.

259
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,500
Where are we going?

260
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,620
As I said,

261
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,300
I'll introduce them to you.

262
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,100
Thank you for your support, Mr. Fang.

263
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,380
You are all welcome

264
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,300
to come back to guide us.

265
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,700
Goodbye.

266
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,420
Mr. Shen.

267
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,140
Please see Ms. Zhang out for me.

268
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,260
Yes, Mr. Fang.

269
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,460
Have a safe journey.

270
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,740
Mr. Fang.

271
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,860
I have something

272
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,780
to report to you.

273
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,980
Mr. Fang, go ahead and do what you need to do.

274
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,700
We'll go over there first.

275
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,540
Okay.

276
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,340
Xu Weidong went to Guangzhou

277
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,260
last night.

278
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,660
I need to check

279
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,580
if something has happened.

280
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,500
Okay.

281
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,220
What is it? Tell me.

282
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,300
I've located where he made the call.

283
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,820
It's from a payphone
under Nanzhou Humanity Hospital

284
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,100
that Lu Yang is staying in.

285
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,900
And I went to Lu Yang's ward

286
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,620
to visit him.

287
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,610
I think Lu Yang is acting strange.

288
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,020
They say that he has gone out of his mind.

289
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,220
But it doesn't seem believable.

290
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,420
It looks like

291
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,100
he's faking it.

292
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,060
I think

293
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,780
that either

294
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,100
Lu Yang is colluding with Xu Youning,

295
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,460
or

296
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,660
he is...

297
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,940
He is

298
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,100
Xu Youning himself,

299
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,460
right?

300
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,140
But how can we confirm that?

301
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,700
We have to confirm it with his wife.

302
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,260
We've

303
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,580
failed the first time.

304
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,020
We can't do it the second time.

305
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,260
No one is willing to do it.

306
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:12,900
Pay more money then.

307
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,500
If the pay is high enough,

308
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,220
someone will do it.

309
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,020
Okay.

310
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,660
I'll get it done.

311
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,740
When I was at the hospital,

312
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,540
I also saw...

313
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,060
Wait a second.

314
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,380
Hello?

315
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,660
Can you talk now?

316
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,140
Go ahead.

317
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,660
I went to visit a friend at the hospital today.

318
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,460
Do you know who I saw?

319
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:49,940
Who?

320
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,260
Mr. Qiu from Jinshang.

321
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,060
He was standing in front of a ward

322
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,060
without going in. He seemed suspicious.

323
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,660
I didn't know what he was up to.

324
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,220
Okay.

325
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,540
I have to hang up now.

326
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:12,820
Qiu.

327
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,660
Where were we just now?

328
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,660
I wanted to say

329
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,380
that I saw

330
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,500
Shen Nanqiu at the hospital.

331
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,020
Okay.

332
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,980
How's my service, Jiu?

333
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,060
Do you want to eat it?

334
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,260
Don't be shy.

335
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,100
Okay now. Just serve the food.

336
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:39,780
Come here now.

337
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,820
Okay.

338
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,220
-Come.
-Let's go.

339
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,060
Serve these skewers first.

340
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:43,660
Let me do it.

341
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,140
I'll take these.

342
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,980
Here you are.

343
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,380
Eat them while they are hot.

344
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:06,900
He's the one who followed me

345
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,940
when I was in my hometown.

346
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,100
That's me.

347
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,260
I'm Jiu.

348
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,980
He's the one who changed the lock.

349
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,410
That was me. I'm Qi.

350
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,500
Nice to meet you.

351
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,740
Wu.

352
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,580
I'm different from them.

353
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,780
I'm a decent lawyer.

354
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,260
I don't do anything that's against the law.

355
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,860
Wu, Qi, Jiu.
(*five, seven, nine)

356
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,900
What about Liu, Ba, and Shi?
(*six, eight, ten)

357
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,260
Who are Yi, Er, San, and Si?
(*one, two, three, four)

358
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,620
Well,

359
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,820
our boss has the character of four in his name.

360
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,740
So, we start with Wu, five,

361
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,260
to show him respect.

362
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,420
It's easier for the operation too.

363
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,580
He has the character of four in his name?

364
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,060
So Tan Shen is your fake name?

365
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,940
His name is Tan Sitiao.

366
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,340
What?

367
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,300
What is his name?

368
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,060
What is it?

369
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,300
Tan Sitiao.
(*"Si" means "four")

370
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,340
Just take a look at it.

371
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,180
[Tan Sitiao]

372
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,700
Tan Sitiao.

373
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,020
It's a good name.

374
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,820
As I said,

375
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,220
I'll be honest with you.

376
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,500
Come on.

377
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,740
Let me open a bottle of beer for you.

378
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,900
She doesn't drink.

379
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,740
You are so inattentive.

380
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,660
Zhen.

381
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,380
Come on.

382
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,220
Jiu.

383
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,580
How's your leg?

384
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,020
It's painful. More painful than yesterday.

385
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,380
Since your leg is in pain,

386
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,500
you shouldn't drink.

387
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,220
Okay? You have to drive.

388
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,060
I'll drink for you.

389
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,460
You brat.

390
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,700
Where's your compassion?

391
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,580
Are you going to ask a cripple to drive?

392
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,300
You are on a probation period now.

393
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,780
You have to show us your worth.

394
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,980
I almost forgot if you didn't mention this.

395
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,260
The two of you

396
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,420
didn't even defend me

397
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,260
yesterday.

398
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,300
I had treated you so well

399
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,060
for nothing.

400
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,100
To me,

401
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,300
you are like my own kids.

♪The traces left by you♪

403
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,660
Let me tell you.

404
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,540
The incident yesterday

405
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,580
was obviously

406
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,740
a trick to lure us away.

407
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,100
They didn't want me

408
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,300
to go back to our boss at all.

409
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,420
They just wanted to capture Ruan.

410
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,820
I'm sure that was their plan.

411
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,660
Think about it.

412
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,660
There's no reason for the company
to catch Zhenzhen.

413
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,420
Kidnapping someone on the street
is a serious offense.

414
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,220
No matter how bold your company is,

415
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,180
they wouldn't dare to do that.

416
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,180
They also kidnapped me last time.

417
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,900
It's different.

418
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,260
You are their employee.

419
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,460
They have something on you.

420
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,300
They know that you won't call the police.

423

00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,380
Okay. Thank you.

425
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,140
I'll be there now.

426
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,660
Okay.

427
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,620
Sir, madam.

428
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,380
Mrs. Xu will be here soon.

429

Please wait for a moment.

we'll talk about financial aid,

okay?

433
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,540
Okay.

434
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,300
Okay. I have things to do.

435
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,620
Please pardon me for a moment.

436
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,020
Later,

437
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,940
don't talk too much. Let me do the talk.

438
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,860
We need to keep the money

439
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,780
for Youning.

440
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,180
In case Ruan Zhenzhen loses her conscience

441
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:18,940
and abandons Youning.

442
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,260
Youning is not a registered citizen.

443
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,140
He's not protected by the law.

444
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,540
Got it?

445
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,740
I'll go with you.

446
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,420
Why?

447
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,940
I'm not there to pick a fight.

448
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,500
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

449
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,700
There are so many people in the company.

450
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,620
Just wait here.

451
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,060
According to the company's rules,

452
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,340
the three of you

453
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,660
need to go to the Notary Public

454
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,420
to be notarized as the inheritors.

455
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,820
After that, bring us the document

456
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,620
and we'll sign an agreement.

457
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,580
Then,

458
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,980
we can transfer the money

459
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,060
into the bank account

460
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,220
of your choice.

461
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,060
Is there a requirement for a bank account?

462
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,060
The bank account

463
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,140
needs to belong to the inheritor.

464
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,540
Can you pay us in cash?

465
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,620
I'm afraid

466
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,420
I can't do that.

467
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,420
We can only do a bank transfer.

468
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,460
If we pay you in cash,

469
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,700
we can't tally up the numbers.

470
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,660
Zhenzhen's account

471
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,100
is suspended by the court.

472
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,220
She can't use it.

473
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,900
You can transfer the money to my account.

474
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,340
Zhenzhen,

475
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,700
you can trust us.

476
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,820
When they wire the money to me,

477
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,580
I can give it to you in cash.

478
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,020
Don't worry.

479
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,740
You'll get everything you deserve.

480
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,220
We should get the notarization done first.

481
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,780
We'll discuss other things later.

482
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,460
Okay.

483
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,580
You can

484
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,980
discuss it with each other then.

485
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,900
Ms. Ruan.

486
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,860
Please wait.

487
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,460
I need to talk to you.

488
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,420
Let's go.

489
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:55,780
But...

490
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,660
Ma'am,

00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,780
Okay.

494

Let's go.

495
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,340
This way, please.

496
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,020
Do you think

497
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:13,860
they will do something

498
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,180
behind our backs?

499
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,660
Drink some water.

500
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,900
(I'm close with Mr. Yan)

501
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,780
from Anhe Travel.

502
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,540
He told me that you are looking for a job.

503
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,140
Coincidentally,

504

Jinshang Capital

505
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,660
is hiring now.

506
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,660
If you are interested,

507
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,300
you can send me your resume.

508
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,820
What kind of position is it?

509
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,780
It's a position

You'll be working in my department.

512
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,140
there's something

513
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,020
that I need to tell you.

514
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,940
You are under a lawsuit right now.

515
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,260
So I can't

516
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,340
officially hire you.

517
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,020
You don't have to worry about your salary.

518
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,180
You'll be paid the same.

519
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,900
Considering your current situation,

520
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,860
I'll come up with a way

521
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,700
to pay you in cash.

522
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:32,980
As for your work hour,

523
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,220
you can have a flexible one.

524
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,100
If you need to do anything, go ahead.

525
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,020
Just give me a notice.

526
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,700
Don't worry.

527
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,620
It's just a temporary collaboration between us.

528
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,260
He'll look for the money

529
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,500
while I'll look for the list.

530
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:00,620
Yes.

531
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,500
He says that it's a list of clients.

532
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,020
For the time being,
I don't know anything about the list.

533
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,900
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

534
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,940
Keep in touch. Bye.

535
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:28,940
What took you so long?

536
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,340
Jinshang has offered me a job.

537
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,260
What did you say?

538
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,460
Jinshang has offered me a job

539
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,260
in the administrative department.

540
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:38,940
Why?

541
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:40,820
On the surface,

542
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,220
the company is trying to take care
of the employee's family.

543
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,900
But I don't know what their real intention is.

544
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,460
What did you say then?

545
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,340
I accepted their offer.

546
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,220
Can't you tell

547
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,540
that they are trying to keep you
under their watch?

548
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,500
So what?

549
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,580
I can find more information by working with them.

550
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,620
You can't work here.

551
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:01,820
Because

552
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,660
we don't know

553
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,500
who your kidnappers from last night are.

554
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,740
What if they were sent by Jinshang?

555
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,140
If you work for them,

556
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,460
you'll be entering the tiger's lair.

557
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,940
We can't get anything if we don't take the risk.

558
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,700
What if

559
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,740
you are chewed up by the tiger?

560
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,740
I'm even dancing with the wolves now.

561
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,780
I'm not afraid of a tiger's lair.

562
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,180
I'm not a bad person.

563
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,140
And I used to think

564
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,700
that you are a good person.

565
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,780
Who were you calling just now?

566
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,540
A friend.

567
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,180
Who?

568
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,660
You are too controlling.

569
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,460
I thought that we were supposed

570
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,220
to be honest with each other.

571
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,060
Being honest with each other

572
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,140
doesn't mean that you can

573
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,020
invade my privacy.

574
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,500
Ruan Zhenzhen, I hope you'll understand

575
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,380
that the friend you trust

576
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,740
may not be a true friend.

577
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,740
Just be frank.

578
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,500
Who were you talking to on the phone just now?

579
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,420
As I said, a friend.

580
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,620
Do you mean Gao Jun?

581
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,500
Why do you suddenly mention him?

582
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,060
That day, you said that you went back

583
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:11,980
to clean Xu Youning's grave.

584
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,660
But you actually

585
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,380
went to look for Gao Jun at the law firm

586
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,620
to verify my identity, right?

587
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,460
You unplugged

588
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,260
the dashcam

589
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:20,900
in your car

590
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:22,940
because you wanted to hide

591
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,980
where you went.

592
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,860
That day, I really thought

593
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,700
that you just wanted to change my tire for me.

594
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,740
That's not the point.

595
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,660
Really?

596
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,900
What's the point, then?

597
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,100
The point is

598
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,460
that you can't simply

599
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,300
trust anyone.

600
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,620
Including Gao Jun.

601
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,980
When it comes to this matter,

602
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,820
he's not more trustworthy than me.

603
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:02,660
Thank you for the warning.

604
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,980
Can we end this conversation now?

605
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,620
About the financial aid,

606
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,700
have you thought about how to split it?

607
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,460
The company doesn't care about that.

608
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,940
They'll just transfer the money to an account.

609
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,420
Then, we'll split it ourselves.

610
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,740
I can't use my account now.

611
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,300
So they can only

612
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,140
transfer the money

613
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:02,940
into the account of Xu Youning's parents.

614
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,460
I think I won't get anything in the end.

615
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,860
But there's a solution to that.

616
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,300
What solution is that?

617
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,100
The court is only suspending

618
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:14,860
your account temporarily.

619
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,340
You can go to the bank

620
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,580
to open another account.

621
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,540
Xu Youning's parents

622
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,180
won't agree

623
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,420
for them to transfer the money into my account.

624
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,260
What can you do then?

625
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,100
You have to discuss it with them.

626
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,740
They can have all the money.

627
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,580
You are what they call

628
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,700
the generous poor, right?

629
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,460
Keep your eyes on the road.

630
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,580
(Do you call collecting debt, drinking, fighting)

631
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,460
