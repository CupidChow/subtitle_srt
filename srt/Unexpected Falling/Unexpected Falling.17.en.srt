175
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,820
[Pay what you owe]

176
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,320
The police are here.

177
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:29,910
When...

178
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,080
When did you call the police?

179
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:31,910
Ma'am.

180
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,400
We didn't do anything to you.

181
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,320
The bedroom.

182
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,000
Since this is

183
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,960
your first offense,

184
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,080
be quiet and follow me.

185
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,440
Over there!

186
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,280
Hurry. Over here.

187
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,350
Over here.

188
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,760
He can't fit inside.

189
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:14,880
Come here.

190
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,550
Please give me a minute.

191
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,760
You are...

192
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,640
Are you Ruan Zhenzhen?

193
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,960
I am Wang Junhai,
the officer in charge of this area.

194
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,320
They are

195
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,350
Officer Chen and Officer Xing

196
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,230
from the criminal investigation unit.

197
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,320
Hello.

198
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,030
We are detectives

199
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,440
from Nanzhou City,
Haidi District's public security bureau.

200
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,590
She is Xing Na.

201
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,620
I am Chen.

202
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,250
Why are you squirming around?

203
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,460
The clothes are wet.

204
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,540
Take a seat.

205
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,780
I'm scared!

206
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,370
Have some water, please.

207
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:46,980
Thank you.

208
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:48,490
I'm sorry.

209
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,780
I was doing my laundry

210
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,250
and didn't hear the doorbell.

211
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,660
We came here

212
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,460
to get

213
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,690
some information from you.

214
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,300
What is it?

215
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,810
Two days ago,

216
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,300
on the 15th of March in the morning,

217
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,690
did Lu Yang

218
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,580
come here?

219
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:11,820
Yes.

220
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,820
Why was he here?

221
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,420
He was here...

222
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,060
to give me something.

223
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,090
What thing?

224
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,060
The things my husband left behind.

225
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,130
Those things

226
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,210
were in his office.

227
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,210
A while ago,

228
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,210
I went to clean up the place,

229
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,730
but I didn't bring them back.

230
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,660
So he sent the items to me.

231
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,250
Did you talk about anything?

232
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,940
Nothing much.

233
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,700
I thanked him.

234
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,660
He asked me

235
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,900
if I have any trouble in my life

236
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:49,780
and said I could tell him

237
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,780
if I had any.

238
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,370
What next?

239
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,060
Nothing else.

240
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,490
He didn't

241
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:03,450
stay for too long.

242
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,300
Didn't you talk about anything else?

243
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:13,130
We didn't.

244
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:17,900
Your husband

245
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,450
passed away in a car accident not long ago,

246
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,250
correct?

247
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,060
Yes.

248
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,020
Where did

249
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,970
the accident happen?

250
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,330
At the outer ring road.

251
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:29,700
After the accident,

252
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,540
what happened to the car?

253
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,580
I was not feeling well back then.

254
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,900
My relatives helped me deal with the car.

255
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,820
I heard

256
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,020
the car was badly damaged

257
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,700
and it was wrecked.

258
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,210
It was sent to

259
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,210
an impound yard.

260
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,610
Do you know

261
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,330
where that place is?

262
00:18:58,970 --> 00:18:59,660
When Lu Yang

263
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,730
came here two days ago,

264
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,330
did he

265
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,020
mention the car to you?

266
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,900
He did.

267
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,540
What did he say?

268
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,250
He didn't say much.

269
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,090
He asked me

270
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,300
where the car is parked at.

271
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,020
What next?

272
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,540
Nothing else.

273
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,210
Why did he

274
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,180
ask you where the car is?

275
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:30,730
He didn't tell me.

276
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,540
He simply asked.

277
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,450
I didn't ask anything else.

278
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,780
Officer Chen.

279
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,060
Can I ask

280
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,490
if you are asking these questions

281
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,540
because something happened?

282
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:47,700
Have you been staying in your house

283
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,090
after Lu Yang left?

284
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,900
After Lu Yang left,

285
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,610
I drove

286
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,020
to the impound yard.

287
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,900
Why did you go there?

288
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,850
Here's the thing.

289
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:08,300
My husband

290
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:09,580
had a key pouch

291
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,850
that he always brought with him.

292
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,060
It went missing after the accident.

293
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,700
Lu Yang mentioned the car,

294
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:18,580
so I thought

295
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,450
it might

296
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,420
still be inside the car.

297
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,580
I went to look for it.

298
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,300
A key pouch?

299
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,180
What kind of key pouch was it?

300
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,900
Please wait for a while.

301
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,730
It looks the same as this one.

302
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,020
On the day of the accident,

303
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,330
I gave him a new one in the morning.

304
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:05,780
The new one

305
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,820
has been missing since then.

306
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,090
Did you find the new key pouch

307
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,090
in the car?

308
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,580
The car was wrecked.

309
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,970
I simply searched for it,

310
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,130
but I couldn't find it.

311
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,020
I felt sad,

312
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,420
so I left.

313
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,300
When did you come back?

314
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,180
What time was it?

315
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,970
I didn't notice.

316
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:38,660
Around afternoon.

317
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,250
How did you come back?

318
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,180
I took a taxi.

319
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,130
A taxi?

320
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,300
Didn't you drive there?

321
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,060
Yes.

322
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,610
I drove there,

323
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,420
but...

324
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,300
I didn't drive back.

325
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:57,700
Why?

326
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,020
Why didn't you drive back?

327
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,090
Because...

328
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,180
I saw how badly wrecked

329
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,250
Youning's car was.

330
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,660
It pained me to see that,

331
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,490
so I stayed in the car for a while.

332
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,730
I realized I was still feeling bad,

333
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,610
so I dared not drive my car.

334
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,370
Officer Chen.

335
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,780
What happened?

336
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,130
Lu Yang was assaulted

337
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,370
in the impound yard.

338
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,900
When did it happen?

339
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,540
Is he badly injured?

340
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,180
He's still in a coma.

341
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,580
Which hospital is he in?

342
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,130
Can I visit him?

343
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,180
No one can visit him at the moment.

344
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:40,970
All right.

345
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:42,820
That's all for today.

346
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:44,450
Sorry for disturbing you.

347
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,300
