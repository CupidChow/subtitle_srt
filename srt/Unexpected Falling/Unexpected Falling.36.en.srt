00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,040
Do you know

4
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,760
who called the ambulance for you?

5
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,510
Lu Yang, that was the second time
I've saved your life.

6
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,160
It's okay if you won't talk to me.

7
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,960
I know everything.

8
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,630
What do you know?

9
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,160
I know who attacked you.

10
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,110
I know why you're covering up

11
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,190
for him.

12
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,240
I even know what you're looking for.

13
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,110
I know everything

14
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,110
there is to know.

15
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,960
Do you think

16
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,750
I'm bluffing?

17
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,630
Xia Xinliang.

18
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,110
Xia Xinliang

19
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,320
is the relative in your ward, right?

20
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,470
He's my relative, so what?

21
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,720
He's also your accomplice.

22
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,110
You took the key pouch

23
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,030
from the crash scene.

24
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,190
You and Xia Xinliang

25
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,440
broke into my house twice.

26
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,630
But you found nothing.

27
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:18,960
So you tried your luck

28
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,000
at the impound yard.

29
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,880
You two

30
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,670
had a quarrel there

31
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,440
over a certain matter.

32
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,110
He wounded you.

33
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,800
Your mind was already clear,

34
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,240
but you pretended not to remember.

35
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,720
There could only be two reasons.

36
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:46,670
One,

37
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,550
you couldn't handle the police interrogation.

38
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,270
Two,

39
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,600
you're worried

40
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Xia Xinliang might take revenge.

41
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,360
You knew Xu Youning

42
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,030
had something else

43
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,910
other than the money.

44
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,910
That was why you and Xia Xinliang

45
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,910
were looking for it.

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,470
Correct?

47
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,160
You found something

48
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,000
at the impound yard.

49
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,880
You had a fight over it.

50
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,350
But unfortunately, the most important piece

51
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,440
still eludes both of you.

52
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,350
Am I right?

53
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,720
Do you know why?

54
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,320
That list of name

55
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,830
was never left inside the car

56
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,880
by Xu Youning.

57
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,950
He carried it on himself.

58
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,600
He's still alive.

59
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,390
Yes, you heard it right.

60
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,790
Rest well.

61
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,920
I'll visit you again.

62
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,550
Let's go.

63
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,000
Sure.

64
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,390
That's all?

65
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,000
I got the answer

66
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,040
I came for.

67
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,270
By the way,

68
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,320
I have another question for him.

69
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,760
Wait here, will you?

70
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,110
Okay.

71
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,000
Is Shen Nanqiu

72
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,110
involved as well?

73
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:19,670
So long.

74
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,390
What did you ask?

75
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,270
I asked if he knew

76
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,500
who tried to harm him last night

77
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,390
or if there was any suspect.

78
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,760
What did he tell you?

79
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:36,760
He said no.

80
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,270
The enemy is cunning.

81
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
They left no trace behind.

82
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:41,760
Let's go.

83
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,230
Let's go.

84
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,160
You said

85
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,510
Xu Youning is still alive.

86
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,550
Do you believe it?

87
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,760
I think you just

88
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,510
made up the story for Lu Yang.

89
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,000
I knew you wouldn't believe it.

90
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,640
Everyone must think

91
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,600
I have lost my mind.

92
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,760
But Gao Jun...

93
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,760
I really do feel

94
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,000
that he is alive.

95
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,880
I lied to Lu Yang

96
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,600
about knowing everything

97
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,550
there was to know.

98
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,440
At this point,

99
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,430
aside from the possibility
that Xu Youning is alive,

100
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,400
we've lost all the leads.

101
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,350
We are clueless.

102
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:41,710
Zhenzhen.

103
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,520
I think

104
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,350
you should drop the investigation.

105
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,000
Focus on the lawsuit.

106
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,000
If you lose the first lawsuit,

107
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,080
I'll help with the appeal.

108
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,200
Thanks, but that won't be necessary.

109
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,110
I can help her.

110
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,440
Hello. I am Tan Shen.

111
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,640
I'm Gao Jun.

112
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,550
It's a pleasure.

113
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:12,880
It's an honor.

114
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,110
Why are you here?

115
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,320
Are you stalking me?

116
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:27,840
No.

117
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,080
Jiu is getting discharged today.

118
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,350
I'm here for the paperwork.

119
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,640
Are you free tonight, Mr. Gao?

120
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,960
Care for dinner together?

121
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,440
I have an appointment.
Another day, perhaps.

122
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,320
Very well. Another day.

123
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,960
Mr. Gao, you should hurry back to your work.

124
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,590
I'll drive Ruan Zhenzhen home.

125
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,440
I won't take up any more of your time.

126
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,150
Keep in touch.

127
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,910
Okay. Let's call it a day.

Gao Jun was acting strange?

144

seemed different today

00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,710
I had only told him

159
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,520
about Lu Yang's attack.

160
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,320

I was almost abducted.

I'd had several close calls?

was Su Wen.

346
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:10,740
And of course,

347
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,790
due to certain reasons,

348
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,670
we couldn't be together.

349
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,190
But no matter how many years have passed,

350
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,500
this woman will always own a place

351
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,140
in my heart.

352
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,140
How shameless can you be?

353
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,030
If I were your wife,

354
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,220
I'd slap you with every bit of strength I had.

355
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:32,860
Think however you want.

356
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,030
Investigate however you want.

357
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:39,670
Thanks.

358
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,190
Know this,

359
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,190
whatever you are looking into,

360
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,260
stay out of

361
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,790
Xu Youning's case.

362
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,590
The stake is too high.

363
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,340
It's too late. I already got involved.

364
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,030
What do you mean?

365
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:03,030
What's wrong? Are you nervous?

366
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:03,430
No, are you...

367
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:06,950
Are we meeting

368
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,710
because you want to declare war on me?

369
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,550
What war?

370
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:12,980
I am here to propose

371
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,220
a partnership.

372
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,260
Do you trust Su Wen that much?

373
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:26,190
Yes.

374
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,260
I've known her for 20 years.

375
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:30,950
I know her well.

376
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,460
She has

377
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,460
a pure heart.

378
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:36,790
Did it ever cross your mind

379
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,190
that people might change?

380
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,740
Not Su Wen.

381
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,910
Have you made up your mind?

382
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,790
How can I know

383
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,030
I wouldn't

384
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,430
be in harm's way?

385
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,500
If I get what I want,

386
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,310
you will be in no harm.

387
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,670
Yan Xiaowen.

388
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,100
You know very well

389
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,260
about my condition.

390
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,590
Ruan Zhenzhen's kidney

391
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,260
has been in me

392
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,460
for over a decade.

393
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,220
It's on its last leg.

394
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:41,830
The clock

395
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,430
is already ticking for me.

396
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,710
Justice

397
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,670
doesn't mean anything to me.

398
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:47,860
Money

399
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,190
is the one thing that keeps me alive.

400
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,220
Isn't that right?

401
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:57,860
Be my partner.

402
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,790
If I get my money, I won't come after you.

403
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,790
What if Su Wen wants money?

404
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,070
Money?

405
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,030
Whatever. Forget about Su Wen.

406
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,740
Look at this!

407
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:13,460
Where are you going?

408
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,260
Where are you going?

409
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,460
You can't go into the water.

410
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,500
Why not?

411
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,910
The water is too cold for you.

412
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,910
It's already April, it's not that cold.

413
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,380
Everyone is in the water.

414
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,100
Come on,

415
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,550
just let me try it out.

416
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,100
We don't see this every day.

417
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,070
Just let me go, old man.

418
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,380
Not a chance.

419
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,190
It's only

420
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,670
glowing plankton.

421
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,740
What's so special about it?

422
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,260
You're not a kid anymore.

423
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:43,500
And you're still recovering.

424
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,070
Must you act like a child

425
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,030

00:23:59,030 --> 00:23:59,430
I'm alright.

431
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:00,980

there is nowhere for me to hide.

You're not a murderer.

The police won't waste time on you.

449
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,830
But I blackmailed Fang Jianshe.

450
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,460
It was Xu Youning who did it.

451
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,030
It has nothing to do with you.

452
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,310
Fang Jianshe is no fool!

453
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,950
He will trace everything back to me.

454
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,460
Hello. Please have a look.

455
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:35,950
Americano.

456
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:36,830
Yes.

457
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,380
Wire me the money as soon as possible.

458
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,790
I am skipping town.

459
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:44,980
Listen.

460
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,380
Fang Jianshe

461
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,620
only gave us 20 million yuan.

462
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,340
The money is all in an overseas account.

463
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,260
How do I wire the money?

464
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:53,710
So what do we do now?

465
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,100
If you want to skip town,

466
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,100
I might as well

467
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,260
help you get the proper paperwork.

468
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,430
When the storm settles,

469
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:04,590
you can come back.

470
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,430
And the money?

471
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,910
If you get out,

472
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,100
the money in that account

473
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,100
will be all yours.

474
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,550
Fang Jianshe is contacting

475
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,830
the smugglers.

476
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,190
He wants to run away.

477
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,260
I'll stall him as much as I can.

478
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:21,860
You need to pull your weight.

479
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,830
Make sure you get some money out of him.

480
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:24,950
We don't have

481
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,310
Xu Youning's list!

482
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,590
My bluffs are not enough!

483
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,380
Here you go.

484
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,500
Just make a few phone calls.

485
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:39,950
It's that simple.

486
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,460
Get as much as you can out of him.

487
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,500
Understood?

488
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:47,380
Fine. I'll keep trying.

489
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:12,430
What is it?

490
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,100
I told you not to go into the water.

491
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,140
You had it coming.

492
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,670
Did you treat An Ruiyun

493
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,430
this way?

494
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,190
You are not her.

495
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,190
How so?

496
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:37,670
I had never liked her.

497
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,100
I'd never do

498
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,260
anything intimate with her.

499
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,500
What do you like about me?

500
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,070
No idea.

501
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,950
You always say that I'm not rational enough.

502
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,710
But the truth is, you're the irrational one.

503
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,550
I am a woman

504
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,430
in her 30s,

505
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,860
I'm not healthy,

506
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,100
I have a bad temper,

507
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,620
I have no professional skills,

508
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,500
and I am knee-deep in debt.

509
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,670
What do you see in me?

510
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,100
The similar background.

511
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,950
What's similar?

512
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,670
I have neither a house nor a car,
and you are knee-deep in debt.

513
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:52,190
Silly.

514
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,030
Don't stay up too late.

515
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:08,460
A little more chitchat?

516
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,030
Just hit the sack.

517
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,220
This is serious.

518
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,500
Are you saying

519
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,590
you think that

520
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,550
Xia Xinliang was impersonating Xu Youning?

521
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,860
Yes. You Gang told me

522
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,140
he overheard Xia Xinliang

523
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,260
blackmailing someone on the phone.

524
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,910
He seemed to be using

525
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,140
Xu Youning's way of speaking.

526
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,670
That means

527
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,620
Xia Xinliang and Lu Yang didn't find

528
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,140
the clientele list at the impound yard.

529
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,140
Therefore,

530
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,460
in order to keep blackmailing Jinshang,

531
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,950
they must make it look

532
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,550
as if Xu Youning is still alive.

533
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,190
Am I right?

534
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,740
They are either blackmailing Qiu Zhijian

535
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,380
or Fang Jianshe.

536
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,340
It has to be them.

537
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,220
You knew

538
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,310
that Xu Youning was an impostor,

539
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,710
why did you tell Gao Jun

540
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:54,950
he is still alive?

541
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,500
So they'd fight each other.

542
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,190
Good night.

543
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:13,670
You look pretty,

544
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,830
but your personality...

545
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,430
What's with my personality?

546
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,910
You're mean.

547
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,190
Thanks for the compliment.

548
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,260
When we are looking

549
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,460
for a certain target,

550
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:09,670
we focus

551
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:10,790
on the target.

552
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,380
But before we shoot,

553
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,430
we focus

554
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:14,670
on the iron sight.

555
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,500
But the target is blurry.

556
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,790
That's right.

557
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,140
If the target is blurry,

558
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,140
can we hit the mark?

559
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,830
What are you staring at?

560
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,260
Sometimes,

561
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,140
the process comes before the outcome.

562
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:48,790
It's just like

563
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,140
the case we're investigating.

564
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,950
Your target is the money.

565
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,380
Do you realize

566
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,220
you've changed

567
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:54,830
in the process

568
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:55,950
of hunting it down?

569
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,550
So,

570
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,100
the money doesn't matter.

571
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,710
What matter is

572
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,100
what you learn and your changes.

573
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,740
We're talking about 40 million yuan.

574
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,070
You take it too lightly.

575
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,030
No worries when overwhelmed.

576
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,190
Yan,

577
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,030
load the gun for her.

578
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,030
Remember, enjoy the process.

579
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:26,710
The outcome

580
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,980
usually comes with surprises.

581
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:36,910
Why is he

582
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:37,790
standing there all the time

583
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,190
like a third wheel?

584
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,380
He should be more sensible.

585
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,020
That's the rule here.

586
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,950
Are you new here?

587
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:51,420
Quick!

588
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,070
Watching them makes me want to be in love.

589
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:06,590
Hello?

590
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:36,590
This is the line I mentioned.

591
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,590
Mr. Tan is busy,

592
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,220
so he can't be here.

593
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,150
Mom.

594
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,150
Mr. Tan

595
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,830
has a new girlfriend.

596
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,750
[Unknown caller]

597
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,780
Why don't you answer it?

598
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:01,350
It's an unknown caller.
Who knows who this is?

599
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,070
Answer it.

600
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,180
Hello?

601
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:10,870
Yes, I am.

602
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,500
How can I help you?

603
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:30,780
Now?

604
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:36,700
Alright.

605
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:49,390
What is it?

606
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,590
An Ruiyun wants to see me.

607
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,070
What happened?

608
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,190
Still want a girlfriend?

609
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,300
Yes.

610
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,780
I can tell you everything

611
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,190
you want to know.

612
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,220
You don't have to see her.

613
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,430
Tan Shen, please understand.

614
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,980
An Ruiyun wants to see me,

615
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,150
not the other way around.

616
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:55,500
Okay.

617
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:57,460
Consider this a chance

618
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:58,910
to know me better

619
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,020
through someone else.

620
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,300
I must apologize

621
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,430
for my daughter's behavior.

622
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,390
She is too young to understand this.

623
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,260
She can be a little rebellious.

624
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,670
She thinks in extremes sometimes.

625
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,740
I hope you don't mind.

626
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:51,740
It's alright.

627
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,940
You must be curious

628
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,150
as to why I wanted to meet you.

629
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,460
I think matters concerning a relationship

630
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,020
should be discussed

631
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,300
between the two

632
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,220
instead of involving

633
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:11,940
the others.

634
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,460
You misunderstood.

635
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,780
As Tan Shen's former client,

636
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,870
I only want to talk about

637
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,390
the case.

638
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,500
I hope it helps.

639
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:30,780
We'll start with

640
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,260
how I contacted a lawyer

641
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,190
to get a divorce.

642
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,460
My demand was

643
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,430
I get custody of the child

644
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,350
and my ex-husband, Zhu Xiaolei,
must give up everything for the divorce,

645
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,630
including his reputation.

646
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,430
It sounds crazy, doesn't it?

647
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:57,940
No lawyer

648
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,940
would accept this case,

649
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,390
except for Tan Shen.

650
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:02,670
To prove

651
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,460
Zhu Xiaolei was in the wrong,

652
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,460
Tan Shen gave me a lot of ideas.

653
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,780
With Tan Shen's help,

654
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,500
I acquired the legal evidence

655
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,430
to prove Zhu Xiaolei's affair.

656
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,220
But unfortunately,

657
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,020
he knew

658
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:24,210
I'd demand custody of my daughter.

659
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:26,740
So the negotiation

660
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,500
didn't go well.

661
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,460
During those days,

662
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,590
Tan Shen was of great help to me.

663
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,070
I began to rely on him even more.

664
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,070
I relied on him.

665
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,540
Don't get the wrong idea.

666
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,110
Back then,

667
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,150
I was in a tough situation.

668
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,110
Everyone around me thought

669
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,390
I was unreasonable.

670
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,300
For me,

671
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,390
Tan Shen

672
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:19,350
was my lifesaver.

673
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,590
Was posting the evidence of the affair

674
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,940
Tan Shen's idea?

675
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,420
