00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:53,960
Have a nice day.

173
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,080
Okay.

174
00:14:59,280 --> 00:14:59,710
Alright.

175
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:00,880
We'll see how it goes.

176
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:05,710
What's the matter?

177
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,910
We agreed that I can take out a loan.

178
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,910
Now they changed their mind.

179
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,470
I have to make the full payment

180
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,670
and they're rushing us with the payment.

181
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,030
Sir.

182
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:18,520
Good day.

183
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,150
How can I help you?

184
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,230
Is there a new model?

185
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,080
This is our latest model.

186
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,640
And this too.

187
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,710
This is our flagship model.

188
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,960
It's our top-selling model.

189
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:27,790
I'll have a look.

190
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,550
Have a look.

191
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,320
Ma.

192
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,230
Do you have any cash?

193
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,790
Lend me some.

194
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,440
I work for you.

195
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,030
How could you borrow money from me?

196
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,670
I'm sorry.

197
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,470
It's okay.

198
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,200
This phone model is good too.

199
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,000
You can check it out.

200
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,230
Well, look at the damage

201
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,760
that Anhe's shares have done.

202
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,880
Our net asset value

203
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,320
is experiencing a drastic decline.

204
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,760
Clients are asking for redemption.

205
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,400
What can I do?

206
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,640
Even if I were to persuade them,

207
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,910
they would not listen to me.

208
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,180
It's more than

209
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,370
just the redemption issue.

210
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,250
The net worth of a few of our products

211
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,570
has dropped to liquidation price.

212
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,460
If we don't take drastic measures,

213
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,050
the floating loss will be realized.

214
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,460
If this goes big,

215
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,810
our company's image aside,

216
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,100
when the China Securities Regulatory
Commission issues a warning letter,

217
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,490
the damage caused to the company

218
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,300
will be irreparable.

219
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,900
Stop complaining

220
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,220
and find a solution.

221
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:46,300
Our immediate concern

222
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,490
is to solve the liquidity.

223
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,610
We must stabilize our clients' confidence.

224
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,130
Otherwise, if China Securities Regulatory
Commission takes a denunciation

225
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,610
and orders us
to take measures and correct the situation,

226
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,900
that would be brutal.

227
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:57,860
What about

228
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,900
using the company fund

229
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,460
to subscribe to our own products temporarily?

230
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:03,300
It's just temporary. We need market liquidity.

231
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,730
That's not doable.

232
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:06,730
Without the consent from the board of directors,

233
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,780
no one is allowed to use

234
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,780
the company fund.

235
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,020
We'll be doomed then.

236
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,610
Are you nuts?

237
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,730
Stop it.

238
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,250
Is this the time to have a squabble?

239
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,780
Let's think of a solution.

240
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,490
How should we explain this

241
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,210
to Mr. Fang?

242
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:25,700
Who will do the reporting?

243
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,020
Mr. Shen.

244
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,660
I'm working in the administration department,

245
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,370
it's inappropriate for me to do the reporting.

246
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,300
Mr. Qiu.

247
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:57,780
I have something to do later.

248
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,610
Well, I shall...

249
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:08,730
Liu.

250
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,130
Mr. Qiu.

251
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:17,780
Fine.

252
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,610
All of you refuse to go, don't you?

253
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,970
I shall go myself.

254
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,940
Please go with me, Mr. Shen.

255
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,780
If the chairman

256
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,900
gets furious

257
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,850
or upset...

258
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,940
Alright, I'll go.

259
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,250
Due to Anhe's shares,

260
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,540
our company's liquidity

261
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,700
is experiencing a major issue.

262
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,730
The redemption pressure is massive.

263
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,610
According to the statistics

264
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,090
from all sources...

265
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,970
the redemption amount

266
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,060
that the clients submitted

267
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,130
takes up more than 20 percent

268
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,020
of our equity quota.

269
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,540
And the numbers are still increasing rapidly.

270
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,970
Some products

271
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,330
are facing the risk of liquidation price.

272
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,450
Please calm down, sir.

273
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,490
All departments

274
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,580
are trying to find a solution

275
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,250
to solve the issue.

276
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:49,300
That's right.

277
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,130
Someone suggested

278
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,820
using our company fund

279
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,540
to maintain the liquidity

280
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,210
to cope with the redemption.

281
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,540
I see.

282
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:04,660
Well.

283
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,130
Clear some of

284
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,210
the open interest shares

285
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,330
to deal with the redemption pressure.

286
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,210
We must not breach the contract.

287
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,580
We must ensure our clients' benefits

288
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,490
and our company's

289
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:20,540
credibility.

290
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,370
Our clients buy our products

291
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,940
as they trust and support us.

292
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,090
We mustn't fail them.

293
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,660
If there's a need

294
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,900
to use our company fund,

295
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,730
I'll handle that.

296
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,490
Okay?

297
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,330
That's all for now.

298
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:41,970
Noted, sir.

299
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:44,780
Let's go.

300
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:15,850
Is that all?

301
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,850
Was I not clear enough?

302
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,370
Or did Mr. Fang not hear me clearly?

303
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,090
This is such a major issue.

304
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:24,780
Why do I think

305
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,060
that Mr. Fang doesn't really care about it?

306
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:32,360
I'm not sure about the business.

307
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:33,970
However,

308
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,610
our chairman looks at the big picture.

309
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,540
We can't possibly understand him, can we?

310
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:38,900
Am I right?

311
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,020
Hello.

312
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,020
He hasn't come out yet.

313
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,360
It's pointless getting nervous here.

314
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,730
Even if we get

315
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,900
to use the company fund

316
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,210
to fill up the hole

317
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,210
and elevate the share price,

318
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,130
we'd need to wait till the resumption.

319
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:44,730
I know.

320
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,250
Okay.

321
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,610
Are you in Nanzhou?

322
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,700
Are you free for a meeting?

323
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,090
Okay.

324
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,020
I'll wait for your call.

325
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:16,780
I'll refill the water.

326
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:27,780
Greetings, Mr. Qiu.

327
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,420
That girl named Su Wen

328
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,780
looks familiar.

329
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:00,900
Is she related

330
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,540
to Xu Youning?

331
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,580
I think

332
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,330
she went to the same high school
as Xu Youning's wife.

333
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,970
The same high school?

334
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,060
Are they close?

335
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,330
I think they're good friends.

336
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:14,970
She was there

337
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,090
throughout the funeral.

338
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,370
Listen.

339
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,250
Keep an eye

340
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,700
on Su Wen for these few days.

341
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,450
Report to me at once

342
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,300
if the inspection team is
