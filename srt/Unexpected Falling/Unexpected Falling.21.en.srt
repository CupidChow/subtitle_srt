00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,980
[Episode 21]

3
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,310
Don't mention Ruan Zhenzhen to Liu.

4
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:48,760
When did I ever tell him

5
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,800
about Ruan Zhenzhen?

6
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,910
Just a kind reminder.

7
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,630
Liu isn't an outsider.

8
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,590
Just don't tell him.

9
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,950
But I don't know how to use it.

10
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,720
Su Wen seems

11
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,360
to have a close relationship

12
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,080
with Ruan Zhenzhen.

13
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,670
So I asked around.

14
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,270
She is a strong career woman.

15
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,720
You could say
she's Xu Weidong's capable assistant.

16
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,080
She also has a say

17
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,320
in the inspection team.

18
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,440
If she has any ill intentions,

19
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,110
it'll be impossible for us

20
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,550
to guard against her.

21
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,670
Mr. Qiu,

22
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,160
we can't just think about putting up our guard.

23
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,440
If this continues,

24
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,670
we'll end up resigning ourselves
to the situation.

25
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,880
We must be proactive

26
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,830
in our actions.

27
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,880
Do you mean

28
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,440
we should look into Su Wen

29
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,830
and see what she has

30
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,720
on us?

31
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,600
I meant

32
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,720
the best defense

33
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,800
is a good offense.

34
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,320
Do you agree?

35
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,270
Since we're worried

36
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,360
she'll find out anything,

37
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,720
we shouldn't give her

38
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,240
the chance to carry on
with the inspection anymore.

39
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,470
Su Wen,

40
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,670
it's such a huge workload.

41
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Can you handle it all?

42
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,600
Yes, I can.

43
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,110
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Songrong.

44
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,600
It's something I took for my friend,

45
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,550
which has nothing to do with work.

46
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,110
I thought

47
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,640
it was new information for the inspection.

48
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,600
Ms. Wen, here's your coffee

49
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,270
without sugar.

50
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,070
Mr. Wu.

51
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,350
Thank you.

52
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,830
Which one do you want?

53
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,390
I brought two cups.

54
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,040
It's okay.

55
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,670
I can drink tea.

56
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,670
I'll go and add more water.

57
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,790
I'll enjoy this myself, then.

58
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,390
Okay.

59
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,640
Don't you know

60
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,510
it's perfectly justified to pay your debts?

61
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,070
I really don't have money.

62
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,390
I don't have any.

63
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,390
Pay up!

64
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,070
Your suits look pretty decent.

65
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,320
Where's the money?

66
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,440
-Are you messing with me?
-Guys,

67
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,040
I really don't have money.

68
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,270
If you don't pay today,

69
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,440
I'll kill you!

70
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,230
Can you give me two more days?

71
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,920
Two days.

72
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,510
How many days did I postpone it for you?

73
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:11,760
How many days?

74
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,720
How many days, huh?

75
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,230
Gang,

76
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,760
why aren't you beating him up?

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,440
Beat him!

78
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,200
Beat him!

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,880
Do it!

80
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,480
Hit him!

81
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,110
Beat him up!

82
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,000
Run, Piku!

83
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:52,950
Go! Go!

84
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,070
Beat him!

85
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,230
The soup is ready.

What's wrong with You Gang?

94
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,950
He caused such a big problem.

95
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,480
Instead of mending his ways

96
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,350
and starting over,

97
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,350
he doesn't even show up.

98
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,200
How are you going to live with him like this?

99
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,230
Does he still want this family?

100
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,230
Just divorce him.

101
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,070
You won't be able to live

102
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,550
a decent life with him.

103
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:58,830
Let's eat.

104
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,830
I'll get you some rice.

105
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,900

[Haozailai Seafood and Fujian Cuisine]

108
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,280
Zhenzhen.

109
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,790
I thought you'd send the stuff

110
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,910
to the restaurant.

111
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,350
What did you recall?

112
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,640
You're asking for the bank statement
out of a sudden.

113
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,590
Su Wen asked for it.

114
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,910
I'm sorry for troubling you

115
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,200
to send it over.

116
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,520
Not at all.

117
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,230
Let's talk inside.

118
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,790
We can just talk out here.

119
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,200
I need to ask you something.

120
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,470
I don't think we should talk out here.

121
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,550
The police said

122
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,710
the key pouch

123
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,230
was found in Lu Yang's car?

124
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,520
What else did the police ask you?

125
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,200
They didn't really ask much.

126
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:19,840
They asked

127
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,200
why I suddenly

128
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,080
want to look for the key pouch.

129
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,000
I told them my house was broken into.

130
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,840
But don't worry.

131
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,640
I didn't mention your name.

132
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,440
Have they caught the culprit

133
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,400
who attacked Lu Yang?

134
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,640
I did ask.

135
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,880
But the police refused to tell me anything

136
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,790
because it's still under investigation.

137
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,400
By the way,

138
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,670
when are you going back to Beiling?

139
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,470
Su Wen wants to buy you a meal.

140
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,470
I won't be going back for now.

141
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,840
I've decided

142
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,790
to stay and help you.

143
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:33,960
You don't have to.

144
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,760
It's getting late.

145
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,880
You should go back.

146
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,640
When you come back next time,

147
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,910
bring Yan and Su Wen with you.

148
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,960
Let's have a meal together.

149
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,960
I won't see you out.

150
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,440
I just want to help you.

151
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,840
But I can't accept

152
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,960
your help.

153
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,150
How so?

154
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,520
Because I can't repay

155
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,550
the same favor to you.

156
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,080
I don't need you to repay me.

157
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,670
No one will give

158
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,880
without expecting something in return.

159
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,880
They may not say it. But their hearts want it.

160
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,000
They may not want it now.
But they'll want it in the future.

161
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,080
You were right yesterday.

162
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,520
If this goes on,

163
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,080
it won't be good

164
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,670
for any of us.

165
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,400
Let's end it here.

166
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,030
Yesterday, I said I wanted to leave

167
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,280
because

168
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,670
I didn't know how to face you.

169
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,470
Because that night,

170
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,760
in any case,

171
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,550
I went too far.

172
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,280

00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,140
Thank you so much.

344
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,500
Don't move!

345
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,500
Hey, mate. Don't hit me.

346
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,380
No, please.

347
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,070
Mister.

348
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:56,740
No, stop.

349
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:58,430
Mister.

350
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,380
I took care of him.

351
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,070
Mister, we can talk this out.

352
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:23,830
I'll tell you

353
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,590
everything I know.

354
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,220
Do you know Xia Xinliang?

355
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,140
Yes.

356
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:32,950
Where is he?

357
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:34,670
I don't know.

358
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:39,220
I...

359
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:39,740
Wait.

360
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,220
Mister.

361
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,340
I really don't know, mister.

362
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,380
I don't know, mister.

363
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,140
I really don't know.

364
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,030
I don't know where he is.

365
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,340
How does he keep in touch with you?

366
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,430
He doesn't contact me.

367
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,190
If he doesn't contact you,

368
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,500
how do you contact him if anything happens?

369
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,220
I can't find him now.

370
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:58,620
A while back,

371
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,070
a woman came looking for him.

372
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,500
I gave him a call.

373
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,100
But he scolded me.

374
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,310
Since then,

375
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,670
I couldn't get a hold of him anymore.

376
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,500
Since you can't find him anymore,

377
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:13,620
why are you

378
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,310
still working here?

379
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,500
He pays me a salary.

380
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,030
I don't have to pay utilities

381
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,460
while staying here.

382
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,340
What else did he do

383
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,790
with your ID?

384
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:37,950
Apart from using your ID card

385
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:38,550
to buy a car

386
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,670
and register for a mobile number,

387
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,860
did he use it

388
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,550
for anything else?

389
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,860
I... I don't know.

390
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:43,620
I...

391
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,790
I have two ID cards.

392
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,590
One is with me.

393
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,500
The other one is with him.

394
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:47,980
I really don't know

395
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,670
what he did

396
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:49,860
with my ID card.

397
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,460
Did Liu leave just like that?

398
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,950
He was busy, so he left in a hurry.

399
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,460
Liu sure is a loyal friend.

400
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,550
He came here purely

401
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,220
to help us out.

402
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,710
We didn't have time to have a drink with him.

403
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,670
There are always opportunities
to meet up next time.

404
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:52,620
What are you looking at?

405
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,430
Look at that pagoda.

406
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,460
It looks beautiful.

407
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,030
It sure does.

408
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,380
What do you think

409
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,950
Xia Xinliang is hiding?

410
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:15,790
Why is he

411
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,620
so well hidden?

412
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:20,710
I don't know.

413
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,910
It's certainly

414
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,310
not as simple as borrowing

415
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,190
Xu Youning's account.

416
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:42,740
Let's have some mutton.

417
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:43,950
Sure.

418
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:00,620
Ruan,

419
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,070
please take a seat.

420
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,340
Here, sit down.

421
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:12,670
Thank you.

422
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,620
The money

423
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,950
should have been transferred.

424
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,380
But the company is undergoing an audit

425
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,430
at this moment.

426
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,140
So we can't make any transactions.

427
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,790
That's why it has been delayed until now.

428
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:27,590
I just

429
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,910
found out about this matter.

430
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,100
In any case, we didn't do a good job

431
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,980
on our part.

432
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,070
No matter what,

433
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,340
we shouldn't have delayed the transaction.

434
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,260
After you go back,

435
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,220
talk to Youning's parents

436
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,140
to find a time

437
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,790
to come over to complete the paperwork.

438
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,590
We'll transfer the money

439
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,670
as soon as possible.

440
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:50,670
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

441
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,140
It's been a while

442
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,260
since Youning passed away.

443
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,100
When someone passes,

444
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,620
we must let it go and move on.

445
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,030
We mustn't think in extremes.

446
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,140
Right?

447
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,460
Ruan,

448
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,100
there's one thing

449
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,860
I want to tell you.

450
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,500
When it comes to Youning's belongings,

451
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,500
we must take good care of them.

452
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,380
We can't show them to others casually.

453
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,100
It's been a while

454
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,420
since you worked, right?

455
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,750
You may not be aware

456
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,300
of the reality in society now.

457
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,350
Some people

458
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,830
can sell out

459
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,260
their family and friends

460
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,350
for their own benefit.

461
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,590
Maybe you treat her

462
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,070
as a good friend

463
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,380
from the bottom of your heart.

464
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,470
But she sees you

465
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,300
as a stepping stone.

466
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:04,950
She even tried

467
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,230
to dig into your past.

468
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,350
Mr. Fang,

469
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,180
I don't understand what you're trying to say.

470
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:15,990
Please be more straightforward.

471
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,540
I'll be frank, then.

472
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:25,950
The inspection team

473
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,470
has been investigating Youning's matter.

474
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:32,900
At first,

475
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,750
we should separate work

476
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,470
and private matters.

477
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,950
They're not related in any way.

478
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:38,870
Don't you agree?

479
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:39,710
You can't mix these two matters.

480
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,300
I'm worried that some people

481
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,780
might use their connections

482
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,070
to spread rumors

483
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,900
for their gain.

484
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:53,870
Ruan,

485
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,020
this matter doesn't affect the company

486
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,750
that much.

487
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:00,750
I'm just afraid

488
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,070
that Youning will be blamed

489
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,590
and it may even affect you.

490
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:12,670
Come in.

491
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:22,390
Mr. Fang,

492
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:23,940
those from Anhe Travel are here.

493
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:25,630
Okay.

494
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,630
Mr. Fang, you should get to work, then.

495
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:29,740
I'll take my leave, then.

496
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:32,980
Ruan,

497
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,430
let us know if you need help.

498
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,940
We'll definitely lend you a hand.

499
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,260
Qiu,

500
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,540
please help me see her out.

501
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:47,630
Yes, sir.

502
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,070
Hi, Mrs. Xu.

503
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:23,830
Zhenzhen.

504
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:24,700
Yan.

505
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,390
Mrs. Xu, it's been a long time.

506
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:43,870
Mr. Mao.

507
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,020
Yan.

508
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,390
You must be Miss Shen.

509
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:49,830
Yes.

510
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:50,430
Nice to meet you.

511
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,300
Nice to meet you.

512
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,460
Mr. Mao, this way, please.

513
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,390
Okay, let's go.

514
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:33,000
[Yu's Chongqing Noodles]

515
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,070
Come on,

516
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,740
why did you pick such a remote restaurant?

517
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:42,940
I almost got lost.

518
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,300
Do you have the bank statement?

519
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,070
Hello, please enjoy.

520
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:51,630
Thank you.

521
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,070
I haven't gotten it.

522
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:03,940
Didn't Gao Jun tell you

523
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,220
to get it from him at the hotel?

524
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:05,940
Didn't you go?

525
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,350
He was busy last night.

526
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,020
So I couldn't get it.

527
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,940
I'll get it from him some other day.

528
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,500
Then why did you come here today?

529
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,430
Did you come to ask me out for lunch?

530
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,350
Jinshang wanted to see me

531
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:20,070
and talk about Xu Youning's death compensation.

532
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,260
So I drop by to visit you since I'm here.

533
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,110
Am I delaying your work

534
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,020
by asking you out now?

535
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,390
It's okay.

536
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,300
No matter how busy I am,

537
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,910
I still need to eat.

538
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,390
What do you want to eat?

539
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,870
They say their noodles are good.

540
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,020
Okay, we'll have noodles.

541
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,390
How did you know

542
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,430
about this place?

543
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,150
The first few years Xu Youning started working,

544
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:45,540
I always came to have lunch with him.

545
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,350
We've dined at all the restaurants around here.

546
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,220
One day, I just found this place.

547
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:51,940
I didn't expect it to be still running

548
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:54,780
after so many years.

549
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,910
What are you doing?

550
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,870
I've taught you so many times.

551
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:06,830
Why are you still clueless?

552
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,870
See this?

553
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,020
Just scan this code.

554
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,940
It'll appear here.

555
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,260
After that, you can order from here.

556
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,460
After you finish ordering,

557
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,740
you can pay right away.

558
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,460
You don't have to call the waitress at all.

559
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,740
You're so silly.

560
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:22,110
That can't be helped.

561
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,350
Xu Youning

562
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,070
had controlled you so strictly.

563
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:26,350
You see,

564
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,500
he'd be happy

565
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,350
to confine you inside the house.

566
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:29,870
I've told you before.

567
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:30,780
But you got upset.

568
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,110
The more I said it,

569
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,590
the more it felt like I was trying

570
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,780
to ruin your marriage.

571
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,830
If he did treat you well,

572
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:37,590
he shouldn't have

573
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:39,020
kept you at home

574
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,020
like a pet

575
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,150
just to make himself happy.

576
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,020
I'll stop talking.

577
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:56,830
He's already dead.

578
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:58,110
There's no point talking about it anymore.

579
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,300
What do you want to drink?

580
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,670
Soup noodles.

581
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,430
I don't want any drinks. You can order yours.

582
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,300
The noodles are really good.

583
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,590
I remember you said

584
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,150
you printed out

585
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,780
Xu Youning's mobile phone call history.

586
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,390
Remember to make a copy for me.

587
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:39,590
Su Wen.

588
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,630
Did the inspection team find out

589
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,540
what happened with Xu Youning?

590
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,150
Other than front running,

591
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,460
what other crimes did he commit?

592
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:01,940
Insider trading?

593
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:06,830
Tunneling?

594
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:10,500
Zhenzhen,

595
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:11,700
I have...

596
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,940
Work ethics, right?

597
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,150
Because of your work ethics,

598
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,070
you can't tell me

599
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,220
what you've found.

600
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:29,630
But

601
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,870
you can obtain

602
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,220
case files, the notebook,

603
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,220
and bank statement from me.

604
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:41,980
You take all the information

605
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:42,940
from me

606
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:45,150
for your inspection.

607
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,150
Is that so?

608
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,190
Ruan Zhenzhen,

609
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,110
do you know what you're saying?

610
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,700
Who's instigating you?

611
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,260
Have you become a fool

612
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:06,980
after being kept at home

613
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,910
by Xu Youning?

614
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,670
Don't you use your brain?

615
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,350
Are you going to believe

616
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:12,940
whatever people tell you?

617
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:23,390
Zhenzhen.

618
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,110
You've never joined the workforce.

619
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:27,540
You don't know

620
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,630
how treacherous and complicated it is.

621
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,260
No one

622
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,250
will gossip with you for no reason.

623
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,020
Anything they say casually

624
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,300
has a purpose.

625
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,740
I know I've never joined the workforce.

626
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,020
I'm nothing but a housewife

627
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:38,940
with no future.

628
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,630
I'm just a pet

629
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:41,500
Xu Youning kept at home.

630
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,540
I stay home

631
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,630
until my brain has become dull.

632
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,830
I'm not smart, and I'm hopeless.

633
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,260
I'm just useless.

634
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,020
Isn't this what you're trying to say?
