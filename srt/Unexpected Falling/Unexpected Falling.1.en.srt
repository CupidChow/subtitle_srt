Did you try restoring the memory card?

649

His SIM card

650
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,460
should still be in there, right?

651
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,660
You didn't find anything useful from it either?

652

Nothing.

No records to speak of.

654

Then, aside from the tens of millions of debt,

What kind of supplement

679
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,580
are you taking?

680
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,180
Can you introduce it to me?

681
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,980
I'd like to learn how to stay healthy from you.

682
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,860
You don't need it since you're young.

683
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:08,580
Ms. Wen.

684

When Wang leaves,

685
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,700
the chief auditor position

frequenting the directors' offices lately.

689
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,820
He's really putting in the effort.

690
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,620
I bet he's up to something.

691
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,660
Less gossiping, more working.

692
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,460
Get prepared.

693
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,460
You're going on a business trip with me.

694
