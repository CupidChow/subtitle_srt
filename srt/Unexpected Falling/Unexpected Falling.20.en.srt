[Unexpected Falling]

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,980
[Episode 20]

3
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,160
Unlock the door.

4
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,480
You drive.

5
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,400
The door is already unlocked.

6
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,910
This stalemate

7
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,190
can't go on forever.

8
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,270
Either way,

9
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,960
Mr. Mao has been working in Anhe

10
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,270
for a decade.

11
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,080
He has some influence there one way or another.

12
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:38,910
Although you

13
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,800
caught him with his pants down,

14
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,520
he won't admit defeat

15
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,390
just like that.

16
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,670
I heard

17
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,880
they plan to join forces

18
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,520
with Nanzhou Municipal Investment Group

19
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,720
for a strategic investment.

20
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,910
If this is happening,

21
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,670
then it's no longer a feud

22
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,440
between Jinshang and Anhe.

23
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,110
Besides,

24
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,080
if a state-owned company is involved,

25
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,470
the regulatory commission

26
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,320
might take sides.

27
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,110
I don't want

28
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,110
to be in this situation either.

29
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,600
You know very well

30
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,830
that when Jinshang acquired Anhe,

31
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:23,910
it was because of

32
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,670
the industry's promising prospects.

33
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,360
But Anhe's stock price

34
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,960
has been plummeting.

35
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,800
And that made Jinshang lose a lot of money

36
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,320
and the clients almost flocked to liquidate.

37
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,440
It's impossible for me to weasel out now.

38
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,670
It can't be helped.

39
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,550
It can't be helped?

40
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,600
You are unrelenting.

41
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,670
I heard

42
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,390
that Mr. Qiu

43
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,960
claimed an emergency and held

44
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,320
a board meeting

45
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,520
to revoke Mao Shunheng's title

46
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,160
as the general manager.

47
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,270
Don't buy into their nonsense.

48
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,800
It's just an administrative procedure.

49
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,670
Mao Shunheng

50
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,440
still has

51
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,390
the company's stamp.

52
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,160
We can't possibly barge in

53
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,670
and snatch the stamp away, can we?

54
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,880
Of course

55
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,160
not.

56
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,070
It'll be embarrassing.

57
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,390
Jianshe.

58
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,070
Joking aside,

59
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,550
I still want to remind you

60
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,670
that Jinshang has

61
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,070
more than ten products

62
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,230
pending approval.

63
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,230
Don't burn

64
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,720
all your bridges.

65
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,830
God knows which bridge

66
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,670
can lead you to Rome.

67
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,070
Don't you agree?

68
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:43,550
Nanqiu.

69
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,200
Did you find

70
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,230
your ladder of success?

71
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,670
Why are you concerned about this

72
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,550
out of a sudden?

73
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,550
What do you mean?

74
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,720
I have nothing but your interest

75
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,670
at heart.

76
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,000
Are you implying that I'm a traitor?

77
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,720
Fine.

78
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,230
I'll leave.

79
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,950
I was just joking.

80
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,270
Don't be mad.

81
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,550
Sit.

82
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,880
Your temper hasn't changed at all.

83
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,830
What did they

84
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,070
ask you to tell me?

85
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,760
What else?

86
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,320
Maintain a harmonious

87
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,070
and friendly

88
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,950
partnership, of course.

89
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,070
There is so much money

90
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,440
to earn.

91
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,600
Why do you have to

92
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,760
fight with each other?

93
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,070
Be frank with me now.

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,040
Do you own

95
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,550
many Anhe stocks?

96
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,070
Yes.

97
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,880
A lot of them.

98
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,110
Why else do I care this much then?

99
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,760
The powerful ones fight each other,

100
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,070
but the commoners are the victims.

101
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,440
You see

102
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,040
how hard I worked

103
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,230
to earn money.

104
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,320
And now,

105
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,440
all my hard earn money is at stake.

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,390
It's okay.

107
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,390
I'll help you.

108
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,480
Just don't be like him.

109
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:30,950
Who?

110
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,070
Xu Youning.

111
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,600
Jianshe.

112
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,320
Do you really want to see me end up like him?

113
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,350
If that happens to me,

114
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,670
won't you feel sad?

115
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,230
Here. Drink.

116
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,720
Zhenzhen.

117
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,320
Don't bring up my job again.

118
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,550
I know my health very well.

119
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,070
I need to learn how to be independent.

120
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,600
I can't rely

121
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,720
on my friends forever.

122
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,480
Don't worry.

123
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,510
I won't wash dishes for all my life.

124
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,350
The lawsuit

125
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,550
is taking a toll on me.

126
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,550
Once everything is settled,

127
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:44,760
I'll think hard

128
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,920
about my career path.

129
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,670
Ruan Zhenzhen.

130
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,390
You're so long-winded.

131
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
Just let me say one sentence.

132
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,760
Go ahead.

133
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,510
You'd better

134
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,320
call Su Wen back.

135
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,200
Miss Su.

136
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Your red velvet cake

137
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,880
is ready.

138
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,200
Thank you.

139
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:21,840
You're welcome.

140
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,840
Bye.

141
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,670
Impressive.

142
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,590
From three to six.

143
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,520
A long chat with Attorney Gao?

144
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,320
I knew you are a good friend.

145
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,030
I haven't had

146
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,080
their cake in ages.

147
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,150
Don't pull this trick on me.

148
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,880
Tell me now.

149
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:01,960
What did you do this afternoon?

150
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,280
We were discussing the case.

151
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,790
You sound guilty.

152
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,280
I didn't imply that there was something else
between you two.

153
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,320
We were truly

154
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,470
talking about the case.

155
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,230
If you don't trust me,

156
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,840
I'll call him now.

157
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,320
I'll ask him to explain it to you.

158
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,640
I just said goodbye to him.

159
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,080
I don't think I should call him that soon.

160
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,280
You don't think so?

161
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,350
Yes.

162
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,150
I agree you shouldn't

163
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,110
call him this soon too.

164
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,840
So, let me call him.

165
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,840
Fine. Fine.

166
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,910
Sorry.

167
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,350
Jesus.

168
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,590
Come clean now.

169
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,840
What were you doing this afternoon?

170
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,960
So mysterious.

171
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,320
I didn't lie.

172
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,200
I was

173
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,150
with Gao Jun.

174
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,030
We went to meet Xia Xinliang.

175
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,640
Xia Xinliang?

176
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,030
Did you manage to?

177
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,470
How?

178
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,670
We did find him,

179
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
and we got something out of him.

180
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,080
These are

181
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,710
Xia Xinliang's phone number

182
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,470
and number plate?

183
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,230
They do indicate so,

184
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,790
but something feels off to me.

185
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,550
[Hai C2X829, 19813118803]

186
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,790
Okay.

187
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,230
I'll have a look now.

188
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,790
So you're

189
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,790
not quitting?

190
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,150
My presence here

191
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,280
has nothing to do with your company.

192
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,550
I stay

193
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,710
because I want to do something for Ruan Zhenzhen.

194
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,080
It is of my own volition.

195
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,470
Whatever we find, you cannot

196
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,840
reveal it to the company.

197
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,150
Are you serious?

198
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,030
We can investigate this.

199
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,520
It's like moonlighting.

200
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,350
They don't overlap.

201
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,590
But with my company,

202
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,000
we'll have the technology.

203
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,280
You have many options

204
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,350
and it's convenient.

205
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,000
I won't stop you if you want to leave.

206
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,760
But if you stay,

207
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,590
I can offer you

208
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,590
higher pay

209
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,200
than your company does.

210
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,000
We have been friends for many years.

211
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,710
I can't possibly

212
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,710
leave you alone here.

213
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:25,910
What about Wu then?

214
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,640
Wu?

215
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,000
She can go back.

216
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,710
Both of us will stay.

217
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:33,960
Okay.

218
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,880
As you wish.

219
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,200
Xia Xinliang's account

220
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,280
was handled by Qiu Zhijian.

221
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,230
That's weird.

222
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,110
Gao Jun said that too.

223
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,670
Ruan Zhenzhen.

224
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,790
You might as well

225
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,790
lick the plate.

226
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,790
Sure.

227
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,200
You're disgusting.

228
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,400
Zhenzhen.

229
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,640
Xu Youning might have taken out the loan

230
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,960
for front-running.

231
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,550
Front-running?

232
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,200
Yes.

233
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,470
And it's possible

234
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,520
that the operation

235
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,350
has failed.

236
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,350
All the money is gone.

237
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,550
So Xu Youning

238
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,640
took his life?

239
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,590
Who told you Xu Youning took his life?

240
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,640
I found antidiabetic medications at home.

241
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,710
The doctor said if a normal person took it,

242
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,350
it would induce a shock.

243
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,520
And that explains the car accident.

244
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,520
There was no sign of braking

245
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,110
at the scene.

246
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:04,910
Obviously, he lost consciousness

247
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,550
when he was driving.

248
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,840
You mean

249
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,030
Xu Youning fabricated

250
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,080
the entire car accident?

251
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
But that's odd.

252
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,400
Jinshang Capital is a tall building.

253
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,550
Why didn't he jump from the roof?

254
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,200
That is usually how people in his line of work die.

255
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,030
Xu Youning was a prideful man.

256
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,400
He wouldn't want people to know

257
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,200
he took his life.

258
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,000
After the lawsuit,

259
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,550
come with me to Guangzhou.

260
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,760
To Guangzhou?

261
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,910
Why?

262
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,880
I won't beat around the bush.

263
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,400
Now.

264
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,520
Come clean.

265
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,470
What is going on between you

266
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,550
and Gao Jun?

267
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,280
A busy attorney

268
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,640
like him

269
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,150
took time out

270
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,230
to find Xia Xinliang with you?

271
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,200
You two sure are exceptionally close.

272
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,280
Two days ago,

273
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,150
Gao Jun

274
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,790
kissed me forcefully.

275
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,550
He kissed you forcefully?

276
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,400
And then?

277
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,230
Then?

278
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,550
What else could happen?

279
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,030
He kissed you forcefully

280
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,230
and how did you react?

281
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,230
I slapped him.

282
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,590
My goodness.

283
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,030
A few days of not seeing you

284
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,760
and you guys are already

285
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,880
at this stage.

286
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,030
He kissed you.

287
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,030
You slapped him.

288
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,440
And this afternoon, you two

289
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,790
searched for Xia Xinliang this afternoon.

290
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,000
You two are interesting.

291
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,670
Gao Jun

292
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,470
is a complicated person.

293
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,910
I don't get him at all.

294
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,670
No offense,

295
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,440
but Ruan Zhenzhen,

296
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,880
with that mind of yours,

297
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,280
you won't ever get anyone.

298
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,660
If he truly likes you,

299
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:25,810
then he's quite a hopeless romantic.

300
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,220
Why can't I find

301
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,610
a loyal man like him?

302
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,900
Yan

303
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,420
broke up with me, and shortly after,

304
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,370
he found himself another girlfriend.

305
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:36,690
Don't pretend

306
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,300
you're a hopeless romantic.

307
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,300
Life is short.

308
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:42,810
I shouldn't waste time on men

309
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,050
who are not worth it.

310
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,170
What do you feel then?

311
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,370
Feel what?

312
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,220
Don't play dumb.

313
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,930
Gao Jun ticks all the boxes

314
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,220
for an eligible bachelor.

315
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,930
Don't tell me you won't remarry

316
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,370
because of Xu Youning

317
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,210
or you don't deserve

318
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,060
Gao Jun.

319
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,370
I will take no cliché from you.

320
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,540
We're both normal humans.

321
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,660
Neither is more deserving of another.

322
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,940
That's my girl.

323
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,330
But I'm mired in debt.

324
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,060
I don't want to burden someone else.

325
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,700
But that doesn't mean you can't sleep with him.

326
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,900
As long as you two aren't married,

327
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,180
your debt won't burden him.

328
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,330
From a logical point of view,

329
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,700
Gao Jun

330
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,250
is the best suitor there is.

331
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,180
And a relationship costs nothing.

332
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,540
He's leaving soon.

333
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,490
I found

334
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,370
the phone number.

335
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,450
Guess whose number it is?

336
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,870
[Wang Dali]

337
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:15,970
Wang Dali?

338
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,490
He's the car owner

339
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,580
you ran into

340
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,060
as you exit

341
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:22,820
the Xinliang factory.

342
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,130
What a coincidence.

343
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:39,850
I was careless.

344
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,900
Let's find this Wang Dali.

345
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,450
We need tech support.

346
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:46,450
Should we inform

347
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,210
the company first?

348
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,700
It's okay if you don't want to.

349
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,060
I just believe that with the company's support,

350
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,180
we can use the technology

351
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,060
and have more options.

352
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,130
It'll be convenient.

353
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,580
Don't even think about it.

354
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,060
I

355
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,850
can find a phone number

356
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,490
or pull out an address.

357
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,610
But locating a person

358
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,900
isn't my forte.

359
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,020
To do this,

360
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,090
sometimes, you need to be coercive.

361
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:18,370
Use Liu.

362
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,180
Liu can do it.

363
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,450
He is a veteran.

364
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,450
And he's familiar with the people there.

365
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,250
Liu will speed things up.

366
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,580
It will be a walk in the park.

367
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,060
[Chairman]
Lu Yang is still unconscious.

368
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,330
The doctor said

369
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:46,940
if he couldn't wake up soon,

370
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,780
he'd stay comatose forever.

371
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,130
His parents

372
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:52,780
heard some superstitions

373
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,490
from somewhere.

374
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,370
They said

375
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,780
Xu Youning was murdered

376
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,090
and his spirit refuses to leave.

377
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,060
They want the Xus

378
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,250
to perform a ritual to send Youning's spirit away

379
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,970
so that Lu Yang could wake up.

380
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,370
Nonsense.

381
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:11,610
Exactly.

382
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,450
They are superstitious.

383
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,900
I already talked to them.

384
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,020
As for Lu Yang,

385
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,450
his life is our priority.

386
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,610
If his family has any financial problems,

387
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,370
they can seek help from the company.

388
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,300
We will help them.

389
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,420
That's what I told

390
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,490
his family too.

391
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,300
By the way,

392
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,020
I have run a background check

393
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,730
on the attorney

394
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,970
who's helping Ruan Zhenzhen.

395
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,370
He went to the same high school as Xu Youning.

396
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,090
His name is Gao Jun.

397
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,450
Gao Jun?

398
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,660
Yes, Gao Jun.

399
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:44,490
People say

400
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,780
that he and Ruan Zhenzhen are close.

401
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,580
Five weeks

402
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,300
after Xu Youning passed away
and when his family visited his grave,

403
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,420
he was the reason why

404
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,940
Ruan Zhenzhen had a fallout

405
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,660
with her in-laws.

406
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,330
It was messy.

407
00:20:59,450 --> 00:20:59,970
Qiu.

408
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:01,580
I need you

409
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,610
to handle this yourself.

410
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,060
Find out more about

411
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,330
Gao Jun.

412
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,060
Is he an old acquaintance

413
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,210
of Ruan Zhenzhen

414
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,450
or did they just meet?

415
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:12,060
Noted.

416
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,180

417
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:20,820
(call me.)

418

Thanks, mister.

426
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:36,780
I did ask around.

427
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,060
Wang Dali is from this village,

428
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,250
but he doesn't live here.

429
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:42,900
He works somewhere else.

430
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,660
Guess where.

431
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,450
Xinliang Food Processing Manufacturer.

432
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,580
Do you always have to do this?

433
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,900
You're ruining my moment.

434
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,330
You always get the right answer,

435
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,730
so how am I supposed to deliver
the surprise to you?

436
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:58,900
So,

437
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,580
are we going to meet

438
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,970
this Wang Dali soon?

439
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,210
This factory

440
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,490
only has a guard.

441
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,060
Is Wang Dali the guard?

442
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,130
It should be.

443
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,060
So,

444
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,580
Xia Xinliang

445
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,850
used the ID

446
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,450
of his factory's guard

447
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,130
to buy a phone number and a car.

448
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,330
Xia Xinliang uses

449
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,420
the number

450
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,370
and the car.

451
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,420
Then...

452
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,330
Could the driver who drove past

453
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:31,330
the factory's entrance that night

454
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,660
be Xia Xinliang?

455
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,620
[Nanzhou Xinliang Food Processing Manufacturer]

456
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,670
[Xia Xinliang]

457
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:48,450
They are not the same person.

458
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:51,450
I'm saying

459
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:52,940
the man and the Xia Xinliang

460
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,940
who went to the bank

461
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,850
are not the same person.

462
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,850
Not the same person?

463
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,660
The driver drove

464
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,820
past the factory's entrance

465
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,900
in Wang Dali's car at night.

466
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,850
Who could the driver be

467
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:03,780
if not Xia Xinliang?

468
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,210
You should be proud of yourself now.

469
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,450
Assuming you are right,

470
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:12,540
then the Xia Xinliang you saw

471
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,420
in the bank

472
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,250
was not Xia Xinliang.

473
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:16,940
It's possible.

474
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:18,850
What did I say?

475
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:19,730
If a fake

476
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,450
customer service call from the bank
can lure him out,

477
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,370
then everything is going way too well.

478
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,540
Wait.

479
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,130
Something still can't be explained.

480
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,580
If he knew

481
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,090
it was just a bait,

482
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,730
he could have just ignored it.

483
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,420
Why did he hire someone

484
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,250
to mislead you?

485
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,540
What does he want?

486
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,820
Something else, definitely.

487
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:46,730
This is getting interesting.

488
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:53,730
What is your next move?

489
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,300
If the Xia Xinliang

490
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,020
you met yesterday is a fake one,

491
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,250
should I continue

492
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,180
investigating

493
00:23:59,180 --> 00:23:59,970
his car?

494
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,700
Yes.

495
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,730
We have to.

496
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,540
Eliminate the fake ones

497
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,330
to know who is real.

498
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:14,300
Your wife told me

499
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:14,900
to stop you from smoking.

500
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:44,540
So?

501
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,090
Not bad, isn't it?

502
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,250
You're so good.

503
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:49,330
Just so you know,

504
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,490
with my skill,

505
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,780
even a hairdresser

506
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,180
has to call me

507
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,250
an expert.

508
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,730
Do you know

509
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,700
what your hair looked like just now?

510
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,540
You were like a Sphinx.

511
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,180
Oh, come on.

512
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,130
Look.

513
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,020
You're beautiful.

514
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:13,900
Wait.

515
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,780
Pout.

516
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,370
Come on.

517
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,730
Purse your lips.

518
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:44,250
So?

519
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,780
Now, you look gorgeous.

520
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:50,730
It's for me?

521
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:51,420
Yes.

522
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:52,700
I'll take it then.

523
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,850
I'm broke.

524
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,780
You know,

525
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,450
when you feel down,

526
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,700
you should change your style regularly.

527
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,610
But I don't feel down.

528
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:03,660
You don't?

529
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,020
"He's leaving soon."

530
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,250
What's wrong with you?

531
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,700
"He's leaving soon."

532
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,180
Su Wen.

533
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:12,250
Why?

534
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:13,210
You were like that.

535
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:13,700
Su Wen.

536
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:18,450
He came back.

537
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:20,250
Cut it out.

538
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,370
Let's see who's at the door.

539
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,700
Wait for me in the car.

540
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:30,700
Yes, sir.

541
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,450
Ms. Su, I didn't expect you to be here.

542
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,060
You took leave

543
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:50,850
to pay your friend a visit.

544
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:52,850
Just a short visit.

545
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:53,970
I'll be back in the office this afternoon.

546
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,370
Have some water.

547
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:56,970
Thank you.

548
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:01,450
Mr. Youning

549
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,540
was an important member of the company.

550
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,180
We are deeply sorry

551
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,130
for his passing.

552
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,210
Mr. Fang

553
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,210
cares a lot about you.

554
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,090
He wanted to visit you

555
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,330
in person today,

556
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,020
but unfortunately,

557
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,780
there is a sudden

558
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:20,940
meeting.

559
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,090
I appreciate it.

560
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:32,180
I didn't just come here

561
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:34,450
to visit you.

562
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,250
There is also one other thing.

563
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,540
Speak frankly. Su Wen isn't an outsider.

564
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:47,130
I should leave you two be.

565
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,130
I'll go to the supermarket downstairs
to do some grocery.

566
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,020
I need to fill the fridge.

567
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:51,780
My chauffeur can give you a lift.

568
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:52,940
No need.

569
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,780
It's just right beside the residential area.

570
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,020
I'll walk. You two can talk.

571
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:08,780
I'll

572
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,250
put these in your storeroom.

573
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,700
You can put them in the study.

574
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,660
I'll handle it.

575
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,250
They are heavy.

576
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,850
This must be Mr. Youning's study.

577
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,090
Yes.

578
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,300
It sure reminds me of him.

579
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,180
This is...

580
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,730
This is Youning's notebook.

581
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,020
He jotted down unimportant stuff on it.

582
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,330
Lu Yang gave it to me.

583
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,370
Let's speak outside.

584
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:25,940
Sure.

585
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:37,850
After you, Mrs. Xu.

586
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,020
Have some water.

587
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,210
Thank you.

588
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,820
What do you need to tell me?

589
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,330
You see,

590
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:55,780
earlier on,

591
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,020
a client came to our office and made a scene.

592
00:29:58,730 --> 00:29:59,820
Someone posted the whole thing online

593
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,130
and Mr. Youning's history was made public.

594
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:03,780
I heard

595
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:05,940
you were severely affected.

596
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,450
The company also just learned

597
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:10,900
that Mr. Youning had built up a lot of debts.

598
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,700
Mr. Fang

599
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,780
feels sorry and believes

600
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:20,330
he

601
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,610
has been neglecting you.

602
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:25,020
That's why he told me to come here

603
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:26,940
to ask you about the lawsuit.

604
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:28,970
Perhaps there's something

605
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,130
the company can do.

606
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:34,780
I appreciate the company's generosity

607
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:37,330
and I thank Mr. Fang and you for your concern.

608
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,060
The lawsuit is still ongoing.

609
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,090
At the moment, there's nothing

610
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:43,820
I need from the company.

611
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,090
If I do need your help,

612
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,660
I'll let you know.

613
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,180
Okay.

614
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,300
Please don't shy away from seeking help.

615
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,420
I heard you found a lawyer.

616
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,060
You just met him

617
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,370
or is he your friend?

618
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:02,940
Is he trustworthy?

619
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,420
He's Youning's former schoolmate.

620
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:31,420
Hey.

621
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,250
Su Wen from the inspection team is here too.

622
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,420
Lu Yang gave Xu Youning's notebook

623
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,490
to Ruan Zhenzhen.

624
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,180
Ruan Zhenzhen is on guard.

625
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,660
Her statement was airtight.

626
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,660
Okay, got it.

627
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:15,850
Don't move. Don't fight back.

628
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,420
All people here work for me.

629
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,130
But...

630
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:25,730
Sir.

631
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,370
(Sir. Spare me.)

632
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,020
(Spare me.)

633
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,130
(I heard that recently)

634
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:32,450
(you had a huge windfall.)

635
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:40,980
Is this a joke?

636
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,460
I only have this.

637
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:44,340
The wedding agency

638
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,820
(hasn't paid me the rest of the money.)

639
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,370
(I get it on a monthly basis.)

640
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,490
Don't lie to me.

641
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,220
Everyone knows

642
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,370
you're in a lucrative business.

643
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,770
Even 500,000 yuan

644
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,060
is nothing for you.

645
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,410
I don't have any money. I...

646
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,170
Sir.

647
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:01,740
You have the wrong person.

648
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,820
(I'm a wedding ceremony emcee.)

649
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,890
(I earn peanuts.)

650

(I don't have several hundred thousand yuan.)

Oh, Mr. Xia.

652

Don't humble yourself so

653
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,530
before me.

654
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,410
No, no.

655
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,460
Sir, you got the wrong person.

656
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:21,700
You're not Xia Xinliang?

657
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,530
I'm not Xia Xinliang.

658

Speak.

Who told you to impersonate Xia Xinliang?

669

I have no idea.

670
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:10,930
What?

671
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:14,860

(Someone posted the gig online.)

683
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,930
I merely received a call.

684
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,010
I didn't even meet the person.

685

Sir.

689

about the situation

00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:45,860
(and what I should reply.)

692
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,180
(She said if I could do this,)

693
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,690
(she would give me 5,000 yuan.)

694
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,100
You have the gift of acting then.

695
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,690
Sir. Sir.

696
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,340
You flatter me.

697
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,340
I'm just a fool.

698
00:34:59,340 --> 00:34:59,820
(Liu.)

699
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:02,140
Ask him

700
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:03,180
why he had Xia Xinliang's

701
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:03,730
phone.

702
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,010
If you didn't meet Xia Xinliang,

703
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,380
why did you have his phone?

704
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,340
Phone?

705
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,420
Phone. Phone.

706
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:16,340
The phone is mine.

707
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,490
The SIM card was delivered to me

708
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,690
by the woman.

709
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,530
(She told me to throw it away once I'm done with it.)

710
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:22,820
Sir.

711
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:25,140
A woman told you to impersonate

712
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:25,930
Xia Xinliang?

713
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,970
It was a female voice.

714
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,420
You're done with the dishes?

715
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,140
Qiu Zhijian

716
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,380
seems to think this notebook is very important?

717
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,490
He wanted to read it,

718
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,530
but I stopped him in time.

719
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,620
I then put it away.

720
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:00,690
But there's nothing important

721
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:01,580
on the notebook.

722
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,420
I leafed it through.

723
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,140
There are only

724
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:05,900
trivial matters on it.

725
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:10,490
Judging from its content,

726
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:12,060
it's not an important item.

727
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:13,100
Otherwise,

728
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,340
you wouldn't be able to keep it.

729
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,770
But it contains much information

730
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:18,660
regarding Xu Youning's day-to-day life.

731
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,580
If we combine them with other information,

732
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,180
we might be able to get something.

733
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:23,450
I'll take it with me then.

734
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:24,930
I'll read it when I have the time.

735
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:25,820
Sure.

736
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,420
Do you have another hard copy

737
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,340
of your lawsuit documents?

738
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,140
Give it to me.

739
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,420
Why do you need it?

740
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,860
To study it when I have the time.

741
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:44,820
Thank you.

742
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:45,860
Oh.

743
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,100
You have your bank statement, don't you?

744
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,420
Give me one copy.

745
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:52,010
Gao Jun has them.

746
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:53,340
I only have one copy.

747
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,930
A woman?

748
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:04,620
A woman meddled

749
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,580
in Xia Xinliang's affair?

750
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:09,690
Let me take a call.

751
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,380
Okay.

752
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:13,970
Yes, Zhenzhen?

753
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:15,180
Gao Jun.

754
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,530
Are you in Nanzhou?

755
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,210
Yes. What's up?

756
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:21,530
Do you still have

757
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,530
my bank statement?

758
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:24,770
When are you free?

759
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:25,900
I would like to get them.

760
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,250
I'll get them from him.

761
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:33,730
Hello?

762
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,660
I'm outside now.

763
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,770
I don't have them with me.

764
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:42,770
You know what?

765
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:43,490
I'll send them to you

766
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:44,210
when I'm free.

767
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,340
No need.

768
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,690
When are you returning to your hotel?

769
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:48,620
I'll come to you.

770
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,730
When?

771
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,530
Tonight, I guess.

772
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:57,620
Are you free tonight?

773
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,770
Don't you have to work in the restaurant?

774
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,060
Tonight can do.

775
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:06,060
I'll meet you tonight.

776
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:08,100
Let's talk later.

777
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,010
What's the matter?

778
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,730
Nothing. He's busy now.

779
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,060
We'll meet tonight.

780
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,340
You're hiding something from me.

781
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:23,770
No.

782
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,420
No way.

783
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,820
I don't have anything to hide from you.

784
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,690
He asked you

785
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:33,530
to go to his hotel to collect it at night.

786
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:34,580
He even said

787
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,930
you need to come later at night.

788
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,340
You will be doing this golden opportunity

789
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,140
injustice

790
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,450
if you two are not making use of it.

791
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,340
Su.

792
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:43,730
Please clean

793
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:44,730
your

794
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:46,060
dirty mind.

795
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,180
What do you put

796
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,210
in your brain?

797
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:49,210
Good things.

798
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,060
Let's go now.

799
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:51,860
I'll give you a lift.

800
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,100
I want to get some air too.

801
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,420
Just so you know,

802
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,690
don't be naive, Ruan Zhenzhen.

803
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:58,900
Even if it's Gao Jun,

804
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,210
don't think men

805
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:01,900
are moral and virtuous.

806
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,690
Men are always...

807
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:04,060
Yes. Yes.

808
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:19,900
[Police]

809
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:41,580
Hello?

810
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:42,690
At home now?

811
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:44,290
No.

812
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:45,860
I just left the police station.

813
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,010
Why? What happened?

814
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:50,690
Officer Chen who visited me

815
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:51,660
called me

816
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,930
and said they found Xu Youning's key pouch

817
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,180
in Lu Yang's car.

818
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:55,620
Boss.

819
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,290
I found you the drone.

820
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,380
Why the hurry?

821
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:01,930
That's not unexpected.

822
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,660
You already suspected that Lu Yang

823
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,060
took the key pouch, didn't you?

824
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:09,860
What's going on?

825
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,660
Someone ran into me.

826
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:13,340
Can't you see me?

827
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,100
Watch where you're going.

828
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,060
Sorry. Sorry.

829
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:20,530
Hello?

830
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:21,930
Gao Jun.

831
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,100
Don't argue with anyone.

832
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,900
I'm fine now. Where are you?

833
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,660
I'll come to you now.

834
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,900
I have to work soon.

835
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,820
I'm running out of time.

836
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:34,900
Can you bring

837
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,380
the bank statement

838
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,730
to the restaurant?

839
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,210
Or perhaps,

840
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,340
I'll go to the hotel

841
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:49,340
once my shift is over?

842
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,140
Can I?

843
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,900
Or you can leave them

844
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,900
with the receptionist.

845
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,530
I'll just come and take them.

846
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,930
I can't entrust your bank statement

847
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:01,900
to a receptionist.

848
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,380
I'll bring them over.

849
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,490
I need to

850
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:05,530
tell you something anyway.

851
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,660
That's wonderful. Thank you.

852
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:08,900
Bye.

853
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,620
What were you doing?

854
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,900
Where are you going?

855
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,530
Do you want the drone or not?

856
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:19,060
You asked me

857
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:19,860
to get you one in a hurry.

858
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,860
Yes, Liu will come soon

859
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:21,490
and you need to teach him how to pilot it.

860
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:24,420
Also,

861
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,770
