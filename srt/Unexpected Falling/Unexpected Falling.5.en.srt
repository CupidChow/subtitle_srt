174
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,400
Okay.

175
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,280
See you later.

176
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,640
See you.

177
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,350
Mrs. Xu.

178
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:14,670
Sorry.

179
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,110
I had something to finish up.

180
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,520
Hello.

181
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,150
Would you like to order anything?

182
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,320
Americano, please.

183
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,150
Alright.

184
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,840
Mrs. Xu, you suddenly asked to meet.

185
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,710
Is something up?

186
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,080
How long have you been seeing Xu Youning?

187
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,880
When did it start?

188
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,150
Mrs. Xu.

189
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,320
Don't you think you are asking

190
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,440
a weird question?

191
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,200
How am I supposed to answer that?

192
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,110
Are you asking me

193
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,000
when was it

194
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,150
that Mr. Youning and I met?

195
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,710
You know what I'm asking.

196
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,790
What is this?

197
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,350
This is the watch

198
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,140
Xu Youning ordered for you.

199
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:30,580
Yes.

200
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,470
It's true that I like this watch.

201
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,110
But what makes you think

202
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,580
he ordered it for me?

203
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,870
Check the engraving.

204
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:19,140
Alright.

205
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,030
Even if

206
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,100
he did order this watch for me,

207
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:24,830
what about it?

208
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,590
Are you gifting it to me on his behalf?

209
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,460
I just want to know

210
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,620
when you two got together.

211
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:34,860
Got together?

212
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,790
We never "got together".

213
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,790
Then why did he get such an expensive watch

214
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,070
custom made for you?

215
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,310
How should I know?

216
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,190
I'm not the one gifting him a watch.

217
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,220
Right?

218
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,620
Mrs. Xu.

219
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,220
I understand how you must be feeling.

220
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,030
But I think

221
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:56,830
you're making

222
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,190
a big deal out of this.

223
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,030
Moreover, I swear there's nothing

224
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:01,860
between Xu Youning and me.

225
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:03,670
Our relationship

226
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,860
was purely business.

227
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,620
Anything else

228
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,140
was just casual flirting.

229
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,310
Besides, such behavior

230
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,190
is common

231
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,070
in this industry.

232
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,790
Casual flirting?

233
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,340
What do you mean by "casual flirting"?

234
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,590
Okay, thanks.

235
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,710
You're welcome.

236
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,830
Casual flirting

237
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,950
literally means what it says.

238
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,670
We're all adults.

239
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,340
A game played by adults.

240
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,070
There are only so many things

241
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,070
a man and a woman could do.

242
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:52,980
I don't get it.

243
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,260
Were you two

244
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,550
lovers or not?

245
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,590
Lovers?

246
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,260
I don't think

247
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,500
a one-night stand equates to being lovers.

248
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,190
Besides, from what I know,

249
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,030
I'm not the only fling

250
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,220
Xu Youning had.

251
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,710
You're his wife.

252
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,790
Didn't you suspect anything at all?

253
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,790
Every time he came home late,

254
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,550
did you think

255
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,550
he was working overtime in the office?

256
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,670
Mrs. Xu.

257
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,070
It doesn't matter what you think of me.

258
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,340
I don't have any ill will towards you, really.

259
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:42,500
Anyway,

260
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,740
I heard you're in

261
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,550
a debt lawsuit.

262
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,380
How is it going?

263
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:55,910
Mrs. Xu.

264
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,430
Seeing the way you are,

265
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:00,910
I really don't know

266
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,070
what I should say.

267
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,620
But as women,

268
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,220
I think we should have a broad vision.

269
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,190
Don't just fixate on love and whatnot.

270
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:15,950
Aside from men,

271
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:16,830
nothing else

272
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:17,550
matters.

273
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,550
We women

274
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,190
have many opportunities

275
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,340
to prove our worth.

276
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,100
In life, in a professional career.

277
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,980
In many aspects.

278
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,590
There are countless possibilities.

279
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:29,860
Life is short.

280
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,070
Since we're given

281
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,090
only one chance on this earth,

282
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,980
we should make the best of it.

283
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,790
I'm sorry.

284
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,140
I have a meeting later.

285
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,590
Let's

286
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,460
end here for today.

287
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,220
Mrs. Xu.

288
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,430
I know you don't like me.

289
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,830
But considering...

290
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,830
Considering my long friendship

291
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,980
with Mr. Youning,

292
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,710
if there's anything you need,

293
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,030
you can come to me.

294
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,550
I'll do my best to help.

295
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:21,910
I mean it.

296
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,400
[Ruan Zhenzhen]

297
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:01,620

What are you doing here?

302
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,260
What's the matter?

303
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,220
Did something happen?

304
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,590
Don't just cry.

305
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:35,460
Tell me.

306
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,590
What's happened?

307
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,910
Xu Youning had an affair.

308
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,220
What affair?

309
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,310
With whom?

310
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,220
How did you know?

311
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,070
When did it happen?

312
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,980
Xu Youning had an affair.

313
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,030
Hello?

314
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,860
Su Wen.

315
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,100
Can you get in touch with Ruan Zhenzhen?

316
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:57,710
She's not at home.

317
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,860
And she's not answering her phone.

318
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,460
She's okay. Don't worry.

319
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,590
She's with me.

320
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:03,590
I'll talk to you later.

321
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,550
[Pay what you owe]

322
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,460
Zhenzhen, wipe your face.

323
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,710
I've always fully trusted Xu Youning.

324
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,220
Even when

325
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,670
he left me with 40 million worth of debt,

326
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,670
I told myself

327
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,430
that it's not that he didn't tell me,

328
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:57,740
it's just that

329
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,790
he didn't want me to worry

330
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,100
because he thought he could take care of it,

331
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,380
and he would never lie to me.

332
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:03,740
He would never.

333
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,790
He always treated me well.

334
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,950
He didn't mind that I had no parents.

335
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,790
He married me despite the disapproval

336
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,710
from his family.

337
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,740
At the time,

338
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,380
that jerk at my company

339
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,140
bullied me

340
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,500
and sexually harassed me.

341
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,550
He went and beat up the guy.

342
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,190
And he said

343
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:25,980
I should quit the job

344
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,310
and he'd look after me.

345
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,100
Who knew?

346
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,070
He really had been

347
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,310
taking care of me after that.

348

Su Wen.

349
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,500
Do you know?

350
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,070
It was really hard for us back then.

351
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,950
After paying the rent,

352
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:53,790
we had

353
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,140
less than 500 left to spend.

354
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,740
Despite that,

355
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,340
he kept aside a portion

356
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,500
of his lunch money

357
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,860
to buy me a birthday cake.

I thought...

00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,380
I really thought

360
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,070
I was the luckiest person alive.

361
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,430
What did I do to deserve

362

I don't care if people like me.

368

How did I manage

369

to meet a guy like Xu Youning?

370
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,340
He spoiled me and doted on me.

371
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,070
I didn't have to bother

372
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,790
or worry about anything.

373

She told me

that my husband

377

flirt with her

Who is this woman?

383
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,670
She's just talking nonsense.

384
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,500
Who she is doesn't matter now.

What you're bothered by right now

Why is it meaningless?

00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,310
To me,

390
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,310
it's my romance

and my marriage.

after finding out.

417
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,950
I wouldn't have told her otherwise.

You wouldn't be able to keep it secret for long.

the only thing on her mind right now

is that Xu Youning betrayed her.

Just take it slow.

They're practically one entity.

429

It will be less when auctioned off.

516
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,110
Your car?

517
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,670
It'll fetch at most 60,000 in its condition.

518
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,780
Adding them up, it's only a 3 million plus.

519
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,390
So you'll still owe 37 million.

520
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,540
The creditors will not let you off the hook.

521
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,910
Even if they don't chase you for it,

522
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,300
you still have

523
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,980
to clear the debt according to the law.

524
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,630
When you owe so much money,

525
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,540
no company

526
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,870
would be willing to hire you.

527
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,300
Even if you manage

528
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,260
to find a good job,

529
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,300
you'll get at most a million a year.

530
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,460
How many years will you need to pay off the debt?

531
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,150
That's enough.

532
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,390
Is it?

533
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,110
No.

534
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,540
It's far from enough.

535
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,910
With that huge debt,

536
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,700
you'll live your remaining days

537
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,700
like a rat,

538
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,220
shunned by others, avoiding the light.

539
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,070
I heard

540
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,260
you were brought up by your grandmother.

541
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,300
If she knew

542
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,740
how pathetic your life is from the netherworld,

543
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:55,940
what would she think?

544
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:58,740
Just shut up.

545
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:00,460
Am I wrong?

546
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,590
Which part is wrong?

547
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:06,980
That is the reality

548
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,300
of how your life will be.

549
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,700
You owe 40 million.

550
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,110
Do you really expect to live a good life?

551
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,020
I will work

552
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,190
and use my lifetime to pay it off.

553
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,590
Your lifetime?

554
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,190
Do you plan to die alone?

555
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:23,830
Ruan Zhenzhen.

556
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,590
Xu Youning has blocked

557
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,460
every possible retreat.

558
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:29,780
You can't run away.

559
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,780
How could Ruan Zhenzhen do this?

560
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,670
Youning treated her so well.

561
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,590
For so many years,

562
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,910
he provided for her

563
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:57,630
and took care of her.

564
00:39:58,980 --> 00:39:59,940
In the end,

565
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,670
he got himself an ungrateful wife.

566
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,780
Where is her conscience?

567
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,390
We could

568
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,630
sell this house.

569
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,070
Sell the house?

570
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:21,670
We came here

571
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:22,910
because of our son.

572
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,910
Now he is gone.

573
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,500
What about we go back to our hometown?

574
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,500
That's where our family and friends are.

575
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,220
We'll have better support.

576
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,020
What do you think?

577
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,110
We haven't even paid off the debt.

578
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,150
How can we sell it?

579
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,630
A loan worth 40 million.

580
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,590
How can we get the money?

581
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,700
Our son was a capable breadwinner.

582
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,870
But that Ruan Zhenzhen

583
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:01,870
sucked him dry.

584
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:19,390
Hello?

585
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,350
Did it go as planned?

586
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:22,980
