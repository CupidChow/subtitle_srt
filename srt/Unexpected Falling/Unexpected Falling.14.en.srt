[Unexpected Falling]

2
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,980
[Episode 14]

3
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,310
It is highly possible

4
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:48,360
that the person

5
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,400
possesses your house key.

6
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,720
You should treat your wounds.

7
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,600
Xu Youning's key pouch

8
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,390
has been missing since he died.

9
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,800
His phone and wallet are safe.

10
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,630
Only his key pouch is missing.

11
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,270
Are you sure

12
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,160
he took his key pouch

13
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,910
when he left that day?

14
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,470
Before he died,

15
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:34,880
I gave him

16
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,910
a new key pouch.

17
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,440
I left the new key pouch for you

18
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,520
on the dressing table.

19
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,520
Is it too tight?

20
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,000
It's just right. Thank you.

21
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,160
Who do you think

22
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,000
has the highest chance

23
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
of taking away the key pouch?

24
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,720
Lu Yang.

25
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,520
Lu Yang?

26
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,470
Xu Youning's colleague?

27
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,390
Yes.

28
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,520
How tall is he?

29
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,360
Similar to Xu Youning's height.

30
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,030
Around 1.8 metres.

31
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,670
It's close

32
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,470
to your estimate.

33
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:58,910
Lu Yang.

34
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,750
I searched all over the house.

35
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,670
The thing...

36
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
The thing you want wasn't there.

37
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,160
Qiu only ordered me

38
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,030
to keep a close eye on Xu Youning's wife.

39
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,520
Besides,

40
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
I think he is

41
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,880
just a pawn.

42
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,950
I'm sure someone is giving him instructions.

43
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,500
I know something's fishy with Xu Youning's death.

44
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,480
I tried everything.

45
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,830
I gave Xu Youning's notebook

46
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,670
to Fang Jianshe,

47
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,110
but it ended up

48
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,440
in Qiu's hands for some reason.

49
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,380
I checked it. There are no changes.

50
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,600
All the pages are intact.

51
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,480
There are no signs of the pages being switched.

52
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,160
All right.

53
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,350
I understand.

54
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,390
Hello.

55
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,640
Mr. Qiu.

56
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,950
I am Lu Yang.

57
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Am I disturbing you?

58
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,200
It's like this.

59
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,480
Why was Lu Yang

60
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,110
the one who asked you

61
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:28,880
to go to the scene?

62
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,880
Shouldn't it be the police?

63
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,790
I don't know.

64
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,550
It was indeed Lu Yang

65
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,480
who informed me

66
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,440
that something bad happened to Youning

67
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,790
and asked me to go there.

68
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,270
You should stop thinking about it.

69
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,880
Stop thinking back.

70
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,040
I'm fine.

71
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,350
It's late.

72
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,440
You are very weak.

73
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,830
Let's stop

74
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,720
thinking about all these.

75
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,880
We'll discuss it tomorrow.

76
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,970
[Su Wen]

77
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,100
It's Su Wen.

78
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,600
You are really here.

79
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:11,920
What happened to your arm?

80
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,920
It's nothing.

81
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,230
Let's talk inside.

82
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,230
What happened?

83
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,160
A few days ago,

84
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,640
I scratched my arm.

85
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,390
The wound opened just now.

86
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,160
It's nothing much.

87
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,390
Why are you here again?

88
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,720
Didn't I tell you

89
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,550
not to come here?

90
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,640
I'm here with her.

91
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,070
I'm still worried,

92
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:45,830
so I came to visit her.

93
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,230
How are you?

94
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:47,790
Why did you

95
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,880
pass out suddenly?

96
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,110
I'm fine.

97
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,670
My blood sugar level was low.

98
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,600
Then...

99
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,950
Gao Jun, help me put this

100
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,480
on the bookshelf.

101
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:18,950
Don't tell her

102
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,880
that someone broke into my house.

103
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,390
Lu Yang said

104
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,790
he waited outside

105
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:33,640
until half past eleven

106
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,230
before he saw Xu Youning's lover

107
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,880
bringing another man back.

108
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,150
Lu Yang knows the man.

109
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,080
He is an attorney.

110
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,350
He is involved in the lawsuit now.

111
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,470
It's normal to find an attorney.

112
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,400
Would she bring an attorney

113
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,440
with a normal relationship

114
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,590
back to her house at midnight?

115
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,000
You can't fully trust Lu Yang's words.

116
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,400
I understand.

117
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,080
I'll find someone else

118
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,030
to keep an eye on him as well.

119
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,840
Good.

120
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,280
Also,

121
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,710
the group sent a letter

122
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,080
saying that someone reported

123
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,020
about Anhe Travel.

124
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,640
Someone in the group

125
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,710
asked the inspection team

126
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
to investigate us.

127
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,520
Just let them investigate.

128
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,760
As long as Xu Youning's case
is still kept under wraps,

129
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,840
nothing else matters.

130
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,350
I understand.

131
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,110
Are you asleep?

132
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,640
Thank you for today.

133
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,910
It's getting late.

134
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,030
You should rest earlier.

135
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,320
I'll take a nap on the sofa.

136
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,960
When are you leaving tomorrow?

137
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,760
I'll send you.

138
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,790
No need. Taking a taxi is convenient for me.

139
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,230
What? Anything else?

140
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,790
Let's talk.

141
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,350
Sure.

142
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,230
As long as you are not tired.

143
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,000
Do you want something to eat?

144
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,760
You must be hungry.

145
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,350
Sure.

146
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,670
You can bring me any food you have.

147
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,840
Her fridge

148
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,150
is almost as empty as her wallet.

149
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,670
She only has bread and yogurt.

150
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,470
What do you want?

151
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,000
Yogurt.

152
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,350
I've really

153
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,520
troubled you recently.

154
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:22,840
It's all right.

155
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,470
Why can't I see

156
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,520
any picture of Xu Youning here?

157
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,760
Not even one.

158
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,590
I asked Zhenzhen about it.

159
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,590
She said it was Xu Youning's habit.

160
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,880
He only took pictures of other people.

161
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,150
Perhaps people who like photography

162
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,520
don't like taking pictures of themselves.

163
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,880
I heard from Yan

164
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,670
that you are also

165
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,520
a photography enthusiast.

166
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,670
It's okay for me.

167
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,910
I do it as a hobby when I'm free.

168
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,400
To be honest,

169
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,230
I didn't expect you

170
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:23,910
to be so helpful

171
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,230
as an alumni

172
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,790
that doesn't keep in touch with us.

173
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,910
Gao Jun.

174
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,320
Do you have an ulterior motive?

175
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,440
Su Wen.

176
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
You and Ruan Zhenzhen

177
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,550
are good friends indeed.

178
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,670
Just tonight,

179
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,840
she asked me the same question.

180
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,640
How did you answer her?

181
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,030
I do have my own reasons.

182
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,550
It was a crush

183
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,350
but not at the moment.

184
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,000
It was way back

185
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,470
when we were still studying at school.

186
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,710
I'm willing to help her

187
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,910
because of that feeling.

188
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,590
Gao Jun, you are lying.

189
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,550
What kind of girl

190
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,520
do you think Zhenzhen is?

191
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,080
What do you think?

192
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,400
Observe her when you get a chance.

193
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,440
Ruan Zhenzhen is similar to a porcupine.

194
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,350
So,

195
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,640
don't betray her trust.

196
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,110
She is covered with spines.

197
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,000
Only her underbelly is vulnerable.

198
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,470
If she exposes

199
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,520
her underbelly to you,

200
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,080
you mustn't hurt her.

201
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,110
I won't hurt her.

202
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,230
Oh.

203
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,790
Why does she like to use cash?

204
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,150
You noticed it?

205
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,350
She likes cash so much

206
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,080
to a point that it became an obsession.

207
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,640
I've analyzed it.

208
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,470
She might be influenced

209
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,440
because she lived with her grandmother
from a young age.

210
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,640
Old people like to use cash.

211
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,030
Besides,

212
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,350
she might be

213
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,790
feeling insecure deep down.

214
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,550
Her parents...

215
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,280
Her legal parents are still alive.

216
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,440
I'm not sure about her biological parents.

217
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:19,760
There was a married couple

218
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,030
that always argued

219
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,200
because they couldn't conceive.

220
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,590
The mother-in-law

221
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,640
adopted a girl

222
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,710
from another place.

223
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,440
Some people said she was picked up

224
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,230
and some said she was bought.

225
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,030
Anyway, the old woman

226
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,200
adopted the little girl

227
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,440
for the married couple.

228
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,550
After a few years,

229
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,200
the couple still ended up divorcing

230
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,400
and formed their own families.

231
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,960
They had their own children soon.

232
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,230
This little girl

233
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,640
was redundant to both families.

234
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,400
Thankfully,

235
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,030
her grandmother took care of her.

236
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,950
Brat!

237
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,340
Xiucai.

238
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,140
Xiucai.

239
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,500
Give it to me.

240
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,860
Move.

241
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,740
Come here, Piku!

242
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,950
The transaction records I made for you.

243
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,380
Come.

244
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,310
The username and recipient account

245
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,340
are exactly the same as the WeChat log.

246
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,380
As long as the recipient

247
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,500
doesn't check with the bank,

248
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,910
no one will know that it's fake.

249
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,740
Dribble past me.

250
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,860
Will it work?

251
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,030
Can I fool her?

252
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,190
That depends on who you're fooling.

253
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,380
You won't be able

254
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,380
to fool the court

255
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,100
but it's good enough to fool your relatives.

256
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,140
I have no choice

257
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,500
but to do this.

258
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:07,380
Give it to me.

259
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,070
You must remember.

260
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:10,860
This thing

261
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,460
is fake.

262
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,910
Don't assume it's the real thing.

263
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,260
If you take it as the real one

264
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:18,260
and someone reports it to the police,

265
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,380
both of us will be arrested.

266
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:19,910
Understand?

267
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:20,500
Yes.

268
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,620
I'll think of something.

269
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:23,830
Give me!

270
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,670
No cheating!

271
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,710
You are bad.

272
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,260
You're joining as well?

273
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:30,620
Here!

274
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,190
Go.

275
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,340
Nice!

276
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,710
-Look!
-Not bad!

277
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:39,740
Nice one!

278
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:27,830
Gao Jun.

279
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,950
What are you doing?

280
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,590
Did I wake you?

281
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,220
He has a key to your house.

282
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,380
It's too dangerous.

283
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,950
So, I asked someone

284
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,030
to change the lock.

285
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,030
He can no longer use the key

286
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:52,830
even if he has it now.

287
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,070
Are you hungry?

288
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,550
Let me make a bowl of noodles for you.

289
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:57,710
You only have

290
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:58,590
instant noodles left in your house.

291
00:20:59,070 --> 00:20:59,550
No need.

292
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,550
I'll do it myself.

293
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,860
Are you unhappy?

294
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,190
No.

295
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,190
You are right. I'm not happy.

296
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,460
Because I changed the lock?

297
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,710
Yes. Because you changed the lock.

298
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,460
Gao Jun. I'm very thankful to you.

299
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,030
But I also want you to know

300
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,550
that no matter the reason,

301
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,590
shouldn't you have

302
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,830
discussed with me

303
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,460
before changing my house's lock?

304
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,260
Sorry.

305
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,430
I made a mistake.

306
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,740
I didn't think it through.

307
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,070
Sorry.

308
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,140
Gao Jun.

309
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,550
I don't want to change the lock yet.

310
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,670
If the person yesterday was Lu Yang,

311
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,620
he has my key

312
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,100
and escaped twice successfully.

313
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,590
He might think he is lucky

314
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,430
and come again.

315
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,340
If I changed the lock,

316
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,260
he won't be able to come in.

317
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,310
What are you trying to do?

318
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,460
I want to install a security camera.

319
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,310
If Lu Yang comes again...

320
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,070
Again?

321
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,460
Are you so sure

322
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,590
that the person is Lu Yang?

323
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,100
Whether it's him or not,

324
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:26,590
if he comes again,

325
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:27,380
we'll know

326
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,500
who he is if we capture him on camera.

327
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,380
Didn't you say he came here

328
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,220
to find

329
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,180
something important?

330
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,190
Since this person came a few times,

331
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,620
that means it is urgent.

332
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:36,790
He was forced

333
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,460
to take risks.

334
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,830
What if that's not the case?

335
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,030
What if this person sneaks into your house

336
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,430
not to find something

337
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:45,910
but to

338
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,460
kill someone instead?

339
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,100
Have you thought about it?

340
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,980
At a place where you think it's the safest,

341
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,710
inside your house,

342
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,380
someone is already hiding inside.

343
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,910
He might be hiding

344
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:03,670
in the study,

345
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,670
in the bedroom

346
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,030
or even a spot on the balcony

347
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,310
waiting for you

348
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,190
just to kill you.

349
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,430
Can you eliminate this possibility?

350
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:14,790
Can you?

351
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,550
Even if you install a camera,

352
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,550
so what?

353
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,260
Even if you can

354
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,100
capture the moment

355
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:21,830
when he commits the murder,

356
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,950
so what?

357
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,830
Remember to keep the key.

358
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,070
Thank you.

359
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,710
I've put the new key

360
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,980
and your old lock

361
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,140
on the shoe cabinet.

362
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,340
If you want to change it back,

363
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,980
you can call someone to do it.

364
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:33,830
I'll return to Beiling today

365
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,460
because something came up at the firm.

366
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:37,910
Call me

367
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,190
if there's anything.

368
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,140
Oh.

369
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,500
I repaired

370
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,220
your tyre and bumper.

371
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,380
Be careful when you drive alone.

372
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,140
Thank you.

373
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,220
Boss is back.

374
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:10,830
Boss.

375
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,190
Come.

376
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,550
You need to let me know in advance

377
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,220
if you're going to do things like changing the lock.

378
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,340
We did it for Ruan Zhenzhen's sake.

379
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:26,310
Sit.

380
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,100
Sit here.

381
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,550
What's wrong?

382
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,830
Why did you ask Qi to change the lock?

383
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:53,860
Are you sure

384
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,790
that Ruan Zhenzhen won't recognize him?

385
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,070
He had been there once.

386
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:58,860
The locksmith

387
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,710
our company hired

388
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:00,550
couldn't make it.

389
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:01,910
His wife gave birth

390
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,460
and he is in the hospital now.

391
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,790
It's not safe even if you ask someone else.

392
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:12,980
Qi, go back.

393
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,100
You can't show yourself anymore.

394
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,430
How long will Gao Jun be away?

395
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,140
Three to five days.

396
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:31,910
Try to get him

397
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:32,740
to come back soon.

398
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:45,860
What's wrong, Boss?

399
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,500
It's not going well?

400
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:57,980
Boss.

401
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:03,860
In the future,

402
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,260
we can go there

403
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:05,860
anytime we want.

404
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,460
As long as Ruan Zhenzhen is out,

405
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,140
we can search everywhere

406
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:09,830
around her house.

407
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,030
What is this?

408
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,790
I kept it secretly.

409
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:19,980
I'm telling you.

410
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,830
With the key, it's convenient for us now.

411
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,260
There's no need for you

412
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:24,830
to think of ways

413
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,100
to get close to Ruan Zhenzhen.

414
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:26,740
It seems hard

415
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,860
to get along with her.

416
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,070
Besides,

417
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,460
someone else is investigating this.

418
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,180
Your identity

419
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,740
might be exposed

420
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,340
sooner or later.

421
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,100
Our company is rushing us.

422
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,100
You need to be quick.

423
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,550
Did you buy a branded lock?

424
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,620
Of course.

425
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,670
Not only is it branded,

426
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:49,550
but it's also a famous brand.

427
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,710
The quality is assured.

428
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,790
You can search on the internet.

429
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,620
Since it's a branded lock,

430
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:57,910
the number of keys

431
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,030
should be fixed.

432
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:02,860
Since it's a branded lock,

433
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,620
won't she find out

434
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,260
how many keys

435
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,030
are included

436
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,030
with this lock?

437
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,190
You even stole the keys.

438
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,140
Do you think she is stupid?

439
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,140
What if she finds out?

440
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,670
Tell me.

441
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,950
If Ruan Zhenzhen asks me

442
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,790
why one of the keys went missing,

443
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,380
how should I answer her?

444
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:29,710
Besides,

445
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,100
we can't break the law while investigating.

446
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:31,590
Is that

447
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,460
how your company does things?

448
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,340
Hurry up.

449
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,030
Fine.

450
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:49,950
Sorry.

451
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,310
I forgot about your arm.

452
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:51,860
Let me tell you.

453
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,100
This kid is a fool.

454
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,950
It'll get worse if you hit him.

455
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,590
Are you a fool as well?

456
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,790
Yes.

457
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,860
Calm down and take a puff.

458
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,670
No. It reeks.

459
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,670
I forgot.

460
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,220
Mr. Gao doesn't smoke.

461
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,420
I've put the new key

462
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,630
and your old lock

463
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,750
on the shoe cabinet.

464
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:52,990
All right.

465
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:57,630
What do we do now?

466
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:00,140
Is the key

467
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,380
really with Lu Yang?

468
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,230
Do you think

469
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,300
he is looking for the same thing as us?

470
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,300
Everything

471
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,180
is strange about this.

472
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:12,900
Why don't we ask

473
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,140
Wu to investigate Lu Yang?

474
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,590
Don't lose our focus.

475
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,350
No matter who it is or what they want to do,

476
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,180
we need to do it before them.

477
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,300
As for Xia Xinliang,

478
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:24,870
keep looking for him.

479
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:25,990
Why?

480
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,630
We are investigating Xu Youning.

481
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,350
So, we still need

482
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,350
to cope with Ruan Zhenzhen.

483
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,870
We need to act fast

484
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,750
and get the things she wants

485
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,950
so we can control her

486
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,710
and get her to do

487
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,110
the things we want her to do.

488
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,540
Are you still keeping in touch

489
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:49,750
with that gang?

490
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,070
Which gang?

491
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,070
Stop pretending.

492
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,540
The money lenders?

493
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:02,300
We have meals occasionally.

494
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,380
They would invite me.

495
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,710
We are friends after all.

496
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:07,540
I couldn't reject them

497
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,710
when they invited me,

498
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,230
right?

499
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:10,870
Contact them.

500
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,500
See if any one of them

501
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,420
is targeting Ruan Zhenzhen.

502
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,590
Ruan Zhenzhen's rear tyre

503
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,830
was punctured with nails.

504
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,300
Wasn't it Qi who did that

505
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,830
to create an opportunity for you?

506
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,540
I only punctured the front tyre! Not the rear!

507
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,870
Shut up!

508
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:28,710
Contact them.

509
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:29,950
Ask them

510
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,070
not to back Ruan Zhenzhen into a corner.

511
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,300
Sure.

512
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,500
It'll be done with a call.

513
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,140
Don't worry.

514
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:37,710
What about you?

515
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,900
Will you stay here?

516
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,420
I need to visit An Ruiyun.

517
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:48,950
You are

518
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,020
looking for trouble.
