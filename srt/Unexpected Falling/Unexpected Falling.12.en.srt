[Unexpected Falling]

2
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,740
[Episode 12]

3
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,480
Just a few days ago,

4
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,440
Mr. Gao's coat got ruined

5
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,160
because of me.

6
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,400
I got him a new one as a replacement.

7
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,080
That ate into it.

8
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,630
Aside from that,

9
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,720
I spent it on the lawsuit.

10
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,120
This is all that's left.

11
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,510
You think I'll believe your words?

12
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,600
I've told all of you.

13
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,960
I really have no money.

14
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,880
I can't even take care of myself.

15
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,360
How can I help pay your mortgages?

16
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,110
It's no use in forcing me.

17
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,600
Zhenzhen.

18
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,550
We are not here to ask you for money.

19
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,800
Without Youning,

20
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,160
both of us

21
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,320
can't afford to pay for the house.

22
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,800
But we can't just leave the mortgage

23
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,000
without paying.

24
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,750
So we discussed and decided

25
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,830
to rent our house out.

26
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,000
With the rent

27
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
and both our pensions,

28
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,390
it is still enough for our living expenses

29
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,470
after paying the mortgage.

30
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,030
It won't burden you too much.

31
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,830
Rent the house out?

32
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,270
We already rented it out.

33
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,360
Rent...

34
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,240
Are you going to

35
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,670
move in with me?

36
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,320
What's wrong?

37
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,160
Can't we stay here?

38
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,750
My son bought this house.

39
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,880
The attorney said

40
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,550
this house is Youning's.

41
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,240
One-third of it

42
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,320
belongs to us.

43
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,960
One-third of the house belongs to you.

44
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,190
We can discuss this

45
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,160
in the future

46
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,360
when we have time.

47
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,960
But all of you

48
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,080
clearly know

49
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,160
that Xu Youning's debt

50
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,190
is 40 million yuan.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,880
Are you going to

52
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,110
shoulder one-third of it?

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,080
Sure.

54
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,830
We can shoulder it.

55
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,630
If the case outcome is issued,

56
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,670
we can shoulder it.

57
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,520
Fine.

58
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,750
No.

59
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:22,880
It won't do.

60
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,390
You won't allow it?

61
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,760
Who are you?

62
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,270
Who do you represent?

63
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,760
I am

64
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,880
from Beiling Law Firm.

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,270
I am Ruan Zhenzhen's lawyer.

66
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,480
I have the right

67
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,000
to reject unreasonable requests on her behalf.

68
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,440
Mr. Gao.

69
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,640
Didn't you say you were busy?

70
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,350
-You may leave...
-Also,

71
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,200
I think the mental state

72
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,550
of this madam is unstable.

73
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,790
I suggest you

74
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,070
take her to the hospital for a checkup.

75
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,640
-You...
-Enough.

76
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,040
That's enough!

77
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,510
Mr. Gao.

78
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,720
This is my family's problem.

79
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,160
It's none of your business.

80
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,920
Fine, I won't butt in.

81
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,390
Ruan Zhenzhen, come out.

82
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,350
I have something to tell you.

83
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,110
Your relationship

84
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,440
was bad enough at the cemetery.

85
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,000
Why can't you sever ties

86
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,110
with them?

87
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,040
Regardless of what Xu Youning had done,

88
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,320
his parents did nothing wrong.

89
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,350
They are my elders.

90
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,830
They didn't

91
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:59,950
treat me badly.

92
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,040
Are you really going to let them

93
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,480
stay here?

94
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:04,940
What can I do if I refuse?

95
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,040
Look at them.

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,320
They brought their luggage here.

97
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,040
Should I ask you

98
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,110
to throw them out

99
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,550
or call the police

100
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,950
and tell them

101
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,200
my in-laws want to stay with me,

102
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,440
but I don't want them here,

103
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,040
so I want the police to chase them away?

104
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:23,950
Gao Jun.

105
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,600
What do you think I should do?

106
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,230
If we argue,

107
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,070
I'll be the one who will be embarrassed.

108
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,320
Besides, they really have no money

109
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,830
to pay the mortgage.

110
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,880
I also

111
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,160
don't have money for them.

112
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,320
Renting the house out

113
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,790
to pay for the mortgage

114
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,600
might be

115
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,510
the only way.

116
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,600
Both of them

117
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,510
are pitiful.

118
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,920
It is also true

119
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,920
that I can't help them.

120
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,270
I think

121
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:07,950
you should stay somewhere else.

122
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,000
Stay somewhere else?

123
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:11,440
Where?

124
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,160
A hotel? For how many days?

125
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,390
When will it end?

126
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,790
If I can pay

127
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,760
for the hotel,

128
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,320
I might as well

129
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,510
pay for their mortgage.

130
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,160
They are talking about
getting money from somewhere

131
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,550
to pay the mortgage.

132
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,040
That means

133
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,720
she still has money.

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,440
She does.

135
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,920
Let me see what she's saying.

136
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,230
That's...

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,440
They won't do anything to me.

138
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,640
Do you think they will beat me up?

139
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,160
You should leave.

140
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,350
If you stay any longer,

141
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,040
I don't know

142
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,110
what they will think of us.

143
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,600
Sure.

144
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,670
Minimize your interaction with them

145
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,760
to avoid any confrontations.

146
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:00,920
Also,

147
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,720
no matter what happens

148
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,270
at any time,

149
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,720
call me immediately.

150
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,160
Call you?

151
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,510
It's better to call the police

152
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,640
instead of calling you.

153
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,160
Will you be faster than the police?

154
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,350
You can give it a try.

155
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:13,760
Sure.

156
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,440
Hurry.

157
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,720
She's coming back.

158
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,670
Be careful.

159
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,910
You can stay in my bedroom.

160
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,910
I'll sleep in the study.

161
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,520
We'll share the common area.

162
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,910
I'm going to pack up my things.

163
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,400
Stop right there!

164
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,150
Zhenzhen!

165
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,080
Calm down!

166
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,470
Zhenzhen. Calm down!

167
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,590
Calm down. Don't do anything on impulse.

168
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,960
You hate me, right?

169
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,400
What do you want?

170
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,880
There's no point talking.

171
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,840
Here. Slash me.

172
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:42,840
Don't.

173
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:43,910
Zhenzhen.

174
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,150

It's fine.

Are you home?

No. I'm outside.

What is it?

It's nothing.

357

I just want to talk to you

The money here

396
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,540
is enough for you to pay the mortgage
for a few years.

397
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,860
If you think this is good enough,

just take it.

Then,

what about this house?

401
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,020
The house...

402
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,620
The plaintiffs have applied for

403
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,740
property preservation on the house.

404
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,460
Unless Ruan Zhenzhen

405
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,740
can return the 40 million yuan,

406

otherwise, once the case outcome is issued,

407

the court will auction off

408

this house.

409
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,100
None of you will get this house.

410
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,980
I'm going to send a text.

411
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,380
What should we do? Should we take it?

412
00:25:59,140 --> 00:25:59,860
Say something.

413
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,340
Have you made up your mind?

414
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,500
Ruan Zhenzhen has 40 million yuan.

415
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,260
Are you going to brush us off

416
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,140
with this amount?

417
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,700
It's your choice not to accept the money.

418
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,140
If you stay here

419
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,180
until the case ends,

420
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,460
you will be chased out of the house

421
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,500
by the court.

422
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,380
As a lawyer,

423
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,580
I can tell you responsibly

424
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:39,940
that you won't

425
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,140
get anything in the end.

426
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,220
Should we take it?

427
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,660
Say something. Do you want to take it?

428
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,220
What's going on?

429
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,220
Why does it hit a limit down
when the market opens?

430
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,060
Go and get more money.

431
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,740
If you don't have money,

432
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,060
you will end up with nothing.

433
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,020
You are also using leverage.

434
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,340
You'll lose everything if that happens.

435
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:29,860
No.

436
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,140
Where do I get the money from?

437
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,580
I would've covered the position if I had money.

438
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,860
Why are you panicking? Answer the phone.

439
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,220
Hello. Yu?

440
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,380
What are you doing?

441
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,980
I'm not doing anything.

442
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,780
I came out to replenish some items.

443
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,060
Drive to Ruan Zhenzhen's house

444

445
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,940
and pick up my aunt.

446
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,300
Pick them up?

447
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,060
Didn't they just go there yesterday?

448
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,260
Ruan Zhenzhen asked them to move out

449
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,860
by giving them 200 thousand yuan.

450
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,420
Go there and help them.

451
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,220
Zhenzhen really paid them?

452
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,100
Cut the crap and just go.

453
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,580
Do you hear me?

454
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,820
Go and gather more money.

455
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,660
You're back?

456
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,900
They left.

457
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:56,780
They left?

458
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,420
Yes.

459
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,340
They moved out.

460
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,740
Why did they leave?

461
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,940
Did something happen?

[Receipt]

463
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,260
Where did the 200 thousand yuan come from?

464
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,420
Who gave it to them?

465
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,580
Me.

466
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,860
Why did you give them money?

467
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,340
What do you think?

468
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:45,860
Why did I do that?

469
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,540
I don't know.

470
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,300
I don't know

471
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,500
why you gave them so much money.

472
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,460
I just know

473
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,500
that I'm broke now.

474
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,460
I don't mind them driving me into a corner.

475
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,620
Why did you cause me trouble as well?

476
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,540
I did it out of kindness.

477
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,860
I know you did it out of kindness,

478
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,260
but what should I do?

479
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,250
How can I possibly pay you back?

480

Gao Jun!

481
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,180
There's no need to pay me back.

482

Just write me an IOU.

483
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,740
What IOU?

484
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,780
Do you know

485
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,060
I have a debt of 40 million yuan?

486

I'm in a serious amount of debt now!

How can I pay you back?

488
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,340
You can mortgage this house

to me.

don't you know

the status of this house?

495
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,340
Will mortgaging the house to you be of any use?

496
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,900
What else can you do? I've already paid them.

497
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,460
Do you think I can get the money back?

498

The creditors don't know about it, right?

501
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,580
You can mortgage that house

503
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,180

I don't need you

to write any IOUs.

507
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,700
You just need to pay me back

when you have the money.

509
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,220
Everything's done.

Don't worry, dear.

511

I'm still busy over here.

512

I can't pick you up.
