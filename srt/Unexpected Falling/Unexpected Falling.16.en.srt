[Unexpected Falling]

2
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,980
[Episode 16]

3
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,080
Is this what you wanted?

4
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,600
I didn't hear you at all.

5
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,110
You were too focused.

6
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,830
Are you hungry too?

7
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,800
Do you want to eat?

8
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,190
Sure.

9
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,750
Well, wait over there.

10
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,110
I'll make it quick.

11
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,320
Let's make it together.

12
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,160
What do you think they're after?

13
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,110
What could Xu Youning have left behind?

14
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,440
Could it be

15
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,790
related to the money Youning borrowed?

16
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,040
Maybe.

17
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,200
When Lu Yang dropped by today,

18
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,230
I secretly recorded him.

19
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,920
Do you want to take a look?

20
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,760
It's already late.

21
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,270
Let's do that tomorrow.

22
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,390
Okay.

23
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,390
Go on.

24
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,440
Tell me what happened.

25
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,160
Late last night,

26
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,000
I received a call from the police.

27
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,600
When I got to the hospital,

28
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,830
Lu Yang was in the operating room.

29
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,950
He was hit in the back of the head.

30
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,950
He's been unconscious.

31
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,110
The doctor said
there was intracranial bleeding.

32
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,640
They're continuing to monitor him

33
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,270
to find out the exact diagnosis.

34
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,920
Why did Lu Yang

35
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,790
go to the impound yard?

36
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,160
Could it be because of

37
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,110
what Xu Youning's wife said?

38
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,550
That's why he went there.

39
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,440
Did you find out who did it?

40
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,440
There are no clues.

41
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,440
Could Xu Youning

42
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,000
have left anything behind?

43
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,070
Mr. Qiu.

44
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,000
Stop dreaming up scenarios

45
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,390
and scaring yourself.

46
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,320
Two things.

47
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,670
First.

48
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,550
Lu Yang has to be supervised.

49
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,790
It's to ensure he doesn't run his mouth.

50
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,000
Second.

51
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,000
Pay Xu Youning's wife

52
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,950
a visit personally.

53
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,040
Find out her agenda.

54
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,600
How much does she actually know?

55
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:51,320
Also,

56
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,510
the lawyer helping her.

57
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,480
Find out

58
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,920
what his background is exactly.

59
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,480
Yes, sir.

60
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,720
(Xia Xinliang?)

61
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,600
(Yes.)

62
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,270
(Do you know him?)

63
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,230
(No, I don't.)

64
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
(Who is he?)

65
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,510
You're up.

66
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,640
(I didn't notice at all.)

67
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,720
Why are you up so early?

68
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,000
It's a habit.

69
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,640
There's porridge in the rice cooker.

70
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,470
You can eat it with the side dishes

71
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,200
in the fridge.

72
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,030
I've already eaten.

73
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,320
(Who informed you?)

74
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,440
(Here's the thing.)

75
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,230
(I was meeting a client that day.)

76
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,200
This is what you recorded yesterday?

77
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,150
It's my conversation with Lu Yang.

78
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:44,960
(I asked to go alone.)

79
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,080
(I was on the way there...)

80
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,320
What are you writing?

81
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,080
Can I see?

82
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,790
I'm writing down stuff

83
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,440
that I think is odd.

84
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,080
But my scribbles are messy.

85
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,590
You probably can't read it.

86
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,520
(I see.)

87
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,840
We can connect it to the TV and watch it there.

88
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,880
(I ran into Su Wen the other day,)

89
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,550
(only then did I know she's part
of the inspection team.)

90
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,230
(So we talked for a bit.)

91
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:22,760
(She told me)

92
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:23,840
(you found)

93
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,790
(a capable attorney)

94
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:25,910
(and he was also Youning's classmate.)

95
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,150
(Yes.)

96
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,350
(We went to the same high school.)

97
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:31,880
(Well,)

98
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,200
(how is the lawsuit going?)

99
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,470
(Do you need my help?)

100
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,230
(Oh, you know.)

101
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,150
(We're still waiting for the hearing.)

102
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,550
Su Wen is doing auditing at Jinshang?

103
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,230
What is she checking?

104
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,350
Su Wen briefly mentioned it.

105
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,400
It's a routine audit.

106
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,790
Today is the last day.

107
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,840
I didn't ask her more.

108
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:56,840
Continue.

109
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,760
(Mrs. Xu,)

110
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:01,910
(did Xu)

111
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,840
(really borrow that much money?)

112
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,470
(The other party has solid evidence.)

113
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,000
(So it didn't look like it was fake.)

114
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,320
(Let's not talk about that.)

115
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,760
(It gives me a headache when I think about it.)

116
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,030
(I've been so unlucky lately.)

117
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,230
(Not only do I have to deal with the lawsuit,)

118
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,400
(but someone also broke into my house.)

119
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,640
(Someone broke into your house?)

120
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,640
Mom, is it really okay for us to do this?

121
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,440
Why not?

122
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:17,790
I know.

123
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,550
We're giving her a taste of her own medicine.

124
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,520
Just do as I say.

125
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,440
I'm experienced.

126
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,200
Hurry up and go.

127
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,400
We still have

128
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,670
to pick your aunt and uncle.

129
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,280
Let's hurry.

130
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,320
Let's go. Hurry.

131
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,960
(Speaking of which,)

132
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:03,840
(how did you)

133
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,150
(get to the scene so quickly?)

134
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,400
(Who informed you?)

135
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:09,710
(Here's the thing.)

136
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,470
(We had an appointment with a client.)

137
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:12,320
(I was)

138
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,470
(supposed to go with Xu.)

139
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,960
(But Xu said he had to leave earlier.)

140
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,150
(He told me to go by myself.)

141
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,030
(I was on the way there.)

142
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,080
(While driving,)

143
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
(I saw a car accident.)

144
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,640
(I went to check,)

145
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,110
(and it turned out to be Xu's car.)

146
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,200
On the day of the accident,

147
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,790
Lu Yang and Xu Youning

148
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,840
went to meet a client.

149
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,470
Xu Youning had to leave earlier for something.

150
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,590
Did he tell you anything about it?

151
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:38,960
No.

152
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,150
When he woke up that day,

153
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,520
was he acting weird?

154
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,150
He was his usual self.

155
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,150
You've been briefed

156
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,000
about the accident.

157
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,520
How about the dashcam?

158
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,440
Did you check it?

159
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:53,840
That's one thing

160
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,590
I find odd.

161
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,110
The whole thing is odd.

162
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,200
Xu Youning's dashcam

163
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,030
and his phone

164
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,590
were both smashed due to the accident.

165
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,590
They were badly damaged.

166
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,520
It's impossible to repair them.

167
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,670
How could it be that coincidental?

168
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,710
It was a bad crash.

169
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,080
So it's not unlikely.

170
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,230
What about what happened after?

171
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,550
What was

172
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,590
Lu Yang looking for in my house?

173
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,080
Last night,

174
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,710
who was

175
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,280
the other man

176
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,520
who appeared at the impound yard?

177
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,440
What exactly is hidden behind all of this?

178
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,760
Is it only about the 40 million debt

179
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,760
that Xu Youning had amassed?

180
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,320
It's dawned on me

181
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,910
that Xu Youning's death isn't so simple.

182
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,550
What are you trying to say?

183
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,880
Xu Youning's death

184
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,320
is most likely not an accident.

185
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,150
In other words,

186
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,550
it was an accident with a motive.

187
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,030
You don't know.

188
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,400
Xu Youning's accident

189
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,320
was weird.

190
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:04,880
Later,

191
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,200
I did an experiment

192
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
at the scene of the accident.

193
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,710
Were you doing an experiment

194
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,520
or trying to get yourself killed?

195
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,550
What did the police say?

196
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,080
Was anything wrong with Xu Youning braking?

197
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,150
The police said no,

198
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,110
but I think...

199
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,320
Don't "think".

200
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,000
When an accident happens,

201
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,280
the police will check the scene carefully

202
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,790
before they categorize the incident.

203
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,710
Since the police did not categorize it

204
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,760
as a criminal case,

205
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,640
that means

206
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,150
it was purely an accident.

207
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,280
Don't think too much.

208
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,150
I wonder

209
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,200
how Lu Yang is doing.

210
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,320
If only

211
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,470
I could check at the hospital.

212
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,880
I bet he knows a lot of stuff.

213
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,840
It's just whether he wants to talk or not.

214
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:16,640
No way you'll do that.

215
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,710
At this time,

216
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,960
the police will be watching

217
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,760
the hospital closely.

218
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,350
If you suddenly

219
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,400
show up to check on Lu Yang,

220
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,840
that's as good as

221
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,710
inviting them

222
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,470
to investigate you.

223
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,910
I know.

224
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,790
I won't actually do it.

225
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,000
It's getting late.

226
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,350
Let's go to the impound yard first

227
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,520
and see if we can retrieve the car.

228
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:50,840
You all listen.

229
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,000
I'll repeat it once more.

230
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,590
If she won't give us the money,

231
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,350
we'll post this video

232
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,350
on the Internet

233
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,520
and let it destroy her.

234
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,080
Understand?

235
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,880
Yes. Let's do that.

236
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,320
Mom, is that really okay?

237
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,710
Aren't we

238
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,640
going to talk it out first?

239
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,030
What's not okay?

240
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,550
How can we reason

241
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,470
with unreasonable people?

242
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,640
This is how we'll deal with her.

243
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,880
I always say,

244
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,000
you're too honest for your own good.

245
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:13,790
Just keep quiet.

246
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,000
How could you let her bully you?

247
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:16,960
Let's go.

248
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,140
I'm going to get changed first.

249
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:40,470
Okay.

250
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:48,670
Knock.

251
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,260
Harder.

252
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,380
What is it?

253
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:21,670
The peephole is blocked.

254
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:28,950
What's going on?

255
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:05,790
Mom.

256
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,030
Mom?

257
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,100
Mom?

258
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:14,590
Gang.

259
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,460
It's the weekend. Where is everybody?

260
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,100
What can this video

261
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,070
prove, really?

262
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:54,830
It proves...

263
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,790
It proves Ruan Zhenzhen is not doing her duty
as the grieving widow.

264
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,590
She's a gold digger with a lover.

265
00:18:59,260 --> 00:18:59,950
Who knows?

266
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:00,790
You two

267
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,030
were already together long ago.

268
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,140
My son was kept in the dark the whole time.

269
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,020
If you think

270
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,140
the video is not convincing enough,

271
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,310
we also have photos.

272
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,340
What photos?

273
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,380
You should

274
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,070
have a little idea what photos they are.

275
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,380
Did you forget

276
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,340
the stuff you did

277
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,100
in your high school?

278
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,980
You don't remember?

279
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,910
Article 274 of the Criminal Law

280
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:29,590
is about

281
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,460
racketeering and blackmailing.

282
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,500
What you're doing now

283
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,670
is considered blackmailing.

284
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,430
Listen, young man.

285
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,670
Don't simply run your mouth.

286
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,670
We're here to get our money back.

287
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,260
Are you saying

288
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,740
not repaying a debt is okay?

289
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,100
Right.

290
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:47,830
Save your breath.

291
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,710
They don't get it.

292
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:49,670
Alright then.

293
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,260
Just give us an answer today.

294
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,030
Are you going to pay us the money or not?

295
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,460
I'm incapable of paying.

296
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,070
And I can't reason with you.

297
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,830
Let's just call the police then.

298
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:00,980
Zhenzhen.

299
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,310
You want to call the police?

300
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,550
Go on. Give it to her.

301
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,460
Give her back the phone.

302
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,500
Go on. Call 110.

303
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,710
Ask the police to come.

304
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,790
I was wondering how I could
make a big deal out of this.

305
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:21,790
Call the police.

306
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,460
Let all the neighbors watch the show.

307
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:24,830
Let's see who's the wicked one here.

308
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,590
Who's the lawbreaker here?

309
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,260
Got the money to keep a toy boy

310
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,790
but no money to pay her relatives back.

311
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,500
Let everyone see.

312
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:30,950
I...

313
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,070
Mom.

314
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,340
What are you doing here?

315
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,980
Wait. Why are you here?

316
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,620
I should be asking you.

317
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,030
I couldn't find anyone this morning.

318
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,140
If I didn't

319
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,740
have the location shown on the phone tracker,

320
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,790
I would never have thought of this place.

321
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:47,790
Wait, Yu.

322
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:48,550
Yu.

323
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,140
Wait. What...

324
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,460
Why are you all here?

325
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,340
Why does she need to pay you back?

326
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:58,860
Ask Ruan Zhenzhen.

327
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,030
Ruan Zhenzhen

328
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:00,910
took Gang's money.

329
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:09,550
Dear.

330
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,740
Let me take you home.

331
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,500
You're carrying our baby.

332
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,190
You shouldn't be moving about.

333
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:13,340
Come on.

334
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:13,910
I'm not leaving.

335
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:15,550
Hey...

336
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,310
When did she take Gang's money?

337
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,950
What money?

338
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,340
Previously,

339
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,380
your brother had an emergency

340
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,340
and borrowed money from Gang.

341
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,100
Mr. Nice Guy, Gang,

342
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,860
kept quiet about it.

343
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,140
And now Ruan Zhenzhen denies it happened.

344
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,030
It has nothing to do with you.

345
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,830
Mom, let me send Yu home first.

346
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:33,740
She shouldn't be moving about.

347
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,220
Yes, yes.

348
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:34,460
No, wait.

349
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,460
Take care of the baby.

350
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,310
-You go home.
-Let's go.

351
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,100
Go on. Go home.

352
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,830
What money?

353
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,310
Alright.

354
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:40,910
Careful.

355
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,670
Ruan Zhenzhen.

356
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,500
Gosh, why did you come here?

357
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,030
You'll pay up no matter what.

358
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,500
No.

359
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:02,500
Let's go.

360
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,460
Why should we go?

361
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,500
Hold on.

362
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,790
Explain it to me first.

363
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:09,980
Tell me, You Gang.

364
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,710
Did Youning also

365
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,620
borrow money from you?

366
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,030
Yes.

367
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,190
How much?

368
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:22,430
One... one million.

369
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:29,670
Dear.

370
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,830
Let's not add fuel to the fire.

371
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,100
Mom and the others will handle it.

372
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,260
Just go home.

373
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:36,670
Go home.

374
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,070
I'm not going.

375
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,620
Neither will you.

376
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,460
We're going to get the money back.

377
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,860
What kind of a person is she?

378
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,550
She'd even scam her own family.

379
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,500
This time...

380
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,860
This time, I'm going to settle

381
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,140
both the old and new scores.

382
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,380
If I don't get her to yield,

383
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,310
I'm going to change my name.

384
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,710
Yu...

385
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,860
You can't go.

386
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,860
Think of the baby.

387
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,380
One million.

388
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,430
She really has no shame!

389
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,740
No amount of money

390
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,140
is worth more than you and the baby.

391
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,190
Mom will handle it.

392
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,830
You don't have to concern yourself with it.

393
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,620
Mom will surely get the money back.

394
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,740
When did

395
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,740
Youning borrow money from you?

396
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:21,910
How come

397
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:22,950
you never told me?

398
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,620
It's before.

399
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,790
When is before?

400
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,070
In the past.

401
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,590
Hold on a minute.

402
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,910
You said Youning

403
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,550
took one million from you.

404
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,710
Yes, one million.

405
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,790
Where did you get the one million from?

406
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,070
Where is it from?

407
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:46,140
I mean,

408
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,860
it's our own money.

409
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,550
And payments from clients.

410
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,380
Our own money?

411
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,860
Didn't we just sort through our finances

412
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,790
a few days ago?

413
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,220
How were you able to lend to Youning?

414
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,860
It's been almost two months

415
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:05,950
since Youning's passing.

416
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,260
How did you lend it to him?

417
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,550
It wasn't much from our own savings.

418
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,220
It was mostly client payment.

419
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,500
Payment of one million?

420
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,190
Nonsense!

421
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,310
A guy selling second-hand phones.

422
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,670
Who would pay you one million?

423
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:25,830
Tell me the truth.

424
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:27,910
Where

425
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,100
did you get the money from?

426
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,220
I borrowed it for Youning.

427
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,830
You borrowed it for Youning?

428
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,980
Borrowed from whom?

429
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:40,430
Yu.

430
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,190
Can you just let this rest?

431
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,310
Mom is taking care of it.

432
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,980
She'll get the money back for sure.

433
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,710
So you won't tell me?

434
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,460
I'm going to ask Mom.

435
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:52,860
Yu.

436
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,790
Yu.

437
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,430
I'll tell you the truth.

438
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,340
Don't be angry. Don't be agitated.

439
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,140
The money...

440
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,380
It's...

441
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,710
Youning didn't borrow it.

442
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,220
I invested and failed.

443
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,220
I lost the money.

444
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,310
All the money we've made is gone now.

445
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,740
The house was mortgaged too.

446
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,910
If I'm unable to pay,

447
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,380
our house will be foreclosed.

448
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:52,980
Ruan Zhenzhen.

449
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,500
No matter what,

450
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,950
we're getting

451
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,140
our money back.

452
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,310
Zhenzhen has money.

453
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,070
We'll just borrow it

454
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,030
for the time being.

455
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,620
Once we've settled, we'll pay her back.

456
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,590
We will pay her back.

457
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,220
You can't go

458
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,620
back inside and expose the lie.

459
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,180
Yu.

460
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:14,380
Ruan Zhenzhen.

461
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,790
We don't care.

462
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,220
You will pay us today.

463
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:18,860
Just say it.

464
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,590
Are you going

465
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,860
to give us the money or not?

466
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,590
If you refuse to cooperate,

467
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:25,830
don't blame us for being ruthless.

468
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,340
Don't stop me.

469
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,220
What are you doing?

470
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,310
She won't pay?

471
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:29,950
Then I won't live!

472
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:30,670
Quick, stop her!

473
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,740
Get down!

474
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,670
Don't be stupid!

475
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,460
Mom, stop this nonsense!

476
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,220
Go home.

477
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:40,790
What?

478
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,950
Why are you back?

479
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,310
I want to do good for my child.

480
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:44,910
Can I?

481
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,070
Well,

482
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,380
I'm doing this for your baby.

483
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,260
How will you raise the baby

484
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,190
without money?

485
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,190
I'm here to get justice.

486
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,830
You Gang lied to you.

487
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:55,830
He lost the money

488
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:57,830
in a failed investment.

489
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,590
It wasn't Youning who took it.

490
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,100
Have you lost your mind, girl?

491
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:07,260
I've seen all the chat history

492
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:07,910
and the transactions.

493
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:08,910
How could it be fake?

494
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,710
You Gang fabricated those.

495
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:13,830
He just told me the truth.

496
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,030
What...

497
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:36,860
Gang.

498
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:51,460
Let's go.

499
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,590
Okay. Let's go.

500
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:56,910
Oh, you!

501
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:16,830
I'm sorry.

502
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,260
On behalf of my mom

503
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,550
and You Gang,

504
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,710
I'm apologizing to you.

505
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,460
Unexpected, wasn't it?

506
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,300
I'm over them.

507
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,670
Aren't you going to the impound yard

508
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,380
to get the car back?

509
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,340
Let's go.

510
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,340
Let me get changed first.

511
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,860
Are you sure can do that now?

512
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,310
Sure. Why not?

513
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,100
Do you think

514
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,140
I should break down, cry,

515
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,430
and let everything out, huh?

516
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,220
There's nothing shameful about crying.

517
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,070
If crying did any good,

518
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,860
I would cry for three days and nights.

519
00:29:58,910 --> 00:29:59,860
But crying is no use.

520
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,460
So why should I cry?

521
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,670
I won't cry.

522
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:03,830
Right now,

523
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,030
I don't want to drop even one tear.

524
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,260
With what happened to Lu Yang,

525
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,310
the police

526
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,590
will likely go over his social circle first.

527
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,310
You met with him just yesterday.

528
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,910
You won't be able to hide it.

529
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,950
They will probably question you.

530
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,430
I know what I have to say.

531
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,590
If the police ask you

532
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,910
what you and Lu Yang

533
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:43,710
talked about yesterday,

534
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:44,980
how will you answer?

535
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,620
Catching up.

536
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,710
We just had a casual chat.

537
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,430
If the police continue to ask,

538
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,790
where you were

539
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,550
and what you did?

540
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,070
Can I tell them

541
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,030
I was with you the whole time?

542
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,980
I mean, before going to bed last night.

543
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,430
Not before going to bed, I mean...

544
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,260
It doesn't matter when we were together.

545
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,190
So long as you mention my name,

546
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:17,620
the police

547
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,740
will verify the information with me.

548
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,380
Then they'll find out

549
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:22,220
about my going

550
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,070
to the impound yard last night.

551
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,070
It's better to come up with another story.

552
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,550
Try not to expose me.

553
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:35,830
Sorry.

554
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:38,620
I dragged you

555
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,860
into unnecessary trouble.

556
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,550
Yu, have some water.

557
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,830
Yu, drink some water.

558
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:10,710
Yu.

559
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,310
Don't fret.

560
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,460
Don't be angry.

561
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,430
It's not good for the baby.

562
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,460
That brat.

563
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:18,460
That You Gang.

564
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,260
He looks like an honest man.

565
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,550
And yet he managed to get into such a mess.

566
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,500
What I believed has come back to bite me.

567
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,830
Your dad and I were wrong.

568
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:30,500
I knew it.

569
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,590
I must have been blind.

570
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,710
I shouldn't have agreed to let him marry you.

571
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:41,260
There, there. Don't be angry.

572
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:42,900
You still have me.

573
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,180
I'll figure it out for you.

574
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,070
You hear me?

575
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,870
Okay.

576
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,420
Go and cover.

577
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,140
Over here.

578
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,140
-Nice shot.
-Nice.

579
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,470
I'll have one.

580
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,350
One more here.

581
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,070
Over here.

582
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,630
Let's go again.

583
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,470
Over here.

584
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,660
Quick, get it.

585
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:23,660
Shoot!

586
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,500
Didn't you say it was fixed?

587
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:27,660
Nice!

588
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:34,710
Pass it!

589
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,350
Me!

590
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:40,830
Okay.

591
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:41,750
Nice shot...

592
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,300
-Pass it.
-Over here.

593
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,020
Nice one.

594
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:48,630
Give it to me.

595
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,380
Nice shot.

596
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:50,950
Here.

597
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,230
Watch him.

598
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:52,950
Don't let him score.

599
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,470
So, how did it go?

600
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,230
That's a foul.

601
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,350
No. No foul.

602
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,300
Quick.

603
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,070
What kind of relative is that?

604
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,070
Over here.

605
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,260
Took tens of millions from others,

606
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,590
but couldn't even give you a million?

607
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,070
Let me handle it.

608
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:21,940
Shoot.

609
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:19,500
Not bad.

610
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:21,110
Everyone

611
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,260
can carry on with their work.

612
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,150
Ms. Meng.

613
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,910
Ruan Zhenzhen. Stay back.

614
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,540
Yes, sir.

615
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,500
Ruan Zhenzhen.

616
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,540
You are already

617
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,830
a permanent staff

618
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,150
at the restaurant.

619
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:43,150
You can't just do things halfheartedly.

620
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,460
Look in front of you.

621
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,460
It's as if you've not eaten.

622
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,260
I get it.

623
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,780
You just came back to the workforce.

624
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,260
You have your pride.

625
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,150
But you're not stealing or anything.

626
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,220
It's all proper work.

627
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,350
Why are you so scared?

628
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,220
I, Qian Duoduo, have confidence in you.

629
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,460
Ms. Meng.

630
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:02,910
Give her a hand.

631
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,260
Sure. Leave it to me.

632
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,070
Learn with your heart.

633
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,500
Miss, let me tell you.

634
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,150
First of all,

635
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,670
let's ignore whether we can dance well.

636
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,150
We just have to be into it.

637
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:17,740
That's right.

638
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,020
Look. Like this.

639
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,780
And the cutting vegetable move.

640
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,110
Watch me. Watch my hands.

641
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,870
Now, you do it.

642
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:32,540
Can she?

643
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,740
-Yes, go on.
-You dance.

644
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,910
Dance well.

645
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,460
Dance until you become the center.

646
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,020
I'll give you a bonus.

647
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,150
Yes, go on.

648
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,300
Go get the bonus.

649
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:43,910
Go on.

650
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:54,670
Put more strength into it.

651
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,070
Yes.

652
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,390
This isn't even the first time.

653
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,350
Look what she did to my son.

654
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,150
Look at the bruises.

655
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,500
And you!

656
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,390
How could a young lady like you

657
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,190
be so fierce?

658
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,500
What kind of a parent are you?

659
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,150
I'm really sorry.

660
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,390
You're unbelievable.

661
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:14,110
This is not the first time.

662
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:14,670
I'm sorry.

663
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,220
Let's talk it out.

664
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:16,780
Sorry.

665
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,300
The girl is too young to know any better.

666
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:18,980
Sorry?

667
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,910
You think a mere sorry is enough?

668
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:21,940
Haohao's mother.

669
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,870
Please calm down.

670
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:23,780
-Calm down.
-Let's all take a step back.

671
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,300
Calm down?

672
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,910
Who can be calm when their kid

673
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,670
is beaten up?

674
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,780
[Shangzhi Child Care]
Listen up.

675
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,590
I'm not going to excuse

676
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,460
what happened today.

677
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,190
You all

678
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,110
have to give me a satisfactory answer.

679
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:32,660
Yes, no excusing it.

680
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:33,780
I'm going to make a complaint

681
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,630
to the Ministry of Education.

682
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:35,740
Yiyi.

683
