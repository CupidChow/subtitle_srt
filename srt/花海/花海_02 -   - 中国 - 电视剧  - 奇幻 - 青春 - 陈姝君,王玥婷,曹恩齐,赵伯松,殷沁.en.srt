(Teacher's Office)

4
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,260
(What's going on?)

5
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,600
(Isn't this a dream?)

6
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,010
Does your leg still hurt?

7
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,640
The doctor said:
Try not to get it wet these days.

8
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,230
Niannian,

9
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,630
you've always been a student

10
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,150
who never needed the teacher to worry.

11
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,570
Why did you mess around
at the speech contest today?

12
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,640
(I really turned into Zhu Niannian?)

13
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,600
(Then the me just now)

14
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,680
(was the real Zhu Niannian?)

15
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,100
Niannian.

16
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,600
Zhu Niannian.

17
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,060
I'm talking to you. Are you listening?

18
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,850
Ms. Yu,

19
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,760
what did you just say?

20
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,100
I said

21
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,850
you ruined a speech contest.

22
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,680
Don't you think you owe me
an explanation?

23
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,600
The principal has asked me about it.

24
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,350
If you keep this attitude,

25
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,380
I won't be able to protect you.

26
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,970
Think about the consequences.

27
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,980
Ms. Yu,

28
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,510
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,510
I didn't think it'd turn out like this.

30
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,140
(What do I do?)

31
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,600
(Spirits above,)

32
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,970
(who can help me?)

33
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,720
I don't know

34
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,210
if this is
your rebellious phase or what.

35
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,680
But you have to remember:

36
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,040
This is the most important time

37
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,140
of your life.

38
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,070
You cannot go down the wrong path.

39
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,980
You must give me an explanation today.

40
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,020
Right.

41
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,490
Ms. Yu, right.

42
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,640
Rebellious.

43
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,300
I'm being rebellious.

44
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,480
Rebellious?

45
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,470
I knew it.
You couldn't have changed for no reason.

46
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,640
What's going on?

47
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,220
Something happened at home?

48
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,060
That's right.

49
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,260
Something happened at home.

50
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,180
I'm feeling

51
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,300
extremely complicated right now.

52
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,050
What happened?

53
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,260
Can you tell me?

54
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,690
Ms. Yu,

55
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,100
I can't say.

56
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,510
Why not? I'm your teacher.

57
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,720
I can help you.

58
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,190
Ms. Yu,

59
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,800
I really can't say.

60
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,600
Fine.

61
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,220
Go back

62
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,720
and think it over.

63
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,800
Adjust your state asap.

64
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,050
I'll help plead your case

65
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,930
with the school.

66
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,140
After all, you've always been

67
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,760
a well-behaved and excellent student.

68
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,300
But remember:

69
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,390
This kind of thing

70
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,720
must not happen again.

71
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,190
Understand?

72
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,560
Ms. Yu,

73
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,480
don't worry.

74
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,600
It will never happen again.

75
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,020
Goodbye, Ms. Yu.

76
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,430
Four days of class

77
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,640
and three days off.

78
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,510
Raise your hand if you agree.

79
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:43,940
(It's real.)

80
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,850
(This isn't a dream.)

81
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:52,690
Shasha.

82
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,100
Are you calling me?

83
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,140
Shasha, I'm...

84
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,100
Sorry, Chen Jing'an.

85
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,110
I've got something urgent.

86
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,190
You...

87
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,690
Talk to you later.

88
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,350
Sorry.

89
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,010
(There really is such a thing
as soul swapping?)

90
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,060
(Stay calm.)

91
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,180
(Maybe it will go back to normal soon.)

92
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,680
I finally found you, Niannian.

93
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,180
I finally found you.

94
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,050
Are you okay?

95
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,390
Deng Shasha?

96
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,980
What happened with your speech?

97
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,880
Don't ask.

98
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,640
If I knew this was real,

99
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,800
I wouldn't have done that.

100
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,470
I'm so screwed.

101
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,550
What are you saying?

102
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,300
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

103
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,850
Your mom's with Ms. Yu right now.

104
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,010
When you go home today,

105
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,180
I don't think it'll end well.

106
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,850
My mom has a pretty good temper.

107
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,360
She won't do anything to me.

108
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,230
Don't worry.

109
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,140
(Physics Olympiad
for High School Students)

110
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,830
Go through this set
in the next few days.

111
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,940
That's it?

112
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,550
What else am I supposed to say?

113
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,390
(If I told you)

114
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,600
(I'm not Chen Jing'an)

115
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,310
(and I'm Zhu Niannian,)

116
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,270
(you'd definitely think I'm crazy.)

117
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,470
Are you still mad at me?

118
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:02,730
Forget it.

119
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,840
What happened to your arm?

120
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,020
It's nothing.

121
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,550
I bumped into something.

122
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,470
Always bumping into stuff.

123
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,640
Chen Jing'an,

124
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,350
can you please act like a girl?

125
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,570
About what happened yesterday,

126
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,600
I...

127
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,510
Time for class. I'm heading back.

128
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,220
(Physics Olympiad
for High School Students)

129
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,100
Niannian,

130
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,640
did your speech

131
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,760
not go well today?

132
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,560
Today

133
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:15,890
was an accident.

134
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,440
It's okay.

135
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,060
I think

136
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,720
you're already excellent.

137
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,050
It's a competition.

138
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,680
You can't win every time.

139
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,140
If you failed this time,

140
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,930
just try harder next time.

141
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,510
I'll definitely try harder.

142
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,140
(Oh, my god.)

143
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,800
(Such an understanding dad.)

144
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,470
(Zhu Niannian is way too lucky.)

145
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,490
Huiru.

146
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,390
We're back.

147
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,350
- Huiru.
- Do you know

148
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,540
what your daughter did

149
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,050
at school today?

150
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,890
It's just that her speech
didn't go well.

151
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,050
Don't put so much pressure on her.

152
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,760
Didn't go well?

153
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,260
She practically yelled at the principal.

154
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,760
You call that not doing well?

155
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,440
What?

156
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,350
And you.

157
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,140
You're always busy

158
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,050
with the company.

159
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,670
Have you ever cared about Niannian?

160
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,550
Let me tell you.

161
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,680
She embarrassed me completely today.

162
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,390
Niannian, what exactly happened?

163
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,470
Today...

164
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,350
Today was an accident.

165
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:35,730
An accident?

166
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,060
Let me ask you.

167
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,100
Did you tell your homeroom teacher

168
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,360
that something happened at home?

169
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,640
I'm asking you: What happened?

170
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,870
You're even lying now?

171
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,890
Are you being rebellious now?

172
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,350
No.

173
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,550
When you were little, I quit my job

174
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,140
to take care of you.

175
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,890
I've given you the best of everything.

176
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,010
Ask yourself:

177
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:57,930
How many moms

178
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,510
would do what I've done?

179
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,350
And look at you.

180
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,550
To go against me,

181
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,930
you pull this stunt.

182
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,810
Do you think you've been

183
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,380
old enough to do whatever you want?

184
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,260
Don't get mad.

185
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,970
I didn't mean to.

186
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:12,940
I thought that...

187
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,060
I...

188
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,390
I...

189
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:18,730
I...

190
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:19,850
I...

191
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,180
I don't know what to tell you.

192
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,800
Didn't mean to?

193
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,100
I think you planned this all along.

194
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,810
Yesterday was your birthday,

195
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,640
and you talked back to me
at the dinner table.

196
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,350
Today, you messed around like this.

197
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,680
What did I ever do wrong

198
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,100
to make you treat me like this?

199
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,430
I didn't.

200
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:37,850
You didn't?

201
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,100
I gave birth to you and raised you.

202
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,890
Is this how you repay me?

203
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,470
Huiru.

204
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,470
Don't touch me.

205
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:48,850
Niannian,

206
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:49,990
apologize to your mom.

207
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,550
You were wrong today.

208
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,220
I'm sorry.

209
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,890
I didn't do it on purpose.

210
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,170
I don't even know
what you're thinking all day.

211
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:09,730
Niannian.

212
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:10,770
It's okay.

213
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,440
Go back to your room for now.

214
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,590
I'll go talk to your mom.

215
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,300
Chen Jing'an, come and eat.

216
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,800
Your favorite, Luosifen.

217
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,140
I made it just for you.

218
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,480
Try it.

219
00:12:59,010 --> 00:12:59,850
Want it spicy?

220
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,720
No spice, please.

221
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,190
Chen Jing'an,

222
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,550
I was too stubborn before stopping you

223
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,670
from joining the physics competition.

224
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,470
I take back what I said.

225
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,800
If you want to join, go ahead.

226
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,690
If there's anything
you don't understand,

227
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,070
you can ask me anytime.

228
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,130
Chen Jing'an, you're out of line.

229
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,430
I made this just for you.

230
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,550
(It's been a whole night.)

231
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,760
(Why am I still in Chen Jing'an's body?)

232
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,430
(What exactly do I have to do
to go back to normal?)

233
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,140
Chen Jing'an,

234
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,180
why are you zoning out
instead of eating?

235
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,190
Sorry.

236
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,220
Come on.

237
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,350
You've got oil all over your mouth.

238
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,510
(Grade 11)

239
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:07,930
(This liberal arts stuff)

240
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,430
(History)
(is unbelievably boring.)

241
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,640
(If this keeps up,
I'm going to lose it.)

242
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,300
Niannian, where are you going?

243
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,140
(Being the campus belle)

244
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,800
(really is different.)

245
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,800
(This science stream is brutal.)

246
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,640
(I can't even understand the questions.)

247
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,510
(How do they even learn this stuff?)

248
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,720
Kaiji, pass the ball.
Come on, let's play.

249
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:03,890
Catch it.

250
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,550
Come and play with me.

251
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,640
Tian Ye, are you crazy?

252
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,680
Tian Ye, ask Zhu...

253
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:12,800
Who?

254
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,640
Ask Chen Jing'an

255
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,480
to come out.

256
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,600
Alright.

257
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:20,730
Chen Jing'an,

258
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,040
someone's here for you.

259
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,520
Why are you running?

260
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:42,850
Why are you running?

261
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,600
I know you're Zhu Niannian.

262
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,640
I know this whole thing is insane,

263
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,260
and it's hard to accept right away.

264
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,350
It's hard for me too.

265
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,760
But we're stuck in this now.

266
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,100
You can't escape.

267
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:02,890
Come on.

268
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,760
Nothing strange happened

269
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,240
while you were using my body, right?

270
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:16,980
No.

271
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,230
That's good.

272
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,220
Why did this happen to us?

273
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,760
I don't know either.

274
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:24,850
But don't worry.

275
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,280
I'll definitely have your back.

276
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,180
You woke up yesterday morning

277
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,350
and found yourself in my body?

278
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,060
Right.

279
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,850
You didn't tell Chen Changning, did you?

280
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,060
He doesn't know.

281
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,470
Good.

282
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,510
Based on my initial judgment,

283
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,340
I think we've actually

284
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,640
swapped souls.

285
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,680
Swapped souls?

286
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,800
Like in those novels.

287
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,000
Anyway, I think we need

288
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,260
to keep this secret between us.

289
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,230
If anyone else finds out

290
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,600
about something

291
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,520
so unbelievable,

292
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,180
we'll be locked up
and turned into lab specimens.

293
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,390
That scary?

294
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,260
I thought we'd switch back today,

295
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,100
but that didn't happen.

296
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,800
Also,

297
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,140
I did something bad.

298
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,430
I messed up your speech contest.

299
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,680
Your mom got really angry.

300
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,240
She insisted I was doing it

301
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,680
to go against her because of something
that happened before.

302
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,270
What exactly happened before?

303
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,630
I also have a question for you:

304
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,710
Why did you ruin the speech contest?

305
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,300
I thought I was dreaming.

306
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,640
If I'd known it was real,

307
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,050
I never would've gone up there.

308
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,140
That contest matters a lot to me.

309
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,140
Especially to my mom.

310
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,440
But what's done is done.

311
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,030
Come up with a way

312
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:37,890
to help me fix it.

313
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,300
Think of it as helping yourself.

314
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,640
Tell me everything about this.

315
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,030
Think about how to calm your mom down.

316
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,050
Actually,

317
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,250
I don't think we need to force anything.

318
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,370
Maybe we'll switch back soon.

319
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,380
You also think we'll switch back?

320
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,560
Maybe.

321
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,600
But before that,

322
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,430
we need to exchange ground rules.

323
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,140
Ground rules?

324
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,350
While we're like this,

325
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,720
you can't do anything to upset my mom.

326
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,720
As for everything else,

327
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,800
I'll handle it once I'm back.

328
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,600
Can you handle it?

329
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,550
If we want to play each other well,

330
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,510
we have to know
each other's preferences and habits.

331
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,930
Like the things we must do

332
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,550
and the things we must not do.

333
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,760
If we still
haven't switched back tomorrow,

334
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,850
we'll meet here
and exchange ground rules.

335
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,220
Got it. Let's stay in touch.

336
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,210
Oh, my phone

337
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,760
is in the drawer of the bedside table.

338
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,280
You can use it to contact me anytime.

339
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,050
Also, before that,

340
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,180
if you run into any trouble,

341
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,030
you can come to me.

342
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:35,870
I'll protect you.

343
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,900
Well, time for class.

344
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,270
Let's head back.

345
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,430
I almost forgot. Girls like you
don't like physical contact.

346
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,720
While we're like this,

347
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,680
you can't do anything to upset my mom.

348
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,570
Understand?

349
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,450
Got it.

350
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,630
Do not tell Chen Changning about this.

351
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,430
Do you not get along with your brother?

352
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,180
Look at him.

353
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,100
Anyone who gets along with him
is the weird one.

354
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,140
Who are you?

355
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,180
It's me.

356
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,100
Deng Hui.

357
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,520
Come and help me.

358
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,400
My helmet's stuck.

359
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,560
Okay.

360
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:55,690
Mr. Deng,

361
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:56,940
what were you doing?

362
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,720
A souvenir from the planetarium.

363
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,270
I was trying it on.

364
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,300
But the helmet's a bit small.

365
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,640
Oh, right.

366
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,640
Weren't you going

367
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:10,980
to apply

368
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,550
as a volunteer at the planetarium?

369
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,850
They sent over the information too.

370
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:15,810
Take a look.

371
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,720
A planetarium guide?

372
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,260
Yes, it's a rare opportunity.

373
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,980
If you're interested,

374
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,180
you can apply

375
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,420
using the email listed.

376
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,540
But aren't you preparing

377
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,050
for the direct admission exam?

378
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,410
Do you have more time?

379
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:32,810
It's okay.

380
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:33,870
It's only on weekends.

381
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:34,810
No schedule conflict.

382
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,350
Even if there is,

383
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,180
I'll find a way to manage.

384
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,970
Do you know why I like you?

385
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,520
Why?

386
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,640
Because you and I

387
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:44,810
both share

388
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,100
a love for astronomy,

389
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,680
a passion for physics,

390
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,400
a thirst for knowledge,

391
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:50,810
and...

392
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:51,980
handsome looks.

393
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,760
I think you make a good point.

394
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,180
Let me ask one more thing.

395
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,000
If you love astronomy so much,

396
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,850
why not apply to Nanjing University?

397
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:07,910
I want to go to Beijing.

398
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,140
Impressive.

399
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,510
At your age,

400
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,000
you know clearly

401
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,450
what you want in the future.

402
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,350
Good.

403
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,680
No matter what you choose,

404
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:20,710
as your teacher

405
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,560
and your friend,

406
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,520
I'll support you.

407
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,520
Thank you.

408
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:26,980
I'll be leaving then.

409
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,720
Since you're already here,

410
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:29,770
why not try it on?

411
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,050
No class today.

412
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,120
We're doing a pop quiz.

413
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,390
Another test.

414
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,680
Tian Ye, do you have a problem?

415
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,050
Physics class rep, Zhang Kaiji.

416
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:49,690
Here.

417
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,100
Hand out the tests.

418
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,410
Finish them in this class.

419
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,300
I'll mark them
and go over them next class.

420
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,190
Okay.

421
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,780
Do you know how to do them?

422
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:05,890
Most of them, yeah.

423
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,100
(Grade 11 Physics PoP Quiz)

424
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,980
Want to copy mine?

425
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,230
No need.

426
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,930
(Grade 11 Physics PoP Quiz)

427
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,140
Hurry up. Let me copy yours.

428
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,430
I don't know how to do it.

429
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,470
Stop messing around.

430
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:07,760
Hurry up.

431
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,550
If I get the last place again,

432
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,140
Hui will kill me.

433
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,510
No whispering.

434
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,750
I'm talking about you, Tian Ye.

435
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,640
Sir,

436
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,470
I wasn't whispering.

437
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:22,300
I was consulting Chen Jing'an

438
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:23,750
in hopes

439
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,010
of soaring in the fields of knowledge.

440
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,970
With your grades, you want to soar?

441
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,860
You're more likely to drown
in the fields of knowledge.

442
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,520
Quiet.

443
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,640
(Work by Lin Yutang)

444
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,610
I saw this book first.

445
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,070
But I grabbed it first.

446
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,300
Pick another one.

447
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,220
I want the one in your hand.

448
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:06,890
Hey.

449
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,390
First come, first served.

450
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,100
Hey?

451
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,800
Chen Changning.

452
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,050
You probably don't know who I am.

453
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,390
I'm the school belle,

454
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,440
Zhu Niannian.

455
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,390
So what?

456
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,890
Are you even a gentleman?

457
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:45,690
Chen Changning,

458
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,520
that was

459
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,720
Zhu Niannian just now.

460
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,350
The school belle.

461
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:51,980
Shouldn't you

462
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,390
have let her have it?

463
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,890
I picked it up first.

464
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:58,270
Why should I let her?

465
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,770
If she wants to read it,

466
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,280
she can wait till I return it.

467
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,080
Wow.

468
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,300
God really is fair.

469
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,040
He gave you incredible looks and brains,

470
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,640
but didn't bless you with the talent
to charm girls.

471
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,300
If you can't get a wife in the future,

472
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:16,140
you can be

473
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,140
my son's sworn father.

474
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:18,940
Shut up.

475
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:31,730
Stand up.

476
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:35,930
Hello, sir.

477
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,020
Hello, everyone.

478
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,840
Your chemistry teacher couldn't come.

479
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:40,890
We're having physics.

480
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:48,090
Physics class rep, Zhang Kaiji,

481
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,800
hand back the tests from last time.

482
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,100
I've marked them.

483
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,140
Sure.

484
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,080
How many points

485
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,300
do you think I guessed right?

486
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,140
Wang Liqiu.

487
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:03,940
Liu Yu.

488
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,890
(I hope I get lucky)

489
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,680
(and guess a few more correctly.)

490
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:11,730
Tian Ye.

491
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,190
Zheng Chuan.

492
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,640
Chen Jing'an.

493
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:29,430
I've really drowned this time.

494
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,560
Chen Jing'an.

495
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,390
How many points?

496
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,390
Someone really surprised me

497
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,890
this time with their results.

498
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,140
Chen Jing'an.

499
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,610
Take a look at your test.

500
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,520
How many points?

501
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,350
Eighteen.

502
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,470
Are the new topics that hard?

503
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,210
(Grade 11 Physics PoP Quiz)
How could you fail as a top student?

504
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,720
Tian Ye's already drowned,

505
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,760
and you're singing all the way

506
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,760
down the drowning path.

507
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,550
I'm sorry, Mr. Deng.

508
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,050
Chen Jing'an,

509
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,210
don't take it out on the test
just because you're upset.

510
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,680
I know your level.

511
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,750
From now on, stay away from Tian Ye.

512
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,250
Don't let this happen again.

513
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:32,810
Sit down.

514
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:36,980
Okay.

515
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,430
Open your test papers.

516
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:39,980
Question one.

517
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,640
Chen Jing'an,

518
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,720
you're such a good friend.

519
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,680
You actually bombed the test

520
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,600
just to cover for me?

521
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:12,850
She seemed off

522
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,390
during class.

523
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,010
She's been acting strange lately.

524
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,440
By the way,

525
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,050
did Chen Jing'an sign up
for the physics competition?

526
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,230
No.

527
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:26,930
(Such a small age,)

528
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,610
(yet such a big attitude.)

529
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,470
Find time to have a talk with her.

530
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,640
She's a good student like you.

531
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:36,220
You can't let emotions ruin her studies.

532
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:39,890
Let's go.

533
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,510
So much food left.

534
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,600
I'm full.

535
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,220
I'm going back to my room.

536
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,440
Chen Jing'an,

537
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,230
wait a second.

538
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:12,770
Chen Jing'an.

539
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,270
Here.

540
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,970
Thanks.

541
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:41,550
Come on. Ready?

542
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,550
Do you want candy?

543
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:48,890
Thanks.

544
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,890
Too much candy gives me cavities.

545
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,510
Then just eat half.

546
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,220
It's really good.

547
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,970
I've never seen you before.
Are you new here?

548
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:08,850
I...

549
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,930
Did your mom abandon you too?

550
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,180
Don't be scared. I can be your friend.

551
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,220
Okay.

552
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,970
But you can only be friends with me.

553
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:21,100
You can't be friends with other kids.

554
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,370
Why not?

555
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,630
If you don't agree, forget it.

556
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,520
I'll do it.

557
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,010
Really? Pinky promise.

558
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:28,930
Okay.

559
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:33,640
