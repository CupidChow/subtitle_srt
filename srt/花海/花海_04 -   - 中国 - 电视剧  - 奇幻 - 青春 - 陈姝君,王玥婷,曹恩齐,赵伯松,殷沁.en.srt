3
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,320
Chen Jing'an,

4
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,930
what's your take

5
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,180
on puppy love?

6
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:14,860
Puppy love?

7
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,640
Well,

8
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,230
I think

9
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,100
having a crush on someone

10
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,720
is pretty normal

11
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,430
at our age.

12
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:30,850
So...

13
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,800
do you like anyone?

14
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,100
No.

15
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,390
Really?

16
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,980
What about you?

17
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,160
Is there anyone

18
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,800
you have a soft spot for?

19
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,510
Of course not.

20
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:56,770
Well,

21
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:57,730
if...

22
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,600
you did like someone,

23
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,510
would you date her?

24
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,730
No way.

25
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:10,980
Come on,

26
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,600
you're in high school now.

27
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,050
You should know

28
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,220
what's appropriate.

29
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,300
You look unsure.

30
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,780
I didn't.

31
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,180
You'd better mean that.

32
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,600
If I find out you're dating someone,

33
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,390
you're doomed.

34
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,350
I know.

35
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,290
Also,

36
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,300
no more hanging out with Li Minqiu.

37
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,480
Alright.

38
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,520
Wait here.

39
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,630
Why are you here?

40
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,720
Chen Jing'an, I came to apologize.

41
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,640
Look, I bought you snacks.

42
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,020
What's wrong?

43
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,510
Nothing.

44
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,890
I wanted to say sorry

45
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,240
for hitting you yesterday.

46
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,140
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,720
I asked around about your place

48
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,390
and came here to apologize.

49
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,720
These are all for you.

50
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,300
With all these snacks,

51
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,680
can you forgive me?

52
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,310
And

53
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,430
can you please

54
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,100
explain to Niannian?

55
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,640
It's misunderstanding.

56
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,470
You can rely on me.

57
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,740
If anyone bothers you,

58
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,550
just tell me.

59
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,430
Where did you get these?

60
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,390
Tian Ye bought them

61
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,850
as an apology.

62
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,760
Didn't he give you

63
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,600
medicine yesterday?

64
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,100
He said it wasn't enough,

65
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,220
so he got snacks.

66
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,850
But he doesn't live here.

67
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,430
So he came all the way for this.

68
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,470
Want some?

69
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,520
No.

70
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,190
Chen Jing'an,

71
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,720
don't forget your promise.

72
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,390
Your roundabout way

73
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,720
is quite nice.

74
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,720
What's your next move?

75
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:54,970
What roundabout way?

76
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,720
What puzzle is that?

77
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,390
Don't play dumb with me.

78
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,430
I know everything.

79
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,720
I always thought

80
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,470
you should be more forward.

81
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,970
Starting with Chen Jing'an

82
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,300
is actually smart.

83
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,050
(What?)

84
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,550
(Starting with me?)

85
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:15,850
(What does she mean?)

86
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,640
So what's your next move?

87
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,760
Next move?

88
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,260
No next move.

89
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:23,980
Niannian!

90
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,640
Yesterday was a good start.

91
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,050
Why hold yourself back now?

92
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,850
Niannian! Niannian, wait for me.

93
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:39,980
You order.

94
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,510
Hurry.

95
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,430
My turn now.

96
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,890
- Can you do it?
- Don't distract me.

97
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,010
- My turn.
- Let me try!

98
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,050
You two can't do this.

99
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:48,930
Are you any good?

100
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:49,930
Better than you.

101
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,760
- Not me.
- Beat him.

102
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,970
What are you playing?

103
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,940
Chen Jing'an,

104
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,220
since when are you rich?

105
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,800
It's the first time
you've bought so many snacks.

106
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:02,970
Is it because

107
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,760
I played basketball with you

108
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,220
and you were so touched?

109
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Yes, just for you.

110
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,510
I know you love me.

111
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,930
- You're welcome.
- Lots of love.

112
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,890
Chen Jing'an's treat.

113
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:18,970
Thank you, Princess.

114
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,550
Thanks, I'm good.

115
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,600
It's okay,

116
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,760
I'll save it for you.

117
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:45,690
Alright, class.

118
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,260
Let's look at this question.

119
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,180
The solution approach

120
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,600
will be key for the monthly exam.

121
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,220
Master this method

122
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,390
and you'll gain

123
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,640
at least 10 more points.

124
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,640
Tian Ye,

125
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,470
explain the solution.

126
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,100
This question...

127
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,140
This question...

128
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,480
Put your hand down.

129
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:18,730
Down!

130
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:29,690
Tian Ye!

131
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,800
Let's decide

132
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,800
what to eat first.

133
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:41,850
Niannian, look!

134
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,260
It's Chen Jing'an.

135
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,970
Let's invite her

136
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:49,970
to lunch.

137
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,470
Don't give up halfway, okay?

138
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,480
Chen Jing'an,

139
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,050
let's have lunch together.

140
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,520
Okay.

141
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,260
And me! I'm joining you.

142
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,690
Tian Ye,

143
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,390
I need to talk to you.

144
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,350
How's your nose?

145
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,100
Doesn't hurt much now.

146
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,940
Good.

147
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,390
What happened?

148
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,470
Eye pain?

149
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,190
Niannian,

150
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,140
ask her to help with the connection.

151
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,510
What connection?

152
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,350
Never mind, I'll help you.

153
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,600
Chen Jing'an,

154
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,760
try this dish.

155
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,010
It's delicious.

156
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:58,850
Thank you.

157
00:08:58,850 --> 00:08:59,690
Do you know

158
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,100
what Chen Changning wants from Tian Ye?

159
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,470
I don't know.

160
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,340
Why do you care?

161
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,550
It doesn't affect our meal.

162
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,940
Who kicked me?

163
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,290
Chen Jing'an,

164
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,970
your brother's outstanding.

165
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,140
He must have many admirers.

166
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,760
Do you help them
deliver love letters?

167
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,600
No way.

168
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,180
She wouldn't do something so tacky.

169
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:27,910
Right,

170
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,600
I've never done that.

171
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:31,690
I see.

172
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,100
You know,

173
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,050
Chen Changning is like a fashion model.

174
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,390
Even this plain school uniform

175
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,010
looks tailored on him.

176
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,200
And look at Niannian,

177
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,850
she's also like a model.

178
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,800
They'd look great together,

179
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,890
like a couple.

180
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:47,830
I think...

181
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,550
Here, try this. It's good.

182
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,970
Alright, alright.

183
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,140
At our school,

184
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,720
many girls

185
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,100
like Chen Changning,

186
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,600
but none are good enough

187
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,850
for him.

188
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,300
The only one

189
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,140
who matches him...

190
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,550
- Are you okay?
- You okay?

191
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,720
Chen Jing'an.

192
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,140
Have some soup.

193
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,560
Okay.

194
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,300
Where was I?

195
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,050
Oh, Chen Changning...

196
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,930
How many times

197
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,050
have you mentioned him?

198
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,220
Using him as seasoning?

199
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,720
- But...
- Alright, alright.

200
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,260
Let's eat.

201
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,720
The bell will ring soon.

202
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,440
No more.

203
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:06,850
I quit.

204
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,980
Exhausted.

205
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,680
I skipped breakfast

206
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,350
just to get beaten by you.

207
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,300
I need to ask you something.

208
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,390
What?

209
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:18,890
You beat me

210
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,300
just to ask questions?

211
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,930
Had to make you talk.

212
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,520
What is it?

213
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,520
I'll tell you

214
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:30,810
everything

215
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,060
I know.

216
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,890
When my mom hits me again,

217
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,180
can I reach out to you?

218
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,270
Back to the topic.

219
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,180
Chen Jing'an's been acting strange.

220
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,140
I feel like

221
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,800
she's been gentler.

222
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,520
Not the point.

223
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,100
What's her relationship

224
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,600
with Li Minqiu?

225
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,060
Basketball friends.

226
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,890
They met through games.

227
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,440
Why do you ask?

228
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,550
There's nothing shady going on?

229
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:04,810
Shady?

230
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,510
What could be shady?

231
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,300
I suspect they're dating.

232
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:15,730
No way.

233
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,550
Chen Jing'an and Li Minqiu?

234
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,930
There is no way.

235
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,140
Are you sure?

236
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,130
Do you know

237
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,270
who bought your yogurt?

238
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,450
Chen Jing'an.

239
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,600
No, it was Li Minqiu.

240
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:39,890
How...

241
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,130
How could that be?

242
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,140
She said she bought it for me.

243
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,800
She told me you bought it

244
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
to hide the fact

245
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,600
that it was Li Minqiu.

246
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,230
They...

247
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,140
How could they...

248
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,800
How could Chen Jing'an like him?

249
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,800
You need to pick the right side.

250
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,220
Don't cover for Chen Jing'an.

251
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,850
Tell me immediately if you have updates.

252
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,270
Got it?

253
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,720
So you want me

254
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,140
to be a spy?

255
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,270
No,

256
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:20,980
an informant.

257
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,640
Alright.

258
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,680
I'll keep an eye on Chen Jing'an.

259
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,890
We can't let her

260
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,550
go up the wrong path.

261
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,220
It's "go down".

262
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,430
You know what I mean.

263
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,800
Goodbye, sir.

264
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,510
Goodbye, class.

265
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,640
Why that look?

266
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:09,770
Chen Jing'an,

267
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,390
I heard a story recently.

268
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,010
Aren't you curious?

269
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,050
No.

270
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,970
Then let me tell you,

271
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,480
it's about

272
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,440
a native schoolgirl

273
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,100
who ignored

274
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,760
all warnings

275
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,890
from her friends and family

276
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,090
and got tricked

277
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,300
by a gutter guy's

278
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,480
sweet talk.

279
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:35,980
She lost her money,

280
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,640
her virtue,

281
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,050
and got disfigured.

282
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,640
Car accident...

283
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:42,940
Abortion...

284
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,680
She was abandoned by all

285
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,800
and died full of regrets.

286
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:49,690
That's...

287
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,140
so tragic.

288
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,140
You even believed such a fake story.

289
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,220
We live in a law-based society.

290
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,220
Such a thing is not allowed.

291
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,350
There are still many delinquents.

292
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,390
What if?

293
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,430
Not in this area.

294
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:07,850
Are you sure?

295
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,680
I think

296
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,140
Li Minqiu

297
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,890
is exactly that type.

298
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,100
No way.

299
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,420
Li Minqiu

300
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,300
seems unfriendly,

301
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,760
but he's actually nice.

302
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,050
(Oh no...)

303
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,190
(Oh no...)

304
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:32,470
(She's been completely brainwashed.)

305
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,050
(How to save you,)

306
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,510
(my friend?)

307
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,140
Niannian.

308
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:52,850
Li Minqiu.

309
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,190
Why are you here?

310
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,510
And in our school uniform.

311
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,720
I borrowed it to see you.

312
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,400
We haven't met in years.

313
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:00,390
How are you?

314
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,140
I... I'm okay.

315
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,600
After seeing you yesterday,

316
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:06,760
I couldn't sleep

317
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,290
all night.

318
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,100
No wonder you got dark circles.

319
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,810
For your health,

320
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,470
you should sleep early.

321
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,840
Niannian,

322
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,970
you still care about me.

323
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,300
When we were kids,

324
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,020
once after I got in a fight,

325
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,600
you cried but still put band-aids on me.

326
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,390
(I'm not Zhu Niannian.
How would I know?)

327
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,560
You don't remember?

328
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,260
Of course I do.

329
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,310
I just remembered

330
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,160
I have homework.

331
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,040
Let me walk you back.

332
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:36,810
Li Minqiu,

333
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,930
you're not from our school.

334
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:39,810
Why are you here?

335
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,550
What is it to you?

336
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,360
I'm the student council president.

337
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,100
It's my business

338
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,300
to take care of

339
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,220
any suspicious person.

340
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,800
How am I suspicious?

341
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,430
I'm your sister's good friend.

342
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,680
Did I approve this friendship?

343
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,050
Listen,

344
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,550
stay away from Chen Jing'an

345
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,180
and don't come back ever.

346
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:03,690
You...

347
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,510
You're so bossy.

348
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,100
I'm here for her.

349
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,140
Move.

350
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:10,890
Last warning,

351
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,430
leave now.

352
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,350
Fine.

353
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,430
I'll go today.

354
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,430
But I'll come back

355
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,970
with my men.

356
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,550
Niannian, bye.

357
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,390
(What was that?)

358
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,680
(Chen Changning playing the hero?)

359
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,140
Thank you,

360
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,390
Changning.

361
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,300
If he bothers you again,

362
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,470
let me know.

363
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,720
Stay away from people

364
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,180
like Li Minqiu.

365
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,470
Don't be fooled.

366
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:51,770
Fooled?

367
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,510
He's just a bit annoying,

368
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,550
not a scammer.

369
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,760
His kind

370
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,760
hides their tricks well.

371
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,010
(What's gotten into you?)

372
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,560
Changning,

373
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,350
your classroom

374
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,390
is over there.

375
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,430
I'm looking for

376
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,020
my teacher.

377
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,420
(What a lame excuse.)

378
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:31,850
(He's definitely unhinged.)

379
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,470
If Li Minqiu bothers you again,

380
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,680
I can help you.

381
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:37,940
Oh,

382
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,080
please share what just happened

383
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:40,980
with Chen Jing'an

384
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,300
and remind her to keep distance

385
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,300
from him.

386
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,640
Alright.

387
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,800
(Unprovoked kindness.)

388
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,600
(Doesn't seem like his style.)

389
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,860
(Could it be)

390
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,600
(he has feelings for Zhu Niannian?)

391
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:01,800
Zhu Niannian,

392
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,230
feeling unwell?

393
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,640
I have things to do.

394
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:07,770
See you.

395
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,230
Chen Jing'an,

396
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,510
here's the thing.

397
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,390
I think

398
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,680
your brother's words

399
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,760
aren't all unreasonable.

400
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:45,970
We should listen

401
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,060
to what we ought to,

402
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,140
and even to

403
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,020
what we shouldn't.

404
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:50,930
As for my words,

405
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,640
like they say, "Ignore Tian Ye's advice,

406
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,890
and you'll regret."

407
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,390
I really don't want you

408
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,050
to suffer unnecessary losses,

409
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:58,940
you know?

410
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,680
I genuinely want

411
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,850
what's best for you.

412
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,550
Don't let yourself suffer.

413
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,720
Your brother feels the same.

414
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,240
He may not care for you as much as...

415
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,560
Zhu Niannian.

416
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,800
Chen Jing'an, a word.

417
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:12,850
Come with me.

418
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:17,950
What's your relationship

419
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,510
with Li Minqiu when you were kids?

420
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,100
If he comes to me again,

421
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:21,940
what should I do?

422
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,560
We were neighbors as kids,

423
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,070
played together a lot.

424
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,680
He took good care of me.

425
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,220
After he moved away,

426
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,890
we lost touch.

427
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,600
Don't worry too much.

428
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,550
If he brings up the past,

429
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,260
just say you forgot.

430
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,600
It's been years.

431
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,600
Even if you slip up,

432
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,470
he probably won't notice.

433
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,350
That works.

434
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,850
He came to see me today,

435
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:46,930
and said all those things.

436
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,600
I had no idea how to respond.

437
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,930
I was scared I'd mess up.

438
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,140
Luckily,

439
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,010
Chen Changning chased Li Minqiu off.

440
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,350
Chen Changning chased him off?

441
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,290
Yeah.

442
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,120
He also said

443
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,470
a bunch of weird things to me.

444
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,770
Like,

445
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,220
"Don't be fooled",

446
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,510
"Many two-timers",

447
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,790
and all that.

448
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,190
Now that you mention it,

449
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,430
Tian Ye acted strange too.

450
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,550
Earlier, he kept hinting about

451
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,140
the dangers of girls dating delinquents.

452
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,860
And yesterday, Chen Changning asked me

453
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,210
what I thought of puppy love,

454
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,470
then told me
to stay away from Li Minqiu.

455
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,640
Today, Tian Ye drops these hints...

456
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,010
Do they seriously think

457
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,800
I'm dating Li Minqiu?

458
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,430
You and Li Minqiu?

459
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,790
Wait, it's you

460
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,220
and Li Minqiu.

461
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,550
How ridiculous!

462
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,980
Their imaginations are wild enough

463
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,850
to write novels!

464
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,640
It must've been a misunderstanding
from yesterday.

465
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,430
I'll talk to Minqiu about this

466
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,760
and have him clear things up.

467
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,490
Please explain it properly.

468
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,780
My flawless reputation

469
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,200
can't be ruined like this.

470
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,010
Also, tell him not to look for me

471
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,920
at school anymore.

472
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,470
And I'm Zhu Niannian right now.

473
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,510
Your reputation can't be ruined either.

474
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:58,850
Got it?

475
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,190
Five.

476
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,230
Four.

477
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,430
Three, two, one.

478
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,310
Time's up.

479
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,920
Forty-five.

480
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,550
- How many?
- Forty-five.

481
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,510
Changning, done?

482
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:27,890
I'm exhausted.

483
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:28,770
Sir,

484
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,970
here you go.

485
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,800
Take these soccer balls back

486
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:34,730
and count them.

487
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:35,850
Got it.

488
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,350
Look at your results.

489
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,300
You skip workouts,

490
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:42,690
and even slack off.

491
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,470
(Equipment Room)
Why here?

492
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,140
Niannian, Chen Changning

493
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,220
is waiting for you.

494
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,390
Deng Shasha,

495
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,390
what are you doing?

496
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:57,710
Done!

497
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,270
Shasha.

498
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,560
Why?

499
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,100
Niannian, I'll open the door

500
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,110
in fifteen minutes.

501
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,030
Shasha. Shasha.

502
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,220
Why are you here?

503
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,470
To return the balls.

504
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:23,890
Why did she lock the door?

505
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:26,980
Prank.

506
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,140
It'll open soon.

507
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,300
I'll deal with her when I'm out.

508
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,440
It's fine.

509
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:33,760
I'm not busy anyway.

510
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,850
If you're not in a hurry,

511
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,890
I actually have something to say.

512
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:45,980
Alright then.

513
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,470
Go ahead.

514
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:49,890
Zhu Niannian,

515
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,360
actually, I'm a bit curious

516
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,890
how did you become friends with Jing'an?

517
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,140
The reason we became friends

518
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,190
is...

519
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,350
that I think
she has a great personality.

520
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,100
She is sweet,

521
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,800
outgoing,

522
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:07,970
lively, and generous.

523
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,190
Most importantly,

524
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,050
she's a good friend.

525
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,680
You're the first

526
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,100
female friend of hers I've seen.

527
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,830
That's just them being blind.

528
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,100
I, Zhu Niannian,

529
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,430
am not like that.

530
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,550
You don't think

531
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,010
she has bad social skills, do you?

532
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,270
Not exactly.

533
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,140
If you ask me,

534
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,100
you just don't understand Chen Jing'an.

535
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,510
Why do you say that?

536
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:38,770
Then tell me,

537
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,760
what do you think of her?

538
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,050
Although she seems

539
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,180
like a tomboy,

540
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,680
rough around the edges,

541
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,800
she's actually thoughtful.

542
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,890
And she acts on impulse.

543
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,890
Once she's set on something,

544
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,140
no one can stop her.

545
00:24:58,970 --> 00:24:59,810
Wait...

546
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,890
are you praising her

547
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,140
or criticizing her?

548
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,760
I...I'm a little confused.

549
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:05,970
It's hard to say

550
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,100
if her personality is good or bad.

551
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,050
If she meets the right people,

552
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,470
of course it's good.

553
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,300
But if she misjudges someone,

554
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,760
it'll only hurt her in the end.

555
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,140
It's not that serious, is it?

556
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:23,180
I think Chen Jing'an has good judgment.

557
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,470
Good judgment?

558
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,390
You mean Li Minqiu?

559
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,390
I...

560
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,440
Well,

561
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,800
what happened?

562
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,370
I suspect they're dating.

563
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:35,300
No way.

564
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,230
I...

565
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,640
I promise you,

566
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:39,770
there's no way

567
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:42,100
she likes Li Minqiu.

568
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,260
How can you be so sure?

569
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,300
You know something?

570
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,310
I...

571
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,880
I don't know how to explain it,

572
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,970
but trust me on this.

573
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,260
Chen Jing'an would never

574
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,460
like Li Minqiu.

575
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,800
So it's Li Minqiu
having a one-sided crush.

576
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:58,720
Why can't you get this?

577
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,760
Then… what about Tian Ye?

578
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,070
Will they be together?

579
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:02,980
No way.

580
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,850
She's never seen him as a guy.

581
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,730
Exactly.

582
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:07,970
And Li Minqiu

583
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,510
is even less likely than Tian Ye.

584
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,930
That's for the best.

585
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,690
Zhu Niannian,

586
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,070
honestly, I'm really glad

587
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,720
you two became friends.

588
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,850
Our family is special.

589
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,050
Our parents are busy with work.

590
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,300
She basically grew up
with just me around.

591
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,510
She's been strong-willed

592
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,510
but also insecure.

593
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,050
Sometimes she's snappy,

594
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,300
especially to people close to her.

595
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,050
But she doesn't

596
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,480
hold a grudge.

597
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,640
Didn't expect you

598
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,350
to understand her so well.

599
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:56,930
Now you know her.

600
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,470
So if you ever argue with her,

601
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,010
don't take it to heart,

602
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:02,890
or hold it against her.

603
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:07,390
If you talked to her like this normally,

604
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,260
she won't get annoyed with you.

605
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,300
Did she complain about me?

606
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:14,770
No.

607
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:16,770
I could tell.

608
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,060
It's fine.

609
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,850
That is how we get along.

610
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,310
Chen Jing'an.

611
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,640
Tian Ye.

612
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,260
I gotta go, something came up.

613
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,560
Take it.

614
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,440
Where's Chen Jing'an?

615
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:43,940
Just left.

616
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,350
Oh no, I forgot it.

617
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,220
(Nancheng No.2 High School)

618
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,060
Chen Jing'an.

619
00:27:59,140 --> 00:27:59,980
Where's Niannian?

620
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,060
She hasn't come out.

621
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,500
Go to the milk tea shop.

622
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,350
I need to talk.

623
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,550
Is Chen Jing'an crazy?

624
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:22,890
Where's Changning?

625
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,420
That way.

626
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,270
What happened?

627
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,190
I wasn't finished.

628
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,390
Is Changning inside?

629
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,490
No.

630
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,350
I don't believe you.

631
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,680
You can't go over there.

632
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,470
Let me through.

633
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,310
Not your business.

634
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,390
You're not going.

635
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,510
Tian Ye! Tian Ye, open the door!

636
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,060
Coming!

637
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,350
Chen Changning,

638
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,550
Chen Jing'an and Li Minqiu

639
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,890
went to the milk tea shop.

640
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,430
About yesterday...

641
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,220
I know you didn't mean it.

642
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,010
I'm not upset about it.

643
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:10,800
So...

644
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:11,690
you don't need to

645
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,010
give me these snacks

646
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:16,040
or wait for me at the school gate.

647
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,920
My brother and my friends misunderstood.

648
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,780
They thought we were dating.

649
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,890
And Niannian said

650
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,220
she doesn't blame you,

651
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,930
so you don't need to

652
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:37,180
keep apologizing to me.

653
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,140
That's good.

654
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,390
She barely spoke to me.

655
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,140
I thought she was still mad.

656
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,190
Jing'an.

657
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,640
Niannian? Why are you here?

658
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,550
To watch someone catch a cheater.

659
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,390
Catch what?

660
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,060
Um...

661
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,260
Let me treat you to milk tea.

662
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,020
Great!

663
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,330
I'll have snow cap milk tea,

664
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,310
full sugar with bobas

665
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,670
and extra ice cream.
