1
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:08,625
Nian Nian

2
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:10,000
Let's go find Teacher Yu.

3
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,916
Instead of suspecting classmates, it's better to ask the teacher to check the surveillance footage.

4
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:13,375
Let's see what really happened.

5
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:15,291
Such an official suggestion.

6
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,166
It must be Chen Changning.

7
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:17,458
That model student must have told you, right?

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,500
Alright.

9
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:19,541
Shasha

10
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,375
You go back to the classroom first.

11
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:22,291
Jing'an and I will go to the teacher's office.

12
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,041
Okay, let's go.

13
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:29,375
Didn't we agree to have no secrets?

14
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:31,875
Why are you still not including me?

15
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:42,958
Excuse me.

16
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:44,500
You two are here.

17
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:45,208
What's the matter?

18
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:46,791
Teacher.

19
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,916
We still haven't found the Walkman.

20
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:50,750
We wanted to ask if you could help us.

21
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:51,958
Teacher.

22
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:53,041
Last night,

23
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:55,208
I really did put the Walkman in my backpack.

24
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:57,083
But I just can't find it today.

25
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,958
I suspect someone took it.

26
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:02,041
I understand.

27
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,208
Accusing someone of stealing

28
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,333
is not something you can say lightly.

29
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,833
I remember there's surveillance in the back.

30
00:02:08,207 --> 00:02:09,166
How about I find some time

31
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:10,750
to help you two check it out?

32
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:13,332
Thank you, Teacher.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,750
I brought this for you, eat it quickly.

34
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,332
You really don't have to do this, Nian Nian.

35
00:02:23,332 --> 00:02:25,582
No need to be polite with me, just eat.

36
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:27,125
These past few days,

37
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,957
you've looked so hungry that your complexion isn't good.

38
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,750
There's still PE class this afternoon.

39
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,582
It's easy to faint.

40
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:33,875
Thank you.

41
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,291
I'm really burning the candle at both ends right now.

42
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,582
Teacher Yu Min went to check the surveillance footage.

43
00:02:47,832 --> 00:02:49,875
If she tells me who did it,

44
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,332
how can I still be classmates with them?

45
00:02:53,832 --> 00:02:54,457
What if

46
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,332
What if that person ends up in my class again?

47
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,166
I would totally break down.

48
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,250
We'd keep running into each other all the time.

49
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:01,582
It would be so awkward.

50
00:03:03,332 --> 00:03:05,082
I believe the teacher will handle it well.

51
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,707
If I find out who did it,

52
00:03:09,707 --> 00:03:10,875
I definitely won't let them off.

53
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:12,916
What do you want to do?

54
00:03:13,457 --> 00:03:14,791
You could ask Li Minqiu for help.

55
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,207
Let him stand up for you.

56
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:16,916
Then in the future,

57
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:18,541
who would dare do something like this again?

58
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,332
I wouldn't go to him.

59
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,707
We have the big boss of No. 2 High School.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,416
Chen Jing'an is here.

61
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:26,541
Right, Chen Jing'an?

62
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,082
If I find out who it is,

63
00:03:29,082 --> 00:03:30,000
I'll ask them to meet me outside school.

64
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,082
And have you fight them.

65
00:03:31,457 --> 00:03:32,750
Let them see how tough you are.

66
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,416
Oh my god.

67
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,125
This is a bit too much.

68
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:46,375
I can't finish it either.

69
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,166
Sasha, let's eat together.

70
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,207
What do you mean?

71
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:52,791
Are you asking me to eat your leftovers?

72
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,500
Are you looking down on me?

73
00:03:57,957 --> 00:03:58,916
Then I'll go buy another portion.

74
00:03:58,916 --> 00:03:59,791
No need, thanks.

75
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:06,457
Shasha

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,541
Where is Jing'an?

77
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:08,457
She's just worried you aren't eating enough.

78
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:09,832
How about this,

79
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,000
if you want to eat anything else, just tell me.

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,582
I'll buy it for you.

81
00:04:11,957 --> 00:04:12,625
Do you want a drink?

82
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:13,875
No need, really.

83
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,125
I don't need your charity.

84
00:04:17,165 --> 00:04:17,833
Shasha

85
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,208
That's not what we meant.

86
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,208
You've misunderstood.

87
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,290
Lately,

88
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,915
you've been saving money all the time

89
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,000
and not eating.

90
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,750
We're worried you'll hurt your stomach.

91
00:04:27,665 --> 00:04:28,290
You guys...

92
00:04:30,415 --> 00:04:31,290
Chen Jing'an

93
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,208
I haven't known you for that long, have I?

94
00:04:33,665 --> 00:04:35,125
Why are you pretending to be so nice?

95
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,333
Shasha

96
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:38,583
Watch your mouth.

97
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,040
Chen Jing'an is just trying to care about you, but you take it the wrong way.

98
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:40,958
Yeah.

99
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,540
I just don't know what's good for me.

100
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,040
Everything's my fault, okay?

101
00:04:44,165 --> 00:04:45,750
Deng Shasha, what do you want from me?

102
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,333
Shasha, Nian Nian, let's talk this out calmly.

103
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,125
Zhu Nian Nian

104
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:51,625
Do you remember what you said yesterday?

105
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:52,750
You said

106
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,665
I'm your most important friend.

107
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,540
Yeah, that's right.

108
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,165
You are my most important friend.

109
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,040
And then what?

110
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,915
You only say it, but you don't mean it.

111
00:05:03,165 --> 00:05:05,208
Lately, you've been acting like a different person.

112
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,040
You're always hanging out with Chen Jing'an.

113
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,165
It's like you two have some secret.

114
00:05:09,165 --> 00:05:10,583
And you can't tell me about it.

115
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,540
If you don't want to be my friend,

116
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,458
then don't mess with me.

117
00:05:23,415 --> 00:05:25,165
You girls are so complicated.

118
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,250
Is it really such a problem to have one more person?

119
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:08,458
Here you are.

120
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:09,375
What's wrong?

121
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,958
You didn't bring your phone, did you?

122
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,415
No, I didn't.

123
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:13,250
My mom wouldn't let me bring it.

124
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,125
It's okay.

125
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,083
I'm telling you, she filmed that on purpose.

126
00:06:25,915 --> 00:06:26,750
The teacher's coming.

127
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:41,583
Tian Ye.

128
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,625
Are you asking for a beating by giving false information?

129
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,083
Exactly.

130
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,250
Come on, come on.

131
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,125
Let's fight.

132
00:06:58,665 --> 00:06:59,250
Nian Nian.

133
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,833
No matter what others say about you,

134
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,665
I'll always support you.

135
00:07:02,915 --> 00:07:04,125
Go back.

136
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,250
Why is everyone acting so weird today?

137
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,125
You're the school beauty.

138
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:12,458
They all...

139
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,208
They all like to look at you.

140
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,290
It's totally normal.

141
00:07:23,915 --> 00:07:24,333
Nian Nian.

142
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:25,500
What's going on?

143
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,250
Do you know who did it?

144
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:23,500
Li Minqiu

145
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,415
You brought your phone to school, huh?

146
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:32,958
Hand it over.

147
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,833
Have you all seen the forum?

148
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,208
It's all over the place.

149
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,416
Is there anyone who hasn't seen it?

150
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,416
What else can Zhu Niannian do besides pretending?

151
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,416
Acting like a diva at the rehearsal.

152
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:45,708
Making the teacher angry.

153
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,375
Can't even remember her lines.

154
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,083
And she still has the nerve to play Juliet.

155
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,666
The air today

156
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,250
feels different from before.

157
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:55,833
Did you notice?

158
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,750
The loyal sidekick isn't defending her anymore.

159
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,208
She got dumped, I guess.

160
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:01,583
Yeah.

161
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,166
Look at Chen Jing'an.

162
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,416
She's a great host and Chen Changning's sister.

163
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:06,208
Her family is well-off too.

164
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,416
She and Zhu Niannian are the same kind of people.

165
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,000
Zhu Niannian is actually smarter than anyone.

166
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:14,291
She knows how to take advantage of being close to the source.

167
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,041
Some people

168
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,583
no matter how good they are at matchmaking,

169
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,416
still can't compare to Chen Jing'an.

170
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:20,708
She's going to be the future sister-in-law.

171
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,416
If you keep talking nonsense,

172
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:23,458
I won't be polite to you.

173
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,041
Deng Shasha.

174
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,791
I just told the truth and you can't handle it.

175
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,041
Chen Jing'an, let go of me.

176
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,666
Come on, I dare you to hit me.

177
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,708
Forget it, Tingting, we're all classmates.

178
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:31,708
Xinyi, don't hold me back.

179
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:32,541
Ji Wenting.

180
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:33,750
Are you jealous of Zhu Niannian?

181
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,666
Is that why you spend all day talking bad about her?

182
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,833
Don't throw my Xiao Si.

183
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,208
Here, take it back.

184
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,541
Everyone, stop!

185
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,958
Do you want the teacher to come?

186
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:47,916
Stop making a scene.

187
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,166
Let me show you something.

188
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,625
Why did you bring your phone to school?

189
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,125
I want to show you this.

190
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,041
Everyone with a phone knows about it now.

191
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,791
I wonder who could be so heartless.

192
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,000
They're deliberately targeting our school beauty.

193
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,083
Phones aren't allowed at school.

194
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,000
The student council has the authority to handle this.

195
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,208
I'm also in the student council.

196
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,750
So I need to set an example.

197
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,166
I've been thinking about this all afternoon.

198
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:55,625
I want to contact the forum moderator.

199
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:56,791
And get this post deleted.

200
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,291
Has the moderator replied?

201
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,125
No, not yet.

202
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,708
Have you offended anyone recently?

203
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,333
It's not like I haven't offended people.

204
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,625
The name of the person who posted this is

205
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,750
Ban Cheng Feng Sha

206
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,958
She posted a lot of those slanderous posts.

207
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:12,750
What do you all think,

208
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,208
is she working with the person who took the Walkman?

209
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,500
Are they in it together?

210
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:17,875
Just trying to mess with Zhu Niannian.

211
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,000
I can understand posting things like that,

212
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,083
but what's the point of taking the Walkman?

213
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,833
It doesn't really make Niannian lose anything.

214
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:25,958
Is it really worth stealing something?

215
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,541
So are you still rehearsing in private?

216
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,458
No, I'm not.

217
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,500
Chen Jing'an is preparing to host now.

218
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
There's not much time left.

219
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:35,500
Don't worry.

220
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,791
If I really can't memorize it,

221
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,500
I'll just secretly bring it with me during the performance.

222
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,083
I'll listen to it while I act.

223
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,291
Let me help you rehearse.

224
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,500
We've known each other for so long, we have great chemistry.

225
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:46,916
It's really not necessary.

226
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,958
When did you start being so distant with me?

227
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,708
You used to come to me whenever you needed something.

228
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:51,708
I was always there with you.

229
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,708
But ever since Chen Jing'an came along,

230
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:55,708
you go to her for everything.

231
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,958
You never think of me anymore.

232
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,500
She and I are good friends.

233
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,500
Isn't it normal for me to ask her for help?

234
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,083
Yeah.

235
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,583
There's nothing wrong with you asking her.

236
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,208
You two are the ones who belong in the same world.

237
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:06,750
I'm just being petty.

238
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,750
I shouldn't be getting in between you two and causing trouble.

239
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:13,958
Could it be

240
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:14,958
Deng Shasha

241
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,041
Who

242
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,000
Hello, everyone

243
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,750
The student council would like to remind everyone

244
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,041
Please be sure to follow school rules while on campus

245
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:23,458
While on campus

246
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,166
It is not allowed to have mobile phones at school

247
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,958
The student council will be increasing inspections soon

248
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,208
Please follow the school rules

249
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,458
If a mobile phone is found

250
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,791
It will be confiscated and handed over to your parents

251
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,458
And you will receive a verbal warning

252
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:36,583
Thank you for your cooperation

253
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:38,333
Listen to that

254
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,291
Chen Changning is starting to give orders

255
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,583
Mobile phones are now banned

256
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,791
Is that his order? That's a school rule

257
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,333
Where is Li Minqiu?

258
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:49,416
It's good that she's not here.

259
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,083
Don't you think

260
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,625
that recently Chen Changning and you—

261
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:55,583
the fake Zhu Niannian—

262
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:56,750
have been getting really close?

263
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,541
Does he like Zhu Niannian?

264
00:12:58,541 --> 00:12:59,458
Absolutely not.

265
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,666
Niannian is just pretending to be his sister every day.

266
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:03,875
It's normal for him to help her.

267
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:05,708
Wrong.

268
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,166
Completely wrong.

269
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:08,875
As for Chen Changning,

270
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,333
he doesn't know about you two switching places.

271
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,083
Right now, you are Zhu Niannian,

272
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,166
the one everyone at school is talking about.

273
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:15,250
Not Chen Jing'an.

274
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,500
You get the logic, right?

275
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,166
Now Chen Changning is holding a megaphone,

276
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,291
and the person he wants to protect

277
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,750
isn't you, Chen Jing'an,

278
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,666
but this body you're in,

279
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:24,500
the real owner,

280
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:25,500
Zhu Niannian.

281
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,083
So do you think

282
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,041
Chen Changning likes

283
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:29,833
Zhu Niannian?

284
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,583
It's new.

285
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:33,916
Chen Jing'an, where are you going?

286
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:34,458
Don't follow me.

287
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,416
I'm going to find Deng Shasha and get to the bottom of this.

288
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,000
Deng Shasha

289
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:56,791
Li Minqiu

290
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:58,458
What's wrong?

291
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,500
Why did you try to hurt Zhu Niannian?

292
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,708
Aren't you two good friends?

293
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,875
Does what you did live up to the word "friend"?

294
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,583
What do you mean, hurt Niannian?

295
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,416
I don't understand what you mean.

296
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,333
You're still pretending, huh?

297
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,041
Fine.

298
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:12,333
Then let me ask you,

299
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,083
the prank photos of Niannian posted in the forum,

300
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:15,458
were you the one who posted them?

301
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,625
What makes you think I posted them?

302
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,000
Do I have any reason to do that?

303
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,291
The poster's nickname at the end

304
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:23,875
has the character "Sha" in it.

305
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,541
And you also went to watch Niannian's rehearsal.

306
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,541
How could it be me?

307
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:28,750
Would I be so stupid

308
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,541
as to do something like that

309
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:30,875
and even leave my own name?

310
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,916
Your suspicion is really ridiculous.

311
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,625
How could I possibly hurt Niannian?

312
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,333
If it wasn't you, who else could it be?

313
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,125
Let me tell you, Deng Shasha,

314
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:39,875
I don't hit women,

315
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,250
but if you hurt Niannian,

316
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,041
I definitely won't go easy on you.

317
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:44,916
Li Minqiu

318
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,083
What are you doing?

319
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,250
If you don't have any evidence,

320
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,333
don't make random accusations.

321
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,291
Shasha wouldn't do something like that.

322
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,208
Chen Jing'an, why are you defending her?

323
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,875
Niannian already guessed it was her.

324
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,458
How could Niannian say something like that?

325
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:56,750
I'm done talking to you.

326
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:58,333
Shasha

327
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,291
Li Minqiu

328
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:01,875
Why did you come here?

329
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:02,500
Nian Nian

330
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,750
I'll stand up for you.

331
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:04,958
This has nothing to do with you.

332
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,125
You should go back.

333
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,791
I can handle my own problems.

334
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:12,375
Let's go, Nian Nian.

335
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:16,708
Shasha

336
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,583
Don't mind what Li Minqiu said.

337
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,416
I believe you.

338
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:20,458
Nian Nian

339
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,750
You believe Shasha too, right?

340
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:25,541
I...

341
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,541
Anyway, it wasn't me.

342
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,333
Believe it or not.

343
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,083
Isn't this the Walkman I lost before?

344
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:42,958
Why do you have it?

345
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:44,458
I don't know.

346
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:46,625
Nian Nian

347
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:47,916
Did you really steal it?

348
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,250
You don't believe me.

349
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,208
I used to trust you.

350
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,875
But then this thing showed up here.

351
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,208
And in the username of that person on the forum,

352
00:15:59,208 --> 00:15:59,958
your name is there too.

353
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,166
How am I supposed to believe you now?

354
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,833
You think I did all of this?

355
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,083
Otherwise, how could everything be such a coincidence?

356
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,000
Calm down.

357
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,708
Maybe it wasn't Shasha.

358
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:12,791
Yeah.

359
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,750
You're right.

360
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,125
I did all of this.

361
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,333
Why would you do this?

362
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:17,041
Just because

363
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,625
I became friends with Chen Jing'an and ignored you,

364
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:19,958
you have to treat me like this?

365
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:21,291
Yes.

366
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,083
Think whatever you want.

367
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,125
If you think I hurt you,

368
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,875
then let's not be friends anymore.

369
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,458
You think I don't dare to cut ties with you, right?

370
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:34,875
Anyway, now

371
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:36,500
Zhu Niannian,

372
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,166
don't go too far.

373
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,666
Even if Shasha did this, so what?

374
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,125
You can't stop people from talking

375
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,625
just because you didn't do well in rehearsal.

376
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,791
It's just a Walkman.

377
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,791
You're so close with Shasha,

378
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,291
if she wants it, just give it to her.

379
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,041
Shut up.

380
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:53,166
None of your business.

381
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,083
It really has nothing to do with me.

382
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,458
But I just can't stand

383
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:57,916
you all ganging up on someone.

384
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,208
I have nothing to say.

385
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,500
If you think it's me, then so be it.

386
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,875
This must be a misunderstanding.

387
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,000
Shasha, why don't you explain yourself?

388
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,041
I believe you're not that kind of person.

389
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:17,833
I don't need your trust.

390
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,333
Stop pretending to be a good person here.

391
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:21,916
Nian Nian.

392
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,666
Let's go talk to Shasha and clear things up.

393
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,416
She definitely didn't do this.

394
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,583
Stop deceiving yourself.

395
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,166
Didn't she just admit it was her?

396
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,166
And to think I used to consider her a friend.

397
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:34,833
Anyway, now

398
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:35,833
the Walkman has been found.

399
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,250
I didn't lose anything.

400
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,375
Do whatever you want.

401
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,291
I really don't get it.

402
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,750
I didn't expect Deng Shasha to be so heartless.

403
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,500
And to think I treated her like a sister.

404
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,208
Calm down first.

405
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,125
Maybe she has her own reasons she can't talk about.

406
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,583
What kind of reason could she possibly have?

407
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,666
She probably just feels

408
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:26,750
like she's being left out.

409
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,458
I really don't understand.

410
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,250
We're all adults now.

411
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,791
Why act like we're in kindergarten?

412
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,166
Why fight over friends?

413
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:34,833
Can't we all just hang out together?

414
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,500
You're used to being carefree.

415
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,166
Of course you don't get how girls think.

416
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,333
Maybe this is just how girls' friendships are.

417
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,666
I don't really get girls—

418
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,166
I mean,

419
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,250
it's hard to figure out what girls are thinking.

420
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:51,916
Maybe sometimes even you girls

421
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,291
don't really understand yourselves.

422
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,458
How does he know

423
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,541
that I don't get how girls think?

424
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:16,750
What do you think about this?

425
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,250
Do you really think it was Deng Shasha?

426
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:19,833
It wasn't her.

427
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,541
Even though there's no solid evidence,

428
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:23,625
and no reason,

429
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,125
I still believe it definitely wasn't Shasha.

430
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,208
Shasha isn't a bad person.

431
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,666
She couldn't possibly do anything to hurt me.

432
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,250
Do you also think Deng Shasha did it?

433
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,083
I don't know.

434
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,416
But since you choose to trust her,

435
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,250
you should go and ask her directly.

436
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:43,875
Give her a chance to clear her name.

437
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,375
Thank you.

438
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,750
I'll go talk to Shasha and get to the bottom of this.

439
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,125
I hate it.

440
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,583
I hate you.

441
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,125
I hate you.

442
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,916
I'm really so angry.

443
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,083
From now on, with Deng Shasha,

444
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,583
I really can't be friends anymore.

445
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:39,458
I firmly believe

446
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,375
it definitely wasn't Deng Shasha who did it.

447
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,541
Shasha and I have been friends since the first year of high school.

448
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,000
She has always been especially nice to me.

449
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,833
There must be some misunderstanding here.

450
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,375
Let's find a time

451
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,791
to have a good talk together.

452
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,250
Let's clear up the misunderstanding.

453
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,458
Zhu Niannian,

454
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,083
please don't take sides without reason

455
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,041
with Deng Shasha, okay?

456
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,333
She used to be your best friend,

457
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:02,625
but does that mean now

458
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,541
I have to put up with her doing bad things?

459
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:08,333
An'an,

460
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,458
I'm not taking her side.

461
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,750
Everyone, please take a look at this question.

462
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:28,625
Cultural development

463
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,583
is like a surging, unceasing river.

464
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,875
To keep this river flowing smoothly,

465
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:33,833
and its water clear and beautiful,

466
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:37,416
we must maintain its channels and currents.

467
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,708
For cultural innovation,

468
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,000
this means

469
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,291
properly handling

470
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:43,541
contemporary culture

471
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,583
and traditional culture,

472
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,666
as well as the relationship between national and foreign cultures.

473
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:50,583
Alright.

474
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:51,541
Class dismissed.

475
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:52,583
Stand up.

476
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:56,125
Goodbye, teacher.

477
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:57,458
Goodbye, everyone.

478
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:58,875
Class monitor, please collect the homework.

479
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,625
Okay.

480
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,083
Right now, the forum is full of discussions.

481
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:50,916
About Zhu Niannian.

482
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:52,500
What's the use of being good-looking?

483
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,208
She looks so ugly in that photo.

484
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,333
And she still has the nerve to cry.

485
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:00,375
She stole someone’s Walkman and acts like she’s the victim.

486
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:01,916
Don’t talk nonsense.

487
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:04,375
How could Shasha be that kind of person?

488
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:05,708
Shasha.

489
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,750
Ji Wenting just likes to talk nonsense.

490
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:09,625
But she doesn’t mean any harm.

491
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:11,500
Don’t take it to heart.

492
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:13,583
Actually,

493
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:15,750
I’ve always thought you’re a good person too.

494
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:16,916
It’s just that

495
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:18,458
you always side with Zhu Niannian

496
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,208
and team up with her against me.

497
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:22,875
So I didn’t dare tell you these things.

498
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,708
But what happened yesterday,

499
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:26,541
I really couldn’t stand it anymore.

500
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,750
You and Niannian are such good friends.

501
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:31,833
How could she not even trust you?

502
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:32,583
That’s just too much.

503
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:35,333
What’s it got to do with you?

504
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:38,166
I’m just standing up for you.

505
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:39,291
Shasha.

506
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:42,083
Haven’t you realized what kind of person Niannian is?

507
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:42,958
Before,

508
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:45,625
you were the only one who foolishly thought she was nice.

509
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:46,750
Look,

510
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,166
now she’s clinging to Chen Jing’an.

511
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:49,833
She doesn’t care about you anymore.

512
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,750
Don't be too upset.

513
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:56,666
It's really not worth it.

514
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:58,833
You should just be happy.

515
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,083
Let her know

516
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:00,958
that without you,

517
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:02,208
it's her loss.

518
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:05,541
Thank you for comforting me.

519
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,250
We're all classmates, after all.

520
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:10,041
Want to have lunch together at noon?

521
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:12,958
But...

522
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:15,416
I used to talk bad about you.

523
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:16,625
Why do you...

524
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:18,791
Back then, you just didn't know me.

525
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,541
I'm not that petty to hold a grudge.

526
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:22,000
Then it's settled.

527
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:23,083
At noon,

528
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:24,750
let's have lunch together.

529
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,125
Chen Changning,

530
00:24:58,125 --> 00:24:59,208
look, isn't that Deng Shasha?

531
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:00,333
Since when did she

532
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,000
start hanging out with Liu Xinyi?

533
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:09,916
This Deng Shasha

534
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:11,458
has finally shown her true colors.

535
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:13,458
She actually sided with Liu Xinyi.

536
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,916
You really never know what's in someone's heart.

537
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:18,000
Chen Jing'an,

538
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:19,750
I still believe the Walkman

539
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,541
wasn't taken by Shasha.

540
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:21,958
There must be some misunderstanding.

541
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:23,250
On her birthday before,

542
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,458
she wouldn't even accept expensive gifts from me.

543
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:27,250
How could she possibly steal something?

544
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:29,250
Look at the situation now,

545
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,583
and you're still speaking up for her.

546
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:32,750
You can't just defend her

547
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,958
because she was nice to you before.

548
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:36,791
That Walkman from yesterday

549
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:38,791
really did fall from her desk, right?

550
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,750
She admitted it herself, didn't she?

551
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:42,166
Besides,

552
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,875
She’s always wanted a Walkman.

553
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,083
The motive is so obvious.

554
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:47,291
Why are you still convinced she didn’t do it?

555
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:49,000
She was just speaking out of anger.

556
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:51,041
It’s because you don’t trust her.

557
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:52,750
That’s why she said those things.

558
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:54,333
What kind of logic is that?

559
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:56,041
I don’t trust her.

560
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:58,041
I don’t trust her.

561
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:00,291
Shouldn’t she explain herself so I can trust her?

562
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,833
But she didn’t say anything.

563
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:03,541
That proves she must have done it.

564
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,791
There must be some misunderstanding.

565
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:08,583
Even though Sasha’s family isn’t well off,

566
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:11,375
she gets everything she has by herself.

567
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:13,208
Misunderstanding, misunderstanding, misunderstanding.

568
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:16,625
I’m standing up for you right now.

569
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:18,500
But you keep saying it’s a misunderstanding.

570
00:26:18,916 --> 00:26:20,500
So I’m the one being overly sentimental, huh?

571
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:22,125
I guess I deserve to be upset, then.

572
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,500
Anyway, she didn’t betray me.

573
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:25,666
I didn’t lose anything.

574
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:26,833
You guys...

575
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:28,083
Do whatever you want.

576
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:50,083
Alright, class.

577
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:51,458
Let’s look at this problem.

578
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:54,375
Last time on the test,

579
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:56,041
most of you got this question wrong.

580
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:58,833
I’ve written part of the answer first.

581
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:04,583
Let’s label the three yellow ping pong balls as A, B, and C.

582
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,875
Label the three white ping pong balls as 1, 2, and 3.

583
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:12,083
Randomly pick three balls from the six as the basic event.

584
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:43,791
What are you laughing at?

585
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,750
A13

586
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:12,416
Drawing things like this in class

587
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,500
What were you thinking?

588
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:23,500
Class dismissed.

589
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:39,416
Chen Jing'an

590
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:41,166
What's wrong?

591
00:28:41,916 --> 00:28:42,583
Is something the matter?

592
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,041
Teacher

593
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:46,500
I want to ask something.

594
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,500
You said you'd check the surveillance about yesterday.

595
00:28:48,708 --> 00:28:50,333
Is there any result now?

596
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:58,125
Did you find the person who stole the Walkman?

597
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:02,791
Who was it?

598
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:08,500
Chen Jing'an

599
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:10,791
Let me explain.

600
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,000
Well,

601
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:13,916
about this matter,

602
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:16,458
it's not a small issue, but it's not exactly huge either.

603
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,208
For the sake of that student,

604
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,125
I can't tell you who it is for now.

605
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,208
But you have to trust me.

606
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:25,916
Give me a little more time.

607
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,500
I will definitely give you

608
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,416
a proper explanation.

609
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:29,125
Alright?

610
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:31,708
Teacher Yu

611
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:32,666
Actually,

612
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:34,416
I just wanted to ask,

613
00:29:35,291 --> 00:29:36,125
that person,

614
00:29:36,791 --> 00:29:38,333
is it Deng Shasha?

615
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:40,833
It's not her.

616
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:42,000
It's not her.

617
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:43,458
That's good.

618
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:44,375
Thank you, teacher.

619
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:46,916
Then I'll go now, thank you.

620
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:50,916
It's really hot today.

621
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:17,291
Liu Xinyi

622
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:21,833
Thanks.

623
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:25,000
Xinyi.

624
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:27,083
Chen Changning knows your name.

625
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:28,166
Maybe.

626
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:29,708
He must've heard it at some point.

627
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:31,375
Maybe he's interested in you.

628
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:32,666
Maybe he's secretly paying attention to you.

629
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:33,833
Don't talk nonsense.

630
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,458
Let's go.

631
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:41,583
I was just looking for you.

632
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,416
Why were you looking for me?

633
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,750
I just asked Teacher Yu about checking the surveillance footage.

634
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:47,875
What does that have to do with me?

635
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:50,208
Teacher Yu said it wasn't Shasha.

636
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:53,250
It wasn't her.

637
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,666
I have no reason to lie to you about this.

638
00:30:58,166 --> 00:30:59,958
Although Teacher Yu didn't tell me who it was,

639
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,458
she's sure it wasn't Shasha.

640
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:02,791
We really misunderstood her.

641
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:03,625
Then...

642
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:06,250
Why didn't she explain earlier?

643
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:09,875
Because in her eyes,

644
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:11,958
the person who misunderstood her is her best friend.

645
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,083
I really don't get it.

646
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:15,875
You girls...

647
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:16,958
always say one thing and mean another.

648
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,041
If she had explained earlier,

649
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:19,416
none of this would've happened.

650
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:23,166
Because she knew

651
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:24,416
you wouldn't believe her.

652
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,250
So explaining wouldn't help.

653
00:31:28,791 --> 00:31:30,416
Why is everything so complicated?

654
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:40,083
What's wrong?

655
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:41,708
You've been scratching for a whole class.

656
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,791
My scalp is itchy.

657
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:46,208
You're the one with an itchy scalp.

658
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:53,208
About that thing with the Walkman before,

659
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:54,875
I think I really misunderstood Deng Shasha.

660
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:56,458
If it were you,

661
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:57,500
what would you do?

662
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,458
I’d definitely point at your nose and yell at you.

663
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:02,041
And then

664
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:03,166
I’d cut ties with you.

665
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,500
Me?

666
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:06,041
Watch your image.

667
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:14,583
I was just kidding.

668
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,875
But if it were me,

669
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:21,125
I might even feel like dying.

670
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:23,875
After all, we’ve known each other for so long.

671
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:26,625
Even if everyone else misunderstood me,

672
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:28,125
I’d still believe

673
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,333
that you would trust me unconditionally.

674
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:33,958
But if you really did misunderstand me,

675
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:39,750
I wouldn’t let you off even as a ghost.

676
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:43,250
What if

677
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,916
you’re not a ghost?

678
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:46,625
What would you do?

679
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:50,791
If you

680
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,500
cried and begged,

681
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:53,875
tried to please me,

682
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,583
apologized,

683
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:56,875
and admitted you were wrong,

684
00:32:58,041 --> 00:32:59,666
I might consider forgiving you.

685
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,541
Be serious, will you?

686
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:05,666
Why are you hitting me?

687
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,791
Be a bit more serious.

688
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:09,916
I think

689
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:11,458
if you’ve never argued

690
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:12,750
or had misunderstandings,

691
00:33:12,916 --> 00:33:13,833
you’re not real friends.

692
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:16,041
The key is,

693
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:17,250
after you’ve argued,

694
00:33:17,958 --> 00:33:18,541
you have to

695
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:19,958
reflect on your own mistakes

696
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:22,333
and honestly face the misunderstanding.

697
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,416
That’s how friendship lasts forever.

698
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,041
Did you forget

699
00:33:31,666 --> 00:33:32,833
how the two of us made it through back then?

700
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,083
If we hadn't argued so much back then,

701
00:33:35,666 --> 00:33:36,958
would we have the relationship we do now?

702
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:39,458
I don't even want to mention what happened to you.

703
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:40,291
Let me tell you,

704
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,375
I'm not really Zhu Niannian.

705
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:54,083
You can't blame me entirely for not trusting you.

706
00:33:58,416 --> 00:33:59,541
About the student council transition,

707
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:00,750
are you still handling it or not?

708
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:02,541
You just come here and sit to read.

709
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:03,916
So why do you even come here?

710
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:08,791
Come in.

711
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:11,166
Junior.

712
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:12,083
Do you need something?

713
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:13,708
Teacher Shi said

714
00:34:13,708 --> 00:34:15,375
it's the recommendation form for the speech contest.

715
00:34:15,541 --> 00:34:16,666
It's with the student council.

716
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:18,333
She asked me to come get it.

717
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:20,291
I remember.

718
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:21,125
Let me find it for you.

719
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:24,583
You're the one who won first place in our school's speech contest.

720
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:26,916
Yes.

721
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:28,000
That's me.

722
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:30,208
I've heard the teachers talk about you.

723
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:32,083
You've always performed excellently.

724
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:33,500
Your grades are also very good.

725
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:34,500
Senior.

726
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:35,458
You know me?

727
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,625
This time, going to the city for the competition,

728
00:34:37,916 --> 00:34:38,958
the opponents will be tougher.

729
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,458
You need to prepare well.

730
00:34:40,666 --> 00:34:41,208
Don't be nervous.

731
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:43,208
I'll definitely do my best.

732
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:44,708
But

733
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,458
I think my speech

734
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,458
still needs some adjustments.

735
00:34:48,708 --> 00:34:50,166
If you have time,

736
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,375
could you help me take a look?

737
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:54,000
Sure.

738
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:55,583
I'm free after school.

739
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:57,875
It's settled then.

740
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:01,500
Here.

741
