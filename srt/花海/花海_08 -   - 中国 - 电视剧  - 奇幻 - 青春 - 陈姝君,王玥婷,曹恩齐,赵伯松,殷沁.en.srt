3
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,300
Zhu Niannian,

4
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,840
you're moved

5
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,870
to our class?

6
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,150
Yeah.

7
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,020
Tian Ye,

8
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,440
from now on, we're desk mates.

9
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,540
Let's go to the bathroom.

10
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,290
I just came here.

11
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,620
I thought you were Deng Shasha.

12
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,550
Sorry.

13
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,540
She scared me to death.

14
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,140
Tian Ye.

15
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,160
Switch desks with me.

16
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,170
No way.

17
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,120
My desk mate is the Chinese class rep.

18
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,540
You can copy her Chinese homework.

19
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,500
Besides,

20
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,220
isn't Chinese your worst subject?

21
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,090
You remembered wrong.

22
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,160
Physics is my worst,

23
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,640
and I can copy from the campus belle.

24
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,250
Tian Ye.

25
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,000
Switch seats with me.

26
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,240
I'll do your physics homework

27
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,530
from now on.

28
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,000
Don't think I don't know

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,080
what you two are planning.

30
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,410
With your crooked looks,

31
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,850
would the campus belle like you?

32
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,210
She wouldn't like you either.

33
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,040
Your counterattack

34
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,870
has no effect on Tian Ye at all.

35
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,160
Tian Ye.

36
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,250
Just agree.

37
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,620
Tian Ye.

38
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,460
I lost.

39
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,160
Just agree.

40
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,730
Tian Ye.

41
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,120
What are you doing?

42
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,040
Nothing, nothing.

43
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,210
Nothing at all.

44
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,910
(After a few days,)

45
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,750
(why has our relationship
become like this?)

46
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,710
Report.

47
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,120
Niannian, you're here.

48
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,250
Niannian, your sudden switch

49
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,010
caught me off guard.

50
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,860
I don't know if it was
an impulsive decision

51
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,780
or if you have some other reason,

52
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,870
but I still want
to try to keep you here.

53
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:23,670
Ms. Yu,

54
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,960
I've already moved to Class 1.

55
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,960
I know you have,

56
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,370
but I still want
to leave you a way back.

57
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,460
Think about it.

58
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,750
The joint exam is coming.

59
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,870
You didn't do well in science before.

60
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,620
It'll be hard to get a good score.

61
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,380
I think you should think carefully again

62
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,380
before the exams.

63
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,210
Class 8 will always welcome you back.

64
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,800
Ms. Yu, don't worry.

65
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,910
I won't regret it.

66
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,750
I'll take science

67
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,500
very seriously.

68
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,410
You don't need to worry.

69
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,050
Stand up.

70
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,150
Hello, Ms. Yu.

71
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,500
Hello, everyone.

72
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,660
I've finished grading

73
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,000
this pop quiz.

74
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,830
Overall, everyone has improved.

75
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,770
But

76
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,120
only one student

77
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,870
got a perfect score.

78
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,370
It must be you.

79
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,500
Zhu Niannian is gone.

80
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,000
You're the best in history here.

81
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,250
It's

82
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,210
Chen Jing'an.

83
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,880
Let's give her a round of applause.

84
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,080
Actually, Chen Jing'an,

85
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,250
when you just came here,

86
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,290
I was really worried

87
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,830
that you wouldn't be able to keep up.

88
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,540
But now, I see there's no need to worry.

89
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,410
I can only say Chen Jing'an

90
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,120
is a natural at liberal arts.

91
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,210
Come on.

92
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:51,750
Congratulations.

93
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,660
Thanks, Ms. Yu.

94
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,080
I'll keep working hard.

95
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,420
Go back to your seat.

96
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,380
Whose is this?

97
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,580
I bought too much.

98
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,950
It'd be a waste not to finish.

99
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,750
If you don't mind...

100
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't mind.

101
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,160
It worked?

102
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,370
That's so fancy.

103
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,900
You're not going
to snitch to the teacher, right?

104
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,160
What are you saying?

105
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,000
How did you learn to act

106
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,830
just like Chen Jing'an?

107
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,880
Here.

108
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,120
(This campus belle treatment
is just too good.)

109
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:13,750
Shasha.

110
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,090
Shasha,

111
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,370
from now on, we're classmates.

112
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,080
Do you want some water?

113
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,250
No.

114
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,710
Before Niannian left, she told me

115
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,940
you're her best friend.

116
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,010
She wants us to get along too.

117
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,800
Really?

118
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:36,750
Yeah.

119
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,830
I just don't get it.

120
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,540
Why would she suddenly

121
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,960
switch majors?

122
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,350
I asked her, but she wouldn't say.

123
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,720
Maybe she just

124
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,080
doesn't want
to study liberal arts anymore.

125
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,130
Look.

126
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,620
Plenty of students

127
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,910
change their majors in Grade 11.

128
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,290
I don't think it's that simple.

129
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,250
Lately, it seems

130
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,160
she's been hiding something.

131
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,000
Something's off.

132
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,750
Don't overthink it.

133
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,040
She's fine.

134
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,160
I'm her best friend.

135
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,710
I know her better than you.

136
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,210
At home,

137
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,290
how do you get along
with Chen Changning?

138
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,960
Just like normal.

139
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,080
What's he like at home?

140
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,640
Is he different from how he is outside?

141
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,000
Let's not talk about Chen Changning.

142
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,260
Let's talk about something else.

143
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,790
One last question.

144
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,540
Does he like any girl?

145
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,910
Probably not.

146
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,130
No?

147
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,500
Great.

148
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,500
Good resources should go to ourselves.

149
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,500
I think Niannian and Chen Changning

150
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,370
are a good match.

151
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,250
What do you think?

152
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,960
Let's do a good deed

153
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,460
and play matchmakers.

154
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,040
They're both great.

155
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,920
It'd be a shame
if they don't end up together.

156
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,080
Keep your voice down.

157
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,710
Don't let others hear it.

158
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,580
Then it's settled.

159
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,000
You're Chen Changning's sister

160
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,120
and Niannian's friend.

161
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,160
You'll have plenty of chances.

162
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,960
Deal, okay?

163
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,460
Niannian,

164
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,620
you told Chen Jing'an
you were worried about me?

165
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,830
Chen Jing'an already told me.

166
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,160
We're getting along pretty well.

167
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:42,250
Niannian,

168
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:44,410
it's Chen Changning.

169
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,550
Childish.

170
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,790
I heard from Chen Jing'an

171
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,510
that you're moved to the physics class.

172
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,800
How are you doing?

173
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,500
It's okay.

174
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
(Chen Jing'an)

175
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,460
(is really something.)

176
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,410
(She actually helped Niannian
and Chen Changning.)

177
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,060
I heard from Chen Jing'an

178
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,410
that you've helped her a lot.

179
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,580
If you ever have any trouble at school

180
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,210
or need help with something,

181
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,370
you can always tell me.

182
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,040
Chen Changning,

183
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,830
Niannian

184
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,910
switched from liberal arts to science.

185
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,500
Although she's working very hard,

186
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,620
her foundation in physics,

187
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:39,120
chemistry, and biology
is still a bit weak.

188
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,830
If you have time,

189
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,750
could you

190
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,870
tutor her?

191
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,830
(Deng Shasha, what are you doing?)

192
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,770
(With my grades,
I don't need him to tutor me.)

193
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,840
(Niannian,)

194
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,120
(now's not the time to act reserved.)

195
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,010
(This is)

196
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:55,910
(a chance to be alone)

197
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,750
(and build feelings.)

198
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,120
(You can't miss it.)

199
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,910
(Never mind,
Chen Changning won't agree anyway.)

200
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,380
Changning,

201
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,580
just think about it.

202
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,840
Sure.

203
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,830
It depends on when Zhu Niannian

204
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,460
has time.

205
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,120
(This Chen Changning must be fake.)

206
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,630
Changning, here's the thing.

207
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,330
Niannian's family

208
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,750
is pretty strict.

209
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,280
If she wants to go out,

210
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,930
she has to tell her parents in advance.

211
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,000
So why don't we

212
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,960
set a time

213
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,410
after she's sure?

214
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,630
Alright.

215
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,670
Alright.

216
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,520
Niannian, don't you think

217
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,890
Chen Changning might like you too?

218
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,830
Otherwise, why would he talk to you?

219
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,620
But next time, you can't

220
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,620
be too reserved.

221
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,660
What if he misunderstands

222
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,720
and thinks you don't want

223
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,560
to talk to him?

224
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,290
What nonsense are you spouting?

225
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,030
I'm being serious.

226
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,520
From my intuition,

227
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,000
he definitely likes you.

228
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,290
Impossible.

229
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,520
Niannian, be more confident.

230
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,290
You're so outstanding.

231
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,540
You're beautiful

232
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,410
and gentle,

233
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,580
and you have good grades.

234
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,910
If he gets to know you,

235
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,330
he's bound to like you.

236
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,330
Niannian, don't be shy.

237
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,340
Changning's here.

238
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,300
Come on.

239
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:31,750
You asked me before

240
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,960
about memory exchange, right?

241
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,540
I gathered some info.

242
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,050
Take a look.

243
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,250
Four-Joy Meatballs?

244
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,210
Right.

245
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,040
These are all sci-fi concepts

246
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,080
I compiled

247
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,910
from Four-Joy Meatballs' novels.

248
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,420
I think

249
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,790
some of the theories

250
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,410
are related to memory exchange.

251
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,830
Maybe they can inspire you.

252
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,040
Though sci-fi novels are fictional,

253
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,160
the knowledge in them

254
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,500
is solid.

255
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,700
If you don't believe me,

256
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,580
you can go and read
Four-Joy Meatballs' books

257
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,660
and study them carefully.

258
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,210
Also,

259
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,910
I recommend a few movies.

260
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,250
They're all listed here.

261
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,670
Mr. Deng,

262
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,570
you're not Four-Joy Meatballs,

263
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,160
are you?

264
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,090
Sorry.

265
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,330
I'm here to return the books to Ms. Fan.

266
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,710
Alright.

267
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,750
Mr. Deng,

268
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,210
please tell her later

269
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,090
that I left it here.

270
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,540
Sure, no problem.

271
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,870
By the way, Mr. Deng,

272
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,130
are you

273
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,710
really Four-Joy Meatballs?

274
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,460
Ms. Yu,

275
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,620
have you read my books?

276
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,290
I've heard a little.

277
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,130
See?

278
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,170
Even the history teacher

279
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,620
has read my sci-fi novels.

280
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,080
During the break,

281
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,450
you should read them carefully.

282
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,710
They'll definitely help your studies.

283
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,380
Alright.

284
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,000
Chen Jing'an, good for you.

285
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,540
From now on, you're my best friend

286
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,840
besides Niannian.

287
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,160
Did something good happen to you?

288
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,210
Something amazing.

289
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,790
Thanks this time.

290
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,880
Talk to you later.

291
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,120
The joint exam is coming.

292
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,370
I'm going to study.

293
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:25,510
(Joint exam countdown: 1 day)

294
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,220
(Grade 11)

295
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,830
Put away all the books on your desk.

296
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,700
If there's no space,
leave them in my office.

297
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,710
Come on.

298
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,640
Hurry.

299
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,050
(Joint exam countdown: 1 day)

300
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,300
(Grade 11)

301
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,800
(Exam Room 16, Nancheng No. 2
High School Joint Exam Center)

302
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,710
Niannian, do you need my help?

303
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,700
No.

304
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,750
I'm strong.

305
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,590
It's fine.

306
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,210
Come here.

307
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,580
Go back to your seat.

308
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,170
Jing'an...

309
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,250
The exam is over.

310
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,080
Please stop writing immediately.

311
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,170
Zheng Chuan.

312
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:29,910
Come to my place later to watch a movie.

313
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,110
Let's invite Chen Jing'an too.

314
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,840
Sure, after three days of exams,

315
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,000
we can finally relax.

316
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,500
Any new resources?

317
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,590
Yeah.

318
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,800
From Japan.

319
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:49,710
Japanese?

320
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,000
What kind of stuff?

321
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,160
You wouldn't like it.

322
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,210
Not suitable for you.

323
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,370
Let's go find Chen Jing'an.

324
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,210
Okay.

325
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,190
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

326
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,330
(I'm the real Chen Jing'an.)

327
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,960
(You won't show me good stuff?)

328
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,430
(Grade 12)

329
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,410
How did your exam go?

330
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,870
Zhang Fenglai from Class 2 said

331
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:18,870
he'd beat you this time.

332
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,130
It's okay.

333
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,330
The English reading
was beyond the syllabus.

334
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,000
There were many rare words
I hadn't seen before.

335
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,610
The average score
probably won't be too high.

336
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,900
The aerospace article?

337
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,080
America reported new achievements
last year.

338
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,790
It was an excerpt
from a magazine article.

339
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:37,650
I've read it.

340
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:38,830
No way.

341
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,540
You've read it?

342
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,160
My aunt sent me the magazine.

343
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,420
I just glanced at it.

344
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,500
Big shot,

345
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,420
let me see it too.

346
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,200
I want to know how much I scored.

347
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:49,710
No time.

348
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,210
Where are you going?

349
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:53,960
Something to do.

350
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,230
(You're all doomed.)

351
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,140
(The resurrection of S)

352
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,210
Tian Ye,

353
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,540
the Korean movie last time was boring.

354
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,350
This one's gotta be more exciting.

355
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,630
Don't worry.

356
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,750
The thrilling part's coming.

357
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,620
Just watch.
The exciting part's about to start.

358
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,620
Stop pretending.

359
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,420
Zheng Chuan!

360
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,750
Can we not watch horror movies?

361
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:44,750
Don't mess around.

362
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,120
When have you ever been scared?

363
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:54,750
Tian Ye,

364
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,580
did someone come home?

365
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,000
My mom's here.

366
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,210
My mom's here.

367
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,960
Why is it so dark? Why no lights?

368
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,170
Hello, Mrs. Tian.

369
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,550
Mrs. Tian.

370
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,290
Jing'an's here.

371
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,790
What were you doing just now?

372
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,090
Watching a movie.

373
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:19,710
Stay for dinner

374
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,830
tonight.

375
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,610
What do you want to eat?
I'll cook for you.

376
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,750
No need, Mrs. Tian.

377
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,540
My brother's waiting for me
at home for dinner.

378
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,120
Mrs. Tian, I'm leaving too.

379
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,800
Well...

380
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,050
Don't.

381
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,080
I'll settle this with you later.

382
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:37,960
Jing'an.

383
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,340
Hi.

384
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,330
I saw in a post

385
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,240
that you've experienced a swap.

386
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,720
Yeah, that's right.

387
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,040
Do you know what caused the swap?

388
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,660
How did you switch back in the end?

389
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,500
How long did it take?

390
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,080
Did it harm your body?

391
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,250
Come on.

392
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,330
I'm just bragging online.

393
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,370
Do you really have to dig so deep?

394
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,800
(The Black Hole War)

395
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,010
(A Brief History of Time)

396
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,620
No way.

397
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,330
My son's grown up.

398
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,540
He watches these risqué movies?

399
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,040
Back when we were only 20...

400
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,290
What are you talking about?

401
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,520
Kids at 16 or 17

402
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,120
are the most curious about these things.

403
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,540
Maybe your son

404
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,710
isn't any different.

405
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,620
But the key is

406
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,410
he was watching it with Jing'an.

407
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,540
What's wrong with him?

408
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,500
It sounds serious.

409
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:16,960
How could it not be serious?

410
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,040
You should have a talk with him.

411
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:20,870
What can I say?

412
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,590
I'm an adult.
Talking to him about this...

413
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,080
No, it'll be awkward.

414
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,870
It's the 21st century.

415
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:31,040
Why are your thoughts
still so old-fashioned?

416
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,600
Are you going to talk to him?

417
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,340
About what?

418
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,020
Come here.

419
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:38,870
Your dad wants to talk to you.

420
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,340
Come on.

421
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,560
I have something to say.

422
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,000
We need to talk.

423
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,790
What's up?

424
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,370
You shameless kid.

425
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,800
Be honest.

426
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,960
Say it.

427
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,340
The movies...

428
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,870
Kids at your age

429
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:13,750
shouldn't

430
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,120
watch these.

431
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,830
You even brought Jing'an along.

432
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,250
Come on.

433
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,250
We just watched a horror movie.

434
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,960
I've been there before.

435
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,560
Who watches horror movies sneakily?

436
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,290
We really just watched a horror movie.

437
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,000
Last time, my mom

438
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,880
was scared to tears.

439
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,290
I just didn't want her to embarrass me
in front of my classmates.

440
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,580
It's so late already.

441
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,210
What are you talking about?

442
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,750
Go to sleep now.

443
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,460
I'm so tired.

444
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,370
You sold me out again, huh?

445
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,200
I'm going to the bathroom.

446
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,600
(Chen Changning, Grade, 1)

447
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,500
My god.

448
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,830
Chen Changning
got the first place again.

449
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:14,210
He'll go to Tsinghua
or Peking University for sure.

450
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,540
Stop envying him.

451
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,830
He secured direct admission
after winning

452
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,560
the physics competition last semester.

453
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,000
Niannian, did you hear that?

454
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,210
Chen Changning is amazing.

455
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,080
Let me see how you did.

456
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,040
Let's go, let's go.

457
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,410
Look at Chen Jing'an
and Zhu Niannian's scores.

458
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,870
They just switched classes, right?

459
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,320
But they still ranked in the top ten.

460
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,970
Zhu Niannian got first in physics again.

461
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,260
These scores are unreal.

462
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,500
Good looking and smart.

463
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,430
How are the rest of us supposed to live?

464
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,540
Niannian, you're incredible.

465
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,790
How did you do it?

466
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,120
Let's keep a low profile.

467
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,410
You're awesome. A perfect score.

468
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,250
A perfect score.

469
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,630
Chen Jing'an.

470
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,210
Why are you here?

471
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,880
Celebrating.

472
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,660
Awesome, Chen Jing'an.

473
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,620
You scored so well
after switching classes.

474
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,870
Lin in Class 1

475
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,960
praised you to the skies.

476
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,960
Your favorite.

477
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,370
I bought a lot for you.

478
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,620
Thanks, but I don't eat Latiao.

479
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,120
I mean,

480
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,000
I've got pimples, so I can't eat spicy.

481
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,600
No worries.

482
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,460
You can eat it

483
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,670
when the pimples

484
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,050
are gone.

485
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,180
You should head back to class.

486
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,160
Thanks for the Latiao.

487
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,000
Thank you.

488
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,350
Look at this new book I bought:

489
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,500
Thunder Assault.

490
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:52,870
It says so well:

491
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,160
We are the long sword of the PLAAF.

492
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,780
We are the shoulders of the motherland.

493
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,610
I've wanted this book for a long time.

494
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,660
The packaging isn't even opened.
Don't unwrap it.

495
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,500
Tian Ye.

496
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,000
What's wrong? You look so down.

497
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,360
How many times have you gone over it?

498
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:10,860
Still can't face your scores?

499
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,500
I feel like Chen Jing'an
doesn't care about me.

500
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,580
I think I'm going
to lose her as a friend.

501
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,190
What's wrong with you?

502
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,330
She's been ignoring me.

503
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,550
She didn't tell me
about the class change,

504
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:40,510
and she rejected

505
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,160
the Latiao I gave her just now.

506
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,040
Don't take it too hard.

507
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,530
Women's hearts
are like needles in the ocean.

508
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,000
Forced melons

509
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:50,210
aren't sweet.

510
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,460
Some people are destined

511
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:54,250
to just be passing by in your life.

512
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,910
My heart feels so bad.

513
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,120
It hurts.

514
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:07,550
Xinyi,

515
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,580
early next month,

516
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,160
our school will celebrate

517
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,000
its 60th anniversary.

518
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,910
You're our class leader

519
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,080
and the activity coordinator.

520
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,290
You should organize your classmates

521
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:17,660
and get some performances ready.

522
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,960
I heard the TV station
will come to record.

523
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,090
It's a good chance

524
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,620
for you to relax

525
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,870
after the joint exam.

526
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,130
No problem, Ms. Yu.

527
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,090
What's wrong?

528
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,500
It's not okay.

529
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,360
I can't just end my friendship

530
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,040
with Chen Jing'an after all these years.

531
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,210
What can you do?

532
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,410
I'll talk to Lin.

533
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,180
I want to switch my class.

534
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:52,750
Hey, don't be impulsive.

535
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,230
I've thought it through.

536
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,790
I'll say I saw my joint exam results

537
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,540
and felt I should change.

538
00:27:58,790 --> 00:27:59,710
After deep reflection,

539
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,550
I realized I'm not cut out for science.

540
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,530
Maybe

541
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:03,960
if I go to the liberal arts class,

542
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,290
I'll have a chance to start over.

543
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,000
Looks like you're really all in.

544
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,040
Chen Jing'an, I didn't expect

545
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,580
your liberal arts talent to be so good.

546
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,870
You should've come to our class earlier.

547
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,250
But it's not too late now.

548
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,040
Sorry, Ms. Yu.

549
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,340
I need Chen Jing'an for a moment.

550
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,180
Hurry up.

551
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,460
I want to tell Tian Ye about our swap.

552
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,090
Why?

553
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:40,870
Didn't you say

554
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:42,620
no one else should know?

555
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,010
Tian Ye thinks I'm his friend anymore.

556
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,110
Today, he said he wants
to change to liberal arts.

557
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,110
I'm going crazy.

558
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,080
I'm just scared it'll slip out,

559
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,460
so I don't dare get too close to him.

560
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,160
I'm not blaming you.

561
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,000
I just don't want
to lose him as a friend.

562
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,500
He's trustworthy.

563
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,910
Do you agree if I tell him?

564
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,330
If you want to,

565
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,540
I support you.

566
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,500
Then it's settled.

567
