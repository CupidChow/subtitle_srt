=Episode 9=

3
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,500
Actually...

4
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,690
I'm Chen Jing'an.

5
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,250
Do you hear that?

6
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,460
Zhu Niannian,

7
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,140
today's not April Fools'.

8
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,180
Don't laugh.

9
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,350
I'm dead serious.

10
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,350
I really am Chen Jing'an.

11
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,390
Did you lose a dare

12
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,050
with Chen Jing'an?

13
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,430
Think carefully,

14
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,680
do you think the current Chen Jing'an

15
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,100
is the same as before?

16
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:46,890
Remember Li Minqiu

17
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,550
Li Minqiu hit her head
with a basketball?

18
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,350
Could that ever happen to me?

19
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:54,940
We

20
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,800
switched bodies.

21
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,850
You made up quite an elaborate story.

22
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,890
You're asking for my ultimate move, huh?

23
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,790
In grade 8, after fighting with your mom

24
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,140
you ran away from home,

25
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,550
took her bike,

26
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,300
broke your leg on the way, and ended up

27
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,140
in the hospital.

28
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,390
When I visited you in the hospital,

29
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,890
you were sobbing,

30
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,850
saying your mom didn't understand you.

31
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,250
You even cried, begging me

32
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,100
not to tell anyone
how pathetic you looked.

33
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,180
Would I expose that

34
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,390
just to trick you?

35
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,640
I swore an oath!

36
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,600
Wait, wait.

37
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Wait, wait, wait.

38
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,550
Hold on.

39
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,260
Let me process this.

40
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,270
Give me a second.

41
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,010
I need a moment.

42
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,180
Finish it, then let me copy.

43
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,100
I don't know how.

44
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,600
Go on.

45
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Don't be afraid.

46
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,360
You'll definitely beat him this time.

47
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,700
What's going on with you and Zhu Niannian?

48
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,350
You've been acting more like her.

49
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,760
Look,

50
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,760
just like her.

51
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,660
Nature calls—come with?

52
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,600
I just got here.

53
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
I thought you were Deng Shasha. My bad.

54
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,740
You won't tell on me, right?

55
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,680
You're acting just like

56
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,430
Chen Jing'an now.

57
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,950
You've seriously...

58
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,010
turned from Chen Jing'an

59
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:36,890
into Zhu Niannian?

60
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,930
Am I dreaming?

61
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,550
Does this hurt?

62
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:47,940
Yeah.

63
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,220
So what's really going...

64
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,230
Voice down.

65
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,140
Did you experience

66
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,100
something supernatural?

67
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,230
Nonsense.

68
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,050
There must be

69
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,640
some scientific explanation.

70
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,800
We just haven't figured it out yet.

71
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,800
I'm only telling you this.

72
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,320
Just the three of us know.

73
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:08,850
Don't tell anyone else.

74
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,220
I'm telling you because we're close.

75
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,140
Don't worry.

76
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,890
I'd never betray my buddy.

77
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,800
That's my buddy.

78
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,600
Good morning, everyone.

79
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,300
In spring's embrace,

80
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,430
we rise with pride,

81
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,850
celebrating

82
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,100
the 60th anniversary of our school.

83
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,390
Nancheng TV will film the event.

84
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,100
To showcase our students' spirit,

85
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,050
we're selecting hosts for the ceremony.

86
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,720
Interested students can sign up

87
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,430
at the student council office

88
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,720
before Wednesday.

89
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,890
The TV station is coming?

90
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,300
We'll be on TV?

91
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,100
Yeah. If you host,

92
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,890
your parents can see you at home.

93
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,640
Hosting's not for me.

94
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,970
You need looks and eloquence.

95
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,300
My bet's on Zhu Niannian this time.

96
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,300
Her?

97
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,140
She's just pretty.

98
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,350
In terms of eloquence,

99
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,930
wasn't Liu Xinyi in first place

100
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,600
in the last speech contest?

101
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:13,690
Exactly.

102
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,390
I think it'll be her.

103
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,050
Agreed.

104
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,140
Well, I just think

105
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,350
she's only good-looking.

106
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,140
Stop sighing.

107
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,600
You're one of the most admired teachers.

108
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,800
Why not perform at the event?

109
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,640
In front of students?

110
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,180
I'd be embarrassed.

111
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,390
Plus, I teach history.

112
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,800
I have no talents.

113
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,440
Unless

114
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,350
I perform a recitation

115
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,300
of "Records of the Grand Historian"?

116
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:01,930
Don't laugh.

117
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,470
Help me think of something.

118
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,100
How about

119
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,600
a Hanfu fashion show?

120
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,100
A Hanfu show?

121
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,850
That's even more awkward.

122
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,140
Why?

123
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,720
Just treat it like lecturing,

124
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,890
walk a bit, then step down.

125
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,390
Excuse me.

126
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,010
Niannian,

127
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,350
you're here to see Ms. Shi?

128
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,140
I called her here.

129
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,180
Zhu Niannian,

130
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,470
the anniversary is coming up.

131
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,250
No problem with

132
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,890
the Romeo and Juliet performance, right?

133
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:29,940
Performance?

134
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,550
(Why is there a performance?)

135
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,680
(Zhu Niannian never mentioned this.)

136
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,430
Tian Ye already knows

137
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,550
about us switching.

138
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,140
He promised not to tell.

139
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:44,980
Don't worry.

140
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,050
Also,

141
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,540
I originally planned to perform

142
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,550
a dance show with Tian Ye

143
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,680
for the anniversary.

144
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,680
But suddenly, Ms. Shi asked me

145
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,350
to do a play instead.

146
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,930
I didn't know the details,

147
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,140
so I didn't dare refuse.

148
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,550
This play

149
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,600
is not that important,

150
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
right?

151
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,600
No.

152
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,640
Last semester,

153
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,720
Ms. Shi asked me

154
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,390
if I wanted to join the play,

155
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,550
and I agreed.

156
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,850
I'm not

157
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,350
that into acting,

158
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,550
but

159
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,550
I couldn't refuse her.

160
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:16,850
Good.

161
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,050
I thought it was like

162
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,800
the speech contest last time.

163
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,100
If I messed up, I'd be done for.

164
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,430
If that's the case,

165
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,180
I'll just find a way to back out.

166
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,050
But

167
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,890
I already promised Ms. Shi.

168
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,100
Wouldn't backing out be rude?

169
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,140
It's not that important anyway.

170
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,140
If I don't do it,

171
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,390
they'll just find someone else.

172
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,550
No big deal.

173
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,600
Besides,

174
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,550
even though I'm pretending to be you,

175
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,640
I can't follow every single thing

176
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,140
you originally planned to do.

177
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,350
As long as it doesn't cause trouble,

178
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,680
I think I have the right

179
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:48,890
to choose what I do.

180
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:49,850
The same goes for you.

181
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,430
After all, we don't know

182
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,800
when we'll switch back.

183
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,180
What do you think?

184
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,890
You're right.

185
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,350
Actually,

186
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,100
I was planning to use your identity

187
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,140
to audition for the host competition.

188
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,680
Everyone would freak out!

189
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,890
Chen Jing'an as a host?

190
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,100
(Help!)

191
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,890
(Why am I even standing here?)

192
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,970
(Nancheng No.2 High School)

193
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,600
What's that over there?

194
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,140
That's the east.

195
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,800
Juliet is the sun!

196
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,140
Arise,

197
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,470
fair sun,

198
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,050
and kill the envious moon.

199
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,350
(Is this guy for real down there?)

200
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,850
Romeo, oh Romeo,

201
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,550
why must you be

202
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,220
Romeo?

203
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,420
He's not a foot,

204
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,510
he's not a hand,

205
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:22,100
he's not... a nose or face.

206
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,390
What is he?

207
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,300
Juliet, you flubbed your line.

208
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,350
I forgot.

209
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,350
Quick, go on.

210
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,720
Then I'll heed your words.

211
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,720
Call me but love,

212
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,050
and I'll be new baptized;

213
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,470
Henceforth

214
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,300
I never will be

215
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,100
Romeo!

216
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,550
What's the next line?

217
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,180
Who are you?

218
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:02,850
Are you

219
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,140
from Inner Mongolia?

220
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,300
Why are you standing here?

221
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,720
Romeo.

222
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,230
Stop, stop.

223
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,550
Zhu Niannian,

224
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,550
did you even memorize your lines?

225
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,220
"Inner Mongolia"?

226
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,050
It's "Montague"!

227
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:31,730
Ms. Shi,

228
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,390
this is too hard.

229
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,970
I just can't remember.

230
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,930
Zhu Niannian, what's wrong with you?

231
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,140
Lines forgotten,

232
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,600
props destroyed.

233
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,140
Ms. Shi,

234
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,720
I really can't memorize this.

235
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:52,730
Niannian,

236
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,220
didn't Ms. Shi make you rehearse?

237
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,500
If you perform like this
at the anniversary,

238
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,550
everyone will laugh at you.

239
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,300
Ms. Yu...

240
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,430
No more excuses.

241
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,640
Let's stop here today.

242
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,220
Go home and study your lines.

243
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,070
Next time, we'll do a full rehearsal.

244
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,600
Niannian,

245
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,300
you can do this. I believe in you.

246
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,350
Go for it.

247
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,390
Ms. Yu...

248
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,300
It's okay, Niannian.

249
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,720
I thought you were amazing just now.

250
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,890
I honestly felt like

251
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,390
the real Juliet was standing there.

252
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,220
Um,

253
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,350
Zhu Niannian,

254
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,720
let me introduce myself.

255
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,890
I'm Wang Lihong from Class 1, Grade 10.

256
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,600
Can I add you on QQ?

257
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:44,730
What's wrong?

258
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,260
Chen Jing'an,

259
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,930
I heard Ms. Shi got mad

260
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,220
during your play rehearsal.

261
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,830
It's no big deal.

262
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,510
I never wanted to act anyway,

263
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,890
so I didn't memorize the lines.

264
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,390
Chen Jing'an,

265
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,800
maybe just do the play properly.

266
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,140
Don't antagonize Ms. Shi.

267
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,550
Acting is easier than exams.

268
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,430
Just treat it as

269
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,180
a relaxing after-school activity.

270
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,300
What do you mean by "antagonize"?

271
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,930
You're the one who said

272
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,300
you didn't want to do the play.

273
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,350
What,

274
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,180
you just blindly obey whatever she says?

275
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,780
Don't you have your own thoughts?

276
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,050
You're not a puppet.

277
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,300
Where's your sense of self?

278
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,790
I...

279
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,140
I might've been too harsh, but...

280
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,010
I get it now.

281
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,100
You're giving me attitude?

282
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,190
What happened?

283
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,220
Say something. What's wrong?

284
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,350
Step down.

285
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,430
Alright, class, settle down.

286
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,550
We have a new classmate.

287
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,640
Let's welcome him to introduce himself.

288
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,600
A round of applause.

289
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:33,760
Hi everyone,

290
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:34,890
I'm Li Minqiu.

291
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,390
Call me "Mr. Li",

292
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,730
and I've got your backs.

293
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,390
"Mr. Li"?

294
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,300
Hey, hey.

295
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,720
Quiet!

296
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,800
That's nonsense.

297
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,970
You're all classmates now.

298
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,430
Focus on your studies.

299
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,850
No funny business.

300
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:52,890
Go sit down.

301
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,220
Sir,

302
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,640
can I take that empty seat?

303
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,480
Sure.

304
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,850
Zhu Niannian's a top student.

305
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,680
Learn from her.

306
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,100
Niannian, help the new student out.

307
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,890
Class,

308
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,680
turn to page 28.

309
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,010
Niannian, surprised?

310
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,800
(Physics)

311
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,510
(Student Council)

312
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,640
Didn't expect
to see Chen Changning here.

313
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,630
Even if I don't get picked,
it's worth it.

314
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,440
Applicants,

315
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,300
focus on filling out the forms.

316
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,170
Eyes on

317
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,390
your own papers.

318
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,890
You're here to audition as hosts,

319
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,470
not to check out guys.

320
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,230
Chen Jing'an?

321
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,800
You're applying too?

322
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,180
You never join

323
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,720
school events like this.

324
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,350
I just

325
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,640
suddenly got interested in hosting.

326
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,930
Thought I'd give it a try.

327
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,390
Give it a try?

328
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,390
Don't bother.

329
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,050
Look how many applicants there are.

330
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,680
The competition's fierce.

331
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,300
If you're just here to play around,

332
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,180
you'll be cannon fodder.

333
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,390
But if you don't try,

334
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,930
how will you know the result?

335
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,140
The result?

336
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,550
I'll obviously take first place.

337
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,640
Don't count on luck in competitions.

338
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,320
Or

339
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,720
you'll embarrass yourself

340
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,800
and don't even know how.

341
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,640
Ever heard of a dark horse?

342
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,190
Exactly,

343
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,800
going from underestimated

344
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,430
to stunning everyone.

345
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:55,800
Thanks to

346
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,890
all the doubters.

347
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,220
Overprotective brother alert.

348
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,850
(Student Council)

349
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,850
Niannian, want candy?

350
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,300
No, thanks.

351
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,230
Do you like it?

352
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,100
If you take my candy,

353
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,230
trade seats with me.

354
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,140
You already ate it.

355
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:51,690
I didn't.

356
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,600
Don't bully my deskmate.

357
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:03,980
Niannian,

358
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,400
you always took my side as kids.

359
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,260
Niannian,

360
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,930
let's go to the cafeteria.

361
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,100
Tian Ye's coming too.

362
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:17,730
Me too.

363
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:22,730
Fine, fine.

364
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,690
Li Minqiu,

365
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:34,350
didn't you graduate?

366
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,640
Why are you here now?

367
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,890
I flunked college entrance exam last year.

368
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,220
My grandpa

369
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,680
insists I'm college material.

370
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,680
Made me repeat a grade.

371
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,890
I thought it was pointless,

372
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:49,890
but now it's different.

373
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,140
The truth is

374
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,140
I came back for someone.

375
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:57,850
Who? Spill it.

376
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,640
Stop being nosy. Eat your food.

377
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:08,850
Hey, Chen...

378
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,510
Zhu Niannian,

379
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:14,890
um...

380
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,220
How's your dance prep going?

381
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,050
The anniversary is coming.

382
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,800
No worries, count on me.

383
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,550
What dance?

384
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,640
What anniversary?

385
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,180
You're new.

386
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,550
Our school's 60th anniversary is coming.

387
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,180
Each class can perform.

388
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,230
Zhu Niannian and I

389
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,220
prepared a dance performance

390
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,390
to hype up the crowd.

391
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,640
Two people aren't enough.

392
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,550
Add me in.

393
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,930
Sure, why not?

394
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,470
Go, go, go!

395
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:03,450
Come on!

396
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,640
Faster!

397
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,430
Faster, faster!

398
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,480
Go for it.

399
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,140
Go for it.

400
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:18,280
Go for it.

401
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,140
Go for it.

402
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,600
Go for it.

403
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,770
Go for it.

404
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:31,990
Go for it.

405
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:33,890
Go for it.

406
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,640
Faster, faster!

407
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,350
Go for it!

408
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,640
Come on!

409
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,540
Faster!

410
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,890
Go for it!

411
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,010
Go for it!

412
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,260
Come on!

413
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,100
Faster, faster!

414
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,480
Come on!

415
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,550
Seven.

416
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,550
Twenty-five.

417
00:19:55,550 --> 00:20:01,530
Come on!

418
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,180
Niannian, where's mine?

419
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,600
Suit yourself.

420
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,800
Go for it!

421
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,190
Go for it!

422
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,970
Come on!

423
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:14,850
Tian Ye!

424
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:15,690
Come here.

425
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:21,310
Come on!

426
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,640
Go help Xiaopang.

427
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,510
Run with him.

428
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,640
Why me?

429
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,600
You're the P.E. rep.

430
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,180
Take responsibility.

431
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,050
Go on!

432
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:30,800
Move.

433
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,860
Tian Ye, you can do it!

434
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,050
Tian Ye, you can do it!

435
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,750
Tian Ye.

436
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,390
Seriously,

437
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,220
Tian Ye is such a dedicated P.E. rep.

438
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,600
Come on!

439
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:42,850
He?

440
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,510
Yeah.

441
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,970
Come on!

442
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,140
Half a lap left.

443
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,260
You can do it.

444
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,550
Can you speed up?

445
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,390
Yes!

446
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,230
I'll pace you.

447
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,480
Try to keep up.

448
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,240
Tian Ye, thanks.

449
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,050
Niannian, an ice pop?

450
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:49,690
Thanks.

451
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,230
Where's mine?

452
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,140
You've got water.

453
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,470
Niannian, how's your prep?

454
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,800
Today

455
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,050
is the full rehearsal.

456
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:23,890
Sorry, Ms. Shi.

457
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,140
I'm not ready.

458
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,230
What?

459
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,100
You're backing out now?

460
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,550
You expect everyone

461
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,800
to wait for you?

462
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,300
Do you even want to perform?

463
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,640
I don't.

464
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,550
What do you say?

465
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,390
What's wrong?

466
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,050
Who wants to play Juliet now?

467
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,350
Me!

468
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,800
Can I cross-dress?

469
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:45,890
See?

470
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,640
If you won't play Juliet,

471
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,890
others will.

472
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,590
When you commit to something,

473
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,800
follow through.

474
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,350
That's basic respect

475
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,680
for others and yourself.

476
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:55,850
Look at them.

477
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,850
Even the extras,

478
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,140
the background actors with no lines,

479
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,850
are trying harder than you.

480
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,390
Last chance.

481
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,390
Think carefully.

482
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,800
Got it, Ms. Shi.

483
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,190
Niannian,

484
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,390
what's going on?

485
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,600
You agreed to this.

486
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,050
Why did you suddenly back out?

487
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,050
Ms. Yu,

488
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:51,430
I'm sorry.

489
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,720
Don't apologize to me.

490
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,640
This play is Ms. Shi's passion project.

491
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,180
She believed in you.

492
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,720
Backing out now

493
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,050
lets her down.

494
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,640
Ms. Yu,

495
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,680
I need more time.

496
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,180
Don't make a decision you'll regret.

497
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,440
Perform.

498
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:27,850
Don't perform.

499
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:29,850
Perform.

500
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,600
Don't perform.

501
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,190
Don't perform.

502
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,100
Perform.

503
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,600
Guess it's decided.

504
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:47,700
Fine,

505
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,850
I'll grudgingly

506
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:49,690
do it.

507
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,010
No.

508
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:58,890
I'm good.

509
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,430
What's up?

510
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,430
I've got to focus on the play now.

511
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:04,970
I can't join your performance.

512
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,140
What?

513
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,390
Keep it down.

514
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,470
I'm not surprised

515
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,680
since you've got other options.

516
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,140
Tian Ye, what's wrong?

517
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:17,850
Zhu Niannian

518
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:18,970
is quitting the play.

519
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,470
Our dance plan

520
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,680
is ruined.

521
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:23,890
Dance plan?

522
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,550
Need one more for it?

523
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:26,850
How about me?

524
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,230
You?

525
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:30,890
He's perfect.

526
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,390
Chubby and cute,

527
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:33,690
unexpected charm.

528
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:40,730
Zhu Niannian,

529
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,680
I was too harsh

530
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,550
last time.

531
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,390
I'm sorry.

532
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,850
Don't stay mad.

533
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,300
About the play,

534
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,140
I've decided to perform.

535
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,800
But when it comes to stage acting,

536
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,350
I don't have much

537
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:57,730
experience.

538
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,600
So, can you teach me

539
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,940
how to act?

540
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:08,760
No.

541
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:10,600
That sounds too embarrassing.

542
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,440
Zhu Niannian,

543
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,350
I went too far last time.

544
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:18,940
I'm sorry.

545
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,470
Please

546
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,720
don't stay mad at me.

547
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,230
Also,

548
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,300
about the play,

549
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,470
I've decided to do it.

550
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,390
No need to thank me.

551
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,640
It's what I should do.

552
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:30,940
But,

553
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,640
for the sake of your image,

554
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,050
you have to

555
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,050
teach me

556
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,640
how to act in this play.

557
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,640
No, that sounds too arrogant.

558
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,010
Chen Jing'an.

559
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,940
Chen Jing'an.

560
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,050
I know you're under pressure,

561
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,890
but don't do anything reckless.

562
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,470
Stay strong.

(Nancheng No. 2 High School)

564
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:09,850
Chen Changning,

565
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,640
can you come to the print shop with me?

566
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,640
I want to print out the script

567
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,640
for Romeo and Juliet.

568
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,100
Why print the script?

569
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,680
Jing'an is helping me with the play,

570
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,640
but she's struggling a bit.

571
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,890
I want to help her.

572
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,470
Act in a play?

573
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:27,850
She's playing Juliet?

574
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:30,890
Someone like Chen Jing'an

575
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,140
is only fit for a farce.

576
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:34,980
Let's go.

579

00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,470
Jing'an has no stage experience.

581
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,430
The script has lots of lines.

582
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,970
She has to memorize them all,

583
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,800
plus deliver them with emotion.

584
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,800
It's really challenging for her.

585
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,100
But

586
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,470
I'll mark the script

587
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,640
and do my best to help her.

588
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,800
I'll rehearse with Chen Jing'an.

589
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,930
If you read the male lines for her,

590
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,010
she'll break character.

591
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,260
Compared to you,

592
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,640
I'll rehearse more effectively with her.

593
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,640
She's acting on your behalf.

594
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,300
You don't want her to mess up.

595
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,800
But

596
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,970
how should I tell Chen Jing'an?

597
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:45,850
No need.

598
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,540
I'll go straight to her.

599
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:49,890
Good.

600
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,230
Thanks.

601
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,140
I was just thinking

602
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,720
Jing'an's lucky
to have a brother like you.

603
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,510
(Romeo and Juliet Script)

604
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,350
You did all this?

605
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,430
I even recorded some lines.

606
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,680
If you're unsure about the emotions,

607
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:36,930
you can refer to this.

608
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,300
Isn't this my Walkman?

609
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,640
What,

610
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,430
afraid I'll embarrass you again?

611
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,550
Yes.

612
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,890
You already humiliated me
in the last speech contest.

613
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,220
This time, don't ruin the play.

614
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,100
Got it?

615
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,390
You really don't trust me?

616
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,970
You think I can't do anything right?

617
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,390
Jing'an,

618
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,430
don't stress too much.

619
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,800
This isn't your strength anyway.

620
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,390
Just do your best.

621
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:05,940
Besides,

622
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,300
this was originally my task.

623
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,640
I'm just grateful

624
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,220
you're helping me.

625
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:13,890
You're welcome.

626
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,480
Actually,

627
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,390
I've thought about

628
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,850
what you said.

629
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,050
A lot of times,

630
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,140
I struggle to say no

631
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:28,890
or express my true feelings.

632
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,220
I'll work on changing that.

633
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,390
Honestly,

634
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,680
I was wrong too.

635
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,140
Back then,

636
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,240
I only thought about myself

637
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,640
and ignored your feelings.

638
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:41,760
I'm sorry.

639
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,640
It's fine.

640
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:45,730
So…

641
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,220
are we good now?

642
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,930
I wasn't that mad anyway.

643
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,600
I just said those things in anger.

644
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,720
I regretted it right after.

645
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,220
Let's rehearse after school.

646
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,720
Next practice,

647
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,300
we'll surprise everyone.

648
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,300
Deal.

649
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:08,600
(Grade 11)

650
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,640
Chen Jing'an, how's your draft?

651
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,390
Only halfway done.

652
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,350
Niannian's an experienced host.

653
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,640
Let's ask her after school

654
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,720
to review your draft

655
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,050
and give you some tips.

656
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:22,600
She's right.

657
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,050
You should ask Zhu Niannian for help.

658
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,640
That way,
competing with you will be fun.

659
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,390
No need.

660
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,100
I'll write it myself.

661
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,140
You're an amateur.

662
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,800
Why so stubborn?

663
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:37,850
Chen Jing'an,

664
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,340
with Niannian's guidance,

665
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,970
you might even place well.

666
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,550
Alright,

667
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,350
I'll go see her later.

668
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,890
Then tell her this:

669
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:48,730
Whether it's her

670
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:49,850
or her apprentice,

671
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,180
I'll win.

672
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,300
Ignore her.

673
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,550
Just focus on your draft.

674
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,220
When this class ends,

675
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,220
I'll find Niannian

676
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,100
and ask her to help you

677
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,350
after school.

678
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:07,640
We have a play rehearsal after school.

679
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,470
Just the two of you?

680
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:11,940
Yeah.

681
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,300
Can I join?

682
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,350
Probably not.

683
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,220
Niannian only invited me.

684
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:48,390
Guess you're completely out of favor.

685
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,350
Do you love me?

686
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,640
I know you'll say yes.

687
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:06,600
My dear, gentle Romeo,

688
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,800
if you truly love me,

689
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,640
show me with sincerity.

690
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,680
Why are you here?

691
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,050
I came to rehearse.

692
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:21,690
Rehearse what?

693
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:24,100
Romeo and Juliet.

694
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:26,220
(Romeo and Juliet Script)

695
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,430
Chen Jing'an asked me
to help you rehearse.

696
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,300
She didn't tell me.

697
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,640
Maybe she forgot.

698
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,600
When she comes,

699
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,490
have her tell you herself.

700
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,510
Whatever.

701
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,220
Better than rehearsing alone.

702
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,390
You play the guy.

703
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,550
Let's do the rehearsal.

704
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,600
Okay.

705
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,640
Don't deny you love him in front of me.

706
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,050
I'll admit I love him to your face.

707
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:07,890
Your tone's wrong.

708
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,180
That's not how Juliet speaks.

709
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:11,690
Too harsh.

710
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,430
But she's being forced into marriage.

711
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,890
She loves Romeo so much,

712
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,220
and Paris is so annoying.

713
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,350
Shouldn't she be angry?

714
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,890
Juliet's a noble lady.

715
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,930
Even if she resists the marriage,

716
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:28,850
she wouldn't be rude.

717
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,100
Then what's the point?

718
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,390
Having to be polite

719
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,640
to someone you hate.

720
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,100
The audience would be frustrated.

721
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
So to you,

722
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:39,800
being rude means

723
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:41,930
you dislike someone?

724
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:42,850
Obviously.

725
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:43,600
Or should I say,

726
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,640
"I like you" to them?

727
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,640
Why talk about this?

728
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,800
Let's focus on the script.

729
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,350
Jing'an, you're finally here.

730
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:57,640
Why'd you bring your brother?

731
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,470
He's bossy and unhelpful.

732
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,640
Sorry.

733
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,890
But Tian Ye's group is rehearsing too.

734
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,390
I had no choice.

735
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,640
I'm not blaming you.

736
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:12,730
But...

737
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,140
a Romeo like him

738
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,350
saying he'll elope with me?

739
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,720
Not romantic at all.

740
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,600
I'd just call the police.

741
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,050
"Help, police!"

742
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,550
- Am I that scary?
- Very scary.

743
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:27,140
For the play's sake,

744
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,550
just bear with him, okay?

745
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:34,850
Fine.

746
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,390
I'll do it for you,

747
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:38,140
rehearsing with him.

748
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,720
We're short on time.

749
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,180
Let's start rehearsing.

750
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,220
First, the farewell scene.

751
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,640
It's crucial.

752
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,130
- Okay.
- Alright.

753
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,100
Then let day in,

754
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,390
and let life out.

755
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,100
Farewell,

756
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,300
farewell!

757
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,220
One kiss,

758
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,720
and I'll descend.

759
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,140
Are you leaving so? My lord.

760
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:04,890
Wait a moment.

761
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,440
What's wrong?

762
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:08,890
I just think...

763
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,890
your line delivery

764
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:12,390
sounds too stiff.

765
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,390
You're playing

766
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,550
lovers now.

767
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,890
Even friends hug when parting.

768
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,140
Otherwise, it looks fake.

769
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,350
The audience will criticize you.

770
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,600
But we can't hug.

771
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:29,690
That'd be so awkward.

772
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:31,720
Maybe hand-holding.

773
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,970
Let's try it like this first.

774
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,550
Don't move.

775
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,010
Now say your lines.

776
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,300
Then...

777
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,440
farewell,

778
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:54,800
my...

779
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,100
friend,

780
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:58,690
my lord,

781
00:36:58,890 --> 00:36:59,890
my love.

782
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,050
We'll meet again,

783
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,480
my beloved.

784
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,470
I'll never miss a chance

785
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,890
