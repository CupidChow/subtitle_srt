00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,970
=Episode 5=

3
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:11,900
Jing'an!

4
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,360
Niannian? Why are you here?

5
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,270
To watch someone catch a cheater.

6
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,110
Catch what?

7
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:24,770
Umâ€¦

8
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,980
Let me treat you to milk tea.

9
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:28,730
Great!

10
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:31,980
I'll have snow cap milk tea,

11
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,980
full sugar with bobas,

12
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,180
and extra ice cream.

13
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,100
Welcome!

14
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,310
I'll have snow cap milk tea,

15
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,540
full sugar with bobas

16
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,020
and extra ice cream.

17
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,080
Hello.

18
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,430
Attention, students.

19
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,770
Students.

20
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,770
The city's top high school leaders

21
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,810
have decided

22
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,480
that the monthly exam,

23
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,340
scheduled for the end of the month,

24
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,890
will be a nine-school joint exam.

25
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,480
In other words,

26
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,730
students from nine high schools

27
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,020
will have exams together.

28
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,890
The exam date

29
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,900
has been moved up.

30
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,100
The exam is approaching.

31
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,980
Students,

32
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,810
please prepare it thoroughly.

33
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,140
Study hard,

34
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,980
live up to your youth,

35
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,560
and live up to yourselves.

36
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,930
What? A joint exam? So soon?

37
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,640
This is too sudden.

38
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,110
That's not the point.
I studied sciences.

39
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,140
How do I handle
your liberal arts subjects?

40
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,180
I don't know either.

41
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,400
What do we do now?

42
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,900
Zhu Niannian,

43
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,310
the homeroom teacher asks for you.

44
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:51,890
Go ahead,

45
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:52,930
we'll talk later.

46
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,270
You've heard about

47
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,770
the exam being moved up

48
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,270
and changed to a joint test, right?

49
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,140
Your recent performance worries me.

50
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,390
I spoke with your mom earlier.

51
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,730
You promised her

52
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,060
you'd rank in the top 10 this time.

53
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,930
I'm glad you're determined,

54
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,230
but if you need any help

55
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,430
with studies

56
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,520
or anything else,

57
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,680
just tell me.

58
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,680
You'll get the support you need.

59
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,350
Top... 10?

60
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:32,650
Yeah.

61
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:33,770
What's wrong?

62
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,140
Didn't you promise this?

63
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,190
Ma'am,

64
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,730
do you really think I can make it?

65
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:42,710
Niannian,

66
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,390
you're a top student.

67
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,310
I've always had
high expectations for you.

68
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,100
Judging by

69
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,360
your past results,

70
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,980
I believe

71
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,260
if you study seriously,

72
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,350
you can make it.

73
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,930
The key is maintaining the right mindset.

74
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,100
Ma'am,

75
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,180
what if...

76
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,010
I don't...

77
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,520
make the top 10?

78
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,480
Niannian,

79
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,390
I have full confidence in you.

80
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,350
You need to believe in yourself too.

81
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,190
Understand?

82
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:22,760
Chen Jing'an.

83
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,760
You know,

84
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,100
the joint exam is coming up.

85
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,100
What about it?

86
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,470
Chen Jing'an,

87
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,050
let's make a deal, okay?

88
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,760
What kind of deal?

89
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:33,850
Well,

90
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,300
could you help me

91
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,140
with this exam?

92
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,440
No.

93
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,970
Why not?

94
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,850
We've worked together

95
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,300
pretty well before.

96
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,760
If I fail this time,

97
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,510
my mom will hunt me down again.

98
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,930
I'm your best buddy.

99
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,800
You wouldn't abandon me, right?

100
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,010
But I really can't help you this time.

101
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,100
Chen Jing'an,

102
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,430
I... I won't copy everything.

103
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,390
Just help me pass.

104
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,220
I truly can't.

105
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,800
Besides, this joint exam is different.

106
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,300
We'll have texts

107
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,890
in separate classrooms.

108
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,390
This time...

109
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,180
you'll have to rely on yourself.

110
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,140
I'm dead...

111
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,390
Study hard.

112
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,180
You might do well this time.

113
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,350
Letting you copy would just harm you.

114
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:29,990
Since when did you become

115
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,850
such a moralizer?

116
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,470
Don't give me that

117
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,640
"If you copy now,

118
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,630
whom will you copy from

119
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,050
during the college entrance exams?"

120
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,470
That's not what I meant.

121
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,300
I mean...

122
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,560
this time,

123
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,180
I'm not even confident in myself,

124
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,890
let alone able to help you.

125
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,600
Whatever.

126
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,140
Forget it.

127
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,100
That excuse is too lame.

128
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,760
I don't want to hear it.

129
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,550
Leave me alone.

130
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,430
Niannian,

131
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,300
was it the homeroom teacher?

132
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,050
What did she want?

133
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,970
She expects me to make the top 10.

134
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,260
How am I supposed to do that?

135
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,100
Top 10 in the grade...

136
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,050
It's not that hard, is it?

137
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,550
You're a great student.

138
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,930
You could easily rank top 10.

139
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,140
Don't stress.

140
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,180
Am I really that good?

141
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:30,720
Did you forget?

142
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,550
Last exam, you had a stomachache,

143
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,470
left early, and still got top 15.

144
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:35,850
This time,

145
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,100
just watch your diet,

146
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,300
and the top 10 is guaranteed.

147
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,760
(But I'm not Zhu Niannian...)

148
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,260
(My liberal arts skills are trash.)

149
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,680
Don't worry too much.

150
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,470
I can study with you.

151
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,430
Tomorrow is Saturday.

152
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,010
Let's go to the library.

153
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,310
You go ahead.

154
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,470
I've got stuff to do.

155
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,180
Really not going?

156
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,180
I heard Chen Changning

157
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,800
frequents the library on weekends.

158
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:18,350
You might even run into him.

159
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,720
Why would I want that?

160
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,720
Here's a secret.

161
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,800
I saw your sister

162
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,510
sneaking off to the rock garden.

163
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,270
Look, look.

164
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,390
Look.

165
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,270
See?

166
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,510
Could you make the top 10
in liberal arts?

167
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,640
If I try hard... maybe?

168
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,680
You could, but I can't.

169
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,100
I only told your mom I'd get top 10

170
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,140
to make her happy.

171
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,600
Now the teacher expects it too.

172
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,260
She's backing me into a corner.

173
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,760
I'm sorry.

174
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,970
My mom and the homeroom teacher

175
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,720
always expect a lot more of me.

176
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,010
Don't apologize.

177
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,930
I'm not blaming you.

178
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,890
But I'm really not good

179
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,800
at liberal arts.

180
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,550
Politics and history make my head ache.

181
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,550
We need to figure out how to handle it.

182
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,140
I don't know either.

183
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,010
My science grades are awful.

184
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,220
I checked online.

185
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,930
No meteor showers anytime soon.

186
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,140
I think

187
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,600
we should take the initiative.

188
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,690
Let's see

189
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,800
if there's another way

190
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,720
to switch back our bodies.

191
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,970
Do you want to switch back?

192
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,180
This isn't about wishes.

193
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
We can't handle the joint exam.

194
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,010
We have to switch back.

195
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,350
Do you have any leads?

196
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,600
Earlier you mentioned

197
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,680
magnetic fields

198
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,600
and time travel.

199
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,050
I really couldn't understand.

200
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,760
Let me think.

201
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,300
I remember Chen Changning
had a book in his room,

202
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,600
a rare edition

203
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,640
Aunt bought from abroad.

204
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:31,850
It's called...

205
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,060
"The Big Bang".

206
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,260
It mentioned

207
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,800
some foreign scientist

208
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,930
already conducting experiments on this.

209
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,640
I just skimmed it before.

210
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,550
The details are fuzzy.

211
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,640
Why don't you get that book

212
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,600
so we can study it?

213
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,720
Don't let Chen Changning find out.

214
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,220
Isn't that stealing?

215
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,550
Changning and I are family.

216
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,050
We're just borrowing it.

217
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,470
I'm worried you'll get caught

218
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,430
and told him the truth.

219
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,760
- But...
- No buts.

220
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,620
Friday afternoon,

221
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,720
his exam runs late.

222
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,220
That's your chance.

223
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,310
A last-ditch attempt.

224
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,680
It's our only way.

225
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,550
What are you doing here?

226
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,130
I...

227
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,270
I...

228
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,390
I was just talking to Chen Jing'an.

229
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,640
No?

230
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,050
Hiding to talk?

231
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,970
Private chats require hiding.

232
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,890
Should I use a loudspeaker?

233
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,970
More importantly, Changning,

234
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,430
why are you here?

235
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,100
Don't tell me

236
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,680
you're playing love police again.

237
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,050
I was passing by

238
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,560
and saw you.

239
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,140
What a coincidence.

240
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,850
You police the skies, the earth,

241
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,390
and now girl talk thing too?

242
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:00,850
Chen Jing'an.

243
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,300
Stop laughing.

244
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,020
It's noisy.

245
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,720
You police the skies, the earth,

246
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,850
and now my laughter too?

247
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,430
Why are you staring at me?

248
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:21,690
Class is starting.

249
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,430
Aren't you going back?

250
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,390
Fine, bye.

251
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,510
Steal the book.

252
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:50,980
Time to eat.

253
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,800
What's the special occasion today?

254
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Why'd you make so much good food?

255
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:57,770
Your mom

256
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,760
made all this to support your studies.

257
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,800
Oh, I heard

258
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,970
your monthly exam

259
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,010
got changed to a nine-school joint exam.

260
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:09,770
Yeah.

261
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,720
I was just about to tell you.

262
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,270
Listen,

263
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,970
you better study hard.

264
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,300
You promised me

265
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,680
top 10 in your grade.

266
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,600
I haven't forgotten.

267
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,020
Top 10...

268
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:27,810
Right.

269
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,220
I have to make the top 10.

270
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,970
(Screw top 10.)

271
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,260
(I'd rather die!)

272
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,140
What if...

273
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,470
Just hypothetically,

274
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:46,810
what if

275
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,390
I mess up

276
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,260
and don't make the top 10?

277
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,060
It's fine.

278
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,300
As long as

279
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,550
you tried your best

280
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,010
and have no regrets.

281
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,180
Top 10 means top 10.

282
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:02,890
Not even one place short.

283
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,800
Why're you back so early today?

284
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,490
I finished the test early.

285
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,140
Are you expecting me?

286
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,690
No.

287
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,260
Any plans for dinner?

288
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,430
Anything's fine.

289
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,430
Did you steal the book?

290
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,910
No.

291
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,680
Chen Changning came home early.

292
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,550
Hey.

293
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,850
Can you talk now?

294
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,020
Yes.

295
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,050
We can't wait any longer.

296
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,260
Your mom expects me to make the top 10.

297
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,890
How can I do that?

298
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,220
Figure something out.

299
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,550
We need to get that book.

300
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,020
But

301
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,510
what if I really steal it,

302
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,640
and Chen Changning notices it's gone?

303
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,180
He'll have more doubts, right?

304
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,350
Good point.

305
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,510
Then how about this?

306
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,100
You find a way

307
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,510
to lure Chen Changning out,

308
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:55,690
and I'll go check

309
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,180
the book myself.

310
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,430
I'll return it without anyone noticing,

311
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,140
and he won't suspect a thing.

312
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,050
Does that book

313
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,850
really have a way to switch us back?

314
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,450
I won't know until I read it.

315
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,190
Fine.

316
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,050
You looking at me?

317
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,850
Aren't you going to the library today?

318
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,350
Why would I go there?

319
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,680
I mean,

320
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,260
the joint exam is coming up.

321
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,050
You should focus on studying.

322
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,930
Since when do you care about my grades?

323
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,550
Isn't it normal

324
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,890
for me to care?

325
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:11,730
Alright.

326
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:12,940
Let's go together.

327
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,100
No, no.

328
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,640
I'll pass.

329
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,050
It's fine if I flunk,

330
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,260
but you've got that recommendation exam.

331
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,300
I heard

332
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,220
they consider your usual grades too.

333
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:27,980
Fine,

334
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,100
I'll go.

335
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,970
When will you be back?

336
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,520
I'llâ€¦

337
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:53,810
come back later.

338
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:54,980
Okay.

339
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,930
Then, take care.

340
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,310
Strange.

341
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:35,640
I swear it was right here.

342
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,480
Where is it?

343
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,350
It used to be in this spot.
Where'd it go?

344
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,760
Niannian, haven't you seen it?

345
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,270
No, I haven't.

346
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,350
Did Chen Changning take it just now?

347
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,050
It's fine.

348
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,220
Anyway, Chen Changning's books

349
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,720
are all about astrophysics

350
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,560
and black holes.

351
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,470
Since I'm here, let's look around.

352
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,140
You check these first.

353
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,390
If you find any useful research,

354
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,230
let me know.

355
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,390
Why are you in my room?

356
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,390
Niannian

357
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,430
came over to hang out.

358
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,010
Why are you back?

359
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,140
But why are you in my room?

360
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,300
I asked Chen Jing'an
to give me a room tour.

361
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,430
Who wouldn't want to see

362
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,350
a top student's room, right?

363
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:18,890
I was expecting more.

364
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,600
But it's not that special.

365
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,440
Let's go.

366
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,300
My parents.

367
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,220
We're home.

368
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,600
Mom, Dad,

369
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,300
this is my classmate, Zhu Niannian.

370
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,640
She's here to hang out.

371
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:01,890
Niannian.

372
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:02,930
Hello, Niannian.

373
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,970
Hi, sir, ma'am.

374
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,220
This is the first time

375
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,390
Jing'an's brought

376
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,230
a girlfriend home.

377
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,640
Stay for dinner.

378
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:12,770
Where's your brother?

379
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,390
In his room.

380
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,190
Alright.

381
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,260
You two go play.

382
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,680
We'll start cooking.

383
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,260
Mom, Dad, let me help.

384
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,140
No need.

385
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,720
Niannian's visiting

386
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,930
for the first time.

387
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,190
Go keep her company.

388
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,140
Go on.

389
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,680
Spend time with her.

390
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,310
Okay.

391
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:40,730
Well,

392
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,440
don't you think

393
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,390
Jing'an's acting strange today?

394
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,720
You noticed too?

395
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,390
It's like she's trying extra hard

396
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,260
to impress her friend

397
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,350
around us.

398
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,720
Isn't it?

399
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,180
How's this taste?

400
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,510
Too salty.

401
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,800
I'll fix that next time.

402
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,050
Less salt.

403
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,640
I'm allergic to chives.

404
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,260
Niannian, what's up?

405
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,640
I just remembered I'm allergic to chives.

406
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,140
To chive dumplings?

407
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,320
Why aren't you eating either?

408
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,850
You love chive dumplings.

409
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,390
It's fine, Mom.

410
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,560
Just...

411
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,300
not hungry today.

412
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,140
Not hungry?

413
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:56,980
Stomachache?

414
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,930
I'll get you some medicine.

415
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,100
No, Dad.

416
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,680
Let me check.

417
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,260
Stick out your tongue.

418
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:08,680
What?

419
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,520
I'm a doctor.

420
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:10,890
Tongue out. Now.

421
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,560
Now.

422
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,850
You're perfectly fine.

423
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,100
Probably ate too fast.

424
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,680
Slow down, understand?

425
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,440
Niannian,

426
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,050
don't mind us.

427
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,050
Doctors are just

428
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:35,970
like this.

429
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:36,810
Back then,

430
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,230
at our hospital,

431
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,970
there was a TCM intern.

432
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,100
He had a poor appetite,

433
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,350
so he tried acupuncture

434
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,970
to cure himself.

435
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:45,850
And then

436
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:46,720
guess what happened?

437
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,070
He looked like a hedgehog

438
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,550
with all those acupuncture needles.

439
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,430
What kind of lame joke is that?

440
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:55,220
Here, Jing'an.

441
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,970
Don't want the chive dumplings?

442
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,180
How about some fish?

443
00:22:59,100 --> 00:22:59,940
Eat some fish.

444
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:00,970
Have some fish.

445
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:02,390
Fish is nutritious.

446
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,470
Here,

447
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:04,690
have this piece.

448
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,100
Thank you, Mom.

449
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,350
Eat up.

450
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,550
(They seem to)

451
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,850
(prefer Zhu Niannian as their daughter.)
Have more.

452
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,020
Kids,

453
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,140
time for fruit.

454
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,350
Here, Niannian,

455
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,560
have some fruit.

456
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,560
Changning,

457
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,680
Jing'an,

458
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,810
we need to talk.

459
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,310
Your father and I

460
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,510
have been too busy at the hospital,

461
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,600
with no time to care for you.

462
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,140
But once this busy period passes,

463
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,970
we'll try to stagger our shifts,

464
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:44,890
so at least

465
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,140
one of us can always be home.

466
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,980
Okay?

467
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,270
Okay.

468
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,470
Jing'an, happy about this?

469
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,600
Yes.

470
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,640
Really? So hesitant?

471
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,470
Ma'am, I should go now.

472
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,680
My dad's here to pick me up.

473
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,020
So soon?

474
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,850
Well then, Jing'an,

475
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,150
see your classmate out.

476
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,350
Look,

477
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,970
why is there a book in the cabinet?

478
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,300
Changning, is this yours?

479
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:17,690
What book?

480
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,970
(The Big Bang)

481
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:19,850
Yes.

482
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,350
But this book

483
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,720
was always in my room before.

484
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,760
I'll see Niannian out first.

485
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,300
Goodbye, sir, ma'am.

486
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,140
Bye, Niannian.

487
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,260
Goodbye, Niannian.

488
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,430
Come visit again sometime.

489
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,850
(The Big Bang)

490
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,800
No need to walk me out, go back.

491
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:47,730
Niannian,

492
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,510
did you have fun

493
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,300
at your classmate's?

494
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:54,810
Yes.

495
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,350
Niannian,

496
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:58,800
tell Dad the truth.

497
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,470
Is something bothering you?

498
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,440
No.

499
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:03,770
Really?

500
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:05,890
But I feel like

501
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:07,970
you seem unhappy.

502
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,640
I am happy.

503
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,760
I have such a great dad,

504
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:18,010
such a great mom.

505
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,350
Plus

506
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,180
endless dresses to wear,

507
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:22,720
endless delicious food.

508
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,470
And Dad drives me to school every day.

509
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,930
I'd wake up laughing from dreams.

510
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,300
How could I not be happy?

511
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:48,760
(The Big Bang)

512
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,850
Why is there a book in the cabinet?

513
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,300
Changning, is this yours?

514
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,890
I'll see Niannian out first.

515
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,180
(The Big Bang)

516
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,510
(Soul Exchange)

517
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:19,720
(Soul Exchange)

518
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,390
Chen Jing'an,

519
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,350
what do we do now?

520
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,180
(Niannian)
Niannian,

521
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,850
I don't want to switch back.

522
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,640
Chen Jing'an,

523
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:37,220
why are you suddenly saying that?

524
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,220
I just think

525
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,470
there's not much time left before exams.

526
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,890
Even if we find useful information,

527
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,850
there wouldn't be time to switch back.

528
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,220
Might as well spend time

529
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,180
on something more meaningful.

530
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,010
That makes sense.

531
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,560
Besides,

532
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,510
I haven't had enough of

533
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,720
being the campus belle yet.

534
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,930
Alright, I'll follow your lead.

535
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,970
What should we do next?

536
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:09,850
Don't ask me now. I need more time.

537
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:13,800
(Grade 11)

538
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,140
(Five Days Until Joint Exams)

539
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,970
"Alone I stand in the autumn cold,"

540
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,510
"On the tip of Orange Islet,"

541
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,350
"the Xiangjiang River flowing northward."

542
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,890
"All mountains had become red..."

543
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,430
My crush,

544
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,600
please bless me to pass the exam.

545
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,140
The activity period
is changed to history class.

546
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:25,770
Stand up.

547
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,680
Good morning, ma'am.

548
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:32,300
Good morning, class.

549
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,970
(Back in Class 1,)

550
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,350
(English and math
stole activity periods.)

551
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,930
(Now in Class 8,)

552
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,850
(even history takes them.)

553
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,220
The joint exams are coming.

554
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,510
Look at your attitudes,

555
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,100
do you look ready for exams?

556
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,390
Listen up,

557
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:50,740
this is

558
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,970
a nine-school joint exam.

559
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,800
You must focus

560
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,760
and study hard.

561
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,680
Give it your best shot.

562
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,550
Understood?

563
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,640
Understood.

564
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,010
Louder!

565
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,680
Understood!

566
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:05,930
Alright,

567
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,180
turn to page

568
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,190
fifteen.

569
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,300
Thanks.

570
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,140
You're welcome.

571
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:14,770
Niannian,

572
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:15,850
I can tell Liu Xinyi

573
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,510
is determined to compete with you.

574
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,930
You have to beat her!

575
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,520
Have a seat.

576
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,640
Niannian,

577
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,260
let's sit over there.

578
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,510
You eat first. We need to talk.

579
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,600
Niannian...

580
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,440
Go ahead, eat.

581
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,050
I've been thinking all morning.

582
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,720
Since we can't

583
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,850
switch back right now,

584
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,510
we should quickly review

585
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,930
the subjects we're weak in

586
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,390
to at least handle the exam.

587
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,850
Your idea makes sense,

588
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,140
but the joint exams are just days away.

589
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,470
In such a short time,

590
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,140
there's no way we can catch up.

591
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,510
You're a science student.

592
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,350
You're good at logical thinking.

593
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,390
Liberal arts won't be hard for you.

594
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:21,010
Just memorize the key points,

595
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:22,510
and you'll manage the exams.

596
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:23,890
Sure,

597
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:25,680
you might not make the top 10,

598
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,140
but at least you won't fail miserably.

599
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,760
Are science students really that amazing?

600
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,300
Humanities materials

601
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,260
aren't easy to memorize.

602
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,550
I'm not a photocopier.

603
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,470
The joint exam

604
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,890
has a set scope.

605
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,970
Just memorize the key points

606
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,180
within that range.

607
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,890
I believe you can do it.

608
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,300
I'm really not being modest.

609
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,930
Those materials are too hard to memorize.

610
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,600
Well...

611
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:03,810
I'll try.

612
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,300
But for me,

613
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,680
physics and chemistry

614
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,260
might as well be gibberish.

615
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,600
There's no way I can digest them

616
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,800
in such a short time.

617
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:16,730
Hey,

618
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:17,970
don't lose heart yet.

619
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,800
Mastering science subjects

620
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,600
requires learning strategies.

621
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,890
Once you get the basics,
they're easy.

622
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:32,730
Here's an idea.

623
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,100
We can help each other.

624
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,180
You teach me humanities problem-solving,

625
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,720
and I'll teach you the strategies.

626
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,300
Perfect, right?

627
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,520
But

628
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,430
what if I do poorly?

629
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,180
Will Chen Changning get mad at me?

630
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,020
Don't worry.

631
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,260
My parents might, but...

632
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,100
Just do your best.

633
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,010
Ignore them.

634
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,220
- Okay.
- Eat.

635
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:02,680
(Cafeteria)

636
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,520
Niannian,

637
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,260
what were you two talking about?

638
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,430
You didn't even invite me.

639
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,680
Nothing much.

640
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,680
Well, I'll head out first.

641
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,520
Sure.

642
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,140
Oh, bring the practice tests after school.

643
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:14,980
The milk tea shop.

644
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,300
Niannian,

645
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,260
are you and Chen Jing'an

646
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,300
studying together after school?

647
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:22,270
Yeah.

648
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,100
Don't worry too much.

649
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,890
I can study with you too.

650
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,430
Tomorrow is Saturday.

651
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,010
Let's go to the library.

652
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,470
You go ahead.

653
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,510
I've got stuff to do.

654
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:43,850
What's wrong?

655
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:45,940
Nothing.

656
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,010
You can go first.

657
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,600
I'm going to study at the milk tea shop.

658
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,760
At a milk tea shop?

659
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,260
Are you using that as an excuse

660
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,100
to hang out?

661
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,680
I really am going to study.

662
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,640
The joint exams are just days away.

663
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,260
You're going alone?

664
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,510
With Zhu Niannian.

665
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,470
I'll head over first.

666
00:35:43,219 --> 00:35:46,179
â™ªSweetness flows like honeyâ™ª

667
00:35:46,539 --> 00:35:49,699
â™ªWarm hugs rest on my chestâ™ª

668
00:35:50,429 --> 00:35:54,279
â™ªRunning together toward wild happinessâ™ª

669
00:35:54,299 --> 00:35:56,819
â™ªShining just like thisâ™ª

670
00:35:56,819 --> 00:35:59,859
â™ªEvery day is glowingâ™ª

671
00:36:00,289 --> 00:36:03,629
â™ªYour love makes me strongâ™ª

672
00:36:04,089 --> 00:36:06,979
â™ªWith you in my future,
I'm not lost anymoreâ™ª

673
00:36:06,979 --> 00:36:10,529
â™ªThis is our paradiseâ™ª

674
00:36:11,759 --> 00:36:14,829
â™ªGolden sunlight spills
on the windowsillâ™ª

675
00:36:15,279 --> 00:36:18,209
â™ªYour sweet smile is like frostingâ™ª

676
00:36:18,699 --> 00:36:21,309
â™ªEvery time you're near, my heart racesâ™ª

677
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:24,659
â™ªLove drifts through the airâ™ª

678
00:36:25,489 --> 00:36:27,589
â™ªHolding hands,
strolling under starlightâ™ª

679
00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:30,959
â™ªEvery moment is brilliantâ™ª

680
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:34,399
â™ªYour tender gaze
is a precious treasureâ™ª

681
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:38,069
â™ªI'll keep it for a lifetimeâ™ª

682
00:36:38,069 --> 00:36:41,039
â™ªSweetness flows like honeyâ™ª

683
00:36:41,429 --> 00:36:44,539
â™ªWarm hugs rest on my chestâ™ª

684
00:36:45,299 --> 00:36:49,159
â™ªRunning together toward wild happinessâ™ª

685
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:51,719
â™ªShining just like thisâ™ª

686
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:54,739
â™ªEvery day is glowingâ™ª

687
00:36:55,149 --> 00:36:58,439
â™ªYour love makes me strongâ™ª

688
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:01,899
â™ªWith you in my future,
I'm not lost anymoreâ™ª

689
00:37:01,899 --> 00:37:05,349
â™ªThis is our paradiseâ™ª
