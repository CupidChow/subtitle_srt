=Episode 6=

3
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,390
You can leave.
I'm going to the milk tea shop to study.

4
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,560
Study at the milk tea shop?

5
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,060
Are you sure this is not an excuse

6
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:20,900
for hanging out?

7
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,480
I'm really going there to study.

8
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,430
The joint exam is coming.

9
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:26,980
Are you going alone?

10
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,310
With Zhu Niannian.

11
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,270
I have to go.

12
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,180
According to the formula,
we need to do this.

13
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,560
As for the previous ones...

14
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,940
Do you get it?

15
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,850
I think I do.

16
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,550
But...

17
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,140
somehow, I'm confused.

18
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,890
Then do you get it or not?

19
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,770
I get the formula,

20
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:07,980
but I don't know

21
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,600
why we should use it.

22
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,350
It seems there are other options.

23
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,430
This one is meant to distract you.

24
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,520
You need to know the difference.

25
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,480
Don't worry. Let's look at
a few similar questions,

26
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,430
and you'll understand.

27
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,230
For example, this one
is similar to the first...

28
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,310
- Hello.
- Hello.

29
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,520
I'd like some desserts and coffee.

30
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,070
What is he doing here?

31
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,640
I only told him I'd come here to study.

32
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:55,770
I have to go.

33
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,020
You're leaving?

34
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,360
Yes.

35
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,890
We're done here.

36
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,140
I just ordered some desserts and drinks.

37
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,150
No rush to leave.

38
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,230
It's rare to see Chen Jing'an
study quietly like this.

39
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:11,690
Well,

40
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:12,980
I won't bother you two.

41
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,360
I have something else to do.

42
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:15,650
I'll only stay for a while.

43
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,310
Which part is it?

44
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,020
Chen Jing'an.

45
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,600
I'm stuck on this math question.

46
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,440
Can you help me?

47
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,290
Oh, okay.

48
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,230
Well,

49
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,560
this...

50
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,060
Is it that difficult?

51
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,860
Let me see.

52
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,020
I...

53
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,530
I...

54
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,310
I need to go to the restroom!

55
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,020
Come on, let's go together.

56
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,680
Oh, yes, together.

57
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,520
Come on, tell me
how you figured out that question.

58
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,850
If he asks me about it,

59
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,930
he'll definitely find out!

60
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,560
Why are you so nervous?

61
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,610
Didn't you

62
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,060
tell me

63
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,980
not to let Chen Changning find out

64
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,600
about our soul change?

65
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,570
Just relax.

66
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,140
I had too much milk tea.

67
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,730
I'll tell you how to solve it
when I get back.

68
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,140
(History)

69
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,440
Come on,

70
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,320
Niannian,

71
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,600
let's get back to the question.

72
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,680
The first part

73
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,480
is easy.

74
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,140
We just need to

75
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,230
use the number

76
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,770
given in the statement.

77
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,600
You're an amazing teacher.

78
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,430
I totally get it now!

79
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:31,680
I'm going home.

80
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,020
I was freaked out.

81
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,070
Tian Ye.

82
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,350
Are you skipping dinner or what?

83
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,450
No. I'm coming!

84
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,640
Almost done with this game.

85
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,600
You're always playing games!

86
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,310
Is it that interesting?

87
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,460
Since you have time,

88
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,140
why don't you go to the cinema
with Jing'an?

89
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,730
Mom, she's been busy with her studies.

90
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,230
The joint exam is coming.

91
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,320
Tian Ye.

92
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,810
Good thing you reminded me.

93
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,810
Look at your grades!

94
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,890
How dare you talk about the joint exam?

95
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,520
Murder! My mom wants to kill me!

96
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,480
Help! Dad, help!

97
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,100
I'll study! I'll study after dinner!

98
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,100
All you do is play games!

99
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,510

00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,970

102
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,470
(Soul Exchange Incident in the US)

103
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:55,650
You're back.

104
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,640
About the physics competition...

105
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,770
You said you wanted
to quit the competition.

106
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,230
I just want to confirm

107
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,100
if you've made up your mind.

108
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:14,770
Yes.

109
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,270
I've decided

110
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,020
to quit.

111
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,230
Got it.

112
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,070
Okay.

113
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,520
Now I'm thinking

114
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,330
after-school tutoring

115
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,730
is not going to work.

116
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,520
Actually, I was also trying to

117
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,100
find another way last night.

118
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,930
Great minds think alike.

119
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,100
Have you figured it out?

120
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,930
I have an idea,

121
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,060
but it's a bit crazy.

122
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,680
Don't take it seriously.

123
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,890
Go on.

124
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,980
When I have my period,

125
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,270
it hurts so badly

126
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,770
that sometimes I can't even stand up.

127
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,180
That serious?

128
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,890
I don't think I've experienced it before.

129
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,810
It'll be new to me.

130
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,520
Wait a minute. What has it got to do

131
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,100
with your period?

132
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,020
Last time, I couldn't finish the exam

133
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,730
because of this.

134
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,230
I calculated it.

135
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,100
I'll get my period
a few days before the exam.

136
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,850
If you have some cold drinks,

137
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,560
it might come earlier.

138
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,890
If it coincides with the exam,

139
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,930
you can use it as an excuse,

140
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,100
and my mom won't doubt you.

141
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,560
Wow, Niannian,

142
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,100
brilliant idea.

143
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,110
It'll definitely work.

144
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,350
But it really hurts.

145
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,100
I often get injured
when playing basketball.

146
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,180
I can endure it.

147
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,270
It's no big deal

148
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,390
for me.

149
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:58,690
By the way,

150
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,310
I also have an idea,

151
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:01,810
but it's kind of risky.

152
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,940
Do you want to know?

153
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,350
What is it?

154
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,930
Keep this between us.

155
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,270
Hui

156
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,770
wrote the physics test
for the joint exam.

157
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,040
But I heard

158
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,850
the current exam committee

159
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,520
designed exams for the Gaokao before.

160
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,770
Well, you need some updates.

161
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,890
Hui

162
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,230
is a province-level
distinguished physics teacher

163
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,180
who wrote the Gaokao papers
ten years ago.

164
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:26,810
That's impressive.

165
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,020
It's not about his experience.

166
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,730
I'm telling you this

167
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,070
because I think

168
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,520
the physics test

169
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,680
is ready.

170
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:41,850
You...

171
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,140
Are you telling me

172
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,550
to steal the paper?

173
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,520
Well,

174
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:47,970
it's not stealing.

175
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,890
We'll just have
a quick look in advance.

176
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,100
But

177
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,520
I think

178
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,960
it's inappropriate.

179
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,680
Desperate times breed desperate actions.

180
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,140
Do you want people to find out

181
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,040
about our secret

182
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,640
when they see your terrible scores?

183
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,300
But I'm scared...

184
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,500
Well,

185
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,570
if you're scared,

186
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,810
you can have Tian Ye

187
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:11,890
keep watch for you.

188
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,350
He's good at this.

189
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,350
Didn't Hui subscribe to
Science Fiction World,

190
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,510
the monthly magazine?

191
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,550
Tian Ye and I often borrowed it.

192
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:25,940
Borrow?

193
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,800
It's for study,
so it's definitely borrowing.

194
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,440
Understand?

195
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,510
(Grade 11)

196
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,060
Let's have some snacks.

197
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,220
Let me see.

198
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,640
Hey,

199
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,270
Chen Jing'an,

200
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,140
is there something you want to tell me?

201
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,470
Go ahead. I'm listening.

202
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,220
The joint exam is coming.

203
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,850
Maybe you should stop
reading comics.

204
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,720
I can't believe
you're worried about my study!

205
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,550
But last-minute efforts don't work.

206
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,350
I'll fail the exam anyway.

207
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,680
I'd rather read comics.

208
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,140
At least it makes me

209
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,720
happy.

210
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,720
I know how you can
pass the physics test.

211
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,180
How?

212
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,060
No problem.

213
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,140
Don't you need to think about it?

214
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,180
If we get caught,

215
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,050
we'll get demerits.

216
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,720
You've broken the rules for me.

217
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,180
How can I even hesitate?

218
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,600
When

219
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,050
will we do it?

220
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,090
Niannian,

221
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,020
why are you having

222
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,260
all this cold stuff?

223
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
You're about

224
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,390
to get your period,

225
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,640
and you'll get menstrual cramps.

226
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,680
The exam is coming.

227
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,510
Don't worry. It's no big deal.

228
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,470
No, you must stop.

229
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,640
Don't worry about me.

230
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,910
I really want to have it.

231
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,180
What about the exam?

232
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:40,970
I'm not worried.

233
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,930
It will definitely hurt!

234
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:43,770
Give it to me!

235
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,390
Stop eating!

236
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,350
(The Significant Implications
of the Hundred Schools of Thought)

237
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,350
The advanced ancient agriculture. First,

238
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,430
the emergence of agricultural production.

239
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,800
Second, the intensive farming
of traditional agriculture.

240
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,510
As for the advanced ancient agriculture,

241
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,050
there are several forms.

242
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,640
One, two, three, four.

243
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,480
Ms. Yu.

244
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,260
I want to go to the bathroom.

245
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,510
Okay, go ahead.

246
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,760
There are four forms.

247
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,930
The first one has an early origin.

248
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,510
Ms. Yu.

249
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,720
Back to your seat.

250
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,260
It requires two oxen to pull
and three people to operate.

251
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,350
Later...

252
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,440
Ms. Yu,

253
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,510
I'm sorry.

254
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,510
(The Big Bang)

255
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,050
I told you not to have cold food.

256
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,260
Here, hot water.

257
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,020
Thanks.

258
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:32,730
And the medicine.

259
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,050
When did you become so kind?

260
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,050
I'm going to

261
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,800
beat you fair and square this time.

262
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,600
Don't try to blame

263
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,640
your poor performance

264
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,390
on your health condition.

265
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,970
Come on, take the medicine.

266
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,190
You'll get better.

267
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,060
Thanks.

268
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,510
But

269
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,970
I think you'll definitely

270
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,640
take the first place.

271
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,050
Stop saying something like that.

272
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,430
Just try your best.

273
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,720
Go in.

274
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:27,810
I'll

275
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:28,730
keep watch.

276
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,910
Don't worry.

277
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,510
Hui is still in Class 2 right now.

278
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,190
Ms. Yu!

279
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:33,990
You freaked me out.

280
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:34,850
Hello, Ms. Yu.

281
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,760
You're from Class 1, right?

282
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,260
What are you doing here?

283
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:41,770
Well...

284
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,190
Well,

285
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,480
I'm stuck on

286
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,800
a physics problem.

287
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,720
I-I want

288
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,640
to ask Mr. Deng about it.

289
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,550
But he's not here.

290
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,050
I think

291
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,640
he's teaching a class.

292
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,470
You can ask him

293
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,390
after class.

294
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,140
Just go back.

295
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,560
Ms. Yu!

296
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,140
What's wrong?

297
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,720
Isn't the liberal arts office

298
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,680
that way?

299
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,890
I need to fetch something for Ms. Fan.

300
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,100
Ms. Yu, are you leaving?

301
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,010
I told you to go back.

302
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:44,890
Why are you still here?

303
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:47,810
That's right.

304
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:48,800
Why am I still here?

305
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,270
Then I'll go back.

306
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:31,980
Chen Jing'an?

307
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,100
What are you doing here?

308
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:36,810
Mr. Deng, I...

309
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,640
Your brother told you
about my clothes, right?

310
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,510
If you want to wear it,

311
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,760
you can come to me after class.

312
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,140
You should be studying.

313
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,010
As a good student,

314
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,010
you're not supposed to do this.

315
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,140
If I hadn't come back,

316
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:53,730
this would be stealing.

317
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,390
Don't do it again.

318
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,370
Sorry, Mr. Deng.

319
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,850
If nothing else, I'll leave now.

320
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,320
Why don't you

321
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,230
try this?

322
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,890
Well, it-it's too big for me.

323
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,010
It won't fit.

324
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,220
Goodbye.

325
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,350
Are you sure?

326
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:33,980
The joint exam

327
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,060
is just around the corner.

328
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,510
Please pay attention.

329
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,010
Your physics teacher told me

330
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,890
the electromagnetic wave concepts

331
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,010
require more review.

332
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,140
Zhang Kaiji.

333
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,060
Yes.

334
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,260
Hand out the papers

335
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,800
Mr. Deng prepared

336
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,640
for you.

337
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,520
Remember to submit them

338
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,560
after school.

339
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,850
That's a lot.

340
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:00,260
Why is there a quiz again?

341
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,140
Mr. Lin teaches mathematics.
Why does he care about physics?

342
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,260
(Physics Quiz for Grade 11)

343
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,050
We couldn't get the paper,

344
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,140
but I have to give it a shot.

345
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,930
I want to see how many scores I can get.

346
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,260
I have an idea.

347
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:16,730
What idea?

348
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,050
Change subjects.

349
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,350
Change subjects?

350
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,230
Yes.

351
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,970
You'll learn liberal arts,

352
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,180
and I'll learn sciences.

353
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,180
In that case, we can both learn

354
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,350
the subjects we're good at.

355
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,320
If we succeed,

356
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,720
we'll definitely pass the exam.

357
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,350
But...

358
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,800
No buts. Let's go to the rockeries.

359
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,680
Come on.

360
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,180
The physics exam

361
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,390
is a piece of cake for me,

362
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,180
and your mom will be satisfied.

363
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,260
Besides, many students want

364
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,300
to change subjects.

365
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,970
No one will try to stop us.

366
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,550
When our souls exchange again,

367
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,540
we can just go back
to our original classes.

368
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,140
I've come up with the explanation.

369
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,610
We'll keep crying and tell them

370
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,390
that we love our original subjects.

371
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,720
I'm not worried about

372
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,600
the aftermath.

373
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,760
If you suddenly say
you want to change subjects,

374
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,760
my mom will not agree.

375
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,260
Then I'll try to persuade her.

376
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,600
To be honest, your mom

377
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,970
is just worried about my grades.

378
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,010
If I can get good results,

379
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,550
does it matter what subject I learn?

380
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,260
But back in grade 10,

381
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,550
I was so bad at sciences.

382
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,480
How do you explain that you want

383
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,390
to change subjects

384
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,930
and you can get good results?

385
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,510
No matter what,

386
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,580
my mom won't accept it.

387
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:32,810
What should we do?

388
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,510
If we don't do this,

389
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,050
when she sees the results

390
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,390
of the joint exam,

391
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,550
she'll break down.

392
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,680
It's better to change subjects
in advance.

393
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:41,760
If I get good results,

394
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,850
she'll just accept it.

395
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,220
Niannian,

396
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,350
do it fast for less suffering.

397
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,600
If you agree,

398
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,100
I'll tell your parents right away.

399
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,100
Oh god!

400
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,930
I can't deal with it anymore!

401
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,100
What should we do?

402
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,010
God!

403
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,760
Is there anything

404
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,550
you want to tell me?

405
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,350
Dad.

406
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,350
I want to change subjects.

407
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,640
Change subjects?

408
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:37,800
I want to learn sciences.

409
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,390
But you're good at liberal arts.

410
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,720
Why do you want to change subjects

411
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,140
at this point?

412
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,300
Well, I just

413
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,430
want to learn sciences.

414
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,970
I realized I actually like

415
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,930
chemistry, biology,

416
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:54,810
and physics.

417
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,430
I love solving problems,

418
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:57,890
especially problems

419
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,600
with singular answers.

420
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,640
Are you joking with me?

421
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,640
Back in grade 10,

422
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,390
you were so bad at them.

423
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:07,690
Can you keep up?

424
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,470
Your mom won't agree.

425
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:12,930
So,

426
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,550
I'm telling you first.

427
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,350
Please help me persuade her.

428
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:17,690
Niannian.

429
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,220
I won't agree,

430
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,430
and I won't help you either.

431
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,640
You don't need

432
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,550
to talk to her about this.

433
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,140
- Dad.
- Niannian.

434
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,260
Don't act like a child.

435
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,100
Mom, let me help you.

436
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,260
Stop. You need to prepare for

437
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,350
the joint exam.

438
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,350
Don't wander around here.

439
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,020
Mom.

440
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,020
Go to your room.

441
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,480
Niannian?

442
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,640
Help me wash the dishes.

443
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,510
You wanted to tell your mom

444
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,390
about this, didn't you?

445
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,010
I wanted to try.

446
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,480
Zhu Niannian!

447
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,300
What did I tell you?

448
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,930
Your mom won't agree.

449
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,470
Don't make her angry, okay?

450
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,640
If you don't try,

451
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,300
how do you know she won't agree?

452
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:26,940
Then do it.

453
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,350
Let's see whether

454
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,720
she'll agree or get angry.

455
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,300
What are you talking about?
Change subjects?

456
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,300
I want to change subjects.

457
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,640
Mom.

458
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,850
I don't want to learn liberal arts.

459
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,350
I prefer sciences.

460
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,350
Niannian,

461
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,220
are you messing with me?

462
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,850
Do you want to drive me crazy?

463
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,050
I'm serious!

464
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,050
I really want to learn sciences!

465
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,100
If you don't believe me, you can test me

466
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,430
with a sciences paper.

467
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,300
Don't you remember how bad you were

468
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,760
at those subjects?

469
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,510
Listen up,

470
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,760
I won't agree!

471
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,390
I won't allow any teachers to help you!

472
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,430
Mom.

473
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,350
Don't call me Mom!

474
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,260
Listen,

475
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,260
my daughter would never
rebel against me like this!

476
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,140
Chen Changning.

477
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,020
I need to

478
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,510
discuss something with you.

479
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,390
I want to learn

480
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,680
liberal arts.

481
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,600
Did Chen Jing'an ask you to do this?

482
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,760
What are you talking about?

483
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,640
I'm Chen Jing'an.

484
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:12,980
Then tell me,

485
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,260
what did I give you

486
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,050
on your 6th birthday?

487
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,010
I was just a kid.

488
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,050
It's been so long

489
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,800
that I can't remember it.

490
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,480
What about last year?

491
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,350
What did Dad give you?

492
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,350
Last year...

493
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:41,050
Last year...

494
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,010
he gave me...

495
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:47,970
a phone?

496
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:55,890
Shoes?

497
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,140
A pencil case?

498
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,180
Who are you?

499
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,140
You're not Chen Jing'an.
