farewell,

my...

6
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,090
friend,

7
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,710
my lord,

8
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,960
my love.

9
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,000
We'll meet again,

10
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,380
my beloved.

11
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,410
I'll never miss a chance

12
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,830
to show you my heart.

13
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,300
Niannian?

14
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,670
Niannian.

15
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,870
Your line, Niannian.

16
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,830
I don't feel well.

17
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,170
I need to leave.

18
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,750
I can't be home late. Goodbye.

What are you looking at?

21
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,210
Nothing.

22
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,140
I... I just remembered

23
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,160
Tian Ye and Liu Yu

24
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,040
are rehearsing

25
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,080
their dance performance.

26
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,660
I wonder how it's going.

27
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,500
It'll definitely hype up the crowd.

28
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,710
Dad?

29
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,200
Why are you here?

30
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,710
I said I had rehearsal.

31
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,170
I worked overtime,

32
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,130
and it's about time,

33
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,310
so I came to pick you up.

34
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,870

Okay.

00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,590
Oh, Dad,

38
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,460
this is Chen Jing'an.

39
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,330
I always mention her.

40
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,710
Hello,

41
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,710
Jing'an.

42
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,210
Hello,

43
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,670
sir.

44
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,460
Let's hurry back.

45
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,710
Don't keep your mom waiting.

46
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,960
Let's go.

47
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,630
Missing home?

48
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,040
Any plans for dinner?

49
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,410
We'll eat out later.

50
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,380
Great.

51
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,120
Break time.

52
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,960
Let me rest.

53
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,160
So tired.

54
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:19,750
Oh god.

55
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,590
Exhausted.

56
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,830
You call that dancing?

57
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,040
Get up, get up.

58
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,130
Come on.

59
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,290
Forget the dance performance.

60
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,910
Just call it 'Wrestling Comedians'.

61
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,660
All talk, no action.

62
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,380
Liu Yu.

63
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,210
Didn't practice at home?

64
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,870
If you sit down like that
during the show,

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
you're screwed.

66
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,580
Okay, I know.

67
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,290
Just let me rest a bit.

68
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,170
I'll practice right after.

69
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,380
Tell me honestly,

70
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:57,790
were you really

71
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,460
Zhu Niannian's neighbor?

72
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,880
Of course.

73
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,330
When we were kids,

74
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,370
she'd blush
every time she called my name.

75
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,500

76
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,910
he'll be your brother-in-law.

Don't... don't talk nonsense!

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,910
I'm warning you,

79
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,040
stay away from Niannian.

80
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,670
Or...

81
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,630
Relax.

82
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,750

For festive events like this,

99
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,750
we need hosts like me

100

No idea.

118

how was your result?

00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,410
I got first place.

00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,960
Really?

126
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,410
You're amazing.

131
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,830
more than effort,

132
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,160
don't you think?

133
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,410
Congrats on becoming a host.

You barely ate anything.

141

I'm fine.

142
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,870
I just wanted a Walkman,

143
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,410
but it's too expensive.

144
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,960
Mom won't give me money,

145
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,870
so I'm saving on food.

146
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,620
I need my Walkman these days,

147
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,790
or I'd lend it to you.

148
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,250
But don't starve yourself.

149
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,840
Here's my food.

150
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,330
Take it all, suit yourself.

151
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,170
My treat.

152
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,790
Thanks, Niannian.

153
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,460
This dish looks good.

154
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,330
Let me try.

155
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,080
Sure, have it all.

156
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,000
Try the chicken leg.

157
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,840
Okay.

158
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,960
Niannian, listening to music?

159
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,040
No.

160
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,330
I keep forgetting lines,

161
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,500
so I recorded them here.

162
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,620
I listen when I'm free.

163
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,750
Don't worry,

164
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,000
you'll do fine in the play.

165
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,370
You were great

166
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,040
in last semester's recital.

167
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,460
I even picked your poem.

168
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,370
What was your original choice?

169
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,500
Bei Dao or Shu Ting?

170
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,340
I forgot.

171
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,830
Then forget it.

172
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,120
Do you rehearse privately?

173
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,170
Not anymore.

174

176
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,210
Don't worry,

177
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,460
if I really can't remember,

178
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,250
I'll sneak it onstage.

179
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,750
Listen while acting.

180
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,410
Would that work?

181
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,460
Of course!

182
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,290
But it's weird.

183
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,580
When I rehearse with Chen Jing'an,

184
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,910
I'm fluent.

185
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,660
But during performances,

186
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,250
I blank out

187
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,290
when I see Romeo's face.

188
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,080
But it's fine,

189
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,210
more listens

190
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,330
will help.

191
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,680
Let me rehearse with you.

192
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,050
We've known each other so long.

193
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,220
We're practically in sync now.

194
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,390
Everything will go smoothly.

195
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,600
I just worried you'd be busy.

196
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,470
We're good friends, aren't we?

197
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,140
Of course we help each other.

198
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,600
It's not necessary.

199
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,180
I just need to memorize my lines now.

200
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,230
Niannian,

201
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,680
why are you being so distant?

202
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,640
I'm not.

203
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:21,730
Yes, you are.

204
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,600
Before, you'd always come to me

205
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,680
when you needed company.

206
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,640
But since Chen Jing'an appeared,

207
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,640
you only go to her for help.

208
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,180
You never think of me anymore.

209
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,800
That's not true.

210
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,850
Why are you suddenly angry?

211
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,390
We're close friends too.

212
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,390
Isn't it normal if I ask her for help?

213
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,050
You're not actually mad about this, right?

214
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,760
Yes.

215
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,180
There's nothing wrong.

216
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,720
You two belong in the same world.

217
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,050
I shouldn't have squeezed between you

218
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,470
and made things awkward!

Still not done memorizing?

A few more listens and I'll have it.

Jing'an,

229
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:50,690
you've got this.

230
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,100
Gotta go.

231
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,680
I need to change costumes.

232
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,600
Okay, see you soon.

233
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,440

Up ahead.

243
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,220
let's sit here first.

244
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,640
The show's starting.

245
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,850
I need to handle

246
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:28,890
student council matters.

247
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,140
- See you.
- Alright.

248
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,470
Go ahead.

249
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,350
Okay.

250
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,890
Make sure to take lots of photos

251
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,180

252
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,640
I know, don't worry.

253
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,550
I'm a little nervous.

254
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,680
I wasn't this nervous
my first time on stage.

255
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,720
Why nervous? It's just a show.

256
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,140
Of course I'm nervous.

257
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,600
She's hosting this time.

258
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,550
I never even knew

259
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,890
she had this talent.

260
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,440
Relax,

261
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,550
don't worry.

264
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,300
you look absolutely stunning!

265
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,220
I'm at a loss for words.

266
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,800
Ms. Yu looks beautiful too.

267
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,630
Two different styles of elegance.

268
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,480
Don't you think?

269
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,890
I'm like a Western princess,

270
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:29,850
and Ms. Yu is

271
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:30,800
an Eastern princess.

272
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,640
More than just princesses.

273
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,640
You're like goddesses descended.

274
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,140
Stop, you're making me blush.

275
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,350
Ms. Yu, you really do look amazing.

276
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,140
You should wear this more often.

277
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,720
It's great for promoting

278
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,550

279
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,720

282
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:58,850
- Okay.
- Let's go.

283
00:13:58,850 --> 00:13:59,990
- Thank you.
- Go.

Let's welcome them with applause!

305
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,350
I gaze up at you in the night.

306
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,350
You appear like a mortal,

307
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,050
with awestruck eyes,

308
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,100
watching a winged angel

309
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,220
gliding on clouds

310
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,800
across the sky.

311
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,480
Romeo,

312
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,890
why must you be Romeo?

313
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,550
Deny your father

314
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,180
and refuse your name!

315
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,300
Your name alone

316
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,430
is my enemy.

317
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,800
You're not a Montague.

318
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,390
What does it matter?

319
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:12,890
It's nor hand,

320
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,220
nor foot,

321
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,720
nor arm,

322
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,850
nor any other part belonging to a man.

323
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,390
Though not a Montague,

324
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,470
you're yourself.

325
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,180
What's Montague?

326
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,140
So what does it matter?

327
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,100
Then I'll heed your words.

328
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,100
Call me but love,

329
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,220
and I'll be new baptized;

330
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,640
Henceforth

331
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:35,690
I never will be

332
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,140
Romeo!

333
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,550
Who are you?

334
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,390
Why lurk in shadows,

335
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,220
eavesdropping in the dark?

336
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,890
I know not how to tell you who I am.

337
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,970
Because it's an enemy to you.

338
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,100
If written on paper,

339
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,890
I would tear the word.

340
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,390
Yet I know the sound.

341
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,890
Are you Romeo?

342
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,600
A Montague?

343
00:17:58,890 --> 00:17:59,760
No,

344
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,390
my love,

345
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,600
if that name

346
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,550
displeases you.

347
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,640
Tell me,

348
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,350
how came you here?

349
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,930
Why risk this?

350
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,050
With love's light wings

351
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,640
I scaled these walls.

352
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,890
And what love can do,

353
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,850
I dare to follow.

354
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,390
Dawn approaches.

355
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,720
You must go.

356
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,970
If my kinsmen find you,

357
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,720
they'll murder you.

358
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,050
In your eye,

359
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,300
there lies more peril
than twenty of their swords.

360
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,640
Look at me but sweet,

361
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,480
and I am proof

362
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,430
against their enmity.

363
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,680
The lark sings your departure's call.

364
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,180
You must go now.

365
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,720
The light grows.

366
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,550
The light grows,

367
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,180
yet darker grows

368
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,550
our grieving heart.

369
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,140
Then let day in,

370
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,640
and let life out.

371
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,640
Farewell, farewell.

372
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,850
One kiss,

373
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,300
and I'll descend.

374
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,050
(Oh no,)

375
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,890
(I forgot my lines again.)

376
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,350
My lord,

377
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,390
my love,

378
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,350
my friend,

379
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,890
I need to hear from you

380
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,140
every hour of every day

381
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,470
for a minute feels like days.

382
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,100
By this count,

383
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,640
when I see

384
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,930
my Romeo again,

385
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,470
I'll have aged so much.

386
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,640
Farewell,

387
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,970
I'll never miss a chance

388
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,800
to show you my heart.

389
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,760
Then...

390
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,550
Will we meet again?

391
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,600
We will.

392
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,390
Our grief now will become

393
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,850
stories to share later.

Thanks for reminding me.

412
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,970
What's wrong?

413
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,470
My Walkman's gone.

414
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,890
I definitely put it in my bag.

415
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,100
Maybe somewhere else?

416
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,890
I just put it in my bag.

417
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:35,730
But...

418
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,550
the bag was open.

419
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,180
Someone must've stolen it.

420
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,600
Think carefully,

421
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:48,930
maybe another place?

422
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:50,970
No way, it was in my bag.

423
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,680
Calm down first.

424
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,720
How can I calm down?

425
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,640
It was a birthday gift
from my dad!

426
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,720
What kind of Walkman?

427
00:21:58,970 --> 00:21:59,890
I'll help you look.

428
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,350
I borrowed the Walkman

429
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,800
from Jing'an.

430
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,050
She emphasized

431
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,220
it was her birthday gift.

432
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,640
So I can't lose it.

433
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,600
Hello, Mr. Deng.

434
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,890
Hi.

435
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,640
- Sir, still on duty?
- Yes.

436
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,050
Bye.

437
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,550
Hi, Mr. Deng.

438
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,230
Mr. Deng,

439
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,640
you're still here?

440
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,180
I'm waiting for you.

441
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,300
Me?

442
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,140
Why is your voice hoarse?

443
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,390
I'm exhausted today and lost my voice.

444
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,430
That's heartbreaking.

445
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:49,850
This is for you.

446
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:50,890
For me?

447
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,100
Thank you.

448
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,890
Your performance today was amazing.

449
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,720
Let me try it.

450
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,680
Your stage presence

451
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,640
is flawless.

452
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:02,800
I could never do that.

453
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,050
Isn't that annoying?

454
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,390
Don't tease me.

455
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,430
It was just okay.

456
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,390
I was so uncoordinated on stage.

457
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,680
I was really nervous.

458
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,180
Who says you're not great?

459
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,220
Your sci-fi writing is incredible.

460
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,390
I especially love the character designs.

461
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,600
Really?

462
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:18,760
Then I'll...

463
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,430
try to find more inspiration

464
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:22,100
and write another one.

465
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:22,940
Great.

466
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,220
If I get ideas,

467
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,640
can I discuss them with you?

468
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:26,850
I'd really like to

469
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,180
hear perspectives

470
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,470
from female readers,

471
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:30,890
especially

472
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,180
from someone like you,

473
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,350
kind, gentle,

474
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,050
a sci-fi fan,

475
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,930
and an outstanding young teacher.

476
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,140
Okay.

477
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,010
If..

478
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,550
you write it,

479
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,640
I'll read it.

480
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:45,890
Wonderful.

481
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,850
Here, have some meat.

482
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:53,800
Eat up to grow taller.

483
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:54,890
Thanks, Mom.

484
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,300
Shasha.

485
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:00,180
Was Zhu Niannian

486
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,140
playing Juliet today?

487
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,100
Yeah, it was her.

488
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,850
She's really talented,

489
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:06,800
acted so well.

490
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,180
And the host, Chen Jing'an.

491
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,890
Has she been hanging out with you lately?

492
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,470
Yeah, why?

493
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,470
She hosted

494
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,390
like a pro.

495
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,220
What do her parents do?

496
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,930
They're doctors.

497
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,640
No wonder!

498
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:29,760
Shasha.

499
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,140
Listen,

500
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,930
they're your first social connections

501
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:33,930
in life.

502
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,970
You should stay close to both of them.

503
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,800
Niannian,

504
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,100
and also Chen Jing'an.

505
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,800
Build that relationship.

506
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,220
Later,

507
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,970
if you ever need medical help,

508
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,390
you'll have someone to rely on.

509
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,600
Look at my son,

510
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,640
a quick learner.

511
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,370
Mom.

512
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,890
Take a break from studying.

513
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:05,690
Thanks.

514
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,600
Mom,

515
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,350
you've worked hard today.

516
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,850
Get some rest early.

517
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,890
Go to sleep, you have school tomorrow.

518
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,230
Hurry up.

519
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,890
Mom, I'm sorry.

520
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,550
I swear

521
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,840
from now on,

522
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,680
I'll memorize my lines

523
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,100
for plays.

524
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,180
And I'll never do romance dramas again.

525
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,180
Please don't be mad.

526
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,220
I'm not mad at you.

527
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,230
Really?

528
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,890
That's not her angry face.

529
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:50,730
She watched the play

530
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,470
more intently than anyone.

531
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:54,890
Yeah.

532
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,140
Seeing you on stage,

533
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,100
I suddenly realized

534
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,300
my daughter

535
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,680
has grown into

536
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,140
such a young woman now.

537
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,890
You won't be with me much longer.

538
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:10,350
Mom, don't worry.

539
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,640
I'll stay with you forever.

540
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,640
You can't shake me off.

541
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,390
Okay.

542
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:16,730
Okay.

543
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,550
Shasha,

544
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,190
I know

545
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,640
you've been unhappy lately.

546
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,140
Though I switched to science courses

547
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:43,140
and we spend less time together,

548
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:44,970
you'll always be

549
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,640
my most important friend.

550
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,350
Niannian,

551
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,550
I hope we can be

552
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,140
best friends for life.

553
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,140
I got upset

554
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,600
because I thought you'd changed.

555
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,510
I get it.

556
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,220
Then promise me,

557
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,140
we'll go back to how we were.

558
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,470
Don't ditch me for Chen Jing'an again.

559
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,100
And

560
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,180
no more secrets.

561
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,350
The Walkman

562
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,800
was bought by her dad.

563
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,050
She's really upset it's gone.

564
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:11,050
She thinks

565
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:13,100
someone might be targeting me.

566
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,970
It's all my fault.

567
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,550
Don't overthink it.

568
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,970
Let Chen Jing'an

569
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:21,850
check the CCTV.

570
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,010
We'll figure it out.

571
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,970
Could something else happen?

572
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,800
I don't think students here

573
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,050
would do anything too bad.

574
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,850
Our school's a top high school.

575
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,220
If we tell the teachers,

576
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,050
they'll handle it.

577
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,600
Okay.

578
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,010
Ever since Chen Jing'an joined us,

579
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,140
we haven't spent time together

580
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,550
like we used to.

581
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,220
(It's not like we're dating.)

582
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,450
(There's no such thing)

583
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,890
(as a third person between us.)

584
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,890
Niannian, let's find Ms. Yu.

585
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,800
Instead of suspecting classmates,

586
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,220
check the CCTV to see what happened.

587
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,220
Such an official suggestion.

588
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,300
It's from Chen Changning, right?

589
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,640
Fine.

590
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,260
Shasha, go back to class.

591
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,100
Jing'an and I will go to the office.

592
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:17,970
