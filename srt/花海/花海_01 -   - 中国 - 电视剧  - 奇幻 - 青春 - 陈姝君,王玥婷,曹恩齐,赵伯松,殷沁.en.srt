1
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:23,958
Chen Jing'an

2
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:24,833
Wait for me.

3
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:27,250
Wait for me, wait for me, wait for me!

4
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,625
I said I'm not going.

5
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,750
When we play street basketball and you're not there,

6
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,000
I don't feel confident.

7
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,875
You guys are all grown men playing basketball,

8
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:34,916
and you still count on me, a girl?

9
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:37,250
Aren't you embarrassed?

10
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,916
We don't see you as just a girl.

11
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:44,208
Boy or girl,

12
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,041
look at this.

13
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,916
No girl could play with this much strength.

14
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,208
Get lost.

15
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:54,083
I have something to do today, I need to wait for Chen Changning to go back together.

16
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:55,416
Let's play next time.

17
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,458
We'll set it up next time.

18
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,583
Today's game was a disaster again.

19
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:01,500
Exactly.

20
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:08,291
Nian Nian, your writing skills

21
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:10,166
have never worried me as your teacher.

22
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:13,166
During the live competition,

23
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,416
pay attention to your pacing.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,082
And your facial expressions.

25
00:02:17,832 --> 00:02:19,500
As long as you perform as usual,

26
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,041
first place will definitely be yours.

27
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,332
Thank you, Teacher Yu.

28
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,666
I'll do my best.

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,207
Chen Changning

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,416
Did you really make plans with a friend?

31
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,332
Maybe I mixed up the North and South studios.

32
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,416
Wait here for me for two minutes.

33
00:03:39,707 --> 00:03:41,000
I'll go check over there.

34
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:42,332
Wait for me a moment.

35
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:41,040
Chen Jing'an

36
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,333
Sorry.

37
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:19,165
I...

38
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,333
Chen Changning, you’re such a troublemaker.

39
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,583
You scared someone.

40
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,833
Sorry, my fault.

41
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,250
Let me help pick it up.

42
00:05:37,415 --> 00:05:40,000
It’s okay, it’s okay. I’ll do it, I’ll do it.

43
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,040
What happened?

44
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:06,290
Chen Changning.

45
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,040
Do you have any manners?

46
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,958
Leaving already?

47
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:10,750
A whole row of bikes fell over.

48
00:06:11,165 --> 00:06:12,333
You picked up half of them.

49
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,833
I picked up a quarter.

50
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,708
Leave a quarter for the person who caused it.

51
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:16,915
That’s fair.

52
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,000
You’re clearly the one who caused it.

53
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,000
Chen.

54
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,000
I’ll take care of the rest of the bikes.

55
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,000
Thank you.

56
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:26,958
No need, really.

57
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,915
We’re all classmates.

58
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,165
We help each other.

59
00:06:30,915 --> 00:06:32,415
Let’s go home.

60
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,165
What are you doing?

61
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,290
You’re so annoying.

62
00:06:41,665 --> 00:06:42,750
I’ll go pick it up.

63
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:53,708
Oh, right.

64
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,625
The physics competition is starting this year.

65
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:56,915
I'm getting ready to sign up.

66
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,208
You're going to join the physics competition?

67
00:06:59,500 --> 00:06:59,958
Yeah.

68
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,458
The same one you won first place in last year.

69
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,290
You can't participate this year.

70
00:07:11,415 --> 00:07:12,540
What do you mean?

71
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,750
Why can you join but I can't?

72
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:16,083
You can't stop me anyway.

73
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:16,915
I'm definitely going.

74
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:18,250
Chen Jing'an.

75
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,333
The physics competition is none of your business.

76
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,333
Chen Jing'an.

77
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,500
Wait for me.

78
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,125
You're not going to sign for me, huh?

79
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,958
I'll figure something out myself.

80
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,083
Come on, sign it quickly.

81
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:51,458
But let's agree on something first.

82
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,250
Chen Changning absolutely can't find out.

83
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,040
That I forged your mom's signature.

84
00:07:55,165 --> 00:07:55,875
Hurry up.

85
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,165
If you don't tell and I don't tell, how would Chen Changning know?

86
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,625
Sign it, quick.

87
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,665
We still have to go see a movie later.

88
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,750
Why are you up so late trying to scare people?

89
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,915
Why are you back so late?

90
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:19,833
None of your business.

91
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,290
You come back late yourself and still act so tough.

92
00:08:22,915 --> 00:08:23,958
I'm still tougher than you.

93
00:08:24,165 --> 00:08:24,958
Don't talk to me.

94
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,541
Spirits of heaven and earth, hear my plea,

95
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:12,500
Immortals above, please show your power,

96
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,583
I hope I can have a chance

97
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:14,958
for Senior Chen Changning to get to know me.

98
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,416
Let me break free from Chen Changning

99
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,625
this jerk's control as soon as possible.

100
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,833
But I also want to get a little closer to him.

101
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:09,791
Chen Jing'an

102
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,291
If you don't get up now, you'll have to take the bus by yourself.

103
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:17,333
Chen Jing'an

104
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:28,625
Chen Jing'an

105
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,333
Are you getting up or not?

106
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,000
Chen Jing'an

107
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,583
Zhu Niannian

108
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,375
I'm not dreaming, am I?

109
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:47,458
Niannian, get up.

110
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:48,416
Hurry up and get changed.

111
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,125
Wear this today.

112
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,875
Change into this underwear.

113
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:01,583
What are you standing there for?

114
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,250
Come here and get changed.

115
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,333
Or you'll be late.

116
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:05,458
Hurry up and change.

117
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:06,708
Come out for breakfast as soon as you're done changing.

118
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,666
Chen Jing'an

119
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,041
Are you really Chen Changning?

120
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,291
Are you talking in your sleep because you haven't woken up yet?

121
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,125
Is this dream really that realistic?

122
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,083
Why are you acting so hysterical?

123
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,750
You're not big, but your temper sure is.

124
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,666
You should have calmed down after a whole night.

125
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,666
This breakfast is amazing.

126
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:03,416
Slow down.

127
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,125
Eat more slowly.

128
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,000
Let me tell you,

129
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,250
You have a speech contest today.

130
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,666
Don't eat too much.

131
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,916
Leave right after you finish eating.

132
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,375
Don't be late, do you hear me?

133
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,250
It's so delicious.

134
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,791
Eat slowly, see, you're choking.

135
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,083
Slow down, slow down.

136
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:44,833
Get in.

137
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:45,958
We're almost late.

138
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:53,375
Chen Jing'an

139
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,375
Did you get your period?

140
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,083
Which one?

141
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,250
No, that's not it.

142
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:02,333
Then you...

143
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,333
When did you ever sit in my car like that?

144
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,125
Why are you so jumpy?

145
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:44,166
Take your hand away.

146
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:45,541
I can't ride the bike well.

147
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:01,791
Chen Jing'an, you—

148
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:06,375
Forget it.

149
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,250
Chen Jing'an, what's wrong with you?

150
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,041
What?

151
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,708
Why are you still here?

152
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,875
I'm going to the office to find Teacher Deng.

153
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:49,708
You don't have morning reading today.

154
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:53,583
Yeah.

155
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,583
Do you still have to go to class in your dreams?

156
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:20,291
My dear big brother,

157
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,291
You scared me to death.

158
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,125
Sorry about that.

159
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,375
So, so sor—

160
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,125
Sorry for what?

161
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:29,583
Chen Jing'an, you—

162
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:30,833
Are you—

163
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,458
Are you secretly up to something?

164
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,416
Are you late because you also want to—

165
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:45,541
Teacher.

166
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,166
Tian Ye.

167
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,083
School just started not long ago.

168
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,291
How many times have you been late already?

169
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:53,875
She was late too.

170
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,708
Chen Jing'an was late too.

171
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:55,833
Why are you so biased?

172
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,875
She can make it into the top ten in the grade.

173
00:19:58,375 --> 00:19:59,625
Can you do that?

174
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,166
You never do anything proper.

175
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:03,458
Go back to class.

176
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:03,958
Got it.

177
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:04,333
Hurry up.

178
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:04,833
Okay.

179
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:05,583
Hurry up.

180
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:22,958
Teacher Yu.

181
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,583
Where is Zhu Niannian from your class?

182
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:25,500
Why didn't she come?

183
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:26,583
Zhu Niannian?

184
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,250
I haven't seen her either.

185
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:30,083
I'll go out and look for her.

186
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,166
Let another student go first.

187
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,291
You must be Zhu Niannian's mother, right?

188
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,208
We met before at the parent-teacher meeting.

189
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,250
I remember now.

190
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,375
You're Liu Xinyi's mother, aren't you?

191
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,583
So Xinyi is also participating in today's speech contest?

192
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,583
Yes, that's right.

193
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,958
But your Niannian is so outstanding.

194
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,625
It looks like our Xinyi

195
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,416
can at most get second place.

196
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,500
That's not necessarily true.

197
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,166
I think it mainly depends on their performance on stage.

198
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,708
Besides, all the kids are quite capable.

199
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,583
Whoever wins first place in the end

200
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:08,875
is really hard to say.

201
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,208
Not at all.

202
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,916
Your Niannian is the truly outstanding one.

203
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:13,833
You're too kind.

204
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,500
I already said I don't want to play basketball.

205
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,750
But you insisted on dragging me out here.

206
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,750
I'm the class monitor, and you actually made me skip class.

207
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,000
What if the student council finds out?

208
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,041
I'd be in big trouble, you know?

209
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:29,375
It's fine.

210
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,125
The Chinese teacher is a judge today, so there's no class anyway.

211
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:32,750
And who is the student council president?

212
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:33,791
Chen Changning.

213
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:34,916
What's my relationship with him?

214
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,166
Who would dare report me?

215
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,375
If Chen Jing'an said that, I'd believe it.

216
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:40,541
But you?

217
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:41,833
Forget it.

218
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:49,500
Tian Ye.

219
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,666
Isn't that Zhu Niannian?

220
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,791
Am I seeing things?

221
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,375
It looks like she's smiling at me.

222
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,416
You're not seeing things.

223
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,333
But she's smiling at me.

224
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:08,875
Me?

225
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,458
Do you guys think I look good?

226
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,166
Of course.

227
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:23,041
You look great.

228
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,208
Then do you like me?

229
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:28,916
Say it.

230
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,791
Tian Ye.

231
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,583
Isn't that Zhu Niannian's homeroom teacher?

232
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:34,333
Run!

233
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,958
Why are you running?

234
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,416
Such a big guy, but so timid.

235
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:38,541
Niannian.

236
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,250
Niannian, what are you doing here?

237
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:42,916
I've been looking for you for ages.

238
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,166
The speech contest is about to start, hurry up!

239
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:46,666
Speech contest?

240
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:47,958
What are you doing? Come on, let's go!

241
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:48,708
What is going on?

242
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:50,291
What do you mean?

243
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:54,833
Hurry up.

244
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,333
Hurry up.

245
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,416
Hurry up.

246
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:03,458
Hurry up.

247
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:06,750
Go, hurry up.

248
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,666
Go up, quick, quick!

249
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:11,458
Zhu Niannian, you can start now.

250
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:18,541
I'll speak, then.

251
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:19,916
My dream.

252
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,125
Just let me enjoy it to the fullest.

253
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:53,458
Good morning, everyone.

254
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:55,000
I'm Zhu Niannian.

255
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:56,708
You know,

256
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:59,500
the prettiest girl at Nancheng No. 2 High School.

257
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:01,458
You all probably know me, right?

258
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:10,541
The topic of my speech is...

259
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,208
Wait, what was my topic again?

260
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:18,958
It doesn't matter.

261
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,416
It's just a speech, after all.

262
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,125
I don't really know how to give one anyway.

263
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:24,875
So I'll just

264
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,625
give the school a few simple suggestions.

265
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:29,833
I think our school has quite a few problems.

266
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:31,041
First of all,

267
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:32,458
I think

268
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,208
we don't have enough time for lunch.

269
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:36,958
Isn't that right?

270
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:38,000
I...

271
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:38,916
Every day,

272
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,458
I barely get my food and haven't even taken a couple of bites

273
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:43,541
before I'm told to go back to the classroom to do homework.

274
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:47,041
Food is essential for us.

275
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:48,541
If I don't eat,

276
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,708
I'll be hungry.

277
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,708
Zhu Niannian!

278
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:52,875
If we don't eat enough,

279
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:54,666
how can we have the energy to study?

280
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:56,250
Don't you all agree with me?

281
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:00,250
What are you doing?

282
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:02,541
Also,

283
00:25:02,958 --> 00:25:04,125
some teachers always

284
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:05,708
like to take over our activity classes.

285
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:07,791
We only have two activity classes a week.

286
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:10,000
One is taken by the English teacher,

287
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:12,916
and the other by the math teacher.

288
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,333
If it's like this every day,

289
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,750
and all we do is study,

290
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:17,291
won't we turn into fools?

291
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:19,250
We need a balance between work and rest.

292
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:19,833
Right?

293
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:28,375
Principal

294
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,125
Principal

295
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:31,750
Look at yourself,

296
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:32,666
as the principal,

297
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:33,791
shouldn't you take charge?

298
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:36,541
Shouldn't you live up to your title as principal?

299
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:38,541
Work for the benefit of us students.

300
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:39,791
Zhu Nian Nian

301
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:40,875
Come down here!

302
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:47,083
Where is my teacher?

303
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,666
They let me come down.

304
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:49,958
But

305
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:52,500
I have one last suggestion.

306
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:55,625
I think

307
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:57,291
as students,

308
00:25:57,791 --> 00:26:00,583
we should have classes four days a week,

309
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:01,708
and three days off.

310
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:03,375
If you agree with me, please raise your hand.

311
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:08,750
Alright,

312
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:10,958
that concludes my speech.

313
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:16,708
Sorry.
