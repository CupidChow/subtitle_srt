A pinky promise is valid for 100 years.

(Children's Welfare Home)

4
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,850
Do you want this one?

5
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,520
They're here to adopt children.

6
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:18,650
Kid, here.

7
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,410
- Here.
- Want this?

8
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,230
Do you want new parents?

9
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,480
But uncles and aunties only like boys.

10
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,850
They don't like girls.

11
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,270
Come on, let's go over.

12
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,100
Mom, Dad.

13
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,980
- Changning.
- I want her to be my sister.

14
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,890
Dad.

15
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:36,910
Dad.

16
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,770
- What's your name?
- Slide down.

17
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,060
She actually thanked me so politely.

18
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,680
Even White Rabbit candy didn't work.

19
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,520
Was it that serious this time?

20
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,970
I made all your favorites
for breakfast today.

21
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,020
Come and eat.

22
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:35,570
You

23
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,250
are not sulking anymore?

24
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,860
You're being so nice to me.

25
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,220
Why would I sulk?

26
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,270
Come and eat.

27
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,430
You have to go to school on your own.

28
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,220
I'm going
to the direct admission seminar.

29
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,600
It's not on the way.

30
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:57,810
By the way,

31
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,470
where did you put the voice recorder

32
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,510
after using it last time?

33
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:03,770
I...

34
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:04,890
I forgot.

35
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,810
It's fine.

36
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,470
You eat and go to school.

37
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,300
I'll look for it later.

38
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,180
Are we coming home together
after school?

39
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,060
Chen Jing'an,

40
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,550
how could I possibly stay

41
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,140
at the seminar all day?

42
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,230
Hurry up and eat.

43
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,800
(He's so nice to me.)

44
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,100
What do you need?

45
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,050
What do I need?

46
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,600
You embarrassed me
in front of Chen Changning last time.

47
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,220
We haven't settled that yet.

48
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:26,760
Don't think

49
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,720
I don't see right through your tricks.

50
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,020
You can't do whatever you want

51
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,850
just because you're
Chen Changning's sister.

52
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,470
Apologize to me right now.

53
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,680
Sorry.

54
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,470
Though I don't remember what...

55
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,220
No, I mean

56
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,100
I forgot

57
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,140
what I did to upset you,

58
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,030
but

59
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,220
if it was my fault,

60
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,720
I apologize, okay?

61
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,220
What are you doing?

62
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,350
Boring.

63
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,230
Let's go.

64
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,140
Chen Jing'an,

65
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,100
are you okay?

66
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,760
I just heard you apologizing to them.

67
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,100
Are you afraid of her?

68
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,510
Does she have something on you?

69
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,560
No.

70
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,010
I just think

71
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,300
peace matters between classmates.

72
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,130
Even the queen bee
is talking about peace now?

73
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,550
I don't want to cause trouble.

74
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Still, you didn't need

75
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,970
to lower yourself and apologize.

76
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,550
It's not like you.
You're like a different person.

77
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:22,980
I...

78
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,470
It's because

79
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,930
I was too lazy to argue with them.

80
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,390
Too lazy to argue.

81
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,140
Too lazy?

82
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:39,800
She's transcended.

83
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,300
(Grade 11)

84
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,300
(Honorary Certificate)
I won the speech contest.

85
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,600
What's that got to do with me?

86
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,050
Everyone's saying you let me win.

87
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,440
Zhu Niannian,

88
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,300
why didn't you
take the contest seriously?

89
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,470
I could've won fair and square.

90
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,010
So, you're...

91
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:05,800
You're Liu Xinyi,

92
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,680
the eternal runner-up

93
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,470
I always beat?

94
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,800
Zhu Niannian,

95
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:11,730
you...

96
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,180
Who knows what Zhu Niannian is thinking?

97
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,550
If she hadn't said that nonsense,

98
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,090
the champion would definitely be hers.

99
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:19,850
Who knows?

100
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,380
Maybe she just wanted to experience
what losing feels like.

101
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,930
(Grade 12)

102
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,760
You went to the seminar today.

103
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,430
What did the principal say?

104
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,180
Any tips

105
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,050
for the interview?

106
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,060
I took notes.

107
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,020
Read them yourself.

108
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,600
He's so nice to me?

109
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,350
What does this mean?

110
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,720
(He's so nice to me.)

111
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,680
You're seeing things.

112
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,300
Today, we're going to talk
about British history.

113
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,720
We'll focus
on a famous historical figure:

114
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:46,890
Sir Isaac Newton.

115
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,010
I asked you to preview this earlier.

116
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,050
Now,

117
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,510
I'll ask one student to explain

118
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,800
Newton's most important contributions.

119
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,100
Zhu Niannian,

120
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,850
why don't you answer?

121
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,780
The three laws of motion.

122
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,600
The first law

123
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,990
is also called the law of inertia.

124
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,220
It says

125
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,350
that force is the cause of changes
in an object's motion.

126
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,680
Without an external force,

127
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,850
an isolated mass

128
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,260
will stay at rest or move
in a straight line at constant speed.

129
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,300
The law of universal gravitation.

130
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,550
It states

131
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,390
that F equals
the gravitational constant G

132
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,300
times the product of the two masses

133
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,340
divided by the square
of the distance between them.

134
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,060
Am I wrong?

135
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,010
Not exactly wrong.

136
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,050
But Niannian,

137
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,330
you should analyze Newton

138
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,010
from a historical,

139
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,300
liberal arts perspective.

140
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,300
Close enough.

141
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,680
Alright, let's continue.

142
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,100
Why did you write so much?

143
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,260
Did I write too little?

144
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:36,770
It's okay.

145
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,460
You can add
when you think of it later.

146
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:39,850
Nothing happened today

147
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,150
that you couldn't handle, right?

148
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,510
Don't mention it.

149
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,140
In the history class today,

150
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,470
the teacher suddenly asked me

151
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,600
to answer something

152
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,470
about Newton's

153
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,640
historical significance.

154
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,890
How would I know?

155
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,800
Luckily, I thought fast on my feet.

156
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:54,790
I just recited

157
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,680
Newton's

158
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:56,710
three laws of motion

159
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,240
and the law of universal gravitation

160
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,580
word for word.

161
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:00,970
I got by.

162
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,430
You're quick on your feet.

163
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,240
I wonder when we'll be able
to switch back.

164
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,930
I got by once,

165
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,350
but I can't do it every time.

166
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,930
There are lots of exams ahead.

167
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,760
I'll definitely fail
at the liberal arts exam.

168
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,800
By the way,

169
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:26,970
think carefully:

170
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,360
Did anything

171
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,430
unusual happen

172
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,800
before we switched?

173
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:34,760
- Meteors.
- Meteors.

174
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,020
Right.

175
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,400
The meteors must've changed

176
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,010
the Earth's magnetic field

177
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,850
and caused us to end up like this.

178
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,720
So, when the meteor comes next time,

179
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,800
will we

180
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,020
switch back?

181
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,350
I don't know.

182
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,720
Meteors don't come every day.

183
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,260
For now,

184
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,010
we have to play each other's roles well.

185
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,640
How's my mom doing?

186
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,390
Your mom?

187
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,470
She's still angry.

188
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,140
She barely talks to me.

189
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,600
Is your dad picking you up today?

190
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,180
Why do you look so worried?

191
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,140
Cheer up.

192
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,220
I just heard there are some punks

193
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,680
hanging around the school gate.

194
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,470
No way, who's causing trouble?

195
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,970
I heard it's Chen Jing'an.

196
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,140
What did you say?

197
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,220
Some punks are at the school gate

198
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,700
looking for trouble with Chen Jing'an.

199
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,300
Niannian, where are you going?

200
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,140
To save someone.

201
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:40,850
To save someone?

202
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,720
Niannian, wait for me.

203
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,370
Let's go, Chen Jing'an.

204
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,710
If you've got guts, come with us.

205
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,570
Don't chicken out.

206
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,100
Minqiu.

207
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,470
You're outnumbering us unfairly.

208
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,770
You should wait for me
to gather some backup.

209
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,620
It's one-on-one this time.

210
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,180
Chen Jing'an, are you scared?

211
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,470
Weren't you all tough before?

212
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,890
Why start trouble?

213
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,760
Aren't you afraid of teachers?

214
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,350
I'm not a student here.

215
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,480
What am I afraid of?

216
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,310
Li Minqiu,

217
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,680
don't go too far.

218
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,180
Chen Jing'an, you're just scared.

219
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:27,770
Scared?

220
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:28,890
Are you sure?

221
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,740
Chen Jing'an has never been scared.

222
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,270
Come on.

223
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,210
Go on.

224
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,180
We're not afraid of him.

225
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,260
You can definitely beat him this time.

226
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,590
Beat him?

227
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,250
- Beat?
- It's okay.

228
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,970
I'll cheer for you.

229
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,100
Come on, I'll give you a ride.

230
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,060
No.

231
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,180
If you ride,

232
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,430
what if you run off halfway?

233
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,140
Chen Jing'an,

234
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,690
sit on my scooter.

235
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,470
Then you sit on mine.

236
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,990
Fine. Whoever is scared is a loser.

237
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,250
Chen Jing'an, sit.

238
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,100
Chen Jing'an,

239
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,390
your friends have hyped you up so much.

240
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,850
Don't disappoint him.

241
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,130
Chen Jing'an, sit.

242
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,720
We're few but fearless.

243
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,020
Sit.

244
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,100
Sit tight.

245
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,180
(Chen Jing'an,)

246
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:40,050
(how much trouble have you caused?)

247
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,060
Niannian.

248
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,300
Don't go, Niannian.

249
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,140
It's dangerous.

250
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,760
It's dangerous.

251
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,470
I regret it.

252
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,890
I shouldn't have come.

253
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,220
Can we run now?

254
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,640
Don't be afraid.

255
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,640
Since we're here,

256
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,930
let's fight them.

257
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,640
I made a mistake last time.

258
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,140
This time, I'm winning back for sure.

259
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,510
If I don't win completely,

260
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,010
I'll change my surname.

261
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,410
We're not afraid of him.

262
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,310
Go.

263
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,800
You'll definitely win this time.

264
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,220
But I don't know how to play basketball.

265
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,430
Chen Jing'an, you're too cocky.

266
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,890
You say you can't play basketball?

267
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,640
Last time, you crushed Minqiu.

268
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:35,910
Stop talking nonsense.

269
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,220
I'm serious this time.

270
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,600
Chen Jing'an, go!

271
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,100
Minqiu will win.

272
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:51,950
Chen Jing'an will win.

273
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:54,770
Let's start.

274
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:16,770
Are you okay?

275
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,630
Li Minqiu, what are you doing?

276
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,520
Did you mean it?

277
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:21,780
I'm innocent.

278
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,100
She didn't dodge.

279
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,990
Who told you to throw it at her?

280
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:26,970
Bro, who are you?

281
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,680
It doesn't concern you.

282
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,850
Why did you throw it at her?

283
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,520
Changning,

284
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,100
you misunderstood.

285
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,100
I just didn't catch the ball.

286
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,600
He didn't mean it.

287
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,300
Since when do you hang out
with people like this?

288
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,390
What do you mean?

289
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,070
What's wrong with people like me?

290
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,510
I warn you:

291
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,300
Don't mess with my sister anymore.

292
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,010
When did I mess with your sister?

293
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,190
We were just
playing basketball together.

294
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,230
Playing basketball?

295
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,260
And she ended up like this?

296
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,300
Why don't you teach me

297
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,760
how to make your nose bleed too?

298
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,760
I'm really okay.

299
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,100
I'm really fine.

300
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,700
Chen Jing'an,
what happened to your nose?

301
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,100
Why are you here?

302
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,260
You...

303
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,190
Niannian.

304
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,240
Stop talking nonsense.

305
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,440
Let's go.

306
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,420
Li Minqiu,

307
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,000
you were the one blocking Chen Jing'an

308
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,050
at the school gate, right?

309
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,470
And you caused her nose to bleed?

310
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,800
We were just playing basketball.

311
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:45,940
Playing basketball?

312
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,010
And she ended up like this?

313
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,390
Why don't you teach me

314
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,180
how to make your nose bleed too?

315
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,220
Why do these words sound so familiar?

316
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,510
Since Chen Jing'an

317
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,350
has forgiven you this time,

318
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:00,810
I'll let it slide.

319
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,260
But don't you dare touch her again.

320
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,010
Niannian.

321
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,850
Chen Changning and the others
have gone far.

322
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,390
Let's go.

323
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,640
Hurry up and let's go.

324
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,310
Minqiu.

325
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,800
Isn't that their school belle?

326
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,220
Why is she so fierce?

327
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,260
It's because we're close.

328
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,050
When we were kids playing house,

329
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,760
we even acted as a couple.

330
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,800
Niannian, when did you become so close

331
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,640
to Chen Jing'an?

332
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,350
Do you know how dangerous it is

333
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,510
to run over like this?

334
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,630
You've said it all on the way here.

335
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,710
I know.

336
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,570
Know what?

337
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,890
You're close to Chen Jing'an

338
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,510
just because of him, right?

339
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,480
What?

340
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:46,730
Nothing, nothing.

341
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,350
I understand it.

342
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,600
Right after school,

343
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,270
the two of us and those three...

344
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,190
We were talking
about playing basketball here.

345
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,800
Chen Jing'an and I stood on this side,

346
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,660
while Li Minqiu

347
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,870
brought two people over here.

348
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,280
He was going to pass the ball to us

349
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,000
to start the game,

350
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,680
and we stood here
when the ball flew over.

351
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,720
Chen Jing'an somehow

352
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,680
didn't catch the ball,

353
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,640
and then bam.

354
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,010
It hit her nose.

355
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,220
Jing'an's nose was hit?

356
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,410
She started bleeding.

357
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,370
It's Li Minqiu's fault.

358
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,390
It's your fault.

359
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,890
I really want to slap you away
with my shoe.

360
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,300
Why blame me?

361
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,430
I didn't throw it.

362
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,220
Dad, look at Mom.

363
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,760
You failed to protect Jing'an.

364
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,970
Of course, it's your fault.

365
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,100
Your mom is right.

366
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,530
Go,

367
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,760
buy some medicine,

368
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,800
and apologize to Chen Jing'an.

369
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,010
It's already so late.

370
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,180
Are you going or not?

371
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,060
I'm going.

372
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,180
I don't know whose mom you are.

373
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,440
I'm going right away.

374
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:48,510
Buy the best
and most expensive med, okay?

375
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,430
Our daughter-in-law

376
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,470
can't get disfigured.

377
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,480
Yeah.

378
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,640
My wife's right.

379
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,640
What are you looking at?

380
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,650
What are you looking at?

381
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,020
Still looking?

382
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,520
Breast pain.

383
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,350
What's wrong with you today?

384
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,390
Just...

385
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,510
Just playing basketball.

386
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,430
Zhu Niannian was also there.

387
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,550
When did you two become so close?

388
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,270
We...

389
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,300
We just...

390
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,850
She accidentally
knocked over the bikes last time,

391
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,680
and I spoke up for her.

392
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,680
Over time, we became friends.

393
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,140
Niannian is really nice.

394
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,930
She has good grades

395
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,390
and is easygoing.

396
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,720
If you got to know her,

397
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,260
you'd definitely like her.

398
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,720
Not interested.

399
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,270
Also,

400
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,100
what's your relationship

401
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,390
with Li Minqiu?

402
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,960
Minqiu?

403
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,430
Minqiu?

404
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,760
You've never called me like that.

405
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:29,740

Got it?

414
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,140
He's obviously a punk.

415
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,470
Li Minqiu is not a punk.

Have you finished your homework?

430

I'm not important.

Do whatever you want.

432
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,720
Do whatever you like.

433
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,840
I don't have the right
to control you now.

434
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,550
I'm here to admit my mistake.

435
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,510
I promise there won't be a next time.

436
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,550
From now on,
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

437
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,050
Just don't be mad at me.

438
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,930
So, for the next monthly exam,

439
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,470
what rank

440
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,640
are you aiming for?

441
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,220
I'll get whatever rank

442
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,350
you want me to get.

443
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,390
Top ten in the grade.

444
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:31,890
No problem.

445
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,080
Next month,

446
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,430
there's also a debate contest
you must join.

447
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,510
Get a ranking.

448
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,520
I'll participate.

449
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,640
Beijing is too far.

450
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,800
Study at a local university

451
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:46,980
and live at home.

452
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,100
I'm not going to university in Beijing.

453
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,140
I'll study locally.

454
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,600
Don't lie to me.

455
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:53,770
My word is my bond.

456
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,500
Once said,

457
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,490
it cannot be retracted.

458
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,140
(Sorry, Zhu Niannian.)

459
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,010
(I need to get
through this hurdle first.)

460
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,390
Didn't I already promise you?

461
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,390
Here.

462
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,400
This was originally

463
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,010
for winning

464
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:29,850
the speech contest.

465
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,550
Is it really for me?

466
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,760
Go and try it.

467
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:43,970
What's this?

468
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,430
Medicine for your nose.

469
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,490
I didn't know which one worked best,

470
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,600
so I bought all of them.

471
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,600
When my mom heard you got hurt,

472
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,930
she immediately asked me to see you.

473
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,890
I was too lazy to go upstairs.

474
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,180
Your mom asked you
to give me all of this?

475
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,020
Right.

476
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,720
Does your nose still hurt?

477
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,780
Not anymore.

478
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,430
I don't know

479
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,760
which medicine is best.

480
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,900
So, I just bought them all.

481
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,100
This one is a spray.

482
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,100
It's easy to spray into your eyes.

483
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,850
(He's so nice to me.)

484
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,260
Just dip a cotton ball and apply it.

485
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,390
This one.

486
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,560
This is powder.

487
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,470
You need to add a little water,

488
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,600
but it's black

489
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,300
and will make you look ugly.

490
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,650
But you weren't very pretty

491
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,780
to start with.

492
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:41,970
We don't care about that,

493
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:42,850
right?

494
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,400
By the way, Chen Jing'an,

495
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,280
what's going on
between you and Zhu Niannian?

496
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,390
Why did she suddenly

497
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,430
become your...?

498
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,930
We just became friends.

499
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,010
That's great, Chen Jing'an.

500
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,040
I thought you just envied her,

501
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,000
but I didn't expect you

502
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,030
to make friends with her.

503
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,930
I have to admit.

504
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,510
You've started to look like her lately.

505
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,260
Really?

506
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,180
Of course. You even imitate her.

507
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,260
Just like this.

508
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,390
The hair flip.

509
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,140
No way.

510
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,850
Why deny it?

511
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:19,950
Why not admit it?

512
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,530
There's nothing embarrassing about that.

513
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:27,850
Chen Jing'an.

514
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:55,680
So sleepy.

515
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,140
(Oh, no.)

516
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,600
(I got caught slacking off.)

517
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,510
Why does it feel like

518
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,800
he's not throwing out trash,

519
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,970
but he's throwing out me?

520
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,010
It's so dark. You should go home.

521
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,130
Okay, I got it.

522
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,380
Remember to apply the medicine.

523
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:42,350
Say some good things later
about me to my mom.

524
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,930
I didn't come all this way for nothing.

525
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,260
Alright, I got it.

526
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,390
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.

527
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:14,940
Come here.

528
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,260
I need to talk to you.

529
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,520
