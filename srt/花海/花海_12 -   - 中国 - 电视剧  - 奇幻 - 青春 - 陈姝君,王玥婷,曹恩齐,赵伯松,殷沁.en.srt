1
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,791
I spent all afternoon thinking about it yesterday.

2
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,916
I think I was too hasty before.

3
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,375
Do you think if I apologize to Deng Shasha,

4
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:18,583
she'll forgive me?

5
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:21,333
She leaves as soon as school is over.

6
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,416
When I try to talk to her, she ignores me.

7
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:27,708
Maybe I should message her on QQ.

8
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:29,958
I'll write down everything I want to say.

9
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:31,750
I'll put "I'm sorry" in the first sentence.

10
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:33,541
She can't possibly miss it, right?

11
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:35,541
Or I could just send her a QQ message.

12
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:37,083
Let me do it.

13
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,875
What if Chen Changning sees you log into QQ at home?

14
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:41,166
Wouldn't that give us away?

15
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:54,500
Isn't that Chen Changning?

16
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:56,666
Isn't that Liu Xinyi?

17
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,083
What's going on with this world?

18
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,583
So Deng Shasha sided with Liu Xinyi before

19
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:04,875
because of my mistake.

20
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,083
Why is Chen Changning hanging out with her too?

21
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:07,791
Let's go.

22
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:08,832
Let's go see what they're talking about.

23
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,582
Maybe we shouldn't bother them.

24
00:02:10,707 --> 00:02:11,791
Let's just listen in.

25
00:02:22,707 --> 00:02:23,707
What's wrong with you?

26
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,416
Aren't you usually eager to eat?

27
00:02:26,957 --> 00:02:28,916
I had a fight with Nian Nian.

28
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:30,250
She...

29
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,000
We argued.

30
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:33,750
Didn't I tell you to

31
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:34,875
get along well with her?

32
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,291
Why did you end up fighting with her?

33
00:02:38,707 --> 00:02:39,957
I didn't do anything wrong.

34
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,125
Just go along with her.

35
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:43,541
It's your bad temper.

36
00:02:43,582 --> 00:02:44,582
How many rich people

37
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:46,041
would want to be friends with you?

38
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,957
I was hoping that when you graduate

39
00:02:48,457 --> 00:02:49,957
Nian Nian could help you out.

40
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,457
But now you've fought.

41
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,541
What if she ignores you now?

42
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,500
Let me tell you,

43
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,291
when you go to school tomorrow,

44
00:02:58,457 --> 00:02:59,750
you need to apologize to her.

45
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,541
I'm not going to apologize to her.

46
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,750
Don't be so ungrateful.

47
00:03:03,957 --> 00:03:05,791
So what if I am ungrateful?

48
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,457
Why do you always take sides

49
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,082
and assume it's my fault?

50
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:11,875
I didn't do anything wrong.

51
00:03:11,957 --> 00:03:14,332
Why should I apologize to her?

52
00:03:14,707 --> 00:03:16,875
Why am I always the one who has to put up with this?

53
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:23,832
Shasha, I'm sorry.

54
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,457
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

55
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,207
I wrongly blamed you.

56
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:38,957
Shasha, I'm sorry.

57
00:03:39,457 --> 00:03:40,500
As your good friend,

58
00:03:40,957 --> 00:03:42,250
I shouldn't have doubted you.

59
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:43,541
Can you forgive me?

60
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,250
Hello,

61
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,625
the number you dialed

62
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:10,875
is currently busy.

63
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:11,875
Please try again later.

64
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,083
Hello?

65
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,625
She deleted both of us from her QQ.

66
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,500
She doesn't reply to texts or answer calls.

67
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,915
Maybe she hasn't checked her phone.

68
00:04:35,415 --> 00:04:36,208
Chen Jing'an.

69
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,333
How could she not have seen it?

70
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,915
She just hung up right away.

71
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,083
Let me tell you,

72
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,458
if not, tomorrow we should

73
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:45,625
drag her to the rock garden.

74
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,333
Hold her there and have a proper talk.

75
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,083
Forcing her isn't a good solution.

76
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:50,540
Let's think of another way first.

77
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,665
To help Shasha calm down.

78
00:04:52,915 --> 00:04:54,915
So how can she calm down?

79
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,250
We can't just

80
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,000
tomorrow

81
00:04:57,415 --> 00:04:58,875
I climb over her wall to her house

82
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,165
and let her beat me up and yell at me.

83
00:05:00,915 --> 00:05:02,083
Don't be impulsive.

84
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:03,625
Just get some rest tonight.

85
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:04,915
We'll figure something out tomorrow.

86
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:07,750
Alright then.

87
00:05:08,165 --> 00:05:08,708
Then you

88
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:09,750
should get some rest early too.

89
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,500
Tomorrow, try to talk to Chen Jing'an again.

90
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:17,833
Don't lose your composure.

91
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,165
There's still plenty of time ahead.

92
00:05:21,915 --> 00:05:23,208
You'll have a chance to explain everything.

93
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,208
If you're real friends,

94
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,333
Deng Shasha will understand you.

95
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,000
So get some rest early.

96
00:05:33,915 --> 00:05:34,708
Chen Changning.

97
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,083
Today,

98
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,333
I saw you with Liu Xinyi.

99
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,708
Was there something going on between you two?

100
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,290
Nothing was going on.

101
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:09,708
Niannian

102
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,165
You're still not asleep?

103
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,750
I can't fall asleep.

104
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,290
What's wrong?

105
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:19,958
Dad,

106
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,250
Can you

107
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,125
tomorrow morning

108
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,040
take me to the mall first

109
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,708
to buy a Walkman?

110
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,708
And then go to school?

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,833
A Walkman?

112
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,375
Don't we already have one at home?

113
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,333
It's broken.

114
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,875
I had a falling out with my classmate.

115
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,000
We had a disagreement.

116
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,915
I want to buy one to apologize to her.

117
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,165
I see.

118
00:06:38,415 --> 00:06:39,000
Alright.

119
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,540
Then let's go buy it early tomorrow.

120
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:42,790
Niannian,

121
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,000
between friends,

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,583
it's normal to have arguments.

123
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,415
Don't blame yourself too much.

124
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:49,500
The most important thing is

125
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,125
to understand each other.

126
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:52,165
Clear up

127
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,333
any misunderstandings.

128
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:55,625
Thanks, Dad.

129
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,500
Nian Nian, why did you come so early?

130
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,500
I came here on purpose to wait.

131
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,458
I thought about it for most of last night.

132
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:21,875
I finally figured it out.

133
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,250
A way to make Shasha forgive me.

134
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,083
Hasn't she always wanted one?

135
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,833
I bought it especially to give her as an apology.

136
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:29,750
That's sincere, right?

137
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:32,790
It should work.

138
00:07:32,915 --> 00:07:33,458
When the time comes,

139
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,000
you can also

140
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,583
say a few nice things to cheer her up.

141
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:36,750
Shasha is easy to talk to.

142
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,875
No problem.

143
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,875
I'm the best at comforting people.

144
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,583
It's this Walkman, right?

145
00:07:45,915 --> 00:07:47,125
Your dad paid for it.

146
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,500
Once I switch it back,

147
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:50,375
I'll return it to you.

148
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:50,958
No need.

149
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,208
I'm spending your family's money now anyway.

150
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,790
Deng Shasha is here.

151
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,625
Shasha.

152
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,875
What do you want?

153
00:08:14,415 --> 00:08:15,208
Shasha.

154
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,250
About before,

155
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,958
I misunderstood you.

156
00:08:20,415 --> 00:08:21,208
I apologize to you.

157
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:26,083
Before, you

158
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,790
always wanted to buy a Walkman, right?

159
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,125
I bought a new one just for you.

160
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:29,915
As an apology.

161
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,458
Please don't be mad anymore, okay?

162
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:36,833
What do you mean?

163
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,708
Are you pitying me?

164
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:39,791
Shasha.

165
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,625
Niannian didn't mean it like that.

166
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,291
She just wants to apologize to you.

167
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,916
She's apologizing to me, why are you butting in?

168
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:47,875
Does this have anything to do with you?

169
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,083
Shasha.

170
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,500
I'm sincerely apologizing to you.

171
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:58,208
I don't need it.

172
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,083
Take the Walkman back too.

173
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,333
Niannian.

174
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,250
You don't understand me at all.

175
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,375
You're a little princess who looks down on everyone.

176
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,791
Maybe in your eyes,

177
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,250
a Walkman

178
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,416
is enough for me to forget all the unpleasant things.

179
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,333
But what I really want

180
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,708
you have no idea.

181
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,208
You did nothing wrong.

182
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:36,625
I'm the one who was wrong.

183
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:39,625
I shouldn't have

184
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,291
thought I could

185
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,416
be friends with you as equals.

186
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:40,166
Senior

187
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,166
You're here.

188
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,041
This is the speech draft I revised yesterday as you requested.

189
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,416
I revised it again.

190
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:46,500
Take another look.

191
00:10:58,791 --> 00:10:59,708
You're very talented.

192
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,791
And you work hard.

193
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,250
I can see it all.

194
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:04,708
Senior

195
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,791
Do you really know me that well?

196
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,125
Actually, I know a lot about you.

197
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,291
Really.

198
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,125
Senior

199
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,666
What do you know about me?

200
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,125
For example,

201
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,000
your Walkman.

202
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,583
What Walkman?

203
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:30,875
I...

204
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,041
I don't know.

205
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,875
You know what I'm talking about.

206
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,208
I've already watched the surveillance footage.

207
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,250
So you approached me because of Zhu Nian Nian.

208
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,250
That's why you got close to me, right?

209
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,125
I was actually really curious.

210
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,208
Why would you even notice me?

211
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,541
I'm not as pretty as she is.

212
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:54,666
So in your eyes,

213
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,333
being good-looking means everyone pays attention to you,

214
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,250
and if you're not, no one cares?

215
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,541
Isn't that true?

216
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,375
I'm just as capable as Zhu Nian Nian.

217
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,416
But why does the teacher always notice her

218
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,125
and never see my hard work?

219
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,666
Every time,

220
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,125
no matter what opportunity comes up at school,

221
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,166
it's always Zhu Nian Nian's.

222
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,125
No one else even gets a chance to compete.

223
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,291
Isn't it just because she's pretty?

224
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:15,416
So you tried to hurt

225
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:16,750
Zhu Nian Nian to vent your anger.

226
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:17,958
Yes.

227
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,708
I watched her rehearsal.

228
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,458
She messed up her lines completely.

229
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,916
If she hadn't relied on the recording in her Walkman,

230
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,458
she wouldn't have been able to perform at all.

231
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,083
But just because she's pretty,

232
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,583
the teacher still let her perform.

233
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:29,916
Why?

234
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,291
That's right.

235
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,833
I did take her Walkman on purpose.

236
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,416
I wanted her to embarrass herself in front of the audience.

237
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:37,541
So did she embarrass herself?

238
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,750
Turns out, even without the Walkman,

239
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,833
she still performed smoothly.

240
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:43,708
Besides, before she went on stage,

241
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,208
she wasn't even planning to use the Walkman.

242
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:52,291
Yes.

243
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,000
She is indeed good-looking.

244
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,916
But you only focus on her looks.

245
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,500
You ignore her hard work.

246
00:12:58,708 --> 00:12:59,708
You attribute all her success

247
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,958
to her being attractive.

248
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,375
In fact, subconsciously,

249
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,041
it's just to lessen your own sense of failure.

250
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,625
So you can justify being jealous of her.

251
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,333
I'm jealous of her?

252
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,541
How could I possibly be jealous of her?

253
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:11,500
You're not jealous of her?

254
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,541
Then why do you care so much about her?

255
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,583
Is it because she's good-looking

256
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,833
that she got certain opportunities?

257
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:23,083
The reason why I

258
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,666
didn't make things clear to you from the start

259
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:26,500
was because I wanted to see

260
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,208
if you were truly worth my time and effort

261
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,541
But after interacting with you a few times

262
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,125
I realized you are an outstanding

263
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:34,625
and very hardworking student

264
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,750
In fact, you are not inferior to Zhu Niannian at all

265
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,000
You just put yourself

266
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,375
into the mindset of wanting to defeat Zhu Niannian

267
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,708
which is a mistaken way of thinking

268
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:44,416
But what you don't realize is

269
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,708
in many ways, Zhu Niannian is not as good as you

270
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,541
For example, this speech draft

271
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:52,333
Liu Xinyi

272
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,416
you are a truly outstanding person

273
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,791
You should set higher goals for yourself

274
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,625
Become someone who doesn't need to care about appearances

275
00:13:58,625 --> 00:13:59,875
to earn opportunities

276
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,166
I'm telling you all this today

277
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:06,875
first, because I genuinely admire your excellence

278
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,041
second, because Teacher Yu asked me to

279
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:12,416
She said that in her eyes

280
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,833
you have always been an outstanding student

281
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,000
with excellent grades

282
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:18,625
and a responsible attitude towards your work

283
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,916
even more reassuring than Zhu Niannian

284
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,750
The reason I'm the one telling you this

285
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,500
is because she worries that her position as a teacher

286
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,250
might put too much psychological pressure on you

287
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,083
So don't keep making the same mistakes

288
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,541
and disappoint the teachers who care about you

289
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:35,541
And don't let yourself

290
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,083
be ruined by jealousy of others

291
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:38,375
Alright?

292
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:45,666
You can do it.

293
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,166
Can you forgive me?

294
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,791
About this matter,

295
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,458
the one who got hurt the most is Shasha.

296
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,791
If you want to apologize, you should go to her.

297
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,083
If you can get her forgiveness,

298
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,833
we won't report this to the teacher.

299
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,000
All of these are for me?

300
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,875
Why didn't Ji Wenting come?

301
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,291
You eat first.

302
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:37,708
I have something

303
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:38,625
I want to tell you.

304
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:39,750
What is it?

305
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:43,375
Actually,

306
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,083
actually, the Walkman

307
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,958
was put on your desk by me.

308
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,333
And the photo on the forum

309
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:52,541
was also me.

310
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,916
What did you say?

311
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,125
Why did you do that?

312
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:02,375
I'm sorry, Shasha.

313
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,916
I was too jealous of you and Zhu Niannian at that time.

314
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,583
I wanted to make you two have a conflict.

315
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,750
That's why I did it.

316
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,375
But now I really know I was wrong.

317
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:11,750
Can you forgive me?

318
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,958
So all the times you were nice to me before were fake?

319
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,000
You just treated me like a clown.

320
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,125
Was it all just a game to you?

321
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,750
I really know I was wrong.

322
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:29,500
You know you were wrong,

323
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,541
so I have to forgive you?

324
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:31,833
When each of you apologizes,

325
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:32,833
why do you all act

326
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,333
like you're the ones who have been wronged?

327
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:35,708
I clearly didn't do anything wrong.

328
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,708
Why does everything

329
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,000
have to be my responsibility?

330
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:39,625
Shasha.

331
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,041
Shasha.

332
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,708
I don't want your fake sympathy.

333
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:01,458
I'm sorry.

334
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,541
Why don't you trust me?

335
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,500
Why?

336
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,916
Am I really that untrustworthy?

337
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,708
I will never forgive you again.

338
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,083
Happy National Day

339
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:38,083
Nian Nian

340
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:39,750
Where are you planning to go for National Day?

341
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:41,958
I haven't decided yet.

342
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,583
I want to go somewhere farther away.

343
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:44,333
But

344
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,375
my mom definitely won't let me.

345
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:47,666
Tian Ye

346
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:48,583
What about you?

347
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:51,833
I want to go to a place

348
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,541
with mountains,

349
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:54,791
with water,

350
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:55,791
where I can fish,

351
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,208
and climb mountains.

352
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:58,791
Most importantly,

353
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:00,500
the scenery has to be good.

354
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:04,708
Then do you guys want to

355
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,083
go to my family's farmhouse?

356
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,291
You can't climb mountains there,

357
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:09,625
but there's water,

358
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:10,750
you can fish,

359
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,125
and you can have barbecue.

360
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:13,041
Really?

361
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,541
Are you guys going or not?

362
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
If Nian Nian goes, I'll go.

363
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,208
I...

364
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:25,708
I'll go.

365
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,416
Tian Ye

366
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,041
Can you invite Chen Jing'an?

367
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:33,375
Even better,

368
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,375
if Chen Jing'an's brother can come too.

369
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,791
You're a fanboy of Chen Changning, huh?

370
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,875
Chen Changning is such a good student.

371
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,125
He's the person I admire the most.

372
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,250
Whether Chen Jing'an and Chen Changning go

373
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:52,916
is all up to you.

374
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,250
Don't get handsy.

375
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,166
What plans do you have for National Day?

376
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:03,291
Tian Ye said

377
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,583
he wants to go to the agritourism place Liu Yu's family runs.

378
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:05,375
Are you going?

379
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,916
I...

380
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:08,500
Come on, go.

381
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,083
It's rare to have time off during National Day.

382
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:10,958
Invite Chen Changning to come along too.

383
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,166
Chen Changning is coming too?

384
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:14,833
Ask him.

385
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,083
I don't know if he'll go or not.

386
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,166
Okay.

387
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,125
I'll ask him when I get home tonight.

388
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,875
What about Deng Shasha?

389
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,000
Ask her if she's going.

390
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,125
I don't know.

391
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,125
She seems like she doesn't really want to talk to me.

392
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:27,333
Why?

393
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:28,375
Didn't we

394
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,333
already clear up the misunderstanding before?

395
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,000
Shasha.

396
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:35,791
Nian Nian.

397
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:36,750
Why are you here?

398
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,083
We were just about to look for you.

399
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,583
We're going out together for National Day.

400
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,708
You have to come with us.

401
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:44,875
I'm not going.

402
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,500
You're not still mad at me, are you?

403
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,750
Didn't we already cry together?

404
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,125
I'm not mad at you anymore,

405
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:55,375
but I need to think about

406
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,666
whether or not to forgive you all.

407
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,250
You guys have fun.

408
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,375
She clearly isn't mad at me anymore,

409
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,250
so why hasn't she forgiven me?

410
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,208
You girls' thoughts

411
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,500
are just too hard to figure out.

412
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,250
This really hit her hard.

413
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,875
Let her have some quiet time.

414
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:26,583
Nian Nian,

415
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,500
Hasn't it been a long time since the two of us

416
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,666
went shopping together?

417
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:30,666
It's just right,

418
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:31,625
since you're on holiday,

419
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:32,916
we can really relax.

420
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:34,291
Mom,

421
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:35,833
during the National Day holiday,

422
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:36,875
my classmate invited me to

423
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,125
visit their family's agritourism place.

424
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,250
That counts as relaxing, right?

425
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,416
Can I go?

426
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:41,958
Where is the agritourism place?

427
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,541
It's in the countryside on the outskirts.

428
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:45,208
It's not far.

429
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:45,750
By car,

430
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,708
it's only about an hour.

431
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:47,458
So, are you

432
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,666
coming back that same night?

433
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:50,958
Coming back that night would be too rushed.

434
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,791
We plan to stay overnight and come back the next day.

435
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,833
You're a girl,

436
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,541
isn't it unsafe to stay out?

437
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:58,791
I think you shouldn't go.

438
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,375
How about Mom takes you out to have fun instead?

439
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,375
They're all classmates, it won't be dangerous.

440
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,333
Besides, it's a newly opened scenic spot.

441
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:06,916
Not many people go there during National Day.

442
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,500
Just let me go, please.

443
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,541
My classmate finally invited me for once.

444
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,166
If I don't go, they'll be so disappointed.

445
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,125
Are they all boys or girls?

446
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:19,583
Of course they're girls.

447
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:21,750
You've met Chen Jing'an, right?

448
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,250
And Liu Yu.

449
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,083
You don't know her.

450
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:24,041
Liu Yu?

451
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:24,958
Yeah.

452
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,500
A boy definitely wouldn't have that name, right?

453
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,000
Just let me go, please.

454
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,208
Alright, alright, alright.

455
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,333
Since they're all your classmates, you can go.

456
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:39,791
But be careful.

457
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:40,458
Did you hear me?

458
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:41,333
Don't worry.

459
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:45,166
The clothes in this shop are nice.

460
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,291
Let's go in and have a look.

461
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:47,375
Let's not buy anything.

462
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:48,500
I already have a lot of clothes.

463
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,375
Alright, let's just go in and take a look.

464
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:53,000
Ningning

465
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,375
Your aunt is already downstairs.

466
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:55,083
I'll go pick her up.

467
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:55,958
I'll go too.

468
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,458
No need, I can go by myself.

469
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,541
Ningning

470
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:01,875
Your aunt coming this time

471
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:03,416
she must be especially concerned about your grades.

472
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,291
She cares even more than I do as your mother.

473
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:07,208
This shows

474
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:08,958
your brother and your aunt have a good relationship.

475
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:13,458
An'an

476
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:14,958
For your trip this time,

477
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:16,583
have you packed everything you need?

478
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,333
Be sure to remember the insect repellent.

479
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,041
Everything's ready, Mom.

480
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:21,833
You don't need to worry.

481
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:23,666
When are you leaving?

482
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,500
We'll go after having lunch with you.

483
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:30,125
Ningning

484
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:32,666
I remember you don't really like going to the countryside.

485
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,083
Why are you so happy this time?

486
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:36,916
I can't let Chen Jing'an go alone.

487
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,083
That's true.

488
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,875
It's good for siblings to look out for each other.

489
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,500
It's fine, Mom.

490
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,916
There are several classmates going too.

491
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:45,375
We'll all look out for each other.

492
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:46,916
You've grown up.

493
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:50,875
Come in, sis.

494
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,500
Sis, you're here.

495
00:23:58,375 --> 00:23:58,958
Changning

496
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:00,125
Come, give me a hug.

497
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,500
We haven't seen each other for half a year.

498
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,291
Changning has grown taller again.

499
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:09,375
Isn't that right?

500
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:10,958
How have your studies been lately?

501
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:11,750
Not bad.

502
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:12,500
Auntie.

503
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:13,833
Please have a seat first.

504
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:15,708
Auntie.

505
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,666
Our Changning,

506
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,250
is getting more and more handsome.

507
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:29,916
An'an.

508
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,666
Come here.

509
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,291
Look.

510
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:32,666
Auntie brought you lots of

511
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:33,291
gifts.

512
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:34,250
Go on.

513
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:35,083
Go pick one.

514
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:37,375
That's right.

515
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,291
Come over here, quickly.

516
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,750
Those are all for Changning.

517
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:42,000
Don't share them with me.

518
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:53,166
Let's go.

519
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:08,750
Sister.

520
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:10,416
How can you say that?

521
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:11,750
An'an.

522
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:13,375
No matter what,

523
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:15,791
she's still our child.

524
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:18,875
How can an adopted one count as a real daughter?

525
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:20,916
You all can treat her as your own daughter,

526
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:21,916
but I can't do that.

527
00:25:21,916 --> 00:25:23,250
Or treat her as my real niece.

528
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:30,916
Chen Jing'an was adopted.

529
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:32,708
Yes.

530
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:35,583
She is the daughter our parents adopted.

531
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:40,875
Does Chen Jing'an know about this?

532
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,166
I've never heard her mention it.

533
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,541
She knows.

534
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,583
Although she seems carefree on the surface,

535
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:52,916
she actually cares a lot about it deep down.

536
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:55,666
She rarely talks about it with others.

537
00:25:57,375 --> 00:25:58,041
I originally didn't intend

538
00:25:58,041 --> 00:25:59,375
to tell you about this.

539
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,708
But Aunt,

540
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:05,416
Aunt has never liked Chen Jing'an.

541
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:12,375
Chen Jing'an must be very sad.

542
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:16,458
Sister,

543
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:18,750
Even if you don't like An'an,

544
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,291
could you not make it so obvious?

545
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:22,916
That's really hurtful.

546
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,208
I feel sorry for Changning.

547
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,458
But I can't show it.

548
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,625
You know, clearly Changning

549
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:27,833
is your biological son,

550
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:30,291
yet you have to split your attention

551
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:32,083
with someone who isn't related by blood.

552
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:34,208
Isn't that unfair to Changning?

553
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:35,958
Sister,

554
00:26:36,666 --> 00:26:38,291
An'an is our daughter now.

555
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:40,416
Whether by birth or adoption,

556
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,000
as long as they're our child,

557
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:43,875
we'll treat them both equally.

558
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:47,000
Changning and his sister have a great relationship.

559
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:48,708
If you act like this,

560
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:50,500
Changning will feel bad too.

561
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:52,958
I just care about my own nephew.

562
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:54,666
Is that wrong?

563
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:57,958
You guys...

564
00:26:57,958 --> 00:26:59,041
You're leaving already?

565
00:26:59,333 --> 00:26:59,875
Yes.

566
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:01,375
We've made plans with our classmates.

567
00:27:01,958 --> 00:27:02,625
Wait for me a moment.

568
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:03,791
I'll go get my bag.

569
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:05,083
Where are you going?

570
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:07,875
Aunt,

571
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,208
Chen Jing'an and I are going on an outing.

572
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:11,750
So we won't be joining you for dinner.

573
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:21,666
An'an

574
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:23,541
Have fun!

575
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:24,500
Okay.

576
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:27,250
Dad.

577
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,250
Mom.

578
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,541
We're heading out now.

579
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,041
Let's go.

580
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:35,000
An'an.

581
00:27:35,416 --> 00:27:36,458
Have a good time!

582
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:40,875
Oh, my sister.

583
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:42,708
You saw that, right?

584
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:44,083
Those two kids,

585
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:46,416
they definitely left early because they felt awkward.

586
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:48,208
Alright, alright.

587
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,000
It's all my fault, okay?

588
00:27:59,416 --> 00:28:00,625
There's really a train.

589
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,041
Is that a real train?

590
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,166
We'll know once we go up and take a look.

591
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:06,500
Where's Liu Yu?

592
00:28:06,708 --> 00:28:07,791
Wasn't he coming to pick us up?

593
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:10,000
He's here.

594
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:14,750
You're all here.

595
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:16,541
Come on, let's go to my family's restaurant.

596
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:17,291
Let's go.

597
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:18,875
Let's go, to my family's restaurant.

598
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:20,333
It's so hot, let's hurry up and go.

599
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,083
Liu Yu.

600
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,916
Is there anything else fun around here?

601
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,541
There are fun things everywhere here.

602
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:35,375
I can be your tour guide.

603
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,291
Sure!

604
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:38,250
Thank you.

605
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,125
Thanks.

606
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:50,333
Why does Chen Changning get a room to himself?

607
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:51,375
I have to squeeze in with Tian Ye.

608
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:53,041
I want to switch with Chen Changning.

609
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:53,916
I want a room to myself.

610
00:28:54,291 --> 00:28:55,833
There aren't enough rooms, that's why.

611
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:57,750
Just make do for now.

612
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,708
Enough.

613
00:28:59,708 --> 00:29:01,708
Chen Changning is Liu Yu's idol.

614
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:03,666
He has the right to special treatment.

615
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:05,083
If you can, try getting first place in the whole school too.

616
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:06,875
You're the last in the class and you're talking about me?

617
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,666
We're both the same.

618
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,416
Right back at you.

619
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:10,750
That's enough.

620
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,083
What are you two arguing about?

621
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,250
Does it really matter where you stay?

622
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:13,958
Yeah, that's right.

623
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:15,500
Liu Yu, just ignore those two.

624
00:29:15,708 --> 00:29:16,875
Hurry up and take us somewhere fun.

625
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:17,791
Sure!

626
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,708
There's a wishing tree nearby.

627
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,666
You can even go fishing by the river.

628
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:22,958
When I was little,

629
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:24,458
my dad used to take me there a lot.

630
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,333
Your dad is really good to you.

631
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:28,250
All my dad does is give me money.

632
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:30,000
And every time, my mom takes it away.

633
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:31,125
You should be grateful.

634
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:32,458
Having a mom is already a blessing.
