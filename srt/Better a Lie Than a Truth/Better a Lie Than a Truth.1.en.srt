Congratulations, you've cleared this successfully.

00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,398
Much gratitude to President Qiao Musheng from Damang Entertainment

4
00:01:02,398 --> 00:01:06,800
for bringing a wonderful display of the new escape room theme to this press conference.

Thank you all for coming to witness the release of our new escape room theme.

9
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,752
Mr. Qiao, it has been a long time.

10
00:01:57,752 --> 00:02:00,730
I'm Su Nian, do you remember me?

11
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,750
Could you please do an interview with us?

12
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,260
Mr. Qiao!

13
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,939
- Hello, Mr. Qiao!
- Hello, Mr. Qiao!

14
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,348
Hi, Mom.

15
00:03:16,348 --> 00:03:19,500
Xiao Nian, I want some puffs.

16
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,473
Okay, I'll get some for you.

17
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,400
Mr. Qiao, Lu Jingnian's smile is a little stiff.

18
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,950
Your brow ridge needs to relax a little more to truly express the emotion of joy.

19
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,800
Also, Mr. Qiao, you should have shown a bit more sympathy for this fish.

20
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,980
I'll practice some more.

21
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,770
I've accepted the invitation to the cocktail reception tonight.

22
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,200
I know wine is off-limits for you.

23
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,000
You get drunk even off one sip. But I already promised them.

24
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,900
Deal with it. I'm not going.

25
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:09,080
That Su Nian from last time is still asking for an interview.

26
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,170
She keeps sending emails, and I've already rejected her.

27
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,330
Mr. Qiao, it has been a long time.

28
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,050
What trouble...

29
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,820
She asked you to meet with her at the cocktail reception.

30
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,570
She's quite resourceful at getting information.

31
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,740
Then I'll deal with her once and for all.

32
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,350
Mr. Qiao, where are you going?

33
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,750
To the cocktail reception.

34
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,150
- All right. This way, please.
- Thank you.

35
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,800
I'm sorry. I originally wanted to let you have this invitation.

36
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,200
But in light of the fact that you lose it every time you drink,

37
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,150
I came on your behalf.

38
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,600
If you really wanted to be nice, then give me the opportunity to take the training course.

39
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,300
After all, I have given in to you enough growing up.

40
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,700
If I let you have it, wouldn't that be pitying you?

41
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,900
You really should be.

42
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,600
You're the kind of person that digs up people's privacy without feeling ashamed. All for page views.

43
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,000
You really shouldn't be so stubborn.

44
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,700
The opportunity to meet Mr. Qiao today is mine.

45
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,685
Hurry on back.

46
00:05:11,423 --> 00:05:12,823
You!

47
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,920
You came.

48
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,370
Yunduan?

49
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,550
I thought you said that you weren't coming.

50
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,370
Su Nian said that she was coming.

51
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,220
Can my fiancée come in with me?

52
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,110
Yes, please.

53
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,500
Let's go.

54
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,720
Nian Nian. Nian Nian!

55
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,960
This is your Mojito.

56
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,040
- Thank you.
- Alcohol-free.

57
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,718
You two are getting married tomorrow.

58
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,420
But weren't you just friends?

59
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,870
The difference between a friend and a boyfriend is just one word.

60
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,710
Nian Nian.

61
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,050
Nian Nian?

62
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,140
Stop worrying. I'll go get you some food.

63
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,750
Editor Su, Mr. Qiao has arrived at the cocktail reception.

64
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,710
You can do the interview directly.

65
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,000
Stop searching! Stop searching!

66
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,240
You're getting married tomorrow, the interview doesn't matter.

67
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,900
Congratulations.

68
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,630
We are friends, no need to be so formal.

69
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,760
I have already sent Miss Su the interview notice.

70
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,807
Didn't you say that you were going to turn her down? Why send her the notice?

71
00:07:03,807 --> 00:07:07,050
Only by rejecting her after giving her hope

72
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,550
will she finally give up all hope.

73
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,132
Miss Su.

74
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:21,299
Mr. Qiao.

75
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,030
Mr. Qiao!

76
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,080
Qiao Musheng, I'm sorry!

77
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:44,865
Back then, on the love letter you wrote me,

78
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:47,000
I marked out all those typos,

79
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,050
but I didn't mean to let everyone see it!

80
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,940
I'm sorry!

81
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,110
Miss Su.

82
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,670
- Who are you?
- Miss Su, come on.

83
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,700
Let's not do this.

84
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,400
Qiao Musheng! Qiao Musheng!

85
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,600
I'm sorry! I said I'm sorry!

86
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,400
- It's okay.
- Hurry, hurry.

87
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,950
Take it easy. Take it easy!

88
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:09,070
Qiao Musheng! I'm sorry.

89
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:13,080
Back then, I wasn't thinking about it clearly.

90
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,910
Last night... I also wasn't thinking about it clearly.

91
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,410
I...

92
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,400
Mr. Qiao! Why don't you let me do an interview with you?

93
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,280
I'll definitely publicize your escape room with all my effort.

94
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,350
Mr. Qiao! Just give me a few minutes.

95
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,870
Mr. Qiao.

96
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,310
Mr. Qiao?

97
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,401
You might find it hard to accept what I'm about to say.

98
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:57,700
I'm not Qiao Musheng.

99
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,600
I'm his little brother, Lu Jingnian.

100
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,160
I went to the cocktail reception in his name.

101
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,100
You've made a mistake.

102
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,220
Lu Jingnian?

103
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,850
I knew he had a twin brother.

104
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,800
But weren't you abroad?

105
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,813
I came back a while ago.

106
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,400
Mr. Qiao, stop joking!

107
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,580
I know that you are still upset about that thing that happened back then─

108
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,680
That thing from back then...

109
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,200
I have no idea what that is.

110
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,900
But you were clearly really angry just now.

111
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,310
I'm always angry when I wake up.

112
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,650
I'm not Qiao Musheng. Really.

113
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,250
Mr. Qiao, can you stop playing with me?

114
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,950
I have to do an interview with you in order to take the training course, only after which I can get a promotion.

115
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,400
It's true.

116
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,996
If you don't believe me, I'll call my brother's office right now.

117
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,850
This is Qiao Musheng speaking.

118
00:11:08,558 --> 00:11:09,600
See?

119
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,950
I'm really not Qiao Musheng.

120
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,060
How about you do me a favor and help me move over to my clothes.

121
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,760
I'll see you around.

122
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,448
How about you help me get an interview with your brother?

123
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:32,130
Miss Su, how about you be responsible for me for the rest of my life?

124
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,810
Agreed?

125
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,750
Nothing happened between us last night!

126
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,850
Also, even though I touched you, I didn't mean to.

127
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:42,500
I'm getting married today, after all. It won't work between us.

128
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,300
In this case, I can't help you either.

129
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,300
Lu Jingnian!

130
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,615
I can't marry you anymore.

131
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:21,150
What about my training course?

132
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,920
Lu Jingnian!

133
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,850
Let's get married!

134
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,700
Thank you for saying yes!

135
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,350
- I didn't.
- Wait.

136
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,400
Please!

137
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,600
My fiancée stood me up.

138
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,430
Just go through the ceremony with me for show.

139
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,200
I accidentally took a photo of you.

140
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,800
My clothes seem to fit you quite well.

141
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,350
The color and style both really match your look.

142
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,200
What do you want?

143
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,850
Only after having this ceremony will my mom agree to let me take the training course.

144
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,080
I have to interview your brother to get the chance to take the training course.

145
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,545
I need them both.

146
00:13:26,545 --> 00:13:29,050
I'll delete the photo if you help me.

147
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,050
You really can't be saved.

148
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,400
The wedding ceremony is very simple.

149
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,448
We just have to go over the steps.

150
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,800
And each of us will get what we want.

151
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm going to go get ready.

152
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,550
I'll send the address to your phone.

153
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,090
You are forcing me to do this.

154
00:13:43,803 --> 00:13:44,990
Don't worry.

155
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:49,000
You'll get leading-actor-level performance with the price of a group actor.

156
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,550
You really are so much more reasonable than your brother.

157
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,520
Mr. Qiao, there really was only one room left last night.

158
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,148
All I could do was carry both of you in there.

159
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,100
I specifically put you in different places.

160
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,900
Who knew that she would climb into your bed later?

161
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,700
You pretended to be Lu Jingnian for your mother's health before.

162
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,850
Now there's one more woman you need to lie to.

163
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,650
Aren't you tired?

164
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,900
That's why we need to get rid of this once and for all.

165
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,350
I need you to do something for me.

166
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,708
Just tell me, Mr. Qiao.

167
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:43,948
[We Got Married!]

168
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,340
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

169
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,200
Come in, please. Come in.

170
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,100
You look so much better after getting your hair done.

171
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,200
Congratulations, Xiao Zhao.

172
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,600
- Congratulations!
- Please go inside.

173
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,130
Okay.

174
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,800
Has he never seen Zhao Yunduan before?

175
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,900
Zhao Yunduan and I have been friends since childhood. We were never together.

176
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,050
Besides, my sixth grand uncle has bad eyesight.

177
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,150
It's normal.

178
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,200
There'll be someone who can see clearly at the ceremony.

179
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,500
You are asking me to act without a script!

180
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,900
There is a script, there is!

181
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,850
I've thought about what my mom would ask you.

182
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,050
Mom! Ever since I met Lu Jingnian,

183
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:37,150
I realized that Zhao Yunduan wasn't my true love.

184
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,900
Xiao Lu, it's so hot today,

185
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,240
you must've driven here, right?

186
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,850
I only have ten vehicles. Please don't think it's too little.

187
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,750
The cost of a driver's license is a little expensive. I can't afford it.
(T/N: his responses sound similar to what she asked him to say)

188
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,800
Then where did you graduate from?

189
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,550
America's Carleton College, double Ph.D.

190
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,750
I stay at home every day. Never spent a penny on tuition fees.

191
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,770
Then what are you doing for a living now?

192
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,990
Investment-related job. No extra hours.

193
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:07,260
I'm not working right now. I stay at home, like a dead body.

194
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,170
Mom! Lu Jingnian is really funny.

195
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,490
That's what I like about him.

196
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,900
Honey! You're so cute!

197
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:23,250
Honey! Buddy, can you stop joking around?

198
00:16:24,496 --> 00:16:25,498
Okay?

199
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,950
Tell Mom what you are doing for a living.

200
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:32,000
Investment-related job. No extra hours.

201
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,000
Funny! You really are funny.

202
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,300
Stability is most important in a job.

203
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,300
As long as you are a decent guy who treats her well, then I'll be relieved.

204
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,910
Then I'll leave my daughter to you from now on.

205
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,810
Son-in-law!

206
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,000
Mom! This is true love for me this time.

207
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,450
Just give me your blessing!

208
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,900
Xiao Lu seems so much more stable than Yunduan.

209
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,800
As for the rest, I'll take care of it.

210
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,250
- Mom!
- Sister Ning!

211
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,300
What were you doing?

212
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,010
I was nervous. I accidentally told her the truth.

213
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,950
Mom! Mom!

214
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,980
Why so mysterious?

215
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,900
Mom, don't forget to give me back my savings after the wedding.

216
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,250
After all, I worked hard to earn that.

217
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,520
You only know how to worry about such trivial things.

218
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,970
Now that you've found the right guy, no need to worry about your future anymore.

219
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,450
Oh, right!

220
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,950
Let me show you my boyfriend.

221
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:30,400
He's five years younger than me and so good to me.

222
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,200
He even proposed to me.

223
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,750
Mom, you...

224
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:37,000
Okay. Enough of this. You should do your make-up now. Let's go.

225
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,930
I'll just take this as an immersive escape room.

226
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,700
I just need to solve the problems to get rid of her.

227
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,730
Xiao Nian?

228
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,600
My dear son!

229
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,850
You are getting married today?

230
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,406
Mom... I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to get overly excited.

231
00:18:06,406 --> 00:18:07,540
You can't take the stimulation.

232
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,170
It's a wonderful thing. I'll be fine after a little adjustment.

233
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,850
If she stays, my plan will be ruined.

234
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,940
Mom. Why don't you let me take you back to the hospital first?

235
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,250
Don't change the subject.

236
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:22,900
When did you get such a beautiful girlfriend named Su Nian?

237
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,460
- What? Who's calling my name?
- Honey!

238
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,553
You haven't done your make-up yet, stop running around.

239
00:18:27,553 --> 00:18:30,250
In-law!

240
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,400
- I'm so sorry.
- Shi Guang, cancel the plan!

241
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,600
It's all my son's fault.

242
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,100
We should've met earlier!

243
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,050
They also hid the wedding from you, right?

244
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,828
I just found out, too.

245
00:18:41,828 --> 00:18:43,900
Nian Nian! Be polite!

246
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,800
Auntie, nice to meet you.

247
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,140
- You should call me "Mom"!
- You should call her "Mom"!

248
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,940
Mom...

249
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:58,890
- Mom.
- They are so nice.

250
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:02,290
Look at the two of them. What a good couple!

251
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,350
Your girl looks just like you.

252
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,450
Her eyes are so beautiful.

253
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,250
Jingnian is such a good kid.

254
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,720
We won't need to kiss later, will we?

255
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:50,500
I spoke to the host. It's canceled.

256
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,350
Now the groom may kiss the bride!

257
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,060
Kiss! Hurry. Come on!

258
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,340
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

259
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:16,800
- Mom!
- Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

I like you!

I like you!

266
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:34,400
So, a love letter should come with flowers.

267
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,458
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

268
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,460
Qiao Musheng,

269
00:21:39,153 --> 00:21:42,853
do you have anything you want to say to me?

270
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,450
Wait for me here.

[To Su Nian]

272
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,800
You really can't be saved.

273
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,400
The wedding ceremony is very simple.

274
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,300
We just have to go over the steps.

275
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,900
And each of us will get what we want.

276
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,800
Lu Jingnian!

277
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,900
I really can't be saved from loving you.

278
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,850
You told me before that you thought a wedding was too much trouble, and you didn't want one.

279
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:48,000
Yet in a day you prepared such a beautiful wedding for me!

280
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,100
Lu Jingnian! We are finally married!

281
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,750
I object!

282
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,000
Him again?

283
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,700
Wrong use of prepositions.

284
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,250
Actually, Qiao Musheng's love letter isn't that bad.

285
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:20,260
- You are right.
- Just too many typos.

286
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,100
What are you doing?

287
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,000
Taking my girlfriend home. What else would I be doing?

288
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,020
I want to go home.

289
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:36,100
A relationship really isn't worth trying.

290
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,500
- In-law! I'm sorry, In-law.
- It's okay.

291
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,400
This is my daughter's ex-boyfriend. Please don't take this seriously.

292
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,500
Why would I?

293
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,200
The number of admirers shows how excellent Nian Nian is.

294
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,800
You really are so reasonable, In-law.

295
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,300
It's okay.

[Xiao Meng]

I'm sorry, I couldn't control myself.

298
00:24:01,969 --> 00:24:03,848
This was the reason you took my phone

299
00:24:03,848 --> 00:24:05,848
and sent Su Nian that photo?

300
00:24:05,848 --> 00:24:09,500
But you... you couldn't control yourself either, right?

301

- Bye bye!
- Bye bye.

302

[Shi Guang] Mr. Qiao, I'm sorry. I got too nervous.

303
00:24:23,092 --> 00:24:25,050
[Shi Guang] My phone was connected to the speaker through Bluetooth,

304
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:28,850
[Shi Guang] and I accidentally clicked the play button while I was trying to delete it.

305
00:24:31,648 --> 00:24:34,940
Lu Jingnian! You went through so much trouble with that recording just to expose me?

306
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,130
You threatened me first.

307
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,914
I was lying. I didn't take any photos.

308

♫ Turning the strange thoughts ♫

325
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,676
♫ Into real feelings. Holding your hands ♫

326
00:26:06,676 --> 00:26:09,620
♫ In the afternoon while the breeze blows ♫

327
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:13,370
♫ It's hard to say the words that you really want to say ♫

328
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:17,280
♫ When was it that you quietly walked ♫

329
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,520
♫ Into my heart ♫
