[Episode 3]

3
00:00:10,582 --> 00:00:12,082
Good morning!

4
00:00:12,922 --> 00:00:15,000
I cooked something nice for you.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,655
Yesterday... I was in a bad mood

6
00:00:24,655 --> 00:00:26,276
and got drunk.

7
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,788
Sorry about that.

8
00:00:28,788 --> 00:00:30,950
In the future, don't drink anymore.

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,600
All right, all right.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,650
I have a question for you.

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,900
Go ahead.

12
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:43,462
How has your mother been doing?

13
00:00:44,004 --> 00:00:46,364
Why did you ask about her suddenly?

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,098
My training course has fallen through.

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,239
You agreed to our agreement

16
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,419
because of your mother's health condition.

17
00:00:54,419 --> 00:00:58,800
So I was wondering how your mother...

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,492
Didn't you say you would never give up on your career?

19
00:01:04,267 --> 00:01:06,900
I don't have any other choice.

20
00:01:07,682 --> 00:01:11,595
Forget it. Nothing can't be overcome as long as you are willing to give up.

21
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,999
My mother is getting much better now.

22
00:01:15,999 --> 00:01:17,950
And my brother also had someone keeping an eye on her.

23
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,100
I'll find a way to explain it to her when the time comes.

24
00:01:22,022 --> 00:01:24,942
And I'll tell my mother the truth as soon as possible, too.

25
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:36,862
Look at you two.

26
00:01:36,862 --> 00:01:39,060
You were late for the interview!

27
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,100
And you... what did you bring back to me?

28
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,200
How would I know that Mr. Qiao only answered yes or no?

29
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,689
Editor-in-chief, please help me figure out a solution.

30
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,350
Come in.

31
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,630
Editor-in-chief, do you have time to talk?

32
00:01:58,402 --> 00:02:02,350
Here's the thing. We had a small misunderstanding with Mr. Qiao before,

33
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:06,900
and Mr. Qiao just agreed to do another in-depth interview.

34
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,800
Mr. Qiao has specifically made time for it

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,300
and he is willing to work with the official account to do an in-depth interview.

36
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,650
Then when do we leave?

37
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,350
Right now.

38
00:02:20,022 --> 00:02:21,722
Miss Su,

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,150
are you ready to leave right now?

40
00:02:27,727 --> 00:02:29,150
Me?

41
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,900
Are... you sure?

42
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,435
I'm sorry, Miss Xiao.

43
00:02:34,435 --> 00:02:36,148
The last interview you did was invalid.

44
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:39,540
You can claim compensation. Mr. Qiao will do his best to meet your request.

45
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:46,250
All right. Then Xiao Meng will help Su Nian proofread this time.

46
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,870
Mr. Qiao, I would like to know...

47
00:02:59,942 --> 00:03:01,842
Mr. Qiao...

48
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,700
Mr. Qiao...

49
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,450
Mr. Qiao, I'm sorry that I got drunk and lost my manners last night.

50
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,300
Are you sure you really want to accept my interview?

51
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,300
Let's make it quick.

52
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:26,555
I just told Lu Jingnian to end the agreement.

53
00:03:26,555 --> 00:03:29,200
It would be too improper for me to go back on my word.

54
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,300
I never said I would hold you accountable.

55
00:03:32,892 --> 00:03:35,705
Xiao Meng must've set me up again.

56
00:03:35,705 --> 00:03:37,842
Forget it, what matters now is to do this interview right.

57
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:41,400
Mr. Qiao, I heard that today is the first time the escape room will be evaluated.

58
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,450
May I have the honor to go in with you?

59
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,726
So that I can understand you better?

60
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,900
Just this once.

61
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,150
Miss Su, please go change then.

62
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,850
Okay. All right.

63
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,600
It's the first test for the escape room.

64
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,200
Usually, no outsiders should be present.

65
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,900
Fine. You own the escape room. It's up to you who enters.

66
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:23,792
Mr. Qiao, these... are matching outfits.

67
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,050
So?

68
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,900
Nothing. As long as you don't mind.

69
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,330
I'll lead the way. There's nothing to be scared of.

70
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,350
There's nothing here.

71
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,801
You know what? If you put an NPC behind the door

72
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:36,450
and make him jump out suddenly, it would definitely be really—

73
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,850
Kill me!

74
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,900
I don't want them to torture me again.

75
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,300
In return, I'll tell you all the secrets.

76
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,642
Take the knife, kill me.

77
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,350
I... I left the knife at the front desk.

78
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,450
Let me. Let me.

79
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,700
Hold onto me.

80
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,550
Is... Is that okay?

81
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,850
Onto my sleeve.

82
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,900
Look here.

83
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,250
There are so many bells.

84
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,701
I bet you have to ring them in a certain order until you get a hint.

85
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,950
Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.

86
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,850
You woke me up!

87
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,600
Why do we have to hide in here?

88
00:07:55,444 --> 00:07:58,494
Because... I'm afraid.

89
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,900
Then let me ask you a few questions.

90
00:08:10,748 --> 00:08:15,448
Qiao Musheng, what have you been through all these years?

91
00:08:15,448 --> 00:08:20,550
Why do you have a look that says "stay away from me"?

92
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,160
Is that a question on the interview outline?

93
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,950
It's something I personally wanted to ask you.

94
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,800
I've always been like this.

95
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,000
You can fool others, but you can't fool me.

96
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,900
We used to be classmates, after all.

97

No one can truly understand another person.

98
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,000
My hunch is very accurate.

99
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,900
Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.

100
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,000
Please don't be afraid.

101
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,950
I'm not.

102
00:09:20,812 --> 00:09:24,400
Mr. Qiao, thank you for taking me home today.

103
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,200
Seeing how scared you were today,

104
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,100
let's do the interview some other time then.

105

Mr. Qiao, have you been to my place before?

109
00:09:57,477 --> 00:09:59,800
You seem like you are quite familiar with my place.

110

Your apartment is small. You can see everything in one look.

111
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,950
True. It can't compare to your big house.

Thank you.

113

Mr. Qiao, your mother managed to get out of the hospital again.

Something to go with the crayfish? What do you think?

124

I know your mother favors Jingnian more.

166
00:14:11,045 --> 00:14:13,807
I took him with me back then because he was sick.

167
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:16,839
I wanted to make your mom's job easier.

168
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:18,977
After all these years,

169
00:14:18,977 --> 00:14:21,662
she still blames me for that.

170
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:24,303
And now she's seriously ill.

171
00:14:24,303 --> 00:14:27,192
How am I supposed to tell her?

172
00:14:27,192 --> 00:14:29,602
[In Operation]

173
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,998
Are you the patient's family?

174
00:14:37,998 --> 00:14:39,152
Yes, Doctor.

175
00:14:39,152 --> 00:14:41,480
With the patient's condition, she can't take any more trauma anymore.

176
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,314
Jingnian...

177
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,042
All right, all right, thank you.

178
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:46,379
You are finally back.

179
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:50,242
I thought... I would never see you again.

180
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:02,450
Mom, I'm back.

181
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,702
As long as you are back, that's good.

182
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:20,050
Mom, I'm sorry I lied to you.

183
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:24,400
Lu Jingnian and I lied to...

184
00:15:27,972 --> 00:15:29,306
Lied about what?

185
00:15:29,306 --> 00:15:32,050
Mom, actually, we just had a fight.

186
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,719
But we are good now.

187
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:36,550
Mom, Su Nian seems to be drunk.

188
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,270
I'll take her back to the bedroom to rest.

189
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,550
Go ahead.

190
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,985
- Lu Jingnian, you are not allowed in my room.
- Stop talking.

191
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,289
- I want to talk.
- Stop talking.

192
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:55,920
- I won't.
- You'll give us away if you keep talking.

193
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,131
I want to talk.

194
00:16:03,491 --> 00:16:07,362
You two... Get in the room first!

195
00:16:07,362 --> 00:16:09,800
Come on. Let's talk inside.

196
00:16:10,422 --> 00:16:14,224
Newlyweds are always so in love.

197
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,800
Get out.

198
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,242
I can't fly away...

199
00:16:27,308 --> 00:16:34,862
I can't fly away from this dazzling world.

200
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:42,082
Turns out I'm a drunk butterfly.

201
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,150
Be happy...

202
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:55,600
Whenever she is drunk, she says whatever is on her mind.

203
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,050
It seems that I can't reveal my true identity yet.

204
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,700
Mom, keep drinking with me.

205
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,308
I can drink more!

206
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:19,698
What do you think Qiao Musheng is doing right now?

207
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:26,000
We are having a good time here, yet he is always by himself.

208
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,100
It's all right. He is already used to it.

209
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,880
That's not true.

210
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,522
I bet he feels really sad.

211
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:41,200
Who doesn't want to be liked?

212
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,708
We are enjoying the crayfish without him.

213
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:50,800
I feel so guilty about that.

214
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,700
I... don't know how to act right now.

215
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,900
Su Nian, sober up!

216
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:21,442
Just now... you didn't...

217
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,000
I didn't do anything to you, did I?

218
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,751
No, no, you were very polite.

219
00:18:31,285 --> 00:18:33,285
Good to know.

220
00:18:37,097 --> 00:18:40,798
By the way, your mom always comes around unannounced,

221
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:42,801
and it looks like my training course is back on track.

222
00:18:42,801 --> 00:18:45,797
Should we continue our agreement?

223
00:18:45,797 --> 00:18:48,400
In that case, we can only continue.

224
00:18:49,198 --> 00:18:50,998
Okay.

225
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,450
Let's go to sleep.

226
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,700
Then you take the bed. I'll take the couch.

227
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,300
Or what?

228
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,700
We can watch a movie together. The really scary kind.

229
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,280
Don't get scared again.

230
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,650
Me scared? Are you kidding?

231
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:26,393
I tell you what, today when I was in your brother's escape room,

232
00:19:26,393 --> 00:19:30,380
I didn't even flinch, even though it was really terrifying. Aren't I amazing?

233
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,400
Don't be afraid. I'll be here with you.

234
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,650
You're not afraid?

235
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,500
Crap. I forgot to pretend.

236
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,700
I'm a man. I can't act scared in front of you, can I?

237
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,300
Here, for you.

238
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,950
It's okay.

239
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:08,200
Onto my sleeve.

240
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,750
You are the terrified one, aren't you?

241
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,102
So what? So what?

242
00:20:22,102 --> 00:20:24,002
So what?

243
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,503
For breakfast, we'll have...

244
00:21:21,182 --> 00:21:23,282
What are you doing?

245
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,400
Sorry, I forgot to knock on the door before coming in.

246
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,260
I'll let Shiguang take me back to the hospital. I'll come to visit you again.

247
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:39,451
I saw your hair was in your mouth, so I wanted to brush it away.

248
00:21:39,451 --> 00:21:42,151
I have an appointment. I've got to go now.

249
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:52,677
Mr. Lin.

250
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,600
I... can't drink.

251
00:22:01,048 --> 00:22:03,000
Mr. Lin, here's the thing.

252
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,737
Xiao Meng can hold her liquor much better than Su Nian.

253
00:22:05,737 --> 00:22:08,050
Xiao Meng, have a drink with Mr. Lin.

254
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,462
I need to use the bathroom.

255
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:15,800
Mr. Lin, you may not know, but Su Nian is a hard drinker.

256
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,200
Su Nian, you usually can drink a lot.

257
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,420
Just stop pretending.

258
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,852
Miss Su, you'll drink with others,

259
00:22:26,854 --> 00:22:29,300
but won't show me respect?

260
00:22:35,172 --> 00:22:36,050
Hello?

261
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:39,094
Mr. Zhang. Yes. Yes.

262
00:22:39,094 --> 00:22:40,544
That's right. That's right.

263
00:22:40,544 --> 00:22:42,444
Yes. Yes. Yes.

264
00:22:46,561 --> 00:22:51,900
Mr. Lin, then I'll drink this one glass to apologize to you.

265
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:56,400
Miss Su, didn't you just say you couldn't drink spirits?

266
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,900
I won't force you either.

267
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,150
Come, to make it easier for you, I'll pour you some red wine.

268
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,350
Mr. Lin, then I'll drink this one glass to apologize to you.

269
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:20,400
- I still need to go home after I drink─
- How about this, Miss Su?

270
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,792
You can go after drinking three glasses.

271
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,700
Mr. Lin, then I'm leaving now.

272
00:24:11,312 --> 00:24:13,412
Why do I get weak in my knees?

273
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,000
Miss.

274
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:40,251
Pretty girls just like being punished nowadays.

275
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:41,700
I've already called the police.

276
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,700
If you dare...

277
00:24:46,535 --> 00:24:48,535
Don't!

278
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,200
Come on!

279
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,550
Lu Jingnian?

280
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,950
It is me. You are safe now.

281
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,162
Su Nian. Su Nian?

282
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,900
Where's Su Nian?

283
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,750
She has been taken away.

284
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,562
That bastard has been taken away too.

285
00:25:51,562 --> 00:25:54,046
Who took Su Nian away?

286
00:25:54,046 --> 00:25:57,050
Qiao Musheng. He happened to pass by and saved her.

287
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,700
You went to the dinner together.

288
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,800
How come something almost happened only to her?

289
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,800
Xiao Meng, don't think that I don't know what you are up to!

290
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,040
So you only care about her safety, is that right?

291
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:09,579
I was also scared just now.

292
00:26:09,579 --> 00:26:11,850
What kind of person do you take me for anyway?

293
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:14,600
Do you think I would throw off morals for personal interests?

294
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,800
I didn't expect him to be that much of a bastard!

295
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,000
Believe it or not, I called the police just now.

296
00:26:40,042 --> 00:26:42,750
Where's my phone? I need to give my mother a call.

297
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,900
Nian Nian, I told her that you called her accidentally.

298
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,330
I've also informed Zhao Yunduan.

299
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:51,950
How did you know I was in trouble?

300
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,800
I added myself to your emergency contacts.

301
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:17,262
Lu Jingnian... I was so scared just now.

302
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:20,882
I was... I was worried that my mother would miss my message.

303
00:27:20,882 --> 00:27:24,300
I was also worried that Zhao Yunduan would misplace his phone.

304
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:30,162
I was really worried that no one would see my messages.

305
00:27:30,162 --> 00:27:32,650
You have me. Don't be afraid.

306
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,800
I'll always have my phone nearby,

307
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,931
even when I take a shower.

308
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,822
I'll be always with you.

309
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,958
Then what if you fall asleep

310
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:48,662
and can't see my message?

311
00:27:48,662 --> 00:27:50,870
I won't go to sleep until you are home.

312
00:27:55,742 --> 00:27:57,598
Jerk.

313
00:27:57,598 --> 00:27:59,431
Don't say such words.

314
00:27:59,431 --> 00:28:01,745
I'll take them seriously.

315
00:28:01,745 --> 00:28:03,600
You can.

316
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,050
Lu Jingnian?

317
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,250
It is me.

318
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:17,362
Jingnian, I thought... I would never see you again.

319
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:21,350
Mom, I'm back.

320
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,920
It's my duty... as your roommate.

321
00:29:05,542 --> 00:29:07,442
38.5 degrees.

322
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:11,320
Su Nian, go back to your room and lie down, okay?

323
00:29:14,657 --> 00:29:16,700
Wherever you go, I'm going too.

324
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,150
You are safe now.

325
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,400
No one will hurt you here.

326
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:25,800
Let me walk you to your room, okay?

327
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:38,050
Where are your slippers?

328
00:29:46,922 --> 00:29:49,252
Lu Jingnian, you know what?

329
00:29:49,252 --> 00:29:51,846
Actually, I had already thought through everything.

330
00:29:51,846 --> 00:29:54,150
How to call the police,

331
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:56,612
how to keep evidence,

332
00:29:56,612 --> 00:29:59,150
and how to lie to my mother.

333
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:03,408
I didn't expect anybody would show up.

334
00:30:03,408 --> 00:30:06,282
But who knew you would come to my rescue.

335
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,950
I'm a fast runner.

336
00:30:14,185 --> 00:30:16,750
Thank you, Lu Jingnian.

337
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:21,100
For letting me feel that I have someone to rely on.

338
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:25,220
We are friends. Right?

339
00:31:01,122 --> 00:31:05,242
♫ I want to escape this world ♫

340
00:31:05,242 --> 00:31:09,002
♫ Touching the edges of a mistake ♫

341
00:31:09,002 --> 00:31:12,640
♫ Will you understand? ♫

342
00:31:12,642 --> 00:31:15,880
♫ All the happenings in my heart ♫

343
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,046
♫ The broken promises ♫

344
00:31:20,046 --> 00:31:23,361
♫ But you are my light ♫

345
00:31:23,361 --> 00:31:27,952
♫ Just need your care and love ♫

346
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:32,966
♫ To fill in all my vacancies ♫

347
00:31:54,962 --> 00:31:57,904
♫ It's a miracle that we met ♫

348
00:31:57,904 --> 00:32:01,680
♫ Like two parallel lines intertwined ♫

349
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,581
♫ You walked into my life ♫

350
00:32:03,581 --> 00:32:07,044
♫ Going round and round every day ♫

351
00:32:07,044 --> 00:32:10,084
♫ Try to calm my heart, near or far ♫

352
00:32:10,084 --> 00:32:13,871
♫ There's an unspoken secret ♫

353
00:32:13,871 --> 00:32:15,824
♫ Still constantly missing you a little ♫

354
00:32:15,824 --> 00:32:19,201
♫ But I can't let you so easily find that out ♫

355
00:32:19,201 --> 00:32:22,244
♫ Turns out you've been with me ♫

356
00:32:22,244 --> 00:32:25,287
♫ The lies gradually become tenderness ♫

357
00:32:25,287 --> 00:32:27,584
♫ Turning the strange thoughts ♫

358
00:32:27,584 --> 00:32:31,285
♫ Into real feelings. Holding your hands ♫

359
00:32:31,285 --> 00:32:34,464
♫ In the afternoon while the breeze blows ♫

360
00:32:34,464 --> 00:32:38,384
♫ It's hard to say the words that you really want to say ♫

361
00:32:38,384 --> 00:32:42,004
♫ When was it that you quietly walked ♫

362
00:32:42,004 --> 00:32:45,965
♫ Into my heart ♫
