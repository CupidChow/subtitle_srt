[Better a Lie Than a Truth]

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,600
[Episode 2]

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,400
Look how well we worked together today.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,790
Would you consider living together?

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,700
How about my apartment?

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,750
Your smile is a little stiff.

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,780
Relax your brow ridge a little, and you'll seem more genuine.

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,700
I don't want to trouble you either,

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,900
but my mom is still a little suspicious.

10
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,150
She said that she is going to do something like pay me back in batches.

11
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,620
It will take three months to get my tuition back.

12
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,600
That's none of my business.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,210
Son, I'll come by to see you tomorrow. Someone needs to be home, okay?

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,570
Mom, we are both busy tomorrow.

15
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,723
I don't care. Figure something out yourselves.

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,470
We can consider living together.

17
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,380
I'll go back and pack now.

18
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,100
[Su Nian's Apartment]

19
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,700
This apartment is too small, isn't it?

20
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,900
Should I ask the tenant in my apartment on Zhongwu Road to leave?

21
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,270
Don't do that.

22
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,200
The two of them just got married,

23
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,600
they like small rooms and tiny beds.

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,680
- It will bring them closer.
- Right, right, closer.

25
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,490
By the way, Nian Nian. When are you going to get registered?
(T/N: Registering with the government makes the marriage official)

26
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,250
I heard that you can get on the waiting list online through an app.

27
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,800
You should hurry and make an appointment.

28
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,700
Er... It's like this mom.

29
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,730
Su Nian did a little research, and an auspicious day is three months away.

30
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,200
Right.

31
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,760
We are one family from now on. Tell me if you need anything.

32
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,970
Don't be polite.

33
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,130
Mom, I really do need to ask you for something.

34
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,000
I've been trying to get an interview with Qiao Musheng recently.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,540
- Can you make an appointment for me?
- Okay.

36
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,850
My brother is really busy. He doesn't have time.

37
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,800
Busy, busy, busy. All he knows how to do is work.

38
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,600
He doesn't have time for his family at all. He's also Nian Nian's brother.

39
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,730
It's nothing. Leave it to me.

40
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,700
Thank you, Mom!

41
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,350
Mom, it's getting late.

42
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,500
You two should go on back and rest.

43
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,420
They are going to rest, too. Let's go, let's go.

44
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,400
Mom, take care.

45
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,150
You two, don't stay up too late.

46
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,050
My female warriors, keep an eye on him for me,

47
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,870
and don't let him pass the boundary line.

48
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,770
You don't need to worry about that.

49
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,100
"Roommate Rules and Regulations"?

50
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,500
After 9pm at night, do not cross the boundary line.
[2. Do not plunder other people's food without consent]

51
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,650
No wait, you really are ridiculous.

52
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,450
What could a girl like me do to you?

53
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,750
Lessons learned from the past.

54
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,630
- That day, at the hotel...
- That day...

55
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,210
That day I was drunk.

56
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,950
Besides, this is my apartment.

57
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,100
What can you do even if I don't obey your rules?

58
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,700
Try it.

59
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,100
What did you buy?

60
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,950
Curiosity killed the cat.

61
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:05,130
Your fish is over the line, make it go back.

62
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,050
Don't you like animals?

63
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,790
Your brother likes animals quite a bit.

64
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,798
Especially Goldfish.

65
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,900
You seem to know my brother quite well.

66
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,598
Of course I do. We were classmates after all.

67
00:04:22,598 --> 00:04:24,550
Also, he's my interviewee.

68
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,550
Of course I know him very well.

69
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,550
Then I'll take good care of it.

70
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,900
You really are fickle.

71
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,650
I got the things you mailed.

72
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,800
So, you really are going to accept the interview today?

73
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,000
She used my mom,

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,360
and she knows Qiao Musheng quite a bit.

75
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,650
Then be careful.

76
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,320
You're awake!

77
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,150
I made you breakfast. Shall we eat together?

78
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,528
You didn't put poison in it, did you?

79
00:06:03,528 --> 00:06:05,900
I acted like that last night because you overreacted first.

80
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,500
I was just going to get some water.

81
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,498
It was my fault yesterday.

82
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,050
Does your hand still hurt?

83
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,488
I... I...

84
00:06:16,488 --> 00:06:18,550
Shouldn't I ask about you first?

85
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,300
Did I damage your head?

86
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,370
I'm not hurting. Not at all.

87
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,698
I just think that since we are roomies now,

88
00:06:28,698 --> 00:06:32,700
then shouldn't we get along in the next three months?

89
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,850
Hello, new Roomie.

90
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,100
No, that's okay.

91
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,400
We are just working together.

92
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,440
I think it's good as it is.

93
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,560
What's wrong?

94
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,960
Nothing.

95
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,400
You're a good cook.

96
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,650
Eating like that isn't good for your health.

97
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,650
Why don't you eat what I made?

98
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,000
You drew the line and then went ahead to cross it yourself.

99
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,720
Oh, right, I'm finally going to interview your brother today.

100
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,000
As your roomie, do you have any information to offer?

101
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,200
No, I don't.

102
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,150
You know what his personality is like.

103
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,300
Also, we haven't been in touch for a long time.

104
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,050
Okay.

105
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,150
Do you need to cover the injury on your head?

106
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,500
It's just a minor injury. Nothing serious.

107
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,500
The liquid foundation is in the bathroom. Go do it yourself.

108
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,940
Stop!

109
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,540
What's wrong?

110
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:12,700
I'm the one who hit you after all. Let me help you.

111
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,100
I'm... going to work.

112
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,435
My daughter, are you off to work?

113
00:09:00,435 --> 00:09:02,160
Why are you here?

114
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,400
I came to ask you something today.

115
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,292
I heard that you object to me marrying your mom?

116
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:10,002
I said I object, so I object.

117
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,950
Is there some misunderstanding between us? Dad will explain everything.

118
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,800
You pretend to be a small business owner in front of my mom.

119
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,000
But how much gambling debt are you actually hiding?

120
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,900
Who told you that bullshit? That's nonsense!

121
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,400
Today, I'm going to do what I can as your father!

122
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,200
What are you doing?

123
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,050
What's your problem?

124
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,200
You are not going anywhere today. I'm going to teach you a lesson.

125
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Okay! Let's see what you've got. Run over me!

126
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,700
Mr. Qiao, how does it feel to be beaten?

127
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,600
Would you like to give it a try?

128
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,700
No, I'm good.

129
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,150
I think I'll just tell Auntie the truth.

130
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,050
This is an interview, not a questionnaire.

131
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,150
How come none of your answers is more than two words.

132
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,835
That should be enough.

133
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,700
Editor Su is two hours late already.

134
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,530
Maybe she had a feeling that this wouldn't pay off.

135
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,180
- Mr. Qiao, the Elite Official Account has sent someone here.
- Sure.

136
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,580
Okay.

137
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,380
You? What are you doing here?

138
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,078
What am I doing here?

139
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,050
You should thank me.

140
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,670
You are two hours late.

141
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,650
Mr. Qiao's assistant called the Editor-in-chief and asked about it.

142
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:52,250
I was in the neighborhood, so I thought I could do you a favor.

143
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,710
You!

144
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,080
If you ask me,

145
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,780
don't fight against me for the training course anymore.

146
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,520
You'll likely never need them.

147
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,930
If you're that afraid, why watch it?

148
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,150
I... I didn't know you were home. Sorry.

149
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,800
Open the door!

150
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,950
Son-in-law?

151
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,300
Is my daughter home?

152
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,850
I want to speak to her.

153
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,800
Su Nian! Get out here!

154
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,980
What the hell do you want?

155
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,770
Why won't you agree to it?

156
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,100
Your mom and I are about to get married. Why are you causing trouble?

157
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,500
If you do that again! I'll smash your home to pieces!

158
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,800
I'm going to teach you a lesson today!

159
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,500
A girl doesn't have to be so tough.

160
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,600
If you're not tough, then you'll easily be bullied.

161
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,050
I'm telling you,

162
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,400
your brother wouldn't say anything when he was bullied back then.

163
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,300

Forget it, it's fine. It's fine.

Don't you know how late you were for the interview with Qiao Musheng?

Fortunately, Xiao Meng was there to take care of it.

and cancel your qualification for the training course.

206

I can accept deducting my bonus for a month,

207
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,240
but why cancel my qualification for training course?

Why?

209
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,750
You were so late for the interview,

and Mr. Qiao was incredibly displeased.

Editor-in-chief, it was my fault that I was late yesterday.

He cares about me every day.

And he's not angry with you anymore.

236

I bought him a new pair of shoes to make him feel better.

No! You weren't like this.

When we were in school, there was a goldfish in our classroom.

You were the only one who had been taking care of it until the end.

why people liked the goldfish and then why they didn't.

288

You wanted to know what that felt like

00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:55,198
When that time comes, no one will remove my make-up for me.

327
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:59,850
Then what do I need to do for you to stop crying?

328
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,300
I don't know!

329
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:10,050
I'm hopeless.

330
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,940
♫ It's a miracle that we met ♫

331
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:47,798
♫ Like two parallel lines intertwined ♫

332
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,710
♫ You walked into my life ♫

333
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:53,080
♫ Going round and round every day ♫

334
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,020
♫ Try to calm my heart, near or far ♫

335
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,900
♫ There's an unspoken secret ♫

336
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,540
♫ Still constantly missing you a little ♫

337
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:05,230
♫ But I can't let you so easily find that out ♫

338
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:08,180
♫ Turns out you've been with me ♫

339
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:11,320
♫ The lies gradually become tenderness ♫

340
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,520
♫ Turning the strange thoughts ♫

341
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,815
♫ Into real feelings ♫

342
00:27:15,815 --> 00:27:17,320
♫ Holding your hands ♫

343
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,400
♫ In the afternoon while the breeze blows ♫

344
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,020
♫ It's hard to say the words that you really want to say ♫

345
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:28,040
♫ When was it that you quietly walked ♫

346
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,580
♫ Into my heart ♫
