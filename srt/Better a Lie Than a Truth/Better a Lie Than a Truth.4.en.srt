[Episode 4]

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,950
Mr. Lin was almost attacked last night.

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,700
The police asked me to take a statement this morning.

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,804
You don't need to worry.

6
00:00:14,804 --> 00:00:17,150
So fake.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,582
But now there's no way to interview Mr. Lin,

8
00:00:22,582 --> 00:00:24,698
and it's hard to get Qiao Musheng.

9
00:00:24,698 --> 00:00:29,400
I guess it'll take at least a month to run lines and take photos.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,953
I'm afraid we'll have to leave the column blank in the next issue.

11
00:00:32,953 --> 00:00:34,654
How could we do that?

12
00:00:34,654 --> 00:00:38,222
Why don't we give Mr. Lin an interview in prison?

13
00:00:38,224 --> 00:00:40,024
What do you think?

14
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:44,866
If I ask Zhao Yunduan to do a photoshoot for Qiao Musheng,

15
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:47,446
it should be in time for the next issue, right?

16
00:00:47,446 --> 00:00:48,559
I just knew it!

17
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,659
You are the pillar of our official account!

18
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,200
Just give it to me.

19
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:17,810
Why does he keep looking around? I don't know what he's looking at.

20
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,320
How am I supposed to make bricks without straw?

21
00:01:34,442 --> 00:01:36,905
Lu Jingnian.

22
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,969
Why do I always think about Lu Jingnian?

23
00:01:57,965 --> 00:01:59,392
None of them came out right.

24
00:01:59,392 --> 00:02:01,702
It's a wrap. Let's pack up.

25
00:02:01,702 --> 00:02:03,169
All right.

26
00:02:06,506 --> 00:02:09,558
Nian Nian, I know I made a mistake.

27
00:02:09,558 --> 00:02:12,402
But you can't just move in with another man.

28
00:02:12,402 --> 00:02:17,222
I told you on the phone that it's only temporary.

29
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:18,943
You've got the nerve to say this to me?

30
00:02:18,945 --> 00:02:22,160
You were the one who suggested that we hold a ceremony for the sake of formality.

31
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,016
But on the wedding day? You fooled around with Xiao Meng, and...

32
00:02:26,882 --> 00:02:28,658
That's because she set me up,

33
00:02:28,658 --> 00:02:30,222
and I already made it clear to her that day.

34
00:02:30,222 --> 00:02:32,022
Please forgive me.

35
00:02:32,022 --> 00:02:36,429
You were always an unreliable person. I've already gotten used to it.

36
00:02:36,429 --> 00:02:38,620
It won't happen again.

37
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,780
Please have Qiao Musheng's brother move out, okay?

38
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,680
Stay out of my business.

39
00:02:43,682 --> 00:02:45,782
Just mind your own business.

40
00:02:45,782 --> 00:02:49,138
Then don't ignore me anymore. Let's make up with each other.

41
00:02:49,742 --> 00:02:51,642
Fine, fine, fine.

42
00:02:52,345 --> 00:02:55,862
Then would you like to have dinner with me after work?

43
00:02:55,862 --> 00:02:57,132
I drove with my car today.

44
00:02:57,132 --> 00:02:59,163
Su Nian, what are you doing?

45
00:02:59,163 --> 00:03:02,648
If you don't want to, we can go shopping together.

46
00:03:02,648 --> 00:03:05,228
There's a new store. The clothes are really nice there.

47
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:06,869
Really, they are perfect for you.

48
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:08,779
Would you like to go check it out?

49
00:03:08,779 --> 00:03:10,411
All right. All right.

50
00:03:10,411 --> 00:03:12,460
Then it's a date.

51
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,172
Do you think you aren't nosy enough?

52
00:03:16,141 --> 00:03:18,021
Please don't be mad anymore.

53
00:03:18,021 --> 00:03:19,998
It's my treat, okay?

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,300
Okay?

55
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,260
Shiguang, someone is looking for Zhao Yunduan outside.

56
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,240
- Who?
- Someone.

57
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,111
The decoration is totally your style.

58
00:03:30,331 --> 00:03:31,931
All right?

59
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:35,040
Mr. Zhao, your car has been towed.

60
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,880
I'll go take a look.

61
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:43,468
Hello?

62
00:03:43,468 --> 00:03:46,611
Nian Nian, something happened, and I need your help.

63
00:03:46,613 --> 00:03:49,169
You can come alone.

64
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:51,000
All right.

65
00:04:24,381 --> 00:04:26,938
Lu Jingnian, if I don't contact you in half an hour,

66
00:04:26,938 --> 00:04:29,026
come to this address to find me.

67
00:04:34,914 --> 00:04:37,345
I'll beat you to death if you don't give me the money! Will you give it or not?

68
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:40,049
Get out of here!

69
00:04:40,049 --> 00:04:42,248
- Good, you're back. Hurry and tell your mother to give me money.
- Are you okay?

70
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:44,638
I promise I'll let you two live a wealthy life from now on!

71
00:04:44,638 --> 00:04:47,843
What's the matter with you? Do you think I'm stupid?

72
00:04:52,131 --> 00:04:53,443
I consider you my daughter.

73
00:04:53,443 --> 00:04:55,098
Don't always push my buttons. Call me father!

74
00:04:55,098 --> 00:04:57,467
You'll be sorry if you do this to my mother again!

75
00:04:57,467 --> 00:04:59,867
You also deserve to be beaten!

76
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,020
Nian Nian!

77
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,170
I'll beat you to death!

78
00:05:16,931 --> 00:05:19,031
How did you know?

79
00:05:20,204 --> 00:05:22,204
Lu Jingnian told me.

80
00:05:23,631 --> 00:05:25,631
Thankfully he's there.

81
00:05:29,522 --> 00:05:31,902
I really appreciate it, Qiao Musheng.

82
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:34,089
No problem.

83
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,774
You'll be fine. Every family has its problems.

84
00:05:50,989 --> 00:05:53,686
But my family's problems are really hard to deal with.

85
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,681
Don't worry. He has already been arrested by the police.

86
00:05:56,681 --> 00:05:59,231
He won't bother you anymore.

87
00:05:59,231 --> 00:06:00,982
Thank you.

88
00:06:01,631 --> 00:06:03,581
I saw this line online,

89
00:06:03,581 --> 00:06:08,922
"When you feel desperate, think about your family, and you'll still have hope."

90
00:06:08,922 --> 00:06:13,153
But it's not the same for me. When I think about my family,

91
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,420
there isn't any hope left.

92
00:06:16,425 --> 00:06:17,938
How come?

93
00:06:17,938 --> 00:06:20,243
You are your own hope.

94
00:06:21,627 --> 00:06:23,127
That's right.

95
00:06:23,127 --> 00:06:27,396
But today I pinned my hopes on someone else.

96
00:06:27,396 --> 00:06:30,481
The results weren't bad.

97
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:35,522
I think I've started to rely on Lu Jingnian more and more.

98
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,180
What's this?

99
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,469
A lie detector.

100
00:06:45,481 --> 00:06:50,154
My mother gave it to me so that I can test Lu Jingnian.

101
00:06:50,154 --> 00:06:53,581
If he has lied to you, will you forgive him?

102
00:06:57,198 --> 00:06:59,642
You thought it was real? I was joking.

103
00:06:59,642 --> 00:07:02,742
Besides, why would he lie to me?

104
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:26,631
Lu Jingnian, thank you for helping me today.

105
00:07:26,631 --> 00:07:28,591
It's so nice to have you around.

106
00:07:36,931 --> 00:07:38,929
She likes you, too.

107
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:40,832
What should I do?

108
00:07:58,695 --> 00:07:59,882
Let's play this one.

109
00:07:59,882 --> 00:08:01,131
Why did you suddenly want to play with this?

110
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:02,936
My mom gave it to me.

111
00:08:02,936 --> 00:08:04,481
I checked it online.

112
00:08:04,481 --> 00:08:06,431
You can buy it for 50 Yuan ($8).

113
00:08:06,431 --> 00:08:07,931
It is definitely not accurate.

114
00:08:07,931 --> 00:08:10,430
Just consider it killing time with me.

115
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,742
What's meant to happen, will happen.

116
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:16,931
Here we go then.

117
00:08:21,414 --> 00:08:24,682
What do you think of me?

118
00:08:25,997 --> 00:08:27,797
Very nice.

119
00:08:27,797 --> 00:08:29,742
True.

120
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,760
Then...

121
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,531
is there someone you love?

122
00:08:48,435 --> 00:08:49,935
Yes.

123
00:08:51,842 --> 00:08:53,542
True.

124
00:08:55,081 --> 00:08:56,981
Who?

125
00:09:03,082 --> 00:09:04,982
My mother.

126
00:09:04,982 --> 00:09:06,902
That's boring.

127
00:09:08,107 --> 00:09:09,362
One more question.

128
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:13,322
That's too much. I haven't asked you any yet.

129
00:09:13,322 --> 00:09:16,262
Would you like to visit the Canton Tower with me?

130
00:09:17,331 --> 00:09:20,181
To show my gratitude, it'll be my treat.

131
00:09:20,181 --> 00:09:21,803
All right.

132
00:09:30,431 --> 00:09:33,981
Mr. Qiao, are we really going to buy flowers in person?

133
00:09:33,981 --> 00:09:35,318
What else?

134
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,340
They can deliver them right to your door nowadays.

135
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,760
I would like to see the real thing first.

136
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,200
Mr. Qiao, I think you got into your character too much lately.

137
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,460
If that's true, will Qiao Musheng disappear?

138
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,941
That's not bad actually.

139
00:09:52,941 --> 00:09:58,231
Mr. Qiao. I think you've got into the character because you've played the role for too long.

140
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:00,520
It'll be better after it's over.

141
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,304
Over?

142
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:07,181
As soon as Mrs. Qiao's condition is more stable.

143
00:10:07,181 --> 00:10:09,131
But so far it's still unstable,

144
00:10:09,131 --> 00:10:11,457
and on top of that, we've got Miss Su.

145
00:10:12,531 --> 00:10:13,981
That's right.

146
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:16,072
Looks like it'll never end.

147
00:10:16,922 --> 00:10:21,022
And... I don't want it to end either.

148
00:11:18,381 --> 00:11:19,781
Hello?

149
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,781
Okay, I see.

150
00:11:23,781 --> 00:11:26,481
Mr. Qiao, the escape room is on fire!

151
00:11:31,702 --> 00:11:33,202
Let's go back.

152
00:11:36,802 --> 00:11:41,231
Sorry. There's an emergency. I may be a little late.

153
00:11:56,288 --> 00:11:59,782
You dare to be this late on our first date?

154
00:11:59,782 --> 00:12:01,922
I'll punish you severely later!

155
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,227
Hello? Editor-in-chief.

156
00:12:17,227 --> 00:12:19,867
Su Nian, I heard Mr. Qiao's escape room was on fire.

157
00:12:19,867 --> 00:12:22,681
He was injured saving someone's life. Remember to visit him tomorrow.

158
00:12:22,681 --> 00:12:25,025
What happened?

159
00:12:25,025 --> 00:12:26,132
How would I know?

160
00:12:26,132 --> 00:12:29,052
Just make sure to visit him tomorrow. He's at Hongda Hospital.

161

[Emergency Dept]

163
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,881
After the examination, you don't have any external injuries on your body.

164
00:12:54,881 --> 00:12:57,931
But the thick smoke you inhaled contained all kinds of harmful gases.

165
00:12:57,931 --> 00:13:00,249
You need to take oxygen and rest.

00:13:00,249 --> 00:13:02,379
We'll put you under observation for 24 hours first. Okay?

167
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,832
All right, all right. Thank you, Doctor.

168
00:13:12,331 --> 00:13:13,981
Are the others safe?

169
00:13:13,981 --> 00:13:17,681
Don't worry. The fire has been put out. The firemen got them all out.

170
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,581

173
00:13:31,822 --> 00:13:35,322
Just tell her that Lu Jingnian went to visit his mother.

174
00:13:35,331 --> 00:13:37,411
This is very important to her.

175

Hi, could you please tell me which room Qiao Musheng is in?

176
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,331
- Sure. One moment, please.
- Okay. Thanks.

177

178
00:14:14,831 --> 00:14:17,082
- He's in room 612. Right over there.
- Okay.

179

Thank you.

180

- Shiguang?
- Su Nian!

- I didn't mean that. I was saying...

186

Okay.

194
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:33,431
Calm down. You are worried about him just because...

195
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:35,731
because he's Lu Jingnian's brother.

196
00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:38,231
That's all. There's nothing more.

197

Don't let your thoughts wander so much.

198
00:15:40,202 --> 00:15:41,923
Stop thinking too much.

199
00:15:43,424 --> 00:15:47,424
Oh, no. Lu Jingnian may still be waiting for me.

200
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,381
I'm sorry.

201
00:15:56,381 --> 00:15:59,781
I stood you up on our first date.

202
00:16:00,531 --> 00:16:02,040
I should apologize to you.

203
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:04,970
I just finished my work and I heard that my brother had an accident.

204
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,681
I'm on my way to visit him now.

205

What's wrong?

206
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,331
Nothing. Is... Is your brother okay?

207
00:16:27,731 --> 00:16:31,631
I asked. It's not serious.

208
00:16:33,731 --> 00:16:36,981
Am I kind of a jerk?

209
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:40,429
May I ask you out again?

210
00:16:40,429 --> 00:16:42,389
I would like to make it up to you by taking you to the Canton Tower.

211
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,090
I...

212
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:47,000
I...

213
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,872
It's not good enough?

214
00:16:48,872 --> 00:16:51,141
Then, I'll take you to a more expensive place.

215
00:16:51,141 --> 00:16:54,590
No, no, no, the Canton Tower is fine.

216
00:16:59,731 --> 00:17:03,331
Su Nian, what are you doing?

217
00:17:21,031 --> 00:17:24,181
Are you going to skip breakfast again?

218
00:17:24,181 --> 00:17:27,912
I'm a little busy these days. I've got to go.

219
00:17:27,912 --> 00:17:31,631
What is it? Did I do something that made you angry?

220
00:17:31,631 --> 00:17:34,334
No. I've just got a load of work to do.

221
00:17:34,334 --> 00:17:36,835
I need to hurry. I'm off.

222
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:55,281
Something's wrong with Su Nian.

223
00:17:55,281 --> 00:17:58,503
Ever since that day, she has been avoiding me.

224
00:17:58,503 --> 00:18:01,731
Maybe it's time for you to tell her the truth.

225
00:18:01,731 --> 00:18:03,829
But I don't want to hurt her.

226
00:18:03,831 --> 00:18:06,781
The longer you wait, the more you'll hurt her.

227
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:08,781
And it's not like Qiao Musheng doesn't have a chance anyway.

228
00:18:08,781 --> 00:18:11,531
I can see that she cares a lot about Qiao Musheng.

229
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:25,522
Is that even possible?

230
00:18:36,502 --> 00:18:38,102
Su Nian.

231
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:41,454
You've been distracted a lot recently.

I'm not, Editor-in-chief.

234
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,235
It is.

Aren't you happy that your name will appear on the byline?

236
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,329
I know you did a good job.

237
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:55,555
Do I need to let you be the Editor-in-chief to make you happy?

238
00:18:55,555 --> 00:18:58,139
N-No, I didn't mean that.

239

You young people shouldn't take it so seriously when

240

those interviewees with high social statuses are nice to you.

241
00:19:05,462 --> 00:19:09,481
You won't see them again after the interview.

242

It's really not like that.

Second, her body won't lie.

Qiao Musheng. May I ask what brings you here today?

Don't say "May I."

No need to mind the formalities when you talk to me.

So, what brings you here today? I still have work to do.

Next week is Jingnian's birthday.

You should know it better than I do.

263
00:20:44,831 --> 00:20:48,931
Then... all right.

264

I can't be like this anymore.

The one I like should be Lu Jingnian.

But why I am I thinking about Qiao Musheng all the time?

267

Qiao Musheng. Lu Jingnian.

He's fine now.

That's good to know.

273
00:21:36,117 --> 00:21:39,603
It suddenly occurred to me that I should ask how he's doing.

274

What's the matter?

You are more experienced in terms of this. I have a question for you.

278
00:22:33,131 --> 00:22:35,942
You seldom ask me questions. Go ahead.

279
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:39,682
Do you think...

280
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,702
it's possible to love two people at the same time?

281
00:22:44,702 --> 00:22:47,542
No way. Speaking from my own experience,

282
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:50,920
if you liked A first, and then fall for B,

283
00:22:50,922 --> 00:22:52,931
then your true love must be B.

284
00:22:52,931 --> 00:22:56,832
Because if you truly loved A, there wouldn't be a B.

285
00:22:58,922 --> 00:23:01,982
So you've had this problem before?

How do you know who you liked first?

00:23:12,817 --> 00:23:16,562
It depends on who I met first, then that's it.

290
00:23:17,506 --> 00:23:18,598
That's right.

00:26:21,102 --> 00:26:23,497
but you are not really married.

328
00:26:23,497 --> 00:26:25,515
How did you know?

329
00:26:28,637 --> 00:26:30,362
Lu Jingnian told you?

330
00:26:30,362 --> 00:26:32,559
Yes. Not long ago.

331
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,644
Don't worry, though.

332
00:26:35,646 --> 00:26:38,296
I won't tell anybody.

333
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:39,722
Thank you.

334
00:26:58,532 --> 00:27:00,032
So...

335
00:27:01,722 --> 00:27:04,982
are you in love with Lu Jingnian now?

336
00:27:10,131 --> 00:27:11,931
You aren't?

337
00:27:14,181 --> 00:27:17,131
Why are you suddenly asking me this question?

338
00:27:17,131 --> 00:27:19,381
I also care about him occasionally.

339
00:27:23,145 --> 00:27:25,742
Yes. I like him.

Thank you.

00:28:08,281 --> 00:28:09,381
Mom.

346
00:28:09,381 --> 00:28:10,581
You've come.

347
00:28:10,581 --> 00:28:12,742
Do you want some fruit?

348
00:28:12,742 --> 00:28:15,481
No. I'm good. Thanks, Mom.

349
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,929
Mom, you should get some rest.

350
00:28:21,931 --> 00:28:23,515
It's not winter yet.

351
00:28:23,515 --> 00:28:25,078
How can I rest?

352
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,235
Next week is Jingnian's birthday.

353
00:28:27,235 --> 00:28:30,319
I knitted one for Nian Nian too.

354
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:41,481
Oh, right. Would you like one too?

355
00:28:42,181 --> 00:28:43,917
No need.

356
00:28:43,917 --> 00:28:46,127
That's right. You two brothers...

357
00:28:46,127 --> 00:28:49,431
it doesn't matter who has it. It's the same thing.

358
00:28:55,481 --> 00:28:56,881
Mom.

359
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:03,384
You'll feel at ease if Jingnian is happy, right?

360
00:29:03,384 --> 00:29:05,281
Of course.

361
00:29:05,281 --> 00:29:07,431
He's the one who worries me the most.

362
00:29:07,431 --> 00:29:12,018
Mainly because his health, ever since he was a child, has been poor.

363
00:29:22,031 --> 00:29:24,731
Mom, don't worry.

364
00:29:24,731 --> 00:29:26,931
Jingnian will be happy.
