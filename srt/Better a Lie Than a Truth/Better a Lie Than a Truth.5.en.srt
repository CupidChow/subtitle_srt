3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,960
You've been looking forever.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,281
Do you want to buy anything or not?

5
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:24,250
I still haven't made up my mind.

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,450
I think this black one is pretty good.

7
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:33,100
But that yellow one... is also nice.

8
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,200
Adults don't need to make choices.

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,130
If you like them, buy them both. I'll pay.

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,430
Are you in love with Lu Jingnian now?

11
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,260
Yes. I like him.

12
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,500
Su Nian! You definitely made the right choice.

13
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,500
Sir, I want the yellow one.

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,520
You are sure, right? Okay.

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,620
Why didn't you say so earlier?

16
00:01:01,298 --> 00:01:04,450
Just get the both of them. They don't cost all that much.

17
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,600
Here!

18
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,980
Mom, what do I do if I go home and then find I like the black one better?

19
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,610
What are you talking about?

20
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,620
Let me tell you, I have a friend who fell in love with two guys at the same time.

21
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,630
She picked one, but she's not sure if she made the right choice.

22
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,870
Nian Nian, you're not talking about yourself, are you?

23
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,450
How is that possible, Mom?

24
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,850
How could that be me...

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,200
I used to have a pond of fish before, too.

26
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,700
Before making anything official,

27
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,520
you can meet more people and see what choices you have.

28
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,590
Find the right person.

29
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,290
It's okay.

30
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,870
But once you're with someone,

31
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,300
then you have to let go of all the other fish

32
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,180
and focus on just that one fish.

33
00:01:52,307 --> 00:01:54,607
I agree.

34
00:01:54,607 --> 00:01:56,710
- Let's go.
- Come on.

35
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,600

Mr. Qiao.

I'm not Qiao Musheng. I'm Lu Jingnian.

38
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,330
I've already changed all the decorations on my desk to ones with warm colors.

39
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,900
But you never liked birthday gifts like Luffy.

40
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,950
Lu Jingnian likes it, so I like it.

41

By the way, help me get rid of all the things that belong to Qiao Musheng.

Also these magazines,

sell them all.

44
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,151
Aren't these your favorites? You are going to give them up just like that?

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,240
They don't matter anymore.

46

Mr. Qiao, what exactly are you doing?

47

Lu Jingnian has quite an easy life.

50
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,648
He just needs to smile and make people happy,

51

- Ah,

I was about to clean out the refrigerator.

55
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,300
Strange.

56
00:03:25,607 --> 00:03:27,707
How should I say it?

57

It's okay. I can get there by myself.

The black one?

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,870
Last night, it jumped out of the tank and died.

It's for Lu Jingnian.

I would like him to put more effort into the company.

Couldn't you just give him another office?

I got used to being alone before.

104
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,148
I would go shopping by myself,

I feel like I don't have to be alone anymore.

I want you to stay by my side.

I'm willing.

From now on, you don't have to take your keys with you when you go out,

Whatever happens to you in the future, you don't have to be afraid.

00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,520
It's not too late for you to know now.

167
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,350
Okay then.

168
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,050
Then... what happens to the company after Qiao Musheng is gone?

169
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,968
I'm here, aren't I?

170
00:13:34,474 --> 00:13:37,283
Shiguang, do you have a problem with me?

171
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,900
Tell me, are you serious?

172
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,380
You are planning to play Lu Jingnian, even in front of me?

173
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,960
That's why you've been acting so weird.

174
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,000
You're going to make Qiao Musheng disappear, right?

175
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,700
This is the best option.

176
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,641
You should get used to it as soon as possible.

177
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:03,630
Lu Jingnian will be showing up more and more often.

178
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,630
But...

179
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:08,000
Okay. You are doing this for Su Nian, that's right!

180
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,900
But if you lie to her your whole life, you'll be the one always in pain!

181
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,160
Then I'll become him completely.

182
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,000
Su Nian, this just arrived from the studio.

183
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,450
They said that Mr. Qiao left it there when he was shooting photos.

184
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,230
- Why don't you give it back to him?
- Okay, thank you.

185
00:14:54,108 --> 00:14:55,240
Hello.

186
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,700
- Hello.
- I'm looking for Mr. Qiao.

187
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,750
I have an urgent manuscript that I need to check with him.

188
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,460
Sorry. Mr. Qiao's schedule is full today.

189
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,943
I know him. I called him before coming here, but no one answered.

190
00:15:03,943 --> 00:15:05,200
Can you check with him for me?

191
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,523
I'm sorry. Mr. Qiao really doesn't have time today.

192
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,008
My photo?

193
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,810
Did Mr. Qiao specifically ask you to stop me here?

194
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,980
Are you really not going to see her?

195
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,670
She's the type of person that won't let things go so easily.

196
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,300
Meeting with her would only complicate things.

197
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,210
Mr. Qiao, it seems that Miss Su has left.

198
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,580
Shiguang, go get some water for the guest.

199
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,990
No one knows her better than you do.

200
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,150
Mr. Qiao, you should take a closer look.

201
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,130
If there are any issues, we can fix it.

202
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,050
This interview was a waste of paper from the beginning.

203
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:37,650
Mr. Qiao, you left your ring at the studio.

204
00:16:39,157 --> 00:16:40,557
That's not mine.

205
00:16:40,557 --> 00:16:43,500
I have work to do. You can go.

206
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,700
Mr. Qiao, have I offended you somehow?

207
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,410
I kept seeing you because you are my sister-in-law.

208
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,298
Now that the interview is over,

209
00:16:53,298 --> 00:16:55,338
things related to work need to follow their protocols.

210
00:16:55,338 --> 00:16:57,960
If it isn't necessary, there's no need to meet.

211
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,620
Is there anything else?

212
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,698
No. You are right. We don't have to meet again.

213
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:17,050
Lu Jingnian asked me to give you this.

214
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:20,500
It's a little late, but happy birthday.

Mom.

223
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,850
Jingnian left his cellphone with me.

224
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,550
Would you please take Jingnian's cellphone back to him?

225
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,100
- You're home.
- Did you visit your brother today?

226
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:34,450
You left your cellphone behind. So careless.

227
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:40,791
It doesn't matter, as long as I don't leave you behind.

228
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,550
I thought you didn't contact each other very often.

229
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:49,500
I went to talk to him about work today.

230
00:18:50,619 --> 00:18:56,400
Your brother told me, starting today, to stop contacting him.

231
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,800
That is just how he is. It's always business with him.

232
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,050
That doesn't mean he has to intentionally be defensive with me, does it?

233
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,048
It is so weird.

234
00:19:05,048 --> 00:19:07,150
Just stop digging and asking so many questions.

235
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,370
What's really that weird about it?

236
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,550
That's not acceptable.

237
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,800
As an editor, when there's something weird

238
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,400
I definitely have to get to the bottom of it.

239
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,420
How could you be so careless?

240
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,350
See? You are always thinking about my brother.

241
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,660
Even my finger has a problem with that.

242
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,860
How did your ring get so large all of a sudden?

243
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,700
I've probably lost some weight recently.

244
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,950
You...

245
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,120
Look at me.

246
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,040
I thought you said we couldn't...

247
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,510
Between you and I...

248
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,900
What is there that we can't do?

249
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,800
Am I right?

250
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,400
What? Are you afraid?

251
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,298
No, of course not.

252
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,800
It's just that...

253
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,900
I think we are moving too fast.

254
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:21,900
Do you mind if I step over the line a little?

255
00:21:23,154 --> 00:21:25,709
No... I don't mind.

256
00:21:59,988 --> 00:22:03,750
You don't have anything else to do today, right? You'll be at home all day?

257
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,998
Of course.

258
00:22:04,998 --> 00:22:07,673
I'll be studying recipes at home all day.

259
00:22:07,673 --> 00:22:09,840
You aren't going to bite me again, are you?

260
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:15,328
Last night, I did overdo it a little.

261
00:22:15,328 --> 00:22:17,950
In the future, I'll be more gentle.

262
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:22,011
Then why... did you do this to me?

263
00:22:22,011 --> 00:22:24,300
I just wanted to test

264
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,300
if you can resist the temptation.

265
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:35,300
Then what if... I can't?

266
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,050
I'm going to work.

267
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,370
You just stay at home and study your recipes.

268
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,250
You said, "don't let her go to the office."

269
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:47,231
But you didn't say that she couldn't come to the escape room.

270
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,100
Last time I made myself really clear.

271
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,700
But I still have a question that I'm really curious about.

272
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,400
I would like it if you could answer me.

273
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,600
Curiosity killed the cat.

274
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,798
Cats have nine lives.

275
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,600
I made a lot of suggestions in the last escape room evaluation.

276
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,750
Shouldn't I be a part of the second evaluation?

277
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,588
Are you sure you can take it?

278
00:24:13,588 --> 00:24:15,200
I'm sure.

279
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,750
Just kill me!

280
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,960
I don't want to be tortured anymore.

281
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,810
Qiao Musheng, let's talk.

282
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,800
We have nothing to talk about.

283
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,100
Qiao Musheng, do you really have nothing to say to me?

284
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,750
No.

285
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:43,950
You really don't have anything to tell me about you and Lu Jingnian?

286
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,800
Su Nian, just stop this nonsense.

287
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,500
Mr. Qiao, please forgive me.

288
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,760
You should know your position. You're my sister-in-law.

289
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,950
Brother, I'm sorry. Lu Jingnian has been so kind to me.

290
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:12,360
I really shouldn't have done this.

291
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,030
- What are you suspecting?
- What are you hiding?

292
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:26,750
Mr. Qiao!

293
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,298
Mr. Qiao... I-I didn't mean to interrupt,

294
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,680
but something happened with your mom at the hospital.

295
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,320
Go get me Jingnian!

296
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,660
I already haven't seen him for such a long time!

297
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,750
She took too many sleeping pills last night,

298
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,060
so she's a little delirious.

299
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,580
She kept refusing to cooperate with the check-up.

300
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,000
Mom,

301
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:50,600
wasn't I here just a few days ago?

302
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:56,540
Not you! Not you!

303
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,910
Mom.

304
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,910
Mom, I'm Nian Nian.

305
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,450
Do you recognize me?

306
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,800
Nian Nian!

307
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,900
Yes! You are Jingnian's wife!

308
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,212
You are my daughter-in-law!

309
00:26:14,212 --> 00:26:18,550
Mom, I'll go bring Lu Jingnian here to you right away. Okay?

310
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,160
Okay.

311
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,160
You two go get him for me.

312
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,062
Bring him here first,

313
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,443
then I'll take my medicine.

314
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,550
Then I'll go pick him up from your place.

315
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,050
Is he at home?

316
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:36,100
Yes. Why don't we go together?

317
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:41,430
What? Is that a problem for you?

318
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,950
No. Let's go together.

319
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,600
Qiao Musheng,

320
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:09,530
aren't you curious how I knew you would be at the escape room today?

321
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:11,500
Shiguang told you.

322
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:20,296
Qiao Musheng, if you are hiding something from me, it is okay to tell me.

323
00:27:20,296 --> 00:27:22,400
We can talk about it.

324
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,890
You don't have to carry everything on your own.

325
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,900
That would be exhausting.

326
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,120
I have nothing to say.

327
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,700
Why don't we call Lu Jingnian?

328
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,200
Okay.

329
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,450
Nian Nian, you are looking for me?

330
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,950
Missed me?

331
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:17,190
Are you at home?

332
00:28:17,675 --> 00:28:20,200
I went to buy groceries. Why?

333
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:23,748
Nothing. Your mom said that she wants to see you.

334
00:28:23,748 --> 00:28:26,600
Your brother and I were coming upstairs to pick you up.

335
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,600
Then wait for me at home. I'll be home soon.

336
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:35,500
Then do me a favor. Go get some puffs.

337
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,350
I have a conference call.

338
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,880
When Jingnian gets here, we'll go together.

339
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,000
I never thought that you could use call forwarding that way.

340
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,600
Fortunately, I brought a sound simulator with me.

341
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,400
Hurry up. It'll only take half an hour at most to buy puffs.

342
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,840
I know. We still have time.

343
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,350
Are you Qiao Musheng or Lu Jingnian?

344
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:32,048
I tried guessing your cellphone password three times,

345
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:36,100
and it turned out to be my birthday.

346
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:39,300
Even the props you got for your act were so real.

347
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,900
That's impressive.

348
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,900
It's not what you think.

349
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,810
Do you know why I went to the escape room this morning?

350
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:53,800
Because Lu Jingnian's cellphone is always with you.

351
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:01,190
[Successfully connected]

352
00:30:01,192 --> 00:30:03,158
I know you suspect me.

353
00:30:03,158 --> 00:30:04,800
I gave you a chance!

354
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,600
Why didn't you come clean with me?

355
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,480
Nian Nian, can we just sit and─

356
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,905
Don't talk to me like Lu Jingnian,

357
00:30:19,905 --> 00:30:23,005
and don't wear Lu Jingnian's clothes!

358
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,000
I can explain!

359
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,700
Who are you exactly?

360
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,700
Are you Qiao Musheng or Lu Jingnian?

361
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,100
Who the hell are you?

362
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:41,150
Give Lu Jingnian back to me, okay?

363
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:44,200
Just give him back to me!

364
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,050
I...

365
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,900
Leave!

366
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,780
Leave now!

367
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,140
♫ It's a miracle that we met ♫

368
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,858
♫ Like two parallel lines intertwined ♫

369
00:31:59,858 --> 00:32:01,830
♫ You walked into my life ♫

370
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:05,280
♫ Going round and round every day ♫

371
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,220
♫ Try to calm my heart, near or far ♫

372
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:12,110
♫ There's an unspoken secret ♫

373
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:14,060
♫ Still constantly missing you a little ♫

374
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:17,440
♫ But I can't let you so easily find that out ♫

375
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,480
♫ Turns out you've been with me ♫

376
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,520
♫ The lies gradually become tenderness ♫

377
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,820
♫ Turning the strange thoughts ♫

378
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:29,620
♫ Into real feelings. Holding your hands ♫

379
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:32,700
♫ In the afternoon while the breeze blows ♫

380
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,620
♫ It's hard to say the words that you really want to say ♫

381
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:40,140
♫ When was it that you quietly walked ♫

382
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:44,000
♫ Into my heart ♫
