[Episode 7]

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,477
What are you doing?

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,992
You've already been suspended. Why are you back here?

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,850
There are cameras here, don't even think about doing anything to me.

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,150
If I want to do something to you, would I fear cameras?

7
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,848
Either you confess to the company

8
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,457
or I'll give this to the police.

9
00:00:31,108 --> 00:00:32,668
It's such an old trick,

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,398
why try using it on me?

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,118
I'm guessing there's a cartoon in there.

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,500
September 21st, 2021, at 13:58,

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,650
you told me the Editor-in-chief asked me to go downstairs to pick up the express delivery.

14
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,800
And then you walked to my desk,

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,250
opened my e-mail with the saved password.

16
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,800
I was just resting at your desk.

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,550
You're still denying it, are you?

18
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,440
There is a hidden camera on my desk.

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,020
Qiao Musheng bought it.

20
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:03,400
My mom said that she wanted to see my face that day, so I...

21
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,350
Okay then. Since you want to be that stubborn,

22
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,750
then I have no choice but to give this to the police.

23
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,900
Don't... don't.

24
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,283
I sent it.

25
00:01:19,283 --> 00:01:21,703
I'll clear it up for you.

26
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,150
Don't worry, I'm not tricking you.

27
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,900
What's inside is definitely not cartoons.

28
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,750
Mr. Qiao, we've dealt with all the trending searches about auntie.

29
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,950
There are no traces of it left.

30
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,210
That article with over 100,000 views has also been revoked because Su Nian asked.

31
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,963
I have also taken the liberty of

32
00:01:49,963 --> 00:01:52,450
dealing with the attacks targeting her on the internet.

33
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,950
What should we do about the 500 or so reposts?

34
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,898
Sue them directly.

35
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,000
Okay.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,198
Mr. Qiao has already made a public statement

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,528
that this had nothing to do with Su Nian.

38
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:09,750
The leadership has also taken emergency measures.

39
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,200
Xiao Meng, do you have anything else to say?

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,530
The leadership has decided to let Xiao Meng go.

41
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,850
Don't be too sad.

42
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,200
You still have a long way to go.

43
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,583
Is that all?

44
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,790
Editor-in-chief, you really did clear yourself of this entire mess.

45
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,860
Xiao Meng, when you do something wrong, you need to admit it.

46
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,802
Don't try to push it on others!

47
00:02:40,802 --> 00:02:44,300
Editor-in-chief, it isn't reasonable to blame it all on me when things went wrong.

48
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,186
When it comes to this matter, you weren't short of ideas either!

49
00:02:47,186 --> 00:02:49,380
Get ready for what's going to happen.

50
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,150
This is the scarf that I made for you.

51
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,498
I know that you always think I favor Jingnian.

52
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,477
Technically, you are not wrong.

53
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,800
He has been in poor health ever since he was a child. I always wanted to give him more attention.

54
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,498
And then something like that happened,

55
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,862
I just couldn't accept it.

56
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:34,077
So I selfishly made you pretend to be another person for so many years.

57
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,310
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,244
You don't have to forgive me.

59
00:03:48,244 --> 00:03:51,200
I can't even forgive myself.

60
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,180
Mom,

61
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,549
that's all behind us now.

62
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:01,230
But it's not true to say that I don't love you.

63
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,498
When they said that you were a monster,

64
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,200
I was so heartbroken.

65
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,240
But I didn't know how to help you.

66
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,000
I was a coward.

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,685
I chose to run away.

68
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,402
Actually...

69
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,869
only a few people can be brave all the time.

70
00:04:30,869 --> 00:04:32,716
I can understand.

71
00:04:36,207 --> 00:04:38,955
But I won't run again.

72
00:04:38,955 --> 00:04:41,790
Can you give me another chance?

73
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,939
I know about you and Su Nian.

74
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,720
She's a good girl,

75
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,028
and she even spoke up for you like that.

76
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,903
Don't let her go.

77
00:05:12,903 --> 00:05:14,700
But...

78
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,390
She doesn't like me anymore.

79
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,070
Mr. Qiao, I accidentally rejected one of your e-mails.

80
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,636
What e-mail?

81
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,276
It's an invitation to a high school reunion.

82
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,994
I'm not going.

83
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:46,500
It seems that Su Nian is going.

84
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,751
I saw the pin in her (WeChat) Moments.

85
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,100
It's such a good chance to see her, you might regret it if you miss it.

86
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,840
Come on!

87
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,580
Cheers! Here! Drink up!

88
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,940
Come on, let's have one.

89
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,670
Come on, drink up!

90
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,430
- One more time!
- One more time!

91
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,800
Cheers!

92
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,660
We should get together more often.

93
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,900
What?

94
00:06:17,902 --> 00:06:19,618
Are you looking for Su Nian?

95
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,100
I heard that she came for a short time and then left.

96
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,294
I don't know where she went either.

97
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,726
Are you still in touch?

98
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,150
- Sort of.
- That's great!

99
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,050
I have something I wanted to give her.

100
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,378
But it seems right to give it to you.

101
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,803
Back then, Su Nian got drunk and fell asleep on the table.
[Su Nian]

102
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:41,460
It was Liu Xing who took the love letter.
[Su Nian]

103
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,948
He pinned it to the wall.

104
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,840
I didn't dare stop him at the time,

105
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,048
so I just retrieved it.

106
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,680

Qiao Musheng came right after you left.

115
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:14,330
It's a shame not seeing you two at the same time.

116
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:18,650
I don't know Qiao Musheng... that well anymore.

117
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:21,140
If we're not meant to be, that's fine.

You all have fun.

Let me introduce myself again.

121
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,988
My name is Zhao Yunduan. I'm a photographer.

122
00:08:47,988 --> 00:08:50,490
I have never been in a serious relationship before.

123
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,948
Now I would like to get to know you, seriously.

124
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,950
Miss Su Nian.

125
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,540
You are the blind date that my mom arranged for me?

126
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,320
The way you are acting, it is like we are getting to know each other again.

127
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,540
You look pretty good.

128
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,980
In that case, can I have the pleasure

129
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,140
of showing you around and making you happy?

130
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,360
Okay. If you can't make me happy,

131
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,369
then I won't make it easy for you.

132
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,560
Okay.

133
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,772
Delicious?

134
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:26,590
I'll take you there again.

135
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:30,420
Nian Nian, I talked to Auntie already.

136
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,380
I think she's right, and I don't mind being your rebound.

137
00:09:35,288 --> 00:09:39,288
But... It's not fair to you.

138
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,790
Also we are good friends.

139
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,990
I don't have a lack of good friends,

140
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,440
what I don't have is a girlfriend.

141
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,040
And I don't need fairness.

142
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,800
You are putting me in a hard spot.

143
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,090
So... Do you have someone on your mind now?

144
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:04,240
If you don't, why not give it a try with me?

145
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,090
I object.

146
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,114
Qiao Musheng, it is over between the two of us already.

147
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,340
No, we still have a long way to go.

148
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,250
Su Nian, I want to tell you that I don't want to give up.

149
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,350
When we were in school, I didn't try all the way to the end.

150
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,497
I definitely won't be letting you go again.

151
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:31,490
I'm still breathing, who gave you the right to pursue her?

152
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,350
Come on, I'll drive you home.

153
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,775
I'll drive you home!

154
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:37,320
No chance. You are a bad driver.

155
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,520
- I'm taking the subway.
- I'm taking the subway, too.
- I'm taking the subway, too.

156
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,020
Nian Nian!

157
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,340
It's so early, it's not even light out yet. What are you doing here?

158
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,990
I need to meet with someone in your company,

159
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,805
I want to go there with you.

160
00:11:03,805 --> 00:11:05,900
Don't you have a car? Go by yourself.

161
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,902
Shiguang told me to say that something was wrong with my car.

162
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,080
But there wasn't.

163
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:13,440
And then, I somehow ended up here.

164
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,330
Thank you.

165
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,330
Su Nian, congratulations! You are the Editor-in-chief now!

166
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,150
Although you are just stepping in for now,

167
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:51,600
I believe that this position will definitely be yours after you come back from the training course!

168
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,640
- Congratulations!
- It's not a big deal. Not a big deal.

169
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,550
Everyone, get back to work. Please.

170
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,450
Okay!

171
00:12:07,558 --> 00:12:10,460
I'll be your person from today onward, Editor-in-chief Su.

172
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,345
What exactly do you want?

173
00:12:12,345 --> 00:12:14,040
I want to develop a new escape room theme.

174
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,740
I'm here to do research.

175
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,330
What theme are you going to develop this time?

176
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,592
Love.

177
00:12:19,592 --> 00:12:22,552
I want to practice how to get my girlfriend back.

178
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,080
Mr. Qiao, do you need me to show you around the company?

179
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,412
I'm an administrative assistant here.

180
00:12:30,412 --> 00:12:32,676
I'm familiar with every corner here.

181
00:12:32,676 --> 00:12:34,456
I'm Editor-in-chief Su's person.

182
00:12:34,456 --> 00:12:36,394
I'll be her responsibility.

183
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,500
Editor-in-chief, you can arrange tasks for me.

184
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,190
I want to get an interview with Wu Tiaohui. You remember him, right?

185
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:53,338
It's so hard to get an appointment with him. Most people can't do that.

186
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,890
Ask around about that for me.

187
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,460
I have made an appointment for you. Tomorrow evening.

188
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,058
Anything you want me to do is up to you.

189
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,300
You've been feeding the fish for so long that it's going to die from eating too much.

190
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,300
Hurry up and go home.

191
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,315
I really like fish.

192
00:13:39,315 --> 00:13:42,840
You spoke up for me the last time because of some fish.

193
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,690
That's all in the past, stop mentioning it.

194
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,586
How are the fish at home?

195
00:13:50,586 --> 00:13:52,780
I miss them.

196
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,890
They don't miss you. Just go back.

197
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:59,340
Then at least let me fill this water bottle for you before I go.

198
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,390
Go ahead.

199
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,740
Take your time. I'm leaving.

200
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,740
I'm leaving now.

201
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:53,298
I just called a cab, but there are over a hundred people in front of me.

202
00:14:53,298 --> 00:14:55,038
Then ask Shiguang to pick you up.

203
00:14:55,038 --> 00:14:57,590
He's on a business trip.

204
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,545
My home is so far away from here.

205
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,502
Can you take me in for a night?

206
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:03,602
No!

207
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,590
Okay. Okay.

208
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,240
You forgot your keys again.

209
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,437
If I wasn't here, you would be in trouble again.

210
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,650
Give it back! Who told you that you could keep the key to my place?

211
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,382
The water is so cloudy.

212
00:15:44,382 --> 00:15:46,460
How long has it been since the water was changed?

213
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,949
I'm sorry for your suffering.

214
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,420
Don't you need to go buy some things?

215
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,120
I have nothing that you can use at home.

216
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,550
Shiguang will ask someone to bring it to me.

217
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,390
You... are only staying for just one night,

218
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:21,090
do you need that many things?

219
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:24,488
Shiguang got it wrong. I'll deduct his salary.

220
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,077
- Good night.
- Good night.

221
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:52,290
Do you have to make such a big deal, meeting with Wu Tiaohui?

222
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:56,388
Of course! He is my idol!

223
00:16:56,388 --> 00:16:58,720
It's not like you haven't read his novel before.

224
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,160
He's one word. Amazing.

225
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,188
Right, when are you planning on leaving?

226
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,680
Shiguang will take you to meet your idol first

227
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,240
and then pick me up when you get back.

228
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,150
Have some dinner before you go.

229
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,090
No, I'm good. I have to get there soon.

230
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,390
I'll wait for...

231
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,670
This is the place where Mr. Wu Tiaohui wanted to meet?

232
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,540
Nice to meet you, Miss Su. Let me introduce myself again.

233
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,540
I'm Wu Tiaohui.

234
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,040
I'm flattered that you and Mr. Qiao both like my novel.

235
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,540
But I'm afraid,

236
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,540
- I can't do the interview today.
- Why?

237
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,188
Because it's a special day.

238
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,490
You'll understand when you get to the newsstand.

239
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,620
Newsstand?

240
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,440
[Eight Years Ago]

241
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,290
Big Mang, ever since I spoke up for Qiao Musheng,
[Eight Years Ago]

242
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,390
that Liu Xing has kept saying things about Qiao Musheng and me.

243
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:18,140
As a part of the disciplinary committee, shouldn't you do something?

244
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:25,660
Owner! Do you have the newest magazine?

245
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,760
This is the last copy.

246
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,550
A boy asked me to keep it for you,

247
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:31,390
and he told me to keep it a secret with a sour look on his face.

248
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,590
Qiao Musheng!

249
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,340
Are you Su Nian?

250
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,922
This is the last copy of Wu Tiaohui's series.

251
00:19:09,922 --> 00:19:12,242
A boy asked to keep this for you.

252
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,290
What are you doing exactly?

253
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:28,040
Today is the sixth anniversary of his love letter getting exposed.

254
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,980
Actually, he has always been a coward.

255
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,290
He couldn't believe that someone would like Qiao Musheng,

256
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,701
so he lied to you.

257
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:43,490
Back then, he wouldn't let himself believe that he could feel things.

258
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:47,040
So a misunderstanding made him deny everything.

259
00:19:48,151 --> 00:19:50,340
You are the one who always believed in him.

260
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,988
Thank you.

261
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,890
And I'm sorry.

262
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,120
So, does he really know that he made a mistake?

263
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,910
He does!

264
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,720
For Su Nian and for himself,

265
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,300
he wants to become a brand new Qiao Musheng.

266
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,030
Su Nian...

267
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,990
are you willing to give Qiao Musheng another chance?

268
00:20:31,455 --> 00:20:33,600
I do.

269
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,620
♫ I want to escape this world ♫

270
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,280
♫ Touching the edges of a mistake ♫

271
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,818
♫ Will you understand? ♫

272
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,268
♫ All the happenings in my heart ♫

273
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:52,250
♫ The broken promises ♫

274
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,660
♫ But you're my light ♫

275
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:00,150
♫ Just need your care and love ♫

276
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:04,060
♫ To fill in all my vacancies ♫

277
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:12,470
In-law, on another day, when you are free, come to my place and try some of my cooking.

278
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:15,110
All right! I'll definitely be there.

279
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,050
Qiao, congratulations! Congratulations!

280
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:23,638
- You are so handsome.
- Nian Nian, this one is more handsome than the last one.

281
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,430
Well done.

282
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,470
- Well done, well done.
- Well done.

283
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,840
Please, come inside. Come inside.

284
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,940
Should I feel happy or upset?

285
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,090
You tell me!

286
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,240
Stop eating, In-law!

287
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,670
Do you still want to take care of your grandchildren?

288
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,102
I'll share it with them.

289
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,990
Loosen up your smile to look more natural.

290
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,770
Why have you returned to your old self all of a sudden?

291
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,570
Your acting was pretty good before, wasn't it?

292
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,580
I'm not acting. I'm nervous.

293
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,840
Okay, fine. You are too normal now, I'm not quite used to it.

294
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,990
Why are you here?

295
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:18,100
To take the bride.

296
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,238
Mr. Qiao, he's joking.

297
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,690
Su Nian asked Yunduan to take photos for the wedding. I'm his assistant.

298
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,290
Congratulations to you both.

299
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:30,240
The ceremony begins in 10 minutes.

300
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,040
You are a human being now

301
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,763
and a happy man at that.

302
00:22:38,763 --> 00:22:42,840
The part where you welcome the guests is over.
Now change your clothes and go see your wife.

303
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,740
In-law, keep an eye open for me too if you can.

304
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,140
I also want to experience love in the twilight years.

305
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,460
[Su Nian]

306
00:23:38,158 --> 00:23:39,938
The day we graduated from high school,

307
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,990
this love letter encountered an accident.

308
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,690
Now, I would like to give it to you again.

309
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,040
Su Nian,

310
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,740
I don't know why I'm writing this letter.

311
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,740
I just know that I feel pain when I see you.

312
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,180
I feel pain when I see you unable to buy the things you want.

313
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,528
I feel pain when I see you unhappy.

314
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,090
It's so annoying.

315
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,820
I hope that you can solve my problem.

316
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,840
Stop reading it.

317
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,940
I remember the rest of it.

318
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,860
Especially the dozen wrong words.

319
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:24,540
But now I know, all those moments of pain or annoyance

320
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,608
was because... I love you.

321
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,890
Darling, don't drink anymore. Okay?

322
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,690
You can read the love letter by yourself.

323
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:56,170
Then you can drink the cross-cupped wine by yourself.

324
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,096
Look at this situation.

325
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:59,390
I won't lose this ring again.

326
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,890
I won't give you a chance to.

327
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,880
[I like you, too]

328
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:16,658
I'll be gone for a long time at this training course. You won't even see me off.

329
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,540
My friends abroad will take care of you.

330
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:21,640
Besides, you were the one who wanted to go.

331
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,700
Then I won't go, okay?

332
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,720
A woman's words are as untrustworthy as ghosts.

333
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,900
Hurry up. You are running late.

334
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,440
Listen, Qiao Musheng.

335
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,340
I became your assistant to experience life for my new book.

336
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,350
I'm already halfway through the book, can you take your wife to the airport yourself?

337
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,880
Exactly.

338
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,530
I have work to do. Don't you know that?

339
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:43,080
Besides, don't you want your newly released toy anymore?

340
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,690
Outrageous!

341
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,550
[Singapore]

342
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,790
My class is over. What are you doing?

343
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,490
Hey there!

344
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:49,490
Student, you look a little familiar.

345
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:53,600
Are you the one on my marriage certificate?

346
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,830
If I could have such an amazing wife, I would follow her everywhere.

347
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,140
Who refused to see me off back then?

348
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:08,040
I was trying to finish my work earlier.

349
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,198
Otherwise, how could I be here for you?

350
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,840
Saying one thing, meaning another.

351
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,240
You clearly missed me.

352
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:20,920
That's right. I can't bear to leave you.
