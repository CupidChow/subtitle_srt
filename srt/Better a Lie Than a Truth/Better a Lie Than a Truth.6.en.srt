Why don't we call Lu Jingnian?

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,250
Okay.

5
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,550
Nian Nian, you are looking for me?

6
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,350
Missed me?

7
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,124
Are you at home?

8
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,300
I went to buy groceries. Why?

9
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,298
Nothing.

10
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,700
Your mom said that she wants to see you.

11
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,650
Your brother and I were coming upstairs to pick you up.

12
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,600
Then wait for me at home. I'll be home soon.

13
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,450
Then do me a favor. Go get some puffs.

14
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,350
I have a conference call.

15
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,950
When Jingnian gets here, we'll go together.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,120
I never thought that you could use call forwarding that way.

17
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,748
Fortunately, I brought a sound simulator with me.

18
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,840
Hurry up.

19
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,500
It'll only take half an hour at most to buy puffs.

20
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,000

Are you Qiao Musheng or Lu Jingnian?

22
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,100
I tried guessing your cellphone password three times,

23
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,050
and it turned out to be my birthday.

24
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,200
Even the props you got for your act were so real.

25
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,850
That's impressive.

Do you know why I went to the escape room this morning?

28
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,550

Don't talk to me like Lu Jingnian,

35

and don't wear Lu Jingnian's clothes.

Remember to lock both doors before going to sleep.

Mom, have you ever considered what Qiao Musheng must be feeling?

255
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,520
Nian Nian, you don't have children yet.

256

When you do, then you'll understand me.

257
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:10,260
Just because I don't have children doesn't mean I don't understand.

258
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,350
I know it must be painful for you to have lost Lu Jingnian.

259
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,798
But what about Qiao Musheng?

260
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,040
He also lost his own brother,

261
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,498
and he has to pretend that he's Lu Jingnian to see you.

262
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,030
Isn't he suffering? Isn't he feeling sad too?

263
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:25,710
Whether he's suffering or not, he's still alive!

264
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,548
But my Jingnian

265
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,540
is dead already.

266
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:37,980
I think about Jingnian every day.

267
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,660
Ever since he was a child, he was in poor health.

268
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,000
He was still so young.

269
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:50,450
It was my fault for not taking care of him.

270
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,650
I just want to see my child.

271
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,932
Is that so wrong?

272
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,937
Then what about Qiao Musheng?

273
00:24:01,937 --> 00:24:04,600
What has he done wrong?

274
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,420
He kept playing Lu Jingnian to please you,

275
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,750
but he never got the love that he deserves.

276
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:20,380
He is independent and reasonable. He can still live a good life without me.

277
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:25,200
But I can't live without Jingnian.

278
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:36,120
So you don't care at all if Qiao Musheng exists or not, is that right?

279
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,950
You are too selfish! You're pushing him into hell!

280
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:45,500
Do you know that? He'll seal himself up forever.

281
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:59,695
Actually, Qiao Musheng already saw you at the cemetery the other day.

282
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,000
But he is still acting for your sake.

283
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,200
Thank you. For what you said on my behalf.

284
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,450
But it isn't necessary anymore.

285
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:56,300
If I didn't say something, are you going to keep on acting?

286
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,600
That's the only thing I can do.

287
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,800
If even you don't care about yourself,

288
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,732
then no one will care about you.

289
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:18,300
Just think of me as a busybody.
