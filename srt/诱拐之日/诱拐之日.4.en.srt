00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,695
YOUNGIN POLICE STATION

6
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:11,489
<i>It's been six days since the kidnapping.</i>

7
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:13,407
<i>It's well past the golden hour,</i>

8
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:17,620
<i>but as you can see, the kidnapper
has no intention of hurting the kid.</i>

9
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,663
<i>The kidnapper and the victim</i>

10
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:21,778
<i>look close to each other, right?</i>

11
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,294
I mean, she's still a kid.

12
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:30,299
He might've told her
that he was her uncle or her dad's friend.

13
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:34,595
Choi Ro-hee is a genius who joined MENSA
at the youngest age in the country.

14
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:37,765
I doubt she'd be gullible enough
to fall for that.

15
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:40,267
On May 25th, around 7:00 p.m.,

16
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:43,312
Kim Myeong-jun rushed into the ER
with the girl on his back.

17
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:46,106
According to the nurses,

18
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,400
the child referred to him as her dad.

19
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:50,653
How did he trick her?

20
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:53,697
She's just an 11-year-old girl.

21
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:54,949
Murder?

22
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,992
Kim Myeong-jun has a record?

23
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,288
Yes. He was an athlete
who tried out for the Judo national team.

24
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,166
Back then, his nickname was "Monster."

25
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,669
He killed his opponent during a game?

26
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:08,796
So he's a monster?

27
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:13,467
The monster and the genius child.

28
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,511
We don't know
what Kim Myeong-jun is after,

29
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:19,306
but we cannot rule out the fact
that he can pose a threat to Choi Ro-hee

30
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,392
at any given moment.

31
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:28,023
CHAPTER 4. THE MONSTER

32
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,055
BASED ON THE NOVEL
<i>THE DAY OF KIDNAPPING</i> BY JEONG HAE-YEON

33
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:41,662
Wake up.

34
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,372
Wake up already.

35
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:46,292
Wake up.

36
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,712
Wake up!

37
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:51,422
Wake up already!

38
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,924
Wake up!

39
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,634
What's with you?

40
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:58,387
Well, aren't you relaxed?

41
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:59,638
You must've slept well.

42
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,682
Get up and eat.

43
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,101
What?

44
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:15,946
What about you?

45
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,656
I'm fine. Eat up.

46
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,081
Why aren't you eating?

47
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,250
Try it first.

48
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:31,503
Okay.

49
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,383
How is it?

50
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,929
It's good.

51
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,764
That's not what I'm asking.

52
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:45,267
Do you feel your tongue retracting
and your throat tightening?

53
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:47,603
Or do you feel dizzy at all?

54
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:49,229
What?

55
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,775
Why aren't you eating? You should eat too.

56
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:56,487
Jeez. It's fine, just eat.

57
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:57,613
It's good.

58
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:01,158
Goodness.

59
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,078
It's been a while

60
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,372
since I had <i>doenjang jjigae </i>you made.

61
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:09,505
I'm not sure
if it'll taste like it did before.

62
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,159
Use it for the time being.
I'm sorry I can't give you much.

63
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:27,643
What's this all of a sudden?

64
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,687
Are you kicking us out?

65
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:33,107
Then did you expect to stay here?

66
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:37,611
If the police find out you came to Seoul,
where do you think they'll search first?

67
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:38,946
You think this place is safe?

68
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,952
Change into new clothes after you eat.

69
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,954
I bought some early in the morning.

70
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:49,915
Okay. Thanks.

71
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,962
You're an accomplice.

72
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,045
She's not.

73
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,174
This was my plan,
and I carried it out alone.

74
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:03,386
What's going on here?

75
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:07,558
Did you two plan something behind my back?

76
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,895
One of us has to look after Hee-ae.

77
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:17,860
Are you kidding me right now?

78
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:22,239
YOUNGIN POLICE STATION

79
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:38,172
Hey.

80
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,675
A civil servant shouldn't sleep past noon.

81
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:47,306
I went to sleep at 9:00 a.m. today.

82
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,725
So it's about time I get up.

83
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:55,397
What brings you here?

84
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,441
I was going to call,

85
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,944
but I wanted to talk to you
over a cup of coffee.

86
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,448
Right, the materials you gave me.

87
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,575
Dr. Choi Jin-tae's notes.

88
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,619
Did you find anything?

89
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,538
They're just a bunch of medical records,
nothing special.

90
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:13,665
But one of the pages is strange.

91
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:18,879
Here. At the end of the page.

92
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:22,591
I'm not certain yet.

93
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,968
- I may be wrong.
- Okay.

94
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,762
But based on what I know,

95
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:30,557
there's only one case where these acronyms
are used all at once.

96
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,020
Head?

97
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:36,104
Brain?

98
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,649
This may be an important key.

99
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,085
Are you still suspicious of Hye-eun?

100
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:03,715
There are more reasons
to be suspicious than not.

101
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:08,929
Why?

102
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:12,933
If she isn't the murderer, is it you?

103
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,018
This is good. You want some?

104
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,228
Forget it.

105
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,063
You can have all of it.

106
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,853
Hey, do we have to take it this far?

107
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,897
We need to know who she's meeting.

108
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:03,442
Who knows? She might meet a cop
behind our back.

109
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,528
A cop? Why?

110
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:09,031
You said you agreed to take all the blame.

111
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:10,949
Maybe she's turning you in.

112
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:12,159
Hello.

113
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,802
- Thank you for waiting.
- Someone's here.

114
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:14,953
- Please take a seat.
- Okay.

115
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:18,999
Have you been well?

116
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,500
- Yes.
- You look well.

117
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:21,584
What's going on?

118
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,295
Is she on a blind date?

119
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:27,674
Are you okay?

120
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,927
Why wouldn't I be?

121
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,471
We're completely cool.

122
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,973
There's nothing to be okay
or not okay about.

123
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:36,266
My goodness.

124
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:37,851
It's hot and stuffy in here.

125
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,938
Why am I so thirsty?

126
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:42,940
Why are you drinking mine?

127
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:44,983
I paid for it.

128
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,443
I understand.

129
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,488
I'm sure you're furious inside.

130
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,448
Drink up.

131
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,408
Drink everything, okay?

132
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:54,952
Forget it.

133
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,536
I don't need it.

134
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,251
Damn it.

135
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:03,752
Who the hell is he?

136
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:12,802
Let's go.

137
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,310
Go.

138
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:23,438
Come on.

139
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,407
- Let's go.
- Okay.

140
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,288
HANKOOK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

141
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,622
So what's the illness?

142
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:42,207
What do you mean? I'm not sick.

143
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,375
Not you.

144
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,003
Oh, you mean Hye-eun?

145
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,087
I don't know.

146
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,423
Why did I even ask?

147
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,843
Why did you ask me if Hye-eun is ill?

148
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:53,969
We're at a hospital.

149
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:58,473
Oh, this is a hospital.

150
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:00,809
What? Where did they go?

151
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:03,020
Why would she come...

152
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:12,863
Did they go in here?

153
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:14,948
I think they came this way.

154
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:16,908
"Infectious disease"?

155
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,411
What do they specialize in?

156
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,079
Isn't it obvious?

157
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,915
You come here when you catch
an infectious disease.

158
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:37,846
Is it not this way?

159
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:39,639
Let's go the other way.

160
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,833
- Goodness.
- Great job.

161
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,252
Great job!

162
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:16,259
It feels like time has traveled faster
since my retirement.

163
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:21,765
I don't even know how much time flies
when I watch my grandson play.

164
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:26,186
We're here to ask you
about Dr. Choi Jin-tae,

165
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,687
who recently passed away.

166
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,438
Right.

167
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:31,233
I watched the news.

168
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,069
He had a bright future ahead of him.

169
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,654
It's such a shame.

170
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:39,533
You wired a huge amount to him.

171
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,034
Could you please explain?

172
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,502
TRANSACTION RECORD

173
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:51,753
I made an investment.

174
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:55,507
Dr. Choi was a competent doctor.

175
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,642
He was developing
a new surgical methodology.

176
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,317
And I trusted him, so I invested in him.

177
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,554
A new surgical methodology?

178
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:02,889
What kind of surgery?

179
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,725
I don't know the details.

180
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,148
You decided to invest two billion won
without knowing the new method?

181
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:18,363
I founded Mihan Pharmaceutical
when I was 29,

182
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:21,783
and made it the biggest
pharmaceutical company in Korea.

183
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:24,202
I volunteered in the medical field
all my life.

184
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:25,495
So is it wrong for me

185
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,415
to invest in someone as competent
and promising as Dr. Choi?

186
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:30,834
What if that doctor was our future?

187
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,420
What if that doctor
could change the world?

188
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,990
Then I'd be happy to invest
even more than two billion won.

189
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,050
All right then.

190
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,095
Next time, please follow the procedure

191
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:44,179
and contact the legal team
at Mihan Pharmaceutical.

192
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,432
I expected it,

193
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,935
but a meeting like today
isn't entirely pleasant for me.

194
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,816
Goodness, my sweet grandson.

195
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,402
Look at you riding the horse.

196
00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,446
Come here.

197
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:04,117
An investment of two billion won
without knowing the details?

198
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:06,077
And he invested it willingly?

199
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,830
What is he hiding?

200
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,166
This is making me more curious.

201
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,711
What kind of research was he conducting

202
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,047
that both Dr. Mo Eun-sun
and Chairman Park Gi-sun

203
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,133
believed it would change the world
and the future?

204
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,028
They came by.

205
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:42,906
I did as you told me to.

206
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,034
We have to find Ro-hee

207
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:48,370
before the police do.

208
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,623
You're still doubting me, aren't you?

209
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,709
If I tell you my alibi,
will you believe me?

210
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,130
According to the news,

211
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:02,592
your parents died on the 21st.

212
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,428
I was hospitalized on that day.

213
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:07,013
Hospitalized?

214
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,932
Why? Are you sick?

215
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,352
I applied to be in a clinical trial.

216
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,229
What clinical trial?

217
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,773
Why? What is it?

218
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:22,737
I have HIV.

219
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:25,907
HIV?

220
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,287
What's that?

221
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:34,332
It's a virus that causes AIDS.

222
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,458
AIDS?

223
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,337
HIV. Human immunodeficiency virus.

224
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:43,133
That virus is the cause of many
infectious diseases, including AIDS.

225
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:46,595
So stop humiliating her
and lower your voice.

226
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,015
She's right.

227
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:54,019
And I'm currently getting treated
to delay contracting AIDS.

228
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,315
Why? What happened?

229
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,570
<i>I found out by chance.</i>

230
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:07,971
<i>It was around when Hee-ae was three.</i>

231
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:09,826
<i>I couldn't recover from a cold,</i>

232
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,762
<i>so I thought there was an issue
with my immune system.</i>

233
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,039
<i>I went to the hospital
and had my blood tested.</i>

234
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:16,708
<i>That's when I found out</i>

235
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,419
<i>that I have HIV.</i>

236
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:32,557
Hold on. That means...

237
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,769
- Does that mean Hee-ae...
- No.

238
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:39,606
Hee-ae is okay.
I got her tested right away.

239
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:44,319
Nothing was wrong with Hee-ae,
so don't worry about her.

240
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,287
Why didn't you tell me?

241
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,083
If I told you,

242
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,419
could you have left me?

243
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,342
You can never abandon me.

244
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:08,843
Never.

245
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:13,807
But I couldn't let Hee-ae
live as a daughter of an AIDS patient.

246
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:18,019
If people found out,
they would point fingers at her.

247
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:22,148
It was overwhelming to constantly
clean, disinfect, and be on my toes

248
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:23,900
in case she would get infected.

249
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,036
I'm sorry I left you...

250
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,458
after wrecking everything.

251
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:46,548
But please believe me...

252
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,720
when I say...

253
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:56,474
that it was the best choice
I could make back then.

254
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:12,991
Any more questions?

255
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,035
If you want to check

256
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:19,205
if I was hospitalized
on the night of the 21st,

257
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:22,125
I can get
the hospitalization records for you.

258
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:25,587
Yes.

259
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,338
I have more questions.

260
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,157
I'll tell you if I have the answer.

261
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,343
I don't understand

262
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,554
that I was abused.

263
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,766
There are no injuries on my body.

264
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,435
I know I lost my memories,

265
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,520
but I don't recall anything
about getting abused.

266
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:44,689
The only traces left on my body

267
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,735
are needle marks that are bruised.

268
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:52,405
You need to elaborate if you want me
to believe that I was abused.

269
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,993
The reason why my dad
wouldn't have reported me missing

270
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:59,162
isn't just because of child abuse, right?

271
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:01,456
Tell me.

272
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,834
What child abuse
are you referring to exactly?

273
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:07,170
Do you really want to know?

274
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,797
If you know the truth, yes.

275
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,174
You were

276
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:13,927
the subject of an experiment...

277
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,889
that your dad was conducting.

278
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,892
What? What do you mean by that?

279
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:24,437
I guess you weren't ready to hear that.

280
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,523
Hold on. That's ridiculous.

281
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,942
He conducted an experiment
on his own daughter?

282
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:32,070
That's why I told you
he wouldn't report her missing.

283
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:35,198
As soon as I heard Hee-ae had leukemia,

284
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,784
I went to all the prominent hospitals
in the country.

285
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,410
I wanted to do something.

286
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:42,705
Then I visited Hyekwang Hospital
and overheard something.

287
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,208
The Genius Child Project.

288
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:52,465
Your dad

289
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,510
collected an astronomical amount
of investments with that project

290
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:58,847
since the experiment was quite a success.

291
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,642
And I was after that investment money.

292
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,604
If you kept her for a few days,

293
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:09,732
I thought we'd be able to safely
get the money from them.

294
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,652
Dr. Choi wouldn't have been
able to report it to the police

295
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,237
or tell the press about it.

296
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:18,533
On top of that, he needed you
in order to complete the experiment.

297
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:21,828
Then comes the murder.

298
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,163
I really didn't expect

299
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,875
things to spiral out of control.

300
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,057
- Kim Myeong-jun.
- Yes?

301
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:45,351
Let's turn ourselves in.

302
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:46,728
Both of us?

303
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,355
I'm going to turn myself in too.

304
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,858
If we turn ourselves in,

305
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,943
the kidnapping case will close.

306
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,609
That means the police
will focus on the murder case.

307
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,710
Then the murderer
will be caught in no time

308
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,075
and she'll stop accusing me of...

309
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,493
But the culprit is a cop...

310
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:08,875
I'm sorry...

311
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:12,837
for being so greedy

312
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,673
and making you be a part of it.

313
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:19,636
So let's end things here.

314
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,641
What about Hee-ae?

315
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,395
She's alone in the hospital.

316
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:34,525
No.

317
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:39,572
You stay put.

318
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,316
This is mine to take care of.

319
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,660
Let's stick to our agreement.

320
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,122
This is mine to bear.

321
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:49,832
Myeong-jun.

322
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:50,959
We can't let

323
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,711
Hee-ae be raised in an orphanage as well.

324
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,390
I know their names very well.

325
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,558
They're very famous figures.

326
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:09,328
CHOI GI-SUN
FOUNDER OF MIHAN PHARMACEUTICALS

327
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:11,187
MO EUN-SUN
DIRECTOR OF ES HOSPITAL

328
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:13,648
But I don't think this project

329
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,900
is under official research
of our hospital.

330
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,987
If it's a big project
that involves big money like that,

331
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,697
I would know.

332
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:24,033
Are you saying it's his personal research?

333
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,997
If they said so, then yes.

334
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,417
He conducted a lot of personal research,

335
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:35,314
to the point where he put
our hospital work on the back burner.

336
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,757
He even put the hospital work
on the back burner?

337
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:43,302
He was obsessed with research.
He was a research freak.

338
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,472
That's what people called him.

339
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,975
And he kept all of them to himself,

340
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,977
so not a single soul knew

341
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:52,979
what he was researching.

342
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,527
Thank you for making time
despite your busy schedule.

343
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:00,862
It's all right.

344
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:04,407
As you can see, we have had fewer patients
since the incident.

345
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:07,744
Hello, Mr. Park.

346
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,664
Please come by for a cup of coffee
after the maintenance.

347
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:13,624
Don't just leave like last time.

348
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:14,709
Sure.

349
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:19,422
Keep up the good work.

350
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:24,135
You two must be close.

351
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,344
Not really.

352
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:27,513
I smoke,

353
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:31,350
and Mr. Park is the only person
who smokes with me.

354
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:35,063
He must be good at his job

355
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:38,608
seeing that Dr. Choi put him in charge of
the CCTVs in this house.

356
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:40,860
Mr. Park insisted.

357
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:42,361
Sorry?

358
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:44,197
Dr. Choi didn't ask him first?

359
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,034
Mr. Park did a lot of sales work
to do better in his performance reviews.

360
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:51,204
I introduced him to Dr. Choi.

361
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,414
When he became in charge of
Dr. Choi's house,

362
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:55,416
he bought me a drink to thank me.

363
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:57,209
I'll be on my way then.

364
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,058
Here.

365
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:14,644
These are his personal information
and service records.

366
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,564
Did he cause trouble or something?

367
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:21,275
No, we're just investigating.

368
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:23,027
Right?

369
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,111
I knew it.

370
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,281
He worked here for ten years.
He must be a veteran.

371
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:28,491
Yes, it's been long.

372
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:31,410
He gets along well with people
and is good at his job.

373
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:32,894
And he also has good sales records.

374
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,581
Was he in the sales team before?

375
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:36,665
Yes.

376
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:39,710
It's been two years
since he took on fieldwork.

377
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,214
Two years?

378
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:46,300
It's been about two years
since I was in charge of his hospital.

379
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:48,052
But he called me about a year ago

380
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:50,263
and said that he'd prefer
to have one person

381
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,598
managing his hospital and his house.

382
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:55,009
<i>So I've been in charge
of his house as well since then.</i>

383
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:01,691
JANUARY 25, 2013: JOINED THE SALES TEAM

384
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,652
The timing fits perfectly

385
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,029
with when Park Cheol-won
moved to field work

386
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:09,490
and when he signed a contract
with Hyekwang Hospital.

387
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:12,535
The one who got Hyekwang Hospital
to sign was Mr. Park,

388
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:15,872
and he's the one
who voluntarily did the field work.

389
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:17,999
You won't let this slide, will you?

390
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:22,461
Why don't we check if there's a connection
between Park Cheol-won and Kim Myeong-jun?

391
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,838
Let's do it.

392
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,599
I don't believe her.

393
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:38,561
I should've remembered something
upon hearing what she said.

394
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:42,440
A part of my memory came back
when I saw the police siren lights.

395
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,650
But that didn't happen this time.

396
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:46,277
I don't remember.

397
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,654
She's lying.

398
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:51,157
Right? She's making stuff up.

399
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,299
Your dad couldn't have done that to you.

400
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:56,037
I'm sure Hye-eun is mistaken.

401
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Right.

402
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,215
Here.

403
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:09,008
What's this?

404
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,595
It was next to you when you collapsed.

405
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,348
This is mine?

406
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:19,435
So? Do you remember anything?

407
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,062
No.

408
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:23,814
Are you sure it's mine?

409
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:25,191
It's so tacky.

410
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:33,824
Don't look at me with those eyes.

411
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:36,327
I'm just going to eat.

412
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,497
It's not like
we can afford to go somewhere.

413
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:43,709
Yes, let's eat all of this and cheer up.

414
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,753
<i>Please take a closer look.</i>

415
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:47,421
<i>There's been minimal progress</i>

416
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:49,149
<i>in the Youngin Kidnapping Case
over the last six days.</i>

417
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:52,051
<i>Yesterday, the police publicized
the suspect, Kim Myeong-jun's face,</i>

418
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:55,513
<i>and disclosed the fact that he has
a record of committing murder.</i>

419
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:57,598
<i>However, his whereabouts
are still unknown.</i>

420
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:00,101
<i>The police revealed
that Kim Myeong-jun, who is suspected</i>

421
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:01,664
<i>to have murdered the child's parents,</i>

422
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:04,855
<i>is currently in Seoul
with the victim, Choi Ro-hee.</i>

423
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:08,067
<i>The golden hour of the case has passed.</i>

424
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:10,236
<i>Looking back at the tracks of the crime,</i>

425
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,798
<i>the police have shared
the current state of investigation...</i>

426
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:13,822
Hey.

427
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,040
My little daughter,
you're done eating, right?

428
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:17,326
Let's go.

429
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:18,536
How much is it?

430
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,705
- It's 10 000 won.
- Okay.

431
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,623
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

432
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,667
Let's go. Come on.

433
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,174
He looks really suspicious, right?

434
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,551
Sorry?

435
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:35,761
He's my dad.

436
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:38,639
Thank you for the food.

437
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:40,182
Sure. Bye.

438
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:47,690
Murder?

439
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,193
You killed someone?

440
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:00,703
It was an accident.

441
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,539
Can you swear...

442
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:08,627
that you didn't murder my mom and dad?

443
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:11,922
Of course.

444
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:14,050
I really didn't.

445
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,016
You have to swear.

446
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:25,978
Fine.

447
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:27,146
I swear

448
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:30,107
I didn't murder your parents.

449
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:31,317
Not that.

450
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:33,444
Then what?

451
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,072
Swear that you won't kill me.

452
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,908
That's a given.

453
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,034
Why would I kill you?

454
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,453
The survival rate
of kidnapped kids is very low.

455
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:47,666
I swear

456
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:50,711
that I won't kill you.

457
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:19,657
Carry it.

458
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:23,369
Let's go.

459
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:43,472
YOON JEONG-DO (HYEKWANG HOSPITAL)

460
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,563
I'm a bit worried.

461
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:52,440
About what? Making the case public?

462
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:54,107
Yes.

463
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:57,778
I'm worried that we might be
provoking the kidnapper.

464
00:28:58,529 --> 00:28:59,864
You might be right.

465
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:01,157
But...

466
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:03,993
this kidnapping case
is completely different

467
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,661
from ordinary ones.

468
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:10,416
The kidnapper came into the ER,
carrying the victim

469
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:11,792
who had an allergic reaction.

470
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,628
And the two called in a false tip
and got on the subway

471
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:16,338
as if they were a team.

472
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:19,800
In this case...

473
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:23,929
it feels like the kid is taking the lead.

474
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:26,932
It's like they're working together.

475
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:28,016
You're right.

476
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:29,226
It's interesting.

477
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:35,149
I can't find anything.

478
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,986
There's no connection between
Park Cheol-won and Kim Myeong-jun.

479
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:41,041
Their movements were completely different.

480
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,828
Anyway, what a strange family.

481
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:49,121
What do you mean?

482
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:53,542
The closest relative to Ro-hee
is her great-uncle,

483
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:55,961
but he's indifferent about the case.

484
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:58,440
He said he didn't receive any calls
from the kidnapper,

485
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,841
and he kept pressuring us
to close the murder case,

486
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:03,636
saying that he needed to hold a funeral
for the deceased.

487
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:08,933
The kidnapped kid...

488
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:12,186
seems rather lonely.

489
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:15,272
CHOI RO-HEE

490
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:22,696
Hey.

491
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:25,824
Do you have...

492
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:28,869
any relatives in the area?

493
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:32,289
I don't even remember my parents' faces,

494
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,220
and you expect me
to remember my relatives?

495
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:41,215
Why are you suddenly asking me that?

496
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:42,526
Are you going to send me to them?

497
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,176
No, I'm just asking.

498
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,434
Are you...

499
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:55,771
not afraid of me?

500
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,567
You said you won't kill me.

501
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:03,179
I have no choice but to trust you.

502
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:11,078
Goodness, I'm sorry.
My kid is still learning.

503
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:14,748
Thanks, kid.

504
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,543
Dad, over here.

505
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:23,549
Dad! I'm bored.
Let's stop sitting around and go play.

506
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,178
Dad, over here.

507
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:30,222
- Dad!
- Here.

508
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:37,271
I'm going to catch it.

509
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:40,858
Blow it to me.

510
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,667
Do all dads play
with their kids like that?

511
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:02,630
Of course.

512
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:06,675
Do you think my dad played with me?

513
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:11,180
Come on! Let me do it!

514
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:17,394
I gave it some thought, and it's not like
we can't trust all the cops, right?

515
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:19,938
And this is Seoul,
so I'm sure we can find a cop we can...

516
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:21,622
Why are you saying that all of a sudden?

517
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,164
Are you really going to turn yourself in?

518
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:28,906
You are, aren't you?

519
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:33,535
We're going nowhere by sticking together.

520
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,913
You think we can lay low forever?

521
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,516
Are you going to sleep from place to place
and eat cup noodles every day?

522
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,042
So you're going to turn yourself in?

523
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:42,252
It's hard for you
to live like this, isn't it?

524
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:45,255
You can cooperate with the police
and catch the culprit,

525
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:47,499
and you can go to the hospital
and recover your memory.

526
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,718
- Stop pretending like you care.
- Ro-hee!

527
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:52,346
You're supposed to help me
if you really care about me!

528
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:53,430
How...

529
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:57,935
How on earth can I help you?

530
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:01,772
Seriously.

531
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:07,111
Turn yourself in if you want.

532
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,155
I'm going to find the culprit alone.

533
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:12,700
Ro-hee!

534
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:20,082
Dad, hurry and throw it back.

535
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,375
Okay.

536
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:30,342
That's new.

537
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,094
Drinking during the day?

538
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:34,972
Is something wrong?

539
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:37,683
No, nothing's wrong.

540
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,227
That's a relief.

541
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:41,895
This is on the house.

542
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:44,383
YOON JEONG-DO (HYEKWANG HOSPITAL)

543
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:46,233
Thank you.

544
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:54,992
Yes, Dr. Yoon.

545
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:57,286
<i>Mr. Park, are you available to talk?</i>

546
00:33:57,453 --> 00:33:59,246
Yes, go ahead.

547
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:03,292
When the police came by earlier today,

548
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:06,211
they asked me about the CCTVs
in Dr. Choi's house.

549
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,214
<i>I told them that you installed
the CCTVs yourself</i>

550
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:11,091
<i>and made the sales yourself too.</i>

551
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:15,888
But looking back, I felt uneasy
about sharing that information.

552
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,265
That's all right.

553
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:20,142
It's the truth.

554
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:22,144
<i>Right? That's a relief.</i>

555
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:23,896
Also,

556
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:27,608
did you look into the thing
that I mentioned last time?

557
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,318
<i>Dr. Choi's mistress.</i>

558
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:30,903
No.

559
00:34:31,153 --> 00:34:34,281
Dr. Choi had all the hard drives.

560
00:34:35,032 --> 00:34:36,033
But Dr. Yoon,

561
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:38,202
by any chance,

562
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:41,038
have you seen

563
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:44,458
his mistress before?

564
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:45,918
Of course.

565
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,961
She used to come by the hospital,

566
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:50,631
so I've seen her a couple of times.

567
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:54,259
It would've been perfect
if there was footage.

568
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:55,886
<i>How disappointing.</i>

569
00:34:56,637 --> 00:34:58,972
<i>Anyway, Mr. Park,
let's have a meal sometime.</i>

570
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:02,267
<i>I'll treat you to a delicious meal
at a nice place.</i>

571
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:04,061
Sure.

572
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:06,063
<i>All right. Goodbye.</i>

573
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:23,497
Goodbye.

574
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:47,604
Goodness, perfect timing.

575
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:51,275
I boiled some meat. Have some.

576
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:54,444
Thank you, ma'am.

577
00:35:55,863 --> 00:35:58,782
You really don't do anything
except work and stay home, do you?

578
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:00,033
Don't you get bored?

579
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:05,706
You should go hiking
with the neighbors next week.

580
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:08,000
It's hard for me to take time off work.

581
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:11,044
Goodness, live a little.

582
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:12,296
And go on dates too.

583
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,883
I'll introduce you to a friend I know.

584
00:36:17,301 --> 00:36:19,553
So join us next time, okay?

585
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:20,971
Okay.

586
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:23,015
I'll join next time.

587
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,474
Gosh, that's great.

588
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:26,226
- Promise, okay?
- Okay.

589
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:28,770
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

590
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:29,730
Sure.

591
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:30,981
Thank you.

592
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,548
- Sir.
- Yes?

593
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:40,884
It's about Park Cheol-won.

594
00:37:41,385 --> 00:37:43,265
He doesn't have connections
with Kim Myeong-jun,

595
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:44,888
but he does with Dr. Choi.

596
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:46,974
What? 1993?

597
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:47,975
Thirty years ago?

598
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:50,143
There was a place called
Masan Hope Medical Center.

599
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:53,146
Dr. Choi's father,
Dr. Choi Dong-eok ran the hospital,

600
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,731
and there was an accident there.

601
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,444
So he lost his wife and his unborn child
due to this accident?

602
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:02,489
It makes sense he'd lose his mind.
He lost the two people he loves.

603
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:05,867
But he took revenge after 30 years?

604
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:08,286
And not even on the perpetrator,
but his son?

605
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,166
I know it's a stretch,

606
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:15,544
but it's enough to make him go mad.

607
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:16,753
It was a serious incident.

608
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:19,589
What? He settled?

609
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:21,943
Yes. He filed a suit against them
for medical malpractice,

610
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,051
but he dropped it.

611
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,053
The hospital
must've paid him appropriately.

612
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:27,347
And no records show that he made
an issue out of it.

613
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:32,394
A case that drove him mad,
but he settled easily.

614
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:35,439
Let's go to Masan.

615
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:36,523
Right now?

616
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:38,829
You want to go
after the case is over then?

617
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:40,527
Hey!

618
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,446
Why aren't you picking up?

619
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:45,115
Don't get me started.
I'm about to go to Masan.

620
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:46,491
- Jeez.
- What is it?

621
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,577
Someone saw Kim Myeong-jun.

622
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,662
- Where?
- Hangang Park.

623
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:53,415
Let's go.

624
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:09,306
- Hey kid, watch where you're going.
- Sorry.

625
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:18,939
Hey!

626
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:21,485
It's dangerous!

627
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:23,320
I'm sorry.

628
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:30,660
How on earth can we catch the culprit?

629
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:32,412
You know I'm dumb.

630
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:35,248
How are we going to keep running away
and avoiding people?

631
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,500
I'm going to do it.

632
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,211
Stop being so stubborn!

633
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:41,004
Look at us.

634
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:43,924
We don't have a clue
where we're going to sleep tonight.

635
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:45,807
We can't even eat
at a restaurant with people.

636
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:48,053
We've been eating at food carts
and convenience stores.

637
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:49,856
So how are we supposed to
catch the culprit?

638
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:56,186
KIDNAPPER, ON THE RUN IN SEOUL

639
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,027
Why does that even matter?

640
00:40:05,112 --> 00:40:07,364
You murdered someone, so what?

641
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:09,116
You're...

642
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:12,160
You're the only one I can trust right now.

643
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:14,438
You're turning yourself in for me?

644
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,883
Don't fool yourself.
It's for your daughter!

645
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,500
You don't even care about me!

646
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:22,879
You haven't cared about me once
since you kidnapped me!

647
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:45,652
Okay.

648
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,071
I'm sorry.

649
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:51,116
I'm sorry for everything, okay?

650
00:40:52,576 --> 00:40:55,829
But I can promise this.

651
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:58,498
I cared about you every single moment

652
00:40:58,874 --> 00:41:01,209
since the day I kidnapped you.

653
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:03,003
Even now, I care.

654
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:06,381
But...

655
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,427
there's nothing I can do for you.

656
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,262
That's why I'm afraid.

657
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:16,099
That I won't be able to protect you.

658
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,854
Just say...

659
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,398
you'll protect me.

660
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:29,279
Okay.

661
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:33,909
I'll protect you no matter what.

662
00:41:34,618 --> 00:41:35,660
I promise.

663
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:45,086
Okay.

664
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:48,006
A man doesn't take back his words.

665
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,424
Let's go now.

666
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,016
HANGANG CONTROL CENTER

667
00:41:58,099 --> 00:41:59,100
It's them.

668
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:00,434
It is.

669
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:05,482
It looks like she's upset at him.

670
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:07,359
I met the witness.

671
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,862
He didn't think it was them
because the girl spoke Japanese.

672
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:12,489
- What?
- Japanese?

673
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:14,824
She tricked him?

674
00:42:15,242 --> 00:42:16,326
I know, right?

675
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:19,179
Which direction does that way take you?

676
00:42:19,246 --> 00:42:20,997
- Is there an exit?
- Yes.

677
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:24,376
If you keep going that way,
it'll take you to Mapo-daero.

678
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:26,064
Get the CCTV footage from Mapo-daero.

679
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:27,127
Okay.

680
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:13,300
This is the CCTV footage
we got from Mapo Police Station.

681
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:14,384
Right.

682
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:17,178
What? She's in complete control of him.

683
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:19,639
- Where is this?
- Around this area.

684
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:21,613
We're in contact with the situation room.

685
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:24,686
Park Sang-yun.

686
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,023
It's been a while.

687
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:32,861
I'm busy.

688
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:34,821
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

689
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:38,074
Come on, don't give me the cold shoulder
when it's been so long.

690
00:43:38,325 --> 00:43:40,493
We're here as backups to support you.

691
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:44,230
You haven't been to Seoul in a while,
so you might get lost.

692
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:45,874
We don't need backup.

693
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:49,096
I don't need the help of someone
who doesn't know how to do his job.

694
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:50,253
Me?

695
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:51,379
Get moving!

696
00:43:51,463 --> 00:43:52,463
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

697
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:55,383
That bastard is still bratty.

698
00:43:56,593 --> 00:43:57,677
Let's search for him too.

699
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:10,065
Should we sleep at a sauna today?

700
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:13,051
There'd be too many people, right?

701
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:14,194
Scratch that.

702
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:16,446
People would recognize us
if we went to a motel.

703
00:44:16,613 --> 00:44:18,448
Should I look for an inn?

704
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:20,867
Actually, too many people
would be there, right?

705
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:22,827
- Then where do we sleep?
- Listen.

706
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:26,289
I've given it some thought,

707
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,559
and I'll be the only one
who will think from now on.

708
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:32,253
- Why?
- Just stop thinking altogether.

709
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:35,006
You don't even think
about the fact that we're wanted.

710
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:37,008
Then where do we sleep?

711
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:39,134
There.

712
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,388
WHITE MOTEL

713
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:44,057
A motel? How do you expect to go in there?

714
00:44:44,391 --> 00:44:45,517
Right.

715
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,812
They might get suspicious
if we both go in, so go in first.

716
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:51,731
If the owner is watching the news,
just come back out.

717
00:44:51,815 --> 00:44:54,150
If they're watching a show,
ask them if they have a room.

718
00:44:55,360 --> 00:45:00,198
If you call me out from that window,
I'll sneak up, okay?

719
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:02,491
Jeez.

720
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:03,952
You're really...

721
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:06,329
a genius.

722
00:45:06,746 --> 00:45:08,498
Okay, I'll go in first.

723
00:45:08,832 --> 00:45:10,291
Wait in front of this flower shop.

724
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:13,128
- Leave the bag.
- Why?

725
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:14,671
They might get suspicious.

726
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:17,173
You're so smart.

727
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:18,758
Okay. Here.

728
00:45:19,968 --> 00:45:20,969
Wait here.

729
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:31,771
FLOWER SHOP

730
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,194
<i>Is that Haengun Noodles?</i>

731
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:43,408
Excuse me, I'd like a room.

732
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:44,868
It's 30 000 won.

733
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:47,704
Right.

734
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:49,663
Here.

735
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:19,569
<i>People feel better
when they look at flowers.</i>

736
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:25,158
Here.

737
00:46:25,909 --> 00:46:27,327
This is your flower, Ro-hee.

738
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:35,793
How do you feel?

739
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,756
Why do you feel better
when you look at flowers?

740
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,509
What kind of effect does it have?

741
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:45,220
It's in its nature.

742
00:46:46,054 --> 00:46:49,224
Flowers are just like that.

743
00:46:50,183 --> 00:46:52,227
Don't try to interpret everything
based on logic.

744
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:55,146
Try to feel it with your heart.

745
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:02,487
<i>Feelings...</i>

746
00:47:03,196 --> 00:47:04,739
<i>aren't facts, Mom.</i>

747
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:09,994
Mom...

748
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:37,522
What? Where did she go?

749
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:50,826
Ro-hee.

750
00:47:52,662 --> 00:47:53,662
Ro-hee.

751
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:55,789
Ro-hee.

752
00:48:00,837 --> 00:48:01,837
Ro-hee!

753
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:04,215
Ro-hee!

754
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:07,051
Kim Myeong-jun, stop right there!
This is the police.

755
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,595
We're the police. Stop.

756
00:48:08,845 --> 00:48:11,055
- Mr. Kim, we're the police.
- Wait...

757
00:48:11,139 --> 00:48:12,473
I get it.

758
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:14,142
- Hold on.
- Okay.

759
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:19,856
- Okay.
- Hold on.

760
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:22,191
- All right.
- Damn it!

761
00:48:28,281 --> 00:48:29,866
I'm sorry.

762
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:31,784
I'm sorry!

763
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,038
Kim Myeong-jun!

764
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:39,876
Stop right there.

765
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:41,001
Damn it.

766
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:46,341
I'm sorry.

767
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:48,551
- I'm sorry!
- Kim Myeong-jun!

768
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,970
- Chang-hun! You two, get the car!
- Okay. Ju-hyeok!

769
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,645
Damn it, seriously.

770
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:05,276
Hey, you bastard!

771
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:10,782
Hey!

772
00:49:20,917 --> 00:49:22,001
You bastard!

773
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:23,586
Hey!

774
00:49:35,223 --> 00:49:36,641
Wait, over here.

775
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:38,969
- Get in the car behind.
- Okay.

776
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:43,397
Get in.

777
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:09,757
Hey!

778
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:21,644
Who's in the car in the front
that he's chasing it so fast?

779
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:23,730
We'll catch him and ask.

780
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:25,064
- Yes, sir.
<i>- Sir.</i>

781
00:50:25,148 --> 00:50:28,484
We've requested backup and asked them
to mobilize all the patrol vehicles.

782
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:29,776
Roger.

783
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:31,988
Stop!

784
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:54,552
Hey, you bastard!

785
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:56,840
Damn it.

786
00:53:26,746 --> 00:53:27,788
You bastard.

787
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:29,248
You're dead.

788
00:53:47,016 --> 00:53:49,727
Mr. Kim Myeong-jun. Please just go.

789
00:53:49,852 --> 00:53:50,853
What?

790
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:52,563
How do you know my name?

791
00:53:53,189 --> 00:53:54,732
Who are you?

792
00:53:55,483 --> 00:53:56,525
Not talking?

793
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,444
Fine.

794
00:53:58,527 --> 00:53:59,737
I'll make you talk.

795
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:17,004
Does your hand hurt?
Serves you right, you bastard.

796
00:54:18,214 --> 00:54:19,298
Gosh, it hurts.

797
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:21,717
I'm bleeding! Damn it.

798
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:24,387
We'll be taking Choi Ro-hee.

799
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:26,055
What?

800
00:54:26,138 --> 00:54:27,932
Who are you to take Ro-hee?!

801
00:54:28,224 --> 00:54:29,517
Who are you?

802
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:33,479
Whatever. Let me just tell you one thing.

803
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:36,148
I made a promise with Ro-hee today

804
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:37,525
that I'd protect her.

805
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:41,237
Not even a day has passed
since I promised her, you bastard!

806
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:57,753
I told you, didn't I?

807
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,263
You bastard.

808
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:22,069
Mr. Kim Myeong-jun.

809
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:26,490
Please stop and go on your way
before you hurt yourself even more.

810
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:30,244
You really don't understand, do you?

811
00:55:31,871 --> 00:55:33,539
I told you.

812
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:37,918
I'm the one who protects that child!

813
00:55:38,294 --> 00:55:39,211
Damn it.

814
00:55:39,295 --> 00:55:40,880
I really can't get through you, can I?

815
00:55:50,056 --> 00:55:51,891
You know what my nickname is?

816
00:55:58,814 --> 00:56:00,733
It's Monster, you bastard.

817
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:23,464
Ro-hee.

818
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:25,925
Ro-hee.

819
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:29,553
Ro-hee.

820
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:34,350
I'm sorry.

821
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,060
Let's go.

822
00:56:39,939 --> 00:56:43,059
You should've captured him if you went
all the way to Seoul and caused a scene!

823
00:56:43,943 --> 00:56:46,862
What you did today is all over the news!

824
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:48,781
And you lost the kidnapper?

825
00:56:49,782 --> 00:56:51,325
How humiliating is this?

826
00:56:52,535 --> 00:56:55,079
I can only stand up for you so much.

827
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:57,933
We'll talk again after I come back
from the headquarters tomorrow

828
00:56:57,957 --> 00:56:59,166
about your punishments!

829
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:04,296
- I'm sorry, sir.
- I'm sorry, sir.

830
00:57:04,547 --> 00:57:05,923
Good going, guys.

831
00:57:08,217 --> 00:57:09,260
Chief.

832
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:15,891
Are you okay?

833
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:18,810
Yes.

834
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:23,481
Where are you going?

835
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:25,067
Rooftop.

836
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:44,170
Ro-hee.

837
00:57:47,256 --> 00:57:48,924
Wake up.

838
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:52,761
Please.

839
00:57:57,308 --> 00:57:58,350
Let's...

840
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:00,895
Let's rest for a bit.

841
00:58:43,604 --> 00:58:44,730
Ro-hee.

842
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:49,193
I'm sorry.

843
00:58:50,486 --> 00:58:51,654
I'm...

844
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:55,491
sorry.

845
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:51,380
<i>Where's the man who was with me?</i>

846
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:52,881
<i>What are you doing to Ro-hee?</i>

847
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,693
Were you the one
who was trying to hurt her?

848
00:59:54,717 --> 00:59:56,176
<i>You want to me hand over the case?</i>

849
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,637
This isn't an ordinary kidnapping case.

850
00:59:58,887 --> 01:00:02,516
<i>Ro-hee is a genius child
who's in the top 0.01 percentile.</i>

851
01:00:02,683 --> 01:00:04,476
<i>You will be the hope of humankind.</i>

852
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:07,227
<i>If I become worthless
as a subject of the research,</i>

853
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:09,273
<i>I'll be worthless to her.</i>

854
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:11,396
<i>How is it? It's nice to see
the sea up close, right?</i>

855
01:00:11,442 --> 01:00:13,694
<i>It's my first time touching the sea.</i>

856
01:00:13,902 --> 01:00:15,863
We should separate them
as soon as possible.

857
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:17,156
<i>Let's get out of here.</i>

858
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:18,407
<i>How are you going to escape?</i>

859
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:20,492
Ro-hee is the product of our investment!

860
01:00:20,576 --> 01:00:22,369
<i>We must protect her at all costs.</i>

861
01:00:22,453 --> 01:00:25,080
<i>The moment you leave this place,
you'll fall in danger.</i>

862
01:00:25,164 --> 01:00:27,082
<i>We have to find people who will help us.</i>
