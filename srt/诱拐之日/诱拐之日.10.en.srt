1
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,604
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS, GROUPS,

2
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,856
AND SETTINGS ARE FICTITIOUS,
AND CHILD SAFETY GUIDELINES WERE FOLLOWED

3
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:16,911
Ms. Choi Hye-eun?

4
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,623
I guess I had your last name wrong.

5
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:24,877
Seo Hye-eun doesn't know
who her father is,

6
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:27,421
but Choi Hye-eun does.

7
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,882
She knows the father who abandoned her.

8
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,844
So the kidnapping was to get your revenge.

9
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:36,222
I heard the subjects

10
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:38,849
of Choi Dong-eok's research
started with orphans.

11
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,228
How much do you know?

12
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:45,731
I know that you're the mastermind
behind the kidnapping case.

13
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:48,234
The girl had a big mouth.

14
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:50,569
Anyway,

15
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,865
what's the reason you stopped my car
out of nowhere?

16
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:58,327
I apologize for that.
You just seemed to be in a hurry.

17
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:03,374
As far as I know,
you're Dr. Choi's business partner,

18
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:07,503
but I was wondering if you were
missing out on something important.

19
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,797
I think I have to ask you
the same question.

20
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,008
How much do you know?

21
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:26,939
I was always curious because I couldn't
install CCTV in the lab,

22
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:29,275
but he recorded a video
to document his research.

23
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,823
Was this inside the empty safe?

24
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:37,658
That's a secret.

25
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:40,828
How interesting.

26
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:43,664
I was curious as well.

27
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,667
The kidnapping and the murder
happened in the same time frame,

28
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,795
so I wondered what the connection
between these two cases was.

29
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,340
You must be close to the murder suspect.

30
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:57,219
That curiosity has nothing to do
with you earning money.

31
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:00,598
That's true.

32
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:04,894
But I was put in a difficult spot
thanks to my partner's death.

33
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:07,146
That must be why
you were going to that empty house,

34
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,647
hoping to find something useful.

35
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:09,982
I see you also tailed me.

36
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,735
I thought tailing you
would make me some money.

37
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,487
I guess I need to hear more of your story.

38
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,823
How did you get to know me?

39
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:22,369
I was monitoring Dr. Choi's house

40
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,997
and discovered that he had
an interesting guest come over.

41
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,919
All the guests that visit him

42
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,421
are subjects of my interest.

43
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,216
For a long time,

44
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,886
X Capital invested in companies
with potential.

45
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:40,596
However,

46
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,514
this isn't about potential.
It's about changing--

47
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,226
X CAPITAL NAMED ONE OF SINGAPORE'S
TOP 5 INVESTMENT COMPANIES

48
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,604
You do more than what's on your website.

49
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:49,772
I see you also did a background check.

50
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:52,274
You have to be diligent to make money.

51
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,905
I'm sure you aren't here to sell me
the videos that you diligently collected.

52
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:01,700
Before Mr. Park Cheol-won was arrested,

53
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,411
he sent me the last hard drive.

54
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,341
Dr. Choi's wife

55
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:20,010
brought Ro-hee's pendant

56
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:22,846
and opened it with a small key.

57
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:25,641
What are you doing?

58
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:29,478
Do you even know what this is?

59
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:32,064
How dare you touch Ro-hee's records?
Are you crazy?!

60
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,108
I'm trying to leave a real record.

61
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,526
I confirmed two things.

62
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:38,320
First, that pendant and the key

63
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:40,322
aren't what they seem.

64
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:43,784
Second, the reason So Jin-yu had to die.

65
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:45,035
So?

66
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:48,580
Dr. Choi's research materials
are in that pendant?

67
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:55,546
Strangely charming.

68
00:04:57,006 --> 00:04:59,216
What about the key? Do you have it?

69
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,927
Wouldn't that make sense
for us to reach a deal?

70
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:04,054
I can't trust you.

71
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:06,140
You can decide whether or not to trust me

72
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,684
after you open the pendant with the key.

73
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:11,895
No risk, no magic.

74
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:13,897
If you want magic, you need to risk it.

75
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,065
Life is about gambling.

76
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:20,279
What are the conditions?

77
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,825
Today at 3:00 p.m., on the third floor
of the parking lot in Yeouido Mart,

78
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:29,371
there will be a black sedan
with the number 1652 next to Column 15.

79
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,249
Put ten million dollars in cash

80
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:37,379
in the trunk of that car
and give me a call.

81
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:40,966
I don't have to repeat
the plate number, right?

82
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:58,192
CHAPTER 10. COUNTERATTACK

83
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:00,861
BASED ON THE NOVEL
THE DAY OF KIDNAPPING BY JEONG HAE-YEON

84
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,743
It is a flash drive.

85
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:09,953
Can you open it?

86
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:12,247
No.

87
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:13,707
It's been custom-made,

88
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,960
meaning that it can only be opened
with a specific key.

89
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,379
So if you try to open it
with something else,

90
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,590
all the data inside will be damaged.

91
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,010
Do you absolutely need the key?
Is there no other way?

92
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,472
Didn't I just say

93
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,682
that there's no other way?

94
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,686
Do you always talk so rudely?

95
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,605
Or are you a foreigner?

96
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:38,649
What an odd man you are.

97
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,608
Jeez.

98
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:40,901
What?

99
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,361
Dollars?

100
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,279
So you are a foreigner.

101
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,156
Come back next…

102
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:48,033
See you later!

103
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:52,955
Score.

104
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,730
No risk, no magic.

105
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,696
If you want magic, you need to risk it.

106
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,030
Life is about gambling.

107
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,367
Seo Hye-eun.

108
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:35,539
Hye-eun.

109
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,375
Don't you have anything else to say to me?

110
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,255
Hold on.

111
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,591
Just let the meeting finish.

112
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,426
I'll take responsibility.

113
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,262
I heard you're on suspension.

114
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,265
Sorry?

115
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,142
-Stop the meeting now.
-Yes, sir.

116
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:56,560
Excuse me.

117
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,926
We're late. Eat quickly.

118
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,143
OUTBOUND VESSEL ENTRANCE PERMIT

119
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,561
Choi Ro…

120
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,317
Choi Ro-hee!

121
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:49,566
Damn it.

122
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,906
Damn it.

123
00:10:58,408 --> 00:10:59,326
Kim Myeong-jun!

124
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,494
What?

125
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:08,502
Damn it!

126
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:33,902
Damn it.

127
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,531
Mr. Kim Myeong-jun.

128
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:40,617
Nothing good will come

129
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:43,745
from running away every single time.

130
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,580
Where's the kid?

131
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:49,960
I said where's the kid?

132
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,795
I'm here to look for her too!

133
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,966
What do you mean?

134
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:00,303
Why were you at Dr. Mo's hospital?

135
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,932
I know what Choi Ro-hee has gone through.

136
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,477
Don't try to lie to me.

137
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:11,565
They took Ro-hee.

138
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,235
We were going
to the hospital to see Hee-ae

139
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,946
and to end everything there.

140
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,699
But those guys took Ro-hee.

141
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,618
And they also tried to kill Dr. Mo.

142
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,163
But Dr. Mo

143
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,249
found this location

144
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:30,834
in one of the men's phones

145
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:32,961
and that they're going
to leave Korea soon.

146
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,923
This is everything I know.

147
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:38,467
Are you…

148
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,344
referring to the people
who had Ro-hee's ransom?

149
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:43,763
Yes, I am.

150
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,853
CAPTAIN

151
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,817
By the way, who tailed Ju-hyeok?

152
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,986
I think our captain looked into it.

153
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:04,951
-Let's look for her.
-Sorry?

154
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:09,122
Hurry up and get moving.
We don't have time.

155
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:14,878
Hurry!

156
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:22,093
-Hello.
-Hello.

157
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,180
Can we see the record of the permits
that went through today?

158
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:26,223
Ro-hee!

159
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,436
Ro-hee!

160
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:33,647
Choi Ro-hee.

161
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:35,440
Where are you, Choi Ro-hee?

162
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:42,280
Ro-hee!

163
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:46,493
Choi Ro-hee!

164
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,169
DETECTIVE PARK SANG-YUN

165
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:17,983
Hello, sir.

166
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,317
Call the Maritime Affairs Office

167
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:22,988
and ask if they permitted
any personal yachts in today.

168
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,115
Personal yachts? Why?

169
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,325
If we don't find Choi Ro-hee,
we'll lose her forever.

170
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:29,035
Look into it as soon as possible.

171
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:31,955
Answer me!

172
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:33,915
Park Sang-yun.

173
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:37,210
I can overlook you taking the wiretapper

174
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,046
through Ju-hyeok.

175
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:41,506
But you're on suspension.

176
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,634
Don't you know what will happen
if you keep this up?

177
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:46,469
Where are you?

178
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:48,680
Why are you acting on your own again?

179
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:50,515
Hey.

180
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:51,850
Park Sang-yun!

181
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:53,935
Sir.

182
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,480
Dr. Choi had another investor.

183
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,734
He's trying to smuggle Choi Ro-hee
out of the country.

184
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,612
We may not be able to find her again.

185
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,365
I really want to close the case
that I started.

186
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:10,285
So you're going to stir up trouble?

187
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:14,539
Who can I trust if I can't trust my team
in this situation?

188
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,374
What do you mean by that?

189
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,294
Please help me out once.

190
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,088
Please, sir.

191
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,677
What did he say?

192
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,199
Did you bring the documents
to receive them on his behalf?

193
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:50,450
Yes.

194
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,913
PARK CHEOL-WON

195
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,915
Oh, and my ID.

196
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,751
CONTENT: ELECTRONIC DEVICE

197
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:12,305
Here you go.

198
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:13,515
Thank you.

199
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,063
I'd like all the money in cash, please.

200
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:21,648
Yes, ma'am.

201
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:28,113
SANGNAMJA PRIVATE AGENCY

202
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:29,698
-Hello!
-Welcome!

203
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:35,829
It's you, right? It's been a while!

204
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,872
I hope you're using the phone
and the car well.

205
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:43,461
Do me another job.

206
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:19,873
I don't see her. What about that side?

207
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:20,999
Nothing.

208
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:30,633
Yes, sir.

209
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:34,721
There's a yacht
that came in from Russia at the dock.

210
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,766
It came in not long ago,
and it'll leave in two hours.

211
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,518
Thank you, sir.

212
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:44,981
I'll call Sokcho Police Station,

213
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:46,775
so you get out of there now.

214
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:50,820
If this goes wrong,
you won't get your badge back.

215
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,741
I have to be here. Things got complicated.

216
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:59,954
Are you with someone right now?

217
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,920
No, sir. I'm alone.

218
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,051
Yes?

219
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,432
I received a call from the HQ.

220
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:20,642
Here.

221
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:22,185
Thank you.

222
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,771
We'll escort you to your destination.

223
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:25,897
No need.

224
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:54,133
-What?
-Hold on.

225
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:55,760
I think it's that one.

226
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:57,345
The one in the middle.

227
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,349
What is it?

228
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,309
Don't you know what situation you're in?

229
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:05,603
Don't get ahead of yourself.
I'll take care of this.

230
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:07,272
But still…

231
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:10,066
I'm saying you shouldn't do anything
that will put you in danger.

232
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:11,860
Okay.

233
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,738
Right, do you know his name?

234
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,991
The guy who's trying to take Ro-hee.

235
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,409
Oh, well…

236
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,662
It was J…

237
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,247
J?

238
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:27,375
Jay-Z?

239
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:29,460
Jay-Z.

240
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,007
Jay-Z?

241
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:37,802
Okay.

242
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,054
Okay.

243
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,307
I'll see you soon. Bye.

244
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:11,169
Detective! It's Jaden!

245
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,546
Who the hell are you guys?

246
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,924
It's illegal to possess guns in Korea.

247
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:44,035
-Yes?
-What the hell are you doing?!

248
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:45,745
The hospital?

249
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,622
She had difficulty breathing
and collapsed.

250
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:48,998
She's recovering.

251
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:51,876
Don't you know
what state she's supposed to be in?

252
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,129
It won't be late
even if we go after she recovers.

253
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:57,090
What if people recognize her?

254
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,633
I'll make sure that doesn't happen.

255
00:20:58,883 --> 00:20:59,801
You…

256
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,188
I heard you haven't registered yet.
Could you fill out the forms?

257
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,023
Sure.

258
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,027
She's stable now, so don't worry.

259
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,641
DISPOSABLE SYRINGE

260
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:50,101
MORPHINE 10ML

261
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:27,346
He said he took her to the hospital.

262
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:30,475
Her face was on the news,
so it won't be easy for him to admit her.

263
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,810
Check all the suspicious patients.

264
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,937
Thanks.

265
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,027
Are you okay?

266
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,699
I can't believe I'm consoling a kidnapper.

267
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:50,536
If she's at the hospital

268
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,122
because those guys hurt her,

269
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,334
I won't let it slide.

270
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,672
Get a hold of your emotions and hop in.

271
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:02,673
Let's move.

272
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:22,401
What are you doing?

273
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:56,394
Who are you?

274
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:00,690
Show me the parking lot CCTV.

275
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:25,715
Damn it.

276
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,344
358O 1652

277
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,096
There it is.

278
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:02,877
You're on time.

279
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:05,755
-What about the key?
-Did you put the money in?

280
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,089
Where's the damn key?!

281
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:08,966
Gosh, you're scary.

282
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,177
You almost made me cry.

283
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:14,805
You can only take the money
if you keep your end of the deal.

284
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:16,933
That's why I'm checking the money first.

285
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:25,858
I guess you weren't all talk.

286
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,655
Since you played nice,

287
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,074
let me give you something extra.

288
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:35,493
Ta-da.

289
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,997
It's Choi Jin-tae's video recording
we saw earlier together.

290
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:43,542
What about the key?

291
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:48,130
And here comes the key…

292
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:50,591
to Choi Ro-hee's pendant.

293
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:56,389
Wait.

294
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:00,059
I need to confirm what you said is true.

295
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:04,772
Our deal was for me to give you the key.

296
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,484
It's only right
to validate the value of the items.

297
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:10,861
Follow me.

298
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:49,650
Happy?

299
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,278
Where do you think you're going?

300
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,364
-Let me go.
-I have to check the content.

301
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:56,532
What's wrong with you?

302
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,659
You think it'd be easy
to make ten million dollars?

303
00:26:58,743 --> 00:27:00,244
You think I'm having it easy right now?

304
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:02,788
-Come here.
-Let me go!

305
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:05,207
Let go!

306
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,001
A fire has broken out.

307
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,880
What's going on? Go check it out.

308
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,893
-Let go!
-Come here!

309
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:28,773
Damn it.

310
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:31,609
-Help me!
-Come already!

311
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:33,069
I think a fire broke out.

312
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:34,278
What?

313
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,789
Hey, the car!

314
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:46,957
Stop the car first!

315
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,209
Damn it!

316
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,002
What's going on?

317
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:52,421
Stop the car with the number 1652!

318
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:53,631
Roger.

319
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:54,673
Damn it!

320
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:13,984
Stop.

321
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,240
Get out!

322
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:26,622
25G 7904

323
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:27,790
Hurry up!

324
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:34,547
Go!

325
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,013
My gosh, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

326
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:44,098
Damn it!

327
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:53,107
Get out!

328
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:56,777
Open the door!

329
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:16,964
Who told you to do this?

330
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:18,507
Answer me!

331
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,970
A trespass has been reported

332
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:25,848
regarding a strange man barging into
the security room and checking the CCTV.

333
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,808
We checked the CCTV footage,

334
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,059
and it's that bastard.

335
00:29:29,143 --> 00:29:30,644
The bastard we arrested before.

336
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:32,980
That rude and arrogant bastard.

337
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:41,405
What about Choi Ro-hee?

338
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:43,365
While he was at the reception,

339
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:45,993
she snuck out and hopped into a truck.

340
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,537
It's a truck
that disposes of medical supplies,

341
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:50,331
and it's headed to the disposal site.

342
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:52,958
-Text me the address.
-Yes, sir.

343
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:07,264
MEDICAL SUPPLY DISPOSAL CONTAINER

344
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:12,997
Ro-hee!

345
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:16,375
Ro-hee!

346
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:25,467
Ro-hee!

347
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,103
Choi Ro-hee!

348
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:39,982
Doing this helps no one!

349
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:41,942
You asked me…

350
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:44,653
how you could prevent

351
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,364
people from falling into more danger.

352
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,285
If you keep this up,
everyone will end up getting hurt.

353
00:31:53,454 --> 00:31:55,247
The only way to keep everyone safe

354
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:57,916
is for both of us to disappear.

355
00:32:02,463 --> 00:32:03,422
Choi Ro-hee!

356
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:06,675
Stop wasting energy and come out.

357
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:07,760
Ro-hee!

358
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:09,011
Don't listen to him!

359
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:10,304
Don't come out!

360
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:14,016
Don't come out!

361
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:17,561
Don't come out until I tell you so, okay?

362
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:21,315
And if someone ends up getting hurt here,

363
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:22,650
it's not your fault.

364
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,110
Got it?

365
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:26,820
And you!

366
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:28,822
The guy who's never
been in a relationship!

367
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,325
I'm warning you!

368
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,744
If you're going to take Ro-hee,

369
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:36,246
you'll have to kill me first!

370
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:38,540
Because I'll protect her no matter what!

371
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:41,460
I won't let you go anywhere.

372
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:53,555
You owe me something, don't you?

373
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:02,773
My goodness!

374
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,069
You scared me!

375
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,530
Are you okay?

376
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:12,491
-What's this needle?
-How did you come here? With whom?

377
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:14,952
A cop.

378
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:15,911
A cop?

379
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,205
What were you thinking,
coming here with a cop?

380
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:19,498
Let's go.

381
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:21,417
No.

382
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:16,013
It seems like you can't
weasel your way out this time.

383
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,155
Did you lose him?

384
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,366
Yes, but I almost had him.

385
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:22,621
Let's go to the station.

386
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:24,790
-Darn it.
-What?

387
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:27,334
-Excuse me, Detective.
-What?

388
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,628
-What's this?
-I'm sorry.

389
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:31,046
What are you doing?

390
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:33,006
What?

391
00:35:34,383 --> 00:35:35,217
Mr. Kim…

392
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,471
What's this?

393
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:42,933
What are you…

394
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:44,935
What…

395
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:47,396
What are you…

396
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,150
Damn it.

397
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:56,697
Open the door.

398
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:13,964
What the…

399
00:36:17,718 --> 00:36:19,303
For goodness' sake.

400
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,055
Are you kidding me?

401
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:27,936
Mr. Kim, what are you doing right now?

402
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:29,855
I'm so sorry.

403
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:34,067
I signed a contract with Ro-hee,

404
00:36:35,152 --> 00:36:36,653
and it hasn't expired yet.

405
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:37,696
I'm so sorry.

406
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:40,574
Let us properly introduce ourselves.

407
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:43,118
I'm Choi Ro-hee, the kidnapped child.

408
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:45,329
And he's my kidnapper.

409
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:47,122
What are you doing?
You're embarrassing me.

410
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,165
Introduce yourself.

411
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:51,335
I'm Kim Myeong-jun.

412
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:55,047
I know who you are,

413
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:56,715
so untie me.

414
00:36:56,924 --> 00:36:58,717
Promise me something before that.

415
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:00,969
-What is it?
-Promise me…

416
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:03,931
that you won't arrest him.

417
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:07,309
This is a kidnapping case.
It's a serious crime.

418
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:09,019
Didn't you see the cops flood in?

419
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,814
I can't decide on my own
whether or not to arrest him.

420
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,900
I'm not saying
you shouldn't arrest him forever.

421
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:16,818
Just until this is over.

422
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,196
Let him go until then.

423
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:21,114
I need to find him an attorney,

424
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:24,993
and when everything's prepared,
he'll turn himself in.

425
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:26,870
Right?

426
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:28,664
Of course I will.

427
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:30,457
This is ridiculous.

428
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:35,087
Well, I'm not a cop right now anyway.

429
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,756
What? You're not a cop?

430
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,216
What?

431
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:41,635
He is a cop. I saw him in action.

432
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:43,845
I see. You got fired.

433
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:47,307
It's no wonder.
You're not good at your job.

434
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:50,143
You had it coming,
considering you couldn't even

435
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:51,353
catch this clumsy culprit.

436
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:52,896
I'm not clumsy.

437
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:54,356
I'm under punishment.

438
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,358
-You are?
-Yes.

439
00:37:56,692 --> 00:37:59,152
Reduction of salary? On probation?

440
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:00,362
Suspension.

441
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:02,406
I see. That's great.

442
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:04,449
You can't arrest him,

443
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:06,827
and you'll come in handy
since you're an ex-cop.

444
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:09,371
I'm not an ex-cop. I'm on…

445
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,626
Actually, I don't think
you'll be much of a help.

446
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:16,753
You look pretty incompetent.

447
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:19,589
Come on, that's not true.
He's really smart.

448
00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:22,592
It's just that we're just smarter.

449
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:25,721
"We"?

450
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:29,850
Why do you keep
mooching off my intelligence?

451
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:33,353
Don't be so cheap. We're a team.

452
00:38:33,437 --> 00:38:34,479
Untie me!

453
00:38:35,022 --> 00:38:37,858
Promise me first, then I will.

454
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,166
All right, in order to make a passport,

455
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:55,542
process the photo,

456
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:57,919
and check if it functions well,

457
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:02,299
we'll need at least seven days.

458
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:03,925
That's way too long.

459
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:06,511
Come on, don't be like that.

460
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:10,807
We're the fastest in the country.
We're not slow.

461
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:14,269
You saw how fast we were earlier
and how good we were at improvising.

462
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:15,729
How disappointing.

463
00:39:25,072 --> 00:39:25,947
Six days and a half.

464
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:28,700
I'm flying out in the morning in a week.

465
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:33,205
If you really need it that fast,

466
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:37,417
we'll work our butts off.

467
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,633
Goodbye, ma'am!

468
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:05,904
SANGNAMJA PRIVATE AGENCY

469
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:07,531
Who are you?

470
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:09,825
Where's that bitch?!

471
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,701
Who are you talking about?

472
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:17,124
Oh, that lady
from the supermarket parking lot?

473
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:21,419
But you see, I can't disclose
our client's information.

474
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:22,587
We can't risk…

475
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:26,466
I mean, it's how we make a living.

476
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:34,724
Hey, you.

477
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:36,977
Do you know her?

478
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,979
Sorry?

479
00:40:43,108 --> 00:40:44,192
Damn it.

480
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,917
Flying out of the country?

481
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:05,172
With my money?

482
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:28,820
I could've gone to get the car.

483
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:32,282
How can I trust you and send you alone?

484
00:41:34,743 --> 00:41:36,036
I won't run away.

485
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:47,464
This feels strange.

486
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:49,633
I've always been curious about you two.

487
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:52,469
Where you are and what you're up to.

488
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:56,973
It's fascinating
as if I'm with celebrities.

489
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:00,727
About Ro-hee…

490
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:04,481
About what you found out about her.

491
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:08,235
What will you do?

492
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:14,574
I'm torn on how I should
take care of this.

493
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,536
This is big news
that'll turn the world upside down,

494
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,374
but it may not be good for her.

495
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:30,257
What about you?

496
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:32,092
How do you want this to all end?

497
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:37,806
I just…

498
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:41,142
want her to be happy.

499
00:42:47,524 --> 00:42:50,527
I'm aware of the crime I committed.

500
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:54,155
And I know how shameful it is of me

501
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:56,616
to say these things.

502
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:00,829
But that's why I'm doing all this.

503
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,415
I want to set everything back.

504
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:07,252
Ro-hee is still a kid.

505
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:12,007
And on top of that,
she must have gone through a lot.

506
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:16,970
I'm going to help her

507
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:20,390
live in a better environment

508
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:23,476
and a happier life than before.

509
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:25,645
After that,

510
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:28,356
I'll pay for what I did.

511
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:32,569
The world may not agree with your ideals.

512
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,155
After all, a crime is a crime.

513
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:40,702
About Ro-hee's memories…

514
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:44,914
What if her memories come back,

515
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:48,335
and they point to Ms. Seo Hye-eun?

516
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,213
What will you do then?

517
00:43:56,468 --> 00:43:57,510
Then…

518
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:01,681
I'll follow Ro-hee's decision.

519
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:07,645
This way, please.

520
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:11,566
No way.

521
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:19,032
-Enjoy your night.
-Hold on.

522
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:32,087
-Thank you.
-Thank you, ma'am.

523
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:42,389
INCOMING CALL

524
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:45,809
Hello?

525
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:47,394
Is this Hee-ae's mother?

526
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,521
Hee-ae is awake.

527
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:51,523
-Sorry?
-Let me put her on the phone.

528
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:55,235
Mom?

529
00:44:58,029 --> 00:44:59,697
Is that you, Mom?

530
00:45:06,162 --> 00:45:07,664
She's not talking.

531
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:09,374
Really?

532
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,127
She hung up. Give me a second.

533
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:13,878
Where's Dad?

534
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:17,465
He said he'd be back with a present

535
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:20,260
after my surgery.

536
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:23,972
Where's my dad?

537
00:45:57,422 --> 00:46:00,717
Do you know
what Dr. Mo Eun-sun's husband does?

538
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:02,552
Yes, sir.

539
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:04,554
He's Judge Kim Cheol-gi.

540
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:07,515
And you want a search warrant
for his house?

541
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:11,352
The circumstances are clear.

542
00:46:12,312 --> 00:46:15,690
Kim Myeong-jun was hiding
at Dr. Mo's hospital yesterday,

543
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:19,068
and a man whose hands and feet were tied
was found there.

544
00:46:19,152 --> 00:46:20,320
Isn't that kidnapping case…

545
00:46:21,196 --> 00:46:22,906
not our case anymore?

546
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:25,325
You're not acting like yourself.

547
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:29,829
Calm down and let's go eat.

548
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:34,083
Chief.

549
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:37,462
What do you mean…

550
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:40,465
by not acting like myself?

551
00:46:41,341 --> 00:46:42,258
What?

552
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:48,181
Sang-yun…

553
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,100
is investigating the case off the record.

554
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:54,354
And I'm the one
who cornered him into doing that.

555
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:56,439
And…

556
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:59,192
the one who ordered me to corner him

557
00:46:59,901 --> 00:47:00,860
is you.

558
00:47:00,944 --> 00:47:03,404
You bastard. Have you lost your mind?!

559
00:47:04,197 --> 00:47:05,532
When did I order such a thing?

560
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:08,576
Why are you blaming me
when you're the one who caved in?

561
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:09,619
Listen!

562
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:13,248
I learned everything from you!

563
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:16,251
And the other detectives
are learning from me!

564
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:19,087
I won't give up on this case.

565
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:23,550
I will see to it until the end.

566
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:31,266
That bastard.

567
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:44,821
VIOLENT CRIMES TEAM 1

568
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:46,906
Did Sang-yun call yet?

569
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:48,199
Is he not picking up?

570
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:51,160
He's not picking up my calls.

571
00:47:51,578 --> 00:47:52,870
Should we put an APB out for him?

572
00:47:52,996 --> 00:47:55,623
You think he's a criminal or something?

573
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:58,334
He's a cop

574
00:47:59,294 --> 00:48:01,004
who'll return soon

575
00:48:02,005 --> 00:48:03,047
to get his badge back.

576
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:08,636
-Sir.
-Yes?

577
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:12,140
We got a call that someone saw
Choi Ro-hee at Sokcho.

578
00:48:12,724 --> 00:48:13,600
And?

579
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:16,019
And that call was made by Detective Park.

580
00:48:18,605 --> 00:48:20,440
That brat must be onto something.

581
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:23,568
Keep calling him.

582
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:27,864
Get ready to move
as soon as he picks up, got it?

583
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:29,032
Yes, sir!

584
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:30,867
Don't smirk, you brat.

585
00:48:36,873 --> 00:48:37,874
What's with him?

586
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:42,337
She'll try to leave the country
in any way possible!

587
00:48:42,879 --> 00:48:45,131
I'll pay you however much you need,
so go find her.

588
00:48:46,049 --> 00:48:48,885
You can kill her for all I care!
Just bring my suitcase back.

589
00:48:53,765 --> 00:48:56,267
DONGGEURAN COMPUTERS

590
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:57,769
Did you decrypt the password?

591
00:48:58,186 --> 00:49:00,271
I decrypted the password pretty quickly…

592
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:05,985
but I think you'll be angrier
when you hear this.

593
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:08,196
Why?

594
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:09,489
Well…

595
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:12,909
This is registered to a device.

596
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:16,788
So in other words,
it can't be opened on other devices,

597
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:18,998
except for the laptop

598
00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:22,752
that it's been designated to.

599
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:38,601
You're pissed, aren't you?

600
00:49:39,102 --> 00:49:40,061
Your eyes are…

601
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:46,776
CHOI HO-YEONG

602
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:58,287
That's enough. I think it's all dry.

603
00:49:58,371 --> 00:50:01,290
No, it's not. It's cold out.
You'll catch a cold.

604
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:03,167
This is so bothersome.

605
00:50:03,418 --> 00:50:04,919
How is this bothersome?

606
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:06,879
What's wrong with this?

607
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:10,258
Turn your head around.

608
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:12,468
This is so absurd.

609
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:13,803
What did you say?

610
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:15,388
Why are you murmuring by yourself?

611
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:17,098
Stop talking casually to an adult!

612
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:18,641
He's right. Stop talking casually.

613
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:23,855
Treating me like that
won't do you any good.

614
00:50:25,273 --> 00:50:27,650
I have a shocking piece of information.

615
00:50:29,444 --> 00:50:30,528
What is it?

616
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,071
I'll tell you…

617
00:50:32,822 --> 00:50:34,449
if you buy me a meal.

618
00:50:34,574 --> 00:50:35,616
What?

619
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:38,578
We're very hungry right now.

620
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:43,499
Do you think cops go around
buying people food?

621
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,710
He's right. They don't do that.

622
00:50:56,012 --> 00:50:57,054
Why aren't you eating?

623
00:50:57,472 --> 00:50:58,389
What?

624
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,141
I'm eating.

625
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,686
You normally finish a bowl of rice by now.

626
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:06,814
It's odd that you still have
so much rice left.

627
00:51:07,148 --> 00:51:08,274
You eat up.

628
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:11,486
I just have an upset stomach.

629
00:51:12,445 --> 00:51:14,614
Stop going off-topic and tell me.

630
00:51:14,781 --> 00:51:16,324
What's the information?

631
00:51:18,493 --> 00:51:20,203
What's the estimated date of the incident?

632
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:22,538
May 20th.

633
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:24,665
And you were kidnapped by him on the 21st

634
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:27,001
while you were leaving the house.

635
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:30,254
That's the strange part.

636
00:51:31,214 --> 00:51:32,048
What?

637
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:35,676
My memory stops on the 20th.

638
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:40,807
My mom brought home
the Chinese food that I like on the 19th.

639
00:51:41,057 --> 00:51:43,643
Then the next day,
I went down to my dad's lab.

640
00:51:44,644 --> 00:51:47,355
Dad never keeps me in the lab
for over eight hours.

641
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:50,316
If I went down
in the afternoon on the 20th,

642
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,984
I would've been up by the evening.

643
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:55,196
But I woke up on the 21st this time.

644
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:58,241
-That means…
-Before the 20th passed,

645
00:51:59,075 --> 00:52:00,868
someone put me to sleep again.

646
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:09,877
Ms. Seo Hye-eun?

647
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:13,256
Yes. I think it's time
to start tying things up.

648
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:15,800
Hye-eun is the only parent Hee-ae has now.

649
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,343
I want to make sure she knows that

650
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:20,513
and tell her not to leave Hee-ae alone.

651
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:27,270
I know it's difficult,
but that's why I'm asking you as a favor.

652
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:29,856
I won't go anywhere without Ro-hee.

653
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:33,192
So please, just give me

654
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:35,444
one day.

655
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:37,154
By any chance,

656
00:52:37,864 --> 00:52:39,574
is there something that I don't know?

657
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:46,205
Ms. Seo is somehow connected
to both the kidnapping and the murder.

658
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:50,042
But the murderer is denying
his relationship with her,

659
00:52:50,293 --> 00:52:53,921
and the kidnapper is also denying
her involvement in the case.

660
00:52:55,882 --> 00:52:56,799
Are you certain…

661
00:52:58,467 --> 00:53:01,012
that Ms. Seo isn't involved
in this case at all?

662
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:08,936
You're going to leave me
with this incompetent cop?

663
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:11,731
We have no choice since we have two cars.

664
00:53:12,148 --> 00:53:14,317
I won't let you trick me again
by letting you two drive alone.

665
00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:16,277
What if the kidnapper runs away?

666
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:18,613
You won't be suspended then.
You'll get fired.

667
00:53:19,322 --> 00:53:21,741
I wouldn't be here
if I was worried about that.

668
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:22,742
Also,

669
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,121
it's common sense that being with a cop
is safer than being with a kidnapper.

670
00:53:28,664 --> 00:53:30,249
Why doesn't common sense work here?

671
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,587
-Bulgogi burger.
-What?

672
00:53:34,921 --> 00:53:37,256
I'm going to have
a bulgogi burger for dinner.

673
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:39,425
Make sure to come back on time
so I won't be hungry.

674
00:53:46,015 --> 00:53:47,099
Thank you.

675
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,519
No need to thank me.

676
00:53:51,604 --> 00:53:54,023
I know you won't run off without Ro-hee.

677
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:55,650
I know it,

678
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:57,401
but still,

679
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:00,571
don't get any ideas.

680
00:54:01,781 --> 00:54:02,740
Okay.

681
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,270
You're late.

682
00:54:35,398 --> 00:54:36,357
I'm sorry.

683
00:54:38,401 --> 00:54:40,111
I have something important
in my hands now.

684
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:42,238
It's halfway to success.

685
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:44,740
Do you drink?

686
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:56,002
Here.

687
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:01,007
A drink won't hurt
after a hard day of work.

688
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:05,636
There you go.

689
00:55:12,268 --> 00:55:13,310
However,

690
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:16,856
halfway to success, in other words,

691
00:55:17,273 --> 00:55:18,899
is halfway to failure.

692
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:22,194
Taking responsibility for our failures

693
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:25,031
comes with the job we do, right?

694
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:30,161
You see,

695
00:55:31,037 --> 00:55:32,830
I've never liked your uncanny vibe.

696
00:55:34,165 --> 00:55:35,666
The same goes for your loyalty

697
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:37,835
and doing whatever it takes
to complete your orders.

698
00:55:39,045 --> 00:55:40,880
It's overly dramatic and idealistic.

699
00:55:49,055 --> 00:55:52,391
You should've listened
and gotten on the yacht with the kid.

700
00:55:52,475 --> 00:55:54,769
Why did you have to pity her?

701
00:55:59,982 --> 00:56:01,275
Ideals…

702
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:04,070
can't outweigh money.

703
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:24,131
How does it feel?

704
00:56:24,757 --> 00:56:26,592
This is an order from the higher-ups,

705
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:28,886
so you should die like a loyal dog.

706
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:41,649
How did it feel
when you put a gun in my mouth?

707
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:44,235
If the boss told you to kill me,

708
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,487
you would've shot me
then and there, right?

709
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:55,162
Beg me to spare your life.

710
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:57,998
Then I'll stop here.

711
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:12,054
Gosh, he's so stubborn.

712
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:36,203
How dramatic.

713
00:57:58,601 --> 00:57:59,810
How beautiful.

714
00:58:19,872 --> 00:58:20,831
Hello?

715
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:24,043
Please send her up.

716
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:44,271
I've wired everything
to the cryptocurrency account in the US.

717
00:58:45,231 --> 00:58:46,941
Thank you for choosing our bank.

718
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:49,902
Thank you for your work.

719
00:58:55,366 --> 00:58:57,326
INCOMING CALL

720
00:58:58,410 --> 00:58:59,536
I'll be going.

721
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:16,762
It's me.

722
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:19,473
Let's meet.

723
00:59:20,933 --> 00:59:22,226
Let's meet and talk.

724
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:34,775
Why is Kim Myeong-jun here?

725
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:36,068
Those two are close.

726
01:01:36,235 --> 01:01:38,320
Mr. Kim, stay by my side.

727
01:01:39,113 --> 01:01:40,114
It's me, Mom.

728
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:41,240
Mom?

729
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:42,991
Hee-ae, are you okay?

730
01:01:43,075 --> 01:01:44,201
Are you not sick anymore?

731
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:46,453
A genius girl who's left alone
after her parents' death.

732
01:01:46,537 --> 01:01:48,789
She'll be alone if it ends like this.

733
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:51,834
Mr. Kim must need some time too.

734
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:54,545
The kidnapper and a detective.

735
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:56,171
Let's catch Jaden first.

736
01:01:56,255 --> 01:01:58,674
Yesterday's enemy can be today's friend.

737
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:01,218
We could team up if our goals align.

738
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:02,469
Don't try so hard.

739
01:02:02,553 --> 01:02:05,222
If I hadn't been disowned,
all of that would've been mine.

740
01:02:05,597 --> 01:02:07,808
What is Ms. Seo Hye-eun to you?

741
01:02:07,975 --> 01:02:10,811
What is she to you
that you even murdered someone for her?

742
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:12,980
It was a decision I made on my own.

743
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:16,275
Your decision may determine
Ro-hee's safety.

744
01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:17,651
I have something to show you.

745
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:20,487
I don't want to watch it anymore.

746
01:02:20,612 --> 01:02:21,989
It's important.

747
01:02:22,114 --> 01:02:23,782
It concerns your safety as well.

748
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:27,035
You promised to stay with me
until my memories come back!

749
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:29,246
I want you to be safe even without me.

750
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:30,998
Then just stay by my side.

751
01:02:31,123 --> 01:02:32,291
I'm a kidnapper!

752
01:02:33,584 --> 01:02:35,586
