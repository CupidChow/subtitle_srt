1
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,663
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS, GROUPS,

2
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:04,448
AND SETTINGS ARE FICTITIOUS,
AND CHILD SAFETY GUIDELINES WERE FOLLOWED

3
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:50,069
Kim Myeong-jun!

4
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,366
You'll get scolded
for going into the church.

5
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:58,577
That's why we should hide here
so the others can't find us.

6
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,133
Wait for me!

7
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:15,177
Quiet down and follow me!

8
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:48,919
Don't try so hard.

9
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,507
Our prayers have never been answered
since we were young.

10
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,484
It's been a while
since we've been here, right?

11
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,733
It looked huge back then.

12
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:13,235
But it's smaller than I remember.

13
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,696
You still remember this place?

14
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:19,366
I tried so hard to forget about it.

15
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:25,497
The sister always brought us here
whenever we caused trouble.

16
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:27,708
"Look at the cross."

17
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:30,294
"You shouldn't lie in front of it."

18
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,714
"If you're honest,

19
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,300
then you'll be forgiven."

20
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,845
If you're honest, can you be forgiven?

21
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,392
Can you?

22
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:47,889
Is that how the world works?

23
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,403
Don't beat around the bush and ask.

24
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:01,158
Ask me what you want to know.

25
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:06,830
Why did you go…

26
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,041
to that house?

27
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,544
Why did you meet…

28
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:14,922
Ro-hee's dad?

29
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:19,802
It was initially mine.

30
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,265
Ro-hee's dad, Choi Jin-tae,

31
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,394
was the kid who was newly adopted
after I was disowned.

32
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,022
If I hadn't been disowned,
all of that would've been mine.

33
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:34,650
I wanted to see…

34
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,653
what mine looked like

35
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,572
and how great it was.

36
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:54,086
Why are you standing around? Take a seat.

37
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,334
And also for our plan.

38
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:38,130
You were supposed to break in
and kidnap Ro-hee.

39
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:41,467
To do that, we should at least know
the layout of the inside.

40
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:47,347
Is all you wanted to know

41
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:48,891
the reason why I went there?

42
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,060
- Hye-eun.
- Myeong-jun.

43
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,734
If you wanted to see me
after watching the CCTV footage,

44
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:03,155
I'm sure you aren't here to ask
why I went there.

45
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:07,701
So say it.
What on earth do you want to know?

46
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:09,661
Hye-eun.

47
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,331
It's not you, right?

48
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:13,498
What do you mean?

49
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,126
What are you insinuating?

50
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:17,544
I'm hoping…

51
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:23,050
that you aren't the murderer.

52
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:30,557
You're…

53
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,021
"hoping"?

54
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:46,240
If I tell you the truth,

55
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:51,161
would you believe me?

56
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,142
So this is why you wanted to meet here.

57
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,269
Before the cross.

58
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,981
I'll be forgiven if I say the truth,

59
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:21,567
and I'll be punished if I lie.

60
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,111
You're here to coax me.

61
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:30,576
My prayers…

62
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,621
were answered back then.

63
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:38,834
The day you left this place,

64
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,380
I prayed that you'd return.

65
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:51,847
Hye-eun.

66
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,227
I'll pray on your behalf.

67
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,816
Let's go.

68
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:42,147
CHAPTER 11. SMOKING GUN

69
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,971
BASED ON THE NOVEL
<i>THE DAY OF KIDNAPPING</i> BY JEONG HAE-YEON

70
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,490
Do you want to drop by the rest area?

71
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,493
You want some snacks or drinks?

72
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,371
Don't try to break the awkward silence.

73
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,873
That makes it even more awkward.

74
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:03,710
Don't tell me…

75
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:08,340
you tricked me into
going to the station or something.

76
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:11,677
I keep my promises, so don't worry.

77
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,640
I'm surprised you're not asking

78
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,850
where Mr. Kim Myeong-jun went.

79
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,605
He must need some time too.

80
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:35,866
Come in.

81
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,167
This is surprising.

82
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,334
What is?

83
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:48,297
I didn't expect you
to live in such a clean house.

84
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,216
Well, I'm rarely home.

85
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:52,592
Are you a workaholic?

86
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:54,261
That's even more surprising.

87
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,472
Do you have a laptop?

88
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,100
Laptop? Why?

89
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:02,578
YOUNGIN HOSPITAL
DIRECTOR AND WIFE MURDER CASE

00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,002
SEVERELY PUNISH THE BRUTAL MURDERER

91
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:05,897
Will you be okay?

92
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,568
This is too graphic, even more so for you.

93
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:13,780
Reading about the situation
may help me regain my memory.

94
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:17,576
You need input
to bring your memories back.

95
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,258
YOUNGIN GENERAL HOSPITAL

96
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:41,099
Take care of Hee-ae.

97
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,268
And…

98
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,313
don't worry.

99
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:50,108
I'll give you the CCTV footage

100
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,027
before I go to the police.

101
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:57,199
Are you threatening me
to take care of Hee-ae?

102
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:58,658
I'm asking you a favor.

103
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:04,122
What were you praying about…

104
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,222
while you were waiting for me back there?

105
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:11,296
You said your prayers were answered.

106
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,467
Hee-ae's health.

107
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,637
And happiness.

108
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,558
That's it?

109
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:51,327
Are you sure it's Seo Hye-eun?

110
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:52,628
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

111
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:55,757
What an interesting woman.

112
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,513
Hello, this is Jaden.

113
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,890
I'm sorry to keep asking you for favors,

114
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:06,393
but this is something only you can find.

115
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,189
Who are you, ma'am?

116
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,068
Hee-ae's mom.

117
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,584
Who are you?

118
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,252
It's me, Mom.

119
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:33,837
Mom?

120
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:37,716
Gosh, you're her mother?

121
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,386
I'll be outside.

122
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,804
You two can chat.

123
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,357
Are you really Mom?

124
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:55,901
Are you okay?

125
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:57,527
Yes.

126
00:12:58,487 --> 00:12:59,738
Where's Dad?

127
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,002
He left.

128
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:18,798
He won't be coming back.

129
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:20,842
Is it because he went to earn money?

130
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,221
Dad said

131
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,600
that you couldn't come to see me
because you were making money,

132
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:33,480
and that's why he was staying with me.

133
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,317
If you're staying with me now,

134
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,445
does that mean Dad went to make money?

135
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:44,866
How funny.

136
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:57,963
Will you…

137
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,882
be living with me from now on?

138
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,386
For the time being.

139
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:08,932
That's probably safe.

140
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,030
I knew it.

141
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:28,076
Did I ask for such a difficult favor?

142
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:29,911
Hamburger!

143
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:32,414
Is it so hard to buy a hamburger?

144
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,457
Why are you making me starve?

145
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,835
I'm sorry. I forgot.

146
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,837
How could you forget?

147
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:43,383
Do you still not know how sensitive I get
when I skip a meal?

148
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,719
Fine, I get it. I'll go buy one right now.

149
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,429
Where do you think you're going?

150
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,431
What if someone recognizes you?

151
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:51,683
Hold on.

152
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,107
Hey, three bulgogi burgers.

153
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,483
Four if you want one too.

154
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:16,416
Why did you ask me to get burgers
when you rarely have them?

155
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,335
Did you starve or something?

156
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:20,587
Gosh.

157
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,631
And also,

158
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:25,675
you shouldn't hang up
as soon as you're done talking.

159
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,218
That's not… You have guests.

160
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:28,552
Hello.

161
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:31,640
Put your hands up!

162
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:34,184
Ro-hee!

163
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:36,978
Hurry up and put your hands up.

164
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:38,938
He won't shoot anyway.

165
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,107
Put them down.

166
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,737
And why should I put my hands up?
I'm the victim here.

167
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:48,657
You're right.

168
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,077
Jeong-man, sit down and eat.

169
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,913
Sir, what in the world…

170
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,706
Why is Kim Myeong-jun here?

171
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,333
Hey, you bought four.

172
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,543
Come on. Let's eat.

173
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,296
Man…

174
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:05,214
Thank you for the burger.

175
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:13,223
You should wrap half of the burger,
so you don't spill.

176
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,141
What do you mean? This paper is trash.

177
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,143
You're supposed to remove it
and eat the burger.

178
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,688
But still, you shouldn't make a mess.

179
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,439
This isn't our house.

180
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,484
Until when do I have
to suffer from a kidnapper's nagging?

181
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:25,652
Any interesting news?

182
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,900
I doubt there's anything
more interesting than this.

183
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:34,619
Can you get a hold of the CCTV footage

184
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,330
and dashcams in the area from May 20th?

185
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,541
- May 20th?
- Yes.

186
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,793
There wasn't anything particular
last time we checked.

187
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,920
That day might be
when the actual murder happened.

188
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,130
So let's check again.

189
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:46,339
Okay.

190
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,464
Also…

191
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:52,345
Whatever.

192
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:56,558
Choi Dong-jun called us to see
if we have one of Dr. Choi's items.

193
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:57,761
He was looking for a laptop.

194
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,394
We have it as evidence.

195
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,229
A laptop? All of a sudden?

196
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:02,522
It's Jaden's doing.

197
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:07,068
Jaden? Dr. Choi's partner?

198
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:08,737
You met him?

199
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:09,779
Yes.

200
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,407
He's a wicked bastard.
You need to catch him.

201
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,076
He's going to be a big threat to Ro-hee.

202
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:18,496
What a sight.

203
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,665
A kidnapper is worrying about his victim.

204
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,126
Jaden kidnapped and locked us up.

205
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,086
He's nastier than a kidnapper.

206
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:29,257
At this rate, he'll approach me again
even if you close the case.

207
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:30,884
Let's catch Jaden first.

208
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,640
Yes, let's do that.

209
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,768
But what can we arrest him for?

210
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,770
He took my pendant.

211
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,689
You can arrest him for theft.

212
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,900
To do that,
someone needs to report a theft.

213
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,193
If he did take your pendant,

214
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:51,070
you'd have to report it
to start an investigation.

215
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:53,948
On top of that,
we can't lock him up for that.

216
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,743
A civilian is asking a cop
to catch a bad guy.

217
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,204
Do I have to tell you
what you should arrest him for?

218
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,791
Our job isn't catching bad guys
you randomly select.

219
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:06,461
And why you are talking casually
to an adult, you little brat?

220
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,088
Gosh, you people and your honorifics.

221
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,508
Are all cops stuck up?

222
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:13,426
You brat!

223
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:16,721
Hey, what's the point
of arguing with an 11-year-old?

224
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:19,474
I wasn't arguing.

225
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,019
I should go home.

226
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,770
Home?

227
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:26,314
Your house?

228
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:28,358
What I need is my memory of the 20th.

229
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,820
My memories might come back if I go home.

230
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,615
That way I'll know who murdered my dad.

231
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:39,035
We'll see if it's the man
who's behind bars,

232
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:41,120
or someone else.

233
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,379
It's still too dangerous.

234
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:50,755
I know.

235
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,719
And I know
I have to take responsibility for it.

236
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:55,301
Let's wrap up the case then.

237
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,142
When we're trying to solve a case,

238
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:07,188
we try to read into the minds
of the culprit we're after.

239
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,775
But have we ever considered
the victim's situation

240
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,278
after the case was solved?

241
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:14,946
All the time.

242
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:18,199
We work harder
because we think about the victims.

243
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,742
Then what about Ro-hee?

244
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:23,371
Ro-hee…

245
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,457
She'll be fine on her own.

246
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,794
And there are experts who will help her.

247
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,925
A genius girl who's left alone
after her parents' death.

248
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:40,972
She'll be alone if it ends like this.

249
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:45,476
I think we should help her
get back on her feet

250
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:50,315
and foster an environment
to help her live alone.

251
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:52,775
As you've seen,

252
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:55,445
those two are close.

253
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:00,575
Ro-hee gets anxious
without Mr. Kim Myeong-jun,

254
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,076
and Mr. Kim

255
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:05,038
is willing to risk his life
to protect her.

256
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,458
But still…

257
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:12,837
Give me a few days.

258
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,674
It won't take long.

259
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,349
<i>I received a call from my attorney,</i>

260
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:28,227
<i>and Dr. Choi's laptop
is still under investigation.</i>

261
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:31,773
They're still investigating
when the murder case is closed?

262
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,775
<i>That's what the higher-ups
in the force told me.</i>

263
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,027
<i>I'll ask them to return it
as soon as possible.</i>

264
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,540
Ro-hee just fell asleep.

265
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,542
She must've been tired today.

266
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:54,963
It'd be weird if she wasn't.

267
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,092
Every single day, including today,
must've been hard for her.

268
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,721
Anyway,

269
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:06,975
I'm glad you came back.

270
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,771
Thank you for trusting me.

271
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,611
Things won't be easy
when an official investigation begins.

272
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:21,489
I understand how much
you love your daughter,

273
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:23,700
but your decision

274
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:26,202
may determine Ro-hee's safety.

275
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:32,582
Okay.

276
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:52,103
Dr. Mo Eun-sun.

277
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,731
We've met before.

278
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:56,774
We're the police.

279
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,028
What brings you here?

280
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:03,698
A man was found
in your hospital yesterday.

281
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,323
So?

282
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:09,120
You're answering like this is nothing,
but it's a serious matter.

283
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:11,347
I'm afraid you'll have to come with us.

284
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,294
If you're summoning me,
then I'll go with my attorney tomorrow.

285
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:18,046
I'm a bit tired today.

286
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:21,007
Did you do it yourself?

287
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:24,302
Did you tie up the man?

288
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,930
That man is over 175cm tall.

289
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:30,141
And he was previously a member of a gang.

290
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,727
I believe it would've been
too difficult for you

291
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,645
to have done that alone.

292
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:37,857
So who was it?

293
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,026
Who helped you?

294
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:44,447
If you're not going to arrest me,
I'll see you tomorrow.

295
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,873
Damn it, screw this. Let's leave.

296
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:21,818
- Did you bring it?
- Yes.

297
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:27,949
Goodness.

298
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,711
The kidnapper and a detective.

299
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:03,526
Ro-hee.

300
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:05,986
Hold on.

301
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,000
Detective Park,
could we talk for a second?

302
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:11,033
- Sure.
- Okay.

303
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:13,619
Don't go in and stay there, okay?

304
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,596
Is it okay for her to enter the house?

305
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:33,972
Right.

306
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:35,850
We haven't cleaned up everything yet.

307
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:42,523
I imagined Ro-hee
coming back to this house.

308
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,444
And I thought about
how she'll live here by herself

309
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,697
with all the traces.

310
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:53,659
Detective Park.

311
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:56,370
I'd like to erase those traces.

312
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:57,747
Would that be okay?

313
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:15,723
What did you two talk about?

314
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:16,933
What?

315
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,392
It's nothing.

316
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:20,269
Ro-hee.

317
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:24,565
Go sit over there for a bit.

318
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:26,233
Just give us a second.

319
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:20,056
Ro-hee!

320
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:22,933
Come on in.

321
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:27,391
FLIGHTS FROM INCHEON

322
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,073
Can kids eat these?

323
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:46,285
I don't think the mom
will have the time to eat them.

324
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,953
I thought there were cops outside.

325
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,669
I know how many cops
and CCTVS are in this hospital,

326
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:57,171
but I still came anyway.

327
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:02,468
The fact that I still came

328
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,179
means that I'd like to
have a conversation.

329
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:12,978
Yesterday's enemy can be today's friend.

330
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:16,315
We could team up if our goals align.

331
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:21,737
So are you here to ask me
to work with you or fight you?

332
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,657
I'll know after we talk.

333
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:28,327
Surely there was nothing wrong
with what I gave you.

334
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:32,289
I think it was quite a fair deal,

335
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:34,527
so why are you making a big fuss?

336
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:39,505
It was mine to begin with,

337
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,590
so it's unfair to pay money for it.

338
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,551
You should've held onto it then.

339
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:48,597
Option one.

340
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:51,892
You were the mastermind
of the kidnapping case,

341
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:55,854
and somehow,
you ended up acquiring Dr. Choi's pendant.

342
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,233
Cops would love to hear that story.

343
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:01,151
You're kidding me.

344
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:04,154
What a lame blackmail.

345
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:05,656
Then what about you?

346
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:10,286
Locking up a kidnapper
and a victim is a serious crime.

347
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:12,538
On top of that,

348
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:14,957
if that experiment goes public,

349
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,834
X Capital's image would collapse.

350
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:20,337
Then how will you return the money
to the investors?

351
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:25,134
Nice shot.

352
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,094
Great insight.

353
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,599
As you and I just said,
we both lose in option one.

354
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:33,892
Now, option two.

355
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:38,272
Dr. Choi's laptop is in his house.

356
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:42,651
Unfortunately, I can only see the contents
of the pendant with that laptop.

357
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:46,864
Bring it.

358
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:50,034
Then we finalize
this ten-million-dollar deal.

359
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:53,996
The deal was finalized

360
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:58,208
when I gave you that key!

361
00:31:58,751 --> 00:31:59,751
Listen!

362
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:03,505
The deal was for me to acquire
Dr. Choi's research materials.

363
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:09,678
If you do this, you don't have to run away
for the rest of your life.

364
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,104
Don't make this any harder.

365
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:21,898
Right.

366
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:26,945
The kidnapper, Ro-hee, and a detective
are at Dr. Choi's house.

367
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,490
Use your tricks

368
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:32,117
and bring me that laptop…

369
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:34,607
unless you want to see me again.

370
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:47,257
Any materials?

371
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:48,926
Probably none.

372
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:52,721
I doubt my dad would've kept the files
on an unsecured laptop.

373
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:58,477
<i>How dare you touch Ro-hee's records?
Are you crazy?!</i>

374
00:32:59,228 --> 00:33:00,312
"Ro-hee's records"?

375
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:02,189
I'm trying to leave a real record.

376
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:05,776
I'm guessing…

377
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:10,197
the flash drive is my pendant
that Jaden took.

378
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,296
And he's probably looking for this laptop

379
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:14,446
since it's the only way
to access the contents of it.

380
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,288
We have to find my pendant.

381
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,085
I'd better report him…

382
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:26,130
for theft.

383
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:38,892
Goodness.

384
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,730
So?

385
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:47,401
Does being back home recall any memories?

386
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:48,986
No.

387
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,991
By the way, why are you so obsessed
with my memory?

388
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:58,203
Well, because you seem frustrated.

389
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,499
So I was hoping your memories
would come back soon.

390
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,251
Hope, my foot.

391
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,129
Going to prison isn't hopeful.

392
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:11,300
Go to bed.

393
00:34:12,468 --> 00:34:14,970
Have a sweet dream tonight, okay?

394
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:18,390
I've never had any good dreams
sleeping on this bed.

395
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:25,647
You'll have sweet dreams from now on.

396
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:29,902
There are people
who truly care about you now.

397
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,989
I've always thought

398
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:37,451
it'd be good for you
to go back to where you were.

399
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:39,953
But…

400
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,583
watching you in this bed in this house,

401
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,170
I feel relieved and proud.

402
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,006
You're just a kidnapper.

403
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:54,009
Go to bed.

404
00:34:56,053 --> 00:34:57,054
Mr. Kim.

405
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:02,601
When I wake up tomorrow,

406
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:07,648
be by my side.

407
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,492
Of course. Don't worry.

408
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:23,914
Go to sleep.

409
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:42,349
If you broke into the house

410
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:44,017
and took Ro-hee in her sleep,

411
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:45,978
you would've met Mr. Park Cheol-won.

412
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:49,398
If things went awry,

413
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:52,317
you might've also taken the blame
for the murder.

414
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,946
Or you might've been murdered
by Mr. Park Cheol-won.

415
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,535
Stumbling across Ro-hee

416
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,870
might've been a stroke of luck
for the both of you.

417
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:07,708
I doubt it.

418
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,337
I'll be out tomorrow.

419
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:15,299
I have to confirm some things
before I conclude the case.

420
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:18,010
I can trust you, right?

421
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:21,388
Yes. Thank you.

422
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:35,235
- Hello.
- Hello.

423
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:38,863
- Hello.
- Hello.

424
00:36:38,906 --> 00:36:40,908
- Hey, Byeol.
- Have a good day, Byeol.

425
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:05,891
I brought back your car.

426
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:15,108
You didn't have to come.

427
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:17,277
I was going to Youngin Station anyway.

428
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:20,030
That's why I came.

429
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,339
I want to give Kim Myeong-jun and Ro-hee

430
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:23,867
one more day.

431
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,495
And when the case closes after that,

432
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:28,914
I'm going after Jaden.

433
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:31,375
How do you know him?

434
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:33,627
I wondered where I saw him,

435
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:37,172
and it was when I went to your hospital.

436
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,344
A lot has happened in the past month.

437
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:44,429
Murder, kidnapping, and…

438
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:47,516
a series of mysterious situations.

439
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:50,018
But all of them

440
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:52,062
point in one direction.

441
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:57,067
Choi Ro-hee, the Genius Child Project,

442
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:58,610
and…

443
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,238
people's greed for them.

444
00:38:04,825 --> 00:38:06,451
You don't have to come in today.

445
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:09,997
I'll come again when the case is closed.

446
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:23,134
What?

447
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:26,596
What's this?
This isn't the sauce that I like.

448
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:29,891
There's also too much onion.

449
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,394
Jalapeño for an 11-year-old kid?

450
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,148
And I don't drink cola.

451
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:39,151
Why can't you just thank him and eat?

452
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:42,154
I can't thank him
for this atrocious sandwich.

453
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:44,998
Shouldn't you ask about people's
preferences before buying a sandwich?

454
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:46,950
Why would you order one to your own taste?

455
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:49,411
This is driving me crazy.

456
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:50,829
Give it to me then. I'll have it.

457
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:54,499
I said it wasn't what I wanted,
not that I wasn't going to eat it.

458
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,640
What kind of relationship do you two have?

459
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:01,882
Aren't you a cop?

460
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:04,217
The kidnapper and the kidnapped child.

461
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:10,766
You should use honorifics to adults.

462
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,559
Stop talking casually!

463
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:16,605
Then he should've asked my preferences
and ordered a proper sandwich.

464
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:19,816
You make it sound like
I committed an unforgivable sin.

465
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:21,526
I apologize on her behalf.

466
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,195
No need. Eat up.

467
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:25,238
Please eat.

468
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:30,869
Right.

469
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:34,831
Hee-ae woke up.

470
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:37,876
- Really?
- Yes.

471
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:40,921
Detective Park said to tell him
if you want to see her.

472
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:43,340
He said he knows
you must've been worried sick.

473
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:47,552
Do you want to go see her?

474
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:05,112
Ro-hee.

475
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:09,199
You can go. You wanted to see her.

476
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:12,953
Why don't you come with me?

477
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,664
I think she'll be happy to see you.

478
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:17,634
Why would she be happy
when we're strangers?

479
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:23,463
Hold on.

480
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,146
Give this to her.

481
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,982
- A bunny doll?
- This isn't just a bunny doll.

482
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,651
It's from the most famous
doll company in Germany.

483
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,361
You can't buy it with money.

484
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,116
Give it to her proudly.

485
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:59,583
I want you to give this to her yourself.

486
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,293
Can you do that?

487
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:23,648
This is the dashcam footage
from May 21st, near Dr. Choi's house.

488
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:24,900
Did you find anything?

489
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:27,068
There's nothing in particular on the 20th.

490
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:29,321
But on the 21st, around 1:10 a.m.,

491
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:31,781
Mr. Park Cheol-won
went into Dr. Choi's house.

492
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:33,282
What?

493
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,203
If you see here,
he comes out an hour and a half later.

494
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:40,207
Are you sure this is the morning
of the 21st, not the evening?

495
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:44,294
This is the combined dashcam footage
of the 21st,

496
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:48,006
and I couldn't find him
going into the house in the evening.

497
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:49,466
Replay it.

498
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:51,134
Sure. Here.

499
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:54,095
- No, from when he first comes out.
- Right, okay.

500
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:56,640
Here.

501
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:03,146
- About his savings account you mentioned.
- Yes.

502
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,870
Ms. Seo Hye-eun withdrew the money
from it right after meeting him.

503
00:42:07,234 --> 00:42:09,069
- Right after?
- Yes.

504
00:42:09,236 --> 00:42:12,405
And Mr. Park also withdrew
a large amount of money.

505
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:14,115
Fifty million won.

506
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:16,117
Fifty…

507
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,787
That's Hee-ae's surgery fee.

508
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:19,870
Yes.

509
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:24,042
He withdrew the money
and made the payment on May 24th.

510
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:35,720
Hey, Hee-ae. You're up.

511
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:38,555
Dad!

512
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:57,325
Hee-ae, are you okay?
Are you not sick anymore?

513
00:42:57,534 --> 00:42:58,534
I'm okay.

514
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,787
I can eat now.

515
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:07,210
I'm so proud of you.

516
00:43:08,712 --> 00:43:11,464
Thank you so much

517
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:13,591
for enduring through this.

518
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:17,011
Where's Mom?

519
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:19,096
Where did she go?

520
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:20,432
She went out for a bit.

521
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:24,436
She even watched me draw.

522
00:43:25,145 --> 00:43:27,105
Really? Were you happy?

523
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:28,272
Yes.

524
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:30,483
Goodness, my baby.

525
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:34,029
My sweet baby.

526
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:39,868
Who is she?

527
00:43:41,036 --> 00:43:42,037
Right.

528
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:44,873
Say hello. Her name is Ro-hee.

529
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:47,500
Hello, Ro-hee.

530
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:49,294
Hi.

531
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:54,174
She brought you a gift.

532
00:43:56,593 --> 00:43:58,762
Wow! It's a bunny doll.

533
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:01,097
It's not just a bunny doll.

534
00:44:01,181 --> 00:44:03,767
It's made by the most famous
doll company in Germany.

535
00:44:03,892 --> 00:44:05,185
You can't buy it with money.

536
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:07,354
Thank you, Ro-hee.

537
00:44:10,023 --> 00:44:11,107
Are you not sick anymore?

538
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,234
No.

539
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:14,652
The surgery went well.

540
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:16,821
That's a relief.

541
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:22,077
This is nice.

542
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:26,456
You're here, and I have a new friend.

543
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:30,001
Right, and Mom's back.

544
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:38,385
Why are you crying?

545
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:42,597
Just because…

546
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:52,482
I'm just…

547
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:55,777
really happy.

548
00:44:57,821 --> 00:45:00,490
I'm happy to see you healthy

549
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:02,909
and make a new friend.

550
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,578
I couldn't be any happier.

551
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:11,334
What about you? Are you happy too?

552
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:13,502
Well…

553
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:17,172
I am.

554
00:45:24,097 --> 00:45:25,097
My baby.

555
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:36,568
Let's go.

556
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:57,922
Myeong-jun.

557
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:36,544
<i>The kidnapper, Ro-hee, and a detective
are at Dr. Choi's house.</i>

558
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:40,507
<i>Use your tricks and bring me that laptop.</i>

559
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:47,388
On May 21st, around 1:10 a.m.,

560
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:51,100
you stayed in Dr. Choi's house
for about an hour and a half.

561
00:46:51,768 --> 00:46:55,480
Why did you lie
that you went there in the evening?

562
00:46:57,565 --> 00:46:59,192
Is that what I told you?

563
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:02,612
I must've been mistaken.

564
00:47:03,238 --> 00:47:05,615
Who are you making up this lie for?

565
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:08,201
- "Lie"?
- Is it for Ms. Seo Hye-eun?

566
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,998
I told you everything
during the last interrogation.

567
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:15,959
If you're going to ask me
the same questions,

568
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:17,669
then I'll get going.

569
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:21,714
A few days ago,

570
00:47:22,257 --> 00:47:24,217
as soon as the meeting
with you and Ms. Seo ended,

571
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:28,388
she withdrew all the money
from your savings account.

572
00:47:30,098 --> 00:47:31,724
Because I told her to.

573
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:34,686
You said the safe was empty, right?

574
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:36,854
And no one knows what was inside it

575
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:39,983
because you told us that it was empty

576
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:42,527
like Mr. Seo told you to say.

577
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:47,156
Then what's the real reason
behind killing Dr. Yoon Jeong-do?

578
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:51,619
Did Ms. Seo Hye-eun
order you to kill him too?

579
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:56,457
Dr. Yoon…

580
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:02,714
saw Hye-eun visit Dr. Choi a few times.

581
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:06,551
And he began to spread rumors
that they were having an affair.

582
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:09,679
When the murder occurred,

583
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:12,807
Dr. Yoon said
he'd tell the cops about her.

584
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:18,021
I was afraid
the investigation would point toward her.

585
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:20,690
It was a decision I made on my own.

586
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:26,487
Even if I take into account
your relationship with her,

587
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:29,240
this is beyond common sense.

588
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:32,577
What is Ms. Seo Hye-eun to you?

589
00:48:32,744 --> 00:48:34,120
What is she to you…

590
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:37,165
that you even murdered someone for her?

591
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:40,460
Hye-eun…

592
00:48:43,463 --> 00:48:45,006
is like a daughter to me.

593
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:52,722
All I want is for her to live happily.

594
00:48:57,894 --> 00:48:59,934
You withdrew 50 million won
not too long ago, right?

595
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:03,347
On that day, Hee-ae's hospital bills
were taken care of.

596
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:06,319
You're the one…

597
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:09,893
who paid for her surgery, right?

598
00:49:34,389 --> 00:49:35,723
Thank you for today.

599
00:49:42,814 --> 00:49:43,940
Mr. Kim.

600
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:46,651
Yes?

601
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:49,946
Detective Park
is in a difficult position right now.

602
00:49:50,697 --> 00:49:51,739
You know that, right?

603
00:49:52,949 --> 00:49:54,075
Yes.

604
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:56,828
Okay. You should go in.

605
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:57,995
Goodbye.

606
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:28,109
The ambiance in that room
feels too old for it to be my study.

607
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:29,902
I want to renovate it.

608
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:34,490
Including this living room
and the kitchen.

609
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:37,535
I want this to become a new house.

610
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:45,877
Which one should be Hee-ae's room?

611
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:48,254
You're her dad, so pick one.

612
00:50:49,297 --> 00:50:50,423
Hee-ae?

613
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:53,509
She said she'll visit,
and she might sleep over.

614
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,805
- Ro-hee...
- I think she'll be bothersome,

615
00:50:57,889 --> 00:50:59,515
but I'll get bored alone.

616
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:02,059
It's better to have someone
than to be bored.

617
00:51:03,478 --> 00:51:05,563
Tell her she can come to hang out often.

618
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:11,319
<i>Your decision
may determine Ro-hee's safety.</i>

619
00:51:16,324 --> 00:51:17,533
Why are you staring?

620
00:51:26,876 --> 00:51:28,336
I have something to show you.

621
00:51:29,879 --> 00:51:31,756
CHOI JIN-TAE'S HOUSE CCTV

622
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:37,887
Why should I watch this?

623
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:40,640
It's important.

624
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:55,905
I don't want to watch it anymore.

625
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:56,823
Ro-hee.

626
00:51:56,906 --> 00:51:58,366
I have no reason to watch it.

627
00:52:03,955 --> 00:52:05,498
Before the murder,

628
00:52:08,084 --> 00:52:11,045
- the person who came to this house...
- No! I don't want to hear it!

629
00:52:13,256 --> 00:52:14,298
Ro-hee!

630
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:19,929
Ro-hee!

631
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:25,434
It's important.
It concerns your safety as well.

632
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:27,103
I'm tired.

633
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:31,332
You've already watched it, haven't you?

634
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,868
CHOI JIN-TAE'S HOUSE CCTV

635
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:08,102
You watched it, right?

636
00:53:09,979 --> 00:53:10,980
Then…

637
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:13,232
are your memories back?

638
00:53:17,612 --> 00:53:18,738
What are you saying?

639
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,448
I don't remember anything.

640
00:53:21,991 --> 00:53:23,631
You remembered the moment you watched it.

641
00:53:23,743 --> 00:53:24,827
No.

642
00:53:24,911 --> 00:53:29,290
Call the detective and tell him
that my memories aren't coming back.

643
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,919
It's stuffy being inside.

644
00:53:33,002 --> 00:53:34,545
It was better when we were on the run.

645
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:37,048
- Ro-hee.
- Let's go outside tomorrow.

646
00:53:37,506 --> 00:53:38,841
Take me anywhere.

647
00:53:39,175 --> 00:53:40,843
Somewhere cool would be nice.

648
00:53:41,177 --> 00:53:42,529
- How about an amusement park?
- Choi Ro-hee!

649
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:43,638
They aren't back!

650
00:53:44,513 --> 00:53:46,182
My memories aren't back!

651
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:49,936
You promised to stay with me
until my memories come back.

652
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:53,490
I told you they aren't back.
Why do you keep insisting that they are?

653
00:53:58,861 --> 00:53:59,862
Ro-hee.

654
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:02,615
Listen.

655
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:06,410
I want you to be safe even without me.

656
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:08,454
Then just stay by my side.

657
00:54:09,205 --> 00:54:10,581
Ro-hee, that's…

658
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:26,680
Hee-ae.

659
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:28,848
Hee-ae.

660
00:54:31,227 --> 00:54:32,395
You can stay alone, right?

661
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:34,981
Mom, are you going somewhere?

662
00:54:35,231 --> 00:54:36,357
To earn money.

663
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:40,778
I thought you were going to stay with me

664
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:43,155
while Dad has gone to make money.

665
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:47,159
I'll…

666
00:54:48,536 --> 00:54:50,079
make more money.

667
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:56,627
- The child's safety comes first!
- Jeez.

668
00:54:56,711 --> 00:54:57,951
Make sure she doesn't get hurt.

669
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:06,762
- Sir.
- Stop!

670
00:55:08,431 --> 00:55:10,641
What do you think you're doing?

671
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:12,475
Excuse me!

672
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:14,979
Fancy seeing you here.

673
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,565
What brings you here?

674
00:55:17,732 --> 00:55:18,941
We received a report

675
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:22,653
that a cop and the kidnapper
are together in this house.

676
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:24,739
Are you the cop that was with him?

677
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:26,240
That's…

678
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:27,992
Let me explain.

679
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:29,326
I can explain.

680
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:31,704
But please let me meet
Kim Myeong-jun first.

681
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:35,791
What are you doing?

682
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:36,917
Sir.

683
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:38,294
Bring Kim Myeong-jun out.

684
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:39,420
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

685
00:55:55,061 --> 00:55:57,271
Are they also at the backdoor?
Should we jump the wall?

686
00:55:57,813 --> 00:55:59,482
All the walls are connected here,

687
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:02,068
so we just need to jump a few
to get to the road.

688
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:04,236
Ro-hee, stop.

689
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,198
Stop what?! Why would you stop right now?

690
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,324
You should think about
how we can get out of here.

691
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:14,121
Where are you going?

692
00:56:15,414 --> 00:56:17,792
We need to end this,
so we can start again.

693
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:20,419
Why would you end it when I'm not ready?

694
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:21,712
Did you forget?

695
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:23,339
You promised me

696
00:56:23,422 --> 00:56:26,258
that you'll stay by my side at all costs
until my memories come back.

697
00:56:26,342 --> 00:56:28,844
Stop it! Don't be stubborn!

698
00:56:29,345 --> 00:56:32,056
I'm a kidnapper!
I have to be punished for what I did!

699
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:34,809
I don't want you to go to jail!

700
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:36,769
Who's going to make

701
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:39,647
that unpleasant white <i>buchimgae</i>
if you go to jail?

702
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:43,109
Who am I going to scream at
and throw a fit when I'm upset?

703
00:56:45,236 --> 00:56:46,236
Mr. Kim…

704
00:56:46,278 --> 00:56:47,278
Ro-hee.

705
00:56:47,655 --> 00:56:49,990
We can't be on the run again.
You know that.

706
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:51,325
My goal…

707
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:55,579
was to bring you back here

708
00:56:55,663 --> 00:56:57,581
- and help you live safely.
- No.

709
00:56:57,665 --> 00:56:59,959
And that's all set. It's fine now.

710
00:57:00,126 --> 00:57:01,252
- Let's stop here.
- Mr. Kim.

711
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:04,088
I hate to admit this,

712
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:07,091
but I love being with you.

713
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:12,513
You're the first person

714
00:57:12,847 --> 00:57:15,057
who cared whether I was hungry,
sleepy, or bored,

715
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:18,727
and didn't want or expect
anything from me.

716
00:57:19,145 --> 00:57:20,604
Please don't go.

717
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:24,608
Don't go.

718
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:34,535
Listen.

719
00:57:35,536 --> 00:57:36,745
Listen, you fool!

720
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:39,415
I have to receive my punishment quickly…

721
00:57:41,167 --> 00:57:43,210
to be able to do that again.

722
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,879
No!

723
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:46,881
I don't want that.

724
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:52,261
You're just a kidnapper.
Why aren't you listening to me?

725
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:54,096
Stop. It's exhausting.

726
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:58,601
You said you'd protect me!

727
00:58:00,936 --> 00:58:01,936
Come here.

728
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:07,776
Thank you.

729
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:09,361
Thank you…

730
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:12,740
and I'm sorry.

731
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:15,326
I'm truly sorry.

732
00:58:15,451 --> 00:58:16,535
I'm so sorry.

733
00:58:19,872 --> 00:58:20,872
Go in.

734
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:24,168
Kim Myeong-jun, put your hands up.

735
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:25,127
Okay.

736
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:26,587
- Hands up!
- Stop.

737
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:28,547
- Okay.
- What's going on?

738
00:58:30,883 --> 00:58:31,800
Stop it!

739
00:58:31,884 --> 00:58:32,884
Are you okay?

740
00:58:32,927 --> 00:58:34,261
- Stop.
- Mr. Kim!

741
00:58:34,345 --> 00:58:37,890
- Stay still!
- Don't do that to him!

742
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:39,225
Don't do that to her!

743
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:40,476
Mr. Kim!

744
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:43,145
- Don't do that to him!
- Ro-hee!

745
00:58:43,312 --> 00:58:46,357
- Mr. Kim! Please!
- Ro-hee!

746
00:58:47,066 --> 00:58:48,150
No!

747
00:58:48,234 --> 00:58:50,694
Ro-hee!

748
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:54,365
Ro-hee!

749
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:02,706
<i>Mr. Kim!</i>

750
00:59:54,008 --> 00:59:55,217
<i>This is the beginning.</i>

751
00:59:55,301 --> 00:59:58,178
<i>Articles about Mr. Kim
will pour out endlessly.</i>

752
00:59:58,262 --> 00:59:59,638
Do you have an accomplice?

753
00:59:59,847 --> 01:00:01,140
This is all my doing.

754
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:05,102
Let's add Seo Hye-eun
to our list of suspects and locate her.

755
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:07,229
<i>The laptop disappeared.</i>

756
01:00:07,688 --> 01:00:10,232
Find my laptop and pendant first.

757
01:00:10,399 --> 01:00:12,568
<i>They're solid evidence for this case.</i>

758
01:00:13,277 --> 01:00:14,837
I guess I have to book my ticket again.

759
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:18,365
<i>We should clear up any misunderstandings
and false information.</i>

760
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:21,160
<i>That lady believes she's smart,</i>

761
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:22,828
so she'll come to face me head-on.

762
01:00:22,995 --> 01:00:23,829
Murder?

763
01:00:23,912 --> 01:00:26,665
<i>You barked up the wrong tree,
Ms. Choi Ro-hee.</i>

764
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:30,002
<i>Kim Myeong-jun can never abandon</i>

765
01:00:30,169 --> 01:00:31,962
Seo Hye-eun.
