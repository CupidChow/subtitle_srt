1
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,604
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS, GROUPS,

2
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,856
AND SETTINGS ARE FICTITIOUS,
AND CHILD SAFETY GUIDELINES WERE FOLLOWED

3
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:09,528
For a long time,

4
00:01:09,612 --> 00:01:12,198
X Capital invested in companies
with potential.

5
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:13,991
However,

6
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:17,036
this isn't about potential.
It's about changing the history.

7
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:18,913
How can we just let this chance go?

8
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:21,373
The desire to become a genius.

9
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,418
A point no one has ever reached.

10
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,922
X Capital will support everything.

11
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:34,887
You must be Ro-hee.

12
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:38,474
Hello.

13
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:48,943
Ro-hee.

14
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,528
Are you here to greet me?

15
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:54,990
Come here, let's go.

16
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,328
Come on.

17
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:17,471
Let go!

18
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,191
Ro-hee!

19
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:33,112
Ro-hee!

20
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:35,656
Ro-hee!

21
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:37,575
Let her go!

22
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:42,413
Ro-hee, are you okay? Look at me.

23
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:43,664
Are you okay?

24
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,214
How dare you touch her?

25
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:53,757
I'm sorry, ma'am.

26
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:55,718
Let's go.

27
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:05,436
Careful, Ro-hee.

28
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,938
It's been a while.

29
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:14,403
Well,

30
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,406
it's great to see you too.

31
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:35,841
Why did you leave?
What if you hurt yourself?

32
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:37,051
What if something happened--

33
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,470
Are you worried about me or your daughter?

34
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:40,512
Ro-hee.

35
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:44,683
From now on,

36
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,353
don't do anything like today.

37
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:50,522
We did all this for you.
You know that, right?

38
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,483
You're the hope of humankind.

39
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,653
Who decided that I have a duty
to become the hope of humankind?

40
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:57,947
Did God decide that?

41
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,989
Ro-hee.

42
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:01,283
If something happens to Mr. Kim,

43
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,411
I won't let it slide.

44
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:39,530
CHAPTER 6. THE NEGOTIATION

45
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:43,909
BASED ON THE NOVEL
THE DAY OF KIDNAPPING BY JEONG HAE-YEON

46
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:53,752
Gosh, everything is the same.

47
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:56,797
It's been a while.

48
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:08,600
Why did you come here yourself?

49
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,979
Why are you being so cold?

50
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,647
Am I not welcome here?

51
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:17,151
The investors of Dr. Choi's research

52
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:18,944
want to see results.

53
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:21,030
The research isn't finished yet.

54
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,282
But we have a product called Choi Ro-hee.

55
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,367
How can there be a product
when the research isn't complete?

56
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:27,745
Also,

57
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,538
Dr. Choi's research

58
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:32,166
was for early investors like me.

59
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,127
Ro-hee can't go anywhere

60
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,254
until the project is over.

61
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,258
You're smart, so I'm sure you know.

62
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,928
But who do you think
has the most shares in this project?

63
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,140
The investment was two billion, right?

64
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,642
There are five investors, including you.

65
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,269
So that's ten billion won.

66
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,982
That's why I came to Korea myself.

67
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,068
Withdraw your investment.

68
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:00,944
I'll make sure
you won't leave empty-handed.

69
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:02,321
You people...

70
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,532
only see this research as money.

71
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,451
That's right.

72
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,038
If it doesn't bring me money,
it's worthless.

73
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,124
Whether it's an adult or a child,

74
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,418
there's no reason for them to exist
if they're worthless.

75
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,475
Wow! This is crazy!

76
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:34,019
Look how much money this is!

77
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:35,938
-Hey.
-My goodness.

78
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,315
Stop acting suspiciously
and put the money back in.

79
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:41,276
We'll split the money evenly
when we arrive.

80
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,570
Split, my foot.

81
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,072
Goodness.

82
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,448
You sure this is safe?

83
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,700
I'm sure.

84
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:51,411
People who smuggle themselves
all bring dirty money.

85
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:54,331
No one would even care
if he died in the middle of the sea.

86
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,582
So don't worry.

87
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,667
What about the Chinese?

88
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,043
Don't worry.

89
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:01,380
Hey, give them a handful of it
when they come.

90
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:04,842
Then they'll take care of everything.

91
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,093
Okay?

92
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,679
Hey, after a round of poker...

93
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:13,225
Hey, they're coming. Hurry up and hide it.

94
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,560
Hide it!

95
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:32,452
Gosh, it's been a while brothers!

96
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,538
-Thank you.
-All right.

97
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,624
Who's coming with us?

98
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,919
Things didn't go as expected, so...

99
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,546
-What?
-Hold on.

100
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:43,964
Hey, bring it.

101
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:45,924
Hurry up.

102
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,261
Hurry up!

103
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:51,555
Here.

104
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,265
Please take care of this, okay?

105
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:54,641
What's this?

106
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:58,228
You all work hard, so you deserve
to drink, eat, and have some fun.

107
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,526
I guess you have no idea, do you?

108
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:05,861
Sorry?

109
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,447
That bag is ours.

110
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:11,909
They said the money is ours
if we take care of the man in the boat.

111
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,912
This is for taking care of him,
so here's your payment.

112
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,497
Give me that body and the bag.

113
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:21,335
Hey, mister.

114
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,712
What the hell are you talking about?

115
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:30,469
How dare you pull out your weapon,
you bastard?

116
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:36,183
If we don't get the bag,
we won't dispose of the body.

117
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:41,730
Turn the boat around!

118
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,149
We'll throw him in the sea.

119
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:48,528
Guys, come on out!

120
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,576
Damn it.

121
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:57,287
You can't go
if you don't give us the money.

122
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,628
Gosh, that hurts.

123
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,381
This is suffocating me.

124
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:14,805
What?

125
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,473
Get them!

126
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:24,940
What's going on?

127
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,657
-You!
-Move!

128
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,494
-My money!
-Hey, you!

129
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:46,837
Damn it.

130
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,719
Damn it!

131
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,351
Get him!

132
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,318
You bastard.

133
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,041
You bastard!

134
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,047
Die!

135
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:31,923
No!

136
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:34,468
I won't die!

137
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,142
I said let's go back!

138
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:25,894
Okay.

139
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,188
Let's go.

140
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:33,693
Really?

141
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:34,986
Yes, sir.

142
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:37,906
The kidnapper, Kim Myeong-jun,
is Seo Hye-eun's husband,

143
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:40,867
and Seo Hye-eun was adopted
by Choi Dong-eok

144
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,786
even before Choi Jin-tae.

145
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,039
You're saying Seo Hye-eun was involved

146
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,292
in the kidnapping and the murder?

147
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:52,671
It's a possibility.

148
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,718
Hey.

149
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:00,429
What?

150
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,056
Was it Kim Myeong-jun that called you?

151
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,059
No, it was another man.

152
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:10,272
He said he'd give me this money
if I helped Hee-ae's dad

153
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:12,399
see Hee-ae for one last time.

154
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,109
Last time?

155
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,987
I couldn't resist the money at first,
but looking at it,

156
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,155
I got too scared.

157
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,239
I'm so sorry.

158
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,783
Do you know where he went?

159
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:23,535
I'm not sure.

160
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:26,788
But...

161
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:28,874
it seemed like he was leaving for good.

162
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,209
He was saying his farewell to Hee-ae

163
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:32,878
like he wasn't going to come back.

164
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,592
They have the CCTV footage
from the parking lot.

165
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,594
-Find his route.
-Yes, sir.

166
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:43,930
Mr. Park.

167
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,558
-Hello.
-Did you have your morning coffee?

168
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,019
Yes, I did.

169
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:51,146
Right, I see.

170
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,193
Let's have coffee together next time.

171
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:57,527
Sure.

172
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,285
I've given it some thought.

173
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,330
Don't you think

174
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:11,333
this murder case
seems to be moving slowly?

175
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,001
I think...

176
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,295
that thing is the key.

177
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,893
What thing?

178
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:35,315
You have all the CCTV footage

179
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:37,317
of our hospital, right?

180
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,945
I probably have
the past three months' worth.

181
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:44,991
I think we should tell the police.

182
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:47,494
That lady...

183
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:48,662
Dr. Yoon.

184
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,545
About the meal
you mentioned the other day.

185
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:58,713
Yes?

186
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,174
How about dinner tonight?

187
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:02,509
Sure.

188
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:04,261
Sounds good.

189
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,027
Ro-hee, let's have breakfast.

190
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,242
Do kids prefer milk?

191
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:28,577
What about Mr. Kim?

192
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,079
I'm not sure.

193
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,456
He's probably in China by now.

194
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,583
Bring him.

195
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:35,667
Why should I?

196
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,960
Because I need him.

197
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,303
You two tried to escape, didn't you?

198
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,220
Why?

199
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,264
You want to live as a runaway forever?

200
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,600
Or were you guys planning
to go to the police?

201
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,352
He's the only person
I can trust right now.

202
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,106
I don't care if you find him in China
or the middle of the sea. Bring him.

203
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:59,149
What if I say no?

204
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,900
I won't go anywhere without him.

205
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,153
You think you have a choice?

206
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,031
Even if you take me to Singapore,

207
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,241
you can't prove that I'm a genius
without my help.

208
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,744
Can you give up all that money?

209
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:16,750
You're bargaining with me?

210
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:20,754
How interesting.

211
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:23,173
I like obedient kids.

212
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,219
I don't need a worthless genius.

213
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,639
And there's no reason

214
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,223
for a worthless kid to exist.

215
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:33,224
Watch your words.

216
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:34,851
What are you saying to a kid?

217
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:38,938
Then...

218
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,274
kill me.

219
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:47,280
They stuck needles in my body,
filled me up with drugs,

220
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:50,533
and stimulated my brain every day,
hoping to expand it.

221
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:54,913
I lied on the bed thinking
that I might die at the end of the day.

222
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,082
You think your blackmailing will work?

223
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,419
Just kill me.

224
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:12,013
Kim Myeong-jun came back alive.

225
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:19,688
This is interesting.

226
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,734
There's no need to bargain.

227
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,947
Bring that tough man back here.

228
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,061
-Hello.
-Hello.

229
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:02,731
I'm Detective Chae Jeong-man
from Youngin Police Station.

230
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,233
What brings you here?

231
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:08,194
Did all the boats
that went to work yesterday return?

232
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,196
Yes, they're all on their way back.

233
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:11,573
What's the matter?

234
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,658
Could we see the status board?

235
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:16,453
-Yes, come this way.
-Okay.

236
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:39,517
Taxi!

237
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,394
Kim Myeong-jun!

238
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:50,779
Damn it!

239
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,823
-Chang-hun, go the other way!
-Got it!

240
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:04,918
Damn it.

241
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,509
Hey, stop right there!

242
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:13,718
Hey!

243
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,979
Damn it.

244
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:28,566
Stop!

245
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,326
Mr. Kim Myeong-jun.

246
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:42,789
Stop with this nonsense and give up.

247
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:50,713
Give me your hands.

248
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:28,960
I'm Park Sang-yun.

249
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,421
We met in Seoul, right?

250
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:38,219
Why did you get on a boat?
Did you try to smuggle yourself?

251
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:39,888
Damn it.

252
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,056
Put your head up.

253
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,726
You don't deserve to put your head down.

254
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:48,605
Why are you alone?

255
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:50,398
Where's Choi Ro-hee?

256
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,069
Please help me.

257
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,158
What do you mean?

258
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,247
Tell us everything so we can help.

259
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,418
Ro-hee was there that day.

260
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,920
Sorry?

261
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,589
The day when Ro-hee's parents
got murdered.

262
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:18,092
When Ro-hee came out of the house,
there was a car in the front.

263
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:19,844
She thought it was a police car at first,

264
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:22,472
so she thought someone in the police
was the culprit.

265
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:26,684
But she remembered
that the siren lights were yellow.

266
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,479
Yellow?

267
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,315
-The security company?
-That's right.

268
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:36,694
Are you saying she witnessed everything?

269
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:39,113
Yes, but as she was coming out
of the alley,

270
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:40,490
she collapsed.

271
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,784
And she hit her head hard on the ground,

272
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:45,203
so she couldn't even remember
who she was for a while.

273
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,080
And things happened,

274
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,957
so she ended up going to her dad's villa.

275
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:51,834
That's when she remembered
what happened that day.

276
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,378
She even remembered

277
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:55,463
seeing the security company employee
in the living room.

278
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,008
So we tried to run away from the villa,

279
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:01,135
but they told me
to get on a boat to China.

280
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:04,263
Then they started
fighting each other and all.

281
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:05,723
Hold on.

282
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:09,060
Where's that villa? Where is Choi Ro-hee?

283
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:11,104
Right, that villa is...

284
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,773
Three hundred...

285
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:15,400
Three hundred...

286
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,861
Gosh, I forgot! I'm so dumb!

287
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:20,822
Three hundred?

288
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,699
Yes, it's the highway number.

289
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,409
It was 300...

290
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:26,911
Three hundred...

291
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:30,832
Three hundred...

292
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,583
NATIONAL HIGHWAY
391

293
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,796
I remember.

294
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:38,256
It was 391!

295
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:00,088
Who are you?

296
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:02,173
Tell me.

297
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,133
Who the hell are you?!

298
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:06,636
Damn it.

299
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:42,588
Stop it.

300
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:11,325
Let's go to Ro-hee.

301
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,032
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

302
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,661
What's this all of a sudden?

303
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:57,580
I want to take some time off.

304
00:24:58,122 --> 00:24:59,248
I'm exhausted.

305
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,376
Is it because of the incident?

306
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,669
It's part of the reason.

307
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:06,464
It feels like

308
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:09,383
everything and everyone
is telling me to quit.

309
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:14,764
I'm not going to process this,

310
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,224
so come back after some rest, okay?

311
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:19,435
Go somewhere and get some air too.

312
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:21,312
It's fine.

313
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:23,898
You don't need to.

314
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:27,109
Where else would I find someone like you?

315
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,569
I can't let you go like this.

316
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,448
Take a few days off
and go somewhere nice, okay?

317
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:34,659
I need my severance pay.

318
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:37,912
Severance pay?

319
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:41,499
Please process my resignation.

320
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:45,878
Mr. Park...

321
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:50,109
You can't move right now.

322
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:51,652
You have to lie down.

323
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,112
It's okay.

324
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:55,406
You're not okay.

325
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:57,575
Jeez.

326
00:26:57,825 --> 00:27:00,911
The van got completely smashed.

327
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:06,042
Get some rest.

328
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:10,254
I'll try to clean up this mess.

329
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:13,799
Choi Ro-hee saw Park Cheol-won
on the day of the incident.

330
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,426
The CCTV guy?

331
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:16,886
Yes, we...

332
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,473
We need to question him.

333
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:21,557
Goodness.

334
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:23,893
You want to trust a kidnapper's words?

335
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:26,228
Kim Myeong-jun requested our help,

336
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:27,730
saying that he was on his way
to meet Choi Ro-hee.

337
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:28,898
Listen.

338
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:31,233
Think about it.

339
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:34,111
A kidnapper tried to smuggle himself
out of the country.

340
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:37,239
Then do you think that kid is alive?

341
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:42,078
He was just spewing nonsense
because he got arrested.

342
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,497
You saw the CCTV footage.
They seemed close.

343
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,874
Kim Myeong-jun is also a dad.

344
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:49,251
He must be really good with kids.

345
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:52,755
He had no one to negotiate for money

346
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,715
and time was passing,

347
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,217
so he...

348
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,220
probably did the worst.

349
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:00,971
He didn't seem like the type to do that.

350
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:03,766
I just know it.

351
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:14,819
Goodbye.

352
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:21,117
The reservation is under Yoon Jeong-do.

353
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,785
Let me check, sir.

354
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:37,258
Oh, Mr. Park, you're here.

355
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:38,968
Come on in.

356
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,972
Gosh, the raw fish here is great.

357
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:50,020
This is Lee Chang-hun.

358
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:52,648
Sorry?

359
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,734
Okay. We'll be right there.

360
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:56,944
Okay.

361
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:59,280
Ju-hyeok, turn the car around.

362
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,823
Why? What is it?

363
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,659
Park Cheol-won caused trouble.

364
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,035
What?

365
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:17,339
Excuse me.

366
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:18,382
We're the police.

367
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,308
-Drop the knife!
-Mr. Park, why are you doing this?

368
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:28,434
Drop the knife!

369
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:29,643
Hurry up and drop it!

370
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:33,939
-Jeez.
-Mr. Park Cheol-won.

371
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:35,357
Save me.

372
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,652
-Please save me.
-Drop the knife.

373
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:41,947
Hurry and drop the knife.

374
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:52,833
Drop the knife.

375
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:02,092
I'll count to three.

376
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,303
Don't try anything.

377
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:05,930
One,

378
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:08,182
two,

379
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:13,062
three...

380
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:26,575
Call the medical team!

381
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:28,077
Ju-hyeok, catch him!

382
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:49,515
Mr. Yoon Jeong-do!

383
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:51,642
Mr. Yoon Jeong-do!

384
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:00,109
Why did you murder him?

385
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:03,070
Did you also murder Dr. Choi and his wife?

386
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:04,738
Why did you do it?

387
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:07,032
Can you please explain what happened?

388
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:09,618
-What's going on?
-What's happening?

389
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:12,371
-Goodness.
-What's going on?

390
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,290
What on earth is going on?

391
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:15,457
Goodness.

392
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,876
He isn't the type to do that.

393
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,258
Did he really live here?

394
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:26,969
Was he going to move or what?

395
00:31:58,751 --> 00:31:59,752
Sir.

396
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:01,837
Take a look.

397
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:04,882
Send this to forensics

398
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:07,134
and collect Park Cheol-won's clothes here.

399
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:08,636
Yes, sir.

400
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:16,393
This incident shocked
the citizens of Youngin.

401
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:19,396
The suspect of the
Youngin Hospital Director Murder Case

402
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,023
has been arrested.

403
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:24,818
The suspect, Park,
went to a Japanese restaurant

404
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:29,031
and murdered Yoon,
a co-worker of Dr. Choi.

405
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,992
A restaurant worker called in the report,
and he was arrested at the scene.

406
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,286
Ro-hee.

407
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:36,580
Are you okay?

408
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,292
Are you really asking me if I'm okay

409
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,920
when you're the one who clearly isn't?

410
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,424
I was worried.

411
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:50,135
What a relief.

412
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:51,887
I thought I'd never see you again.

413
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:55,224
You met the cops, didn't you?

414
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:57,518
How did you know?

415
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:00,187
They arrested the culprit.

416
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:04,900
Park, the suspect, shocked the world
by his brutal murder method.

417
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,777
The police said they'll investigate

418
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,862
the details of the incident
as soon as possible.

419
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:10,239
-Are you okay?
-Park was arrested

420
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:13,075
without any resistance at the scene...

421
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,792
Look at your face.
You must've gotten beaten up good.

422
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:25,796
Can you even protect me
when you're this weak?

423
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:29,091
Hey! An ordinary man
would've died already.

424
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:30,342
Jeez.

425
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:33,887
You can't be an ordinary man.

426
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:37,141
Don't worry.

427
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:40,769
I'll survive until everything is over.

428
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:43,939
Stop pretending to be cool.

429
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:49,361
There will be a weird man downstairs.

430
00:33:50,154 --> 00:33:52,072
I know you'll want to beat him up,

431
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,533
but try to hold back.

432
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:55,784
What?

433
00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:58,078
By the way...

434
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,457
were you worried about me?

435
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:03,208
You waited until I was awake.

436
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:04,293
I mean,

437
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:07,463
if you want to interpret it that way,
then go ahead.

438
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:10,799
Oh, also,

439
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:12,760
good job.

440
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:14,219
What do you mean?

441
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,096
You survived an unexpected event.

442
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,454
Congratulations, tough man!

443
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:42,831
Take a seat. You should eat.

444
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,876
You should eat well
with all that blood you lost.

445
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:47,336
Take a seat.

446
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:50,130
Who are you?

447
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,800
Oh, do I have to introduce myself?

448
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,637
My name is Jaden.

449
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:58,889
Think of me as a money man

450
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:00,933
who's investing huge amounts into Ro-hee.

451
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,644
-And you?
-This won't do.

452
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,271
-Don't hold back.
-What?

453
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:08,607
In hindsight,
there's no reason to hold back.

454
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,109
He tried to kill you twice.

455
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:13,570
Right.

456
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,241
But still, I shouldn't.

457
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:19,993
I'm Kim Myeong-jun.

458
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:23,664
You bastard!

459
00:35:23,831 --> 00:35:25,415
So it was you, you bastard.

460
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:31,505
Damn it.

461
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,384
He's a monster.

462
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,345
He might destroy this villa.

463
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:48,063
Are we even now?

464
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:52,693
Depends.

465
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,863
Okay.

466
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:58,907
I brought him back as you wish,

467
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:00,993
so let's talk business.

468
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,416
What are you staring at?

469
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:14,172
Good job.

470
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,925
How dare that bastard mess with me.

471
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:24,182
Is this the only bottle of virus left?

472
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,769
Currently, that bottle

473
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:30,022
is the only one Dr. Choi left.

474
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,276
We analyzed its substance,

475
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:38,155
but it's a genetic blueprint
that's comprised of sensitive viruses.

476
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,283
So it's hard to identify
the exact substances of the drug.

477
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:44,912
If we don't find his virus chart,

478
00:36:45,913 --> 00:36:47,623
we can't reproduce this drug.

479
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,666
Isn't it your job

480
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,877
to find out such things?

481
00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:57,466
You've lost your worth.

482
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:01,553
Why?

483
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:03,597
Are you going to kill me too?

484
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,849
What are you saying?

485
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:09,519
A human life shouldn't be taken lightly.
I can't kill someone on a whim.

486
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:10,520
Then what about me?

487
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,940
-Is my life worthless?
-Stop it.

488
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:16,985
Gosh, you startled me.

489
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:21,114
Don't you know how this is made?

490
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:23,408
You think I have
supernatural powers or something?

491
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:27,204
Don't you think your dad
would have records of this somewhere?

492
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,125
All the records were handwritten
since my grandpa's time,

493
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:34,544
so it should be somewhere in the house.

494
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:37,547
Then we should go inside that house.

495
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:43,261
In agriculture,

496
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:45,639
good fertilizer isn't the only thing
that makes crops grow.

497
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:48,058
The brain stimulation drugs
and genetic blueprint used

498
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:50,894
from the moment you were born until now.

499
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:55,857
That subcloning map
is the genius child creation manual.

500
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,030
Goodbye then.

501
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,199
I'm off to find this manual.

502
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:17,254
CHAIRMAN PARK GI-SUN

503
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:19,840
HAS JADEN ARRIVED?

504
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:31,601
YOUNGIN HOSPITAL
DIRECTOR AND WIFE MURDER CASE

505
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:35,063
NO INTERNET

506
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:40,652
This is annoying.

507
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:43,447
What's wrong?

508
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:45,532
Jaden cut off the Internet.

509
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,451
He did?

510
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:50,579
Go to bed.

511
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:53,040
I'm asking this just in case,

512
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,876
but you don't know
the security company worker

513
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:57,419
we saw on the news today, do you?

514
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,631
Not at all.

515
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:04,634
I don't know anyone
who works for a security company.

516
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:05,927
What about your wife?

517
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:08,013
She's the one who told you to kidnap me.

518
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:10,515
And it had to be on that day.

519
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:13,852
Tell me about it.

520
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:18,774
I have no idea
what kind of person Hye-eun is anymore.

521
00:39:21,151 --> 00:39:22,903
This isn't a simple matter.

522
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:25,697
On the 21st,

523
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:28,283
you were planning
to break into my house to kidnap me.

524
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:30,744
If you had broken into my house,

525
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:32,454
you would've seen the murderer.

526
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:42,672
By the way...

527
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,342
what kind of person was your dad?

528
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:49,387
Why did he kill your dad?

529
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,141
How would I know?

530
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:59,231
I've talked with you a lot more
in the past few days

531
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:01,983
than I ever did with my dad.

532
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:07,197
I have no idea what my dad is like.

533
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:10,909
I guess we're similar.

534
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,389
It's time to lock the doors. Come in.

535
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:41,064
-You want some beer?
-I don't drink.

536
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:44,151
You look like a heavy drinker.

537
00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:47,195
Then just come hold a beer.

538
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:48,780
I could use some company.

539
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:55,996
I don't believe we're that close, are we?

540
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:57,706
That's true.

541
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:01,668
You try to kill me,
then save me when I'm about to die.

542
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,004
Then you try to kill me again.

543
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:07,132
When are you going to try
killing me again?

544
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:10,177
I guess this isn't your fault.

545
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,429
It's not like you have
hard feelings toward me.

546
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:13,680
You're just following orders.

547
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:17,851
Are you also a money man?

548
00:41:18,852 --> 00:41:19,978
You make a lot?

549
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:21,646
You have a girlfriend?

550
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:25,817
Don't tell me...

551
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:29,154
you've never
been in a relationship before.

552
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:30,906
Wait.

553
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,742
Jeez, fine. I was just joking.

554
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:35,994
What are you, a robot?

555
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:39,664
Listen.

556
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,251
When someone remembers another person,

557
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:47,047
a single moment decides
what kind of person they are.

558
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:49,549
I have that moment with you,

559
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:51,343
apart from all the fighting.

560
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:55,347
It's when you helped me

561
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:57,807
meet Hee-ae.

562
00:41:58,433 --> 00:41:59,434
I'm truly...

563
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:01,394
thankful for that.

564
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:04,314
As for everything else, I'm not.

565
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:06,566
It's what Dr. Mo Eun-sun did for you.

566
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,944
Of course, I'm thankful to her too.

567
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:21,498
Weren't you trying to run away
with Ro-hee?

568
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,751
So why did you go
to see your child that day?

569
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,129
Was it to fool everyone?

570
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:33,134
I'm not that clever.

571
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:35,095
I just thought...

572
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:37,722
things might go wrong.

573
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:41,226
Then I may not see her ever again.

574
00:42:42,102 --> 00:42:43,645
Hee-ae is my everything.

575
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,483
But looking back,

576
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,903
it was a good decision to see her.

577
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:56,324
One more thing.

578
00:42:57,867 --> 00:43:01,121
We adults are all worn out.

579
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:04,499
But Ro-hee is still a kid.

580
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:06,960
She's a poor kid

581
00:43:08,128 --> 00:43:10,922
who wants to cry and complain

582
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:13,383
but holds her emotions.

583
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:19,514
We should protect kids, shouldn't we?

584
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:39,034
Mr. Park Cheol-won.

585
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:44,080
Before we talk about Dr. Yoon Jeong-do,
I have something to ask.

586
00:43:45,582 --> 00:43:46,875
We found a sneaker in your house

587
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:50,378
that had Dr. Choi Jin-tae's blood on it.

588
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,965
And on the day of the incident,

589
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,593
his child witnessed something.

590
00:43:57,802 --> 00:44:00,180
A security company car
in front of the house,

591
00:44:01,056 --> 00:44:02,557
and you in the living room.

592
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:07,145
Were you...

593
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:09,898
at Dr. Choi's house that day?

594
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:15,862
Yes.

595
00:44:19,616 --> 00:44:20,742
Did you murder...

596
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:23,119
Dr. Choi?

597
00:44:27,207 --> 00:44:28,124
Yes.

598
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:31,169
I killed him.

599
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:38,134
On the day I was disabling the CCTV,

600
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:42,180
I saw a safe in a room.

601
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:49,062
Now that the CCTVs were gone,

602
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:51,064
I got greedy.

603
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:55,944
I checked their movements every day
through the CCTVs.

604
00:44:56,653 --> 00:44:57,904
My plan was to break in,

605
00:44:58,613 --> 00:44:59,948
take the gold bars and money,

606
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:02,534
and leave while they were asleep.

607
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:05,495
What about the passcode?

608
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:09,207
I memorized the passcode
of the house and safe

609
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:10,917
by watching the CCTV footage.

610
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:14,838
But there was no money.

611
00:45:15,255 --> 00:45:17,132
I only found strange documents.

612
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,847
I had no choice but to go home.

613
00:45:27,434 --> 00:45:29,227
That's when Dr. Choi came up
from the basement.

614
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:30,437
What are you doing here?

615
00:45:32,147 --> 00:45:34,274
What the hell are you doing, you bastard?

616
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:36,151
He suddenly attacked me.

617
00:45:37,152 --> 00:45:38,653
I was flustered.

618
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,281
Die, you bastard!

619
00:45:42,574 --> 00:45:45,076
Did you also kill his wife, Ms. So Jin-yu?

620
00:45:45,452 --> 00:45:46,369
No.

621
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:51,583
You bastard.

622
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:53,668
During our fight,

623
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:56,546
I saw something

624
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:59,132
-Die, you bastard.
-at the corner of his bed.

625
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:00,091
Die!

626
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:03,845
Die, you bastard!

627
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:07,265
Ms. So was already dead.

628
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:21,404
Can you explain how you murdered Dr. Choi?

629
00:46:21,905 --> 00:46:23,114
Dr. Choi...

630
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:26,159
was stronger than he looked.

631
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:49,182
Mr. Park, you should've told me
if you needed money.

632
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:52,101
Did you think of robbing our money
since the CCTVs are gone now?

633
00:46:52,185 --> 00:46:53,394
No, Dr. Choi.

634
00:46:57,649 --> 00:46:59,776
Why? Are you going to stab me with that?

635
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:01,027
This is great.

636
00:47:01,903 --> 00:47:04,822
You killed my wife with that sword,

637
00:47:04,906 --> 00:47:06,157
and I killed you in self-defense.

638
00:47:06,658 --> 00:47:07,700
How does that sound?

639
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:08,826
Great, right?

640
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:10,662
Go ahead.

641
00:47:17,544 --> 00:47:19,170
Look at you.

642
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:21,798
Go ahead.

643
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:26,386
You've never stabbed someone before,
have you?

644
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:27,637
Stab me. I'll stand still.

645
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:29,097
Hurry up.

646
00:47:29,806 --> 00:47:30,848
Go ahead.

647
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:33,726
Go ahead, Mr. Park.

648
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:39,315
Stab me, you bastard--

649
00:48:08,428 --> 00:48:09,470
Dr. Choi.

650
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:14,601
Were you simply after Dr. Choi's money?

651
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:17,687
Are you sure this has nothing to do
with the incident 30 years ago?

652
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:20,064
It was a coincidence that we met.

653
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:22,525
If I wanted revenge,

654
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,236
I would've killed his father,
Dr. Choi Dong-eok,

655
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,113
30 years ago.

656
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:32,285
Then why did you kill Yoon Jeong-do?

657
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:35,872
My wife and child...

658
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:39,334
didn't die
from a mere medical malpractice.

659
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:43,796
It was one caused by an unlicensed doctor.

660
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:45,298
What does that...

661
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:47,884
have to do with Yoon Jeong-do?

662
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:49,636
Do you think...

663
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:52,847
Yoon Jeong-do is a doctor?

664
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,184
Good work.

665
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:58,227
-Good work.
-Good work.

666
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:03,650
When I found out
that he was an unlicensed doctor,

667
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,945
and as I watched him
walk out of the operating room,

668
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:12,325
I just couldn't forgive him.

669
00:49:13,076 --> 00:49:14,077
You murdered him

670
00:49:15,203 --> 00:49:16,996
just because of that?

671
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:21,626
I didn't want something like that
to happen again.

672
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,261
You know Ms. Seo Hye-eun well, right?

673
00:49:34,764 --> 00:49:36,224
Is she involved in this incident?

674
00:49:38,226 --> 00:49:40,186
Her husband, Kim Myeong-jun,

675
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:44,357
kidnapped Dr. Choi's daughter on the 21st.

676
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:47,402
The kid was running as if she was escaping

677
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,362
when she was kidnapped.

678
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,243
I don't know of that matter.

679
00:49:56,786 --> 00:49:59,247
I saw on the news
that the kidnapper's child is sick.

680
00:50:00,248 --> 00:50:01,749
It wouldn't be strange

681
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:05,253
if he was attempting
to coax money from Dr. Choi,

682
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:07,463
the richest man in Youngin.

683
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:23,479
What's the name again?

684
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:26,399
Choi Dong-jun, Ro-hee's great-uncle.

685
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:29,402
-Great-uncle?
-Yes, sir.

686
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:31,779
He's the chairman of EI Construction,

687
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:35,533
and the next in line to inherit
Dr. Choi's assets after Choi Ro-hee.

688
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:39,704
The law firm in charge
is processing the inheritance.

689
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:43,416
Gosh, these heartless people.

690
00:50:46,294 --> 00:50:47,587
What an interesting family.

691
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:57,597
Are you saying you know
where Ro-hee is or not?

692
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:01,434
I don't think that's the issue here.

693
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:07,607
Isn't what you're after
Dr. Choi Jin-tae's assets?

694
00:51:08,357 --> 00:51:09,650
How dare you?

695
00:51:10,735 --> 00:51:13,404
Stop playing games and be honest.

696
00:51:13,613 --> 00:51:14,739
I'm short on time.

697
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:19,827
It's not his assets to be precise.

698
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:22,663
It's my brother,
Choi Dong-eok's inheritance.

699
00:51:23,915 --> 00:51:25,124
Jin-tae was adopted.

700
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:29,796
It doesn't make sense
for him to inherit my brother's assets.

701
00:51:30,338 --> 00:51:32,507
On top of that,
it's going to his 11-year-old daughter.

702
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:33,841
How can I sit back and watch?

703
00:51:35,051 --> 00:51:38,054
I looked into it, and including
real estate, shares, bonds, and savings,

704
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:40,807
his assets amount to
about 120 billion won.

705
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:42,058
You're fast.

706
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:47,313
They say money attracts all types of bugs.

707
00:51:49,482 --> 00:51:50,608
Who are you?

708
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,653
Choi Ro-hee has to die,

709
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:55,488
I mean, she has to be declared dead

710
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:57,657
to legally inherit his assets.

711
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:58,825
I asked who you are.

712
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,245
Don't worry.

713
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:04,831
I'm not interested in the 120 billion won.

714
00:52:06,374 --> 00:52:08,000
Then what is it that you want?

715
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,280
We're not open today.

716
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:38,406
Please leave.

717
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:43,786
Damn it.

718
00:52:46,706 --> 00:52:48,124
I said we're not open today.

719
00:52:48,541 --> 00:52:49,792
What the hell?

720
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:51,586
-I said we're closed.
-What the hell?

721
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:54,338
You hear me? Leave.

722
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:56,048
I said leave.

723
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:02,972
-Hey.
-What's going on?

724
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:04,390
-Hey, watch it.
-Where are you going?

725
00:53:08,144 --> 00:53:09,395
Damn it.

726
00:53:16,027 --> 00:53:17,987
Just do as we told you.

727
00:53:18,988 --> 00:53:21,616
You drove the ship,
but you didn't see the man's face.

728
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:23,951
You saw something being tossed
into the sea,

729
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:26,287
but you're not sure if it's a body or not.

730
00:53:26,913 --> 00:53:28,289
If you stick to this,

731
00:53:28,873 --> 00:53:31,000
our legal team will do our best
to take care of the rest.

VIOLENT CRIMES TEAM 1

734
00:53:44,931 --> 00:53:46,265
Good work, sir.

735
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:48,601
It's nothing.

736
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:51,520
We're not even halfway done.

737
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:53,314
Right, what about Ms. Seo Hye-eun?

738
00:53:53,648 --> 00:53:56,150
She's not showing up,
and we still can't reach her.

739
00:53:57,944 --> 00:53:59,236
You want some coffee?

740
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:00,279
Sure.

741
00:54:00,363 --> 00:54:01,530
-Coffee?
-I want iced coffee.

742
00:54:01,614 --> 00:54:03,074
Gosh, he's a handful.

743
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:04,533
Sir!

744
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:06,953
Take a look at this.

745
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:15,753
-What's this?
-What?

746
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:18,506
YOUNGIN KIDNAPPING CASE
CHILD ENDS UP TOSSED IN THE SEA

747
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:20,049
Where did you toss the body?

748
00:54:20,132 --> 00:54:21,592
Please move.

749
00:54:21,676 --> 00:54:24,387
Choi Ro-hee, the survivor of the
Youngin Hospital Director Murder Case

750
00:54:24,512 --> 00:54:26,180
and the kidnap victim,

751
00:54:26,514 --> 00:54:28,057
has been...

752
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,809
I threw the body into the sea?

753
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:31,310
You?

754
00:54:31,894 --> 00:54:32,979
Have they lost their minds?

755
00:54:33,354 --> 00:54:34,981
How does it feel to be with a ghost?

756
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:37,858
You think this is funny?

757
00:54:38,067 --> 00:54:39,110
Should I be sad then?

758
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:41,445
Think about why they made that move.

759
00:54:41,696 --> 00:54:42,822
Why did they?

760
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:45,866
Well...

761
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:50,079
Who will be the happiest if I die?

762
00:54:51,414 --> 00:54:52,456
Happiest?

763
00:54:57,003 --> 00:54:58,129
Funeral home companies?

764
00:55:00,381 --> 00:55:01,632
How lame.

765
00:55:02,717 --> 00:55:04,927
When did your intelligence
stop developing?

766
00:55:08,431 --> 00:55:09,557
Man, that's funny.

767
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:14,020
Come here.

768
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:16,939
-Why?
-Just come.

769
00:55:17,023 --> 00:55:18,232
What is it again?

770
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,358
Come.

771
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:20,985
Seriously.

772
00:55:27,116 --> 00:55:29,702
Go tell Dr. Mo Eun-sun for ointment.

773
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:31,287
Don't say anything other than that.

774
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:35,082
You always ask me to do stuff like this.

775
00:55:40,379 --> 00:55:41,505
Excuse me, Dr. Mo.

776
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:44,383
I've prepared some dinner for Ro-hee.

777
00:55:45,134 --> 00:55:48,345
I know she doesn't want to eat,
but you have to force her.

778
00:55:49,889 --> 00:55:51,557
She'll listen to you.

779
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:53,309
Okay.

780
00:55:56,187 --> 00:56:00,066
We're out of disinfectant for wounds.

781
00:56:00,149 --> 00:56:01,442
Could I get some more?

782
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:05,654
Wait here.

783
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:18,334
DRAW A PATTERN TO UNLOCK YOUR PHONE

784
00:56:26,092 --> 00:56:27,301
You're a genius.

785
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:28,636
It's nothing new.

786
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:29,929
Be on the lookout.

787
00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:31,055
Okay.

788
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:35,518
VICTIM'S FAMILY: PLEASE DO YOUR BEST
TO FIND THE KIDNAPPER

789
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:37,436
SUSPECT ADMITTED TO AIDING
THE DISPOSAL OF THE BODY...

790
00:56:38,354 --> 00:56:39,688
In summary,

791
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:43,776
Jaden bribed the captain
and made it look like I'm dead.

792
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:47,947
He tried to use my relatives
to get into my dad's house.

793
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:49,615
Why would he do that?

794
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:51,033
The next inheritor in line

795
00:56:51,117 --> 00:56:54,328
will receive my dad's inheritance
if I'm declared dead.

796
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,330
But still, you're their family.

797
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,707
They're family
I haven't even seen once in my life.

798
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:00,709
They wouldn't hesitate to do this.

799
00:57:00,793 --> 00:57:02,920
THE RELATIVES ARE DEVASTATED

800
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:10,594
Hey!

801
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:16,267
Are you okay?

802
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,519
Yes.

803
00:57:31,282 --> 00:57:32,616
When did you come back here?

804
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:35,077
Mr. Kidnapper.

805
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:39,123
What?

806
00:57:39,582 --> 00:57:40,791
Why are you calling me like that again?

807
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:43,752
There's one thing you forgot to do
as a kidnapper.

808
00:57:47,173 --> 00:57:48,090
What is it?

809
00:57:55,431 --> 00:57:58,309
RESTRICTED NUMBER

810
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:01,729
Hello?

811
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:03,230
This is Kim Myeong-jun.

812
00:58:05,357 --> 00:58:06,775
Mr. Kim Myeong-jun?

813
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:08,277
I'm the kidnapper.

814
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:09,612
I have...

815
00:58:10,446 --> 00:58:11,780
Ro-hee.

816
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:16,577
Please go on.

817
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:18,704
I'm calling to negotiate.

818
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:20,789
Negotiate?

819
00:58:23,209 --> 00:58:24,543
Are you with her right now?

820
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:27,838
If you want to find her,

821
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:30,049
you'll need to prepare some money.

822
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:36,013
Thirty billion won.

823
00:59:22,101 --> 00:59:23,602
Is he trustworthy? Who is he?

824
00:59:23,686 --> 00:59:25,104
It's been a while, Mr. Choi.

825
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:27,064
The kidnapper called you himself?

826
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:30,776
Demanding 30 billion won
for an 11-year-old girl?

827
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:33,028
You have until midnight tomorrow.

828
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:35,823
What will you do if things go wrong?

829
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:37,783
I'll bring Choi Ro-hee's body to you.

830
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:38,909
It's strange

831
00:59:38,993 --> 00:59:40,577
that the security company worker

832
00:59:40,703 --> 00:59:42,579
and your wife are acquainted.

833
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:43,998
Ms. Seo Hye-eun is here.

834
00:59:44,373 --> 00:59:46,041
Where do you want me to begin?

835
00:59:46,125 --> 00:59:47,084
Why are you handing over the case?

836
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:50,379
Kim Myeong-jun threw Choi Ro-hee
into the sea.

837
00:59:50,462 --> 00:59:53,090
Capture that kidnapper at all costs.

838
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:56,010
Don't you dare touch Hye-eun.
I won't let it slide.

839
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:58,679
I think Kim Myeong-jun is being used.

840
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:00,806
I should've asked this sooner.

841
01:00:01,015 --> 01:00:02,057
Who are you?

842
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:04,518
