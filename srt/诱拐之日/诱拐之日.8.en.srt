00:00:56,601 --> 00:01:00,036
THE KIDNAPPING DAY

2
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,663
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS, GROUPS,

3
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:04,023
AND SETTINGS ARE FICTITIOUS,
AND CHILD SAFETY GUIDELINES WERE FOLLOWED

4
00:01:04,047 --> 00:01:05,537
THIS PROGRAM IS FUNDED
BY THE COMMUNICATIONS

5
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:07,021
DEVELOPMENT FUND
OF MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND ICT

6
00:01:21,127 --> 00:01:22,428
I'm a cop.

7
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:29,185
Did you not hear?

8
00:01:29,261 --> 00:01:31,312
I'm a cop. Drop your weapon!

9
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:36,442
Stop right there, you rat!

10
00:01:52,993 --> 00:01:54,878
I just fired two blanks.

11
00:01:55,036 --> 00:01:56,588
The next one is a real bullet.

12
00:01:57,455 --> 00:01:59,048
Drop your weapons.

13
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:05,847
Put your hands behind your head
and lean against the car.

14
00:02:15,932 --> 00:02:17,525
Where's Choi Ro-hee?

15
00:02:19,352 --> 00:02:22,280
You bastard, are you upset or what?

16
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:24,073
Stop staring!

17
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:27,619
Tell us what you know...

18
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:29,871
at the station.

19
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:39,339
Damn it.

20
00:02:39,623 --> 00:02:42,508
I found you, you mole.

21
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:46,221
Get out.

22
00:02:57,515 --> 00:02:59,484
I knew something was off.

23
00:02:59,768 --> 00:03:02,330
A kidnapper calls a rookie attorney

24
00:03:02,354 --> 00:03:03,915
who's a contract employee?

25
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:06,834
I know you knew Ro-hee in the past,
but it's too out of the blue.

26
00:03:06,858 --> 00:03:08,711
After all, I have Ro-hee.

27
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:11,422
I knew you would've gotten help.

28
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:12,914
So I was certain

29
00:03:13,823 --> 00:03:15,458
that there was a mole.

30
00:03:18,703 --> 00:03:20,713
A woman with a calm voice.

31
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,593
I knew it sounded familiar.

32
00:03:27,504 --> 00:03:30,181
Why didn't I suspect you first?

33
00:03:31,925 --> 00:03:34,727
All right. It's my fault.

34
00:03:37,764 --> 00:03:40,525
Since you have to find out

35
00:03:40,642 --> 00:03:44,205
the drug that Choi Ro-hee was constantly
injected with and the virus chart,

36
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:46,155
I'll keep you alive for the time being.

37
00:03:48,024 --> 00:03:49,784
Tell me why you should live.

38
00:03:51,987 --> 00:03:53,413
Time is ticking.

39
00:03:58,785 --> 00:04:01,045
-Damn.
-You missed.

40
00:04:01,162 --> 00:04:03,724
You said you were good at shooting.

41
00:04:03,748 --> 00:04:06,227
-Of course, in a game.
-Are you...

42
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:08,145
-What...
-Then you shoot!

43
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:10,013
Are you telling a kid to use a gun?

44
00:04:10,743 --> 00:04:11,743
Damn!

45
00:04:12,424 --> 00:04:13,901
Drop the gun, Jackson.

46
00:04:13,925 --> 00:04:15,152
It's "Jaden."

47
00:04:15,176 --> 00:04:17,395
-Right, Jason.
-It's "Jaden"!

48
00:04:18,054 --> 00:04:19,397
It's Jaden?

49
00:04:19,472 --> 00:04:20,982
What a confusing name.

50
00:04:21,182 --> 00:04:22,952
Both of us are pointing guns

51
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:24,527
and you're telling me to drop it?

52
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,446
That's why I brought this.

53
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:31,826
Hey, it's dangerous. Give it to them!

54
00:04:39,242 --> 00:04:40,636
Can't win now, can you?

55
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,878
Drop the gun.

56
00:04:50,378 --> 00:04:51,679
Dr. Mo.

57
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:59,062
All right, it's your turn to talk.

58
00:04:59,304 --> 00:05:01,022
Why should we let you live?

59
00:05:05,935 --> 00:05:07,236
Nothing to say, right?

60
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,864
You think human lives
are worthless, don't you?

61
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,867
Tomorrow morning,

62
00:05:13,443 --> 00:05:15,588
you'll go to the police station with us.

63
00:05:15,612 --> 00:05:17,214
We should pay for what we've done.

64
00:05:17,238 --> 00:05:19,665
You and I both.

65
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,887
I don't know what you want,

66
00:05:22,911 --> 00:05:24,587
but you better give up.

67
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:26,640
From this moment on,

68
00:05:26,664 --> 00:05:31,344
Ro-hee isn't a subject
of an experiment anymore.

69
00:05:35,548 --> 00:05:37,392
How idealistic.

70
00:05:37,801 --> 00:05:39,102
Goodness.

71
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,689
Do you know how much Dr. Choi Jin-tae
received for this experiment?

72
00:05:44,057 --> 00:05:46,859
How much money do you think
has been invested until now?

73
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,736
I told you, didn't I?

74
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:51,656
That money is the most violent and harsh.

75
00:05:52,816 --> 00:05:55,576
You think getting rid of me
will be the end of this?

76
00:05:58,238 --> 00:05:59,455
Yes!

77
00:05:59,864 --> 00:06:01,207
I'm going to end this.

78
00:06:02,158 --> 00:06:05,962
Ro-hee will live
as an ordinary 11-year-old girl.

79
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:10,216
That's the only thing I can do
as her kidnapper.

80
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:14,303
You...

81
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,931
What was it?

82
00:06:17,215 --> 00:06:18,474
JJ.

83
00:06:19,634 --> 00:06:21,352
What was his name?

84
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:23,572
Jaden.

85
00:06:23,596 --> 00:06:25,356
Right, Jaden.

86
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:30,111
If you mess with Ro-hee again like this,

87
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:31,863
then...

88
00:06:32,856 --> 00:06:35,867
I'll make sure

89
00:06:36,901 --> 00:06:39,328
that you can't move again.

90
00:06:40,238 --> 00:06:43,249
Got it, you bastard?

91
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,064
Let's not make things complicated.

92
00:06:57,088 --> 00:06:59,640
-Gosh, you talk too much.
-If you...

93
00:07:02,886 --> 00:07:04,530
-Wait.
-What is it?

94
00:07:04,554 --> 00:07:06,314
You just need to press this.

95
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,291
There's a villa we can go to nearby.

96
00:07:15,315 --> 00:07:18,502
It's run by an old couple,
so it'll be safe. Let's head there.

97
00:07:18,526 --> 00:07:19,712
Okay.

98
00:07:19,736 --> 00:07:21,829
-Ro-hee, get in.
-Okay.

99
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,748
Is this the right thing to do?

100
00:07:25,658 --> 00:07:27,668
To publicize everything.

101
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,049
Starting tomorrow,
I won't be by Ro-hee's side.

102
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:37,637
Ro-hee's safety is my priority.

103
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:40,566
Things might get more dangerous
for Ro-hee.

104
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,319
She'll draw the world's attention,

105
00:07:43,343 --> 00:07:45,654
and those who invested
in this experiment through Jaden

106
00:07:45,678 --> 00:07:47,730
may cause harm to Ro-hee.

107
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,318
Bad things may happen,
and things may not go as planned.

108
00:07:53,228 --> 00:07:55,071
But the Ro-hee I know

109
00:07:55,188 --> 00:07:58,658
will stay strong in any situation.

110
00:07:59,442 --> 00:08:01,462
She can't live like this forever.

111
00:08:01,486 --> 00:08:03,204
I just have to trust her.

112
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:07,124
And you and Attorney Choi.

113
00:08:28,513 --> 00:08:35,880
CHAPTER 8. THE FIRST CHILD

114
00:08:40,308 --> 00:08:41,809
BASED ON THE NOVEL
THE DAY OF KIDNAPPING BY JEONG HAE-YEON

115
00:08:57,617 --> 00:08:58,959
Name.

116
00:09:04,332 --> 00:09:06,509
Not even going to say your name?

117
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:11,097
We've met before, twice at that.

118
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:16,070
A cop caught you at the scene,

119
00:09:16,094 --> 00:09:17,613
kidnapping a victim of a kidnapping,

120
00:09:17,637 --> 00:09:21,065
and hiding away
a kidnapper who was arrested.

121
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:25,245
An attorney won't be enough for you.

122
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:27,613
You'd probably need divine intervention.

123
00:09:32,193 --> 00:09:34,245
Damn it.

124
00:09:36,197 --> 00:09:39,134
Those bastards won't talk either,
and they have nothing on them.

125
00:09:39,158 --> 00:09:40,302
I've looked into the evidence.

126
00:09:40,326 --> 00:09:43,421
The first stack is cash,
and the rest are pieces of paper.

127
00:09:43,663 --> 00:09:45,766
What game are you playing?

128
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,102
You negotiated a ransom for a dead kid.

129
00:09:48,126 --> 00:09:49,927
What do you mean, dead?

130
00:09:51,087 --> 00:09:53,097
Right, I'm sorry.

131
00:09:55,091 --> 00:09:58,185
I guess you learned what
pleading the Fifth is from the movies,

132
00:09:58,386 --> 00:10:00,438
but you guys can't leave
since we caught you red-handed.

133
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,481
Staying silent won't change anything

134

VIOLENT CRIMES TEAM 1

135
00:10:04,308 --> 00:10:06,286
Lock him up and file a warrant.

136
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,653
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

138
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,255
Hello, this is Park Sang-yun.

139
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,757
This is Kim Myeong-jun.

140
00:10:37,781 --> 00:10:38,915
You...

141
00:10:40,034 --> 00:10:42,095
Where are you right now?
What are you doing?

142
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:44,254
I called you to ask you a favor.

143
00:10:45,372 --> 00:10:47,475
I don't think you're in the position
to ask for favors.

144
00:10:47,499 --> 00:10:48,601
Where's Choi Ro-hee?

145
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,261
She's alive and well. Don't worry.

146
00:10:51,462 --> 00:10:52,804
Well...

147
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,973
I called you...

148
00:10:56,258 --> 00:10:58,727
because I need your help.

149
00:11:01,972 --> 00:11:03,440
Go ahead.

150
00:11:03,974 --> 00:11:05,275
A negotiation...

151
00:11:06,226 --> 00:11:08,278
will be made for Ro-hee today.

152
00:11:08,812 --> 00:11:10,155
Ro-hee...

153
00:11:10,856 --> 00:11:12,532
will negotiate with her family.

154
00:11:13,108 --> 00:11:14,826
What are you talking about?

155
00:11:14,902 --> 00:11:16,286
Why would she do that?

156
00:11:16,612 --> 00:11:19,790
Those who are paying the ransom for Ro-hee

157
00:11:20,282 --> 00:11:22,927
want to make the public believe
that Ro-hee is dead.

158
00:11:22,951 --> 00:11:26,421
And they're the ones
who locked me and Ro-hee up.

159
00:11:27,247 --> 00:11:28,641
Please arrest them.

160
00:11:28,665 --> 00:11:32,479
Then I'll get Ro-hee out of here safely.

161
00:11:32,503 --> 00:11:34,179
But one thing.

162
00:11:35,381 --> 00:11:37,516
You have to do this alone.

163
00:11:41,053 --> 00:11:42,354
Why?

164
00:11:44,306 --> 00:11:47,567
I think there's a mole in the force.

165
00:11:49,395 --> 00:11:51,571
How can I believe you?

166
00:11:53,816 --> 00:11:55,951
You know my daughter, Hee-ae, right?

167
00:11:55,984 --> 00:11:59,162
Tomorrow is her surgery.

168
00:12:01,281 --> 00:12:03,375
I'm thinking of turning myself in

169
00:12:03,617 --> 00:12:05,220
after I see her get out of surgery.

170
00:12:05,244 --> 00:12:06,837
I'll go to the hospital.

171
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,798
But before that...

172
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,634
I need to take Ro-hee to a safe place.

173
00:12:14,753 --> 00:12:16,138
I'll turn myself in...

174
00:12:17,464 --> 00:12:19,057
after that.

175
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:22,477
Tell me...

176
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,856
what your favor is.

177
00:12:37,818 --> 00:12:39,003
Hello?

178
00:12:39,027 --> 00:12:40,787
Sir, I got some midnight snacks.

179
00:12:40,904 --> 00:12:42,414
It's your favorite, jokbal.

180
00:12:42,781 --> 00:12:44,416
Okay.

Good morning, Dr. Mo.

184
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:45,195
Are you letting me go or killing me?

185
00:13:45,219 --> 00:13:46,728
Leave immediately.

186
00:13:47,387 --> 00:13:49,606
You know I can't.

187
00:13:51,183 --> 00:13:54,152
If you set me free,
only a few people would die.

188
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,489
If you don't, then we might all die.

189
00:13:59,191 --> 00:14:00,826
If you leave, I'll set you free.

190
00:14:02,694 --> 00:14:04,162
Or else, you'll die.

191
00:14:28,136 --> 00:14:30,397
Criticize me all you want.

192
00:14:37,187 --> 00:14:39,656
But this is a choice for everyone.

193
00:14:39,856 --> 00:14:44,286
The most important thing is to prevent
Dr. Choi's research from being publicized.

194
00:14:44,861 --> 00:14:49,207
You don't want Ro-hee to be
everyone's spectacle, do you?

195
00:14:51,285 --> 00:14:53,795
Come on, why would I criticize you?

196
00:14:54,413 --> 00:14:56,339
I'm also a parent.

197
00:14:59,418 --> 00:15:02,512
By the way, what's her name?

198
00:15:03,046 --> 00:15:04,556
Your daughter's name.

199
00:15:09,469 --> 00:15:10,770
Byeol.

200
00:15:11,096 --> 00:15:12,772
I see.

201
00:15:13,682 --> 00:15:14,983
Byeol.

202
00:15:15,851 --> 00:15:17,569
It's pretty.

203
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,448
My daughter's name is Kim Hee-ae,

204
00:15:22,065 --> 00:15:24,367
like the actress.

205
00:15:31,283 --> 00:15:34,085
I saw Byeol last time,
and she's very pretty.

206
00:15:35,454 --> 00:15:37,255
Byeol is lucky

207
00:15:37,873 --> 00:15:39,341
to have a mom who's a doctor.

208
00:15:40,626 --> 00:15:42,093
She must be proud.

209
00:15:47,257 --> 00:15:50,518
Hee-ae was a late talker.

210
00:15:52,012 --> 00:15:54,356
Everyone in her preschool started talking,

211
00:15:54,931 --> 00:15:57,609
but Hee-ae couldn't.

212
00:15:59,645 --> 00:16:02,197
Gosh, I was so anxious back then.

213
00:16:02,939 --> 00:16:04,532
In hindsight,

214
00:16:04,983 --> 00:16:07,327
those worries were pointless.

215
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:11,081
Are you trying to teach me?

216
00:16:11,406 --> 00:16:12,874
No.

217
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:13,822
Oh.

218
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:15,669
Not at all.

219
00:16:15,994 --> 00:16:17,754
I'm just envious.

220
00:16:19,247 --> 00:16:20,966
Hee-ae...

221
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,094
loved playing.

222
00:16:24,294 --> 00:16:27,764
She never read books
and always watched TV.

223
00:16:28,632 --> 00:16:31,601
And when she went to the playground,
she wouldn't come back home.

224
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:36,940
But now,

225
00:16:37,808 --> 00:16:39,859
I wouldn't care if she watched TV all day

226
00:16:40,936 --> 00:16:44,781
and ran around the playground for days.

227
00:16:46,566 --> 00:16:47,909
I just...

228
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,829
want her to get back on her feet.

229
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:05,218
You should go.

230
00:17:06,211 --> 00:17:10,306
I'll take Jackson.

231
00:17:32,571 --> 00:17:35,540
I'm sorry to say this.

232
00:17:36,074 --> 00:17:37,385
Ms. Mo.

233
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:41,337
I think it'd be wise for you to send Byeol
to a normal kindergarten.

234
00:17:42,622 --> 00:17:45,476
Why? What concerns you?

235
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,563
Byeol was a healthy and bright child.

236
00:17:48,587 --> 00:17:51,973
But it seems like
she's getting weaker these days.

237
00:17:52,132 --> 00:17:55,852
Could you please take extra care of her?

238
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,065
All our classes

239
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,660
are taught in English.

240
00:18:02,684 --> 00:18:04,402
But Byeol has trouble keeping up.

241
00:18:05,353 --> 00:18:07,155
She says she hates speaking English.

242
00:18:08,231 --> 00:18:10,617
She lost interest
because she can't understand it,

243
00:18:11,318 --> 00:18:13,828
so it's harder for her
to hang out with her friends.

244
00:18:16,782 --> 00:18:19,751
I'll pay you extra.

245
00:18:19,826 --> 00:18:21,503
Please.

246
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,811
Honestly speaking,

247
00:18:28,835 --> 00:18:32,347
Byeol is slower than other kids.

248
00:18:34,216 --> 00:18:38,061
The results show that she has
low cognitive abilities and hyperactivity.

249
00:18:38,845 --> 00:18:41,439
If you're worried, come to our facility.

250
00:18:42,057 --> 00:18:46,611
She'll get better if she keeps drawing
and hanging out with the kids here.

251
00:18:47,813 --> 00:18:49,114
All right.

252
00:18:49,397 --> 00:18:50,740
I'll see you soon.

253
00:18:57,531 --> 00:18:58,832
Byeol.

254
00:19:12,337 --> 00:19:13,680
Byeol.

255
00:20:06,391 --> 00:20:08,286
Hey, Park Sang-yun!

256
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,204
Where were you all night?

257
00:20:10,228 --> 00:20:12,155
What's with those guys who are locked up?

258
00:20:12,355 --> 00:20:14,750
I caught them red-handed
negotiating for Choi Ro-hee.

259
00:20:14,774 --> 00:20:15,877
What?

260
00:20:15,901 --> 00:20:17,211
Choi Ro-hee is alive.

261
00:20:17,235 --> 00:20:19,088
Are those guys the kidnappers?

262
00:20:19,112 --> 00:20:21,831
I'll have to dig into it.
The warrant will be issued soon.

263
00:20:23,366 --> 00:20:25,261
Don't leave anything behind
and take everything!

264
00:20:25,285 --> 00:20:26,971
-What are you doing?
-Take the pictures!

265
00:20:26,995 --> 00:20:28,973
-This is another case!
-Back up!

266
00:20:28,997 --> 00:20:31,350
This is another case!

267
00:20:31,374 --> 00:20:33,593
-You can't take this!
-Back off!

268
00:20:34,002 --> 00:20:35,428
What are you doing?!

269
00:20:38,173 --> 00:20:39,766
Sang-yun.

270
00:20:41,593 --> 00:20:42,737
What's going on?

271
00:20:42,761 --> 00:20:44,896
We're here to take over
the kidnapping case.

272
00:20:46,556 --> 00:20:50,360
Come on, you should've
given us a call beforehand.

273
00:20:50,685 --> 00:20:52,862
We're taking care of that case.

274
00:20:52,896 --> 00:20:54,999
We arrested the prime suspects last night.

275
00:20:55,023 --> 00:20:56,918
News travels slowly around here.

276
00:20:56,942 --> 00:20:58,826
The warrant was rejected.

277
00:20:58,902 --> 00:21:00,504
-What?
-Take everything!

278
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:02,622
-Yes, sir.
-Hey, don't move.

279
00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:08,137
This is an obstruction of justice.

280
00:21:08,161 --> 00:21:11,589
We're both civil servants,
and you're also obstructing justice.

281
00:21:12,415 --> 00:21:15,061
You people here
really don't care about ranks, do you?

282
00:21:15,085 --> 00:21:16,020
What did you say?

283
00:21:16,044 --> 00:21:18,397
Hey! What's your rank, you bastard?

284
00:21:18,421 --> 00:21:19,982
-You rude bastard!
-Seriously.

285
00:21:20,006 --> 00:21:21,734
This is an order
from the commissioner general!

286
00:21:21,758 --> 00:21:23,945
Have some manners
if you're visiting another station!

287
00:21:23,969 --> 00:21:25,071
I ask for your cooperation.

288
00:21:25,095 --> 00:21:26,405
-Take everything!
-Hey!

289
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:27,573
Stop them!

290
00:21:27,597 --> 00:21:30,159
-Hey!
-Stop, you bastard!

291
00:21:30,183 --> 00:21:31,577
-Damn it!
-You bastards!

292
00:21:31,601 --> 00:21:33,069
Everyone, stop!

293
00:21:34,854 --> 00:21:36,864
The first thing you do at work is fight?

294
00:21:42,153 --> 00:21:44,414
It hasn't even been 12 hours
since I arrested them.

295
00:21:44,614 --> 00:21:48,219
How can the warrant be rejected
when they had the ransom?

296
00:21:48,243 --> 00:21:51,212
When an order comes down,
you have to follow it.

297
00:21:51,246 --> 00:21:54,590
You guys are a bunch of troublemakers.

298
00:21:54,749 --> 00:21:56,509
Who gave this order?

299
00:21:56,626 --> 00:21:57,853
Are you interrogating me?

300
00:21:57,877 --> 00:22:00,471
This isn't the first time
things have been unfair and dirty.

301
00:22:00,505 --> 00:22:02,400
Why can't you let go of this?

302
00:22:02,424 --> 00:22:04,610
Choi Ro-hee, who was apparently
thrown into the sea, is alive.

303
00:22:04,634 --> 00:22:06,769
And we caught them
with the ransom on the scene.

304
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:09,840
So how can you let them go right away?

305
00:22:09,865 --> 00:22:11,792
Who says Choi Ro-hee is alive?

306
00:22:12,017 --> 00:22:14,777
Who says that money
was Choi Ro-hee's ransom?

307
00:22:17,772 --> 00:22:19,157
Who gave you the tip?

308
00:22:21,026 --> 00:22:22,493
Kim Myeong-jun.

309
00:22:22,986 --> 00:22:23,963
What?

310
00:22:23,987 --> 00:22:26,331
What about his number? Did you track it?

311
00:22:26,364 --> 00:22:27,915
He's going to turn himself in.

312
00:22:28,074 --> 00:22:31,294
Today is Kim Myeong-jun's
daughter's surgery.

313
00:22:31,453 --> 00:22:33,421
He's going to the hospital
with Choi Ro-hee.

314
00:22:33,788 --> 00:22:37,050
Damn it. Why would you tell us that now?

315
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,344
The murder and the kidnapping case

316
00:22:39,586 --> 00:22:41,596
can be both concluded at once.

317
00:22:43,339 --> 00:22:47,518
How do you trust him
to turn himself in with Choi Ro-hee?

318
00:22:48,178 --> 00:22:49,562
And also,

319
00:22:49,721 --> 00:22:52,700
how do you trust the statement
that Dr. Choi and his father

320
00:22:52,724 --> 00:22:54,160
conducted experiments on children?

321
00:22:54,184 --> 00:22:55,619
A victim testified.

322
00:22:55,643 --> 00:22:56,996
How do you trust that victim?

323
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,113
They are all circumstantial!

324
00:22:59,481 --> 00:23:01,917
And that victim has a close relationship
with the murderer,

325
00:23:01,941 --> 00:23:04,619
and she's also the kidnapper's wife.

326
00:23:05,236 --> 00:23:08,081
Sir, I'll make sure to bring...

327
00:23:09,074 --> 00:23:11,000
Kim Myeong-jun and Choi Ro-hee in today.

328
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:12,794
Please trust me this once.

329
00:23:13,077 --> 00:23:14,077
Gosh.

330
00:23:14,204 --> 00:23:17,090
Why can't you civil servants
just follow orders?

331
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:19,852
You two better be ready
to give me your badges

332
00:23:19,876 --> 00:23:21,969
if you do something I can't cover.

333
00:23:22,629 --> 00:23:24,263
I need solid evidence.

334
00:23:24,923 --> 00:23:26,641
If you talk without solid evidence,

335
00:23:27,008 --> 00:23:28,726
I can't protect you two.

336
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,146
You still up for this?

337
00:23:33,223 --> 00:23:34,607
Yes, sir.

338
00:23:52,158 --> 00:23:53,960
-Hello?
-It's me.

339
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:56,170
Where are you?

340
00:23:57,038 --> 00:23:58,349
On my way to Seoul.

341
00:23:58,373 --> 00:23:59,674
Are you done?

342
00:24:07,048 --> 00:24:10,268
I have some questions
and things I want to confirm.

343
00:24:10,468 --> 00:24:13,396
But Hee-ae's surgery comes first,
so come to the hospital.

344
00:24:13,596 --> 00:24:15,064
I'll be there.

345
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,196
Don't tell me you forgot
it was her surgery today.

346
00:24:23,022 --> 00:24:26,117
I didn't forget.
I was getting ready to go.

347
00:24:26,943 --> 00:24:29,380
But there will be cops at the hospital.

348
00:24:29,404 --> 00:24:30,663
I know.

349
00:24:31,114 --> 00:24:32,790
I'm on my way to turn myself in.

350
00:24:32,824 --> 00:24:34,041
What about Ro-hee?

351
00:24:34,784 --> 00:24:36,294
She's coming with me.

352
00:24:36,953 --> 00:24:38,588
I have until today.

353
00:24:39,956 --> 00:24:41,716
I'll end everything today.

354
00:24:44,377 --> 00:24:45,720
Make sure you come.

355
00:24:46,254 --> 00:24:47,555
If you don't,

356
00:24:48,173 --> 00:24:50,266
I won't let it slide.

357
00:25:04,063 --> 00:25:05,406
What?

358
00:25:07,901 --> 00:25:11,120
This is what we get
for working so hard last night?

359
00:25:11,571 --> 00:25:14,957
What can we do?
It's an order from the higher-ups.

360
00:25:16,868 --> 00:25:18,512
What on earth is going on?

361
00:25:18,536 --> 00:25:21,255
Where's Detective Park?

362
00:25:21,706 --> 00:25:23,591
He's downstairs.

363
00:25:26,211 --> 00:25:27,553
Let's go.

364
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:31,098
Hey.

365
00:25:33,593 --> 00:25:35,895
You really had divine intervention.

366
00:25:37,013 --> 00:25:38,606
You must think the world is a joke

367
00:25:38,681 --> 00:25:41,567
since you're protected
despite all your illegal activities.

368
00:25:50,568 --> 00:25:51,670
I'll see you again.

369
00:25:51,694 --> 00:25:53,913
And I'll make sure
to wipe that smile off your face.

370
00:25:54,697 --> 00:25:56,415
That damn bastard.

371
00:25:56,658 --> 00:25:59,001
I don't like the look in your eyes.

372
00:26:00,106 --> 00:26:00,892
Gosh.

373
00:26:01,663 --> 00:26:04,099
Should we go after them?

374
00:26:04,123 --> 00:26:05,675
Kim Myeong-jun comes first.

375
00:26:06,584 --> 00:26:08,719
-Let's get ready.
-But sir.

376
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,556
About last night and this situation,

377
00:26:11,631 --> 00:26:14,526
why won't you tell us
who's tipping you off?

378
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,060
Do you not trust us?

379
00:26:17,637 --> 00:26:19,146
I don't even trust myself.

380
00:26:19,764 --> 00:26:21,065
Get ready.

381
00:26:23,142 --> 00:26:24,402
Yes, sir.

382
00:26:32,277 --> 00:26:33,545
You must be nervous.

383
00:26:33,569 --> 00:26:34,672
Sorry?

384
00:26:34,696 --> 00:26:35,756
Right.

385
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,707
The surgery will go well.

386
00:26:37,865 --> 00:26:39,500
Don't worry.

387
00:26:39,826 --> 00:26:41,127
Thank you.

388
00:26:42,912 --> 00:26:44,547
Are you going to go wearing that?

389
00:26:44,998 --> 00:26:45,933
What?

390
00:26:45,957 --> 00:26:48,060
You're going to the hospital
to see your daughter.

391
00:26:48,084 --> 00:26:49,802
Are you going to dress like that?

392
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:54,890
I can't tell
if you're wearing clothes or a rag.

393
00:26:55,258 --> 00:26:57,059
What's wrong with this?

394
00:26:59,095 --> 00:27:01,439
The smell? It's fine.

395
00:27:02,307 --> 00:27:05,276
Attorney Choi,
let's go get some clothes for him.

396
00:27:06,686 --> 00:27:08,154
Okay.

397
00:27:22,744 --> 00:27:25,421
-I'll bring a size bigger.
-Okay.

398
00:27:29,792 --> 00:27:31,052
How do I look?

399
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,098
Well, it's better
than that rag you were wearing.

400
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:39,435
I've never worn a suit in front of her.

401
00:27:39,552 --> 00:27:41,530
What if she doesn't recognize me
because I look too cool?

402
00:27:41,554 --> 00:27:43,939
You don't look that great, so don't worry.

403
00:27:45,141 --> 00:27:46,442
Right?

404
00:27:57,862 --> 00:27:59,163
You guessed it.

405
00:27:59,238 --> 00:28:01,123
He's my kidnapper,

406
00:28:01,949 --> 00:28:03,376
and I'm the victim.

407
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,095
Sorry?

408
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:06,347
Hey!

409
00:28:06,371 --> 00:28:07,765
I'm on my way to turn myself in.

410
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:09,674
-No need to be scared.
-Sorry?

411
00:28:11,042 --> 00:28:12,385
Wait...

412
00:28:12,794 --> 00:28:14,261
Are you okay?

413
00:28:15,088 --> 00:28:16,857
Gosh, she must be shocked!

414
00:28:16,881 --> 00:28:19,809
Goodness, take a deep breath.

415
00:28:23,054 --> 00:28:25,532
-You don't seem okay. Look at me.
-What?

416
00:28:25,556 --> 00:28:27,034
Oh no, you look even more pale.

417
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:28,567
Take a deep breath.

418
00:28:33,481 --> 00:28:34,816
ES HOSPITAL

419
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:36,418
During the rounding, make sure to...

420
00:28:36,442 --> 00:28:37,952
Hello, Dr. Mo.

421
00:28:39,654 --> 00:28:42,299
I'm sorry for being absent so often
when things are busy these days.

422
00:28:42,323 --> 00:28:43,801
Not at all.

423
00:28:43,825 --> 00:28:46,252
Right, you have a guest in your office.

424
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,639
A guest?

425
00:28:48,663 --> 00:28:50,589
You'll be happy to see them.

426
00:28:57,255 --> 00:28:58,681
Mom!

427
00:29:00,675 --> 00:29:02,184
How did you...

428
00:29:09,267 --> 00:29:10,818
Where are they?

429
00:29:11,227 --> 00:29:13,195
We parted ways this morning.

430
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:21,662
Call him.

431
00:29:30,288 --> 00:29:32,173
You're eating so well.

432
00:29:32,248 --> 00:29:34,175
There's shrimp, so take it out, okay?

433
00:29:35,042 --> 00:29:37,261
Ro-hee likes Chinese food.

434
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,929
I see.

435
00:29:39,547 --> 00:29:43,184
It's not that I like Chinese food.
I like the food here.

436
00:29:44,177 --> 00:29:46,270
This is the first time eating here, right?

437
00:29:48,097 --> 00:29:50,451
I'd take the food to-go at times
when I taught her

438
00:29:50,475 --> 00:29:52,276
since Ro-hee couldn't leave the house.

439
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,028
I see.

440
00:29:54,395 --> 00:29:56,238
It's really good.

441
00:29:57,648 --> 00:30:00,951
Gosh, you have a sophisticated palate too.

442
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,090
You should eat. You must be hungry.

443
00:30:05,114 --> 00:30:06,499
I will. Thank you.

444
00:30:07,116 --> 00:30:09,577
DR. MO EUN-SUN

445
00:30:11,537 --> 00:30:12,880
Yes, Dr. Mo.

446
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:16,091
Oh, us?

447
00:30:16,626 --> 00:30:18,511
Not yet. We're still eating.

448
00:30:19,712 --> 00:30:21,013
This place?

449
00:30:21,047 --> 00:30:22,381
CHEONGDAM-DONG SACHEONGUNG

450
00:30:23,132 --> 00:30:24,391
Are you coming?

451
00:30:24,926 --> 00:30:27,394
No, well...

452
00:30:28,888 --> 00:30:30,981
I wanted to ask one more time

453
00:30:31,265 --> 00:30:33,067
if you can let Jaden go.

454
00:30:33,768 --> 00:30:36,153
That's not something for me to decide.

455
00:30:36,854 --> 00:30:38,197
Okay.

456
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:11,063
I guess she's still torn about Jaden.

457
00:31:12,265 --> 00:31:16,193
After all, people move solely
for their own goals.

458
00:31:17,353 --> 00:31:19,405
Anyway, can you defend us in court?

459
00:31:19,855 --> 00:31:21,907
That's my job.

460
00:31:22,191 --> 00:31:23,826
Not for me, but for him.

461
00:31:26,445 --> 00:31:27,705
Me?

462
00:31:28,281 --> 00:31:29,967
The victim's attorney

463
00:31:29,991 --> 00:31:32,886
can't defend the perpetrator.

464
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:35,305
Get him the best attorney you can find.

465
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:37,339
I can pay however much they want.

466
00:31:44,547 --> 00:31:45,848
By the way,

467
00:31:46,507 --> 00:31:49,403
why is this restaurant so empty?

468
00:31:49,427 --> 00:31:50,728
It's weird.

469
00:31:51,846 --> 00:31:54,064
We rented the whole restaurant.

470
00:31:54,181 --> 00:31:55,774
The whole place?

471
00:31:56,601 --> 00:31:58,027
Don't be surprised.

472
00:31:58,144 --> 00:31:59,778
Ro-hee paid for it.

473
00:32:00,605 --> 00:32:03,032
Just how rich are you?

474
00:32:03,065 --> 00:32:04,084
Can you calculate it?

475
00:32:04,108 --> 00:32:05,492
Somewhat.

476
00:32:06,861 --> 00:32:09,413
As for real estate,
there's Dr. Choi's house.

477
00:32:09,739 --> 00:32:12,718
Then there are his hospital shares,
bonds, foreign bonds,

478
00:32:12,742 --> 00:32:14,251
market shares, and savings.

479
00:32:14,493 --> 00:32:16,003
It adds up to around 120 billion won.

480
00:32:16,579 --> 00:32:17,838
What?

481
00:32:18,372 --> 00:32:19,757
Did you say 120 billion won?!

482
00:32:22,418 --> 00:32:23,844
By the way,

483
00:32:24,795 --> 00:32:27,431
how much were you going to ask
as my ransom?

484
00:32:28,883 --> 00:32:30,225
Fifty million won.

485
00:32:30,317 --> 00:32:31,111
Gosh.

486
00:32:31,135 --> 00:32:32,863
That's a blow to my pride.

487
00:32:32,887 --> 00:32:36,148
All I needed was the money
for Hee-ae's surgery.

488
00:32:36,974 --> 00:32:39,443
Ro-hee, do you want
to take a look at this?

489
00:32:39,477 --> 00:32:40,694
What is it?

490
00:32:43,648 --> 00:32:45,866
I'm going through Dr. Choi's emails,

491
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:48,045
and he created a wallet

492
00:32:48,069 --> 00:32:50,371
in a cryptocurrency exchange in Singapore.

493
00:32:50,655 --> 00:32:52,799
It doesn't say how much.

494
00:32:52,823 --> 00:32:56,345
But the date he created the wallet
coincides with when he met Jaden.

495
00:32:56,369 --> 00:32:58,504
Jaden said yesterday

496
00:32:58,621 --> 00:33:01,465
that they won't sit around
since my dad received a lot of money.

497
00:33:01,582 --> 00:33:03,769
Among his financial assets,
the biggest investments

498
00:33:03,793 --> 00:33:06,178
were the 10 billion won
from the Korean investors.

499
00:33:07,588 --> 00:33:10,766
So this is where his foreign money
came through.

500
00:33:10,883 --> 00:33:12,226
Look into it.

501
00:33:12,343 --> 00:33:13,477
Okay.

502
00:33:16,055 --> 00:33:19,400
Aren't we too focused on money
when your dad died?

503
00:33:19,642 --> 00:33:21,527
You won't be with me anymore,

504
00:33:21,977 --> 00:33:24,738
so the only thing
that can protect me is money.

505
00:33:33,364 --> 00:33:36,667
The last time you brought food
from this place...

506
00:33:37,618 --> 00:33:39,420
was the day before the incident.

507
00:33:40,746 --> 00:33:44,216
No wonder I refused to eat
that unpleasant white thing you made.

508
00:33:44,417 --> 00:33:47,761
My body refused it on its own
since I had luxurious food just before.

509
00:33:48,254 --> 00:33:51,566
All right. Just keep eating.

510
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,017
Ro-hee, hold on.

511
00:33:53,509 --> 00:33:56,238
According to your mom's
credit card records,

512
00:33:56,262 --> 00:33:58,522
she came here on May 19th.

513
00:33:58,556 --> 00:33:59,815
What?

514
00:34:00,307 --> 00:34:01,483
Really?

515
00:34:02,893 --> 00:34:04,278
It can't be.

516
00:34:05,312 --> 00:34:06,989
The day before is the 20th.

517
00:34:09,817 --> 00:34:12,170
Are you sure you kidnapped me on the 21st?

518
00:34:12,194 --> 00:34:13,797
Of course.

519
00:34:13,821 --> 00:34:15,622
How could I forget?

520
00:34:19,744 --> 00:34:21,430
Choi Ro-hee witnessed the incident.

521
00:34:21,454 --> 00:34:23,598
We only have
Park Cheol-won's statement for now,

522
00:34:23,622 --> 00:34:26,393
but we'll have more information
when we compare his with Ro-hee's.

523
00:34:26,417 --> 00:34:28,395
What time is the surgery again?

524
00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:30,063
He's coming for sure, right?

525
00:34:30,087 --> 00:34:31,513
Don't worry.

526
00:34:31,547 --> 00:34:33,775
All right. Listen carefully.

527
00:34:33,799 --> 00:34:37,227
I'm on the verge of getting fired here.

528
00:34:37,428 --> 00:34:40,481
You think it's enough with you four?
You want me to request backup?

529
00:34:40,681 --> 00:34:43,025
It's fine.
Kim Myeong-jun won't cause a scene.

530
00:34:43,058 --> 00:34:45,787
We'll quietly bring him here
after her surgery.

531
00:34:45,811 --> 00:34:46,830
Okay.

532
00:34:46,854 --> 00:34:48,248
Let's do it!

533
00:34:48,272 --> 00:34:49,615
-We'll be back.
-Yes, sir.

534
00:34:50,191 --> 00:34:51,575
All right.

535
00:34:52,568 --> 00:34:54,078
-We'll get going.
-Okay.

536
00:34:58,282 --> 00:34:59,541
Go on.

537
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:32,103
Help!

538
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:53,303
I assumed that things went awry
since you didn't call.

539
00:35:53,671 --> 00:35:55,681
I knew you'd get yourself out of it.

540
00:35:57,091 --> 00:35:58,851
Did the boss pull some strings?

541
00:36:00,052 --> 00:36:02,855
Gosh, he's one amazing stud.

542
00:36:03,305 --> 00:36:04,690
Hey.

543
00:36:08,973 --> 00:36:10,919
What are you doing?

544
00:36:15,325 --> 00:36:17,378
I thought everything would be over by now.

545
00:36:17,698 --> 00:36:19,177
What a dissapointment.

546
00:36:42,997 --> 00:36:45,370
Outrageous though, don't you think?

547
00:36:45,674 --> 00:36:46,674
Outrageous?

548
00:36:47,101 --> 00:36:49,467
Take it as a generous warning from me.

549
00:36:49,762 --> 00:36:53,142
Generous enough to show you your impending future.

550
00:36:53,406 --> 00:36:56,172
Remember, it'll be a loaded gun next time.

551
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:57,554
Yes, sir.

552
00:36:57,768 --> 00:36:59,801
Secure Mr. Choi's research report.

553
00:36:59,825 --> 00:37:03,362
And bring me his daughter, the product of this research.

554
00:37:03,636 --> 00:37:07,308
You got to call it a day before the ship from Russia arrives.

555
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:12,017
If not, you know damn well it wouldn't end like this.

556
00:37:14,387 --> 00:37:16,677
Once I find the research report,

557
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:18,701
the child wouldn't be needed anymore, sir.

558
00:37:18,725 --> 00:37:20,461
That won't be the case,

559
00:37:20,485 --> 00:37:23,283
his very first child will make history.

560
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,626
We're going to the operating unit.

561
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,058
Hee-ae is going to the operating unit.

562
00:37:53,082 --> 00:37:55,259
Kim Myeong-jun isn't here yet.

563
00:37:58,545 --> 00:38:00,357
Over there.

564
00:38:00,381 --> 00:38:02,224
Can I go buy that teddy bear?

565
00:38:02,466 --> 00:38:04,569
I won't be seeing for a while after today,

566
00:38:04,593 --> 00:38:06,071
so I don't want to go empty-handed.

567
00:38:06,095 --> 00:38:07,697
Sure, I'll go get the car.

568
00:38:07,721 --> 00:38:09,157
I'll wait outside then.

569
00:38:09,181 --> 00:38:10,482
Okay.

570
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,318
You want one too?

571
00:38:13,602 --> 00:38:14,913
I don't need one.

572
00:38:14,937 --> 00:38:16,122
Hurry back.

573
00:38:16,146 --> 00:38:17,614
Okay.

574
00:38:21,026 --> 00:38:23,161
-I'll take that one.
-Okay.

575
00:38:24,279 --> 00:38:25,914
Thank you.

576
00:38:33,247 --> 00:38:35,558
-Attorney Choi.
-Yes?

577
00:38:35,582 --> 00:38:38,552
I can't seem to remember
what happened on the 20th.

578
00:38:38,794 --> 00:38:40,137
Why is that?

579
00:38:41,344 --> 00:38:42,607
Ah?

580
00:38:42,631 --> 00:38:45,350
How can I not remember that one day?

581
00:38:45,467 --> 00:38:48,312
Maybe it's because
your memories aren't fully back yet.

582
00:38:51,807 --> 00:38:53,692
It doesn't add up

583
00:38:54,143 --> 00:38:57,863
because I clearly remember the 19th,
which is when I had Chinese food.

584
00:38:58,022 --> 00:39:01,783
and the 21st,
which is when I got kidnapped.

585
00:39:06,268 --> 00:39:07,268
Ah.

586
00:39:08,523 --> 00:39:09,523
Ah!

587
00:39:11,076 --> 00:39:13,420
What's wrong?

588
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:15,306
Are you okay?

589
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,631
What's wrong?

590
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:22,512
I'm fine.

591
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:25,974
I won't pass out.

592
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,446
No!

593
00:39:40,272 --> 00:39:41,531
Attorney Choi.

594
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:46,453
Attorney Choi...

595
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,380
Attorney Choi!

596
00:40:05,756 --> 00:40:07,358
Attorney Choi.

597
00:40:07,382 --> 00:40:08,725
Attorney Choi!

598
00:40:08,967 --> 00:40:10,435
Kim Myeong-jun!

599
00:40:10,469 --> 00:40:12,489
Kim Myeong-jun! Hurry up!

600
00:40:12,513 --> 00:40:14,398
Attorney Choi!

601
00:40:14,598 --> 00:40:16,191
Kim Myeong-jun!

602
00:40:16,308 --> 00:40:17,567
Kim Myeong...

603
00:40:26,985 --> 00:40:28,328
Attorney Choi!

604
00:40:29,363 --> 00:40:30,673
Ro-hee!

605
00:40:30,697 --> 00:40:32,374
Goodness.

606
00:40:33,784 --> 00:40:35,085
Attorney Choi!

607
00:40:36,453 --> 00:40:38,171
My goodness.

608
00:40:38,372 --> 00:40:39,673
Phone.

609
00:40:45,379 --> 00:40:47,190
A man was stabbed!

610
00:40:47,214 --> 00:40:49,484
This is the parking lot of Sacheongung!

611
00:40:49,508 --> 00:40:51,319
It's Cheongdam-dong! Yes!

612
00:40:51,343 --> 00:40:52,654
Please hurry!

613
00:40:52,678 --> 00:40:54,396
Thank you.

614
00:40:54,763 --> 00:40:56,282
Hold on.

615
00:40:56,306 --> 00:40:58,525
Where's Ro-hee?

616
00:40:58,685 --> 00:40:59,661
There.

617
00:40:59,685 --> 00:41:00,787
Hang on.

618
00:41:00,811 --> 00:41:02,038
Ro-hee.

619
00:41:02,062 --> 00:41:03,280
Ro-hee!

620
00:41:03,856 --> 00:41:05,198
Ro-hee!

621
00:41:10,057 --> 00:41:11,238
Damn it!

622
00:41:12,489 --> 00:41:13,790
Damn it.

623
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:24,468
-The entrance?
-Not yet.

624
00:41:37,472 --> 00:41:39,367
Excuse me. Is the surgery starting?

625
00:41:39,391 --> 00:41:41,860
-What about her guardian?
-She's here.

626
00:41:51,195 --> 00:41:54,956
I told you getting rid of me
won't end this.

627
00:41:55,157 --> 00:41:56,541
Leave Ro-hee here!

628
00:41:58,535 --> 00:41:59,804
You should go first.

629
00:41:59,828 --> 00:42:02,297
I'll send her to you
when she becomes useless.

630
00:42:05,292 --> 00:42:07,135
Let me ask you a question.

631
00:42:08,253 --> 00:42:10,013
What is Choi Ro-hee to you?

632
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:12,516
Why are you throwing yourself
to protect her?

633
00:42:12,549 --> 00:42:13,943
Is it for money?

634
00:42:13,967 --> 00:42:16,770
We can give you that too, you know?

635
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:20,273
You should act smart.

636
00:42:27,272 --> 00:42:28,990
You bastard!

637
00:42:33,028 --> 00:42:34,172
I told you

638
00:42:34,196 --> 00:42:36,706
I'd make sure that you can't move
if you touch her again.

639
00:42:44,498 --> 00:42:45,799
Where is she?

640
00:42:51,046 --> 00:42:52,389
You bastard.

641
00:43:21,702 --> 00:43:22,961
Ro-hee.

642
00:43:23,245 --> 00:43:25,098
You can't take Ro-hee.

643
00:43:25,122 --> 00:43:26,381
Ro-hee.

644
00:43:29,501 --> 00:43:31,646
Ro-hee!

645
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:33,513
Ro-hee!

646
00:43:34,381 --> 00:43:35,640
Ro-hee!

647
00:43:39,303 --> 00:43:40,604
Ro-hee!

648
00:43:55,277 --> 00:43:57,537
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

649
00:43:59,031 --> 00:44:00,498
Any news on the first floor?

650
00:44:03,327 --> 00:44:04,878
Nothing here.

651
00:44:04,911 --> 00:44:06,546
Is he not coming?

652
00:44:08,707 --> 00:44:10,258
Ju-hyeok, have you seen him?

653
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,885
Not yet, sir.

654
00:44:14,004 --> 00:44:16,181
-Are you Hee-ae's guardian?
-Yes.

655
00:44:16,256 --> 00:44:18,099
The surgery went well.

656
00:44:18,717 --> 00:44:19,986
Thank you.

657
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:21,612
Let's keep an eye on her recovery.

658
00:44:21,636 --> 00:44:23,563
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

659
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:40,121
I'm glad it went well.

660
00:44:40,655 --> 00:44:42,040
Thank you.

661
00:44:44,117 --> 00:44:47,045
Did Mr. Kim Myeong-jun call by any chance?

662
00:44:48,246 --> 00:44:49,839
This afternoon.

663
00:44:50,957 --> 00:44:52,477
He said he'd come to the hospital.

664
00:44:52,501 --> 00:44:54,344
Has he called you since then?

665
00:45:01,301 --> 00:45:03,770
Did he call you on a public phone?

666
00:45:04,513 --> 00:45:07,148
No, it was a cell phone.

667
00:45:11,353 --> 00:45:13,029
-Here.
-Okay.

668
00:45:16,108 --> 00:45:17,409
Thank you.

669
00:45:18,485 --> 00:45:20,412
Hello, this is Park Sang-yun from--

670
00:45:22,614 --> 00:45:23,957
Where is he?

671
00:45:24,533 --> 00:45:25,792
A hospital?

672
00:45:30,497 --> 00:45:32,600
I'm the detective who called earlier.

673
00:45:32,624 --> 00:45:34,300
Right, this way.

674
00:45:46,012 --> 00:45:48,491
He was bleeding heavily
due to a stab wound in the abdomen.

675
00:45:48,515 --> 00:45:50,191
He's stable now.

676
00:45:50,684 --> 00:45:51,985
I see.

677
00:46:06,825 --> 00:46:09,878
-Hey.
-It happened here, all right.

678
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:12,223
He broke the CCTV as well.

679
00:46:12,247 --> 00:46:14,257
The CCTV? Who?

680
00:46:14,291 --> 00:46:17,385
That bastard we let go this morning.

681
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:26,144
-Where's Kim Myeong-jun?
-He disappeared.

682
00:46:26,511 --> 00:46:27,729
Damn it.

683
00:46:28,054 --> 00:46:30,283
He's damn tough, isn't he?

684
00:46:30,307 --> 00:46:31,691
What should we do with her?

685
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:34,402
Just leave her be.

686
00:46:34,769 --> 00:46:36,780
We'll take her to Russia like this.

687
00:46:54,498 --> 00:46:59,211
VIOLENT CRIMES TEAM 1

688
00:46:59,377 --> 00:47:01,596
The disciplinary meeting
will be held tomorrow.

689
00:47:02,881 --> 00:47:04,432
Go home and rest.

690
00:47:14,434 --> 00:47:15,369
Go home.

691
00:47:15,393 --> 00:47:16,945
Good work today, everyone.

692
00:47:17,687 --> 00:47:19,072
Where are you going?

693
00:47:24,653 --> 00:47:25,995
Home.

694
00:47:45,882 --> 00:47:47,183
The door has opened.

695
00:48:35,056 --> 00:48:36,608
Look at you.

696
00:48:38,101 --> 00:48:39,736
What happened?

697
00:48:43,231 --> 00:48:44,657
What about Hee-ae?

698
00:48:45,191 --> 00:48:47,035
The surgery went well.

699
00:48:50,071 --> 00:48:51,497
Why are you alone?

700
00:48:52,073 --> 00:48:53,374
What about Ro-hee?

701
00:48:56,286 --> 00:48:57,629
I lost her.

702
00:48:57,787 --> 00:48:58,848
What?

703
00:48:58,872 --> 00:49:00,683
Where? How?

704
00:49:00,707 --> 00:49:01,966
Don't worry.

705
00:49:02,626 --> 00:49:04,135
I'll find her again.

706
00:49:11,343 --> 00:49:13,978
I thought everything would be over today.

707
00:49:15,889 --> 00:49:17,148
I thought...

708
00:49:18,266 --> 00:49:19,984
Ro-hee would go back to where she was,

709
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,947
and I would see...

710
00:49:25,357 --> 00:49:27,533
Hee-ae go into the operating unit.

711
00:49:31,821 --> 00:49:33,414
I didn't care...

712
00:49:34,491 --> 00:49:36,376
what happened to me

713
00:49:37,118 --> 00:49:39,045
if I could make that happen.

714
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:44,092
Damn it.

715
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:47,951
Gosh.

716
00:49:49,381 --> 00:49:51,224
I want to die.

717
00:49:51,591 --> 00:49:53,142
Why would you die?

718
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:55,812
You have Hee-ae.

719
00:49:59,265 --> 00:50:01,118
Hee-ae's in the recovery room,

720
00:50:01,142 --> 00:50:04,195
so let's go to the hospital tomorrow
and see her.

721
00:50:04,646 --> 00:50:06,572
Then go to the police station after.

722
00:50:06,606 --> 00:50:09,492
The best thing to do for Hee-ae
is for you to turn yourself in

723
00:50:09,818 --> 00:50:11,744
and end everything.

724
00:50:15,907 --> 00:50:17,250
What's your relationship...

725
00:50:18,576 --> 00:50:20,795
with Ro-hee's dad's murderer?

726
00:50:23,665 --> 00:50:24,924
He's the one...

727
00:50:27,043 --> 00:50:28,938
who gave me the scar on my neck.

728
00:50:28,962 --> 00:50:30,263
What?

729
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:33,683
Don't tell me...

730
00:50:35,468 --> 00:50:37,061
What?

731
00:50:37,512 --> 00:50:38,938
What are you getting at?

732
00:50:39,681 --> 00:50:41,065
I didn't.

733
00:50:42,142 --> 00:50:44,444
I may have told you to kidnap Ro-hee,

734
00:50:44,561 --> 00:50:46,946
but I never told someone to commit murder.

735
00:50:47,397 --> 00:50:49,115
So don't worry.

736
00:50:57,574 --> 00:51:00,168
You should rest for now.

737
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:04,839
Let's go see Hee-ae

738
00:51:05,331 --> 00:51:07,008
first thing tomorrow.

739
00:51:08,418 --> 00:51:09,562
After I find Ro-hee.

740
00:51:09,586 --> 00:51:11,220
Turn yourself in first!

741
00:51:14,048 --> 00:51:18,019
Until when are you going
to neglect Hee-ae?

742
00:51:38,072 --> 00:51:39,624
No, Dr. Choi.

743
00:51:39,741 --> 00:51:41,427
You've never stabbed someone before,
have you?

744
00:51:41,451 --> 00:51:43,002
-Stab me. I'll stand still.
-No, sir.

745
00:51:43,703 --> 00:51:46,089
Go ahead, Mr. Park.

746
00:51:47,457 --> 00:51:48,758
Stab me, you bastard--

747
00:52:02,555 --> 00:52:06,526
There was no money.
I only found strange documents.

748
00:52:14,442 --> 00:52:15,503
Documents?

749
00:52:15,527 --> 00:52:18,037
I heard there were documents in the safe.

750
00:52:18,154 --> 00:52:19,664
But I don't see them.

751
00:52:19,697 --> 00:52:20,716
What documents?

752
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:22,176
Mr. Park Cheol-won broke into the house

753
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,627
and only found documents
when he opened the safe.

754
00:52:24,744 --> 00:52:26,671
So he turned back and left the room.

755
00:52:26,913 --> 00:52:29,433
I was wondering if you kept them.

756
00:52:29,457 --> 00:52:31,926
No, we didn't find any documents.

757
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:36,556
If there was something in the safe,
I'm sure we would've kept it.

758
00:52:37,257 --> 00:52:38,808
Right?

759
00:52:42,804 --> 00:52:44,689
Thank you.

760
00:53:54,584 --> 00:53:58,463
CHOI RO-HEE RECORD

761
00:54:23,905 --> 00:54:25,164
Hey.

762
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:27,708
What brings you here at this hour?

763
00:54:31,621 --> 00:54:33,265
We overlooked something at the scene.

764
00:54:33,289 --> 00:54:35,833
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

765
00:54:36,334 --> 00:54:37,718
Goodness.

766
00:54:38,544 --> 00:54:42,306
This is why I hate working
with sleepless people.

767
00:54:45,218 --> 00:54:47,061
-There are more here.
-Okay.

768
00:54:50,181 --> 00:54:51,742
When will I look through all of them?

769
00:54:51,766 --> 00:54:53,317
How much time do I have?

770
00:54:53,851 --> 00:54:56,529
There isn't much time.
The disciplinary meeting is tomorrow.

771
00:54:58,064 --> 00:55:00,658
Is this your last dance
before you turn in your badge?

772
00:55:00,775 --> 00:55:02,461
Is there anything I can help you with?

773
00:55:02,485 --> 00:55:03,911
Can you read these?

774
00:55:05,697 --> 00:55:08,008
-I'll go get coffee.
-Plus two energy drinks.

775
00:55:08,032 --> 00:55:09,292
Yes, ma'am.

776
00:55:44,235 --> 00:55:48,781
COME TO THE HOSPITAL!

777
00:56:51,344 --> 00:56:52,686
Hey!

778
00:56:53,346 --> 00:56:54,531
It must be nice.

779
00:56:54,555 --> 00:56:57,942
Look at you sleeping like a baby
when you're about to turn your badge in.

780
00:56:59,227 --> 00:57:00,537
I'm sorry.

781
00:57:00,561 --> 00:57:02,289
Did you find anything?

782
00:57:02,313 --> 00:57:03,614
Yes.

783
00:57:03,648 --> 00:57:06,992
These are records that were written
since Dr. Choi Dong-eok's time.

784
00:57:07,401 --> 00:57:09,254
Just as Seo Hye-eun said in her statement,

785
00:57:09,278 --> 00:57:11,048
he tried to artificially amplify

786
00:57:11,072 --> 00:57:13,749
brain functions using medical technology.

787
00:57:13,908 --> 00:57:17,179
Most children were research subjects,
not experimental subjects.

788
00:57:17,203 --> 00:57:19,880
Only two children
were the subjects of his experiment.

789
00:57:19,956 --> 00:57:21,465
What's the difference?

790
00:57:22,166 --> 00:57:23,268
Well...

791
00:57:23,292 --> 00:57:26,730
Although MRI scans were already being used
in the United Kingdom since the 1970s,

792
00:57:26,754 --> 00:57:30,599
we officially started using them
in Korea in 1988.

793
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:34,728
He used them in his personal research.

794
00:57:35,304 --> 00:57:37,189
His methodology was simple.

795
00:57:37,223 --> 00:57:40,202
He matched the children's IQ

796
00:57:40,226 --> 00:57:43,612
and the result
of that children's MRI scan.

797
00:57:43,813 --> 00:57:47,741
But as for experimental subjects,
it's quite cruel.

798
00:57:48,025 --> 00:57:49,618
He injected...

799
00:57:50,027 --> 00:57:53,747
genetically modified viruses
into the subject's brain to stimulate it.

800
00:57:53,823 --> 00:57:56,260
I think he tried to expand
the hippocampus,

801
00:57:56,284 --> 00:57:58,419
which plays a major role in memory.

802
00:57:58,494 --> 00:58:00,796
It's risky,
thus it was called an experiment.

803
00:58:01,664 --> 00:58:06,478
I think that's why he faked an adoption
to run experiments on Seo Hye-eun.

804
00:58:06,502 --> 00:58:08,981
Then did Choi Jin-tae
undergo the same experiment?

805
00:58:09,005 --> 00:58:11,974
No. Choi Jin-tae
has always been intelligent.

806
00:58:12,508 --> 00:58:13,642
Here.

807
00:58:14,177 --> 00:58:16,937
Look. His IQ was 152.

808
00:58:17,346 --> 00:58:18,699
Many were against

809
00:58:18,723 --> 00:58:21,618
Dr. Choi Dong-eok's experiment
in the academic community.

810
00:58:21,642 --> 00:58:23,537
They wanted to stop him at all costs.

811
00:58:23,561 --> 00:58:27,156
So he had no choice
but to stop the experiment.

812
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,792
As a result,

813
00:58:28,816 --> 00:58:31,837
I think he tried to find his successor

814
00:58:31,861 --> 00:58:34,413
by adopting a bright child from the start.

815
00:58:34,989 --> 00:58:36,290
Let's see.

816
00:58:36,574 --> 00:58:39,752
This is the research record
that Choi Jin-tae wrote.

817
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:42,514
But his records stop

818
00:58:42,538 --> 00:58:44,715
when Ro-hee becomes two years old.

819
00:58:45,291 --> 00:58:47,426
-Why?
-I don't know.

820
00:58:47,627 --> 00:58:51,138
I think he kept the records
in another place.

821
00:58:52,924 --> 00:58:54,517
Where could he have kept it?

822
00:58:56,802 --> 00:58:58,646
The kidnapping and the murder

823
00:58:59,096 --> 00:59:02,242
may all be happening
to take control of this experiment.

824
00:59:02,266 --> 00:59:03,776
Probably.

825
00:59:04,018 --> 00:59:06,237
By the way,

826
00:59:06,312 --> 00:59:09,114
they demanded 30 billion won
for Choi Ro-hee?

827
00:59:09,148 --> 00:59:10,783
That's surprisingly little.

828
00:59:14,278 --> 00:59:17,540
Last night,
I lost the kid and the kidnapper.

829
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:19,509
The kidnapper,
who was clueless about all this,

830
00:59:19,533 --> 00:59:21,220
got involved in a big fight.

831
00:59:21,244 --> 00:59:23,754
The kidnapper. I told you, right?

832
00:59:24,038 --> 00:59:26,715
Only two children
were experimental subjects.

833
00:59:26,916 --> 00:59:28,018
Yes.

834
00:59:28,042 --> 00:59:31,220
The candidate of the experimental subject
before Seo Hye-eun.

835
00:59:32,129 --> 00:59:33,806
The first child.

836
00:59:38,344 --> 00:59:40,521
Kim Myeong-jun from Hope Orphanage.

837
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:50,022

THE KIDNAPPING DAY

841
01:01:00,593 --> 01:01:02,654
The kid who was a candidate
of the experimental subject grew up

842
01:01:02,678 --> 01:01:05,240
and kidnapped
the complete product of the experiment.

843
01:01:05,264 --> 01:01:08,035
Are you saying
Kim Myeong-jun intentionally kidnapped

844
01:01:08,059 --> 01:01:09,578
and murdered Choi Ro-hee?

845
01:01:09,602 --> 01:01:12,039
If you turn yourself in
and be cooperative,

846
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:14,082
the cops will find Ro-hee.

847
01:01:14,106 --> 01:01:15,250
Why did you come here?

848
01:01:15,274 --> 01:01:17,919
I have to find Ro-hee,
but I have nowhere to go.

849
01:01:17,943 --> 01:01:20,422
When people find out Ro-hee is a genius,

850
01:01:20,446 --> 01:01:22,591
she'll become an animal in the zoo.

851
01:01:22,615 --> 01:01:26,303
What do I have to do to prevent people
from falling into more danger?

852
01:01:26,327 --> 01:01:28,087
Show them what they want.

853
01:01:28,204 --> 01:01:29,765
Where's Park Sang-yun?

854
01:01:29,789 --> 01:01:33,352
If grown-ups' twisted desires
are what's making Ro-hee suffer,

855
01:01:33,376 --> 01:01:34,436
I should save her.

856
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:36,095
Why are you going so far?

857
01:01:36,128 --> 01:01:37,856
I need to keep my promise.

858
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:40,182
Where are you, Mr. Kim?
