00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,604
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS, GROUPS,

2
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,856
AND SETTINGS ARE FICTITIOUS,
AND CHILD SAFETY GUIDELINES WERE FOLLOWED

3
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:30,800
Don't be nervous, Ro-hee.

4
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:33,886
You will be the hope of humankind.

5
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:51,320
{\an8}BASED ON THE NOVEL
<i>THE DAY OF KIDNAPPING</i> BY JEONG HAE-YEON

6
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:15,302
{\an8}You're up.

7
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:18,597
{\an8}We need to run you through more tests,

8
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,642
{\an8}but I'm glad you're safe
without any injuries.

9
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,603
{\an8}I wasn't alone.

10
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,860
Where's the man who was with me?

11
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:52,923
You...

12
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:04,226
Follow me.

13
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,419
Ro-hee.

14
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:32,880
Ro-hee!

15
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:37,217
What are you doing to Ro-hee?

16
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:38,636
Ro-hee!

17
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,554
Don't worry.

18
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,683
We're checking if any functions were lost
while she was missing.

19
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:48,437
Thankfully, her brain functions
seem to be intact.

20
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:54,151
Her memory loss seems to be temporary,

21
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,611
so she'll recover soon.

22
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,198
Were you the one
who was trying to hurt her?

23
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:03,911
Hurt her?

24
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,205
We can't hurt her.

25
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:27,017
CHAPTER 5. THE GENIUS CHILD

26
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:31,397
<i>This is the scene from the car chase</i>
<i>last night in Seoul</i>

27
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:33,232
<i>that shocked the public.</i>

28
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,693
<i>We received footage</i>
<i>of the scene from the public.</i>

29
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:36,735
{\an8}<i>Let's take a look.</i>

30
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:38,737
{\an8}<i>We see a car zooming through,</i>

31
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:41,156
{\an8}<i>and a motorcycle chasing the said car.</i>

32
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,366
{\an8}<i>It has been revealed</i>

33
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,326
{\an8}<i>that the motorcycle driver</i>
<i>is the kidnapper</i>

34
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,869
{\an8}<i>of the recent Youngin Kidnapping Case,</i>

35
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,663
{\an8}<i>which has shocked the public even further.</i>

36
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,207
{\an8}<i>The police have failed to capture them.</i>

37
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:51,709
<i>- The--</i>
- Damn it.

38
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:57,506
You want me to hand over the case?

39
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,926
Who told you to make a scene
in another station's jurisdiction?

40
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,392
Chief...

41
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:11,770
was dragged to the headquarters
in the morning.

42
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,440
The Regional Investigation Unit
will take the case.

43
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,525
We just have to
focus on the murder case now.

44
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,485
I'll go meet the chief.

45
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,154
Park Sang-yun!

46
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,573
Do you not respect the ranks?

47
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,908
You have to respect the system!

48
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,119
You said no one will hold me back here.

49
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,871
You told me to do what I want.

50
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,458
Then you should've captured him yesterday!

51
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,878
This happened because you let him escape
right under your nose!

52
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:41,383
A kidnapping and murder case
took place in the same house.

53
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,595
The kidnapper threw himself
to save the victim.

54
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,388
The murderer disappeared without a trace.

55
00:05:46,472 --> 00:05:47,473
This...

56
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,808
isn't an ordinary kidnapping case.

57
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,727
If we hand it over now,

58
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:54,813
both the murder
and the kidnapping case will go cold.

59
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:00,819
Sir.

60
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,324
Just give me one week.

61
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,826
Kim Myeong-jun, Choi Ro-hee,

62
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:10,287
and the murderer.

63
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,040
I'll bring all of them in.

64
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:14,750
Please.

65
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:21,715
I can only buy you two days.

66
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,802
I can't give you any more than that.

67
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:31,141
Two days.

68
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:33,936
Two.

69
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:39,733
{\an8}CHOI JIN-TAE, SO JIN-YU
KIM MYEONG-JUN, CHOI RO-HEE

70
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:45,989
- Ju-hyeok.
- Yes?

71
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:46,990
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

72
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,327
Sir, I'm going out.

73
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,497
- Where?
- The orphanage Kim Myeong-jun grew up at.

74
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:55,916
With Ju-hyeok?

75
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,584
Let him stay. I'll go with you.

76
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,212
You should rest. We can go by ourselves.

77
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:02,047
I can sleep in the car.

78
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:05,592
Ju-hyeok, I'll go with him.

79
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:11,056
Dr. Choi Jin-tae
studied children's brains.

80
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,143
It's been studied
since his father's generation.

81
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,771
This villa

82
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:20,732
is like a fortress that he used to visit
since his father was alive.

83
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:23,277
I see.

84
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:26,363
But what kind of brain research?

85
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,533
Normally, the human brain

86
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:33,495
expands and develops until the age of 20.

87
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,165
He researched the expansion
of the human brain.

88
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:41,211
His experiment used medical technology
to expand every function of the brain.

89
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,547
Ro-hee was the subject of that experiment.

90
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:48,719
<i>Ro-hee's IQ is 200, which is</i>
<i>the maximum number the system can read.</i>

91
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,639
<i>However, her brain shows expansion</i>
<i>beyond that number.</i>

92
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,021
<i>She has a photographic memory</i>

93
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,982
<i>and outstanding cognitive</i>
<i>and application skills.</i>

94
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:06,778
<i>Ro-hee is a genius child</i>
<i>who's in the top 0.01 percentile.</i>

95
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,210
Congratulations.

96
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:22,920
Perfect score as usual.

97
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,773
Checkmate.

98
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:54,910
Head!

99
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,163
Out.

100
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:01,500
<i>Dr. Choi was murdered</i>
<i>in the process of his research.</i>

101
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,003
However, this research can't stop.

102
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:06,588
And it shouldn't be.

103
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:11,051
Many people have their hopes up
watching Ro-hee grow up.

104
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,387
We can't disappoint them.

105
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,932
I'm saying this isn't just about Ro-hee.

106
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:30,862
I heard your child is sick.

107
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:34,658
We'll actively support

108
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:37,119
your child, Mr. Kim.

109
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:41,456
That includes her surgery, recovery,
study, and everything else.

110
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:45,502
We'll ensure
your child's safety and future.

111
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,964
Then are you the one
who paid for Hee-ae's hospital bills?

112
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:52,968
I see.

113
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:58,056
What's the reason for bringing me here

114
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:00,767
instead of turning me in to the police?

115
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,231
We were just going to bring Ro-hee.

116
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,359
But I heard you protected her
until the very end.

117
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,990
It seems like Ro-hee trusts you a lot.

118
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,410
However,

119
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,705
we didn't want her
to get emotionally unstable

120
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,958
since we had to continue this experiment.

121
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,046
You'll part ways with her on good terms

122
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,590
and disappear somewhere into the world.

123
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,843
Until the public forgets about you--

124
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:35,886
Excuse me.

125
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,263
Disappear?

126
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,806
Disappear where?

127
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,824
I saw the news.

128
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,659
I was shocked.

129
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,578
He isn't the type to do that.

130
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,206
Has he contacted you recently?

131
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,417
The last time he contacted me

132
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:10,128
was about a year ago.

133
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:13,423
He sounded very desperate
and said that his child was sick.

134
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:16,134
So I sent him some money.

135
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:19,679
Since then, he hasn't called.

136
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,808
He's kind-hearted,

137
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,477
so he isn't the type
to do shameful things.

138
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:30,857
I saw that Mr. Kim Myeong-jun has a record

139
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:32,150
from when he was in high school.

140
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:39,908
It's already been 20 years
since the incident.

141
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:47,874
2001 NATIONAL TEAM 2ND TRYOUTS

142
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,793
You got this!

143
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:57,676
Stop.

144
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:05,517
<i>Myeong-jun was the one</i>
<i>who was most shocked</i>

145
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,853
<i>due to the incident.</i>

146
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,067
Intentional or not,

147
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,029
I killed someone.

148
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:24,828
Just let me be punished, Father.

149
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,007
YOUNGIN PRISON

150
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,437
<i>After he was released,</i>

151
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,607
<i>he didn't return to the orphanage.</i>

152
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:58,487
THE BEGINNING OF A NEW LIFE!
THIS IS WHERE HOPE BEGINS

153
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,491
I heard he's been living diligently.

154
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,411
He got married to Hye-eun and had a child.

155
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:08,497
I thought he'd live a good life.

156
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,457
What a shame.

157
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:11,917
Hye-eun?

158
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:15,128
Do you know Kim Myeong-jun's wife well?

159
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:16,296
Yes.

160
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,967
She was his friend from the orphanage.

161
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:30,352
Where could Seo Hye-eun be
amidst this mess?

162
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,607
There was a burner phone
in the car Kim Myeong-jun burned, right?

163
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,650
Yes.

164
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,028
There was Dr. Choi and another number
on the call history.

165
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,113
That number was also a burner phone.

166
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,366
Could that be Seo Hye-eun?

167
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:45,909
It could be.

168
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,539
A missing wife came back
with a burner phone?

169
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,415
I'll look for her.

170
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,458
Okay.

171
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,627
Man, this case is complicated.

172
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:58,129
Hey.

173
00:13:58,964 --> 00:13:59,839
Really?

174
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,174
Send me the address.

175
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:05,637
They found the nurse who worked at
Choi Dong-eok's hospital 30 years ago.

176
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:07,222
Let's get going then.

177
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:08,348
Yes, sir.

178
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,099
Ro-hee taught herself how to read music

179
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,643
and its relationship to the keyboard.

180
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,771
She learned all of them by herself,

181
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,275
and now, she's capable
of playing any songs.

182
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:13,663
Take a seat.

183
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:22,005
This is a room for the investors
to watch her.

184
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,925
When they wanted to see
how Ro-hee was growing up,

185
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,720
Dr. Choi conducted open experiments here.

186
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,983
Goodness.

187
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:29,906
Why aren't you eating?

188
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,200
None of them look good.

189
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:35,829
Everything here looks good! Goodness.

190
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,085
Should I make you something good?

191
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,344
There.

192
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,102
All right.

193
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:02,313
Ta-da!

194
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:03,898
It's white <i>buchimgae.</i>

195
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,693
I thought I made myself clear.

196
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,738
I told you not to make this
unpleasant thing ever again.

197
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:12,490
Hey, this flour hasn't even expired yet.

198
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:13,867
Just hang tight.

199
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,161
Here.

200
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,205
You put this on your hand,

201
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,958
and put these in

202
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:23,793
and this.

203
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,336
Here, try it.

204
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:27,589
What on earth is this?

205
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,011
It's good, right?

206
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,516
Well, it's not bad.

207
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,561
I told you.

208
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,275
For a parting gift, that is.

209
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,698
I can tell that you decided to leave.

210
00:17:58,036 --> 00:17:59,579
No need to make that face.

211
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,749
I understand where you stand.

212
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:05,502
I'm sorry.

213
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:08,963
For what?

214
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:10,757
It's just...

215
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:13,468
I feel like I ruined you.

216
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:15,929
How ridiculous.

217
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:19,224
I'm rich and smart.

218
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,392
You think you can ruin me?

219
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,230
Did you regain all your memories?

220
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:28,066
Mostly.

221
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,861
But I don't remember the day
of the incident.

222
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,199
It's not important to me anyway.

223
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:40,036
I don't want to...

224
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:45,416
find the murderer
who killed my parents anymore.

225
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:49,462
Funny, right?

226
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:56,636
I wanted to get my revenge
when I lost my memories,

227
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:01,599
but now that I remember
what my parents were like,

228
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,644
I don't feel any of that anymore.

229
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:24,205
- Sir.
- Yes?

230
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,376
Can I ask you something?

231
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:32,922
You scare me when you ask me
a question so seriously.

232
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,926
- When we went to Seoul last time,
- Yes?

233
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,055
the detectives of the RIU
seemed to know Detective Park.

234
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:42,140
Look.

235
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:44,851
He came from
the Regional Investigation Unit.

236
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:45,852
Yes.

237
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,562
They didn't end on good terms.

238
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,481
<i>He's a lone wolf.</i>

239
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,567
<i>He doesn't play office politics either.</i>

240
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,028
<i>So he can't bear to see</i>
<i>any corruption in the force.</i>

241
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,532
What are you doing?

242
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:01,409
Can't you see?

243
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,119
I'm working.

244
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,079
Kim Jin-ho
is under investigation right now.

245
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,916
We have evidence, a witness,
and the victim's testimony.

246
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:11,044
- So why on earth do we have a new suspect?
- Hey.

247
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,339
He turned himself in.

248
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,841
What's the problem?
The suspect turned himself in.

249
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:20,553
You're a scapegoat, aren't you?
Who hired you?

250
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,096
You crazy bastard.

251
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,057
You're the crazy one.

252
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:25,767
Have you lost your mind?

253
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,228
Why did you exclude
Kim Jin-ho from the list of suspects?

254
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,148
Because he's the mayor's son?

255
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:34,484
Did he say he'll promote you?

256
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,069
You crazy bastard!

257
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,696
You stuck-up bastard.

258
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,657
- Hey.
- Damn it.

259
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:42,951
You bastard.

260
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:45,161
- Come on, hit me.
- Come here.

261
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,372
- Damn it!
- Stop.

262
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:50,458
- Come here.
- I won't hit him.

263
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,793
- Hey.
- Hey, come here.

264
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:53,086
- You crazy bastard!
- Hey.

265
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,253
- Hey!
- Come here!

266
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:41,509
Would it be okay
if I record our conversation?

267
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:42,802
Sure.

268
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:46,556
Well...

269
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,851
It was 30 years ago,
so you may not remember clearly,

270
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,811
but please tell us what you remember.

271
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,105
I remember it clearly.

272
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,315
It's hard to forget such an incident.

273
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:08,703
No need to worry.

274
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,372
Dr. Choi Dong-eok passed away long ago,

275
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:14,751
and the case has passed
its statute of limitations.

276
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,586
The mother had dystocia.

277
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:19,964
We performed surgery on her,
but it didn't go well.

278
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,553
Actually, the person
who performed the surgery...

279
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,389
wasn't Dr. Choi.

280
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:29,974
Sorry?

281
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,226
Then who did?

282
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:35,104
Dr. Choi was busy that day as usual,

283
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,565
so an unlicensed doctor operated on her

284
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,692
and it led to an accident.

285
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:44,322
So Park Cheol-won's wife and child
both died because an unlicensed doctor

286
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:46,908
performed the surgery instead of Dr. Choi.

287
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:49,577
And that's why he came to the hospital,
holding a grudge against him?

288
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:53,915
Yes.

289
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:56,793
But I heard
he settled the case very quickly.

290
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,464
Actually, the victim was another child.

291
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:14,977
<i>Dr. Choi's child...</i>

292
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:17,105
<i>got injured.</i>

293
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:20,066
<i>And we all thought</i>
<i>things were going to get complicated.</i>

294
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:24,904
But...

295
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:29,700
I don't know what kind of settlement
Dr. Choi reached,

296
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:30,868
but things got quiet.

297
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:33,788
He saw his patients as usual,

298
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:37,667
and he stopped bringing
his daughter to the hospital.

299
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,794
Oh, it's a son.

300
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:42,004
Sorry?

301
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:46,092
Dr. Choi has one child, and he's a son.

302
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,220
You've seen the news, right?
The victim from the Youngin Murder Case.

303
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:52,306
That's Dr. Choi's son?

304
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:55,685
To summarize,

305
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,646
Park Cheol-won hurt Choi Jin-tae,

306
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:02,400
so he had to reach a settlement
regarding his wife and baby's death.

307
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:05,903
Yes.

308
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,200
Thank you for your cooperation. Goodbye.

309
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,289
Excuse me.

310
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:19,167
I'm sure it was a daughter.

311
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:20,877
Sorry?

312
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,338
I thought I wasn't remembering it clearly
as it's been a long time,

313
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:27,508
but I used to braid her hair
when she visited.

314
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:28,801
I'm sure it was a girl.

315
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:34,765
YOUNGIN POLICE STATION

316
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:39,729
I don't see any scars on his neck.

317
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,817
Maybe that nurse has it wrong.

318
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,904
But isn't it hard to misremember that?

319
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:49,363
It's the kid's gender we're talking about.

320
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,328
- Did you check?
- Yes, sir.

321
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,206
It was 30 years ago,
so they don't have any records of it.

322
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:01,584
But it was 1995 when Choi Dong-eok
registered Choi Jin-tae as his son.

323
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:02,877
It was 1995?

324
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,171
Let's see.

325
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,466
That means it was two years
after Park Cheol-won's knife incident.

326
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:11,636
He registered him two years
after he adopted Choi Jin-tae?

327
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:12,595
Anything else?

328
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:16,098
Besides that incident,
there aren't any medical malpractices.

329
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:19,060
Also, I checked Seo Hye-eun's whereabouts
on the day of the incident,

330
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:21,062
and she participated in a clinical trial

331
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:22,688
that's being conducted
at Hankook University Hospital.

332
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:23,814
Clinical trial?

333
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:25,358
- Yes, sir.
- Which one?

334
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,527
I couldn't find out which one.

335
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:31,948
The hospital wouldn't share
personal information about the patient.

336
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:45,753
How can I help you?

337
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,880
What room is Kim Hee-ae staying in?

338
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:49,799
May I ask who you are?

339
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:52,635
I'm her mom.

340
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:36,095
JUNE 5
SURGERY DATE

341
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,192
Come on now.

342
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:51,944
Stay still.

343
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:02,371
You're a crybaby, aren't you?

344
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:05,499
A crybaby? I was stabbed!

345
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,252
You better watch out.

346
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:11,339
If you do this again,
I won't let you off easy.

347
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:15,509
No need to be so aggressive.

348
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:17,595
Things will get sorted out now.

349
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:20,848
Thank you.

350
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:22,433
You're welcome.

351
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:34,195
What are you doing?

352
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:39,575
Look at that. English?

353
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:41,410
It's Russian.

354
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,287
You think everything is English.

355
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:46,540
It's Russian?

356
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,506
Is it fun?

357
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,925
You think life is only about having fun?

358
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:59,387
Sometimes you find meaning
in meaningless things.

359
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:03,015
If you're bored,
stop bothering me and read that.

360
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:06,394
- This?
- I'm not sure if you could though.

361
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:09,814
What's this?

362
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,315
They're all random letters.

363
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:15,945
Goodness, it's so nice out.

364
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:18,322
Let's go outside.

365
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:20,282
Don't you want to jump into the sea
when you look at it?

366
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:21,867
I'm not interested.

367
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:25,496
Whenever I came here,
I never left the premises.

368
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:28,040
Come on.
When you come to a place like this,

369
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:31,544
you should soak your feet in the water,
fish, and pick up sea shells.

370
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:34,422
Let's go!

371
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:35,923
At least soak your feet in the water.

372
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:37,591
Why would I do that?

373
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:39,885
If you want to take a shower,
do it in the bathroom.

374
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:41,429
Goodness.

375
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:44,765
Let's go outside! Please, okay?

376
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:47,101
You should get out
when you come to a place like this.

377
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:50,604
All right, let's go.

378
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:33,189
Gosh, this is nice.

379
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:36,066
How is it? It's nice to see
the sea up close, right?

380
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:37,651
It is.

381
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,906
It's my first time touching the sea.

382
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,329
I used to hate cold water.

383
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,165
But I think I'm starting to like it.

384
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:57,046
All right.

385
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:50,641
It's a relief though.

386
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:52,685
I don't know what's going on,

387
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:54,728
but the people here

388
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:57,189
seem to care a lot about you.

389
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,943
You really have no idea, do you?

390
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:04,405
An act of kindness always has a purpose.

391
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:07,199
They're all doing this for their benefit.

392
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:10,953
Just how old are you?

393
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,330
This doesn't come from experience,
but knowledge.

394
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:18,460
Dr. Mo Eun-sun's daughter
has a developmental disorder.

395
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:23,257
She has shown interest
since my dad started this research.

396
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,050
Really?

397
00:31:25,426 --> 00:31:27,469
If I become worthless
as a subject of the research,

398
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:29,763
I'll be worthless to her.

399
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,683
You and I both

400
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:35,978
can become worthless in a blink of an eye.

401
00:31:43,444 --> 00:31:45,362
What would you have done?

402
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,531
What do you mean?

403
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:49,992
Would you have...

404
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,120
told me the truth?

405
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,376
Would you tell me that I was
the subject of my dad's experiment

406
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:04,048
and an abused child...

407
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:06,675
who wasn't loved by her parents?

408
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:14,099
If I lose my memory again,

409
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:18,687
don't tell me anything.

410
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:23,901
Just keep lying the way you did...

411
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:27,363
by telling me you're my dad.

412
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,714
The director is coming to Korea.

413
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:49,218
He wants this sorted out before then.

414
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:50,803
What about the boat?

415
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:52,262
It's ready.

416
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:56,767
Let's make it tonight.

417
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:59,603
We should separate them
as soon as possible.

418
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:09,571
Mr. Park!

419
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:25,587
Do you have more questions to ask?

420
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:26,839
We met a nurse

421
00:33:27,131 --> 00:33:29,508
who worked with Dr. Choi Dong-eok
30 years ago.

422
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:34,680
We heard the story
between you and Dr. Choi Dong-eok.

423
00:33:44,148 --> 00:33:47,067
I told you everything about what I did
on the day of the incident.

424
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:50,529
We're curious about the story
from 30 years ago.

425
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,366
I heard that the knife you wielded
at the hospital

426
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:56,702
caused an injury to his child's neck.

427
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:04,460
What does that..

428
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:07,755
have to do with this case?

429
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,298
Because that child died.

430
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:17,765
It wasn't intentional.

431
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:21,018
I lost my mind
because I lost my wife and baby at once.

432
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:23,270
It was a wrong decision.

433
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:27,274
I have to be on my way. Goodbye.

434
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:32,654
You reached a settlement.

435
00:34:34,156 --> 00:34:35,949
Did you reach a settlement that quickly

436
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,868
because you hurt his child?

437
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:45,751
Because what I did was wrong.

438
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,171
Your wife and child lost their lives,

439
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:51,256
but Dr. Choi Dong-eok's son

440
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:54,134
lived 30 years without a scar on his neck.

441
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:57,262
He also had wealth and honor.

442
00:34:57,638 --> 00:34:59,181
Is that so wrong?

443
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,142
Does that child...

444
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,854
have to become unhappy like me?

445
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,444
Goodbye.

446
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,379
Do you think he would go that far
and kill the son?

447
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:33,006
I mean, the kid was injured
because of him.

448
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:36,760
It's not the son, but the daughter.

449
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,222
Why are things so confusing?

450
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:44,476
What's up?

451
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,146
<i>Jeong-man, a body was found</i>
<i>in the area Kim Myeong-jun lived in.</i>

452
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:58,407
Hello, sir.

453
00:35:58,657 --> 00:35:59,825
- This way.
- Okay.

454
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,493
Did we miss the body last time?

455
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:04,246
The body wasn't there
when we inspected the area last time.

456
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,914
I think it happened after that.

457
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,457
- After?
- Yes, sir.

458
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:09,668
- What about the victim?
- He's unidentified.

459
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:12,713
We found traces of him
being tied up on this side,

460
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,381
and his body was found here.

461
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:23,640
Hey.

462
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,392
He seems to be homeless in the area.

463
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:28,478
It seems like his right thigh
was stabbed by a knife.

464
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:30,814
The wound looks clean

465
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:33,942
as if it was done by a professional.

466
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:36,278
You're right.

467
00:36:36,904 --> 00:36:40,324
The stab wouldn't have been this clean
if he had resisted.

468
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:42,993
There are marks that show
that he was tied up.

469
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:51,001
Hello, sir.

470
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:53,295
- Hey.
- This way.

471
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:14,775
Jaden is coming to Korea today.

472
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,611
I think he's trying to take Ro-hee.

473
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,952
Ro-hee is the product of our investment!

474
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,912
We must protect her at all costs.

475
00:37:27,788 --> 00:37:29,122
Please help me.

476
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:33,210
I'll call you again.

477
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:39,424
Oh, please come in.

478
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:45,806
I heard it's today.

479
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:51,144
We prepared the safest route,
so don't worry.

480
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:52,396
I'm not worried,

481
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:55,816
but I don't know when I'll come back
if I leave now.

482
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:58,902
Oh, your daughter.

483
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:00,946
Yes.

484
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:02,656
I miss her,

485
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:06,785
and I think I'll feel a bit better
if I see her before I leave.

486
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:11,790
It won't be easy
since the police will be there,

487
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:13,959
but I'll find a way.

488
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,502
Really?

489
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:18,380
I told you.

490
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:22,426
We'll support you
and your daughter with everything.

491
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:23,719
Thank you.

492
00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:25,554
Thank you so much.

493
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:29,683
- Then I'll get going.
- Sure.

494
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:31,852
- Don't worry too much.
- Okay.

495
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:33,562
- All right.
- Thank you.

496
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:46,408
Okay, thank you.

497
00:38:50,037 --> 00:38:52,664
So they found the victim's blood
on the rope, but no fingerprints.

498
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,458
What about the CCTVs?

499
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:56,376
The area is being redeveloped,
so there are none.

500
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,504
They asked the shop owners
around the area, and they had no idea.

501
00:39:00,047 --> 00:39:02,382
Apparently, many people
come to collect junk.

502
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,271
There was one thing I didn't mention.

503
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,316
I thought it'd be the right thing
to tell you everything.

504
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:21,735
- Is it about that day?
- Yes.

505
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:26,531
Everyone kept it a secret,

506
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:30,786
but I thought it might be related
to the ongoing case.

507
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:34,372
I'm sure anything you tell me
would be of help.

508
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:39,169
Something happened around that time.

509
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:41,922
One of the mothers

510
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:44,633
was infected with AIDS.

511
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,427
AIDS?

512
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:48,720
Yes.

513
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:53,183
Dr. Choi poured his heart and soul
into his hospital.

514
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:56,353
He always said in the interviews
that he wanted

515
00:39:56,937 --> 00:39:59,231
to become an acknowledged
and respected doctor.

516
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:01,733
But he was shocked

517
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:05,112
when he heard
that one of the patients had AIDS

518
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:09,116
because people would stop coming
when they found out

519
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,951
that an AIDS patient visited his hospital.

520
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:12,369
But why is that a problem?

521
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:15,539
The object that the man
wielded wasn't a knife.

522
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:18,625
It was a blood-soaked scalpel
from that AIDS patient's room.

523
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:22,170
Everyone in the hospital

524
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:25,507
was worried that Dr. Choi's daughter

525
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,218
might get infected with AIDS.

526
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:31,805
Do you remember her name by any chance?

527
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:34,850
It's been too long, so I'm not sure.

528
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:41,565
It was Hye...

529
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,233
It was Hye something.

530
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:45,569
Hye...

531
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:48,363
Hye-eun?

532
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:51,700
Yes.

533
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:52,993
It was Hye-eun.

534
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,369
Choi Hye-eun.

535
00:40:57,581 --> 00:41:00,625
Also, I checked Seo Hye-eun's whereabouts
on the day of the incident,

536
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:02,627
and she participated in a clinical trial

537
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:04,254
that's being conducted
at Hankook University Hospital.

538
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,848
Come here.

539
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,391
Hey.

540
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:20,729
Hey, puppy.

541
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:46,004
Sir.

542
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:48,465
I went through the orphanage records.

543
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:49,382
And?

544
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:52,886
I think the child Choi Dong-eok adopted
was Seo Hye-eun.

545
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:56,723
CHILD INFORMATION
FEBRUARY 17, 1992: ADOPTED

546
00:41:57,933 --> 00:41:59,476
Do we still not know her whereabouts?

547
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,353
We have her number,
but she's not picking up.

548
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:03,480
Then get moving!

549
00:42:03,772 --> 00:42:04,898
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

550
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:06,274
Let's go.

551
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,497
{\an8}RESTRICTED NUMBER

552
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:22,791
Hello?

553
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:31,967
YOUNGIN HOSPITAL
DIRECTOR AND WIFE MURDER CASE

554
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:35,345
"A Brilliant Neurologist Dies."

555
00:42:35,512 --> 00:42:37,264
NO LEAD ON THE CULPRIT...

556
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:39,349
WHO'S THE SUSPECT?

557
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:44,771
"CCTVs Disabled."

558
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:46,731
CCTVS AROUND THE HOUSE WERE DISABLED
THE DAY BEFORE THE INCIDENT...

559
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:02,914
Ro-hee.

560
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:06,751
Listen, I...

561
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:13,008
Ro-hee?

562
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:22,726
<i>Yellow.</i>

563
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:24,352
<i>Yellow.</i>

564
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:27,147
Yellow siren lights.

565
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:29,316
What?

566
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:37,824
<i>It wasn't a police car.</i>

567
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:38,992
Do you remember?

568
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:41,745
That person is the culprit!

569
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:44,039
The security company worker!

570
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:45,415
What do I do now?

571
00:43:48,168 --> 00:43:50,128
Hold on.

572
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:53,048
- Let's get out.
- What?

573
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:55,050
Let's get out of here.

574
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,093
This isn't something
the two of us can solve.

575
00:43:57,344 --> 00:43:58,595
You remembered, right?

576
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:01,389
Now, we have to find people
who will help us.

577
00:44:01,598 --> 00:44:04,100
A cop isn't a culprit like we thought.

578
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:06,144
What will you do if we go to the cops?

579
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:07,937
I can't leave you here, can I?

580
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:09,689
How are you going to escape?

581
00:44:09,898 --> 00:44:10,774
Well, we can...

582
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,278
How are we going to escape?

583
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:18,448
You're going to do this
without a plan again?

584
00:44:19,366 --> 00:44:21,826
Do you think these people
will let me go easily?

585
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:27,624
I'm leaving this place today,

586
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:29,959
so I'll get help from the outside.

587
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:32,921
Do you think that'll be easy?

588
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:36,758
The moment you leave this place,
you'll fall in danger.

589
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:40,553
They'll smuggle you out of the country
after we say goodbye?

590
00:44:40,637 --> 00:44:42,263
That's only for me to hear

591
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:45,683
since I don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

592
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,604
But that doesn't mean
they can keep you alive.

593
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:54,734
This project has been conducted
under the highest level of security.

594
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:58,113
Without me,

595
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:01,366
you're worthless.

596
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:04,202
You're just subject to be removed.

597
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:06,079
Then what are we supposed to do?

598
00:45:09,249 --> 00:45:10,500
Seriously.

599
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,092
There's a broken 391 highway sign

600
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:22,846
at a place that's 1.2km away from here.

601
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:24,889
That's all I can remember.

602
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,643
When you leave,
I'll leave this place and hide there.

603
00:45:30,353 --> 00:45:31,771
You come find me.

604
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:39,112
<i>Your call cannot be...</i>

605
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:41,156
Jeez. Damn it.

606
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,365
Is she not picking up?

607
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:46,327
She's not picking up,
so I left a text message.

608
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,581
I think she's avoiding us on purpose.

609
00:45:50,874 --> 00:45:52,709
There must be a reason why.

610
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:01,759
Here's some food.

611
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:04,220
All right, let's see.

612
00:46:04,304 --> 00:46:06,306
I'll have the chocolate.

613
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:07,682
Anything for me.

614
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:08,892
Here you go.

615
00:46:12,729 --> 00:46:13,730
No.

616
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,316
- Are you not going to smoke?
- He's not.

617
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:17,984
Just smoke already.

618
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:21,696
I'm not going to, you brats.

619
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,803
Did you say your goodbye?

620
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,807
There's no need for that.
We weren't on good terms anyway.

621
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:53,436
Then shall we go?

622
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:16,626
Put that away.

623
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:20,004
There's no need to blindfold him.

624
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:23,341
Take care.

625
00:47:25,093 --> 00:47:27,303
I hope we can meet again with a smile.

626
00:48:01,004 --> 00:48:02,046
NATIONAL HIGHWAY
391

627
00:48:08,136 --> 00:48:12,181
Three hundred ninety-one.

628
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,063
Where are you going?

629
00:48:19,856 --> 00:48:22,859
She has to run some tests before surgery,

630
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:24,235
so she's going to the aseptic room.

631
00:48:24,694 --> 00:48:25,945
Okay.

632
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:36,706
CHILDREN'S WARD

633
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:00,832
Dad?

634
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,042
Hey.

635
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,211
Hey, Dad.

636
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:06,587
Hey, Hee-ae.

637
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:08,423
My baby.

638
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:10,258
Did you cry?

639
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,760
No.

640
00:50:14,387 --> 00:50:16,889
I forgot to wipe my face after washing.

641
00:50:17,974 --> 00:50:19,100
Liar.

642
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:24,939
Your surgery is next week.

643
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,482
Are you ready?

644
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:28,901
The doctors are the ones

645
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:32,029
who have to get ready, not me.

646
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:34,824
That's not true.

647
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:39,704
You have to eat well and be healthy
to get ready for surgery.

648
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:43,458
That way, the doctor will perform
the surgery well.

649
00:50:44,584 --> 00:50:47,420
By the way, where are you going?

650
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:50,882
Can't you stay with me

651
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:53,301
until the surgery?

652
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:55,803
I'm scared.

653
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:11,486
Hee-ae.

654
00:51:13,488 --> 00:51:15,573
You won't be sick
and won't have to come to the hospital

655
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,576
from now on.

656
00:51:21,621 --> 00:51:23,956
Listen to your mom, okay?

657
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,293
When you go back to school,

658
00:51:27,919 --> 00:51:30,755
have fun with your friends, okay?

659
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:33,257
Hee-ae.

660
00:51:35,176 --> 00:51:37,428
You're a kind and beautiful kid,

661
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,056
so you'll be fine, right?

662
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:43,017
Where are you going, Dad?

663
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:52,860
I'm going to make money for your surgery.

664
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:56,322
I'll come back with a lot of money,

665
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:59,283
so I can buy you everything you want.

666
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:01,661
Okay? I'll be back soon.

667
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:05,039
- Dad.
- Yes?

668
00:52:06,749 --> 00:52:08,167
Don't forget to get me a gift.

669
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:13,756
Of course not.

670
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:17,093
I won't forget.

671
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:22,181
I'll come back...

672
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:26,185
with your gift, okay?

673
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,604
I promise.

674
00:52:33,276 --> 00:52:35,611
I promise I'll come back.

675
00:52:36,863 --> 00:52:37,947
I promise.

676
00:53:04,432 --> 00:53:05,516
It's that boat.

677
00:53:05,975 --> 00:53:08,728
When you get to the border,
another boat will be waiting for you.

678
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:20,031
This will be enough for you to get by.

679
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:27,955
Gosh, how much is all this?

680
00:53:44,305 --> 00:53:45,306
Hey.

681
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:47,725
Listen.

682
00:53:48,893 --> 00:53:50,436
It'd be great if you could

683
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:53,230
put a doll next to Hee-ae
when she's done with her surgery.

684
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:54,815
Can you do that for me?

685
00:53:55,775 --> 00:53:56,817
We'll prepare it.

686
00:53:56,901 --> 00:53:58,986
Come on, it's more meaningful
when her dad buys her one.

687
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:02,198
Then again, this isn't my money.

688
00:54:04,617 --> 00:54:05,618
Here.

689
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:14,293
I'll get going.

690
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:47,470
Choi Ro-hee.

691
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:48,888
Ro-hee.

692
00:55:57,646 --> 00:55:59,690
Ro-hee's gone. Hurry!

693
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:54,620
You should sleep.
We have a long way to go.

694
00:56:54,829 --> 00:56:55,788
Let's go back.

695
00:56:55,955 --> 00:56:56,914
What?

696
00:56:59,667 --> 00:57:01,544
Give the money
you received to the captain.

697
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:02,920
Then tell him this.

698
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:05,714
When you get there,
just say that I disappeared.

699
00:57:06,257 --> 00:57:09,051
Just tell them I must've jumped
into the sea or something.

700
00:57:09,135 --> 00:57:10,427
Then nothing will happen.

701
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:14,348
That's not an easy favor to ask.

702
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:16,684
What if something unexpected happens?

703
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:26,443
You bastard.

704
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:27,129
<i>We'll have to deal with that on our own.</i>

705
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:31,926
It's been a while, Ro-hee.

706
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:25,604
{\an8}<i>You two tried to escape, didn't you?</i>

707
00:59:25,688 --> 00:59:26,855
{\an8}<i>You want to live as a runaway forever?</i>

708
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:29,733
{\an8}<i>If something happens to Mr. Kim,</i>

709
00:59:29,817 --> 00:59:31,610
{\an8}I won't let it slide.

710
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:33,737
{\an8}<i>Think of me as a money man</i>

711
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:35,781
{\an8}<i>who's investing huge amounts into Ro-hee.</i>

712
00:59:35,948 --> 00:59:38,909
{\an8}You people
only see this research as money.

713
00:59:39,368 --> 00:59:41,537
{\an8}We did all this for you.
You know that, right?

714
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:43,289
{\an8}<i>I won't go anywhere without him.</i>
