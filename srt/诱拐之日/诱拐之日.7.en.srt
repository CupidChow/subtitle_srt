00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,604
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS, GROUPS,

2
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,856
AND SETTINGS ARE FICTITIOUS,
AND CHILD SAFETY GUIDELINES WERE FOLLOWED

3
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:08,861
BASED ON THE NOVEL
THE DAY OF KIDNAPPING BY JEONG HAE-YEON

4
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:11,864
Go to the monitor room in the basement.

5
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:14,241
There's a landline phone
that can't be traced.

6
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,244
Dad used to make calls on it.

7
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,710
THIS IS KIM MYEONG-JUN...

8
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:31,008
RESTRICTED NUMBER

9
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:34,887
Hello?

10
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:35,971
This is Kim Myeong-jun.

11
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:37,556
Mr. Kim Myeong-jun?

12
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:38,891
I'm the kidnapper.

13
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,184
I have...

14
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,311
Ro-hee.

15
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:47,274
Please go on.

16
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:49,527
I'm calling to negotiate.

17
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:51,487
Negotiate?

18
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,113
Are you with her right now?

19
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,157
If you want to find her,

20
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,034
you'll need to prepare some money.

21
00:01:57,952 --> 00:01:58,994
Thirty billion won.

22
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:05,042
Hello? Are you listening?

23
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,877
Yes, please go on.

24
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:12,299
If you care about her safety,

25
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,177
liquidate all Ro-hee's family's assets--

26
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:16,720
Let me ask you again.

27
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:18,639
Are you with her right now?

28
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,099
Yes.

29
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:25,062
No! She's not with me.

30
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,106
Let me speak to her.

31
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:29,567
What do I do?

32
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,986
What do we do?

33
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:38,576
It's been a while, Mr. Choi.

34
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:41,203
No, I should call you
Attorney Choi, right?

35
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:42,705
Are you okay?

36
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,290
You sound fine.

37
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:46,208
I'm doing okay for a dead person.

38
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,711
But isn't this too obvious?

39
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,546
I'm talking about your clients.

40
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:52,381
I'm not sure.

41
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,884
This negotiation tactic

42
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:57,052
doesn't seem very wise either.

43
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:00,472
That's why I need your help.

44
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:05,102
Tell my great-uncle

45
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:09,481
that my kidnapper demanded ransom.

46
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:12,902
He'd better pay up,

47
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:17,573
or else I'll tell the world
that I'm still alive.

48
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:19,825
What do I gain?

49
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,795
CHAPTER 7. THE MOLE

50
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:33,255
Breaking news.

51
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:36,592
Along with the witness who claimed
to have seen

52
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,761
Choi Ro-hee's body
being thrown into the sea,

53
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:41,472
the police force is searching the waters

54
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,058
with more than a dozen divers.

55
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,685
But with the strong currents

56
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:49,271
and the fact that
it's the maritime boundary between China

57
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:51,649
are expected to cause difficulties
in the search.

58
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,817
Kim, the captain who witnessed the scene,

59
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:57,780
is fully cooperating
with the investigation.

60
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,324
Also, until the child's body is found,

61
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,118
he will provide his boat free of charge

62
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:06,497
and lead the police to the expected area
where the body was thrown.

63
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,959
We will come back with more updates.

64
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:14,296
I wired 300 million won
to all the crew members.

65
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:17,174
All right. Let's go get ours now.

66
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,058
By the way, is he trustworthy?

67
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,434
Who is he?

68
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:31,397
He used to be my homeschool teacher,

69
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,565
and he's an attorney now.

70
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:37,236
He's still on probation, but still.

71
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:42,741
Also, do you really think
I can trust someone right now?

72
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,493
I trust no one.

73
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,286
Does that include me?

74
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:49,748
I can't trust you for another reason.

75
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:54,461
What reason? What is it?

76
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,841
What's the reason?

77
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,010
Seriously.

78
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,763
But we're together.

79
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,640
How will we get the money?

80
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,229
Dr. Mo will help.

81
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:13,981
How do we trust her?

82
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,900
When Dad first started this project,

83
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,360
he didn't do it for money.

84
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:22,239
So he only received investments

85
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,450
from those who shared
the same vision as him.

86
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:27,870
Jaden, who only considers this
as part of making big money,

87
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:29,955
and Dr. Mo are different.

88
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:33,542
I'd be of help to Dr. Mo,

89
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,795
so she should help me too.

90
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,888
We still have some time left.
Why are you handing over the case?

91
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,848
Keep it down, will you?

92
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,600
You think I want to hand it over?

93
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:51,018
What?

94
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,145
This is from the highest
of the higher-ups.

95
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,189
How do you expect me
to go against their orders?

96
00:05:58,609 --> 00:05:59,943
No press conference.

97
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,695
End the case as quietly as possible.

98
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:02,863
No.

99
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,573
Park Sang-yun.

100
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:08,827
Kim Myeong-jun threw Choi Ro-hee
into the sea.

101
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,329
And the captain witnessed it!

102
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:12,998
How do we trust
a single witness's statement?

103
00:06:13,082 --> 00:06:15,042
Then do you believe
a kidnapper's statement?

104
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:25,469
Park Sang-yun.

105
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,846
Don't get all touchy over this.

106
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,766
It'll only cause us trouble.

107
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,352
Let's stick to our jobs, okay?

108
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,354
Let's wrap up the murder case

109
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,108
and get ourselves promoted, okay?

110
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:41,610
What is it?

111
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,196
Ms. Seo Hye-eun is here.

112
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,322
What?

113
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,868
Hey, Sang-yun!

114
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:51,995
Hey, you...

115
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:57,459
We're handing over the kidnapping case,
so get the paperwork ready.

116
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:58,919
-Sir.
-Come on.

117
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,087
Hurry up!

118
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,638
Hello.

119
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,560
I'm sorry.

120
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,896
I couldn't take your calls
due to personal engagements.

121
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,316
You've seen the news
about the murder, right?

122
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:23,777
Mr. Park Cheol-won

123
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:27,197
has been arrested as a suspect
in the murder of Dr. Choi Jin-tae.

124
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,035
I have some questions
regarding your relationship with him

125
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,912
so I called you in as a witness.

126
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:35,539
It's about you and him

127
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:38,000
since that day, 30 years ago.

128
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:43,297
I found out while looking into the case of
Mr. Park Cheol-won and Dr. Choi Dong-eok.

129
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:47,759
Back then,
Dr. Choi had an adopted daughter.

130
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,888
Where do you want me to begin?

131
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,434
Since the day he terminated my adoption?

132
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:57,728
Or...

133
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,200
since the day...

134
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:16,663
I got this scar?

135
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:21,043
-No!
-My goodness!

136
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,674
Nurse!

137
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,052
I was shocked.

138
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,429
But I couldn't even cry.

139
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,474
It's okay. You'll be fine.

140
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:38,518
I was worried
he might disown me for crying.

141
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:43,023
I held in my tears until the very end.

142
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,109
But even after the scar healed,

143
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,111
they didn't let me go home.

144
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,948
I was stuck there for about a year.

145
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,659
I later found out

146
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,953
that the scalpel Cheol-won
used to slash me

147
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,747
was used to operate on an AIDS patient

148
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:00,958
and the fact that

149
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,585
I was infected with AIDS.

150
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,380
Despite all this,

151
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:09,716
my dad, the leading authority
in gene therapy,

152
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,971
poured his heart and soul...

153
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:17,015
into treating me.

154
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,778
On the day I came home after treatment,

155
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,365
a boy that I'd never seen before

156
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,702
was in my room.

157
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,038
Who are you?

158
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,582
Me?

159
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:43,583
Park Jin...

160
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,003
I mean, Choi Jin-tae.

161
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:50,299
Who are you?

162
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:55,637
But...

163
00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:00,183
if Dr. Choi poured his heart and soul
to help you get better,

164
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,144
why did he disown you?

165
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,147
I...

166
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:10,986
didn't meet his expectations.

167
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,114
Dad, no...

168
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:17,784
Dr. Choi was conducting
an experiment he devoted all his life to,

169
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:20,704
but I didn't show the results...

170
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,290
he wanted.

171
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:24,875
An experiment?

172
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:30,589
Do you really think Choi Jin-tae and I

173
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:34,426
are the only ones Dr. Choi adopted?

174
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,053
Sorry?

175
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:40,849
I mean...

176
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,394
I'm amazed by the fact that
you were able to find me.

177
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,188
I'm sure there weren't any records.

178
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:51,526
Officially, Choi Jin-tae
is the only one he adopted.

179
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:53,612
But there are other kids...

180
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:57,657
who were adopted and disowned,
just like me.

181
00:10:58,617 --> 00:10:59,534
What do you mean?

182
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:02,954
Why would he repeatedly
adopt and disown the kids?

183
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,165
He wanted...

184
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:10,003
to amplify the brain's functions
through medical technology.

185
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:15,467
Did he conduct that experiment
on the children he adopted?

186
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:22,682
All the kids who didn't show progress
were disowned,

187
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:24,476
including me.

188
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:32,526
Then does that mean Choi Ro-hee
is also the victim of that experiment?

189
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,321
I don't know.

190
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:38,865
Do you really think he would've continued

191
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,785
such a cruel experiment until now?

192
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,789
Was Mr. Park Cheol-won
aware of these facts?

193
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,587
This isn't something you can share.

194
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,758
I only kept this to myself.

195
00:11:58,802 --> 00:11:59,928
Then tell me.

196
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,181
When did you meet Mr. Park again?

197
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:08,728
Cheol-won always felt sorry for me

198
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,065
because he thought I was disowned
because of him.

199
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,067
I also blamed him.

200
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,487
Whenever I wanted
to take it out on someone,

201
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,614
he always appeared.

202
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,493
He must've wanted repentance.

203
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,163
He sent me donations

204
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,124
until I graduated high school.

205
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,626
Have you kept in touch
with him since then?

206
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,378
After I graduated,

207
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,007
I thought our relationship
was finally over.

208
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:39,217
But...

209
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:43,930
the nightmare...

210
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:48,643
returned.

211
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,734
3 YEARS AGO

212
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,528
EXAMINATION RESULTS

213
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,655
HIV ANTIBODY

214
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:04,075
When I found out my HIV had relapsed,

215
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:08,830
I hated

216
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:10,749
and resented everything,

217
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,210
even my daughter.

218
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,810
When I was about to let everything go,

219
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,104
I heard a familiar name

220
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,732
on the news.

221
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:40,111
Dr. Choi Dong-eok, the pioneer
of gene therapy in Korea,

222
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:42,989
has passed away at the age of 83.

223
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:47,035
He devoted his life to gene therapy

224
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:50,372
and helped Korean medical technology
to take a big step forward.

225
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:53,833
The Korean Medical Association expressed
their condolences on their website

226
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:56,419
and stated a great star has fallen.

227
00:13:56,795 --> 00:14:00,882
His relatives
said that he passed away peacefully

228
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:02,717
without any illness or pain.

229
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,024
OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES

230
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,952
I don't know why I went there.

231
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:33,957
I just thought...

232
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,211
he was the first person I called "Dad,"

233
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:43,091
so I only intended to say
my final goodbye.

234
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:50,765
Hye-eun.

235
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,650
But coincidentally, I met him there...

236
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:03,695
again.

237
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,163
I'm sorry.

238
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,333
That's how my relationship with him...

239
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,461
started again.

240
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,296
How will I repent my sins?

241
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:24,049
Then...

242
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,509
did he take charge of the security

243
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,928
at Mr. Choi Jin-tae's house
because of you?

244
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,307
Do you think...

245
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:37,812
he did that because of me?

246
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,236
On the day he disabled
the CCTVs in Mr. Choi's house,

247
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,280
Mr. Park broke into his house

248
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,659
and murdered him
while attempting to commit robbery.

249
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,371
Have you contacted Mr. Park since then?

250
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,340
He hasn't contacted me in a while.

251
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:08,176
And I never contacted him first.

252
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:10,887
What about Mr. Kim Myeong-jun?

253
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,598
The next day,

254
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:17,727
Mr. Kim kidnapped Choi Ro-hee,
who was running out of the house.

255
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,522
And after being on the run with the kid
for some time,

256
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,025
he threw her body

257
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,153
into the sea near the maritime boundary

258
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,073
last night.

259
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:34,744
That can't be.

260
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,499
That can't be true. I can't believe it.

261
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,584
Oh, no.

262
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:43,378
Goodness.

263
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:44,963
Myeong-jun would never do that.

264
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,131
Myeong-jun...

265
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,926
isn't the type of person to kill someone,

266
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,302
especially kids.

267
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,638
It can't be true.

268
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,349
There must be something wrong.

269
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,936
Did you play a role

270
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,355
in kidnapping Choi Ro-hee?

271
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,901
No.

272
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,574
Where were you

273
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,161
on the 20th and 21st,
the day of the incident?

274
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,955
I was...

275
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:21,958
at the hospital...

276
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,838
for a clinical trial...

277
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,010
of the new medicine for AIDS.

278
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,813
Three people died
and a child was kidnapped.

279
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,149
I ask for your further cooperation.

280
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:50,195
If it's something
I can help you with, then sure.

281
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,114
One more thing.

282
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:58,119
If Dr. Choi Jin-tae continued
Dr. Choi Dong-eok's experiment,

283
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:00,121
would Mr. Kim Myeong-jun know

284
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,457
that Choi Ro-hee was a subject
of that experiment?

285
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:05,710
I'm not sure.

286
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,255
If I'm being frank,

287
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,300
Mr. Kim shows different characteristics
from normal kidnappers.

288
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,344
He protects and worries for the victim

289
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,387
and even requests help for her.

290
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,141
And if I'm being more frank,

291
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:24,896
I don't believe
that he kidnapped Choi Ro-hee.

292
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:28,983
Neither do I.

293
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:43,540
The evidence of child abuse
the nurse found on Choi Ro-hee last time

294
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,166
wasn't caused by Kim Myeong-jun.

295
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,877
She was being experimented on
by her dad, Dr. Choi Jin-tae.

296
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:50,880
STATEMENT

297
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,674
This experiment has been going on
since Dr. Choi Dong-eok

298
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:53,633
for the past 30 years.

299
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:56,386
NAME: SEO HYE-EUN

300
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:57,679
So?

301
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,474
What does that have to do
with this murder case?

302
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:05,395
Are you saying Park Cheol-won
took revenge on her behalf or something?

303
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,897
I'm talking about the kidnapping,
not the murder.

304
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,524
Come on, Park Sang-yun!

305
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,443
Let me dig deeper into this.

306
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,404
This isn't a crime committed for money.

307
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,447
He has no one to demand money from.

308
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:18,992
Then what is he after?

309
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,619
I think Kim Myeong-jun...

310
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,622
is being used.

311
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:27,709
By whom?

312
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:30,378
We'll have to find out.

313
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:43,808
Who are you?

314
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:47,061
I'm Dr. Choi Jin-tae's uncle.

315
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:49,272
This is a murder scene,
so you cannot enter.

316
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,608
I said I'm Dr. Choi Jin-tae's uncle!

317
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,192
I told you that you cannot enter.

318
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:54,903
What are you saying?

319
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,279
Hello, sir.

320
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:57,739
I received the call.

321
00:19:58,323 --> 00:19:59,324
Please enter.

322
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,321
Just as we promised,
you can have this house,

323
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:41,115
but all the research materials are mine.

324
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,159
What are you looking for?

325
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:46,746
It must be worth
more than Dr. Choi's assets.

326
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,331
I'm not sure.

327
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:50,959
Life is about making bets.

328
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:54,045
I don't know if it'll be
120 billion won or 1 200 won.

329
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:10,228
Go ahead.

330
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:13,106
Yes.

331
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:15,817
What?

332
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:19,153
What on earth are you saying?

333
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,115
Okay.

334
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:25,243
Are you sure?

335
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,914
They took the computer as well.

336
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,042
Okay.

337
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:36,838
All right.

338
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:52,687
Look.

339
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,024
Get out of this house.

340
00:21:57,859 --> 00:21:59,360
What the hell are you saying?

341
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:00,945
Get out right now!

342
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:05,700
He wants me to liquidate 30 billion won?

343
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,285
Yes, sir.

344
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:10,413
If you don't adhere to his demands,
he'll upload the evidence

345
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,123
that Ro-hee is alive on social media.

346
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:15,960
Did you record the call?

347
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:17,253
No, sir.

348
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,171
Wait.

349
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,381
Why did he call you?

350
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:22,592
I was Ro-hee's homeschool teacher
until last year.

351
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:24,135
He called me

352
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:26,387
after seeing that our law firm
represents Chairman Choi.

353
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:27,930
Ro-hee remembers my number.

354
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,016
But why 30 billion won?

355
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:33,728
The late Dr. Choi Jin-tae's savings
are presumed to be around 30 billion won.

356
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,774
He most likely asked for the said amount
since that's the amount you can liquidate.

357
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,360
How could you
take care of things like this?

358
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:42,820
What will you do now?

359
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:45,323
Do you even know where Ro-hee is?

360
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:52,622
The kidnapper called you himself?

361
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,794
-Yes.
-What was his voice like?

362
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,504
Quite calm.

363
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:03,382
And it was a woman.

364
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:06,177
A woman? You said the kidnapper is a man.

365
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:08,012
And that's what the news said!

366
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:09,764
The one I spoke to was a woman.

367
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:12,266
Interesting.

368
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,062
Listen,

369
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:18,356
Attorney Choi.

370
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:19,941
Is it true?

371
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,151
What is?

372
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:23,986
The kidnapper who called you.

373
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,115
Was it really a woman?

374
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:32,537
Yes.

375
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,497
It was a woman.

376
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:38,668
Damn it.

377
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:41,170
I can't read your expression.

378
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,257
A woman with a calm voice.

379
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:45,800
A woman?

380
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:49,720
It's been revealed on the news
that it's a man.

381
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,098
You think he'll believe that?

382
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:53,474
We'll have to see

383
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:55,268
whether he believes you or not.

384
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,770
If this goes well,

385
00:23:57,854 --> 00:24:00,273
you'll be my legal representative

386
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:01,941
and appointed as guardian of my estate.

387
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,777
That sounds burdensome.

388
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:14,704
Are the police showing any movements?

389
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,372
Not yet, sir.

390
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:19,959
But there's a piece of information
we've overlooked.

391
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,627
It's about Kim Myeong-jun.

392
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:32,513
SUSPECT OF YOUNGIN HOSPITAL
DIRECTOR AND WIFE MURDER CASE ARRESTED

393
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,473
Is the Internet back on?

394
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:36,642
Yes.

395
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:39,562
I enabled tethering
on Dr. Mo's phone earlier.

396
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:40,646
What?

397
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,190
What if you get caught?

398
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:45,818
I'm sure she noticed already.

399
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,404
But seeing how she hasn't turned it off,

400
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,656
I guess we silently agreed to leave it on.

401
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:53,534
Goodness, whatever.

402
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:55,161
Why are things so complicated?

403
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,039
You know, they say,

404
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,666
"You can never know

405
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,295
what a person is really planning."

406
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:08,925
You mean, "You can never know
what a person is really thinking."

407
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,803
Whatever. Same thing.

408
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:17,141
Anyway, did you look up
everything you wanted?

409
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:18,434
No.

410
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:22,271
I read the articles
hoping that I remember something,

411
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:23,981
but I got nothing.

412
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:25,233
Remember what?

413
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:29,737
If I see something once,
I never forget it.

414
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:35,743
But it took me a long time
to remember the siren lights.

415
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:39,872
You recovered most of your memory.

416
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,415
That's true.

417
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:45,878
But my memory from that day
isn't coming back to me.

418
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:50,633
There were two drugs my so-called dad
injected during the experiments.

419
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:54,387
One stimulates the hippocampus,

420
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,306
and the other relaxes the body.

421
00:25:57,807 --> 00:26:00,476
I always felt the same after I woke up.

422
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:03,104
And I always remembered
what happened before the experiment.

423
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:06,023
But not this time.

424
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:10,152
I've never had a case
where my memory was hazy.

425
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,321
I think...

426
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:15,574
another type of drug was injected
into my body that day,

427
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:19,328
looking at how hazy my memory is.

428
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:26,085
But...

429
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:29,714
isn't it a good thing
not to remember bad memories?

430
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:33,634
Usually, the most painful memories
last the longest.

431
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:37,263
You scare me
whenever you say stuff like that.

432
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:38,848
Why?

433
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:42,268
My greatest fear is people
who become weird all of a sudden.

434
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:44,895
My greatest fear is you.

435
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:47,106
Goodness.

436
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:49,483
Anyway,

437
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:51,736
I'm hungry.

438
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,195
Aren't they going to feed us?

439
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:55,990
I've heard this line somewhere.

440
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:58,659
You're not imitating me, are you?

441
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:00,995
I am.

442
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,915
This is new. You hate skipping meals.

443
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,084
I don't know.

444
00:27:07,752 --> 00:27:09,378
I don't have an appetite these days.

445
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:12,214
Maybe it's because
my useless memories are back.

446
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:16,469
It should be about 8 p.m.

447
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:18,763
Yes.

448
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:28,272
Eat this if you're hungry.

449
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:39,116
Did you know I was listening in on you?

450
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:43,245
I thought you might be listening.

451
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:45,706
And...

452
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:48,626
that you might know
I looked through your phone.

453
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:51,295
Just assumptions.

454
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:53,714
You know

455
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:56,801
that the moment
I go to Singapore with Jaden,

456
00:27:57,885 --> 00:28:01,222
your daughter
won't be part of this project anymore.

457
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:05,851
That doesn't mean
I can stop you from going.

458
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:09,772
Without Dr. Choi,

459
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:13,609
Jaden holds the most shares
of this project.

460
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:16,654
You don't want me to go
with Jaden, do you?

461
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:18,614
Ro-hee.

462
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,660
Do you think I can trust you right now?

463
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:27,039
I don't trust you either.

464
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,499
But what else can I do?

465
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,962
We only have each other
to trust right now.

466
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:37,800
For the sake of both you and me,

467
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:44,181
isn't the solution to all this
having my memories fully recovered?

468
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:48,978
Are your memories all back?

469
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:50,688
Only I can confirm...

470
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:54,900
whether I have regained them or not.

471
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:10,124
What a way to make an entrance,
you bastards.

472
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:19,550
What are you doing?

473
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:22,595
Get up.

474
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:32,563
I should've asked this sooner.

475
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:35,149
Who are you?

476
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:37,151
Don't you know me?

477
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,447
My name is Kim Myeong-jun, you bastard.

478
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:46,744
Jaden!

479
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:47,995
Ro-hee, no.

480
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:07,515
Let me ask you again.

481
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:10,559
Is there an accomplice
in this kidnapping case?

482
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:12,686
What?

483
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,773
I should've taken care of this earlier.

484
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:18,567
Your ex-wife went to the police today.

485
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,363
A woman demanded ransom
before she was investigated.

486
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:23,614
So what?

487
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,784
I was stuck here all day

488
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:28,702
without a phone or a way to communicate.

489
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:32,164
So why are you taking this out on me,
you crazy bastard?!

490
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:40,005
It was in the basement.

491
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:49,723
You son of a bitch!

492
00:30:58,065 --> 00:30:58,983
Did you call him?

493
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:01,485
Or did you tell Seo Hye-eun
to demand money?

494
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,696
What the hell are you saying?

495
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:05,906
She's behind all this,
and you're just her pawn, right?

496
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:10,035
I did all this by myself.

497
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:12,246
Happy?

498
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:15,624
Seo Hye-eun was acquainted
with Dr. Choi's murderer for a long time.

499
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:19,003
She knew all about the project
since Dr. Choi Dong-eok's time.

500
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,963
Were you after Choi Ro-hee as well?

501
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:22,590
Is that why you killed them?

502
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:24,550
Is this true?

503
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:27,595
I don't know about the murder,

504
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:31,390
but I'm the one who planned,
kidnapped her,

505
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:33,142
-and--
-Cut the bullshit!

506
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:37,855
Hye-eun has nothing to do with this.

507
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,773
I did this all by myself.

508
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:44,028
I'm asking this for the last time.

509
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,071
Did Seo Hye-eun tell you to do this?

510
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:51,577
Why are you keeping quiet like an idiot?

511
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,954
Stay quiet, Ro-hee.

512
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,415
She told him to do it.

513
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:57,458
Ro-hee!

514
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:58,542
Shut up.

515
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,628
Do you want a bullet through your head?

516
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:04,465
Look at his face.

517
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,175
He won't think twice about shooting you.

518
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,260
All right.
Then let's have the genius girl talk.

519
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:10,387
You think this stupid man did all this?

520
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,265
His wife, who ran away years ago,
suggested he should kidnap me

521
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:15,684
to make money for his daughter's surgery.

522
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,771
That's why he had no choice
but to kidnap me.

523
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:22,316
But when things got complicated,
she backed out.

524
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,776
Stop it!

525
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:25,653
I told you

526
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,864
she needs to look after Hee-ae!

527
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,575
Then you want me to stay quiet
when you're about to die?

528
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:32,993
Quiet!

529
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,083
What if the person who demanded the money

530
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:41,460
was Seo Hye-eun?

531
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:43,754
You...

532
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:46,465
Don't you dare touch Hye-eun.

533
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:49,843
I won't let it slide.

534
00:32:59,228 --> 00:33:00,729
Mr. Kidnapper.

535
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:02,439
It won't be suspicious

536
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:05,359
for you to die at any moment.

537
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:08,946
Don't act tough unless you want to die.

538
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:23,752
I won't let anyone who interferes
with my business off easily.

539
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:40,811
Acquainted with?

540
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:43,105
What kind of acquaintance?

541
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:45,691
The murderer and the lady.

542
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:50,988
I really don't know.

543
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:55,659
She's known him for 30 years
since she was young.

544
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:58,996
They've known each other
far longer than I've been alive.

545
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:00,664
How could you not know?

546
00:34:05,753 --> 00:34:08,338
The security company worker
is in his fifties.

547
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:11,133
Maybe they had an affair.

548
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:13,510
Are you serious?

549
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:15,179
It's strange

550
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:20,142
that the security company worker
and your wife are acquainted.

551
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:25,105
But how did he know?

552
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:26,982
What do you mean?

553
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:29,026
He knew about Hye-eun's questioning.

554
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:31,779
That crazy bastard
even knew the details of it.

555
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,366
There must be a mole.

556
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,830
That might be for the best.

557
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:47,044
If the cops have their eyes on the lady,
they can't harm her.

558
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,259
Where are you going?

559
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,348
Do I have to be held captive too?

560
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,768
I mean, you have a family,
so you should go home.

561
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,729
Was your daughter's name Byeol?

562
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:16,073
Don't you dare say her name.

563
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:21,703
It may seem like we have different goals,

564
00:35:22,663 --> 00:35:25,249
but in the end, our goals will align.

565
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:28,752
If you succeed, I'll make money,

566
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:32,297
and you'll be able
to make your daughter healthy.

567
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:37,636
Byeol should become like Ro-hee.

568
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:40,931
But not an orphan.

569
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:44,476
She should be a girl with a happy family.

570
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,334
Hello.

571
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:10,961
How was today?

572
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:12,379
Good.

573
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:13,714
I'll get going then.

574
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:15,424
-Thank you for your work.
-Goodbye.

575
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,126
It's Seo Hye-eun.

576
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:57,466
Hold on.

577
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,179
-It's the cops.
-What?

578
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:04,556
That black van.

579
00:37:08,352 --> 00:37:09,478
Damn it.

580
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,903
-Ju-hyeok.
-Sir, Ms. Seo is going to work.

581
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,363
You bored?

582
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:22,032
It's only the first day, so I'm fine.

583
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,035
The longer you endure,
the better results you'll get.

584
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:26,453
Keep up the good work.

585
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:27,746
Okay.

586
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:33,126
There's surprisingly
a lot of people here still.

587
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:36,129
This is the only big hospital in the area.

588
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:40,258
Was there anything odd
about Dr. Yoon recently?

589
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:44,221
Not recently.

590
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,181
He was just as usual.

591
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,433
What was he like usually?

592
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:51,979
Just a bit talkative.

593
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:53,397
Talkative?

594
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:57,484
I don't want to talk badly
about the deceased,

595
00:37:58,151 --> 00:37:59,987
but he was quite talkative.

596
00:38:00,237 --> 00:38:02,614
What do you mean by that?

597
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:06,868
He liked to gossip.

598
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:10,747
Talking behind people's backs
and things along those lines.

599
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:14,501
So he wasn't well-received
by the employees here.

600
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,253
She's right.

601
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:20,465
In the end,
no one wanted to hang out with him,

602
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:23,176
so he always waited
for that security company worker

603
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:27,014
and would smoke and have coffee together.

604
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:30,183
What were the topics of his gossip?

605
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:32,436
There were so many.

606
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:36,356
He'd talk about a failed blind date
of another person

607
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:39,443
or a secret affair
between a doctor and nurse.

608
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,028
Things like that.

609
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:49,119
Anything else you'd like to add?

610
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:54,374
He also gossiped about Dr. Choi.

611
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:58,128
He said Dr. Choi was having
trouble with his wife

612
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:01,298
and that he was having an affair.

613
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,968
But we didn't believe him.
After all, it was Dr. Choi.

614
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:07,429
She's right.

615
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,752
Hello, this is Attorney Choi Taek-gyun.

616
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:40,212
Any progress?

617
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,547
The kidnapper sent me a video.

618
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:48,678
Keep a close eye
on Kim Myeong-jun and Seo Hye-eun.

619
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:49,930
Yes, sir.

620
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,849
Dr. Mo Eun-sun as well.

621
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:01,775
I'm probably better than you
at this scrape-the-sand game.

622
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:06,905
You shouldn't call this a game
when it's this boring.

623
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:08,281
I'm getting sleepy.

624
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:11,743
It is indeed a great time to nap.

625
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:17,541
I think it's around 2 p.m.

626
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:21,878
Hey!

627
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:49,823
This is from last night.

628
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:51,116
Where is this?

629
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,742
A safe place that no one knows.

630
00:40:52,826 --> 00:40:54,911
How can someone take this video
if no one knows?

631
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:57,247
Sir.

632
00:40:58,165 --> 00:41:00,667
Just sit back if you don't want to
get bitten by a crazy bastard.

633
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:02,669
I'll take care of it.

634
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:06,548
How did they send this?

635
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:08,258
Through email.

636
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,220
I looked into it,

637
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:15,432
and it's a pornography website email
serviced in Eastern Europe.

638
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:16,683
They're quite meticulous,

639
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:20,020
looking at how they used
an email we can't trace.

640
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:29,154
-Next patient.
-Yes.

641
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:30,322
The doctor will see you.

642
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:33,909
Dr. Mo is meeting with patients.

643
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:36,077
Is that why?

644
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:38,872
You should try to relax more.

645
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:47,756
Sir, Ms. Seo came outside.

646
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,425
I'll go. I was about to go
to the bathroom anyway.

647
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:54,763
Seo Hye-eun disappeared
behind the building.

648
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:56,181
There are cops nearby.

649
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:58,225
Don't cause a scene and find her.

650
00:41:58,350 --> 00:41:59,351
Yes, sir.

651
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:02,145
Seo Hye-eun disappeared.

652
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:03,647
Damn it.

653
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:09,986
INTERNATIONAL CALL

654
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:26,753
SPEAKER

655
00:42:26,962 --> 00:42:27,879
Hello?

656
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:29,965
This is Choi Taek-gyun.
Go ahead and speak.

657
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,424
Is everyone there?

658
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:34,511
Well...

659
00:42:34,928 --> 00:42:36,805
Yes, we're all here. Go on.

660
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:40,809
I called to tell you the location
and the time to drop off the money.

661
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:45,397
You're demanding 30 billion won
for an 11-year-old girl?

662
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,732
Isn't that too much?

663
00:42:47,983 --> 00:42:51,861
I'm sure you know better than me
that 30 billion won is cheap

664
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:54,447
considering her value.

665
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:00,495
If you fill up a 100L trash bag

666
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:04,291
with 50 000-won bills,
it'll be 1.5 billion won.

667
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,962
There are five trash disposal areas

668
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:12,424
in Singil-ro between Ujeong Supermarket
and the alley.

669
00:43:13,008 --> 00:43:14,676
Place four bags in each area,

670
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:18,346
20 trash bags total.

671
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:21,766
You have until midnight tomorrow.

672
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:25,353
It's impossible

673
00:43:25,437 --> 00:43:28,440
to withdraw 30 billion won in cash
by that time.

674
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:30,984
That's none of my business.

675
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:40,452
We found Seo Hye-eun.

676
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,705
What about Ro-hee?

677
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:45,832
How will we make the exchange?

678
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:54,090
Who are you?

679
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:55,550
May I see your phone?

680
00:43:57,927 --> 00:43:59,387
I said who are you?

681
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:06,811
Goodness.

682
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:12,776
After I check the amount,
I'll drop her off in front of her house.

683
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,699
Could you let us through?

684
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:23,787
Excuse me.

685
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:29,459
Are we breaking off the deal?

686
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,045
Why aren't you talking?

687
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:34,506
Shall we stop here?

688
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:44,099
This is interesting.

689
00:44:44,808 --> 00:44:46,434
No, I was just thinking

690
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:49,354
what you would do...

691
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:51,439
if I don't accept your demand.

692
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:53,858
Let me send you a link via email.

693
00:44:53,942 --> 00:44:56,403
SENDER: UNKNOWN

694
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,074
THE KIDNAPPED RO-HEE IS ALIVE.
VIDEO OF RO-HEE LAST NIGHT!

695
00:45:02,242 --> 00:45:04,452
"Ro-hee's Great-uncle attempted

696
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:06,287
to fabricate her death."

697
00:45:06,496 --> 00:45:09,541
Of course, I'm sure
you're the one who bribed the captain.

698
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:13,294
"Why is X Capital,
a private equity fund in Singapore,

699
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:15,964
so obsessed with this girl?"

700
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:17,841
People would get curious.

701
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:21,094
I'm sure 30 billion won
is a cheap price to pay

702
00:45:21,428 --> 00:45:22,887
to settle the impending backlash.

703
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:24,514
Hurry up and decide.

704
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,141
The views are going up.

705
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:28,268
VIEWS: 4

706
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:32,480
Okay.

707
00:45:32,939 --> 00:45:34,149
THE VIDEO CANNOT BE PLAYED

708
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:37,652
Are you with Choi Ro-hee right now?

709
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:39,279
Great-uncle!

710
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:42,115
-Please help me!
-What's going on?

711
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:43,908
-Please save me!
-What on earth are you doing?

712
00:45:43,992 --> 00:45:45,910
Let go of me!

713
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:47,245
Where's Ro-hee?

714
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:48,955
He's with Kim Myeong-jun.

715
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,083
Let me go!

716
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:53,626
Great-uncle!

717
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,044
Great-uncle!

718
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:58,214
Let me go!

719
00:45:58,298 --> 00:45:59,466
Great-uncle!

720
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:02,385
Please help me!

721
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:11,436
I'll call you after I check the money.

722
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:25,992
Do you feel better?

723
00:46:30,205 --> 00:46:31,498
You're getting pretty good.

724
00:46:31,581 --> 00:46:32,874
It's getting fun.

725
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:47,222
Why can't you do your job?

726
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:51,184
I did everything you asked of me.

727
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:52,936
I convinced the higher-ups

728
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:54,437
and impeded the investigation.

729
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:57,524
You mess this up
after taking advantage of me?

730
00:46:58,191 --> 00:46:59,359
How will you take care of this?

731
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:01,861
We even told the public that she's dead!

732
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:04,113
How will you clean this mess up?

733
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:08,701
Mr. Choi.

734
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:11,704
As you said, the public thinks she's dead,

735
00:47:11,788 --> 00:47:14,791
so we have to take care of this
no matter what.

736
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:17,168
Getting upset won't get us anywhere.

737
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:22,257
We should put
our heads together and think.

738
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:25,134
All meaningful fruition
goes through adversities and--

739
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:32,183
You arrogant bastard.

740
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:33,893
How dare you patronize me?

741
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,313
Who the hell do you think you are?

742
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:42,694
Call the press and tell them she's alive.

743
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:44,487
Yes, sir.

744
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:47,824
No, I'll meet the chief of police myself.

745
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:50,034
I understand.

746
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:52,996
Take a seat, sir.

747
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:57,166
Please calm yourself first.

748
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,043
What the hell do you think you're doing?

749
00:48:05,717 --> 00:48:07,802
You fucking nasty old geezer!

750
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,637
Who do you think you are to teach me?

751
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:13,308
Hey, I told you I'll take care of it!

752
00:48:14,434 --> 00:48:16,185
I'll give you everything you want.

753
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:18,771
So let's cut the bullshit

754
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:22,108
and think about how to liquidate
30 billion won by tomorrow.

755
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:25,028
Let's put

756
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:28,197
our heads together, okay?

757
00:48:28,865 --> 00:48:31,576
You fucking old geezer.

758
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:42,962
Let me search you first.

759
00:48:45,173 --> 00:48:46,549
Goodness.

760
00:48:52,764 --> 00:48:55,391
Jeez, I've got nothing.

761
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:58,686
Gosh.

762
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:06,319
I'll see you at dinner.

763
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:08,655
You can't leave the room today.

764
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,698
Why not? You won't feed me?

765
00:49:10,782 --> 00:49:11,991
It's the director's orders.

766
00:49:12,075 --> 00:49:13,660
I'll give you lunch boxes.

767
00:49:13,785 --> 00:49:15,370
What? Lunch boxes?

768
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:19,540
Jeez, they treated me better
back in prison.

769
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,223
Lock the door.

770
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:42,605
I got some money from the CEO
of a private equity fund in Hong Kong.

771
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:46,067
I went to great lengths to get this money,

772
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:48,111
so can you trust me now?

773
00:49:48,945 --> 00:49:50,238
Let me ask you one thing.

774
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:52,365
Are you sure...

775
00:49:53,366 --> 00:49:54,826
you have Choi Ro-hee?

776
00:49:59,372 --> 00:50:00,540
I'm not sure.

777
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,128
What will you do if things go wrong?

778
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:10,049
I never bet on something I'd lose on.

779
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:13,928
But I promise you this.

780
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:15,596
If things go wrong,

781
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,307
I'll bring Choi Ro-hee's body to you.

782
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:36,367
Ms. Seo came home at 9:20 p.m.

783
00:50:36,451 --> 00:50:37,368
Yes, sir.

784
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:40,413
"Ms. Seo came home at 9:20 p.m."

785
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:43,166
We'll take turns sleeping.
I'll sleep first.

786
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:44,333
Yes, sir.

787
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:01,934
Did she meet anyone in particular?

788
00:51:02,018 --> 00:51:05,104
I don't know if she's caught on,
but she only goes to work and home.

789
00:51:05,354 --> 00:51:07,023
Gosh, I guess she doesn't even
have friends.

790
00:51:07,607 --> 00:51:08,649
How did she seem?

791
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:09,901
Calm.

792
00:51:10,193 --> 00:51:13,237
I think she's shocked
due to Park Cheol-won's murder

793
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:17,074
and Kim Myeong-jun's kidnapping.

794
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:29,337
Sir, there's a black sedan
at my 11 o'clock.

795
00:51:35,927 --> 00:51:37,386
-Tailing us?
-Yes, sir.

796
00:51:37,887 --> 00:51:39,305
I saw them yesterday afternoon.

797
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:42,517
They've been tailing Ms. Seo
since yesterday.

798
00:51:42,809 --> 00:51:43,768
Did you look up the vehicle?

799
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:46,646
It's an unlicensed car.
I was about to arrest them but didn't.

800
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:47,897
I'll keep an eye on them for now.

801
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:58,741
Give this to Mr. Kim.

802
00:51:58,825 --> 00:52:00,034
I have no appetite.

803
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:03,246
He eats two portions a meal.

804
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,500
Why?

805
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:08,918
You think I poisoned the food?

806
00:52:10,086 --> 00:52:11,295
Try it then.

807
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,228
What? I get an extra?

808
00:52:27,562 --> 00:52:28,938
That's good. I wasn't full.

809
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,148
You're fattening me up!

810
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:03,723
YOUNGIN POLICE STATION
LIEUTENANT PARK SANG-YUN

811
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:19,113
Kim Myeong-jun is locked up in his room.

812
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:20,573
We're constantly checking in.

813
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:22,950
And Seo Hye-eun returned home.

814
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:30,207
What about Dr. Mo?

815
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:31,709
She went home after work.

816
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:33,294
She'll be coming to the villa tomorrow.

817
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:37,506
Gather all our men at the villa.

818
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:39,926
Capture that kidnapper

819
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:41,636
at all costs.

820
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:48,517
Would it be okay to reduce
the number of men guarding Kim Myeong-jun?

821
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:50,061
What's the point of having guns?

822
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:51,687
Shoot him if things go awry.

823
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:51,205
Dr. Mo Eun-sun.

824
00:55:25,573 --> 00:55:28,284
GARBAGE DISPOSAL VEHICLE

825
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,025
He's moving to area three.

826
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:02,651
Block the truck in front of area four.

827
00:56:03,319 --> 00:56:04,320
Yes, sir.

828
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:07,740
Area four, block the truck.

829
00:56:21,337 --> 00:56:22,588
Get ready to leave.

830
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:40,940
What's the noise?

831
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:51,492
Open the door.

832
00:57:10,845 --> 00:57:13,264
Kim Myeong-jun, don't do anything stupid.

833
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:55,055
Ro-hee.

834
00:58:50,069 --> 00:58:51,153
Get out.

835
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:54,990
Get out, you bastard!

836
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:41,620
I finally found you, you damn mole.

837
00:59:50,963 --> 00:59:51,964
Stop.

838
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:56,093
Get out.

839
00:59:56,885 --> 00:59:58,137
Get out, you bastard!

840
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:20,617
Drop your weapon.

841
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:28,375
I'm a cop.

842
01:01:16,465 --> 01:01:18,926
You think getting rid of me
will be the end of this?

843
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:20,094
Is this the right thing to do?

844
01:01:20,344 --> 01:01:22,012
Things might get more dangerous
for Ro-hee.

845
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:25,265
Ro-hee isn't a subject
of an experiment anymore.

846
01:01:26,475 --> 01:01:27,309
What are you doing?!

847
01:01:27,393 --> 01:01:28,811
The warrant was rejected.

848
01:01:29,061 --> 01:01:31,146
Today is Kim Myeong-jun's
daughter's surgery.

849
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:32,648
I'll make sure to bring them in today.

850
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:34,441
I'll end everything today.

851
01:01:35,567 --> 01:01:36,777
Where's Choi Ro-hee?

852
01:01:37,778 --> 01:01:38,862
Mom!

853
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:40,531
Where are they?

854
01:01:41,782 --> 01:01:43,367
What is Choi Ro-hee to you?

855
01:01:43,492 --> 01:01:45,828
Why are you throwing yourself
to protect her?

856
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:49,748
Ro-hee will live
as an ordinary 11-year-old girl.

857
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:52,835
That's the only thing I can do
as her kidnapper.

858
01:01:53,127 --> 01:01:54,378
No!

859
01:01:55,254 --> 01:01:56,255
Ro-hee!
