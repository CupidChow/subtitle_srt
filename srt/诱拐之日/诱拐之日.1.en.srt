00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:19,246
- Your treatment is done for today.
- I see.

8
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:22,416
- You don't need to be hospitalized.
- Ms. Kim Yeong-hui.

9
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:25,711
You only got
one medication prescribed, and...

10
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:29,757
- This is wonderful.
- It is.

11
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:41,143
- Hello, doctor.
- Hello, doctor.

12
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:42,436
Have you been well?

13
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:47,525
- Is she your daughter?
- Yes, she's my daughter.

14
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,235
She's so pretty.

15
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,407
- Are you here to see your dad?
- Yes.

16
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:56,534
Bye.

17
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,619
- All right. Keep up the good work.
- Thank you.

18
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:00,371
Let's go.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,044
Goodness, look how pretty you are.

20
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,547
We prepared some snacks

21
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,799
for the little lady here.

22
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,467
- Goodness.
- This way, please.

23
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:36,699
- Die!
- No!

24
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:38,492
No!

25
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:40,411
- Someone call the police!
- Hurry!

26
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,830
Call the police!

27
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:44,540
Call the police!

28
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:48,711
- Let go! You two!
- Run away!

29
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,129
Security!

30
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,434
Hey!

31
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:41,221
Die!

32
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,120
Oh, no.

33
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,748
Oh, no. Someone call the police.

34
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,293
No!

35
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:12,753
No...

36
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:15,214
What are you doing?

37
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,091
Hurry up and call the police!

38
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,426
You bastard!

39
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,011
You crazy bastard!

47
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,700
- Hey, why did you call?
- <i>Did you arrive?</i>

48
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,243
I arrived a while ago.

49
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,870
You said to move with your cue.

50
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:30,289
<i>You're well hidden</i>
<i>in a remote place, right?</i>

51
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,582
What?

52
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,875
Of course.

53
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,836
But I'm going in at this hour?

54
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,838
Are you sure this is okay?

55
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,299
<i>Yes. I'll give you a sign</i>
<i>when the timing is right.</i>

56
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,468
But it's over 11...

57
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:45,596
What?

58
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:46,805
<i>What is it?</i>

59
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,683
Damn it.

60
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:50,934
<i>What? What's going on?</i>

61
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,937
Hang on.

62
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:55,773
<i>What's happening?</i>

63
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,443
<i>Damn it. What's going on, Myeong-jun?</i>

64
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,197
<i>Hello? Myeong-jun.</i>

65
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,407
Gosh, this again?

66
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:07,159
<i>Kim Myeong-jun. What's happening?</i>

67
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,410
Sir, get up.

68
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:10,788
Hang up for now.

69
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:28,722
Damn it.

70
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,224
What is it again?

71
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,892
<i>What do you mean?</i>

72
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,936
<i>You suddenly hung up on me.</i>

73
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:36,355
I wouldn't have hung up
without a good reason.

74
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:40,901
And I had no time to prepare
because you called me out of nowhere.

75
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,028
<i>I told you to get ready</i>
<i>to move at any second.</i>

76
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:44,321
I was ready!

77
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,781
That's why I was able to--

78
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:56,375
What the...

79
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:58,627
What is it this time?

80
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,689
<i>- Myeong-jun, do you have a death wish?</i>
- We're in trouble.

81
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,775
Someone suddenly came out of the alley
and collapsed.

82
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,528
<i>What do you mean? Who collapsed?</i>

83
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:26,655
<i>Calm down and say it again.</i>
<i>What did you say?</i>

84
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,907
Hold on a second.

85
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,284
<i>Hey, Kim Myeong-jun.</i>

86
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,661
<i>Kim Myeong-jun!</i>

87
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,432
Hey, it's that kid.

88
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,058
<i>What?</i>

89
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:56,727
The girl we're going to kidnap.

CHAPTER 1. THE KIDNAPPING

91
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,863
{\an8}BASED ON THE NOVEL
<i>THE DAY OF KIDNAPPING</i> BY JEONG HAE-YEON

92
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:49,446
Damn it.

93
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,417
INCOMING CALL

94
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,134
- Hey.
<i>- How's the kid?</i>

95
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,345
- <i>Is she awake?</i>
- Not yet.

96
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,473
I think I should take her to the hospital.

97
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,432
<i>Are you insane?</i>

98
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,059
<i>The hospital? Are you in your right mind?</i>

99
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,186
I'm saying this because I am.

100
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,188
Should I stand around
when she might be hurt?

101
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:24,856
<i>You said you don't see any injuries.</i>

102
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,608
<i>This might be for the best.</i>

103
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,110
What do you mean?

104
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,362
<i>Do you think someone weak-minded like you</i>

105
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,239
<i>would've kidnapped her</i>
<i>if she didn't collapse?</i>

106
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:35,242
<i>This might be for the better.</i>

107
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:36,994
How can you say that?

108
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,287
She's hurt!

109
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:40,914
<i>Stop the nonsense and just do as I say.</i>

110
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,667
<i>Don't decide on anything yourself</i>
<i>and complicate things.</i>

111
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,085
From now on,

112
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,421
I'm going to make the decisions myself
and do things my way.

113
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,215
I know we're doing this for Hee-ae,
but this is wrong.

114
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:51,258
<i>Hey, Kim Myeong-jun!</i>

115
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:15,991
Gosh, you startled me.

116
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:28,503
Tell me.

117
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:30,839
- What?
- I said tell me.

118
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,341
About me?

119
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:41,224
What's the rope for?

120
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,186
Oh, this rope.

121
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,270
It's...

122
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,732
to change the clothesline that snapped.

123
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:53,528
By the way...

124
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:55,906
are you okay?

125
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:57,824
What do you mean?

126
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:01,370
Are you not injured or anything?

127
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:04,164
I don't think that's what's important.

128
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,709
What?

129
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,087
What is it?

130
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,047
Why aren't you answering? I said tell me.

131
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:13,799
Oh, about me?

132
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:14,883
Well...

133
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,929
- You see, I'm--
- Not you, me.

134
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,973
- What?
- I'm talking about myself.

135
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:23,308
Who am I?

136
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,814
<i>You don't remember anything?</i>

137
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,148
No.

138
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:31,775
You really don't?

139
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:32,984
No.

140
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:38,865
This is unpleasant.

141
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,452
How's your condition?

142
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:45,038
Why do you keep asking
pointless questions?

143
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:47,207
I said I don't remember.

144
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:51,336
Tell me.

145
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:53,463
- About you?
- You.

146
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:55,590
- Me?
- Yes, you.

147
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:56,800
Oh, me.

148
00:11:58,802 --> 00:11:59,803
By the way,

149
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,806
why are you talking casually to an adult?

150
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,266
That's not important right now.

151
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:06,685
You're right.

152
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,353
It's not.

153
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:10,021
Damn it.

154
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:11,064
MY DEAR DAD

155
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:12,023
Well...

156
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,360
- Dad?
- What? Dad?

157
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,321
Oh, yes! I'm your dad!

158
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,907
That's right. It's me, Dad.

159
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:22,242
What are you laughing about?

160
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:23,994
Your daughter lost her memory.

161
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:26,663
I know.

162
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,248
I'm sorry.

163
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:37,883
Who am I?

164
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:39,468
What's my name?

165
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,013
Hee-ae.

166
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:44,222
It's Kim Hee-ae.

167
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:46,433
Hee-ae.

168
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:48,643
Try calling me.

169
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:54,983
Hee-ae.

170
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:56,943
Doesn't have a ring to it.

171
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,071
So what happened?

172
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:02,866
Did I hit my head?

173
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,660
Or did I fall down from somewhere?
What's wrong with me?

174
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,162
Well...

175
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:09,080
I lost my memory.

176
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,583
There must be a reason.

177
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,711
It happens sometimes. It comes and goes.

178
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:20,217
You think I have dementia?

179
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,177
Why would my memories come and go?

180
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:26,515
Are you really my dad?

181
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,439
- Food.
- What?

182
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:36,149
Aren't you going to give me food?

183
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,241
I mean,

184
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:47,410
did she really lose her memory or what?

185
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,916
Jeez, whatever.

186
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,192
"Kim Hee-ae."

187
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:21,403
Hee-ae.

188
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,156
It doesn't sound familiar.

189
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:39,754
Hee-ae, come eat.

190
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:44,467
You call this food?

191
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:45,760
Yes, well...

192
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:48,513
I forgot to buy rice.

193
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,848
Let's eat this for today.

194
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,725
I'll make you proper food tomorrow.

195
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,143
All right.

196
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:56,730
This is interesting.

197
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,232
Is it? Here, eat it.

198
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,456
Is it good?

199
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:16,291
It's not bad.

200
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:17,834
I see.

201
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,545
That doesn't mean I'm satisfied.

202
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,881
I'm eating this because I'm hungry.

203
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:26,009
I want you to cook
a proper meal for me tomorrow.

204
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,345
Sure. Okay.

205
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,349
Also, do you smoke?

206
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,100
What?

207
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:36,603
Judging by how I feel unpleasant,
I probably hated the smell of it.

208
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,563
Smoke after I go to bed.

209
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,733
I don't want to smell
that unpleasant odor.

210
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,656
Okay. Sorry.

211
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:29,114
INCOMING CALL

212
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,577
<i>Your call cannot be completed.</i>

213
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,663
<i>You will be connected to voicemail.</i>

214
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,833
Why aren't they picking up
when their kid is gone?

215
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,292
Goodness.

216
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:50,802
Damn it!

217
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:44,230
- Who are you?
- What?

218
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,191
- You little...
- It's not what it looks like.

219
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:47,567
Where are you going?

220
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:49,611
Who are you?!

221
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,821
Junkman.

222
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,198
- What?
- I'm a junkman.

223
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:05,001
Why are you looking for junk
inside a house?

224
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:08,213
Everyone left this area
and the places are empty.

225
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,674
Who would've known
you were living in that house?

226
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:14,719
Goodness.

227
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:19,891
I messed up my life big time,

228
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,476
so I ended up living here.

229
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:26,439
What about you? Why do you live here?

230
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,525
Judging by your strength earlier,

231
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,777
I'm sure you can do better for yourself.

232
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:33,905
Tell me about it.

233
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,074
I don't know

234
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:37,742
how I ended up here either.

235
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:42,872
Goodbye then.

236
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,082
Right.

237
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,835
That car is mine
so don't take anything from it.

238
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:49,212
I'm too scared to take anything from you.

239
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:51,172
I have morals too, you know.

240
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,300
Bye.

241
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:32,255
Damn it.

242
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:38,761
Damn it.

243
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:43,057
Where's the photo album?

244
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,463
<i>Hee-ae!</i>

245
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,383
Are you going to stay there?

246
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,302
You should go inside. Aren't you tired?

247
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,348
Why would I be tired?
You're the one who's tired.

248
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:06,766
You're so sweet.

249
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:08,434
Right, Hee-ae.

250
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,229
My boss is giving me a raise next month.

251
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:13,564
I can send you to academies then.

252
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:16,401
I don't need to go to academies.

253
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,738
Come on, I want you to go.

254
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,157
I feel bad that you come here
with me every day.

255
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,201
Myeong-jun!

256
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,161
You should eat.

257
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,371
Yes, sir.

258
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:31,791
Let's eat.

259
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,796
Why are you picking at your food?

260
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:39,674
I ate like a horse when I was your age.

261
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,259
Here, eat more.

262
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,512
You should eat well to work.

263
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:48,474
I get my energy from watching you eat.

264
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:49,851
Didn't you see me earlier?

265
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,359
Myeong-jun, you should eat well too.

266
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:00,445
Thank you, sir.

267
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:05,408
What's wrong?

268
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:09,245
I feel dizzy.

269
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:10,663
What?

270
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,003
Here. Lie down for a bit.

271
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:24,260
Maybe she's sick.

272
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,220
She seemed pale since a few days ago.

273
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:34,145
<i>Leukemia?</i>

274
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:36,606
It must've been tough for your daughter.

275
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:40,151
At this stage, I'm sure
she had severe headaches as well.

276
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,653
But still, we found it at an early stage
so it's a relief.

277
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:44,572
She should be hospitalized

278
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:47,742
and receive chemotherapy
to see if there's any improvement.

279
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:49,535
But...

280
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:53,664
Why?

281
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:58,544
Did I pass down the illness to her?

282
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:01,839
You must stay strong.

283
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,134
Hold on...

284
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:09,055
What do I have to do to save her?

285
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:18,815
Go inside.

286
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:38,376
It's okay. Go ahead.

287
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:48,511
<i>She needs to get a bone marrow transplant.</i>

288
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,973
<i>We'll have to wait for a donor</i>

289
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,182
<i>with the same stem cell type.</i>

290
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:16,330
My Hee-ae...

291
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:17,915
I'm sorry.

292
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,603
<i>Today's daytime high in Seoul</i>

293
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:40,730

294
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:43,191
<i>and it's expected</i>

295
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:45,860
<i>The weather is expected to be humid</i>
<i>and scorching hot,</i>

296
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:49,572
<i>being able to feel the hot sunlight.</i>

297
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:52,950
<i>Because there aren't many clouds,</i>
<i>the weather will be hotter in the...</i>

298
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,952
You're awake.

299
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:57,496
You're hungry, right? The food is ready.

300
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:06,297
Eat up.

301
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:16,390
What's this?

302
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:20,228
Care to explain?

303
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:21,604
Don't you know white <i>buchimgae</i>?

304
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:22,647
No.

305
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:25,149
And I don't want to know what it is.

306
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:28,110
I know it looks bland, but it tastes--

307
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:29,445
Forget it.

308
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:33,741
It's good.

309
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,663
February 27th, 2019.

310
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:41,832
The expiration date
was over four years ago!

311
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:43,542
Do you remember today's date?

312
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:44,835
You think I'm illiterate?

313
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:46,671
I can read a calendar.

314
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:48,339
I see.

315
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:49,799
Flour doesn't expire.

316
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:52,051
Yes, it does.

317
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:55,513
You think the manufacturer
wrote the expiration date for no reason?

318
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,432
Did I live here eating this until now?

319
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:00,685
Of course!

320
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:02,770
Look at us. We're both healthy!

321
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:09,860
I guess I grew up decent
considering the food I had.

322
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:12,113
Hey, come sit.

323
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:13,281
This is good.

324
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:15,449
- I added sugar, so it's--
- Make me something else.

325
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,619
- Come on, try it--
- No!

326
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:21,789
Hey, that's not made of bamboo! It hurts!

327
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,124
That's why I hit you.

328
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,171
Are you sure this is my house?

329
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:31,007
Take a look. It's your room.

330
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:35,428
It's unpleasant and appalling.

331
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:42,143
Damn it, that little brat...

332
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:44,061
What are you doing?

333
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:47,148
I...

334
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:50,985
I was going to take a shower
after I finished eating.

335
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,154
Where did all the photos go?

336
00:26:53,738 --> 00:26:55,406
Oh, the photos?

337
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:57,366
Well...

338
00:26:57,575 --> 00:27:00,578
It kept getting in the way of cleaning,
so I put them away.

339
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,414
At least you clean the house.

340
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:04,582
Of course I do!

341
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:11,088
If you're going to clean the house,
do it properly!

342
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:13,132
I can't even tell if you did it or not.

343
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:14,759
How filthy.

344
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:19,013
Are those the only books in the house?

345
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,014
Yes!

346
00:27:20,181 --> 00:27:21,474
No other books or newspapers?

347
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:22,725
No!

348
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:25,519
Darn it.

349
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:28,981
Don't eat it then.

350
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:30,941
I'm going to eat it all.

351
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:43,204
Here. I'm going out to get groceries,
so watch it while I'm gone.

352
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,840
<i>Alice was in the garden with her sister.</i>

353
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,551
I watched this kind of stuff?

354
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:59,720
<i>She saw a white rabbit...</i>

00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:17,196
Yes.

357
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,281
Please put it in a bag.

358
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:30,376

<i>I don't want to smell</i>

00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:54,316

00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:10,833
Here and there.

365
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:15,421
Do you stay here all the time?

366
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:18,299
What about work?

367
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:20,593
When I have work, I go out.
If not, I stay here.

368
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:26,640
What brings you here?

369
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:28,851
It's been three years since we met.

370
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,604
Is that the only question you have?

371
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:34,982
You suddenly appeared after three years

372
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:37,359
and didn't even look at your sick daughter
for five minutes.

373
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:39,778
What about the hospital bill?

374
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:42,323
I can manage.

375
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:43,991
I know you can't.

376
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,327
Then what about you?

377
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,872
You took all the money three years ago,

378
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,708
and you dare to talk about money?

379
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:55,920
What about the hospital bill?

380
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,631
I took out the deposit on the house,
sold everything I could,

381
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,467
and I even took out a private loan.

382
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:04,053
Even if I have to sell my organs,

383
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:07,181
I'm going to make sure
Hee-ae gets that surgery.

384
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:08,933
So I'm selling everything I have.
Satisfied?

385
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:10,184
That's why I came.

386
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:16,106
Take a good look.

387
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:20,736
She'll take care
of our daughter's hospital bill.

388
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:33,290
<i>Don't write down my number.</i>
<i>Memorize it, okay?</i>

389
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,837
010-0648-7730.

390
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:51,767
Why isn't she picking up?
Did something happen to her or something?

391
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:00,609
Jeez.

392
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,573
- What do you want?
<i>- What about the kid?</i>

393
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:07,241
She's home.

394
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:08,993
<i>Did you talk to her parents?</i>

395
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:10,536
They won't pick up.

396
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,454
<i>Did you dial the right number?</i>

397
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:15,207
I've been constantly calling them,
but they aren't picking up.

398
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,750
<i>That doesn't make sense.</i>

399
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:19,169
<i>Their kid got kidnapped,</i>
<i>but they aren't picking up for days?</i>

400
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:22,548
It doesn't make sense to me either.

401
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:28,095
Gosh, why do I keep trying to smoke?

402
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:29,346
<i>Hey, Kim Myeong-jun.</i>

403
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,390
<i>Are you smoking in front of a kid?</i>

404
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,808
I'm outside.

405
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,393
<i>She's home alone?</i>

406
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:35,519
Then should I bring her with me?

407
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:36,854
<i>Will it kill you not to smoke?</i>

408
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:38,397
<i>Why would you leave her alone?</i>

409
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:41,191
I came out to get some groceries.
You want me to starve her?

410
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:42,443
I know we kidnapped...

411
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,741
I need to take care of her
while she's with me.

412
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:55,122
By the way, where are you?

413
00:31:55,456 --> 00:31:56,457
<i>Why do you ask?</i>

414
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,501
I told you to stay with Hee-ae.
Where are you?

415
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:01,378
You're outside, right? What about Hee-ae?

416
00:32:01,462 --> 00:32:03,881
<i>She's probably sleeping anyway.</i>

417
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:05,716
You...

418
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,552
You call yourself a mom? Hey!

419
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:10,763
Hello?

420
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:13,515
Damn it.

00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:17,519

My poor baby.

430
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,648
She didn't even empty her urine bag.

431
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,777
Seo Hye-eun, I won't let this slide.

432

Hee-ae, you need to go, right?
I'll empty the bag for you.

433
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:43,582
Hello.

434
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:46,710
You must be here to get her stuff.

435
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:51,715
Oh, yes. I'm here to get her stuff.

436
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:54,384
It must've been tough for you.

437
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:58,806
Tell Jin-hui that I'll miss her.

00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:01,058
Sure. Thank you.

There's someone in Room 807?

440
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:16,782
Who?

441
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:19,201
He said he was Jin-hui's father.

442
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,873
Jin-hui's dad is in the lobby with her.

443
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:26,917
I told you
not to let random people inside.

What's this?

445
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:32,673
Goodness, who did this?

446
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:35,884
My gosh!

447
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:37,928
Hee-ae's father?

448
00:35:40,556 --> 00:35:44,518
I'm sorry!

449
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:45,644
Mr. Kim!

450
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:47,729
I'll visit next time!

451
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,815

Mr. Kim!

Mr. Kim!

We found a donor!

455
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:04,538
We found a donor
that matches Hee-ae's cells.

456
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:06,832
She can get the surgery.

457

<i>She'll be able to get surgery.</i>

458
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,430
<i>But you have to pay</i>
<i>the overdue hospital bill</i>

00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:30,147

DO NOT ENTER, DEMOLITION IN PROCESS

I live in a redevelopment area?

464
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:01,386
That's why I don't see anyone.

465
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:47,557
When is he coming back?
I'm starving to death here.

466
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,235
Thank you.

467
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,538
Hee-ae!

Hee-ae!

469
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:13,917
Hee-ae!

470
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:35,480
You waited long, right?

471
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,482
Did you go to a farm
and dig out the ingredients?

472
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:40,277
I'm sorry.

473
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:54,374
Ta-da.

474
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:11,266
Make it again.

475
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:16,980
That's what I want to say,

476
00:39:17,064 --> 00:39:20,275
but I'm starving, so I'll just eat it.

477
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:22,277
Yes, you should eat up.

478
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:40,837
Why are you smiling?

479
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:42,464
What?

480
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:46,051
Oh, you just eat so well.

481
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:47,886
Whatever.

482
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:53,725
By the way, Dad,

483
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:35,642
What?

484
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:44,734
Forget it.

485
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:47,320
I can't even talk to you.

486
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:52,367
Anyway, what about Mom?

487
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:54,870
What?

488
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:56,538
Mom?

489
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:58,081
What about her?

490
00:40:58,582 --> 00:41:00,709
It's weird that Mom's not home.

491
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:05,172
Yes, your mom.

492
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,506
Is she dead?

493
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:10,760
No, she's not.

494
00:41:11,178 --> 00:41:12,345
Then are you guys divorced?

495
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:16,183
Well, it's something like that.

496
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:17,267
Did she have an affair?

497
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:19,561
No, well...

498
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:23,064
Anyway, it's just something.

499
00:41:26,026 --> 00:41:28,528
Also, do I have a younger sibling?

500
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:29,988
Sibling?

501
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:31,823
What about a sibling?

502
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:36,036
The face in the photos
doesn't look like me.

503
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:38,872
Well...

504
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:42,000
your looks changed while growing up.

505
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:43,460
Really?

506
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,798
I can't say anything
because I lost my memory.

507
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:20,163
<i>The device you've dialed is turned off.</i>
<i>You will be connected to voicemail.</i>

508
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:22,666
<i>You will be charged after the beep.</i>

509
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:41,726
What?

510
00:42:43,937 --> 00:42:45,480
Are they sleeping?

511
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,066
How can they when their kid is gone?

512
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:50,277
Jeez.

513
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:52,529
Damn it.

514
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:23,268
WHEN YOU GET CAUGHT AFTER KIDNAPPING

515
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:24,269
WHAT DOES KIDNAPPING MEAN?

516
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:26,438
IT'S A KIDNAPPER!

517
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:28,857
WHAT DO YOU DO
WHEN YOU GET CAUGHT KIDNAPPING?

518
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,651
KIDNAPPING IS A SERIOUS CRIME. REPORT IT.
SHOULDN'T YOU THROW AWAY YOUR PHONE FIRST?

519
00:43:31,735 --> 00:43:32,777
Damn it.

520
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:44,289
"Filial love."

521
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:50,295
"I love you, Dad. From Hee-ae."

522
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:54,507
Did I gift this to you?

523
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:58,136
Yes, two years ago on my birthday.

524
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:01,306
What do you use this for?

525
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:02,432
You don't know
what a "filial child's hand" is?

526
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:03,725
"Filial child's hand"?

527
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:05,143
Give it to me.

528
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:08,021
It's called that because it's refreshing

529
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:10,982
like when a good kid
scratches their parents' backs.

530
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:12,942
- Feels nice, right?
- Yes.

531
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,279
It's quite refreshing.

532
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:18,031
Give it to me!

533
00:44:18,448 --> 00:44:20,033
Don't get your filth on this scratcher.

534
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:24,037
I took a shower too! I'm clean!

535
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:30,126
Jeez.

536
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:38,885
What are you doing?

537
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:42,097
Why? Are you going to get changed?

538
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:43,264
Yes.

539
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:45,683
I can't wear this all the time.

540
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:48,812
It kind of smells too.

541
00:44:49,646 --> 00:44:52,982
But look how horrendous these clothes are.

542
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,526
None of them fits my taste.

543
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:57,112
They're weird. They don't seem like mine.

544
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:59,030
Why not? You look great in them.

545
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:01,741
The one that I'm wearing is okay,

546
00:45:01,825 --> 00:45:03,076
but the ones in the closet aren't.

547
00:45:03,827 --> 00:45:05,036
Are these really mine?

548
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:09,582
Of course. You loved them.

549
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:11,543
Here.

550
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:13,753
Try this one.

551
00:45:17,257 --> 00:45:18,258
Go ahead.

552
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:26,850
All right.

553
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,604
Gosh, you look so pretty.

554
00:45:32,522 --> 00:45:33,565
All right.

555
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:35,692
Ta-da.

556
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:39,612
What the...

557
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:46,161
I kind of look like a peach.

558
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:55,378
By the way, did you abuse me?

559
00:45:55,712 --> 00:45:56,713
What?

560
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:00,925
What? What's this?

561
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,639
Right.

562
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,016
Remember?

563
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:10,977
You were stung by a bee.

564
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,730
I was stung by a bee?
It's not even swollen.

565
00:46:14,189 --> 00:46:15,815
The swelling is gone.

566
00:46:15,899 --> 00:46:18,276
The bruise is going away too.

567
00:46:23,907 --> 00:46:26,659
I guess you're right.
You don't have it in you to hit kids.

568
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:29,954
Jeez. You call me dad,
but you talk so disrespectfully.

569
00:46:30,497 --> 00:46:31,873
What's with that?

570
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:35,084
My memory isn't back yet,
so I'm speaking to you however I like.

571
00:46:35,502 --> 00:46:37,670
I'll make up my mind
about how to speak to you

572
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,423
once my memory comes back.

573
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:43,218
Jeez, what's so hard about calling me dad?

574
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:50,266
Are you out of your mind?
What do you want me to say?

575
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:52,810
Just say, "I miss you, Dad."

576
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:54,729
Why would I say that?

577
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:56,940
It gives me energy when I work.

578
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,358
Do you actually work?

579
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:00,443
I've never seen you go out for work.

580
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:02,487
I work at night.

581
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:05,114
Let's try it, okay?
I'm going to record it.

582
00:47:05,907 --> 00:47:06,866
Here.

583
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:11,913
Go on.

584
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:14,332
Dad.

585
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:17,085
Say, "I miss you."

586
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:21,923
This isn't right.

587
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,926
Why would I say that I miss you
when you're right in front of me?

588
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:27,303
I told you I'll listen to it during work.

589
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:29,681
Then you should buy me a phone.

590
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:31,683
Jeez.

591
00:47:37,814 --> 00:47:39,774
You can't afford to buy me one, can you?

592
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,069
I'll buy you one some other time.

593
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:45,238
Then let's try, "Dad."

594
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:46,614
Here we go.

595
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:53,580
Dad.

596
00:47:53,663 --> 00:47:55,373
Don't sound so calm.
Be a bit more excited.

597
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:57,125
Bring more life into your tone.

598
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:01,421
Dad.

599
00:48:01,588 --> 00:48:02,672
A little bit louder.

600
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:05,800
Dad.

601
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:07,677
All right, one last time.

602
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:09,345
Dad!

603
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:11,681
It worked!

604
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:13,558
That was hard, wasn't it?

605
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:15,143
How dare you hit me?

606
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,645
I may look like this,
but I used to play sports.

607
00:48:17,729 --> 00:48:19,647
Athletes feel pain when they get hurt too!

608
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:21,608
Goodness, it's over here.

609
00:48:26,863 --> 00:48:28,156
Open the door!

610
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:29,907
You're dead meat!

611
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:33,202
<i>Dad.</i>

612
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,123
<i>Dad.</i>

613
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:40,043
<i>Dad.</i>

614
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:48,468
Dad!

615
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:06,778
Open the door!

616
00:49:21,334 --> 00:49:22,460
What?

617
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:24,587
Are you crying?

618
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,383
Did it hurt that much?

619
00:49:31,094 --> 00:49:32,178
I'm not crying.

620
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:37,767
Did I hit you with the ends?

621
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:40,561
You just say sorry at times like this.

622
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:48,861
Be careful.

623
00:49:49,404 --> 00:49:51,906
This scratcher may not be all that filial.

624
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:17,557
She sleeps just like Hee-ae.

625
00:50:40,288 --> 00:50:42,498
Hee-ae, put the blanket over you.

626
00:51:20,036 --> 00:51:22,914
LIST
RECORDING 003

627
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:25,416
<i>Dad, I miss you!</i>

628
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:26,709
<i>Good luck!</i>

629
00:51:26,793 --> 00:51:28,878
<i>And I'm sorry for hitting you earlier.</i>

630
00:51:40,056 --> 00:51:41,307
<i>Dad.</i>

631
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,060
<i>Say, "I miss you."</i>

632
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:45,269
<i>Dad!</i>

633
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:48,981
<i>It worked!</i>

634
00:51:49,065 --> 00:51:50,483
<i>All right, one last time.</i>

635
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:51,692
<i>Dad!</i>

636
00:51:58,157 --> 00:52:00,409
All right. Let's take you home soon.

637
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,835
<i>The device you've dialed is turned off.</i>
<i>You will be connected to voicemail.</i>

638
00:52:09,252 --> 00:52:10,753
<i>You will be charged after...</i>

639
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:14,632
What on earth are they doing?

640
00:52:17,093 --> 00:52:18,094
Jeez.

641
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:22,515
{\an8}HELLO

642
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:28,521
{\an8}YOUR DAUGHTER IS WITH ME,
SAFE AND SOUND...

643
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:32,567
What? What's this?

644
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:35,278
What...

645
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:45,413
{\an8}I CAN'T GET IN TOUCH WITH THEM,

646
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:51,210
{\an8}SO I'M GOING TO CHECK WHAT THEY'RE DOING

647
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:02,717
What the...

648
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:35,166
We are here at the scene...

649
00:55:39,837 --> 00:55:41,839
- Gosh.
- What's going on?

650
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:43,632
- Goodness.
- My goodness.

651
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:46,594
Someone must've gotten hurt badly.

652
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:48,345
- Should we wait?
- Yes.

653
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:50,347
I guess we can't go home tonight.

654
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:55,686
What is it? Did someone die?

655
00:56:33,474 --> 00:56:34,975
Wait!

656
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:58,082
No, wait. Please move!

657
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:00,251
- Oh, no.
- Let us film please.

658
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:03,212
<i>We are here at the murder scene</i>
<i>in a wealthy neighborhood in Youngin.</i>

659
00:57:03,546 --> 00:57:05,965
<i>The two bodies covered in white cloth</i>

660
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:08,676
<i>show the cruelty of the case.</i>

661
00:57:09,135 --> 00:57:11,595
<i>The victims are Choi,</i>
<i>a doctor who runs a hospital in Youngin,</i>

662
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,556
<i>and his wife.</i>

663
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:17,351
<i>The bodies were found by the housekeeper</i>
<i>who returned from vacation.</i>

664
00:57:17,518 --> 00:57:19,353
<i>Judging from their</i>
<i>highly decomposed bodies,</i>

665
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:22,648
<i>they seem to have been found</i>
<i>days after the murder occurred.</i>

666
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:15,492
{\an8}<i>It's strange.</i>

667
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:17,661
{\an8}<i>Why did the murderer take the kid?</i>

668
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:20,915
{\an8}<i>When you kidnap a kid,</i>
<i>you usually negotiate with their parents.</i>

669
00:58:21,123 --> 00:58:22,249
{\an8}<i>But why kill them instead?</i>

670
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,793
{\an8}<i>We need to find out what he's after.</i>

671
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:26,295
{\an8}<i>What about the CCTV footage?</i>

672
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:28,380
{\an8}You went to retrieve
the CCTVs that day, right?

673
00:58:28,464 --> 00:58:30,758
{\an8}Did you find anything unusual
in terms of his actions?

674
00:58:31,217 --> 00:58:32,927
{\an8}- My daughter.
- <i>Patient Kim Hee-ae's</i>

675
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,970
{\an8}<i>hospital bill has been paid for.</i>

676
00:58:35,054 --> 00:58:37,806
{\an8}<i>I'm going to send Ro-hee home</i>
<i>and turn myself in.</i>

677
00:58:37,932 --> 00:58:40,184
{\an8}I have to send her back
before things blow up.

678
00:58:40,267 --> 00:58:41,977
{\an8}- Over here, hurry!
- <i>Ro-hee!</i>

679
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:44,063
{\an8}Excuse me! Please check on my daughter.

680
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:45,189
{\an8}<i>Register?</i>

681
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:46,690
{\an8}Damn it.

682
00:58:46,774 --> 00:58:48,943
{\an8}I think it's child abuse.

683
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:50,402
{\an8}<i>Call the police.</i>

684
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:51,779
{\an8}<i>Choi Ro-hee?</i>

685
00:58:52,488 --> 00:58:54,323
{\an8}<i>His name is Kim Myeong-jun, 39 years old.</i>

686
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:56,325
{\an8}<i>He was crying with her on his back</i>
<i>when he came in.</i>

687
00:58:56,784 --> 00:58:58,244
{\an8}<i>I don't get what the culprit is thinking.</i>

688
00:58:59,245 --> 00:59:01,121
{\an8}- What?
<i>- We don't want to provoke him</i>

689
00:59:01,205 --> 00:59:02,748
{\an8}<i>and put the kid in danger.</i>

690
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:04,833
{\an8}Don't go anywhere without me.

691
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:07,211
{\an8}<i>Ro-hee's not here!</i>

692
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:08,337
{\an8}Ro-hee!

693
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:10,631
{\an8}Ro-hee!
