00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,663
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS, GROUPS,

2
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:04,448
AND SETTINGS ARE FICTITIOUS,
AND CHILD SAFETY GUIDELINES WERE FOLLOWED

3
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,360
Breaking news.

4
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:11,947
The suspect in the kidnapping case
that occurred in Youngin in May,

5
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:16,285
Kim Myeong-jun, was arrested
by the police earlier today.

6
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:18,662
<i>After the murder case was concluded,</i>

7
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:21,290
<i>he took advantage
of the lack of interest in the case</i>

8
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:24,168
<i>and moved into Choi Ro-hee's house,</i>

9
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,836
<i>showing his discreet nature.</i>

10
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,464
<i>Above all else,
the public is interested in</i>

11
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:31,342
<i>whether Choi Ro-hee is alive or not.</i>

12
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:34,887
<i>Choi Ro-hee, who was known to be murdered,</i>

13
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,181
<i>has been confirmed to be alive.</i>

14
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:40,309
<i>However, to make sure that she is…</i>

15
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,311
That fund manager, Jaden.

16
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:43,729
Bring him here right now!

17
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:44,939
Yes, sir.

18
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:49,068
I even used my connections for him,

19
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:52,530
and all he did was take my money
and make this mess?

20
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:00,496
Sir, you have a call from Choi Ro-hee.

21
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,959
KIDNAPPER KIM MYEONG-JUN ARRESTED

22
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,126
Hee-ae.

23
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:10,506
Hee-ae.

24
00:02:11,257 --> 00:02:12,633
You can stay alone, right?

25
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,927
Mom, are you going somewhere?

26
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,181
To earn money.

27
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,643
I thought you were going to stay with me

28
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:25,229
while Dad has gone to make money.

29
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,192
I'll…

30
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,654
make more money.

31
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:37,950
Can't you just stay with me?

32
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:44,123
What am I to do
if both of my parents are gone?

33
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,419
I'm a good girl.

34
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,923
I stayed quietly at Dad's workplace too.

35
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,635
I'm not a picky eater either.

36
00:02:57,595 --> 00:02:59,430
I won't give you a hard time.

37
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:02,057
<i>Please don't send me back.</i>

38
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:05,227
You don't have to adopt me.
I'll be your servant if I have to.

39
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:06,687
I'm good at running errands,

40
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,856
carrying heavy things, and doing laundry.

41
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,191
I learned how to cook
at the orphanage too!

42
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,243
Hee-ae.

43
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,878
Don't trust anyone.

44
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:34,006
That way…

45
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:36,884
you won't get hurt.

46
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:39,470
So Hee-ae,

47
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:41,430
Don't trust

48
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,557
a single soul,

49
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:47,186
including me, okay?

50
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:49,730
- Mom…
- Answer me!

51
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,149
Do you understand?

52
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,027
Yes.

53
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,259
What an interesting situation, Sang-yun.

54
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,222
You haven't changed at all,
causing trouble like a lone wolf.

55
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,432
And this time,
you were carrying out a mission

56
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:27,351
while you were still suspended.

57
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,436
How heroic.

58
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:33,691
Against your superior's orders, right?

59
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,236
I always wondered
why you behave the way you do.

60
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:38,404
And it turns out

61
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,740
you have powerful connections.

62
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,242
Gosh.

63
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:45,577
Impressive, Sang-yun.

64
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,247
Connections? What do you mean?

65
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:53,293
Are you playing dumb or what?

66
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,808
You can learn
who your connection is out there.

67
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,643
You lucky bastard.

68
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:26,452
What happened?

69
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:31,165
I got a call from Ro-hee
as soon as Mr. Kim was arrested yesterday.

70
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,079
She said we don't have time,
so we need to move fast.

71
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,671
Are you the one who got me released?

72
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:42,593
Ro-hee did.

73
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,725
- What are they doing?
- What's taking so long?

74
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,494
- How long do we have to wait?
- It's about time.

75
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,145
Hello, I'm her attorney.

76
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,271
Okay.

77
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,655
You got out fast.

78
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:06,909
My blood pressure is okay.

79
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:10,037
Now that you've checked
my temperature and Apical Pulse,

80
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:11,705
can you leave?

81
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,929
We'll get going then.

82
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,430
Thank you.

83
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,188
How did you do it?

84
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:39,691
It's the power of the man
who's my so-called great-uncle.

85
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,611
He's been wielding his power for the bad,

86
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:45,734
so it's only right
he uses it for good at least once.

87
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,701
You saw the reporters outside, right?

88
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:51,120
Yes.

89
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:52,496
This is the beginning.

90
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:56,041
Articles about Mr. Kim
will pour out endlessly,

91
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:00,796
and they'll use provocative words
for the headlines.

92
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:04,758
That means Mr. Kim has no advantage
during the trial whatsoever.

93
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:07,219
That's why

94
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:10,180
we should give them something to chew on
at the right time.

95
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,392
We'll use even more provocative words

96
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:17,020
to divert the public's attention.

97
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,984
People don't care about the truth anyway.

98
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,736
They just want gossip.

99
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,614
Do you have anything in mind?

100
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,324
Investigation.

101
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:32,578
You'll have to start it again.

102
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:36,165
As you saw, the kidnapping case

103
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,250
is no longer within our jurisdiction.

104
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,085
Not that.

105
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:41,628
I'm talking about the murder case.

106
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,173
Let's end it.

107
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:49,970
FINAL CHAPTER. THE KIDNAPPING DAY

108
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,347
- They're coming out.
- Ms. Choi Ro-hee, are you okay?

109
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:54,071
Is it true that the kidnapper abused you?

110
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,727
The kidnapper has a record of murder.
Has he ever threatened you?

111
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,937
- Answer us!
- Right, my laptop.

112
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,190
- Laptop?
- Is it inside?

113
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:02,357
Yes, in the study.

114
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:04,538
I don't want to leave it
in an empty house.

115
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,028
I think I should have it with me.

116
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,070
I'll go get it.

117
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,573
Please.

118
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,231
Did you see the female officer
who just left?

119
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:44,566
Sorry? What's wrong?

120
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:45,936
No one may enter this place.

121
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,212
An important
piece of evidence disappeared.

122
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:48,236
Yes, sir.

123
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,377
What's wrong?

124
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,544
The laptop disappeared.

125
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:05,879
I think someone took it.

126
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,925
Isn't it obvious who took it?

127
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,708
No one would've gotten hurt

128
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,671
if you were cooperative like this
to begin with.

129
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:45,876
Just confirm it.

130
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:18,035
You did your money's worth.

131
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:20,787
Confirmed, ma'am.

132
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:22,914
We seal the deal here then.

133
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:26,335
I hope you don't make a fuss
and come find me again.

134
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,128
I'm not a loser.

135
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:35,260
I prefer Latin America.

136
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,890
You can do anything if you have money.

137
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,019
Well, Korea is also great
if you have money.

138
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,393
- Come in.
- Hello.

139
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,201
Did you check?

140
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,203
<i>You're right.</i>

141
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,581
<i>The people going in
and coming out are different.</i>

142
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,959
Let me talk to the video analyst.

143
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,460
Yes, sir.

144
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:54,548
Yes, this is he.

145
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:58,593
The legs of the person leaving
are crooked inwards.

146
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,971
<i>This means they are knocked-knees.</i>

147
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,348
<i>But the person going in
doesn't have knocked-knees.</i>

148
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:07,144
<i>If you look at the way that person walks,</i>

149
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,062
<i>the person who's leaving</i>

150
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:11,565
walks in the way most females do.

151
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,358
Female?

152
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:15,735
Okay. Thank you.

153
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:17,988
All right.

154
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,199
Let's add Seo Hye-eun
to our list of suspects

155
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,076
and locate her.

156
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,370
When we get a warrant, call the airport

157
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:26,779
and issue a travel ban on her.

158
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,416
And get a list
of all the hotel guests in Seoul.

159
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:30,584
- Get moving!
- Yes, sir.

160
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:31,668
Wait.

161
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:34,087
This may not be enough.

162
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:37,799
We can only speculate that it's a woman.

163
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:39,885
Pressuring her like this is important,

164
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,637
but we should also make her come to us.

165
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,725
Does your chief…

166
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,686
like being on TV?

167
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,611
Yes, he loves it.

168
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:03,896
What are you doing at this hour?

169
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:09,289
Hey, shouldn't she be at the hospital?

170
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:11,541
And Park Sang-yun.

171
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,919
Aren't you still suspended?

172
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,712
I asked him to come with me.

173
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:17,964
He's the most trustworthy police officer.

174
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:20,091
What?

175
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:23,094
He knows how to fight
against his corrupt superiors.

176
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:26,181
Isn't that
what a trustworthy police officer is?

177
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,395
I set up this meeting
because she had something to tell us.

178
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,564
Please sit, sir.

179
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:39,443
All right.

180
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,655
I heard the gist of the story.

181
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,074
You were close with the kidnapper.

182
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:48,036
I hope you're not asking me
to release him.

183
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,748
I know what to ask and what not to ask.

184
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,086
All right.

185
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:00,090
Since you know what to ask, ask away.

186
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:03,134
It's about the murder.

187
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,720
The murder? Park Cheol-won?

188
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:08,783
There was another person
at the scene, including Park Cheol-won.

189
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:11,142
In the dashcam nearby,

190
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,062
someone left Dr. Choi's house on the 21st.

191
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,523
According to forensics,

192
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,149
it's a woman.

193
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:19,693
- A woman?
- Yes, sir.

194
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,407
You all probably know
I was put to sleep on the 20th.

195
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:30,704
I woke up the next day,
left the house, and met the kidnapper.

196
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,332
But my dad never puts me to sleep
for two days straight.

197
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,376
That has never happened before.

198
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:39,713
That means someone put me to sleep

199
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:43,717
between the 20th and 21st
after my dad died.

200
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,761
And I remembered that person's face.

201
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:47,846
Who is it?

202
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,058
Go arrest her.

203
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,854
But we can't jump the gun here.

204
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:59,441
We're only assuming that it's a woman
according to forensics,

205
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:00,775
so there's no certainty.

206
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:03,486
Also, Ro-hee's memories aren't clear
due to the anesthesia,

207
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:05,756
and the culprit could use that
to their advantage.

208
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,780
So?

209
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:13,705
What do you want to do?

210
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:16,833
Find my laptop and pendant first.

211
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,836
They're solid evidence for this case.

212
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,027
Jaden!

213
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,947
Don't think of driving off, and freeze.

214
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,575
That goes for you two in black suits too.

215
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:55,372
Don't think of wasting our time
and just come with us.

216
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,584
I guess I have to book my ticket again.

217
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,842
Why are you here to see me
on such a nice day?

218
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,387
I guess you're all single.

219
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,598
Yes, I'm not interested in dating.

220
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,810
You must have connections.
I thought you'd be behind bars.

221
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,104
Well, I'm quite lucky.

222
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:21,940
You know Mr. Choi, right?

223
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:23,316
Ro-hee's great-uncle.

224
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,276
Never heard of him.

225
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,946
After the news reported
that Ro-hee was dead,

226
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:29,864
you two met quite often.

227
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,574
That's news to me.

228
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,870
Anyway, why are you here to arrest me?

229
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,916
Is it because you want to tell the world
that Ro-hee is a genius

230
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,918
who was artificially made?

231
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:44,587
No. You were reported for theft.

232
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,632
A child who lost her pendant reported you.

233
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,057
I applaud your efforts.

234
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,603
But please get a warrant first
before arresting me.

235
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,606
According to Criminal Law, Article 329,

236
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,318
you're arrested
without a warrant for theft.

237
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,082
- Please come with us.
- Please come with us.

238
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:11,448
Stay still.

239
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,325
Why can't you guys ever just listen?

240
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,554
You have the right to remain silent.

241
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:19,789
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

242
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:20,874
Remember that.

243
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,129
What an interesting situation.

244
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,177
Why did you commit the crime?

245
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,094
I'm sorry.

246
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,346
Were you involved in murdering
Dr. Choi and his wife?

247
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:37,807
No. I'm sorry.

248
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,267
Do you have an accomplice?

249
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,685
This is all my doing.

250
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:42,686
I'm sorry.

251
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,331
- Did you do it yourself?
- Was it intentional?

252
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:45,482
Please answer us!

253
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,108
Why did you kidnap Choi Ro-hee?

254
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:48,777
- Answer us!
- Please!

255
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,862
- Please!
- Please say something!

256
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,845
<i>Kim Myeong-jun,
who committed the kidnapping,</i>

257
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:00,955

258
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,749
<i>of Dr. Choi and his wife.</i>

259
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:07,378
<i>He said that he kidnapped the victim
as he was suffering financially.</i>

260
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:09,881
<i>The police plan to further investigate</i>

261
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:12,300
<i>how Kim Myeong-jun,
who also denied having an accomplice,</i>

262
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:16,846
<i>was able to evade the police
with the child for more than 20 days.</i>

263
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,616
<i>We, the police force, have arrested</i>

265
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:23,061
<i>However,</i>

266
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:26,940
<i>we have discovered that there was
another suspect at the scene.</i>

267
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,068
<i>According to the dashcam footage,</i>

268
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,654
<i>we are suspecting

269
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:37,033
<i>Choi Ro-hee, the kidnap victim
and the witness of this murder,</i>

270
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,829

271
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:46,751
<i>Your call cannot be completed.
You will be…</i>

272
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:01,099
SANGNAMJA PRIVATE AGENCY

273
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,184
Mr. Kim!

274
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:06,604
Mr. Kim!

275
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:44,017

CHOI RO-HEE'S MEMORIES RETURN…
THE SHOCKING TRUTH

279
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:00,617
WHO IS THE NEW SUSPECT?

280
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,078
WILL CHOI RO-HEE'S MEMORY
BECOME THE SMOKING GUN?

281
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:06,831
CHOI RO-HEE IS STAYING
AT HER GRANDPARENT'S HOUSE

282
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,004
<i>She is currently resting</i>

283
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:16,299
<i>at her late grandparent's house.</i>

284
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:19,302
<i>Did you find the new suspect
based on the child's memory?</i>

285
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:20,595
<i>Yes.</i>

286
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:24,015
<i>She explained the events with composure.</i>

287
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:26,851
<i>Mr. Park Cheol-won,
the prime suspect of the…</i>

288
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:27,977
Inmate 9133.

289
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:29,895
You have a visitor.

290
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:36,486
Mr. Kim Myeong-jun.

291
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:41,311
These are photos from the dashcam footage
that was taken on the day of the murder.

292
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:44,077
The two people who are wearing
security company uniforms

293
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:45,995
are different people.

294
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,166
This is Mr. Park Cheol-won.

295
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:52,251
And this is…

296
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,088
suspected to be Ms. Seo Hye-eun.

297
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,220
We will arrest Ms. Seo.

298
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:06,140
That's what Ro-hee wants,

299
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:08,559
and it's also best for her safety.

300
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,480
Okay.

301
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:14,607
However,

302
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,528
Ro-hee wishes to be with you.

303
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:20,780
She said she's scared.

304
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:26,202
But she thinks
she can muster up the courage…

305
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,123
if she's with you.

306
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,766
You're early.

307
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,812
I've never seen you before.

308
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,568
Are you the new attorney from X Capital?

309
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,741
Nice to meet you.

310
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:06,659
I'm Richard Choi.

311
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,327
I see.

312
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:09,579
Right.

313
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,039
Here.

314
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,586
Are you from HQ in Singapore?

315
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:17,920
Or the Korean branch?

316
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:20,381
From HQ.

317
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:24,010
Gosh, we apologize for dragging this on

318
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:26,554
when it shouldn't be this complicated.

319
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,724
We had so many things to take care of.

320
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,769
This case isn't serious enough
for HQ to send someone.

321
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:35,063
Can I leave now?

322
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:41,903
I heard you've worked hard until now.

323
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,204
Here.

324
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:57,960
PRIVATE AGENCY WORKER
FOUND DEAD IN YOUNGIN RESERVOIR

325
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,341
What game are you playing here?!

326
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,237
Goodness.

327
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:30,117
Listen.

328
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:36,082
Don't strain yourself too much.
The drug will spread faster.

329
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:45,133
I guess the company was losing patience.

330
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:53,683
My brother died…

331
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:58,062
on the cold floor of a swimming pool.

332
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:03,943
And his body was even colder
when they found him.

333
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:08,698
You…

334
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:22,409
They want a new man on the job.

335
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:29,719
Who ordered you to do this?

336
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,054
I'm not sure.

337
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:43,732
Right.

338
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,281
What was it?

339
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:52,241
I…

340
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:55,286
Dislike people who aren't idealistic.

341
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:03,127
Goodbye, then.

342
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:24,689
I can hear you.

343
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:33,199
My house and this place

344
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,743
both look suffocating.

345
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:40,122
Do you think Seo Hye-eun will show up

346
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:41,457
to meet you?

347
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:44,502
That lady believes she's smart.

348
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:47,171
When she realizes
that everything is pointing to her,

349
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:48,923
she'll come to face me head-on.

350
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:53,219
And she'll want to know
if the cops have hard evidence.

351
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,479
- How was your visit?
- Good.

352
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:06,607
What about Mr. Kim?

353
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:10,979
I'm sure this is hard on him.

354
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:13,531
It's not an easy choice to make.

355
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:18,703
Anyway, any updates
on the investigation of Seo Hye-eun?

356
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,331
Our officers are everywhere,
including the airport

357
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:24,125
bus terminals, and docks.

358
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:26,419
It won't be easy to flee the country.

359
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:30,636
I guess I'm the only one
with a job left to do.

360
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:33,092
Right.

361
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:35,070
These are the investigation materials
you asked for.

362
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,096
- Thank you.
- The laptop and pendant are there too.

363
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:50,109
<i>Will you carry all that burden?</i>

364
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,195
About Ro-hee's memories…

365
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,698
What if her memories come back,

366
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,783
and they point to Ms. Seo Hye-eun?

367
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:00,786
What will you do then?

368
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,581
Then…

369
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:07,835
I'll follow Ro-hee's decision.

370
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,730
I looked into it, and it's a mess.

371
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:30,775
They're searching all the boats
that are leaving.

372
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:34,028
No matter how much you pay us,

373
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:35,791
no one can leave in a situation like this.

374
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:39,075
Lay low for a few days.

375
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:40,701
I'll let you know when to leave.

376
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,161
Then when…

377
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,038
I'll call you.

378
00:27:56,092 --> 00:28:02,264
RESTRICTED NUMBER

379
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:06,227
<i>It's me, Choi Ro-hee.</i>

380
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:40,970
MAP OF YOUNGIN

381
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:12,710
So this was why…

382
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:16,589
Dad was planning to take me to Singapore.

383
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:39,612
Hey.

384
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:43,157
Thank you for your cooperation.

385
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,410
No need to thank me.
It wasn't my decision.

386
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:54,543
Just keep in mind that we'll have to
turn in our badges if this plan fails.

387
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:56,962
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

388
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,007
Hey, Detective Jang.

389
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:03,469
If you want to keep your badge,
we should all share the burden

390
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,471
and not hog all the work.

391
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:06,764
You can…

392
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:09,475
trust our ace detectives here.

393
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:21,654
Thank you.
I know it was a hard decision to make.

394
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:24,532
Don't worry about it.

395
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:28,327
This is the only thing
I can do for Ro-hee.

396
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:03,279
Ms. Seo Hye-eun is here.

397
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:15,666
Stay on your toes.

398
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,418
In any event, we'll ambush her.

399
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:14,933
Over here.

400
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:30,658
It's been a while.

401
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:33,494
How are you feeling?

402
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:36,538
Not bad, thanks to you.

403
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:38,207
Are you alone?

404
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,667
You think I'm alone?

405
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,461
Don't you know there are people
waiting for you?

406
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,637
Did you call the cops
in case I do something to you?

407
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:53,180
Don't tell me

408
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:57,226
you thought I called you
without any preparation.

409
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,562
How am I supposed to know?

410
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,981
Thank you for coming
despite knowing everything.

411
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:05,859
I thought I'd visit you at prison.

412
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:09,238
You were sending me signals,
so I had to respond.

413
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:10,948
Of course, I came.

414
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:14,159
<i>Hello.</i>

415
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,829
<i>We should clear up any misunderstandings</i>

416
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:19,164
<i>and false information.</i>

417
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:26,630
That's why you invited me, right?

418
00:33:27,131 --> 00:33:29,091
Impressive, as I thought.

419
00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:31,593
You want some tea?

420
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:33,762
No, let's make this short.

421
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:35,055
So?

422
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:37,057
What do you remember?

423
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:39,560
You must've been curious.

424
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,228
That's why I came.

425
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:45,023
The fact that I've regained my memories

426
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:49,528
means that I remember your presence
the moment I left the house.

427
00:33:57,578 --> 00:33:59,997
Yes, I gave him the idea to kidnap you.

428
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,749
I needed money.

429
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:06,587
I was thinking of turning myself in.

430
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:11,675
I couldn't let Myeong-jun
carry all that burden.

431
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:15,721
So I deserve to be punished

432
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:18,182
for providing information.

433
00:34:20,184 --> 00:34:22,770
But murder?

434
00:34:23,187 --> 00:34:24,229
Listen.

435
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:27,649
You barked up the wrong tree,
Ms. Choi Ro-hee.

436
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:31,236
Ms. Seo.

437
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,614
Mr. Kim thought long and hard

438
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:37,534
about whether to protect you or me.

439
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:39,619
But…

440
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:43,457
he gave me this before getting arrested.

441
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,671
I guess Mr. Kim…

442
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:54,259
chose me instead of you.

443
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,387
You spent so much time with him,

444
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:01,141
but you still don't know him, do you?

445
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:04,102
Kim Myeong-jun…

446
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:06,438
can never abandon

447
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:08,982
Seo Hye-eun.

448
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:14,112
He must've given you this
since it's meaningless.

449
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:16,156
So? What did you see in the footage?

450
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:19,034
My visit to your house?

451
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:20,993
I hope you don't think

452
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:24,206
that's enough to frame me as the murderer.

453
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:27,292
How did it feel watching our house?

454
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,837
You must know my family more than I do.

455
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:33,090
It looked like you met my dad quite often

456
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:36,468
and went to his hospital
and blackmailed him.

457
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:41,348
You're the woman from the funeral.

458
00:35:42,558 --> 00:35:45,185
How's the experiment going?

459
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,272
Is your child doing well?

460
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,441
What are you talking about?

461
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,946
How much…

462
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:58,657
do you think I know?

463
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:04,288
<i>I'm sure my dad
spent quite a bit of hush money</i>

464
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:06,123
<i>to keep you quiet.</i>

465
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:12,504
<i>But despite that, you probably
still felt that it was unfair.</i>

466
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,080
<i>In fact, I'm sure you felt
that it was even more unfair.</i>

467
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,676
<i>It isn't easy</i>

468
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,887
<i>to root out the greed in your heart.</i>

469
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,722
Get out.

470
00:36:23,891 --> 00:36:26,602
I have nothing to give you, so get out!

471
00:36:27,311 --> 00:36:28,311
Oh my.

472
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,063
Are you saying

473
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:33,901
the world can know
what the great Dr. Choi Jin-tae

474
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:35,861
is doing to his daughter?

475
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:37,696
Isn't money what you want?

476
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,531
I believe I gave you enough.

477
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:40,866
"Enough"?

478
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:43,993
Hey.

479
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:47,331
Who are you to decide that?

480
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:49,750
Who are you to decide that

481
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,793
- when you ruined my life?
- Get out.

482
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:52,877
Get out!

483
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:55,005
I don't have time
to waste on you, you lunatic!

484
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:56,590
- Get out!
- Let go!

485
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:59,009
- You bastard! Who are you to decide that?
- Get out!

486
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:16,568
<i>Since that incident,</i>

487
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:19,655
<i>a rumor that you and my dad
were in an affair started spreading.</i>

488
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:21,740
To my dad,

489
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,077
you were probably the worst nuisance
after my mom.

490
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:28,497
That's why on the day of the incident,
the CCTVs were disabled,

491
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,707
and my dad invited you to our house.

492
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:32,834
What a great story, Ro-hee.

493
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:36,505
You're not only clever

494
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:40,175
but full of imagination.

495
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:07,744
Is your wife not home?

496
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:09,621
I don't see your daughter either.

497
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:10,872
They're out.

498
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:13,250
- Please come this way.
- Okay.

499
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:39,735
You seem rather serious.

500
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:41,903
I wonder what you have to offer.

501
00:38:42,738 --> 00:38:45,323
Let's hear what it is that you want.

502
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:48,660
Please wait. I'll get some tea.

503
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:01,048
<i>When my dad left the room,</i>

504
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:03,800
<i>you must've gone for
the research materials in his safe.</i>

505
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:07,554
<i>You knew that it was far more valuable
than the money my dad could offer.</i>

506
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:34,664
<i>But you locked eyes with my dad,
who came back faster than expected.</i>

507
00:39:34,748 --> 00:39:37,292
- What are you doing?
<i>- And he was probably trying to kill you.</i>

508
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,716
A rumor is spreading
that we're having an affair.

509
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,634
What?

510
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,594
You sneaked into my house while I was out

511
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:49,471
and had a fight with my wife.

512
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:52,015
And unfortunately,
both women lost their lives.

513
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,560
You murderous bastard.

514
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:16,247
Why?

515
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:18,232
Are you going to stab me with that?

516
00:40:19,543 --> 00:40:20,961
Have you stabbed anyone before?

517
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:22,837
Do it.

518
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:32,055
Anyone who interferes with my research

519
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:35,892
doesn't deserve to live!

520
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:14,723
Impressive, Choi Ro-hee.

521
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,933
Great job.

522
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:18,977
What a great story.

523
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:22,647
You haven't been remembering anything,

524
00:41:22,856 --> 00:41:24,065
but writing novels instead.

525
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:27,444
Well, it took me a while
to go through the materials,

526
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,571
but this isn't enough
to become a bestseller.

527
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:32,782
Why?

528
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:34,868
Are you curious about what happens next?

529
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:36,369
No.

530
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,122
I've lost interest.

531
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:43,001
I anticipated a lot before coming here,

532
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:46,838
but the story's quite disappointing.

533
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,800
Ro-hee.

534
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,053
Go ahead.

535
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:56,848
Are you sure

536
00:41:57,724 --> 00:41:59,434
you regained your memories?

537
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:03,939
You can't just poke around
based on your imagination.

538
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:06,024
Why not?

539
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:08,735
Is something wrong with my memory?

540
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:19,287
There's no right or wrong.

541
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:22,540
It's just your imagination.

542
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,252
Keep on writing

543
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:27,796
so you can write a bestseller.

544
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,216
Not everyone can do that.

545
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:33,885
I'd need a story like yours.

546
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:43,603
How dare you talk about my story
when you don't even know me?

547
00:42:44,688 --> 00:42:46,022
Choi Dong-eok… No.

548
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:51,695
My grandpa wanted to adopt
Myeong-jun at first.

549
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:54,948
But you became greedy

550
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:57,284
and coaxed Mr. Kim
and was adopted into this family.

551
00:42:57,993 --> 00:43:01,496
But it probably didn't matter
who he adopted,

552
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,373
whether it was you or Mr. Kim.

553
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:05,959
He just wanted a decent subject.

554
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:10,338
He decided that you were
a suitable candidate,

555
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:11,798
so you were adopted.

556
00:43:12,841 --> 00:43:15,427
But happiness didn't last long.

557
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:17,512
Your nightmare began.

558
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:22,017
You injured your neck due to the scalpel
Mr. Park Cheol-won wielded

559
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:24,060
and was infected with HIV.

560
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:25,519
Right.

561
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:27,939
And you were disowned.

562
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:31,026
ADOPTED, DISOWNED, ADOPTED, DISOWNED

563
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,070
<i>You were adopted again,</i>

564
00:43:34,154 --> 00:43:36,990
<i>but you were disowned
due to your stepfather's abuse.</i>

565
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:41,119
You lived in the orphanage since then
and graduated high school.

566
00:43:41,745 --> 00:43:44,414
You were able to graduate,

567
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:46,666
thanks to Mr. Park Cheol-won's donations.

568
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,048
I mean, what a twist of fate.

569
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:55,759
What a heartbreaking relationship
you guys have.

570
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:58,970
How ridiculous.

571
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:00,388
Ms. Seo.

572
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:04,517
Mr. Park Cheol-won
is behind bars for your murder,

573
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:07,604
and Mr. Kim was taken advantage of by you

574
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:10,148
and is in jail for kidnapping.

575
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:14,194
But there's something
I'm really curious about.

576
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:19,574
Mr. Kim caused you no harm whatsoever.

577
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:22,660
He was just used by you.

578
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:25,872
So why did it have to be him?

579
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:34,255
Are you curious?

580
00:44:37,217 --> 00:44:39,010
You said everything yourself.

581
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:45,350
The experiment that was conducted on me.

582
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:49,270
The pain and discrimination.

583
00:44:51,106 --> 00:44:53,316
They were all
Myeong-jun's crosses to bear.

584
00:44:54,234 --> 00:44:55,610
But I carried it instead,

585
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:58,780
so Myeong-jun should pay the price too.

586
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:02,492
So you're pinning the cause
of all unhappiness to him?

587
00:45:03,827 --> 00:45:05,745
Mr. Kim is such a fool.

588
00:45:06,663 --> 00:45:10,041
He's positive in every way, unlike you.

589
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:13,169
He was happy
that Hee-ae's surgery went well,

590
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:15,338
that you aren't sick,

591
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:17,674
and that I returned home.

592
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:20,009
But he still has to pay the price

593
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:23,179
when he did nothing wrong?

594
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:27,142
He did nothing wrong?

595
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:36,943
No, not yet.

596
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,282
Then what did I do wrong?

597
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:44,701
What did I do so wrong

598
00:45:44,993 --> 00:45:47,620
that I got HIV
and became an experimental subject?

599
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:50,331
I lived all my life in pain.

600
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,500
What about you?

601
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:55,420
You must know.

602
00:45:56,463 --> 00:45:57,630
The world punishes you…

603
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:01,801
even if you do nothing wrong.

604
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:04,804
Do you think the both of us
committed any wrong?

605
00:46:05,138 --> 00:46:06,306
What did you do so wrong

606
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:08,600
that you were put to sleep, tested…

607
00:46:09,476 --> 00:46:10,518
Do you…

608
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:13,605
Do you know how many times
I had to shave my head?

609
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,774
He opened up my skull

610
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:20,195
and performed on my brain.

611
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:22,739
I couldn't even go to school.

612
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:27,410
I was stuck in that dark,
underground laboratory.

613
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:31,664
I tried so hard to be loved
and get his approval.

614
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:35,627
I endured on and on.

615
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:37,128
I know.

616
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:39,172
I was the same.

617
00:46:40,006 --> 00:46:43,176
I went through that longer than you did.

618
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:49,224
We're not the same.

619
00:46:51,351 --> 00:46:54,354
You were rewarded for your pain.

620
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,024
A luxurious house, decent parents,

621
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:03,029
and everyone tells you
that you're great, important, and smart.

622
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:06,032
They put you on a pedestal.

623
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:07,492
What about me?

624
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:09,536
What did I get in return?

625
00:47:09,619 --> 00:47:10,619
Nothing.

626
00:47:11,913 --> 00:47:12,997
Absolutely…

627
00:47:14,207 --> 00:47:15,291
nothing.

628
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:16,375
Why?

629
00:47:16,668 --> 00:47:19,003
All because of you and your dad!

630
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:21,464
You took everything from me!

631
00:47:21,673 --> 00:47:24,133
You took everything that was mine!

632
00:47:26,553 --> 00:47:27,595
I can't take it!

633
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:29,556
I can't take it!

634
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:34,519
What choice do you think I had?

635
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:37,605
I had to take care of myself.

636
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:39,524
I had to protect myself.

637
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:43,236
You still think you and I are the same?

638
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:44,320
Yes.

639
00:47:45,113 --> 00:47:48,575
Both of our dads were crazy.

640
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:01,129
Thank you for abandoning
Mr. Kim and Hee-ae.

641
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:03,923
I have a new family, thanks to you.

642
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:16,728
You're taking something from me again!

643
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:18,771
You're taking what's mine again!

644
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:21,274
Choi Ro-hee, listen carefully.

645
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:24,152
Myeong-jun and Hee-ae are both mine.

646
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:26,904
Whether I abandon them or keep them,

647
00:48:26,988 --> 00:48:28,865
I'm the one who owns them!

648
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:31,409
I'd rather kill them both
than give them to you!

649
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:33,661
But isn't it better for Hee-ae

650
00:48:33,745 --> 00:48:36,831
to not have a mom who murders people?

651
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:40,585
Didn't I tell you
your dad is the murderer?

652
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:42,795
Your dad killed your mom.

653
00:48:42,879 --> 00:48:44,422
Then he tried to kill me

654
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:46,966
and pin your mom's death on me!

655
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:47,967
What?

656
00:48:48,051 --> 00:48:50,345
Hee-ae won't need a mom
who murders people?

657
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,895
Then you should get on your knees
and thank me.

658
00:48:59,729 --> 00:49:03,733
Since I'm the one
who killed your mad scientist dad!

659
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,110
I see.

660
00:49:07,737 --> 00:49:08,737
Are you sure?

661
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:12,282
What?

662
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:17,162
<i>What?</i>

663
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:21,292
Arrest her.

664
00:49:34,097 --> 00:49:37,016
I get why my grandpa chose you.

665
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:39,769
I guess he liked how crazy you are.

666
00:49:40,687 --> 00:49:43,564
It's time for you to get punished.

667
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:54,367
I thought of two scenarios

668
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:56,911
on my way here.

669
00:49:57,537 --> 00:49:59,330
Leaving this place safely

670
00:49:59,414 --> 00:50:02,291
and never leaving this place.

671
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:05,071
What if I never leave this place?

672
00:50:06,963 --> 00:50:07,964
Do I kill you?

673
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:11,801
Or do I set this place on fire
and die together?

674
00:50:12,385 --> 00:50:15,888
Then I thought of a great way
to get my revenge!

675
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:25,064
I wanted someone in your family

676
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:27,859
to suffer the same pain

677
00:50:28,443 --> 00:50:30,486
that I suffered.

678
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:36,284
It's time for you to suffer.

679
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:40,121
Experience the pain
that I suffered all my life.

680
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:41,247
Ms. Seo Hye-eun!

681
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:47,795
Drop the scalpel.

682
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:49,505
Stop it. It's over.

683
00:50:50,423 --> 00:50:51,549
Drop the scalpel!

684
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:52,633
Don't come any closer!

685
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:53,718
Drop the gun!

686
00:50:54,427 --> 00:50:56,679
Drop the gun! Don't come near me!

687
00:50:56,763 --> 00:50:57,847
Hye-eun!

688
00:51:01,601 --> 00:51:03,019
Mr. Kim, stand back.

689
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:08,024
Why are you here?

690
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:09,901
Stand back.

691
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:17,825
Stop.

692
00:51:20,495 --> 00:51:21,537
Don't do it.

693
00:51:26,626 --> 00:51:27,710
Stop right there.

694
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:31,756
I can stab you too! Don't come near me!

695
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:33,966
Myeong-jun, stop.

696
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:35,885
Don't come near me!

697
00:51:37,053 --> 00:51:38,179
Please.

698
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:41,891
I said don't come near me!

699
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:43,893
Hye-eun.

700
00:51:44,936 --> 00:51:47,313
Don't come near me!

701
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:54,319
Let go.

702
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:56,446
Let go of me.

703
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:58,199
Let go!

704
00:51:58,491 --> 00:51:59,992
Why are you here?

705
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:01,284
Why?!

706
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:03,663
These were all mine!

707
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:05,122
Everything was mine!

708
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:06,999
Get out of my house!

709
00:52:07,083 --> 00:52:08,334
Hye-eun!

710
00:52:10,503 --> 00:52:11,671
Stop it.

711
00:52:13,548 --> 00:52:16,092
Please stop.

712
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:20,346
Stop and come with me, okay?

713
00:52:21,097 --> 00:52:22,515
Lay all your burdens here,

714
00:52:23,683 --> 00:52:25,518
and let's go.

715
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:27,728
No one…

716
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:32,316
ever loved me.

717
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:35,945
You're going to hate me too, right?

718
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:39,114
No.

719
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:41,993
No, Hye-eun.

720
00:52:43,995 --> 00:52:47,582
I've never hated you.

721
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:51,794
Even now and in the future,
I'll never hate you.

722
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:55,131
That day at church,

723
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:58,050
you asked me what I prayed for, right?

724
00:53:02,138 --> 00:53:03,973
My family.

725
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:07,101
Our daughter, Hee-ae…

726
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:10,354
and Hye-eun.

727
00:53:13,024 --> 00:53:18,154
I pray every single day…

728
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,867
for your health and happiness.

729
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:25,119
But Hye-eun…

730
00:53:26,329 --> 00:53:27,330
Ro-hee…

731
00:53:28,623 --> 00:53:30,541
is my family now.

732
00:53:31,876 --> 00:53:34,837
I can't watch…

733
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,965
my family get hurt anymore.

734
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:40,176
Please…

735
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:43,804
Let's stop.

736
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:36,773
<i>We will now share</i>

737
00:54:36,816 --> 00:54:40,403
the results of the Youngin Hospital
Director and Wife Murder Case

738
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:44,490
and the kidnapping case
of their daughter, Choi Ro-hee.

739
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:49,161
The suspect in the murder
that occurred on May 20th, 2023,

740
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:50,579
is a woman

741
00:54:50,663 --> 00:54:53,791
who was adopted and then disowned
by Dr. Choi Jin-tae's father 30 years ago.

742
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:57,253
She also planned the kidnapping
that happened the day after.

743
00:54:58,546 --> 00:55:01,048
After murdering the director
of Hyekwang Hospital on the 20th,

744
00:55:01,132 --> 00:55:03,634
she ordered her ex-husband

745
00:55:03,718 --> 00:55:06,178
to kidnap Choi Ro-hee the next day.

746
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:11,517
However, guilt overcame the kidnapper,
so he turned himself in and was arrested.

747
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:13,394
We were able to arrest

748
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:18,065
the murder suspect during the meeting
with the kidnapper at the scene.

749
00:55:18,274 --> 00:55:20,735
Why did the culprit commit these crimes?

750
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:24,280
According to the rumors, they say
it's related to Dr. Choi's research.

751
00:55:24,363 --> 00:55:25,489
Is that true?

752
00:55:25,573 --> 00:55:27,783
Well, the motivation behind the crime is…

753
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:46,886
Dr. Choi Jin-tae's

754
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:48,929
wealth.

755
00:55:53,184 --> 00:55:55,895
The defendant had the child
kidnapped for 20 days.

756
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,731
Even if he didn't cause
any harm to the child,

757
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:01,817
the motivation and reason
for the crime are clear.

758
00:56:03,027 --> 00:56:04,445
As such,

759
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:06,947
the prosecution
demands a ten-year sentence

760
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:10,951
for kidnapping Choi Ro-hee, a minor.

761
00:56:13,913 --> 00:56:15,623
Thank you for your statement.

762
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:18,584
Are you present, Ms. Choi Ro-hee?

763
00:56:24,632 --> 00:56:27,218
I heard you requested
to propose a statement.

764
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:29,036
Do you think you can step forward?

765
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:48,656
WITNESS

766
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:51,867
Is Ms. Choi Ro-hee's witness intermediary
present as well?

767
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:54,577
Yes, Your Honor.

768
00:56:57,665 --> 00:57:01,961
I don't need a witness intermediary
who distorts my statements.

769
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:06,257
All of my statements so far

770
00:57:06,674 --> 00:57:08,843
were modified by them.

771
00:57:09,552 --> 00:57:12,388
I request that you remove
those from the reference materials.

772
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:17,893
Ms. Choi, these are the rules.

773
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:20,980
We know that you're smart,

774
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:23,274
but you must
abide by the rules of the court.

775
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:29,488
Then you can be the judge of my statement.

776
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:36,287
COUNSELOR, DEFENDANT

777
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:42,918
Sure.

778
00:57:43,002 --> 00:57:44,211
Go ahead.

779
00:57:48,591 --> 00:57:50,551
On May 21st,

780
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:53,888
I collapsed near my house
and experienced short-term memory loss

781
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:55,764
as the anesthetics hadn't worn off.

782
00:57:57,183 --> 00:57:59,768
Mr. Kim Myeong-jun took me
while I was unconscious,

783
00:58:00,352 --> 00:58:01,729
and he took care of…

784
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:09,778
Are you okay?

785
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:13,282
Are you scared

786
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:15,409
to face your kidnapper?

787
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:25,252
No.

788
00:58:32,635 --> 00:58:33,928
I've never been scared…

789
00:58:35,888 --> 00:58:37,556
of him.

790
00:58:58,535 --> 00:58:59,745
What do I have to do…

791
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:03,040
to release him?

792
00:59:05,668 --> 00:59:06,794
Your Honor.

793
00:59:07,503 --> 00:59:09,380
The victim is still a minor,

794
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,524
and she spent a lot of time
with the defendant,

795
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:14,635
which is enough time for him
to draw emotional sympathy from her.

796
00:59:15,386 --> 00:59:17,054
I'll be the judge of that.

797
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:20,723
Keep going.

798
00:59:22,518 --> 00:59:24,186
"Emotional sympathy."

799
00:59:26,647 --> 00:59:29,191
He isn't capable of such a thing.

800
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:33,696
He shudders whenever I speak

801
00:59:35,281 --> 00:59:37,032
and does everything I say.

802
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:41,120
You have no idea
how much he cared about me.

803
00:59:46,709 --> 00:59:48,294
The time that I spent with him…

804
00:59:50,671 --> 00:59:52,548
was special.

805
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:57,303
No one treated me the way he did before.

806
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:03,017
Your Honor.

807
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:06,271
I know it's ridiculous
to ask you to release him.

808
01:00:07,855 --> 01:00:09,690
Mr. Kim kidnapped me.

809
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:12,609
That's a fact.

810
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:16,447
But what is kidnapping?

811
01:00:18,157 --> 01:00:20,784
If kidnapping is trickery, intimidation,

812
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:24,079
and limiting my freedom,

813
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:27,750
then the time I was kidnapped

814
01:00:28,876 --> 01:00:32,546
was the moment I was born
until May 23, 2023.

815
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:37,176
I had the most freedom in my life…

816
01:00:41,055 --> 01:00:43,265
during the time I spent with Mr. Kim.

817
01:00:55,194 --> 01:00:56,194
Are you okay?

818
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:03,160
She's here.

819
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,877
A promise is a promise.

820
01:01:15,214 --> 01:01:17,800
I read through
my dad's research materials.

821
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:19,885
Every single word.

822
01:01:20,386 --> 01:01:22,054
And? What's this?

823
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:27,518
You were always curious

824
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:29,395
if my dad's research succeeded or not.

825
01:01:29,937 --> 01:01:31,397
I think this might help.

826
01:01:37,778 --> 01:01:39,947
No genius is ever happy.

827
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:43,659
The future that you imagine for Byeol

828
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:46,453
may not mean anything to her.

829
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,606
Right, Ro-hee.

830
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:23,239
Here.

831
01:02:24,408 --> 01:02:25,451
What about this?

832
01:02:25,576 --> 01:02:28,829
Mr. Kim Myeong-jun asked me
to give this to you.

833
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:33,876
You should rest. It was a long day.

834
01:02:34,168 --> 01:02:36,753
You'll be busy tomorrow
with the hospital director meeting.

835
01:02:39,548 --> 01:02:41,175
Thank you for today, Attorney Choi.

836
01:02:42,551 --> 01:02:43,552
You're welcome.

837
01:03:04,823 --> 01:03:07,743
TO MY FILIAL DAUGHTER, RO-HEE

838
01:03:08,035 --> 01:03:09,286
Feels nice, right?

839
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:10,536
Yes.

840
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:14,249
- Come on, try it...
- No!

841
01:03:14,917 --> 01:03:17,198
Don't you dare try to feed me
that disgusting thing again!

842
01:03:17,628 --> 01:03:19,254
Are you really my dad?

843
01:03:21,215 --> 01:03:22,257
Why are you taking that?

844
01:03:22,424 --> 01:03:23,675
This saved me too.

845
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:26,345
I feel at peace when I have this.

846
01:04:31,326 --> 01:04:34,788
Why didn't you file an appeal?

847
01:04:38,292 --> 01:04:39,876
I killed someone.

848
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:43,338
You saw what I did to Dr. Yoon.

849
01:04:46,717 --> 01:04:48,719
Why did you take it so far?

850
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:51,555
You sacrificed so much
for Ms. Seo Hye-eun.

851
01:04:52,556 --> 01:04:56,226
You even paid
for her daughter's hospital bills.

852
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,609
I've always thought…

853
01:05:05,027 --> 01:05:07,613
that money
was reserved for times like that.

854
01:05:08,196 --> 01:05:10,157
What do you mean by that?

855
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,661
It was my wife's insurance money.

856
01:05:22,878 --> 01:05:24,463
Don't you regret any of this?

857
01:05:33,555 --> 01:05:35,223
You should set yourself free now.

858
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:38,935
The burden on your shoulders,

859
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:41,647
and the shackles…

860
01:05:45,651 --> 01:05:47,527
on your hands and feet.

861
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,492
It's time…

862
01:05:55,994 --> 01:05:57,329
you free yourself from them.

863
01:06:08,757 --> 01:06:09,925
Thank you.

864
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:34,616
What do I do?

865
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,368
What do I do?

866
01:06:37,452 --> 01:06:38,495
Mr. Park.

867
01:06:41,289 --> 01:06:42,499
Hye-eun.

868
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:46,378
What do I do?

869
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:06,231
Get changed and take my car.

870
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:08,734
I'll take care of this.

871
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:22,998
Mr. Park.

872
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:30,255
What's with the girl?

873
01:07:30,839 --> 01:07:34,468
She saw me while I was cleaning up.

874
01:07:41,016 --> 01:07:42,684
Come this way.

875
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,323
Hye-eun.

876
01:07:58,283 --> 01:07:59,284
Hye-eun.

877
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:02,913
Stop.

878
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:05,123
It'll complicate things
if she wakes up in the middle.

879
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:21,139
Don't wake up.

880
01:08:22,057 --> 01:08:23,225
If you wake up…

881
01:08:26,061 --> 01:08:28,396
I'll have no choice but to kill you.

882
01:09:06,852 --> 01:09:07,936
Why are you here again?!

883
01:09:08,103 --> 01:09:09,312
Sit down.

884
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:11,690
- Hello.
- Hello.

885
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,567
You come so often.

886
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:20,282
You still look so shabby.

887
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:22,492
What do you mean?

888
01:09:25,036 --> 01:09:26,246
Wear this.

889
01:09:28,206 --> 01:09:29,249
A headband?

890
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:39,259
Oh my, this is nice.

891
01:09:39,384 --> 01:09:40,969
You look better now.

892
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:42,929
I should've worn this earlier.

893
01:09:45,974 --> 01:09:47,183
It's about Hee-ae.

894
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:49,412
I'm planning to transfer her
to an international school

895
01:09:49,436 --> 01:09:50,437
when she gets discharged.

896
01:09:51,021 --> 01:09:52,939
The process is a bit complicated,

897
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,903
but I think there'll be a way
if I look into it.

898
01:09:56,026 --> 01:09:57,068
Does she want to go?

899
01:09:57,152 --> 01:09:58,486
Who is she to decide that?

900
01:09:58,570 --> 01:10:00,113
The person paying for it does.

901
01:10:00,989 --> 01:10:03,825
She needs to want to do it.

902
01:10:03,909 --> 01:10:06,828
Nothing good comes
from spoiling kids like that.

903
01:10:07,495 --> 01:10:10,123
You can't live all your life
only doing what you want.

904
01:10:10,624 --> 01:10:11,625
Am I wrong?

905
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:15,295
You need to do what you dislike
to make money and live a good life.

906
01:10:15,503 --> 01:10:18,173
Gosh, I can't win
an argument with you, can I?

907
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:21,509
Can kids come in like this
when I'm meeting my attorney?

908
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:23,428
- It's not allowed.
- Why not?

909
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:26,765
I said you should take responsibility
for your actions, right?

910
01:10:27,182 --> 01:10:30,101
Why are you complaining about my visits
when you do nothing in there?

911
01:10:30,185 --> 01:10:32,729
We promised to play soccer.

912
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:34,814
I play an important position.

913
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:36,441
What is this, the World Cup?

914
01:10:37,067 --> 01:10:38,735
Yes, it is!

915
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:39,861
Jeez.

916
01:10:40,445 --> 01:10:43,740
All right, let's say Hee-ae's
going to an international school.

917
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:45,742
What about you?

918
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:47,160
Me? What about me?

919
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:48,363
Are you not going to school?

920
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:49,704
Why would I?

921
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,791
The school would hate to have me
as a student.

922
01:10:53,083 --> 01:10:55,502
Hey, you need to go to school to learn.

923
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:56,920
What more could I possibly learn?

924
01:10:58,088 --> 01:10:59,923
Your worst subject!

925
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:00,840
Social skills.

926
01:11:00,924 --> 01:11:03,635
Social skills?
What about my social skills?

927
01:11:05,095 --> 01:11:07,597
- Do you agree with him?
- Yes.

928
01:11:09,349 --> 01:11:11,267
- Let's go to school.
- Absolutely not.

929
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:12,560
- Please.
- Forget it.

930
01:11:12,644 --> 01:11:15,480
Fine, I'm going to go train for my game.

931
01:11:16,106 --> 01:11:17,106
Mr. Kim.

932
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:19,024
What?

933
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:29,452
I'm sorry.

934
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:33,081
And thank you.

935
01:11:45,385 --> 01:11:48,221
Gosh, you have
so many things to thank me for.

936
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:49,556
- Darn you!
- Hey!

937
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:50,890
Hey!

938
01:11:50,974 --> 01:11:52,475
That's not made of bamboo! It hurts!

939
01:11:52,559 --> 01:11:54,102
That's why I hit you!

940
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:57,022
Let me hit you with that too then.

941
01:11:57,105 --> 01:11:58,690
- Come here.
- Wait.

942
01:11:58,773 --> 01:11:59,983
- Give it!
- Hold on.

943
01:12:00,358 --> 01:12:02,235
- Goodness.
- Give it to me!

944
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:03,862
- Give it!
- I got it.

945
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:05,905
- Seriously!
- Give this to me.

946
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:09,617
Can't I sue her for this? Seriously.

947
01:12:09,701 --> 01:12:11,828
- I promise I won't hit him.
- Okay.

948
01:12:12,537 --> 01:12:13,663
Hey!

949
01:12:19,586 --> 01:12:20,670
All right.

950
01:12:25,216 --> 01:12:26,416
Why are you smiling like that?

951
01:12:27,302 --> 01:12:28,762
This kind of suits you.

952
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:31,431
Stop staring at me. It's embarrassing.

953
01:12:33,016 --> 01:12:35,977
Let's go. I hate not being on time.

954
01:12:36,186 --> 01:12:37,312
Okay.

955
01:12:39,606 --> 01:12:41,441
Ro-hee, do you want this hairpin?

956
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:42,859
Can you not?

957
01:12:42,942 --> 01:12:44,110
I think it'll suit you.

958
01:12:44,194 --> 01:12:46,404
It doesn't, so stop it.

959
01:12:46,654 --> 01:12:48,740
Ro-hee, please.

960
01:12:49,574 --> 01:12:51,701
You sound like your dad
whenever you're like this.

961
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:55,830
We have a new student.

962
01:12:56,164 --> 01:12:59,292
This is her first time in school,
so you guys will help her, right?

963
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,794
- Yes!
- Yes!

964
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:04,089
Ro-hee, why don't you introduce yourself?

965
01:13:09,803 --> 01:13:11,221
My name is Choi Ro-hee.

966
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,723
I live in Youngin-dong 23.

967
01:13:14,432 --> 01:13:17,102
I'm not telling you this
for you to come visit.

968
01:13:18,353 --> 01:13:21,898
According to my attorney,
I have about 100 billion won.

969
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:26,111
Of course,
that's including my real estate,

970
01:13:26,194 --> 01:13:28,071
shares, bonds, and savings.

971
01:13:29,197 --> 01:13:31,491
I own the Hyekwang Hospital building,

972
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:33,034
but the bank owns half of…

973
01:13:44,295 --> 01:13:47,006
<i>Hey, you need to go to school to learn.</i>

974
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:49,008
<i>Your worst subject!</i>

975
01:13:49,092 --> 01:13:50,092
<i>Social skills.</i>

976
01:13:55,515 --> 01:13:56,515
Hello.

977
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,144
I'm Choi Ro-hee, and I'm 12 years old.

978
01:13:59,727 --> 01:14:01,271
I lack social skills.

979
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:04,440
I hope you guys can help me.

980
01:14:04,983 --> 01:14:06,543
I look forward to hanging out with you.
