00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,663
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS, GROUPS,

2
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:04,448
AND SETTINGS ARE FICTITIOUS,
AND CHILD SAFETY GUIDELINES WERE FOLLOWED

3
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,082
I'm a cop.

4
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:28,839
Did you not hear?

5
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:30,966
I'm a cop. Drop your weapon!

6
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,096
Stop right there, you rat!

7
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:54,532
I just fired two blanks.

8
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,242
The next one is a real bullet.

9
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:58,702
Drop your weapons.

10
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,501
Put your hands behind your head
and lean against the car.

11
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,179
Where's Choi Ro-hee?

12
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,934
You bastard, are you upset or what?

13
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,727
Stop staring!

14
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,273
Tell us what you know...

15
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:29,525
at the station.

16
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:38,993
Damn it.

17
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:42,162
I found you, you mole.

18
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:45,875
Get out.

19
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,138
I knew something was off.

20
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:02,224
A kidnapper calls a rookie attorney

21
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:03,601
who's a contract employee?

22
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:06,729
I know you knew Ro-hee in the past,
but it's too out of the blue.

23
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,606
After all, I have Ro-hee.

24
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,108
I knew you would've gotten help.

25
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,568
So I was certain

26
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,112
that there was a mole.

27
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,367
A woman with a calm voice.

28
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,247
I knew it sounded familiar.

29
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,835
Why didn't I suspect you first?

30
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,381
All right. It's my fault.

31
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,179
Since you have to find out

32
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:43,933
the drug that Choi Ro-hee was constantly
injected with and the virus chart,

33
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:45,809
I'll keep you alive for the time being.

34
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,438
Tell me why you should live.

35
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:53,067
Time is ticking.

36
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,699
- Damn.
- You missed.

37
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,619
You said you were good at shooting.

38
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:06,121
- Of course, in a game.
- Are you...

39
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:08,040
- What...
- Then you shoot!

40
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,667
Are you telling a kid to use a gun?

41
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:13,796
Drop the gun, Jackson.

42
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,047
It's "Jaden."

43
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,049
- Right, Jason.
- It's "Jaden"!

44
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,051
It's Jaden?

45
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,636
What a confusing name.

46
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,638
Both of us are pointing guns

47
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,250
and you're telling me to drop it?

48
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:26,100
That's why I brought this.

49
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:31,480
Hey, it's dangerous. Give it to them!

50
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,531
Can't win now, can you?

51
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,614
Drop the gun.

52
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:51,333
Dr. Mo.

53
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,716
All right, it's your turn to talk.

54
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:00,676
Why should we let you live?

55
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:06,890
Nothing to say, right?

56
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,518
You think human lives
are worthless, don't you?

57
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:12,521
Tomorrow morning,

58
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:15,399
you'll go to the police station with us.

59
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:16,942
We should pay for what we've done.

60
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,319
You and I both.

61
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,781
I don't know what you want,

62
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:24,241
but you better give up.

63
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,535
From this moment on,

64
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:30,998
Ro-hee isn't a subject
of an experiment anymore.

65
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,046
How idealistic.

66
00:05:37,755 --> 00:05:38,756
Goodness.

67
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:43,343
Do you know how much Dr. Choi Jin-tae
received for this experiment?

68
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,513
How much money do you think
has been invested until now?

69
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,390
I told you, didn't I?

70
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,323
That money is the most violent and harsh.

71
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,230
You think getting rid of me
will be the end of this?

72
00:05:58,192 --> 00:05:59,192
Yes!

73
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:00,861
I'm going to end this.

74
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:05,616
Ro-hee will live
as an ordinary 11-year-old girl.

75
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:09,870
That's the only thing I can do
as her kidnapper.

76
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:13,957
You...

77
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:16,585
What was it?

78
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:18,169
JJ.

79
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,006
What was his name?

80
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:23,467
Jaden.

81
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,010
Right, Jaden.

82
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,765
If you mess with Ro-hee again like this,

83
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,517
then...

84
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,521
I'll make sure

85
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,982
that you can't move again.

86
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:42,903
Got it, you bastard?

87
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:56,959
Let's not make things complicated.

88
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,294
- Gosh, you talk too much.
- If you...

89
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,424
- Wait.
- What is it?

90
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:05,968
You just need to press this.

91
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:15,185
There's a villa we can go to nearby.

92
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:18,230
It's run by an old couple,
so it'll be safe. Let's head there.

93
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,481
Okay.

94
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,483
- Ro-hee, get in.
- Okay.

95
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:23,434
Is this the right thing to do?

96
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,322
To publicize everything.

97
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,703
Starting tomorrow,
I won't be by Ro-hee's side.

98
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:37,291
Ro-hee's safety is my priority.

99
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,419
Things might get more dangerous
for Ro-hee.

100
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:43,130
She'll draw the world's attention,

101
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,549
and those who invested
in this experiment through Jaden

102
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,384
may cause harm to Ro-hee.

103
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:51,972
Bad things may happen,
and things may not go as planned.

104
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:54,725
But the Ro-hee I know

105
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:58,312
will stay strong in any situation.

106
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,148
She can't live like this forever.

107
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,858
I just have to trust her.

108
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:06,778
And you and Attorney Choi.

CHAPTER 8. THE FIRST CHILD

110
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,468
BASED ON THE NOVEL
<i>THE DAY OF KIDNAPPING</i> BY JEONG HAE-YEON

111
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:58,538
Name.

112
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,088
Not even going to say your name?

113
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,676
We've met before, twice at that.

114
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,681
A cop caught you at the scene,

115
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:17,432
kidnapping a victim of a kidnapping,

116
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:20,644
and hiding away
a kidnapper who was arrested.

117
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:25,065
An attorney won't be enough for you.

118
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,192
You'd probably need divine intervention.

119
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,824
Damn it.

120
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,954
Those bastards won't talk either,
and they have nothing on them.

121
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,181
I've looked into the evidence.

122
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:43,000
The first stack is cash,
and the rest are pieces of paper.

123
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,377
What game are you playing?

124
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,921
You negotiated a ransom for a dead kid.

125
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,506
What do you mean, dead?

126
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:52,676
Right, I'm sorry.

127
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,764
I guess you learned what
pleading the Fifth is from the movies,

128
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,465
but you guys can't leave
since we caught you red-handed.

129
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,060
Staying silent won't change anything

Hello, this is Park Sang-yun.

135
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,554
This is Kim Myeong-jun.

136
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:38,804
You...

137
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:42,017
Where are you right now?
What are you doing?

138
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,977
I called you to ask you a favor.

139
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,498
I don't think you're in the position
to ask for favors.

140
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:48,565
Where's Choi Ro-hee?

141
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,984
She's alive and well. Don't worry.

142
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:52,527
Well...

143
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:54,696
I called you...

144
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,450
because I need your help.

145
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,163
Go ahead.

146
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:04,998
A negotiation...

147
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,001
will be made for Ro-hee today.

148
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:09,878
<i>Ro-hee...</i>

149
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,255
<i>will negotiate with her family.</i>

150
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,549
What are you talking about?

151
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,009
Why would she do that?

152
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:19,513
<i>Those who are paying the ransom for Ro-hee</i>

153
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,766
<i>want to make the public believe
that Ro-hee is dead.</i>

154
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:26,144
And they're the ones
who locked me and Ro-hee up.

155
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,563
Please arrest them.

156
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:32,275
<i>Then I'll get Ro-hee out of here safely.</i>

157
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:33,902
But one thing.

158
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:37,239
You have to do this alone.

159
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:42,077
Why?

160
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:47,290
I think there's a mole in the force.

161
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:51,294
How can I believe you?

162
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,674
You know my daughter, Hee-ae, right?

163
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,885
Tomorrow is her surgery.

164
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,098
I'm thinking of turning myself in

165
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,183
after I see her get out of surgery.

166
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:06,560
I'll go to the hospital.

167
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,521
But before that...

168
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,357
<i>I need to take Ro-hee to a safe place.</i>

169
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:15,861
I'll turn myself in...

170
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,780
after that.

171
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,200
Tell me...

172
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:25,579
what your favor is.

173
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:38,967

Good morning, Dr. Mo.

If you set me free,
only a few people would die.

184
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,212
If you don't, then we might all die.

185
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:00,549
If you leave, I'll set you free.

186
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:03,885
Or else, you'll die.

187
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,120
Criticize me all you want.

188
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,379
But this is a choice for everyone.

189
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:44,009
The most important thing is to prevent
Dr. Choi's research from being publicized.

190
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,930
You don't want Ro-hee to be
everyone's spectacle, do you?

191
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:53,518
Come on, why would I criticize you?

192
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:56,062
I'm also a parent.

193
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:02,235
By the way, what's her name?

194
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,279
Your daughter's name.

195
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:10,493
Byeol.

196
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,495
I see.

197
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:14,706
Byeol.

198
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,292
It's pretty.

199
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:21,171
My daughter's name is Kim Hee-ae,

200
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,090
like the actress.

201
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,808
I saw Byeol last time,
and she's very pretty.

202
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:36,978
Byeol is lucky

203
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:39,064
to have a mom who's a doctor.

204
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:41,816
She must be proud.

205
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,241
Hee-ae was a late talker.

206
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:54,079
Everyone in her preschool started talking,

207
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,332
but Hee-ae couldn't.

208
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:01,920
Gosh, I was so anxious back then.

209
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,255
In hindsight,

210
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:07,050
those worries were pointless.

211
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:10,804
Are you trying to teach me?

212
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:12,597
No.

213
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:15,432
Not at all.

214
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,477
I'm just envious.

215
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,689
Hee-ae...

216
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,817
loved playing.

217
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,487
She never read books
and always watched TV.

218
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,324
And when she went to the playground,
she wouldn't come back home.

219
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:36,663
But now,

220
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,582
I wouldn't care if she watched TV all day

221
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,504
and ran around the playground for days.

222
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:47,632
I just...

223
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,552
want her to get back on her feet.

224
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:04,941
You should go.

225
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:10,029
I'll take Jackson.

226
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:35,263
<i>I'm sorry to say this.</i>

227
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,140
Ms. Mo.

228
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:41,060
I think it'd be wise for you to send Byeol
to a normal kindergarten.

229
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,398
Why? What concerns you?

230
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:48,359
Byeol was a healthy and bright child.

231
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,696
But it seems like
she's getting weaker these days.

232
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:55,575
Could you please take extra care of her?

233
00:17:58,703 --> 00:17:59,788
<i>All our classes</i>

234
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,624
<i>are taught in English.</i>

235
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,125
<i>But Byeol has trouble keeping up.</i>

236
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,878
<i>She says she hates speaking English.</i>

237
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,340
<i>She lost interest
because she can't understand it,</i>

238
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:13,551
<i>so it's harder for her
to hang out with her friends.</i>

239
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:19,474
I'll pay you extra.

240
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,226
Please.

241
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,608
Honestly speaking,

242
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:32,070
Byeol is slower than other kids.

243
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:37,784
<i>The results show that she has
low cognitive abilities and hyperactivity.</i>

244
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:41,162
<i>If you're worried, come to our facility.</i>

245
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,334
<i>She'll get better if she keeps drawing
and hanging out with the kids here.</i>

246
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:48,837
All right.

247
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,463
I'll see you soon.

248
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:58,555
Byeol.

249
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,403
Byeol.

250
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,249
Hey, Park Sang-yun!

251
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,959
Where were you all night?

252
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,891
What's with those guys who are locked up?

253
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,714
I caught them red-handed
negotiating for Choi Ro-hee.

254
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:15,797
What?

255
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:17,133
Choi Ro-hee is alive.

256
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,052
Are those guys the kidnappers?

257
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,554
I'll have to dig into it.
The warrant will be issued soon.

258
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,269
Don't leave anything behind
and take everything!

259
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:26,948
- What are you doing?
- Take the pictures!

260
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:28,937
- This is another case!
- Back up!

261
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,314
This is another case!

262
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,316
- You can't take this!
- Back off!

263
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:35,151
What are you doing?!

264
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,489
Sang-yun.

265
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:42,700
What's going on?

266
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:44,619
We're here to take over
the kidnapping case.

267
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:50,083
Come on, you should've
given us a call beforehand.

268
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,585
We're taking care of that case.

269
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,963
We arrested the prime suspects last night.

270
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:56,673
News travels slowly around here.

271
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:58,549
The warrant was rejected.

272
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,468
- What?
- Take everything!

273
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,345
- Yes, sir.
- Hey, don't move.

274
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,101
This is an obstruction of justice.

275
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:11,312
We're both civil servants,
and you're also obstructing justice.

276
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,024
You people here
really don't care about ranks, do you?

277
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:15,942
What did you say?

278
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,277
Hey! What's your rank, you bastard?

279
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:19,904
- You rude bastard!
- Seriously.

280
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,757
This is an order
from the commissioner general!

281
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,866
Have some manners
if you're visiting another station!

282
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:25,072
I ask for your cooperation.

283
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:26,369
- Take everything!
- Hey!

284
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:27,537
Stop them!

285
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,081
- Hey!
- Stop, you bastard!

286
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,499
- Damn it!
- You bastards!

287
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:32,792
Everyone, stop!

288
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,587
The first thing you do at work is fight?

289
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:44,176
It hasn't even been 12 hours
since I arrested them.

290
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:48,141
How can the warrant be rejected
when they had the ransom?

291
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,935
When an order comes down,
you have to follow it.

292
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:54,313
You guys are a bunch of troublemakers.

293
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,232
Who gave this order?

294
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:57,692
Are you interrogating me?

295
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,260
This isn't the first time
things have been unfair and dirty.

296
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,321
Why can't you let go of this?

297
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:04,633
Choi Ro-hee, who was apparently
thrown into the sea, is alive.

298
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,537
And we caught them
with the ransom on the scene.

299
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,704
So how can you let them go right away?

300
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,581
Who says Choi Ro-hee is alive?

301
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,500
Who says that money
was Choi Ro-hee's ransom?

302
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:18,880
Who gave you the tip?

303
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:22,216
Kim Myeong-jun.

304
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:23,926
What?

305
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,054
What about his number? Did you track it?

306
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:27,638
He's going to turn himself in.

307
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:31,017
Today is Kim Myeong-jun's
daughter's surgery.

308
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:33,196
He's going to the hospital
with Choi Ro-hee.

309
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:36,773
Damn it. Why would you tell us that now?

310
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:39,067
The murder and the kidnapping case

311
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:41,319
can be both concluded at once.

312
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:47,241
How do you trust him
to turn himself in with Choi Ro-hee?

313
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:49,285
And also,

314
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:52,663
how do you trust the statement
that Dr. Choi and his father

315
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:54,123
conducted experiments on children?

316
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:55,541
A victim testified.

317
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:56,959
How do you trust that victim?

318
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,836
They are all circumstantial!

319
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:01,881
And that victim has a close relationship
with the murderer,

320
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:04,342
and she's also the kidnapper's wife.

321
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:07,804
Sir, I'll make sure to bring...

322
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:10,723
Kim Myeong-jun and Choi Ro-hee in today.

323
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:12,517
Please trust me this once.

324
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:16,813
Why can't you civil servants
just follow orders?

325
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:19,816
You two better be ready
to give me your badges

326
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,692
if you do something I can't cover.

327
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:23,986
I need solid evidence.

328
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:26,364
If you talk without solid evidence,

329
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,449
I can't protect you two.

330
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:31,869
You still up for this?

331
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:34,330
Yes, sir.

332
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:53,683
- Hello?
<i>- It's me.</i>

333
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:55,893
<i>Where are you?</i>

334
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,312
On my way to Seoul.

335
00:23:58,396 --> 00:23:59,397
Are you done?

336
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,991
I have some questions
and things I want to confirm.

337
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:13,119
But Hee-ae's surgery comes first,
so come to the hospital.

338
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:14,787
<i>I'll be there.</i>

339
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:21,919
Don't tell me you forgot
it was her surgery today.

340
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,840
I didn't forget.
I was getting ready to go.

341
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,260
But there will be cops at the hospital.

342
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:30,427
I know.

343
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:32,513
I'm on my way to turn myself in.

344
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:33,847
<i>What about Ro-hee?</i>

345
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,017
She's coming with me.

346
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,311
I have until today.

347
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,439
I'll end everything today.

348
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,443
Make sure you come.

349
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:47,278
If you don't,

350
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:49,989
I won't let it slide.

351
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,129
What?

352
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:10,843
This is what we get
for working so hard last night?

353
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:14,680
What can we do?
It's an order from the higher-ups.

354
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:18,476
What on earth is going on?

355
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,978
Where's Detective Park?

356
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:23,314
He's downstairs.

357
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:27,276
Let's go.

358
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:30,862
Hey.

359
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:35,618
You really had divine intervention.

360
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,396
You must think the world is a joke

361
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:41,290
since you're protected
despite all your illegal activities.

362
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:51,634
I'll see you again.

363
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,757
And I'll make sure
to wipe that smile off your face.

364
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,138
That damn bastard.

365
00:25:56,681 --> 00:25:58,724
I don't like the look in your eyes.

366
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:04,021
Should we go after them?

367
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:05,398
Kim Myeong-jun comes first.

368
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:08,442
- Let's get ready.
- But sir.

369
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:11,279
About last night and this situation,

370
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:14,490
why won't you tell us
who's tipping you off?

371
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,783
Do you not trust us?

372
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,869
I don't even trust myself.

373
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:20,788
Get ready.

374
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:24,165
Yes, sir.

375
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,384
You must be nervous.

376
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:34,635
Sorry?

377
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:35,720
Right.

378
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,430
The surgery will go well.

379
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:39,223
Don't worry.

380
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:40,850
Thank you.

381
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,270
Are you going to go wearing that?

382
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:45,896
What?

383
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,940
You're going to the hospital
to see your daughter.

384
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,525
Are you going to dress like that?

385
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:54,613
I can't tell
if you're wearing clothes or a rag.

386
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:56,782
What's wrong with this?

387
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,162
The smell? It's fine.

388
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:04,999
Attorney Choi,
let's go get some clothes for him.

389
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:07,877
Okay.

390
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:25,144
- I'll bring a size bigger.
- Okay.

391
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:30,815
How do I look?

392
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:35,821
Well, it's better
than that rag you were wearing.

393
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:39,158
I've never worn a suit in front of her.

394
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,553
What if she doesn't recognize me
because I look too cool?

395
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:43,662
You don't look that great, so don't worry.

396
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,165
Right?

397
00:27:57,885 --> 00:27:58,886
You guessed it.

398
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:00,846
He's my kidnapper,

399
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:03,099
and I'm the victim.

400
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:04,975
Sorry?

401
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:06,142
Hey!

402
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:07,728
I'm on my way to turn myself in.

403
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:09,397
- No need to be scared.
- Sorry?

404
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:12,108
Wait...

405
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:13,984
Are you okay?

406
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:16,821
Gosh, she must be shocked!

407
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:19,532
Goodness, take a deep breath.

408
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:25,329
- You don't seem okay. Look at me.
- What?

409
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:26,997
Oh no, you look even more pale.

410
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:28,290
Take a deep breath.

411
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:34,839
ES HOSPITAL

412
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:36,382
During the rounding, make sure to...

413
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,675
Hello, Dr. Mo.

414
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:42,322
I'm sorry for being absent so often
when things are busy these days.

415
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:43,639
Not at all.

416
00:28:43,848 --> 00:28:45,975
Right, you have a guest in your office.

417
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:48,643
A guest?

418
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:50,312
You'll be happy to see them.

419
00:28:57,278 --> 00:28:58,404
Mom!

420
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:01,907
How did you...

421
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,541
Where are they?

422
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,918
We parted ways this morning.

423
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:21,385
Call him.

424
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:31,896
You're eating so well.

425
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,898
There's shrimp, so take it out, okay?

426
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:36,984
Ro-hee likes Chinese food.

427
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:38,652
I see.

428
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:42,907
It's not that I like Chinese food.
I like the food here.

429
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,993
This is the first time eating here, right?

430
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,206
I'd take the food to-go at times
when I taught her

431
00:29:50,498 --> 00:29:52,018
since Ro-hee couldn't leave the house.

432
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:53,833
I see.

433
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:55,961
It's really good.

434
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:00,674
Gosh, you have a sophisticated palate too.

435
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:04,887
You should eat. You must be hungry.

436
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,222
I will. Thank you.

437
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,600
DR. MO EUN-SUN

438
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,603
Yes, Dr. Mo.

439
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:15,897
Us?

440
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:18,234
Not yet. We're still eating.

441
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:20,736
This place?

442
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,404
CHEONGDAM-DONG SACHEONGUNG

443
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,155
<i>Are you coming?</i>

444
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:27,117
No, well...

445
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:30,704
I wanted to ask one more time

446
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:32,790
if you can let Jaden go.

447
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:35,876
<i>That's not something for me to decide.</i>

448
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:37,920
Okay.

449
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:10,786
I guess she's still torn about Jaden.

450
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:15,916
After all, people move solely
for their own goals.

451
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,128
Anyway, can you defend us in court?

452
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,630
That's my job.

453
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,549
Not for me, but for him.

454
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:27,468
Me?

455
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:29,930
The victim's attorney

456
00:31:30,014 --> 00:31:32,850
can't defend the perpetrator.

457
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:35,227
Get him the best attorney you can find.

458
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:37,062
I can pay however much they want.

459
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,571
By the way,

460
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:49,366
why is this restaurant so empty?

461
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,451
It's weird.

462
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:53,787
We rented the whole restaurant.

463
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:55,497
The whole place?

464
00:31:56,624 --> 00:31:57,750
Don't be surprised.

465
00:31:58,167 --> 00:31:59,501
Ro-hee paid for it.

466
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:02,755
Just how rich are you?

467
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,088
Can you calculate it?

468
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:05,215
Somewhat.

469
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:09,136
As for real estate,
there's Dr. Choi's house.

470
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:12,473
Then there are his hospital shares,
bonds, foreign bonds,

471
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:13,974
market shares, and savings.

472
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:15,996
It adds up to around 120 billion won.

473
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:17,602
What?

474
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:19,555
Did you say 120 billion won?!

475
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:23,567
By the way,

476
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:27,154
how much were you going to ask
as my ransom?

477
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:29,948
Fifty million won.

478
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:32,826
That's a blow to my pride.

479
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:35,871
All I needed was the money
for Hee-ae's surgery.

480
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:39,166
Ro-hee, do you want
to take a look at this?

481
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,500
What is it?

482
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:45,589
I'm going through Dr. Choi's emails,

483
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:48,008
and he created a wallet

484
00:32:48,092 --> 00:32:50,094
in a cryptocurrency exchange in Singapore.

485
00:32:50,678 --> 00:32:52,554
It doesn't say how much.

486
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:56,308
But the date he created the wallet
coincides with when he met Jaden.

487
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:58,227
Jaden said yesterday

488
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:01,188
that they won't sit around
since my dad received a lot of money.

489
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:03,732
Among his financial assets,
the biggest investments

490
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:05,901
were the 10 billion won
from the Korean investors.

491
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:10,489
So this is where his foreign money
came through.

492
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:11,949
Look into it.

493
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:13,366
Okay.

494
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:19,123
Aren't we too focused on money
when your dad died?

495
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:21,250
You won't be with me anymore,

496
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,461
so the only thing
that can protect me is money.

497
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:36,390
The last time you brought food
from this place...

498
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,143
was the day before the incident.

499
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,939
No wonder I refused to eat
that unpleasant white thing you made.

500
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,484
My body refused it on its own
since I had luxurious food just before.

501
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:51,405
All right. Just keep eating.

502
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:52,740
Ro-hee, hold on.

503
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:56,201
According to your mom's
credit card records,

504
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:58,245
she came here on May 19th.

505
00:33:58,579 --> 00:33:59,579
What?

506
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,330
Really?

507
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,001
It can't be.

508
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:06,712
The day before is the 20th.

509
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,925
Are you sure you kidnapped me on the 21st?

510
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:13,552
Of course.

511
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:15,345
How could I forget?

512
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:21,393
Choi Ro-hee witnessed the incident.

513
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:23,562
We only have
Park Cheol-won's statement for now,

514
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:26,273
but we'll have more information
when we compare his with Ro-hee's.

515
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,358
What time is the surgery again?

516
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:30,027
He's coming for sure, right?

517
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,236
Don't worry.

518
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,739
All right. Listen carefully.

519
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:36,950
I'm on the verge of getting fired here.

520
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:40,204
You think it's enough with you four?
You want me to request backup?

521
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:42,748
It's fine.
Kim Myeong-jun won't cause a scene.

522
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,626
We'll quietly bring him here
after her surgery.

523
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:46,834
Okay.

524
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:48,128
Let's do it!

525
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:49,375
- We'll be back.
- Yes, sir.

526
00:34:50,214 --> 00:34:51,298
All right.

527
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:53,801
- We'll get going.
- Okay.

528
00:34:58,305 --> 00:34:59,305
Go on.

529
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:53,026
I assumed that things went awry
since you didn't call.

530
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:55,404
I knew you'd get yourself out of it.

531
00:35:57,114 --> 00:35:58,574
Did the boss pull some strings?

532
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:02,578
Gosh, he's one amazing stud.

533
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,413
Hey.

534
00:37:45,973 --> 00:37:47,349
We're going to the operating unit.

535
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:52,813
Hee-ae is going to the operating unit.

536
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:54,982
Kim Myeong-jun isn't here yet.

537
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,153
Over there.

538
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:01,947
Can I go buy that teddy bear?

539
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,533
I won't be seeing for a while after today,

540
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,016
so I don't want to go empty-handed.

541
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:07,619
Sure, I'll go get the car.

542
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:09,121
I'll wait outside then.

543
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:10,205
Okay.

544
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,041
You want one too?

545
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:14,876
I don't need one.

546
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,960
Hurry back.

547
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,337
Okay.

548
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:22,884
- I'll take that one.
- Okay.

549
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,637
Thank you.

550
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,522
- Attorney Choi.
- Yes?

551
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:38,275
I can't seem to remember
what happened on the 20th.

552
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:39,860
Why is that?

553
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:45,073
How can I not remember that one day?

554
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,035
Maybe it's because
your memories aren't fully back yet.

555
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,415
It doesn't add up

556
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:57,586
because I clearly remember the 19th,
which is when I had Chinese food.

557
00:38:58,045 --> 00:39:01,506
And the 21st,
which is when I got kidnapped.

558
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,143
What's wrong?

559
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:15,145
Are you okay?

560
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,354
What's wrong?

561
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:22,235
I'm fine.

562
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:25,697
I won't pass out.

563
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,169
No!

564
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:41,295
Attorney Choi.

565
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:46,176
Attorney Choi...

566
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:56,143
Attorney Choi!

567
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:07,322
Attorney Choi.

568
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,448
Attorney Choi!

569
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,158
Kim Myeong-jun!

570
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:12,244
Kim Myeong-jun! Hurry up!

571
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:14,121
Attorney Choi!

572
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:15,914
Kim Myeong-jun!

573
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:17,331
Kim Myeong...

574
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:28,051
Attorney Choi!

575
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:30,512
Ro-hee!

576
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,097
Goodness.

577
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:34,808
Attorney Choi!

578
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:37,894
My goodness.

579
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:39,396
Phone.

580
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:47,154
A man was stabbed!

581
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:49,364
This is the parking lot of Sacheongung!

582
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:51,283
It's Cheongdam-dong! Yes!

583
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:52,617
Please hurry!

584
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:54,119
Thank you.

585
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,121
Hold on.

586
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:58,248
Where's Ro-hee?

587
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:00,750
Hang on.

588
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:01,835
Ro-hee.

589
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:03,085
Ro-hee!

590
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:04,921
Ro-hee!

591
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:13,513
Damn it.

592
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:24,191
- The entrance?
- <i>Not yet.</i>

593
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,164
Excuse me. Is the surgery starting?

594
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,583
- What about her guardian?
- She's here.

595
00:41:51,218 --> 00:41:54,679
I told you getting rid of me
won't end this.

596
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,264
Leave Ro-hee here!

597
00:41:58,558 --> 00:41:59,768
You should go first.

598
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:02,020
I'll send her to you
when she becomes useless.

599
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:06,858
Let me ask you a question.

600
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:09,736
What is Choi Ro-hee to you?

601
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,239
Why are you throwing yourself
to protect her?

602
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:13,698
Is it for money?

603
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:16,493
We can give you that too, you know?

604
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:19,996
You should act smart.

605
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:28,713
You bastard!

606
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,094
I told you

607
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,459
I'd make sure that you can't move
if you touch her again.

608
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:45,522
Where is she?

609
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,112
You bastard.

610
00:43:21,725 --> 00:43:22,725
Ro-hee.

611
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:25,061
You can't take Ro-hee.

612
00:43:25,145 --> 00:43:26,145
Ro-hee.

613
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:31,609
Ro-hee!

614
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:33,236
Ro-hee!

615
00:43:34,404 --> 00:43:35,404
Ro-hee!

616
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:40,327
Ro-hee!

617
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,260
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

618
00:43:59,054 --> 00:44:00,221
Any news on the first floor?

619
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:04,601
Nothing here.

620
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:06,269
Is he not coming?

621
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:09,981
<i>Ju-hyeok, have you seen him?</i>

622
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:11,608
Not yet, sir.

623
00:44:14,027 --> 00:44:15,904
- Are you Hee-ae's guardian?
- Yes.

624
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:17,822
The surgery went well.

625
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:19,949
Thank you.

626
00:44:20,033 --> 00:44:21,576
Let's keep an eye on her recovery.

627
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,286
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

628
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:39,844
I'm glad it went well.

629
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,763
Thank you.

630
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,768
Did Mr. Kim Myeong-jun call by any chance?

631
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:49,562
This afternoon.

632
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,440
He said he'd come to the hospital.

633
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:54,067
Has he called you since then?

634
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:03,493
Did he call you on a public phone?

635
00:45:04,536 --> 00:45:06,871
No, it was a cell phone.

636
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:12,752
- Here.
- Okay.

637
00:45:16,131 --> 00:45:17,132
Thank you.

638
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:20,135
Hello, this is Park Sang-yun from...

639
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:23,680
Where is he?

640
00:45:24,556 --> 00:45:25,556
A hospital?

641
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,564
I'm the detective who called earlier.

642
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:34,023
Right, this way.

643
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:48,355
He was bleeding heavily
due to a stab wound in the abdomen.

644
00:45:48,538 --> 00:45:49,914
He's stable now.

645
00:45:50,707 --> 00:45:51,708
I see.

646
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:09,601
- Hey.
- It happened here, all right.

647
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:12,061
He broke the CCTV as well.

648
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,980
<i>The CCTV? Who?</i>

649
00:46:14,314 --> 00:46:17,108
That bastard we let go this morning.

650
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:25,867
- Where's Kim Myeong-jun?
- He disappeared.

651
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:27,534
Damn it.

652
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:30,246
He's damn tough, isn't he?

653
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:31,414
What should we do with her?

654
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:34,125
Just leave her be.

655
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,503
We'll take her to Russia like this.

656
00:46:54,521 --> 00:46:59,234
VIOLENT CRIMES TEAM 1

657
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,319
The disciplinary meeting
will be held tomorrow.

658
00:47:02,904 --> 00:47:04,155
Go home and rest.

659
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:15,333
Go home.

660
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:16,668
Good work today, everyone.

661
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:18,795
Where are you going?

662
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:25,718
Home.

663
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:46,906
<i>The door has opened.</i>

664
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:36,331
Look at you.

665
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:39,459
What happened?

666
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:44,380
What about Hee-ae?

667
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:46,758
The surgery went well.

668
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:51,220
Why are you alone?

669
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:53,097
What about Ro-hee?

670
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:57,352
I lost her.

671
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:58,811
What?

672
00:48:58,895 --> 00:49:00,480
Where? How?

673
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:01,730
Don't worry.

674
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:03,858
I'll find her again.

675
00:49:11,366 --> 00:49:13,701
I thought everything would be over today.

676
00:49:15,912 --> 00:49:16,912
I thought...

677
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:19,809
Ro-hee would go back to where she was,

678
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:23,670
and I would see...

679
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,256
Hee-ae go into the operating unit.

680
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:33,137
I didn't care...

681
00:49:34,514 --> 00:49:36,099
what happened to me

682
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:38,768
if I could make that happen.

683
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:43,815
Damn it.

684
00:49:49,404 --> 00:49:50,947
I want to die.

685
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:52,865
Why would you die?

686
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:55,535
You have Hee-ae.

687
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:01,082
Hee-ae's in the recovery room,

688
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:03,918
so let's go to the hospital tomorrow
and see her.

689
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:06,295
Then go to the police station after.

690
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:09,215
The best thing to do for Hee-ae
is for you to turn yourself in

691
00:50:09,841 --> 00:50:11,467
and end everything.

692
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,010
What's your relationship...

693
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:20,518
with Ro-hee's dad's murderer?

694
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:24,688
He's the one...

695
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:28,735
who gave me the scar on my neck.

696
00:50:28,985 --> 00:50:29,986
What?

697
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:33,406
Don't tell me...

698
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:36,784
What?

699
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:38,661
What are you getting at?

700
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:40,788
I didn't.

701
00:50:42,165 --> 00:50:44,167
I may have told you to kidnap Ro-hee,

702
00:50:44,584 --> 00:50:46,669
but I never told someone to commit murder.

703
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:48,838
So don't worry.

704
00:50:57,597 --> 00:50:59,891
You should rest for now.

705
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:04,562
Let's go see Hee-ae

706
00:51:05,354 --> 00:51:06,731
first thing tomorrow.

707
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:09,525
After I find Ro-hee.

708
00:51:09,609 --> 00:51:10,943
Turn yourself in first!

709
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:17,742
Until when are you going
to neglect Hee-ae?

710
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,347
<i>No, Dr. Choi.</i>

711
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:41,450
<i>You've never stabbed someone before,
have you?</i>

712
00:51:41,474 --> 00:51:42,954
<i>- Stab me. I'll stand still.
- No, sir.</i>

713
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:45,812
<i>Go ahead, Mr. Park.</i>

714
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,481
<i>Stab me, you bastard...</i>

715
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:06,249
<i>There was no money.
I only found strange documents.</i>

716
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:15,465
<i>Documents?</i>

717
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:17,760
I heard there were documents in the safe.

718
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:19,387
But I don't see them.

719
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:20,720
<i>What documents?</i>

720
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:22,199
Mr. Park Cheol-won broke into the house

721
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:24,350
and only found documents
when he opened the safe.

722
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:26,394
So he turned back and left the room.

723
00:52:26,936 --> 00:52:29,313
I was wondering if you kept them.

724
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,649
<i>No, we didn't find any documents.</i>

725
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:36,279
<i>If there was something in the safe,
I'm sure we would've kept it.</i>

726
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,531
Right?

727
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:44,412
Thank you.

728
00:53:54,607 --> 00:53:58,486
CHOI RO-HEE RECORD

729
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:24,928
Hey.

730
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:27,431
What brings you here at this hour?

731
00:54:31,644 --> 00:54:33,229
We overlooked something at the scene.

732
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:35,856
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

733
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:37,441
Goodness.

734
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:42,029
This is why I hate working
with sleepless people.

735
00:54:45,241 --> 00:54:46,784
- There are more here.
- Okay.

736
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:51,684
When will I look through all of them?

737
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:53,040
How much time do I have?

738
00:54:53,874 --> 00:54:56,252
There isn't much time.
The disciplinary meeting is tomorrow.

739
00:54:58,087 --> 00:55:00,381
Is this your last dance
before you turn in your badge?

740
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:02,341
Is there anything I can help you with?

741
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:03,634
Can you read these?

742
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,847
- I'll go get coffee.
- Plus two energy drinks.

743
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:09,055
Yes, ma'am.

744
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:48,804
COME TO THE HOSPITAL!

745
00:56:51,367 --> 00:56:52,409
Hey!

746
00:56:53,369 --> 00:56:54,495
It must be nice.

747
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:57,665
Look at you sleeping like a baby
when you're about to turn your badge in.

748
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,292
I'm sorry.

749
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,044
Did you find anything?

750
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:03,337
Yes.

751
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:06,715
These are records that were written
since Dr. Choi Dong-eok's time.

752
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:09,176
Just as Seo Hye-eun said in her statement,

753
00:57:09,301 --> 00:57:11,011
he tried to artificially amplify

754
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:13,472
brain functions using medical technology.

755
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:17,143
Most children were research subjects,
not experimental subjects.

756
00:57:17,226 --> 00:57:19,603
Only two children
were the subjects of his experiment.

757
00:57:19,979 --> 00:57:21,188
What's the difference?

758
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:23,232
Well...

759
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:26,527
Although MRI scans were already being used
in the United Kingdom since the 1970s,

760
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:30,322
we officially started using them
in Korea in 1988.

761
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:34,451
He used them in his personal research.

762
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:36,912
His methodology was simple.

763
00:57:37,246 --> 00:57:40,166
He matched the children's IQ

764
00:57:40,249 --> 00:57:43,335
and the result
of that children's MRI scan.

765
00:57:43,836 --> 00:57:47,464
But as for experimental subjects,
it's quite cruel.

766
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:49,341
He injected...

767
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:53,470
genetically modified viruses
into the subject's brain to stimulate it.

768
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:56,223
I think he tried to expand
the hippocampus,

769
00:57:56,307 --> 00:57:58,142
which plays a major role in memory.

770
00:57:58,517 --> 00:58:00,519
It's risky,
thus it was called an experiment.

771
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:06,442
I think that's why he faked an adoption
to run experiments on Seo Hye-eun.

772
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:08,944
Then did Choi Jin-tae
undergo the same experiment?

773
00:58:09,028 --> 00:58:11,697
No. Choi Jin-tae
has always been intelligent.

774
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:13,531
Here.

775
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,660
Look. His IQ was 152.

776
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:18,662
Many were against

777
00:58:18,746 --> 00:58:21,582
Dr. Choi Dong-eok's experiment
in the academic community.

778
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:23,334
They wanted to stop him at all costs.

779
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:26,879
So he had no choice
but to stop the experiment.

780
00:58:27,463 --> 00:58:28,589
As a result,

781
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:31,800
I think he tried to find his successor

782
00:58:31,884 --> 00:58:34,136
by adopting a bright child from the start.

783
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:36,013
Let's see.

784
00:58:36,597 --> 00:58:39,475
This is the research record
that Choi Jin-tae wrote.

785
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:42,478
But his records stop

786
00:58:42,561 --> 00:58:44,438
when Ro-hee becomes two years old.

787
00:58:45,314 --> 00:58:47,149
- Why?
- I don't know.

788
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:50,861
I think he kept the records
in another place.

789
00:58:52,947 --> 00:58:54,240
Where could he have kept it?

790
00:58:56,825 --> 00:58:58,369
The kidnapping and the murder

791
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,206
may all be happening
to take control of this experiment.

792
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:03,499
Probably.

793
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:05,960
By the way,

794
00:59:06,335 --> 00:59:08,837
they demanded 30 billion won
for Choi Ro-hee?

795
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:10,506
That's surprisingly little.

796
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:17,263
Last night,
I lost the kid and the kidnapper.

797
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:19,532
The kidnapper,
who was clueless about all this,

798
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,183
got involved in a big fight.

799
00:59:21,267 --> 00:59:23,477
The kidnapper. I told you, right?

800
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:26,438
Only two children
were experimental subjects.

801
00:59:26,939 --> 00:59:27,939
Yes.

802
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:30,943
The candidate of the experimental subject
before Seo Hye-eun.

803
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:33,529
The first child.

804
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:40,244
Kim Myeong-jun from Hope Orphanage.

805
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:50,045

Choi Jin-tae?

808
01:01:00,616 --> 01:01:02,677
<i>The kid who was a candidate
of the experimental subject grew up</i>

809
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:05,204
<i>and kidnapped
the complete product of the experiment.</i>

810
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:07,998
<i>Are you saying
Kim Myeong-jun intentionally kidnapped</i>

811
01:01:08,082 --> 01:01:09,541
and murdered Choi Ro-hee?

812
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:11,960
<i>If you turn yourself in
and be cooperative,</i>

813
01:01:12,086 --> 01:01:14,046
<i>the cops will find Ro-hee.</i>

814
01:01:14,129 --> 01:01:15,214
<i>Why did you come here?</i>

815
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:17,883
I have to find Ro-hee,
but I have nowhere to go.

816
01:01:17,966 --> 01:01:20,386
<i>When people find out Ro-hee is a genius,</i>

817
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:22,429
<i>she'll become an animal in the zoo.</i>

818
01:01:22,638 --> 01:01:26,266

<i>Where's Park Sang-yun?</i>

821
01:01:29,812 --> 01:01:33,273
<i>If grown-ups' twisted desires
are what's making Ro-hee suffer,</i>

822
01:01:33,399 --> 01:01:34,399
I should save her.

823
01:01:34,483 --> 01:01:35,818
<i>Why are you going so far?</i>

824
01:01:36,151 --> 01:01:37,611
<i>I need to keep my promise.</i>

825
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:39,905
Where are you, Mr. Kim?
