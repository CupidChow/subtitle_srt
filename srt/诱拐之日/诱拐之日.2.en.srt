DEVELOPMENT FUND

5
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:22,249
Why is the door open?

6
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,232
What's this stench?

7
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,367
Ma'am.

8
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,161
Gosh, the smell.

9
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:01,622
Sir.

10
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,970
Sir.

11
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:27,690
Why is the heater on so high?

12
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,568
What on earth is this smell?

13
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,962
Goodness, why is this on the floor?

14
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:53,757
My gosh!

15
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:01,390
<i>You have arrived at your destination.</i>

16
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,475
<i>Ending navigation.</i>

17
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:24,747
Goodness.

18
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,958
Did you not go home yesterday again?

19
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,835
I prefer sleeping at the station.

20
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,588
I'm too bothered to commute to work.

21
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:35,674
How is it that you still look clean
like you've been home?

22
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:37,551
Why didn't you go home?

23
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,762
I came from home.

24
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:41,055
What?

25
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:43,140
I got off on time yesterday.

26
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,481
It's going to take a while
to investigate a house this big.

27
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,446
Hello, I'm Kim Ju-hyeok.

28
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:59,156
- Hey, rookie.
- Yes, sir.

29
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,620
Hey, look into the CCTV

30
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,747
that's been torn off there.

31
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:08,082
Sorry?

32
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:11,752
Yes, sir.

33
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:30,980
He's the owner of this house.

34
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:33,107
He's Director Choi Jin-tae
of Hyekwang Hospital.

35
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:36,318
He's a well-known brain specialist.
He was even on TV.

36
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:40,781
The scene has been pretty well preserved.

37
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,659
An uncanny posture, don't you think?

38
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:45,995
But this isn't all.

39
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:48,956
Come over here.

40
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:07,808
This room was heated to expose the body
to high temperatures.

41
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,521
Her whole body is bloated
due to the gas that's been emitted

42
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,189
from the bacterization in her organs.

43
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:17,943
What's piercing her chest?

44
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,069
A paper knife.

45
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,738
A paper knife.

46
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:25,034
It's as if these two deaths
are from two different cases.

47
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:28,620
We're guessing she's Ms. So Jin-yu,
Dr. Choi Jin-tae's wife.

48
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:32,291
Her body was severely decomposed
to the point she was hardly recognizable.

49
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,626
But the witness recognized
the necklace and the bracelet

50
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,128
and realized it was Ms. So.

51
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:38,213
- Where's the witness?
- Outside.

52
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:46,597
Damn it!

53
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,016
What happened?

54
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,142
Damn it.

55
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:52,811
I need to call her.

56
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,691
Pick up.

57
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,737
Why aren't you picking up? Damn it!

58
00:06:13,082 --> 00:06:14,750
It's okay.

59
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,002
I need to calm down.

60
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:18,921
Think.

61
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:21,882
All right.

62
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,218
Damn it!

63
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,029
What?

64
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:43,714
CHAPTER 2. FALSE ACCUSATION

65
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,888
{\an8}- What's going on?
- Why is the police car here?

66
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,223
{\an8}Is there anyone
who may be holding grudges against them?

67
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,896
{\an8}Based on my experience with them,
they're not the type to have enemies.

68
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,440
{\an8}I mean, they were well-off.

69
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:04,693
{\an8}Were there no frequent visitors?

70
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,987
{\an8}Apart from their families,

71
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,573
{\an8}no one else visited them.

72
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:13,285
{\an8}Mr. Choi was always obsessed with work,

73
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:17,331
{\an8}and Ms. So rarely went out.

74
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:21,376
{\an8}Did you find anything strange
other than the fact that

75
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,003
{\an8}the heater in the study was turned up?

76
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:25,672
{\an8}Well...

77
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:29,176
{\an8}Other than the decoration
that was on the floor...

78
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,804
I'm not sure.

79
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:37,100
I was panicking,
so I couldn't look around.

80
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:40,145
One more thing.

81
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:44,441
I saw the family photo in the living room
and it seems like they have a daughter.

82
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,817
Have you not seen her?

83
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:47,194
Ro-hee.

84
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:49,905
Ro-hee's not here!

85
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:45,497
Hey!

86
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,067
Right here.

87
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:27,330
What?

88
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:31,793
What the...

89
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:44,598
Hee-ae.

90
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,645
Hee-ae.

91
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:53,648
Hee-ae!

92
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:57,360
Hee-ae!

93
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:02,574
Ro-hee!

94
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:19,132
Ro-hee!

95
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:25,180
Ro-hee!

96
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:28,225
Damn it.

97
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,569
Ro-hee!

98
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,616
Ro-hee!

99
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:49,996
Ro-hee!

100
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:07,222
This is a room
of an 11-year-old kid, right?

101
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,725
I don't see any children's items.

102
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,811
Tell me about it.

103
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:15,522
Just looking at the shelf gives me chills.

104
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,818
Sir, I looked around,
and there were no signs of a child.

105
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:20,986
But...

106
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:22,237
But what?

107
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,781
There's something strange.

108
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,752
Gosh, what's this?

109
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,590
I thought you only
see things like this in movies.

110
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,553
What's all this?

111
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,097
Did he perform surgeries here?

112
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:50,432
Who knows?

113
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:54,561
It's like a whole hospital in here.

114
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,953
BRAIN RESEARCH WEEK
DIRECTOR CHOI JIN-TAE

115
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,288
Sir.

116
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,792
I called the security company,

117
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,795
and they removed all the CCTVs
four days ago.

118
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:23,298
They removed them?

119
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:24,466
Yes, sir.

120
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,062
Sir.

121
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:39,689
Hey.

122
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,984
Have you seen a girl about this tall?

123
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,028
I'm not sure.

124
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:49,824
Would there be anyone living here
except for you and me?

125
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,409
Well, that's true.

126
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,371
Anyway, thank you.

127
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,081
Good luck searching.

128
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:08,051
Excuse me.

129
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,056
Hey, stop!

130
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,904
Damn it.

131
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:30,490
Who are you?

132
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:33,284
Me?

133
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,872
I'm a guy who collects anything of value.

134
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:50,760
Who the hell are you?!

135
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,013
Ro-hee!

136
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:55,140
You bastard.

137
00:16:58,852 --> 00:16:59,686
Ro-hee!

138
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,354
You just need to bring her.

139
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:45,690
Bring her?

140
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,151
Kidnap her.

141
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,444
Hey!

142
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,617
Are you insane?
What do you mean kidnap her?

143
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,452
This is the only way

144
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,162
to pay for Hee-ae's hospital bill.

145
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,998
This isn't a solution.

146
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,251
You should've brought all the money
you took three years ago.

147
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:06,252
What? Kidnap?

148
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:09,255
Hey, you think that money
would've been enough?

149
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:11,549
I heard you're overdue
for more than ten million won.

150
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:14,219
It's going to cost tens of millions of won
if a donor shows up.

151
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,227
Still, this is wrong.

152
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:23,895
What if things go wrong?

153
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,523
I can't go to jail
and leave Hee-ae behind.

154
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,233
You won't.

155
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,861
Her parents can't call the police
no matter what.

156
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:33,321
Why not?

157
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,533
They have an unbelievable amount of money.

158
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:37,867
They're also well-known,

159
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,161
so they wouldn't want to become
the talk of the town.

160
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,289
You think they'll stand around
when their kid gets kidnapped?

161
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:44,791
Yes, they will.

162
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,168
She's...

163
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,255
being abused.

164
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:51,881
What?

165
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,098
I still can't.

166
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:01,891
I don't want to go that far.

167
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:05,645
You're still...

168
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,439
not desperate, are you?

169
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,987
You dare talk about being desperate?

170
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:16,406
How can you say that to me

171
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,408
when you left your child
to live on your own?

172
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,826
Then what's your plan?

173
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,579
You think love and care
can solve everything?

174
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:24,873
Don't you need money?

175
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:30,420
Myeong-jun.

176
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:33,590
Are you sure...

177
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,175
you can handle

178
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,094
the hospital bill and surgery fee?

179
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:49,105
You said Hee-ae is your priority.

180
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:19,594
<i>Dad.</i>

181
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:22,680
Yes, my daughter.

182
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:24,891
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

183
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:28,311
I'm listening.

184
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:31,689
<i>Come on, open your eyes.</i>

185
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,317
<i>Are you going to sleep here?</i>

186
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,944
<i>Wake up.</i>

187
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:37,236
What?

188
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:39,364
I said wake up.

189
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:47,330
What a relief!

190
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,000
Thank goodness.

191
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,129
Have you lost your mind?

192
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:58,508
This happened
because you left a kid alone!

193
00:20:58,591 --> 00:20:59,467
I'm sorry.

194
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,594
Are you okay? Are you not hurt?

195
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,596
We'll know when we get to the hospital.

196
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:06,265
Where's the ambulance?

197
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,518
Where are the police?

198
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,644
What?

199
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,230
Aren't you going to call them?

200
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:13,147
Right.

201
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:14,941
I should.

202
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:16,651
What's with you?

203
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:18,695
Why are you so calm?

204
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:22,532
Your one and only daughter almost died.

205
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:24,117
By any chance...

206
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:28,913
are you in a situation
where you can't call the police?

207
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:31,207
Are you in hiding

208
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,167
or running away?

209
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:37,755
Let's...

210
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,427
go to the hospital
and the police station tomorrow.

211
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,600
Don't ever...

212
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,062
go anywhere without me again.

213
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:58,484
Okay.

214
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:04,574
As you can see,

215
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,243
the long sword that penetrated
Dr. Choi Jin-tae's abdomen

216
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,661
is a katana he owned.

217
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,413
According to the examination,

218
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,790
the cut on his hand is from the same sword

219
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:14,751
and it seems like a defensive wound.

220
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:18,588
And his fractured fingers were most likely
caused on the day of the murder.

221
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,423
- Any other defensive wounds?
- None, sir.

222
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:23,843
Next is his wife, Ms. So Jin-yu.

223
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:27,930
She was found next to the bed
with a paper knife pierced into her chest.

224
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,891
The suspect purposely
raised the temperature of the heater

225
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:31,768
in order to decompose the body.

226
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:35,688
A katana to a paper knife from nowhere?

227
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,940
They decomposed the body
at high temperatures.

228
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:40,651
Are you sure this is the same case?

229
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:43,237
We're looking at whether this was done
by the same suspect

230
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:45,114
and other possibilities.

231
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:46,324
What about the CCTV footage?

232
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:49,744
I'm sure they were rich enough
to install CCTVs around the big house.

233
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:53,790
Apparently, the security company
removed all the CCTVs on the 20th.

234
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,666
What? Why?

235
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:58,544
We don't know the reason,
but Dr. Choi requested it.

236
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,506
Damn it.

237
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,806
There was an accident in the alley
near Choi Jin-tae's house.

238
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:14,060
We acquired CCTV footage
around Choi Jin-tae's house.

239
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,520
Yes, that one.

240
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,438
It's around 23:30, 20 seconds in.

241
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,322
What's going on?

242
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:32,995
Did you look up the car?

243
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,372
Yes, it's unlicensed.

244
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,666
An unlicensed vehicle?
Where did he go after this?

245
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,751
We're still looking into
the footage of nearby CCTVs.

246
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:42,672
So the kid was alive until then.

247
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:47,176
Look into records of emergency patients
on the night of the 21st.

248
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:50,054
We should find the kid first!

249
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:51,305
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

250
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:55,476
And you, come with me.

251
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:57,061
Yes, sir.

252
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,502
What should I do first, sir?

253
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,796
I don't know.
What do you want to do first?

254
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:28,134
Should I look into the hospital records
on the night of the 21st?

255
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,178
Or call the security company?

256
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:33,097
And as soon as the bank opens,

257
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:35,683
I'll request
Dr. Choi's transaction history.

258
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,476
Hey, first of all,

259
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:39,604
you should sleep.

260
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:40,980
Sorry?

261
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:42,857
You should get some sleep.

262
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,276
It's six in the morning.
We need to sleep to work.

263
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,402
Right.

264
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,737
Yes, sir.

265
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,742
- Should I get you cigarettes?
- Forget it.

266
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:57,121
Stop kissing up to him

267
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:58,539
and work when the sun's up.

268
00:24:58,873 --> 00:24:59,874
Go to bed!

269
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:04,462
Ju-hyeok, you're going to pass out
if you use up your energy already.

270
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:06,005
- I mean--
- Put that down.

271
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:07,632
Go sleep.

272
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:16,682
Hey.

273
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:22,146
Hey, let me try one.

274
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:25,566
Does this help?

275
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,485
I'm just trying to resist the temptation.

276
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:28,653
Goodness.

277
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:31,489
Props to you for trying to quit.

278
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:33,199
When you grow old,

279
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:36,535
it's hard to become resolute.

280
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,210
How long has it been
since you came to Youngin?

281
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,171
A little over three years.

282
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:51,092
That means Youngin was a peaceful city

283
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:52,802
without a single murder case

284
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:56,264
for a little over three years.

285
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:57,598
Jeez.

286
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:00,768
What's all this chaos
in such a peaceful city?

287
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,775
- If you have something to say, go ahead.
- What?

288
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,568
I don't have anything to say.

289
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:14,490
I love guys like you,

290
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,033
especially in this situation.

291
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,953
You don't do office politics

292
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:20,871
or use petty tricks.

293
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:24,792
It's reliable at times
that you push forward like a bull.

294
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,669
It's great.

295
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:30,339
- Was that a compliment or a criticism?
- Goodness me.

296
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:32,800
You're not even the type to be swayed

297
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,552
by either of those things anyway.

298
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:38,931
I heard you were sent here
for being stubborn.

299
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:43,519
Then...

300
00:26:47,148 --> 00:26:48,399
keep being stubborn.

301
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,571
No one's going to bother you here.

302
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:09,920
Are we moving?

303
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:13,507
Yes, just in case.

304
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:16,969
I thought we were going to the hospital.

305
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,138
Put your jacket on.

306
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:22,767
You may have to be hospitalized
if we go to the hospital.

307
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:27,063
I'm sorry to break it to you,
but I'm completely fine.

308
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,065
The doctor might think differently.

309
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:32,234
You finally sound like a proper dad.

310
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,445
You're worthy to be called a dad.

311
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:36,447
What?

312
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,656
You saved me.

313
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,410
Of course, you're the one
who left me alone at night,

314
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:43,496
but you saved me in the end.

315
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:45,873
So I guess you're worthy
to be called a dad.

316
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,005
This.

317
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:55,007
Why are you taking that?

318
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:56,467
This saved me too.

319
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:58,969
I feel at peace when I have this.

320
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:37,758
<i>Your call cannot be completed.</i>

321
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:39,510
<i>You will be connected to voicemail.</i>

322
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:42,054
<i>You will be charged after the beep.</i>

323
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:47,143
I'm going to send Ro-hee home

324
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,311
and turn myself in.

325
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:51,522
I don't care about money.

326
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:54,233
I have to send her back
before things blow up.

327
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,779
Also,

328
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:01,323
don't worry.

329
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:05,119
I'm going to go see Hee-ae,
turn myself in,

330
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:07,455
and tell the police
that I planned all this.

331
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:11,625
So take good care of Hee-ae
while I'm gone.

332
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,212
This is my final request, okay?

333
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:19,884
Please stay by her side, okay?

334
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:21,760
Please.

335
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:26,140
<i>Recording finished.</i>

336
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:35,608
It didn't look like you were on the phone.

337
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:37,693
Did you leave a voicemail for someone?

338
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:41,030
Yes, there's a brat who never picks up.

339
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,951
Goodness, stop staring. Let's go.

340
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:47,828
Don't you have something to ask me
before we go?

341
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:49,121
A question?

342
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,332
You should ask me to see if I'm hungry.

343
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:53,000
Oh, are you hungry?

344
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,544
All right, let's go have something good.

345
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:56,754
Something good?

346
00:29:57,838 --> 00:30:00,841
That white, unpleasant thing?

347
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:03,344
No. Something really good.

348
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:04,345
What's going on?

349
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:07,973
That doesn't sound like
someone who's in poverty.

350
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:12,269
And starting today,
let's sleep somewhere warm and safe.

351
00:30:12,353 --> 00:30:13,395
Where are we going?

352
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,022
Somewhere.

353
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:19,109
Come on.

354
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:23,697
<i>Why did the murderer take the kid?</i>

355
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:26,075
STATE-NOMINATED BEST MEDICAL CENTERS
CELEBRATION EVENT

356
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,117
It's strange.

357
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:28,911
When you kidnap a kid,

358
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:31,539
you usually negotiate with their parents.

359
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,582
But why kill them instead?

360
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,001
They might not be after money.

361
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:38,879
All the valuables on So Jin-yu's body

362
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,091
and the dollars Choi Jin-tae had
were both untouched.

363
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:44,051
They might be after something else?

364
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,011
That's terrifying.

365
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:47,555
Did he kill the kid then?

366
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:51,809
We need to find out what he's after.

367
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:57,439
Are you the police that are visiting?

368
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,527
This is Detective Park Sang-yun.

369
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,903
And I'm Chae Jeong-man.

370
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,531
I'm Yoon Jeong-do.

371
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:10,244
Please come this way.

372
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:11,912
Sure.

373
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:18,669
I heard he was on vacation.

374
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:19,878
Yes.

375
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:24,174
We were all surprised to see him
go on a vacation all of a sudden.

376
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,428
Although he went on vacation every year,

377
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,847
he often came to work on his days off.

378
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,266
He was very devoted to his work

379
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,393
to the point he had a laboratory at home.

380
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:37,688
And weirdly, he mentioned Singapore.

381
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:39,773
- Singapore?
- Yes.

382
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:43,819
He said he was going to Singapore
for vacation.

383
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:47,114
Excuse me.

384
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,745
Do you know anything more
about his vacation?

385
00:31:53,037 --> 00:31:55,080
No, that's all I know.

386
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,458
I heard you were the closest to Mr. Choi.

387
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,002
We weren't exactly close,

388
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:03,255
but I talked to him more than others.

389
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:04,381
That's about it.

390
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:09,219
- And this is just my speculation,
- Go ahead.

391
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:11,055
but it didn't look like his wife

392
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:13,641
went on vacation with him.

393
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:15,726
Did something happen between them?

394
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:18,437
How would I know
about their personal matters?

395
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:23,525
But sometimes, he would raise his voice

396
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:25,569
when he was on the phone.

397
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:28,113
And the other person on the line
was always his wife.

398
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:30,324
He was an extremely busy man,

399
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:32,534
so I'm sure she had her complaints.

400
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:37,498
Is there anything else you can think of?

401
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:41,210
No, this is all I can think of for now.

402
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:42,586
I see.

403
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,422
I'm sorry I couldn't help much.

404
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:46,840
It's fine.

405
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,468
Right, one last thing.

406
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:52,805
Do you recognize him?

407
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:57,518
No, I don't think so.

408
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:00,354
I see.

409
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:04,024
I know this isn't the best time,
but thank you for meeting with us.

410
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:05,651
- No problem.
- All right.

411
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,449
- Goodbye then.
- Goodbye.

412
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:17,496
Then...

413
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,332
Hey, let me call you back later.

414
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:24,712
It turns out he called a Singaporean
travel agency multiple times.

415
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:26,797
I guess he really was going to Singapore.

416
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:29,758
But what's strange
is that he bought two tickets

417
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:31,385
for himself and Choi Ro-hee.

418
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:33,846
- Without his wife?
- Yes.

419
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:37,850
He contacted a local travel agency
to book the tickets.

420
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:38,851
It was a small agency.

421
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:41,145
Look into that Singaporean travel agency.

422
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:42,980
Someone might've introduced them to him.

423
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:44,398
Yes, sir.

424
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:46,316
But that doctor is so calm

425
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,861
considering the gravity of this case.

426
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:50,446
I mean, his colleague died.

427
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:53,949
Everyone seems suspicious at first, right?

428
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,200
That's just his personality.

429
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:58,036
Stay calm when things get intense.

430
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,872
That's the basics of an investigation.

431
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,751
Yes, sir. Let's stay calm.

432
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,337
Shall we go eat calmly?

433
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:09,923
Hey.

434
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:12,718
Really?

435
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,178
Okay, I'll be on my way.

436
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:16,889
Where to?

437
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:19,725
What? This is near my house.

438
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:20,726
Don't you know this case?

439
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:22,644
- No, what is it?
- A murder case.

440
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:24,146
A couple got stabbed to death.

441
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:25,564
What? Why?

442
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:28,567
It wasn't just an ordinary knife.
It was a long sword.

443
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,569
It pierced right through his chest.

444
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,362
Watch it. There's a kid.

445
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:33,614
- Right.
- Hey.

446
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,200
Gosh, you're so insensitive.

447
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:38,452
- It's not like I made up the story.
- Gosh.

448
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:40,496
Let me see.

449
00:34:56,804 --> 00:34:57,638
Hee-ae.

450
00:34:58,931 --> 00:34:59,765
Hee-ae.

451
00:35:03,227 --> 00:35:04,269
Hee-ae.

452
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:09,858
Hee-ae.

453
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:14,780
Hee-ae.

454
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,283
Hee-ae!

455
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:20,452
Hee-ae!

456
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:22,496
Hee-ae!

457
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:25,999
- Where did you hide Hee-ae?
- Please calm down!

458
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:28,293
How could you kick a patient out
for overdue bills?

459
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:30,420
- Who are you talking about?
- Hee-ae!

460
00:35:30,504 --> 00:35:31,839
The patient in Room 804!

461
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:34,007
- Where's Kim Hee-ae?
- Mr. Kim.

462
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:36,510
She can't even breathe properly.

463
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:39,680
- Please calm down.
- How could you do this to her?

464
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:41,598
I said I'll pay the bills.

465
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:43,517
She moved rooms, remember?

466
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:46,478
She moved rooms.

467
00:35:50,274 --> 00:35:51,149
Sorry?

468
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,570
Patient Kim Hee-ae's

469
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:58,031
hospital bill has been paid for,
including her surgery and nursing fees.

470
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:01,201
We've booked the surgery
after the payment was made.

471
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:02,327
It's on June 5th.

472
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:04,705
Who made the payment?

473
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:08,292
It says that you made the payment.

474
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:09,626
You really didn't know?

475
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:12,713
But it's a relief.

476
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:16,675
She can finally get surgery and recover.

477
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:19,636
She'll be able to live happily with you.

478
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:20,846
Right.

479
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:32,107
<i>Her surgery has been booked for June 5th.</i>

480
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:51,543
What?

481
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:57,257
What the...

482
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,186
- Where were you?
- The bathroom.

483
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:10,646
You should've told me before going.

484
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:13,065
How am I supposed to tell you
when I don't know where you are?

485
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:17,277
Are you sick?

486
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:18,904
What did the doctor say?

487
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,405
It's a stomachache.

488
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,702
You came to a hospital this big
for a stomachache?

489
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:28,538
Hold on.

490
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:30,666
Why did you eat that made you sick?

491
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,002
You ate something behind my back,
didn't you?

492
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,839
Goodness, I didn't.

493
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:41,051
Let's go eat.

494
00:37:59,403 --> 00:38:00,612
Hello.

495
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:04,658
When did you find the vehicle?

496
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:05,993
This morning.

497
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:09,204
We found a burner phone in the car,

498
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,081
and thankfully, we saved the SIM card.

499
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,834
There were two numbers
on the call history.

500
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:15,836
One was another burner phone,

501
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:17,671
and the other was Dr. Choi's number.

502
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,465
- Dr. Choi?
- Yes.

503
00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:22,676
We checked the recent calls,

504
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:25,303
and the call was made after Dr. Choi died.

505
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:28,265
Was the suspect
unaware of Dr. Choi's death?

506
00:38:28,682 --> 00:38:30,559
He might've done it to make an alibi.

507
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:32,144
Any traces of Choi Ro-hee?

508
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:35,272
As you can see, everything's burnt.

509
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:47,743
Did he walk on foot
with the girl from here?

510
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:49,870
What about the CCTV footage?

511
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:52,289
There are none installed in this area.

512
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:55,751
There's a high chance
the culprit is from this area.

513
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:57,419
He knows this place inside out.

514
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:06,720
Where are you going?

515
00:39:08,764 --> 00:39:09,890
Chang-hun, I'll call you.

516
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:11,516
Okay.

517
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:19,960
It hasn't been that long
since he burned the car.

518
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:21,837
Look closely to see

519
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:24,714
if there are any steps
or traces remaining.

520
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:26,299
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

521
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,539
We're monitoring the train station,
bus terminal, and the tollgate, right?

522
00:40:57,622 --> 00:41:00,125
Yes, I told them to inspect
and search thoroughly.

523
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,918
Goodness.

524
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:04,004
I heard you searched the quarry.

525
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:07,757
We found a footstep of an adult male.

526
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:09,384
We're waiting for the forensics.

527
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:14,139
They looked through all the CCTV footage
that was closest to the location

528
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:16,224
- the vehicle was found.
- And?

529
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:19,019
They didn't find anything particular.

530
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:22,480
Where on earth did he take the kid?

531
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:24,941
What's this?

532
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,652
Ex-cons who live in Youngin.

533
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:29,988
Murderers? Kidnappers?

534
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:32,115
Both. We can't narrow it down yet.

535
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:33,909
What about the guy from the CCTV footage?

536
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:38,788
It was blurry, and he was wearing a hat.
It was hard to tell.

537
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,250
Sir.

538
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:45,253
The golden hour has passed.

539
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,715
We should keep this from the press
until we know what's going on.

540
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:51,343
I don't get what the culprit is thinking.

541
00:41:52,594 --> 00:41:55,305
We don't want to provoke him
and put the kid in danger.

542
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:57,057
All right.

543
00:41:58,016 --> 00:41:59,142
Mr. Park Cheol-won is here.

544
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,352
What?

545
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:01,895
Park Cheol-won?

546
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:03,313
He works at the security company

547
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:05,982
that was in charge of the CCTVs
at Choi Jin-tae's hospital and house.

548
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,109
Should I empty the interrogation room?

549
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:10,987
We'll talk in the lounge.

550
00:42:11,655 --> 00:42:12,530
Yes, sir.

551
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:17,202
Here you go.

552
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:20,413
I'm sorry you had to come here.

553
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:22,290
It's all right.

554
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:25,001
A big incident occurred,
so I should help out if I can.

555
00:42:27,796 --> 00:42:30,882
Did you work for Uone Security
for a long time?

556
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,384
Yes.

557
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:34,594
It's been about ten years.

558
00:42:36,096 --> 00:42:38,598
It hasn't been long
since you managed Dr. Choi's house, right?

559
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:43,478
Right. It's been about two years
since I was in charge of his hospital.

560
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:46,523
But he called me about a year ago
and said that he'd prefer

561
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:49,359
to have one person
managing his hospital and his house.

562
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:52,195
So I've been in charge
of his house as well since then.

563
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:55,615
Did you meet him often?

564
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:57,951
- Sorry?
- I don't mean anything else.

565
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:01,454
He designated you
as the manager of both facilities,

566
00:43:01,538 --> 00:43:03,248
so I was wondering

567
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:04,958
if you were close to him.

568
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:07,544
Close to someone like him?

569
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:09,963
Why would he want anything to do
with someone like me?

570
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:11,631
I see.

571
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:15,010
Then let's talk about the 20th.

572
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:17,387
You went to retrieve
the CCTVs that day, right?

573
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,513
Yes.

574
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,099
I was flustered because it was so sudden.

575
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:25,979
But he just said
that he's going to hire another company.

576
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:27,731
Another company?

577
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:28,690
Yes.

578
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:30,567
I asked him which company,

579
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,320
but he avoided the question.

580
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:34,571
I see.

581
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:37,282
Did you find anything unusual that day

582
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:39,367
in terms of his actions
or conversations with him?

583
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:43,705
I'm just a security guy.

584
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:46,416
He had no reason

585
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:48,752
to behave or talk unusually toward me.

586
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:51,463
What did you do on the 21st?

587
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:53,673
The 21st?

588
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:57,052
I'm just asking for formalities.

589
00:43:58,136 --> 00:43:59,512
I see.

590
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:02,932
The last installation ended
past my working time that day,

591
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:04,893
so I got off work from there.

592
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:06,853
I had plans that night.

593
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:08,396
Plans?

594
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,273
Yes, I was meeting a friend
from high school.

595
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,859
We drank until late at night

596
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:14,361
and slept at the sauna.

597
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:16,738
We took a bath,
had hangover soup in the morning,

598
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:18,907
and went to work.

599
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:24,788
Please write
your friend's name and number.

600
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:33,254
KIM HUI-JUNG

601
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:34,672
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

602
00:44:40,095 --> 00:44:41,888
Here. Eat up.

603
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:46,935
I knew it.

604
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,229
This smell of poverty.

605
00:44:49,521 --> 00:44:52,440
What are you talking about?
It's the smell of delicious food.

606
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:53,900
Try it.

607
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:04,452
How is it?

608
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:06,704
It's better than eating expired flour.

609
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:11,793
By the way,
why are we eating on the streets?

610
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:14,045
This is called street food.

611
00:45:14,129 --> 00:45:15,463
You're too young to understand,

612
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:17,132
but street food is much tastier

613
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:19,342
than eating at a restaurant.

614
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:22,929
No matter how delicious it is,
I wonder if we have to eat like this.

615
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,685
It tastes decent.

616
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:34,649
Gosh, why on earth
do these scumbags spit on the floor?

617
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:40,029
Goodness.

618
00:45:40,864 --> 00:45:43,450
Your daughter must take after her mom.

619
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:45,660
Oh, right.

620
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:48,955
Gosh, she looks so pretty and clever.

621
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:51,458
She doesn't take after you at all.

622
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:55,086
- Right.
- Enjoy your food.

623
00:45:56,171 --> 00:45:57,172
Damn it.

624
00:45:59,549 --> 00:46:01,551
She's a weird lady.
Don't mind her and eat up.

625
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:04,053
She has a point.
I don't think I take after you.

626
00:46:05,555 --> 00:46:06,556
Right.

627
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:09,017
Mom seemed pretty.

628
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:11,478
Did you see her?

629
00:46:11,561 --> 00:46:13,354
I saw her in the photos.

630
00:46:13,897 --> 00:46:15,106
Isn't she my mom?

631
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:17,108
So you saw her.

632
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,490
INCOMING CALL

633
00:46:23,573 --> 00:46:25,241
Why are you just staring at your phone?

634
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:26,868
Pick up.

635
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:28,703
Right.

636
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:33,124
Hello?

637
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:34,751
- It's me.
- Hey!

638
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:38,505
What's wrong with you?

639
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,007
Keep eating, okay?

640
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:42,592
I'll be back.

641
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:43,968
Eat up.

642
00:46:51,351 --> 00:46:52,810
So what's going on?

643
00:46:53,186 --> 00:46:55,146
That's what I want to ask.

644
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:57,357
What on earth is going on?

645
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,067
Are you telling me to answer that?

646
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,569
How am I supposed to know? I have no idea.

647
00:47:01,653 --> 00:47:02,904
If you don't, then who...

648
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:04,822
who would?

649
00:47:04,906 --> 00:47:06,950
I found out by watching the news too.

650
00:47:08,076 --> 00:47:09,953
My head is about to burst too.

651
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:11,120
Oh, is it?

652
00:47:11,204 --> 00:47:14,624
I'm about to lose my mind, damn it!

653
00:47:16,793 --> 00:47:19,128
Where are you?
You're not at home, are you?

654
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:21,047
How could I stay there amidst all this?

655
00:47:21,673 --> 00:47:22,882
I'm at the market.

656
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,468
I couldn't stay at the house any longer.

657
00:47:25,552 --> 00:47:28,805
<i>Also, I should hold out as much as I can</i>

658
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:30,223
<i>at least until June 5th.</i>

659
00:47:30,306 --> 00:47:31,558
June 5th?

660
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:33,351
You don't know?

661
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,061
What's happening on June 5th?

662
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:38,898
<i>Can you stop</i>
<i>beating around the bush all the time?</i>

663
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:40,984
<i>Just be straightforward.</i>

664
00:47:41,985 --> 00:47:44,195
Where are you? I'll go to you.

665
00:47:44,279 --> 00:47:45,488
Mister!

666
00:47:47,115 --> 00:47:48,700
Mister!

667
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:50,535
<i>Hello?</i>

668
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:53,288
- Mister!
<i>- What's going on, Myeong-jun?</i>

669
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:55,081
Over here, hurry!

670
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:57,375
Ro-hee!

671
00:47:57,709 --> 00:48:00,587
- What's going on?
- My goodness!

672
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:01,963
Ro-hee!

673
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,923
- The hospital!
- Take her to the hospital!

674
00:48:04,007 --> 00:48:05,508
- My goodness.
- Help me get her on my back.

675
00:48:07,135 --> 00:48:08,428
Wait!

676
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:10,179
Your bags!

677
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:11,889
Hurry!

678
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:14,309
Hurry up!

679
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:20,064
Excuse me! Please check on my daughter.

680
00:48:20,148 --> 00:48:22,317
- She kept puking and is unconscious!
- Calm down, sir.

681
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,985
- I need a doctor now!
- Please calm down.

682
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:26,487
- Call a doctor.
- Dr. Kim! Over here!

683
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:28,239
- Doctor!
- Sir, calm down.

684
00:48:28,323 --> 00:48:29,907
Sir, please calm down.

685
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:31,826
- She puked and fainted.
- This way, please.

686
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:35,121
- Her eyes rolled backward!
- How long has she been unconscious?

687
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:36,664
About ten minutes.

688
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:37,957
Ro-hee!

689
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:39,459
Ro-hee!

690
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:42,253
- Ro-hee!
- Excuse me.

691
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:44,756
Please register your information
while we check on her.

692
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:45,757
Okay.

00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,218

Over here.

703
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:32,512
I found bruises
while administering IV fluids.

704
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:35,306
I think it's child abuse.

705
00:49:36,057 --> 00:49:37,183
Call the police.

706
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:38,101
Okay.

What did you eat today?

720
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:04,228
Today?

721
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:09,108
We had <i>tteokbokki</i>, <i>sundae</i>,
fried squid, fried shrimp--

722
00:51:09,192 --> 00:51:11,152
Is she allergic to shrimp?

723
00:51:11,778 --> 00:51:12,612
Sorry?

724
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:15,198
We administered an antihistamine
to slow down the allergic reaction,

725
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:16,699
and she got better right away.

726
00:51:16,783 --> 00:51:18,326
There must've been something

727
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:20,703
in the food you had today
that caused an allergic reaction.

728
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,288
We'll administer IV fluids today,

729
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:24,832
but please have her take an allergy test
as soon as possible.

730
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:27,210
Okay.

731
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:29,629
Thank you.

732
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:31,380
And please give me the slip.

733
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:33,758
Right, here.

734
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:58,741
Goodbye.

735
00:52:04,163 --> 00:52:06,541
What? Jeez, it's finally working.

736
00:52:08,918 --> 00:52:11,712
All right, let's see.

737
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:13,005
NAME: KIM HEE-AE
GENDER: FEMALE

738
00:52:13,089 --> 00:52:14,715
ADDRESS

739
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:18,970
PATIENT ALREADY HOSPITALIZED

740
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:19,887
What?

741
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:24,267
What the...

742
00:52:25,268 --> 00:52:26,644
- It's so strange.
- What is?

743
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:28,563
It's just weird.

744
00:52:29,105 --> 00:52:30,356
Of course, it's weird.

745
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:33,401
Did you see him
screaming at everyone earlier?

746
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:35,319
There's something suspicious.

747
00:52:35,403 --> 00:52:36,821
Where are the police?

748
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:38,197
What if he runs away?

749
00:52:38,281 --> 00:52:39,490
When did you call the police?

750
00:52:39,574 --> 00:52:40,867
Did you take the pictures?

751
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:42,785
- Of course.
- Don't look at him.

752
00:52:44,245 --> 00:52:45,329
Keep your voices down.

753
00:52:45,872 --> 00:52:47,665
Tell the police to come quickly.

754
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:51,127
I'm telling you,
there's something suspicious.

755
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:52,879
It's so suspicious.

756
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:56,048
How could a dad not know
about his daughter's allergies?

757
00:52:56,132 --> 00:52:57,216
Dad.

758
00:52:58,384 --> 00:53:00,052
Hey, are you okay?

759
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:03,848
Why are you getting up?

760
00:53:06,726 --> 00:53:07,935
I need to go to the bathroom.

761
00:53:08,978 --> 00:53:09,896
Right.

762
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:11,939
Can you manage? Are you not dizzy?

763
00:53:12,315 --> 00:53:13,232
I can go.

764
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:16,777
Here.

765
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:21,532
Can you give me my backpack?

766
00:53:22,617 --> 00:53:23,701
Why?

767
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:29,206
Really?

768
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:30,708
They're going somewhere.

769
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:33,044
- They are?
- They're taking the bag too.

770
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:38,299
The dad's bag is still there.

771
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:39,467
Aren't they running away?

772
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:40,801
Apparently, she has leukemia.

773
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,305
How could he hit a kid like that?

774
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:45,848
- I know, right?
- Doctor.

775
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:47,975
Where's Kim Hee-ae?

776
00:53:48,935 --> 00:53:51,145
Wait. It's the ladies' room. You can go.

777
00:53:51,437 --> 00:53:54,190
Gosh, hey!

778
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:55,691
What is it?

779
00:53:58,319 --> 00:53:59,403
What are you doing?

780
00:54:00,321 --> 00:54:01,989
Let's go before the police come.

781
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,157
What?

782
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:07,578
- Did you call?
- Yes.

783
00:54:07,662 --> 00:54:08,537
Right.

784
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:09,956
Oh, this way.

785
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:14,001
Ro-hee!

786
00:54:15,378 --> 00:54:16,379
Are you not going to go?

787
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:20,091
Do I go with them then?

788
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:24,887
Just follow me.

789
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,767
- Excuse me!
- Excuse me!

790
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:32,561
Hey!

791
00:54:35,398 --> 00:54:36,232
Hey!

792
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:45,700
Are you okay?

793
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:49,537
Sir, a report from the emergency center
at Youngin Hospital came in.

794
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,788
Apparently, it's child abuse.

795
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:52,164
- Abuse?
- Yes.

796
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:54,750
But take a look at her face.

797
00:54:58,462 --> 00:54:59,797
- Choi Ro-hee?
- Yes.

798
00:55:01,382 --> 00:55:03,384
I am his friend from high school,

799
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:05,052
but we met after such a long time.

800
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,847
He called me out of the blue

801
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:09,724
and invited me for a drink.

802
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:14,603
We probably had
five or six bottles of soju.

803
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,813
Goodness.

804
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,607
He wouldn't let me go home.

805
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:22,903
So that was your first time seeing him
since you graduated high school, right?

806
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,655
Yes, that's right.

807
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:27,616
I wonder how he found my number.

808
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:33,205
By the way,
did Cheol-won do something bad?

809
00:55:33,289 --> 00:55:36,125
No, these questions
are merely part of the procedure.

810
00:55:37,043 --> 00:55:41,005
He's kind-hearted,
so he may get taken advantage of,

811
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,841
but he isn't the type to cause harm.

812
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:55,227
- Hey.
<i>- We received a tip on Choi Ro-hee.</i>

813
00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:03,486
Stop right there.

814
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:06,530
An allergy?

815
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:09,241
Yes, it seemed like
she was allergic to shrimp.

816
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:11,410
She suddenly had a seizure and passed out.

817
00:56:11,494 --> 00:56:12,828
I guess he didn't know she was allergic.

818
00:56:12,912 --> 00:56:14,955
He was crying with her on his back
when he came in.

819
00:56:15,623 --> 00:56:16,457
Crying?

820
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:19,001
Yes, he looked very worried
and in a hurry.

821
00:56:19,085 --> 00:56:21,170
So we obviously thought he was her dad.

822
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:23,964
I heard you reported child abuse.

823
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:25,925
When I was injecting a needle,

824
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:28,427
I found severe bruises
and needle marks on her arm.

825
00:56:28,844 --> 00:56:30,554
I reported it as child abuse
based on that.

826
00:56:33,057 --> 00:56:33,933
Sir.

827
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:39,522
The patient registered was Kim Hee-ae,
not Choi Ro-hee.

828
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:41,816
We checked the ID number
and the name just in case.

829
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:44,610
- And?
- She's a patient in this hospital.

830
00:56:45,778 --> 00:56:47,279
Oh, and the guardian...

831
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:48,906
is him.

832
00:56:50,825 --> 00:56:53,077
His name is Kim Myeong-jun, 39 years old.

833
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:00,501
<i>It's strange.</i>

834
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:03,295
<i>He came to the hospital</i>
<i>with the girl he kidnapped,</i>

835
00:57:03,379 --> 00:57:06,215
<i>and he used his daughter's name,</i>
<i>who's a patient here, to register her.</i>

836
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:08,759
<i>Is he dumb or is he playing games?</i>

837
00:57:09,301 --> 00:57:10,177
Hee-ae.

838
00:57:13,848 --> 00:57:16,100
Hee-ae, is your arm okay?

839
00:57:19,562 --> 00:57:20,437
What's wrong?

840
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:29,321
Last night, in the alley,

841
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:33,075
I heard the name Ro-hee.

842
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,953
Ro-hee!

843
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:47,173
I have a question.

844
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:55,014
Who are you?

845
00:58:40,643 --> 00:58:42,228
{\an8}Ro-hee! Hey.

846
00:58:42,311 --> 00:58:43,270
{\an8}Let's go home.

847
00:58:43,354 --> 00:58:46,190
{\an8}<i>A police car in front of the house.</i>
<i>The siren light.</i>

848
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:47,358
{\an8}<i>A cop is the culprit?</i>

849
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:49,360
{\an8}You kidnapped me,
so you should take responsibility!

850
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:51,862
{\an8}- Take responsibility for what?
- <i>My safety.</i>

851
00:58:51,946 --> 00:58:54,240
{\an8}<i>"Agreement."</i>
<i>What is this, a slave contract?</i>

852
00:58:54,323 --> 00:58:55,866
{\an8}- Sign it!
- Fine!

853
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:57,701
{\an8}- Let's go.
<i>- We received a report of a suspicious man.</i>

854
00:58:57,785 --> 00:58:59,745
{\an8}<i>Apparently, he's with a girl</i>
<i>who's about 11 years old.</i>

855
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:01,455
{\an8}<i>I wonder how you kidnapped me.</i>

856
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,832
{\an8}It's not like I wanted to. I was told to.

857
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:04,833
{\an8}You were told to?

858
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:07,211
{\an8}Are you the murderer?

859
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:11,298
{\an8}<i>The girl doesn't</i>
<i>consider the kidnapper hostile.</i>

860
00:59:11,382 --> 00:59:14,176
{\an8}<i>They're moving together</i>
<i>as if they're a team.</i>

861
00:59:14,677 --> 00:59:17,721
{\an8}<i>I'm sure the police already know</i>
<i>what kind of person you are.</i>
