1
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,491
I'm still here.

2
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:37,078
Inside the body of your cousin
whom you love dearly.

3
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,172
Yes, you're correct.

4
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,550
I'm Cha Young-min.

5
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,221
What? Are you shocked
that I revealed myself?

6
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,598
Are you upset?

7
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:59,893
How dare you sabotage
an operation I performed!

8
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:04,439
You take a person's life that lightly?

9
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,733
How is this possible?

10
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,197
It doesn't matter how I'm here.

11
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,910
Now that you know, what will you do?

12
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,246
Go tell everyone that I became a ghost.

13
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,915
You'll be called insane.

14
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:26,669
Doesn't matter to me. I'm already a ghost.
But what about you?

15
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,424
Aren't you pushed into a corner?

16
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,092
Do a quick calculation.

17
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:36,262
You're a calculating person.
You plotted with Jang Min-ho before.

18
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,474
I'm not an idiot.

19
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,684
How could I when Dr. Cha

20
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,604
is our star surgeon
who brings in the money?

21
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,774
Then figure out how much more I owe you.

22
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,276
Tell me when you're done.

23
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,282
You said you weren't an idiot.

24
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,122
You told Jang I brought in the money.

25
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,293
So…

26
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,548
you better not do any harm to me.

27
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:15,593
When I wake up from my coma,
I'll make money again.

28
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,970
And I'm warning you.

29
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,807
If you ever tamper with my patients again…

30
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,399
You already committed numerous crimes,
haven't you?

31
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,443
So stop committing more.
Stay out of trouble…

32
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,157
until the day I come for you.

33
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,015
Are you crazy? Why did you reveal that?

34
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,311
I didn't want to reveal it
but I lost my temper.

35
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:09,856
I lost control. But he seemed to
already knew it was me.

36
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,524
We got found out.

37
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,110
But you should've denied it.
Use your common sense.

38
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:16,779
Do you have anger management issues?
What were you thinking?

39
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:17,864
But they…

40
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,160
They used Dr. Jang to rile me up.

41
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,204
What can I do about it now?
Should I take it all back?

42
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,206
-That I was faking it?
-Do you think that'll work?

43
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,541
Hey.

44
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,544
I'm sorry. I put on
a great performance though.

45
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,756
So how do you expect him to react?

46
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,385
It's hard to tell.
I think I scared him pretty good.

47
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,845
Any sane person would be scared.

48
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,723
He knew the conversation I had
with Jang Min-ho.

49
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,600
Only the two of us were there,

50
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,393
but he knew everything I said.

51
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,395
Dr. Cha was watching us.

52
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,316
He really said that?

53
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,110
He said he was Dr. Cha?

54
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,738
You think I'm kidding?
I've said it again and again.

55
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,325
If this is true
then Dr. Cha knows everything we did.

56
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,370
Who would he have
the biggest grudge against?

57
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,372
Me? No, not me.

58
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:10,833
It would be you.
He was your mentor, but you betrayed him.

59
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:16,839
How is this possible?
He's in a coma and not even dead yet.

60
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,259
Why did he have to possess my cousin?

61
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,844
They weren't even on good terms.

62
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,431
What are you going to do?

63
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,059
Don't ask me!

64
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:33,356
Maybe he's behind you now.

65
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,617
He must be terrified.

66
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,620
Anyway, he won't be able
to make any moves.

67
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,789
I scared the daylight out of him.

68
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,291
That's just great.

69
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,459
I did a number on him.

70
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,546
And was the operation a success?

71
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,715
Of course. I didn't let them distract me.

72
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,759
All right then. It's spilled milk.

73
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,303
Let's not stress over it.

74
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,597
You just finished a tough operation.
Don't let that deflate you.

75
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:10,560
Just focus on the patient's recovery.
And see to it that he wakes up.

76
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,433
Mr. Han seemed to know
that you can see ghosts.

77
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,310
He said you had a condition before.

78
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,519
Where you saw things.

79
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,189
So he knows.

80
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,483
I had a hunch.

81
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,277
I guess that's how he found out
and believed you were in me.

82
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,030
Tell me

83
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,699
how it happened to you.

84
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,787
Or is it too personal?

85
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,376
I had a scary incident.

86
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,213
It was terrifying.

87
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,049
Because I was just eight at the time.

88
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,302
I almost died in an accident, but lived.

89
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,264
After that, I could see ghosts.

90
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:34,060
It took me a while
to realize they were ghosts though.

91
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,728
It was scary,

92
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,233
but I kept getting closer
and coming to the hospital.

93
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,242
To check if I could
actually see them or not.

94
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,718
I was hoping I wouldn't see them.

95
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,097
When I would see one, I'd run away.

96
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,184
I dreaded living like that
for the rest of my life.

97
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,562
I even thought of suicide.

98
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,234
I had all sorts of thoughts.

99
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,863
But I eventually came back
because I wanted to live.

100
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,101
I controlled my fear.

101
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,521
I practiced pretending
I couldn't see them.

102
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:07,945
This is no fun.

103
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:15,828
After ten years of practice,
I thought I had overcome it.

104
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,663
But there was one thing
I couldn't overcome.

105
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,876
Now pay attention.

106
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,503
Seung-tak, incision.

107
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,992
Would it hurt…

108
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,746
if you cut me with that?

109
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,711
Hey, Seung-tak!

110
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,339
I don't want to do it.

111
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,676
-Where are you going?
-What?

112
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,637
I couldn’t do it.

113
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,018
Even though I couldn't do it myself,
I could let you instead.

114
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,979
I thought it was swell.

115
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,855
Though it wasn't me,

116
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,567
I was contributing in a way.

117
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,321
If I wake up,

118
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,950
you have four more years of residency.
What will you do?

119
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,411
On top of that, Mr. Han knows about us.

120
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,708
I'm not going to work
as a doctor for long anyway.

121
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,587
So let's work harder
to get this over with.

122
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,172
You can handle these operations
after you wake up.

123
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,343
And I'll let you
borrow my body until then.

124
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,285
I heard the rumors.

125
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,788
But I didn't expect a first-year resident
to do that well.

126
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,128
Young-min, were you aware
of Dr. Koh's astounding skills?

127
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,297
Is…

128
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,758
Is it even possible?

129
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,595
In a previous cardiac sarcoma operation,

130
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:42,058
Dr. Cha accidentally touched the cannula
and the air got in.

131
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,435
The patient's blood pressure dropped.
We almost lost him.

132
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,604
What? When did I do that?

133
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,233
Dr. Cha.

134
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,243
Is Dr. Cha showing any signs
of improvement?

135
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,330
Mind your manners. Say hello first.

136
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,499
You ask that several times a day.

137
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,751
Like I said before, no signs so far.

138
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,671
But the patient recovered nicely.

139
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,757
Is it because of stress?

140
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,009
Sorry for causing you stress.

141
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,428
I didn’t know you were operating.

142
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,222
What?

143
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,350
You came to observe my operation.

144
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:27,186
Say you're sorry. I yelled at her.

145
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,145
Why should I?

146
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,190
I usually don't do that.

147
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,527
I'm sorry for yelling at you.

148
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,529
That's all right.

149
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,532
But I'm puzzled about what was going on.

150
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,283
What?

151
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,161
Hey, just tell her
you were kidding around.

152
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,705
And then let's leave.
Don’t forget to say bye.

153
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,083
I was kidding around. I'll say bye now.

154
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,544
How did you know about that?

155
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,171
What?

156
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,589
What is it now?

157
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,467
Even Bo-mi's primary care doctor
and her mother

158
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,052
didn't know about her nosebleed.

159
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:02,972
That's…

160
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,474
I heard it from her.

161
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,976
Are you kidding…

162
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,691
I think it came to me in a dream.

163
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,818
How do you know the patient?

164
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,611
It doesn't seem like you're friends.

165
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,197
She's a friend of a friend.

166
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,074
Good answer.

167
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,076
He's quick on his feet.

168
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,954
Why did you come and observe my surgery?

169
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,290
Mr. Han asked me
to bring my contract extension.

170
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:34,753
I was going to only stay for a bit
but I needed to stay longer.

171
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,758
Will you go back
after that contract expires?

172
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,303
I don't know.

173
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,263
I haven't decided yet.

174
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,569
He scared me. What is he doing there?

175
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,363
Is it Seung-tak or Dr. Cha?

176
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,408
What was that? Why did she
suddenly ask so many questions?

177
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,626
She says she extended her contract.
So we bought more time.

178
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,837
Wake up from your coma before then
and ask her to stay.

179
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,302
So what happened in the operating room?

180
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,095
You said you were kidding around.

181
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,972
But nobody does that during surgery.

182
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,196
Yes. I'm coming.

183
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,055
Nothing out of the normal happened
to the patient during surgery.

184
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,778
What if I were to pull these tubes?

185
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,700
I've got a lot of questions.

186
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,161
And the biggest question I have is…

187
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,711
why the heck would you do this?

188
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,796
What for?

189
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,385
EUNSANG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

190
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,813
The morning sun is so nice today.

191
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,526
Hey Seung-tak.

192
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,903
Hi. Good morning, Crystal.

193
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,158
What the?

194
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,286
Where is he going in a hurry?

195
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,081
Did something happen?

196
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,594
The doctors are praising Seung-tak
so much.

197
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,263
His skills are improving
at a remarkable rate.

198
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:35,059
There's even a rumor
that he's possessed by a spirit.

199
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:38,187
They say he's possessed?

200
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,064
He's a miracle worker?

201
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,360
Is he going to become famous?

202
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,488
You and Dr. Cha weren't on good terms.

203
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,951
Did he blackmail you?
Or did you cut a deal?

204
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,705
What did you promise him?

205
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,960
How about we make a deal?

206
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,630
If you repent what you did
before Dr. Cha wakes up,

207
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,423
I'll consider forgiving you.

208
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,511
I don't want you to be charged
with a crime.

209
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,262
You're my cousin.

210
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,602
Is that why you didn't uncover everything?

211
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,897
Will Dr. Cha expose the rest of it
when he wakes up?

212
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,983
We'll have to see what happens.

213
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,735
What if Dr. Cha dies?

214
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,449
We'll see when that happens, right?

215
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,835
Dr. Koh? Why are you here
early in the morning?

216
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:46,130
I came to check on Dr. Cha.

217
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,297
And say hello.

218
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,842
Where is Dr. Jang?

219
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,677
She had surgery scheduled.

220
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,179
It probably began.

221
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,556
Yes, I forgot.

222
00:16:58,475 --> 00:16:59,476
Just a minute.

223
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,607
After you get well after the operation,

224
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,529
finish your thesis, okay?

225
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:14,116
Your peers already defended their theses
and got their Ph.D. degrees.

226
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,492
But it's okay.

227
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,952
You'll catch up in no time.

228
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,038
You can do it since you're my daughter.

229
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:22,166
Please recover. I'll help you.

230
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,459
Just get better.

231
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,712
Let's go.

232
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,475
Gosh. Why are you getting sad?

233
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,894
The doctor says you'll wake up
if it goes well.

234
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:46,148
So don't dwell on that complicated stuff.
Focus on waking up.

235
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,234
All right, let's not stay here. Come on.

236
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,360
Let's go, too.

237
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,578
Yes, she's in the operating unit.

238
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,164
It'll take an hour or two.
We'll have to see.

239
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,254
We don't need a long farewell.

240
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,090
Let's…

241
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,300
part ways here.

242
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,512
Take care.

243
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:18,639
Good luck.

244
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,562
Did he have to do that?

245
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,193
Try to understand him. You know how it is.

246
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,779
If the operation goes well,
your spirit can enter your body.

247
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:38,367
He doesn't want
to see you suddenly disappear.

248
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,247
You stay right here, okay?

249
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,498
You know why, right?

250
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,876
And wake up no matter what.

251
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:08,981
Female, 29. Rule-out meningitis.
Right EVD procedure.

252
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,441
The expected duration
is less than an hour.

253
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,986
I'll need a drill and catheter.
Are we clear?

254
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,946
-Yes.
-Then we'll begin.

255
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,781
Scalpel.

256
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,175
Are you here
to see the patient or Dr. Jang?

257
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,051
Both.

258
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,678
What about you?

259
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,265
Me? What is it?

260
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,017
Look at you.

261
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,853
I'm always the one
to clean up the mess you make.

262
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,898
I created a mess?
What kind? What did I do?

263
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:55,319
Because of you, I skip my meals
and get woken up in my sleep.

264
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,742
Doctor.

265
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,703
What are you doing here?

266
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,372
Who were you talking to?

267
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,208
What? Was I?

268
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,126
With who?

269
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,380
There's no one here.

270
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,382
Who were you talking to?

271
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,551
I wasn't talking to anyone.

272
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,471
But what brings you here?

273
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,599
You're not supposed
to be walking around already.

274
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:26,808
Come on. Follow me.

275
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,082
Why is it so quiet?

276
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,333
Can't be the calm before a storm.

277
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:54,753
Let's go.

278
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,344
Keep an eye on your patients.

279
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,345
What?

280
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,724
Seung-jo, you went out?

281
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,769
Hey, I told you to stay inside.

282
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,854
Hurry inside. Your mom
is probably looking for you.

283
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,356
Okay, Doctor.

284
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,359
Hey, don't run.

285
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,070
Gosh. He doesn't listen.

286
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:23,365
Anything happen?

287
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,033
Any strange rumors going around?

288
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,952
A rumor? Like what?

289
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:30,163
I mean the staff talks
about me all the time.

290
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,251
Seung-tak.

291
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,129
I don't care if you're
possessed or an alien.

292
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,132
So let's ride this wave. Until the end.

293
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,259
What?

294
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,427
Well, you see…

295
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,930
I gave it some thought,
and I think you're protecting me.

296
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,473
From evil beings.

297
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,643
So let's see this to the end.

298
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,270
See what to the end?

299
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,813
Go alone and don't come back.

300
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,239
Maybe I should've said zombie
instead of alien.

301
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,709
-Did her spirit enter?
-Yes, she's inside.

302
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,837
It's wonderful.

303
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,757
It's great, right?

304
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,216
Good for her.

305
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:25,802
What is?

306
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,431
Why are you so frightened?
You've never seen a ghost?

307
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,517
I thought you returned to your body.

308
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,604
They inserted a tube into my head.

309
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,857
So now they'll be able to
inject antibiotics directly into me

310
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,484
and monitor my condition.

311
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:44,154
If it works, they expect me
to wake up soon.

312
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:47,240
Based on the look on the doctor's face,
I think the procedure went well.

313
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:50,035
It's just the beginning
so let's temper our expectations.

314
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,747
That's what Dr. Cha told me.

315
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:07,302
It seemed like she didn't know
what was happening.

316
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,556
I was merely doing my duty as a doctor.

317
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:16,561
What about before?
What's come over you? This is awkward.

318
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,564
Don't be like that.
He found a way to treat Bo-mi.

319
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,483
And that led to this surgery.

320
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,819
I should've thanked you sooner.

321
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,988
Thank you for finding a way to cure me.

322
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,332
Gosh, Doctor.

323
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:39,793
What's the hurry? You came
right after the operation.

324
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,254
You'll wear yourself out.

325
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:45,799
Nurse Min and I will take turns
caring for him, so take a break for a day.

326
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,677
Go out and get some fresh air.
You need sunlight.

327
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,679
Don't you feel stuffy?

328
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,687
There's fresh air coming in
and this room gets sunlight.

329
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,771
This will do.

330
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,108
He's been here for months too.

331
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:25,422
I haven't been outside in a long time.

332
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,549
Nobody asked you.

333
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,968
You're putting on airs
now that you've helped her.

334
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:33,597
Come on. We don't own this spot either.

335
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,349
I know. It's nice to be out here together.

336
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,937
The sun is so warm today.

337
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,272
I'm also in a good mood.

338
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,733
People need to go out and get sunshine.

339
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,109
It's why we rolled out
the Sunshine Policy.

340
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,485
Sunshine Policy?

341
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,615
Did you wake up already?

342
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,575
You're talking like you're alive.

343
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,080
You're laughing?

344
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,130
Of course, I know that.

345
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,466
I was just cracking a joke.

346
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:13,762
You're senior doctors
but resort to using a first-year resident

347
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,805
to boost your surgery rates
since you lack the skills.

348
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,099
This is no different
from switching doctors.

349
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,726
Are you aware of that?

350
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,519
Gosh. That's not true.

351
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,356
All of us were the lead surgeons
during our operations.

352
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,733
We received a little help from him
as our first assistant.

353
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,985
We did nothing wrong
according to the Medical Act.

354
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,947
I saw one case where the lead surgeon

355
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,533
was not present during the operation
and the resident did it all by himself.

356
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,830
The aortic aneurysm case?

357
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,540
Well, I can explain what happened.

358
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:46,378
I was racing to the hospital
as fast as I could.

359
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:49,631
Then the patient's condition
became critical.

360
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,133
I think you all agreed to
keep this under the wraps.

361
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,845
But I'm not allowing this anymore
since I now know.

362
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,181
This could become a big problem.

363
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,432
All of you

364
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:03,144
may be summoned
by the disciplinary committee.

365
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:24,916
I came again, Doctor.

366
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,376
What are you going to ask this time?

367
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:29,504
I was asked to stay here
starting right now

368
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:34,342
until the evening and look after Dr. Cha.

369
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,928
You were asked to do what?

370
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,267
Hello, Dr. Jang.

371
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,894
Seung-tak just asked me
to check on Dr. Cha

372
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,146
every other hour.

373
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:48,440
Doctor!

374
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,193
Doctor, it's me, Jae-won.

375
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:56,031
I'm sorry for not coming often.
I heard you're improving a little.

376
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,908
You'll wake up soon, right?
You must wake up.

377
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:00,869
Oh my.

378
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,250
Doctor, so you're taking
the afternoon off, right?

379
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,210
That's great. You should go now. Hurry.

380
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,420
I am?

381
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:11,921
The afternoon?

382
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,090
Why don't you take the afternoon off
and go somewhere?

383
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,551
It's autumn. The weather is nice outside.

384
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,805
Thanks for the thought.
It's not necessary though.

385
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,683
-I don't have anywhere to go.
-But there is.

386
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,936
This singer is holding a concert.

387
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,147
Dr. Cha is a big fan of hers.

388
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,440
He's a fan?

389
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:33,902
Dr. Cha likes a singer?

390
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,320
It's a surprise, isn't it?

391
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,905
You should've seen it.

392
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,950
She was Dr. Cha's patient
before she became a singer.

393
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:44,162
She came for a reoperation and asked me
to give the ticket to Dr. Cha.

394
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,831
It's a long story, but the summary is…

395
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,250
I think Dr. Cha would be happy

396
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,961
if you went in his place.

397
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,258
You said you enjoyed
watching her taped concerts.

398
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,260
Wouldn't it be twice as good
to watch her live?

399
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,346
We don't have much time,
so let's make some progress.

400
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:03,181
Well, I'll get to that.

401
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,474
But how can I go?

402
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,018
You're not thinking of…

403
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,854
I guess this is why I dressed up today.

404
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,525
Be careful when you're in my body.
This shirt is a special edition.

405
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,443
Don't put your hands in the pockets.
It'll ruin the fit.

406
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,196
And none of this. No waving light sticks.

407
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,407
If you do that, it's over between us.

408
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,837
What a surprise.

409
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,881
It's right for me to be surprised,
but why are you surprised?

410
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,677
I'm surprised because…

411
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:45,140
I didn't expect you to actually come.

412
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,934
You said I shouldn’t miss it.

413
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,561
How ironic.

414
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,646
I was also asked to not miss this concert.

415
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,440
So Jessica…

416
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,275
No, I mean.

417
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,444
Her actual name is Lee Ji-woo.

418
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,654
I'm her primary care physician.

419
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,449
So I came in case
she has a medical emergency.

420
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:14,252
I have something to tell you all.

421
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:19,924
I recently had open-heart surgery.

422
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,513
My doctor told me I shouldn't perform

423
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,390
for a while.

424
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,518
So today, I'll perform while sitting.

425
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,978
Please understand.

426
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,803
I haven't been outside for a while.
It's nice.

427
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,513
This street is pretty.

428
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,808
Being a heart surgeon is hard, isn't it?

429
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,937
When I was an intern,
I practically lived in the hospital.

430
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,772
That's how it was back then.

431
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,736
Well, it was like that for us.

432
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,989
Nowadays, doctors choose easier fields.

433
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,117
Can I ask you why you chose cardiology?

434
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,870
I made a promise to a girl.

435
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,707
I would be a heart surgeon,
and she would be a brain surgeon.

436
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:10,178
Young-min, let's live together one day.

437
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,221
And let's set up our own clinic.

438
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,932
You'll be a heart surgeon,
and I'll be a neurosurgeon.

439
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,266
What do you think? Marvelous, right?

440
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:20,521
She wanted to set up a clinic with me
after we started living together.

441
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:31,032
You didn't have dinner, right?

442
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,200
No thanks.

443
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,327
I need to return to the hospital.

444
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,204
But we should eat before heading back.

445
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,790
It's all right. I don't have an appetite.

446
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:41,918
Instead of dinner, have something else.

447
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,545
Why isn't he answering his phone?

448
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,173
He's nowhere around. I'm getting worried.

449
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,145
What? Seung-tak…

450
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,403
Why is she with him?

451
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,491
What's that look on his face?

452
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,372
ER

453
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:33,678
Thanks to you, I had a good time.

454
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,513
Me, too.

455
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,432
Bye.

456
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,203
It was a nice date, right?

457
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,706
Did you collect some happy hormones?

458
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:04,000
I did, thanks to you.

459
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,253
I'm helping people out so much.
It's very rewarding.

460
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,465
-What the?
-You said you'd help them.

461
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,758
You promised to buy the walnut snack.

462
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,259
When will you do a favor for me?

463
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,428
Favor?

464
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,555
Do another one.
I want a bag of walnut snacks.

465
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:21,100
Yes, sure. The next favor
is buying walnut snacks.

466
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,145
I just said that out of pressure.

467
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,314
A promise is a promise.

468
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,440
I took care of it
while I was in your body.

469
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:28,483
To save you the effort.

470
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,777
You used my body anyhow.

471
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,658
Yes, Brother.

472
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,410
Seung-tak, we've got trouble.

473
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,079
What kind of trouble?

474
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,580
Did Dr. Cha's condition change?

475
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,916
Seung-jo disappeared.
He shouldn't be running around.

476
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:49,921
You scared me there.
He's probably hiding somewhere.

477
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,255
Seung-jo?

478
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,175
Did you look for him near the lounge?

479
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,635
I'll look for him.

480
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,139
Sorry for going there alone.

481
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:03,184
Next time, let's go together.

482
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,770
The two of us.

483
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:09,398
By the way…

484
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,569
Dr. Koh said

485
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,321
you would like this.

486
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,452
He knows

487
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,497
quite a lot about you.

488
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,627
He is a lot like you.

489
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:43,182
I hope he becomes a doctor
when he grows up.

490
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,767
Then he'll deal
with patients like himself too.

491
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,103
Yes. And be a cardiologist.

492
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:48,688
Seung-jo.

493
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:56,362
Do you know how late it is?
You're supposed to be in bed by nine.

494
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,656
Come on. I'll take you back.

495
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,324
Doctor!

496
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:09,834
You came to see me?

497
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,254
Seung-jo. You're…

498
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:24,182
Hey, kid. Open your eyes.

499
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,079
What the? What's happening?

500
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,248
I was told to check this area.
I found this kid on the floor.

501
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,292
You came alone? Where's Dr. Cha?

502
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,589
Hey, you know? Let's help the kid first.

503
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:58,382
Is he next to you? Dr. Cha!

504
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,550
What? Yes.

505
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:03,679
He's here, I see. Switch places. Now.

506
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:20,905
He's back.

507
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,451
Tracheal intubation first.
Check if he's conscious.

508
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:27,119
What? Okay.

509
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:36,295
Since when did you know?

510
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,800
Probably around the time you knew.

511
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:42,969
You knew from the start?

512
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,513
Then why did you say anything?
Why did you pretend not to know?

513
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:49,809
You never told me about Dr. Cha's spirit
entering your body, did you?

514
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,936
I've heard this somewhere.

515
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,479
But how…

516
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,356
You made things so obvious.

517
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:57,858
Is he around?

518
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,820
Dr. Cha?

519
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,282
Can she see me, too?

520
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,951
Could you stop calling me, "Intern?"

521
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:09,578
You're the only doctor who calls me that.

522
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,831
Seung-tak calls me Crystal.

523
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,959
You should be on the same page
on things like these.

524
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,752
Who calls an intern, "Intern?"

525
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:17,920
What's going on?

526
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:22,633
And when you do a surgery,
please don't do this.

527
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:26,721
Seems like it's your habit, Dr. Cha.
Are you trying to show everyone it's you?

528
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,182
What? You've been
twisting your wrists all along?

529
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:34,061
It's my habit. I do it for good luck
and not to be jinxed.

530
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,147
I'm surprised nobody found out yet.

531
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,983
Straighten out the act
between you two, okay?

532
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:41,193
And I'll act like I always do.
I'll cooperate.

533
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,448
Why are you wearing a suit?

534
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:48,034
I went to an event.

535
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,328
-What event?
-A Jessica concert.

536
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,997
A concert? With whom?

537
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,498
With Dr. Jang.

538
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:57,418
-Why did you go with her?
-It's a long story.

539
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,253
That's not that important.

540
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:03,007
You seem to have a lot of time.
You even go on dates now.

541
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,258
Splendid.

542
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,058
How could she believe all of that?

543
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,811
Even though I slipped up, how could she?

544
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:19,023
She's not an ordinary girl.

545
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:20,941
Did I make it too obvious?

546
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,237
Hey!

547
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,285
Is it tasty?

548
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:39,585
Not that good? How is it not good?
Give me details.

549
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:41,295
It's all right.

550
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,882
It's all right? That's hard to believe.

551
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,217
Isn't it too sweet?

552
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,260
Isn't the dough too dry?

553
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,261
By the way,

554
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,222
who bought this?

555
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,557
What was it like there?
Is it a good location?

556
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:54,725
Were there lots of people?

557
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:55,893
Were there customers?

558
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:58,813
I don't know about the location
but there were many people.

559
00:39:58,896 --> 00:39:59,855
I didn't see

560
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,690
a lot of customers.

561
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:08,739
Would you like to try one? Check it out.

562
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,200
I don't like street food.

563
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:16,455
He's pretty blunt.

564
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:20,251
The two of you rushed to treat the kid
but it seems like you couldn't cure him.

565
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,089
They're glaring at me openly.
Both of them.

566
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,345
They found out?

567
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,349
You held out pretty long.

568
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,436
Why weren't you careful?

569
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,858
You've been around my hospital
for a long time.

570
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,901
I think you should be paying rent.

571
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,947
You used to be a little kid.

572
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:52,199
Now you're all grown up.

573
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,618
Time flies.

574
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,788
You didn't have anywhere to go

575
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,000
until I got this big.
I could find you a place.

576
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,462
Look at you getting fresh.

577
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:09,133
You used to be a nice kid. What happened?

578
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,386
You haven't changed at all
since I saw you as a kid.

579
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,680
I guess you're very old now.

580
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,892
But why haven't you left this place?

581
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:20,728
Most of the spirits disappear
once they die.

582
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,148
Now you ask?

583
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,900
You finally ask me 20 years later?

584
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,488
Everyone has a personal history.

585
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,200
A history that you keep to yourself.

586
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,326
I saw you

587
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,078
when I was a little boy.

588
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:42,917
You knew I could see you.

589
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:46,212
But why did you just pass me by?

590
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,171
For 20 years.

591
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,590
Well, that's because…

592
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,843
you were pretending you couldn't see me.

593
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,845
Why should I acknowledge you?

594
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:58,474
I like that attitude.

595
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,936
I must go. I've got a situation to handle.

596
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:03,854
I'll see you around.

597
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,944
That little kid

598
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:12,696
grew up into a fine man.

599
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:23,749
Where is Seung-jo?

600
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,710
Our ghost friends are looking after him.

601
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,128
He can't see his mom like that.

602
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,464
Did you talk to him?

603
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,383
Yes, we talked.

604
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,635
Why did I miss that?

605
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,971
You've been coming to the hospital

606
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:40,516
and Tess has been here for 20 years.
He already knew you.

607
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,186
He won't stay in a coma, will he?

608
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:45,771
No way.

609
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,898
I'm going to cure him.

610
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:53,279
Jae-won will do a head MRI
and a heart CT scan on him this morning.

611
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,906
You should get some sleep.
I'll watch over Seung-jo.

612
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,834
I don't care he went there,

613
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,253
but why did Dr. Jang also go with him?

614
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:11,338
Is the Neurology Department not busy?

615
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,881
Even I don't have time for that.

616
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,801
Could they have

617
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:19,221
developed feelings for each other? No way.

618
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,641
What am I talking about?

619
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:31,650
Mom, I'm back.

620
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,820
Why are you always late?
You get off at six sharp.

621
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,198
I hung out with some friends after work.

622
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,950
I'm tired after meeting them.

623
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,287
Hello there, baby.

624
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:45,956
What kind of name is that?

625
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,834
Who calls a pet flying squirrel, "baby?"

626
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,962
I think it's an affectionate name.

627
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,633
I guess it is.

628
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:00,054
His pet squirrel is no baby
when it comes to mealtime.

629
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,639
But why isn't he coming for his pet?

630
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,307
He asked you to look after it
for a few days.

631
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,767
He'll come soon.

632
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:09,146
He's been busy lately.

633
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,108
Hey, Soo-jung.

634
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:16,737
My eyes have been bothering me lately.
Could you check my eyes?

635
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,988
You want me to check?

636
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:20,407
Aren't you an ophthalmology intern?
You can't?

637
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,410
Yes. Let me see.

638
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:32,628
Are you getting along
with the senior doctors?

639
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:36,507
Ophthalmology is a competitive field.
You have to make a good impression.

640
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,676
Then you can become a resident.

641
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,678
Of course, I'm getting along.

642
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,850
I think the air is dry here.
Your eyes are dry.

643
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:49,061
It doesn't take an expert to see that.

644
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:52,689
Are you sure you're in ophthalmology?

645
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,401
Of course. I'm in ophthalmology.
I'm an intern there.

646
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,277
You're acting suspiciously.

647
00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:01,407
You're not an intern in ER, cardiology,
or neurology, are you?

648
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:04,034
Why would I intern there? It's too tough.

649
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,536
You promised me.

650
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,705
It's either the eyes, the ears,
the nose, the throat, or the skin.

651
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:11,083
If not, I won't let you become a doctor.

652
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,962
I'm not letting you follow
in your grandpa's footsteps.

653
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:17,840
I know.

654
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:20,759
Mom. Let me examine your eye again.

655
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,098
EUNSANG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

656
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:32,396
-Got some sleep?
-Yes.

657
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,314
How is Seung-jo?

658
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,566
No improvement so far.

659
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:36,942
Who is his primary care physician?

660
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:38,402
Dr. Han.

661
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:40,237
What's the cause?

662
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:41,822
I found it.

663
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,576
He's been running around a lot.

664
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:50,414
After receiving a right
ventricular catheter and CABG,

665
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:51,540
the patient ran a lot after recovering,

666
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:54,293
causing the catheter to apply pressure
on the arteries.

667
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:58,005
A decrease in coronary blood circulation
caused a heart condition.

668
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:05,679
Luckily, we were able
to quickly administer CPR on the patient.

669
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:09,099
The patient's heart returned to normal,
but he remains in a coma.

670
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:12,978
MRI scan shows no brain damage.
We'll have to monitor the patient.

671
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:15,981
The problem is the ventricular catheter.

672
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,065
There.

673
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:19,693
In the heart scan taken this morning…

674
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:22,154
You see this area between the arteries
and the right ventricle.

675
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:24,531
There should be some space here.

676
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,867
Due to his running, the increased
blood flow caused a blockage.

677
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:30,037
You were analyzing
this while I was asleep?

678
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:32,706
You think I was slacking off?

679
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,083
Focus. Here's the solution.

680
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,794
You have to widen the space.

681
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:42,966
So you'll have to move
the ventricular catheter to this point.

682
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:46,053
So we need to operate on him
as soon as possible

683
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,554
to move the ventricular catheter.

684
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:50,599
Dr. Han, let's do the operation today.

685
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,476
What?

686
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:55,938
I have a full schedule
of surgeries today. I can't.

687
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:59,942
Then is there another doctor available?

688
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:05,614
I'll be the first assistant.
It won't be hard for you.

689
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,492
Why are they acting differently?

690
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:09,576
Dr. Ban?

691
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,871
Me?

692
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:18,961
Well, in this case, it's a young child.
And he had a diseased coronary artery.

693
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:22,756
A reoperation so soon could be risky.

694
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,968
Honestly speaking,
the patient hasn't woken up yet.

695
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:28,512
It wouldn't be too late
to hold the reoperation

696
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:30,639
after we check his mental state.
Let's wait a few more days.

697
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:33,392
The lead surgeon,
Mr. Han should handle it.

698
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:38,522
Because Dr. Ahn is not available,
we should wait.

699
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:39,565
Don't forget

700
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:42,234
that I took over the surgeries
Dr. Ahn was supposed to do.

701
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:46,405
Well, speaking of which.

702
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:50,117
Regarding the esophageal cancer operation,
you don't need to do it.

703
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,912
Young-shik will be my first assistant
for the CABG surgery next week.

704
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:54,913
Yes. Me too.

705
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:57,541
For the aortic operation
and MVR operation I'm doing,

706
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,751
Dr. Lee will be my first assistant.

707
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,353
Is this your doing?

708
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:19,563
Are you alone?

709
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,148
Or is he with you?

710
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,150
Let me see.

711
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,318
Seung-tak?

712
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,402
Dr. Cha?

713
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:27,654
Wear a nametag or something.

714
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:30,324
I'm asking if you ordered them
to avoid working with me.

715
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:32,826
You make it sound like
you're the lead surgeon.

716
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:35,829
Why are you doing this?

717
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:38,749
I'm merely doing my job
as the administrative director.

718
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:41,084
It's not normal for a first-year resident

719
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,587
to do the majority of an operation.

720
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,756
It will be a scandal
if the media found out.

721
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,466
That's not the only reason.

722
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,092
Of course, not.

723
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:51,053
I'm curious.

724
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:55,974
Why is Dr. Cha possessing your body
to carry out these surgeries?

725
00:48:56,642 --> 00:49:00,020
Even if I were to ask,
he wouldn't tell me.

726
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:02,648
So I thought I'd block him.

727
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,524
To see what happens next.

728
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:09,112
I can't kill or save Dr. Cha's life.
But this is within my powers.

729
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:12,032
He's a young kid and he's in a coma.

730
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:13,784
Let me operate on him.

731
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:16,870
How can I, when I warned the doctors
about the consequences?

732
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:20,999
Making exceptions will make me look weak
and hurt my authority.

733
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,959
Is that more important than his life?

734
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:34,429
The kid's life

735
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:36,390
means a lot to you?

736
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:41,645
Since we're on the subject,

737
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:44,356
you're not doing this
just for Dr. Cha's sake.

738
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:49,069
You're also doing it
to satisfy your ambition.

739
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:51,947
Isn't that so?

740
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,657
I can't bear to see that.

741
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:58,829
If you want to save the boy,
then tell everyone Dr. Cha is inside you.

742
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:00,997
Or do the surgery

743
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:02,958
on your own

744
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,168
without any help.

745
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:16,054
I warned him to not interfere.

746
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,808
People never change.
And the evil ones are more stubborn.

747
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,393
That piece of crap.

748
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:24,062
Lend me your body.
I'll throw Mr. Han out of the window.

749
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:29,359
What's on your mind? You're spacing out.

750
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:32,112
Where is Seung-jo?

751
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,239
A young calf

752
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:39,202
Is crying on the wood-burning stove

753
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:45,292
Mommy. Mommy. His butt is hot

754
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,128
He's having fun as you can see.

755
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,922
He's got a sunny personality.

756
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:53,467
-What an innocent smile.
-It's a relief he's young.

757
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:58,221
That was great. You need kids
around the house or hospital.

758
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:02,225
I'm going to have lots of kids later on.
A big family.

759
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,647
How long will he be safe?

760
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:09,399
I don't know.

761
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,152
For as long as they're there?

762
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,403
Let's play hide-and-seek.

763
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,197
All right.

764
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,365
Seung-jo, let's go hide.

765
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:23,246
Ready or not, here I come

766
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,498
Ready or not

767
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:27,250
Can you hurry up and take the kid?

768
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:30,587
What? I thought you said
you wanted the kid around.

769
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,130
You didn't hear the rest of it.

770
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,634
We can only handle him for three hours.

771
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:39,012
Try playing hide-and-seek 27 times.

772
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,600
Then where is he?

773
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:45,602
He's sleeping on the chair.

774
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,355
What?

775
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:50,232
What?

776
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,651
Is it the 28th hide-and-seek?

777
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:58,323
Ready or not

778
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:01,201
here I come

779
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:04,746
He's dead once I find him.

780
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:08,708
Maybe, I shouldn't have kids.

781
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:14,965
Where are you, Seung-jo?

782
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:22,180
You're not doing this
just for Dr. Cha's sake.

783
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:26,726
You're also doing it
to satisfy your ambition.

784
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:29,145
Isn't that so?

785
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:38,572
Administrative Director,
I'm pleading with you.

786
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:41,783
Let Seung-tak operate on the boy.

787
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:45,412
We could use Dr. Koh's help
in our surgeries, too.

788
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,330
The boy hasn't even woken up yet.

789
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:50,667
How can you proceed
in those circumstances?

790
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,336
If the boy stays in a coma
after the reoperation, that'll be worse.

791
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,922
Yes, it's a risky operation.

792
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,216
We know you want us to avoid such risks.

793
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,844
None of you highly-paid doctors
can handle the reoperation?

794
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:05,015
If you're not capable of doing it,
then transfer the kid to another hospital.

795
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:06,391
Why that piece of…

796
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:08,018
We can't transfer the boy.

797
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:10,478
There's the matter of his medical bill.

798
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:14,024
His operation is covered
by Dr. Cha's fund. It's a hefty bill.

799
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:16,026
Is the bill that important?

800
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:19,362
Are you unwell?

801
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:25,994
Dr. Cha's fund will only cover
his main operation.

802
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:29,289
This reoperation isn't covered.
It's an unscheduled one.

803
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,750
Dr. Cha has to sign off on it,
but he can’t.

804
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:35,211
What? His signature?

805
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:38,381
Any funds released from Dr. Cha's fund
need my approval.

806
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:42,344
Since Dr. Cha is incapacitated,
the hospital will handle the fund.

807
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:46,473
We were short on funds to renovate
the VIP wing. I think I found a way.

808
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:48,183
This is good.

809
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:57,567
That dirty scoundrel.

810
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,030
Seung-jo.

811
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:04,950
Come back to Mommy.

812
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:07,911
I'm waiting for you to wake up.

813
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:20,882
Mommy.

814
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,469
What? Mommy.

815
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:27,681
Mommy.

816
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:32,143
Mommy? It's me, Seung-jo.

817
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:47,450
Doctor, what's the matter with my mom?

818
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:53,873
Seung-jo.

819
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:59,045
You're going through a hard time, right?

820
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:02,924
Come back to Mommy.

821
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:28,283
Did you mean what you said?
Is it still valid?

822
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:30,118
What? What did I say?

823
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:33,121
That you'd see this to the end
whether I'm a ghost or an alien.

824
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:35,206
What now?

825
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:37,709
Let's do this.

826
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:46,468
We can't transfer the boy
to another hospital.

827
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:48,845
Of course, not.

828
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,347
He can't afford the costs.

829
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:53,641
He needs a reoperation though.

830
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:57,103
Don't just talk about the problem.

831
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:58,688
Make a decision!

832
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,399
What do doctors do?

833
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:03,818
Hippocratic Oath. It's our duty!

834
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,821
We can't let the patient wait
for a doctor.

835
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,074
You're just saving your skin.

836
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:12,494
How can making money override the urge
to save a patient's life?

837
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:15,872
You're real doctors, I see.

838
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:19,876
I knew you wouldn't have an appetite
after abandoning a patient.

839
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:22,170
Especially you, Dr. Ban.

840
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:26,966
When you saved an eight-year-old patient
20 years ago, your heart was into it.

841
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:27,967
What?

842
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:29,385
I did?

843
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:32,097
You had courage back then.

844
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:34,682
And that's how you rose to the top.

845
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:37,519
Yes, that's true.

846
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:39,813
Your position requires you
to make a stand.

847
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:42,273
When a patient's life is at stake,

848
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:44,192
you need to make the right choice.

849
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:56,704
Dr. Koh sent this?

850
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:58,790
He says you shouldn't skip your meals.

851
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:01,835
He's very worried about your health.

852
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,470
What a surprise.

853
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,647
I made a promise to a girl.

854
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:26,401
I would be a heart surgeon,
and she would be a brain surgeon.

855
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:32,282
She wanted to set up a clinic with me
after we started living together.

856
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:45,712
EUNSANG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

857
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:50,425
-How much time do we have?
-It's 15 minutes.

858
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:52,844
-You didn't sleep?
-I drank coffee all night.

859
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:54,846
My heart is pounding.

860
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,764
My hands are trembling.

861
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:58,683
It's the caffeine kicking in.

862
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:00,894
You think I can pull this off?

863
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:04,439
You're the best.

864
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:05,815
Be confident.

865
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,317
Okay. Confidence.

866
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:15,366
How much time do we have?

867
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,243
About ten minutes.

868
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,536
Not Jae-won. You.

869
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:21,122
Around 20 hours.

870
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:22,832
You sound proud saying that.

871
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,626
As a first-year resident,
I'm doing my best.

872
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:26,461
I've never been subservient to anyone.

873
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:27,754
I always called the shots.

874
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:34,093
You're ignoring me. Where are you going?

875
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:56,533
Seung-jo.

876
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:58,993
You know me, right?

877
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:03,873
I'm Dr. Cha Young-min.

878
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:06,376
The top doctor at this hospital.

879
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,587
And who am I caring for?

880
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:12,173
Me.

881
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:14,592
Right.

882
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:18,596
I'll help you meet your mom.

883
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:22,225
So be brave and wait here.

884
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,602
You can do that, right?

885
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:25,853
Yes.

886
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,916
He's paying it forward.

887
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,586
What kind of generational cycle is this?

888
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:58,678
Administrative Director.

889
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,972
What are you doing here on a weekend?

890
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:02,765
Dr. Han and Dr. Kim

891
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:05,602
are brave enough to take
on the young patient's reoperation.

892
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:08,062
-So I came to support them.
-They don't need any support.

893
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,230
It'll only spoil them.

894
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:11,733
-Which unit is it?
-Which one? I'm not sure.

895
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:13,568
I don't think it's been chosen yet.

896
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:28,625
As you can see the operation
is going smoothly.

897
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:31,544
But it's a very delicate one.

898
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,546
I can't add any pressure to the doctors

899
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,590
when they're handling
a delicate operation.

900
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:37,050
Of course, not. Let's leave now.

901
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:44,891
Five, four, three, two, one.

902
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,101
I'll head home now.

903
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:11,918
Seung-tak.

904
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:15,463
What are you doing there?

905
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:17,507
I came to perform an operation.

906
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:20,927
What are you doing there? To observe?

907
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:23,346
Dr. Ban.

908
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:25,181
Well, actually…

909
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:29,602
Dr. Kim stayed up all night
looking after a patient.

910
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,896
So he exceeded the 80-hour work limit
by eight hours.

911
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:34,565
He worked 88 hours in total.

912
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:35,608
Dr. Han.

913
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:42,156
I called the other residents,
but they all reached their workhour limit.

914
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:46,285
Dr. Koh is the only resident
who has time left.

915
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:51,708
Thanks to someone,

916
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:54,168
I had a lot of free time this week.
I think I have 20 hours left.

917
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:56,838
Ten minutes have already passed.

918
01:01:57,922 --> 01:02:01,092
If we exceed the work hours,
the fine is 5,000,000 won, I think.

919
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:02,760
We got fined before, I heard.

920
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:05,763
You can't overwork residents anymore.

921
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:10,059
That's why we have to avoid the fine.

922
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:11,853
We could also be penalized
for how many residents we can hire.

923
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:15,064
We don't have enough residents as it is.
So we had no choice.

924
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:20,486
Shall we begin, Dr. Han?

925
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:21,946
Okay, shall we?

926
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,052
Dr. Cha.

927
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:55,313
PSYCHIATRIST LEE MIN-SOOK

928
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,320
You called me yesterday?

929
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:06,574
I'm Jang Se-jin.
Thank you for making time for me.

930
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:11,746
Suction.

931
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:12,997
Suction.

932
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,540
Give me the forceps and bovie.

933
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:30,640
What? Not there.

934
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:36,687
I'm sorry.

935
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:37,772
Suction.

936
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:44,487
Army navy retractor.

937
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:45,738
Army navy retractor.

938
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:53,579
What's happening to him?

939
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:57,917
I wonder why. This never happened before.

940
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:01,712
What's the matter, Seung-tak?

941
01:04:14,892 --> 01:04:16,561
Hand me another one.

942
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:30,843
Did something happen
in the operating unit?

943
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,470
You need to take care of your body.

944
01:05:32,553 --> 01:05:35,264
You brag about your skills
when someone else did all the work.

945
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:36,474
Take this time to rest.

946
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:39,060
You may ruin the lives of people
who are alive.

947
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:42,229
So unless you must check on him,
I'd like you to limit your visits.

948
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:43,856
Is there something off?

949
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,317
-I'm going to die, right?
-Why do you think

950
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,028
what happened to him
could never happen to you?

951
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:52,531
It's either one of two things.
Either they woke up or they died.

952
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:55,493
It was actually Dr. Cha.

953
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:03,960
