1
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,576
I'm heading home.

2
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,578
Do you have a date tonight?

3
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,539
Yes, I am.

4
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,416
-See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

5
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:46,880
Damn it.

6
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,676
This patient's aortic aneurysm
has ruptured.

7
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,179
I told you we don't have
any doctors available to perform surgery.

8
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,973
How could you bring him here
when I told you that?

9
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,726
His vitals are barely steady.
He's in hypovolemic shock.

10
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,728
He'll die if he doesn't get surgery
right now.

11
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:04,147
We can't operate on him.
Hurry up and leave.

12
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,525
I've thought about that day
a million times.

13
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,070
If I had made a different choice…

14
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,408
she might not have left me.

15
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,538
If I hadn't intervened that day,

16
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,627
would I be a different doctor today?

17
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,629
Stop!

18
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,510
This is a hospital and we're doctors.

19
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,303
If we give up on our patients,
who will treat them?

20
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,680
So you think you're a doctor, too?

21
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,767
Will you operate on this patient yourself?

22
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,020
If I had let them pass,

23
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:46,773
would I have had a more comfortable life?

24
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,610
No, Dad!

25
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,328
Would that happen to me, too?

26
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:04,707
Would this choice
change the course of my life?

27
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,459
But I can't help it.

28
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,670
I can't let the patient go.

29
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,047
I don't think I can let go.

30
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,341
That's how I felt, too.

31
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,638
I couldn't let go of the patient.

32
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,810
I remember up until that moment.

33
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,563
Page Dr. Min.

34
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:30,066
I'll try my best
to keep the patient alive. This way.

35
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,609
Hurry.

36
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,158
Hey, Seung-tak.
What do you think you're doing?

37
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,828
You're going to turn away a dying patient?

38
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,164
I can't allow that at my hospital.

39
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:47,834
This patient has an aortic aneurysm.
How can you operate on that, Dr. Koh?

40
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,461
What do we need to do?

41
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,467
He's losing a lot of blood.

42
00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:00,513
By the time Dr. Min gets here,
he'll be dead.

43
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,974
I don't remember what happened next.

44
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,602
Like blacking out
after having too much to drink.

45
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,854
We will begin the surgery.

46
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,439
Gauze.

47
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,816
That's exactly what happened to me.

48
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,694
I was always the crazy one
in the operating room.

49
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,029
What?

50
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:19,365
I thought Dr. Ban was the lead surgeon.
It says here, it's Dr. Ban.

51
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,451
He'll be here soon.

52
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,705
I'll need your help.

53
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,290
Brace yourself.

54
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,459
What? Okay.

55
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,128
Let's keep the patient alive
until Dr. Ban gets here.

56
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,922
My memory always goes blank.

57
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,216
As if I woke up after a deep slumber.

58
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,637
Are you crazy? Step away from the patient!

59
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,308
The fatality rate is over 50%
for an aortic aneurysm.

60
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,061
The rate increases by 1%
for every hour delayed.

61
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,396
The large intestine
might've stopped functioning already.

62
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,815
If we don't do anything now,
no surgery can save him later.

63
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,235
Suction.

64
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,243
Suction.

65
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,496
Jae-won! Suction!

66
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,872
Yes, suction.

67
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,587
We're in operating unit eight.
We need a doctor now. Anyone.

68
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,547
-Suction.
-We're overwhelmed!

69
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,676
Call an intern
or even a med school student.

70
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,553
Gauze.

71
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,265
Retractor.

72
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,187
Suction.

73
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,064
Deeper.

74
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,194
I found it. Vascular clamp.

75
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,536
He's stabilized.

76
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,579
His blood pressure is returning to normal.

77
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,919
You punk! What do you think you're doing?

78
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,381
Put on a surgical gown and help me.

79
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,938
Hold that.

80
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,982
Do it right!

81
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,066
His blood pressure is falling again!

82
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,319
Wait a minute.

83
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,279
Don't touch the vascular clamp.
Be very careful.

84
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,281
Okay.

85
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,337
Be careful around the vascular clamp.

86
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,297
Don't touch it.

87
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,825
I think we stabilized him.

88
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,368
He'll survive.

89
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,995
The patient will make it.

90
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,042
The patient is alive.

91
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,170
You crazy bastard.

92
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,383
Suddenly, I sobered up.

93
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,302
I looked around

94
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,805
and realized I had done something insane.

95
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,400
Dr. Min!

96
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,694
What? What's going on?

97
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,447
This intern saved the patient's life.

98
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:53,788
I…

99
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,874
was stricken with fear.

100
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,377
Weren't you scared too?

101
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,094
I succeeded again?

102
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,097
I'm on a roll. Why am I so good?

103
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,392
You're crazy.

104
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:18,438
I got a taste of how it felt.

105
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,441
I guess this is why people become doctors.

106
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,695
Andwe saved the patient.

107
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,699
Seung-tak was eight
when it happened, right?

108
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,034
I thought it was just a phase.

109
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,455
It seems like he never stopped.

110
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,458
Or did it come back to him recently?

111
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,042
What on earth

112
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,628
are you talking about?

113
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,215
You know what I'm talking about.

114
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,848
Yes, I can see you.

115
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,400
I thought he wasn't well
because of his accident.

116
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,111
After he started working here,

117
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,739
he's been talking in a strange manner.

118
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,910
I wasn't the only one who noticed it.

119
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,509
I asked a friend who had studied
in America to look into this.

120
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:34,013
He told me something interesting
about Seung-tak.

121
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:38,518
Seung-tak wasn't skipping classes
in America to slack off.

122
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,686
He had sought out doctors.

123
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,813
Mostly psychiatrists and neurologists.

124
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,276
He must've been trying to find a cure

125
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,029
by scouring the country.

126
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,657
Looks like you didn't know that.

127
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,867
Which means grandfather doesn't know, too.

128
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,285
Seung-won.

129
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,042
I feel so bad for my cousin.

130
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,299
Seung-tak has been trying so hard
to meet Grandpa's expectations.

131
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:15,429
But he's working at a hospital
where people's lives are at stake.

132
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,183
What's more worrisome…

133
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,813
is the fact that he's a doctor.

134
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,931
LEE SUN-HO

135
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:05,187
What was that? Seung-tak did what now?

136
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,565
He saved an ER patient
who had an aortic aneurysm.

137
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,569
We had no surgeons available,
so we were turning away the patient.

138
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,155
But Seung-tak overruled that
and took away the patient.

139
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,282
He put down Dr. Ban
in the operating schedule.

140
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,534
He told Jae-won to do it.
He stood as his first assistant.

141
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,624
Right after finishing
Lee Ji-woo's surgery, he did another one.

142
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,292
This isn't an easy operation.

143
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,585
He keeps surprising us.

144
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,129
There really must be something about him.

145
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:38,971
What's the matter?

146
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,890
What?

147
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,559
It's nothing.

148
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,980
Where's Seung-tak?

149
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,732
Where is he?

150
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,611
So…

151
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:58,324
you're telling me it happened to you, too?

152
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,453
And now you're doing the same thing to me?

153
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,666
This is like a cycle of abuse.

154
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,250
Do you have to put it like that?

155
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:13,506
You were always able to see ghosts,
so this probably wasn't a big shock.

156
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:19,345
You're not going to ask me
how I became a top surgeon after that?

157
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:22,181
What's the point?
I'm not going to follow in your footsteps.

158
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:27,686
I am curious about
how you became such a mean doctor.

159
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,190
Do you know

160
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,651
who possessed your body then?

161
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,945
I have no idea.
I can't see ghosts like you can.

162
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:40,908
He must've been an excellent doctor.
Like me.

163
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,285
You were lucky.

164
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,038
If he was the Jade Emperor or a baby
shaman, you'd have been in trouble.

165
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,456
Yes, I was very lucky.

166
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,876
If the ghost had been
an armchair expert like you…

167
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,545
Did it

168
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,672
only happen once?

169
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,049
Or several times?

170
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,926
A few more times when I was a resident.

171
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:03,305
With ER patients like you had today

172
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,599
who were being turned away.

173
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,355
Ji-woo was one of them.

174
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:15,151
Her parents didn't realize
she was in a critical state.

175
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,571
They brought her to the hospital
only after she lost consciousness.

176
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,617
Hi, there.

177
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,454
Open your hand.

178
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,165
This is a magic candy.

179
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,584
If you hold it in your hand,
your pain will go away.

180
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,338
I made a promise to her.

181
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:42,553
When she was to come back
for a reoperation ten years later,

182
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,555
that I'd be the one to do it.

183
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:46,390
I didn't think

184
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,559
she'd remember.

185
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,771
You have to keep your promise.
How irresponsible.

186
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,566
I barely kept my promise
because you came late.

187
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,109
Why are you blaming me for that?

188
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:00,237
It's you who stopped
in the middle of your surgery that day.

189
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,864
-What?
-You said it yourself.

190
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,824
It wasn't a big shock when I got possessed

191
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,951
because I can see ghosts.

192
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,036
Then you…

193
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,622
You entered my body
so why didn't you complete the surgery?

194
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,749
If you had possessed me,

195
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,542
you should've saved your body
no matter what.

196
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,212
Why did you stop in the middle of it?

197
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,923
What could I do?

198
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,217
Is that why…

199
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,511
I'm glad you didn't die
and I'm grateful for that.

200
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,223
But if you keep entering my body,

201
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,433
you said you'd die.

202
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,229
I might not be able to save lives,

203
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,649
but I don't want to let anyone die.

204
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,818
So let's avoid each other.

205
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,114
Keep a two-meter distance from me.

206
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,868
You seem to have forgotten.

207
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,789
You're the one
who took on that ER patient.

208
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,003
And you gave me the sign
to enter your body.

209
00:13:58,879 --> 00:13:59,713
It was you

210
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,466
who saved his life.

211
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,305
I'm glad it went well.

212
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,517
You're the one
who took on that ER patient.

213
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:13,561
It was you

214
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,312
who saved his life.

215
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,856
I was the same at first.

216
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,526
All I wanted to do was just run away.

217
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,821
Because I was scared and frightened.

218
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,156
But do you know

219
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,326
why I didn't?

220
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,053
Because the patient survived.

221
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,056
I may have not been the one to save them,

222
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,143
but the ghost used my body to save him.

223
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,353
So I helped in a way.

224
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,275
That's probably how you felt, too.

225
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,777
When you held the scalpel

226
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,739
and were operating on me.

227
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,035
I entered your body

228
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,664
and thanks to that, I'm still alive.

229
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,000
You're right.

230
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:24,798
I might never wake up from my coma
like you said if we keep going.

231
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:28,761
Even if I hadn't possessed you,
the result would be the same.

232
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,888
I told you that I'm a doctor.

233
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,599
You bought me some time.

234
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,560
And I don't have

235
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,729
much time left.

236
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,858
I want to do what needs to be done…

237
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,737
instead of just waiting to die.

238
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,073
And I need your help.

239
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:54,828
If you turn me down…

240
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:58,374
I won't possess you.

241
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,586
It's your body.

242
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,314
Crystal, not now.

243
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,732
So the operation was a success.

244
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:27,236
Shouldn't I get an award
instead of a slap?

245
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,656
Is that so? Come with me.
I'll give you an award.

246
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,991
Really?

247
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,034
What kind of award?

248
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,329
Will you treat me to dinner?
Is it an expensive award?

249
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,209
What are you doing?

250
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,503
I'm rewarding you.

251
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:47,131
This is a reward to support your goal
of being a heart surgeon.

252
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,550
Come on, do as I do.

253
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,970
Not squats again.

254
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,181
Do heart surgeons use their legs
to operate on patients?

255
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,936
Why do you look sour all the time?
You should leave that teen angst behind.

256
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,356
What is it? Something troubling you?

257
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,191
Don't ask.

258
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,819
Guess I'm undergoing an identity crisis.

259
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:13,991
For someone
who's always cool under pressure,

260
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,534
I think this is heavy stuff.

261
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,369
I wonder what it is.

262
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:21,999
And you?

263
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,169
Are you becoming a heart surgeon
against your mom's wishes?

264
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:28,589
I'm going to become a surgeon like you
against her wishes.

265
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:30,966
What?

266
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,888
You saved that ER patient just now.

267
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,976
Do you know how many patients
you've saved?

268
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,815
Don't you want to save a life
with your own hands

269
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,693
instead of just helping out?

270
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,405
What are you saying?

271
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,452
I'd like to save a life, too.

272
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,872
That means I have to push myself harder.
Gosh, my legs.

273
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,041
Don't overdo it.

274
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,543
Don't put your life at risk
in order to save others' lives.

275
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,671
It isn't worth it.
Risking your life like that is reckless.

276
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,218
It's not like
people have nine lives like cats.

277
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,428
Why risk your life for that?

278
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,319
You had a long day. Get some rest.

279
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,373
At this rate,

280
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,126
you're really going to die.

281
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,672
I'm so grateful.

282
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,633
Thank you so much.

283
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,260
Is he inside?

284
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,059
Brother.

285
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,228
Brother.

286
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:21,910
He woke up.

287
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,457
I knew it.

288
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,043
I knew you'd succeed.

289
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,446
Great job.

290
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,855
You need to protect your son.

291
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,150
He means everything to you.

292
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,870
Seung-tak successfully did
two operations today.

293
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,164
They were both complex surgeries.

294
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,001
Complex surgeries?

295
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,220
EUNSANG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

296
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,689
Did something go wrong with his surgery?

297
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,107
What?

298
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,608
No, it went fine.

299
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,069
The operation was a success
and he's recovering nicely.

300
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,320
I see.

301
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,781
I haven't thanked the surgeon yet.

302
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,451
Who operated on my husband?

303
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,581
It was me.

304
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,584
Officially, I'm the lead surgeon.
My name is Dr. Ban Tae-shik.

305
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,129
Yes, sure. You were
the lead surgeon, Doctor.

306
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:40,090
I'm in eternal debt to you, Doctor.

307
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,634
Thank you so much.

308
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,637
I took the Hippocratic Oath. It's my job.

309
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,473
Your husband's operation was difficult.

310
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,560
-And it will get harder now.
-Why isn't he here yet?

311
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,243
You're late.

312
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,540
Why are you in the lobby?

313
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,042
I was waiting for you.

314
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,835
How do you feel? All right?

315
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:19,171
You're concerned about my health? No way.

316
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:22,341
You did two operations in one day
yesterday. With your weak body.

317
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,009
Do some squats.

318
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,682
What are you doing?

319
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,351
I'm being careful.
Because you call the shots.

320
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,147
Just be like you always were.

321
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,149
But make sure you follow our terms.

322
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:45,238
Look at the time! You're super late!
Follow me. Dr. Jang is probably waiting.

323
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,953
What's this? He's calling the shots again.

324
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:56,374
Don't forget our terms. You report to me.

325
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,252
You're recovering very quickly
since you're young.

326
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,880
We'll have to keep monitoring you,

327
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,882
but I think you'll be able
to begin rehabilitation soon.

328
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,010
Thank you. Thank you, Doctor.

329
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,814
Welcome back to the real world.
You know who I am, right?

330
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:20,232
Who are you?

331
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,363
Take a close look.
I've got distinct features.

332
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,989
You'll recognize me.

333
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,827
I've never seen you before.

334
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,078
He's lying.

335
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,413
What? Why are you acting like
you don't know?

336
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,918
Jung-hee, about the bill…

337
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,295
You don't have to worry about that.

338
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,047
It's all been covered.

339
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,258
But who?

340
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,223
Don't worry about the hospital bill.

341
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:56,226
We already talked to the police too,

342
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:59,271
so relax and just focus on getting better.

343
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,942
You're young so you'll recover fast.

344
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:10,907
Sure. Okay.

345
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,412
What did he say?
He'll pay you off if you stay quiet?

346
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:16,705
You know the truth.

347
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:17,873
They were the ones

348
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:21,042
who ignored you while you were out.
We're the ones who saved you.

349
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,129
Hey, Seung-tak. Seung-tak!

350
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:31,803
Doctor, what happened to the driver
of the car I crashed into?

351
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,270
Hi Seung-tak.
What brings you here so early?

352
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:44,733
What now?

353
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,736
I came to give some friendly advice.

354
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,238
Don't cross the line anymore.

355
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,491
You're talking nonsense now.

356
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,243
You should be careful about that.

357
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,828
You've been very irritating.

358
00:24:56,912 --> 00:25:01,416
I'm trying my best not to cross the line
because someone keeps pushing my buttons.

359
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:04,628
It's causing an identity crisis
even though I'm not a teenager.

360
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:07,255
Don't push my buttons.

361
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,798
Nothing good will come out of it.

362
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,177
-Let me warn you--
-It's me who's warning you.

363
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:14,596
So don't you forget it.

364
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:24,606
Seung-tak…

365
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:43,750
After the accident, you were both
brought here and received surgery.

366
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,710
The driver you hit

367
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,545
is in a coma as you can see.

368
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,174
Will he wake up?

369
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,010
If the Heavens help him.

370
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,684
You need to rest and avoid stress,

371
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,353
so I don't know if I should ask this.

372
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:07,315
Is there anything you have to tell us
about the accident?

373
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:10,568
No.

374
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,822
It was a freak accident.

375
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,168
You piece of…

376
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,629
How could you lie?

377
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,266
I'm going to buy a soft drink.
Just wait here.

378
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:55,530
He's not lying.
He can't remember anything.

379
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,574
Do people remember their previous lives?

380
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:58,825
No, they don't.

381
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,037
It's similar to that.

382
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:06,458
And it's better that he doesn't remember.

383
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:09,544
If he were to remember talking to ghosts,

384
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,880
that would drive him mad.

385
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,048
It would be unbearable.

386
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,801
Is this Heaven's will, too?

387
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:30,023
The living and ghosts like us
can't remember stuff like this.

388
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:32,025
It's how the world works. A natural cycle.

389
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,905
What? Is there a precious memory you lost?

390
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:38,782
What?

391
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,950
No, not at all.

392
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:44,454
You have nothing to worry about
based on your actions.

393
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,915
You're either not going to wake up

394
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:47,999
or die.

395
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:50,668
See you around.

396
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,687
If he doesn’t remember a thing,
I'll tell him.

397
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,064
It's not hard.

398
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:31,835
You took cold medicine that day, right?
And you were drowsy.

399
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,087
What?

400
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,589
You didn't intend to crash like that.

401
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,426
You were supposed to delay him
by bumping into his car.

402
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:45,390
You wake up and find
that it was much worse. It's confusing.

403
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,892
How do you know all that?

404
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,687
Heard of cognitive dissonance?

405
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,315
It's mental discomfort that results from
holding two conflicting beliefs.

406
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,069
I know a little bit about that.

407
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,029
Just be yourself.

408
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:01,156
If you fight it,

409
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,324
it's stressful.

410
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:08,705
Let's have a drink.

411
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,708
Where did the soju go?

412
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:14,669
Why do they always disappear
when I put them here?

413
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,881
People and ghosts

414
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,216
never follow the rules.

415
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,720
They're not supposed to drink.

416
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:26,222
Why can't they follow that simple rule?

417
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,267
Why are they shortening their lives?

418
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,229
People never stop littering.

419
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,403
Get your hands off of that.

420
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,201
I told you to stop!

421
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,706
People and ghosts are the same.

422
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,377
Well, sometimes a drink
is better than medicine.

423
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:04,219
Once you smell this,
you can never forget it.

424
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:08,014
This soju is on a different level
from alcohol in the ghost world. Here.

425
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,768
-What a pity. It's nicer with beer.
-I know.

426
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,102
Can I…

427
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:15,980
have a drink, too?

428
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,038
Oh, gosh.

429
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,541
Do ghosts get drunk?

430
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,627
We haven't got enough soju to get drunk.

431
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,796
It's not often
that we get our hands on any.

432
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,925
-That was nice.
-Sure. It's a nice drink.

433
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,302
All right. Pour me a drink.

434
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:48,012
Excuse me.

435
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:53,768
Could you let me have one bottle?

436
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,323
Sir. You were looking for me I heard.

437
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:09,659
What are you doing outside?

438
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:13,121
I'm getting tired of playing Go.
Thought I'd get some air.

439
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:18,126
It's nice to be out here
and see the scenery.

440
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:26,009
The world is so beautiful.

441
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,388
Why are you standing? Sit with me.

442
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:31,973
Okay.

443
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,225
Do you drink?

444
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,645
Yes, I usually drink wine.

445
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,692
Soju is the best drink there is.

446
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:44,903
I'm…

447
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,197
pouring you this drink out of gratitude.

448
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,078
Thank you for the operation, Doctor.

449
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,580
Drink it.

450
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:03,504
And I'm pouring you this to apologize.

451
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:12,347
Because of me,
your bright career got derailed.

452
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,223
Drink it.

453
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,190
And…

454
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:27,153
this drink is another apology
for splitting you two.

455
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,370
After Se-jin went to America,

456
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,830
she had a tough time.

457
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:42,001
She refused any help from me
and tried to fend for herself.

458
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:47,882
When I visited her once,
she said this to me.

459
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:53,471
She left someone very precious
before coming to America

460
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,140
and she couldn't be happy after that.

461
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,602
She said she would live
with that guilt forever.

462
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:04,273
The day you saw Se-jin in my room,

463
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,110
-I realized.
-This is my youngest daughter.

464
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:10,530
You were the one that got away.

465
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:16,160
I was very disappointed.

466
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,873
Come on.

467
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,668
Drink up.

468
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,718
You're pouting?

469
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:36,055
No wonder my daughter left
without telling you her true feelings.

470
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:43,104
Her mom suddenly passed away,

471
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,607
and she was labeled an illegitimate child.

472
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:52,447
Her half-brother hated her
from the beginning.

473
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,628
I don't think I can…

474
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,340
be of any help to you.

475
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,177
Just like then.

476
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,096
And even now.

477
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,600
I'm sorry.

478
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,603
Sorry, Young-min.

479
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:40,870
Why didn't she muster the courage
to tell you before she left?

480
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,021
Se-jin…

481
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,534
The number you have dialed…

482
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:23,538
Just a little longer…

483
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,793
Why didn't you wait a little longer?

484
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,307
Are you crying?

485
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,643
No, I'm not. Who's crying?

486
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,396
It's obvious you were. Your eyes are red.

487
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,566
Something got in my eye, that's all.
What is it?

488
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,277
I've got good news.

489
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,154
-The motorcyclists…
-Hey, bad news.

490
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,824
What motorcyclist?

491
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,786
Which do you want to hear first?
Good or bad?

492
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,830
The bad news.

493
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,332
The chairman said no.

494
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,500
-What?
-What?

495
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,795
Then I'll hear the good news first.

496
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:15,339
Time-out.

497
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,514
That's absurd.

498
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,850
Why does he not want her to know?

499
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,268
Because he's her dad.

500
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,396
Pour me a drink, too.

501
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:35,526
Let's call this a drink to cheer us up.

502
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,362
-What?
-You've seen my son.

503
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:42,325
I've failed as a father.

504
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,165
Why is this so bitter?

505
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,460
My life is bitter and so is this drink.

506
00:36:55,379 --> 00:37:01,802
He was my only son and he's spoiled.
But I never trusted him.

507
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:08,893
It's natural I had a son like that.
I'm a failure as a dad.

508
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,940
I don't have the right
to ask you for this.

509
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:16,484
But could you

510
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:20,738
have some pity for me?

511
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,242
Let me cover…

512
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,872
for my son's sins.

513
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,171
So…

514
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:40,967
he doesn't want his son to be
charged with attempted parricide?

515
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:44,887
Because parents will defend their kids
even if they're murderers.

516
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,098
That's when it's
just their parents they killed.

517
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,267
But they put you in a coma.

518
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,393
Are you

519
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,187
as angry as I am?

520
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,941
The chairman thought hard about it.

521
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:59,193
He knows his son more than anyone else.

522
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,320
He's trying to protect Se-jin.

523
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,447
So that he won't go after her, too.

524
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:08,035
And the rest is my burden
to take care of in due time.

525
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,080
Let's take care
of the pressing matter first.

526
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:17,753
He's here.

527
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,046
-There he is.
-Over there.

528
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:23,592
Is it true that Chairman Jang
has not woken up from his coma?

529
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,136
Was the operation unsuccessful?

530
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,096
Is it a case of malpractice?

531
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:29,348
Did you lie to the public?

532
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,434
-Why did you do that?
-Could you comment?

533
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:35,521
What is this?

534
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,653
CHAIRMAN JANG IN COMA.
HAS HIS SON LIED TO THE PUBLIC?

535
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,615
Then it was uncheckable like he said.

536
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,581
CHAIRMAN JANG IN COMA.
HAS HIS SON LIED TO THE PUBLIC?

537
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:05,426
ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR HAN SEUNG-WON

538
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:20,024
Who leaked this to the press?

539
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:24,028
Keep the press away.
Can't you see the reporters outside?

540
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:26,113
-Good morning, sir!
-Good morning, sir!

541
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,324
Enough!

542
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:29,533
Yes.

543
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,163
What about the board?

544
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:37,041
Keep the board under control
until I get there.

545
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:45,633
What's this?

546
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,969
What are you doing here?

547
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:53,182
Dad, you look gaunter today.

548
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,059
It's upsetting.

549
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,520
Since when have you been…

550
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,402
You leaked this.
You told the press, right?

551
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,494
Do you want to know if I did it?
First, tell me what you did.

552
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,914
-What?
-You probably didn’t do it alone.

553
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,753
Great timing.

554
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,886
What's going on?

555
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,596
Why did the chairman's condition
suddenly change?

556
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:39,812
And the last member.

557
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,691
Looks like everyone is here.

558
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,243
An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth.

559
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,412
I told you this would work.

560
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,307
Dad's lawyer?

561
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:20,895
Sir.

562
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:22,938
I came a bit too late.

563
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:24,607
I'm sorry.

564
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:44,084
This is my punishment for my son.

565
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,801
For him, it will be worse

566
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:57,014
than being sentenced to jail.

567
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,606
This is…

568
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,317
the chairman's final will.

569
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,864
In case he ends up in an accident,

570
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:17,368
it can only be read in front of his family
when they are all gathered together.

571
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:22,706
And this…

572
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,627
is his order to not use life support.

573
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:32,216
I think everyone here
knows what this means.

574
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,388
What is it?

575
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,723
Do not… what?

576
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:40,724
What?

577
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:42,351
What is it?

578
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,146
What's the meaning of this?

579
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,752
I did as you told me, Dr. Koh.

580
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:11,505
But I still don't get it.

581
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,800
This isn't a malpractice case.
It's a crime with malicious intent.

582
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,760
Is there a reason

583
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:18,929
why you're doing this?

584
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:22,182
There are reasons
why people can't rest in peace.

585
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,686
It's when they have somebody to protect,

586
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,314
when they are infuriated
over a perceived injustice,

587
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:31,775
or when there's something they were

588
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:34,278
very fond of before dying.

589
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,698
I guess there are many reasons.

590
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,575
What are you talking about?

591
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,619
Could you…

592
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:46,040
just trust this plan for now?

593
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,960
Believe in Dr. Cha, not me.

594
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:54,882
Let's leave it to him
to take care of that when he wakes up.

595
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:56,800
For now,

596
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,803
let's allow the chairman to rest in peace.

597
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,474
Let's take care
of the pressing matter first.

598
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,225
Will Dr. Jang

599
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,394
follow your plan?

600
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:10,397
She will. Because she's a doctor

601
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,483
and daughter.

602
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:15,861
How can I do that myself?

603
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:21,450
I can't do it.

604
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,994
Can you trust anyone else to?

605
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:31,293
His people told me
that the chairman woke up from his coma.

606
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,629
We'll have to conduct an investigation
to learn the truth.

607
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:35,631
His physician might have made an error.

608
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:38,509
So you didn't know anything about this?

609
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,970
It's an oversight. I should've checked
on the chairman myself.

610
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,847
You weren't involved in the cover-up?

611
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,141
What are you inferring?

612
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:48,644
Come on.

613
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,023
You know what I'm talking about.

614
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:57,152
-Now, Director.
-Seung-won.

615
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:01,281
Whatever you were planning to do,

616
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,991
it stops now.

617
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,536
If you take this any further,

618
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:08,664
you'll secure your own downfall.
So keep that in mind.

619
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:17,840
Resolve the matter

620
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,843
solely based on science
and medical knowledge.

621
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:25,055
This is a hospital where we save lives.

622
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:27,224
And you happen to be

623
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,560
the administrative director, right?

624
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:34,857
How could you allow this to happen?

625
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:38,902
I'm sorry.

626
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,071
Did you think you could hide what you did?

627
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,323
After committing a medical error?

628
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:45,993
What?

629
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:50,205
You're the reason why people hate doctors.

630
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:53,917
If you made an error, you should
admit it and take responsibility.

631
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:57,671
We keep getting hit
by lawsuits because of constant cover-ups.

632
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:00,924
Is that okay?

633
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:04,970
-But…
-Fortunately, his son won't press charges.

634
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:08,348
And the hospital is not going
to report you to the authorities.

635
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,017
So…

636
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,769
let's have you leave the hospital.

637
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:15,606
Mr. Han!

638
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:19,401
If you find this unfair,
we can both turn ourselves to the police.

639
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:28,702
Wait a minute.

640
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,375
You helped with that, right?

641
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:38,629
Having me transferred to a hospital
near my home for rehabilitation?

642
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:39,796
Thank you.

643
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,590
It wasn't my idea,

644
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,425
but I'll relay the message.

645
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,511
I'll keep my promise…

646
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:48,805
to make up for what I did.

647
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,557
Focus on getting better for now.

648
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,810
Dr. Cha will decide
what to do if he wakes up.

649
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,896
He'll determine the price you need to pay.

650
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,107
Please wake up from your coma, Dr. Cha.

651
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:01,818
I'll pray for you.

652
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:04,196
Let's go.

653
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:11,787
What have you been
doing here all this time?

654
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,041
Just…

655
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:18,752
standing here.

656
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:21,964
-I don't have much to do anyway.
-What is it?

657
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:25,425
You're afraid
I might jump off the building?

658
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,678
That's not possible.

659
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:45,445
We're taking you for some tests.

660
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:47,197
I…

661
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,575
will oversee it.

662
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,964
You have something to do now.

663
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,634
I'll be alright.

664
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,720
So stay by her side.

665
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:13,890
This will be hard on her.

666
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,486
If you're bored,

667
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:29,448
how about we play a game of Go?

668
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:33,910
Let me get one thing straight.

669
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:39,249
Why are you acting like my senior?
You look younger than me.

670
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,543
I may look young

671
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:44,421
but I've been a ghost for 20 years.

672
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:47,883
I'm much older than you.

673
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:50,052
Is that so?

674
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:54,431
I'm sorry for being disrespectful.

675
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:55,432
Sir!

676
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:59,144
Then please go first.

677
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:02,022
Shall we play?

678
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,363
Let's see.

679
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,126
The pressure in his cranium is high.

680
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:26,171
The contrast agent
won't make it up to his head.

681
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,008
I see pseudo-SAH.

682
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:32,344
AN INCREASED ATTENUATION WITHIN
THE BASAL CISTERNS

683
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:42,229
You're taking it too seriously.

684
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,648
Do you really want to be like that
all your life?

685
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:49,236
I've never lost in anything
I've competed in my life.

686
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:04,418
There aren't…

687
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,337
any signs of brainwaves…

688
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:14,177
that indicate brain activity.

689
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,809
Let me see.

690
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:24,479
You're taking all day, sir!

691
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:27,357
Come on. Don't pressure me.

692
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:30,777
I don't have much time left in this world.

693
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:37,784
Why are you pressuring me? Gosh.

694
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,460
Don't pressure me.

695
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,748
Test results for non-breathing.

696
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,461
No signs…

697
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:33,548
of self-respiration.

698
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:42,599
Why didn't you ever take the time
to learn to play Go?

699
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:44,351
So what is Go?

700
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:46,394
It's a hobby. A pastime.

701
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,188
Why rack your brain over a hobby?

702
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:51,942
In my day, everyone played Alkkagi.

703
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:55,195
And it's all in the wrist.

704
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,030
You can exercise your finger muscles.

705
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:59,282
It's very good exercise.

706
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:06,373
You sure talk a lot.

707
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,482
I'm sorry.

708
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,236
I'm so sorry.

709
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,698
I'm sorry.

710
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:51,835
Gosh. Go easy on me.

711
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:53,628
You want to win?

712
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:56,673
This is the last game I'll ever play.

713
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:07,601
There's no winning and losing
when you're having fun.

714
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,520
That's how life is too.

715
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,690
A good life…

716
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,110
is when you neither win nor lose.

717
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:19,988
Mr. Jang.

718
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:22,949
Rest in peace.

719
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,172
LATE JANG GWANG-DEOK

720
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:09,746
I felt like Dr. Cha would want
to pay his respects, too.

721
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:51,538
Did you say your goodbyes?

722
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:53,665
Yes, thanks to you.

723
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,292
Not the funeral. I meant my car.

724
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:59,796
Yes, I parked it in the hospital lot.

725
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:01,214
Was it parked illegally?

726
00:55:01,297 --> 00:55:02,632
It wasn't.

727
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,301
How is my baby doing?

728
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:08,304
He's a survivor.

729
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:09,764
Bring him to me before I get mad.

730
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:11,725
Pay me back first.

731
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:14,894
You're a prick.
Why did I get stuck with you?

732
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,730
If you don't like it,
then pick a good doctor to possess.

733
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:22,152
Are you going to give up?

734
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,321
I think we've done all we have to.

735
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:27,907
All we have to?

736
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:31,286
Is there anything else to do?

737
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,163
Tell me.

738
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:35,331
What's the point of resting?

739
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:36,666
I've got a lot of time.

740
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:39,169
You don't seem to know much about ghosts.

741
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:42,005
We've got nothing but time
so we're always loitering around.

742
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:53,892
Speaking of which…

743
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:57,145
EUNSANG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

744
00:55:58,313 --> 00:55:59,522
I'll take the patient.

745
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:02,817
What? You will?

746
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:05,695
I've done open-heart surgery,
so I'd like to try lung surgery.

747
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:09,115
Because to become a specialist,
I need to try different cases.

748
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,116
Really?

749
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:13,244
Sometimes, you need to follow the trend.

750
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:16,414
I'll take on this CABG procedure.

751
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:19,417
-You'll do it?
-I have to take on new challenges.

752
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,544
I can't develop my skills
by just doing one procedure well.

753
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,171
When shall we schedule it?

754
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:24,255
Monday!

755
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:27,258
Hold on.
I also have a few operations for you.

756
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:30,595
We could make a great team
if we do this together.

757
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:32,597
If possible,
participate in all of my operations.

758
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,574
Am I your avatar?

759
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:53,576
No, you're just Seung-tak.

760
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:54,744
Come on! Hurry up!

761
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:59,249
All these surgeries
are going to wear out my body.

762
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:03,294
Do you have amnesia?
I call the shots here!

763
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,840
Gloves.

764
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:09,134
Seung-tak?

765
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,471
Intern, pull out the knife slowly.

766
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:14,889
What?

767
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:17,016
Yes, Doctor. I mean, okay.

768
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:19,727
Slowly.

769
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,443
Retractor.

770
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:33,450
More solution.

771
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:35,160
I see bleeding in his artery.
Let's stop that first.

772
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:49,215
He finished a string of successful
operations.

773
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:53,094
At first, the staff was in disbelief
and said he seemed possessed.

774
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:55,013
Now they accept his skills
without any questions.

775
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:57,599
They perceive him
as an exceptional doctor.

776
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:02,020
Like he has God's hands.
They look at him in a positive light.

777
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:03,438
And how is his health?

778
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:06,107
There's nothing peculiar about him?

779
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:17,660
I haven't been home in days.

780
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,287
What kind of life is this?

781
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,456
This is insane.

782
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:23,208
I've been operating nonstop,

783
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:25,460
but I don't feel tired at all.

784
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:26,544
I'm feeling great.

785
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:28,046
Not tired a bit.

786
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:31,841
Lucky that you're a ghost.

787
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:38,056
I'm a human being.
I need to get off work and sleep.

788
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:45,355
You're not a person.
You're a first-year resident.

789
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:48,316
When I was a first-year resident,
I couldn't go home for a week.

790
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:49,692
I barely got two hours of sleep a day.

791
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:51,736
You're so lazy.

792
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,030
Things are different now.

793
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,865
You're going to keep this up until I die?

794
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:58,826
Don't enter my body so frequently.

795
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:01,412
Wasn't it you who said I had
to keep the promises I made

796
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:03,581
and be responsible?

797
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:13,341
This is getting heavy.

798
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:16,344
Even I can't operate
on an abdominal aortic aneurysm.

799
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:18,471
How is Seung-tak doing it?

800
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:19,430
Doctor.

801
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,767
Maybe we should let him handle
Dr. Cha's patients?

802
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:25,395
He didn't seem to mean
what he said last time.

803
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:27,564
He already operated on two patients
with aneurysms.

804
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:30,608
Maybe he only takes kids
and young female patients.

805
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:34,279
I can't ask him twice
or else I would lose face.

806
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:36,197
We'll transfer the rest
to another hospital.

807
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:48,334
He says we only take on kids
and young female patients.

808
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:51,879
How could he accuse me
of discriminating against some patients?

809
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:55,049
I'm not letting him transfer my patients.

810
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,220
I'm a doctor first and foremost.

811
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:02,056
I didn't make promises only to Seung-jo
and Ji-woo.

812
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:07,270
I don't even have time to screen
which patients I'll take.

813
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:09,355
Just bear with me a few more days.

814
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,690
It will be over soon.

815
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,820
If you don't like it,

816
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:17,614
we can just stop.

817
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:20,533
You call the shots.

818
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,131
Seung-tak.

819
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:39,844
How did he know all that?

820
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:43,473
Why did he only uncover
half of our plan when he knew?

821
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:53,232
I knew my half-sister was up to something.

822
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:55,985
She was in cahoots
with the lawyer, Mr. Lim.

823
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:59,405
My dad gave her control of the foundation.

824
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:02,575
He even took away my inheritance.

825
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,994
How could he donate
his entire fortune to charity?

826
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:07,497
Gosh.

827
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,749
Noblesse oblige or whatever.

828
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:12,752
That's just great, Dad.

829
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:14,629
You had enough. Let's go.

830
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:16,756
Here.

831
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:19,717
Hey.

832
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,515
Do you think I'm a joke too?

833
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:27,433
Because I'm no longer rich?

834
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,519
You're not special either.

835
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:33,022
I heard that your cousin
is going to be the next chairman.

836
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,527
Now, look here. Gosh.

837
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,279
They say he's a genius.

838
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:42,782
Lucky you.

839
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:44,325
You have a talented cousin.

840
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:53,710
I am…

841
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,754
going to go after my half-sister.

842
01:01:57,922 --> 01:01:59,048
Jang Se-jin…

843
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:01,676
I'm going to kill her.

844
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:27,410
Oh gosh. It hurts so much.

845
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:28,327
-My leg.
-This way.

846
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:30,288
Oh gosh.

847
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:34,292
My leg. I'm dying.

848
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:36,544
Oh gosh.

849
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:44,844
What?

850
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,387
Hey, come on. Hurry up!

851
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:51,017
He's so excited.

852
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:53,436
Yes, I'm on my way.

853
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,021
Wait for me!

854
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:02,653
Why did you call me out here
at this late hour?

855
01:03:07,366 --> 01:03:09,076
There's something I want to show you.

856
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:30,890
I'm here.

857
01:03:33,434 --> 01:03:34,519
Hey.

858
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:38,439
Are you here?

859
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:32,285
What is this?

860
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:35,329
They're operating records.

861
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:39,750
Written by Dr. Cha.

862
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,268
Heaven's will has changed.

863
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:41,395
Is it true that there's a change
in Dr. Cha's brainwaves?

864
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:42,813
They call it happy hormones.

865
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:46,359
It's a theory that positive
brain stimulation helps the patient.

866
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:48,819
-Let's go collect happy hormones.
-He needs more happy hormones.

867
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:50,279
Let's use a two-prong strategy.

868
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:52,365
We interact with both people
and terminal patients.

869
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:53,866
We've got work to do.

870
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,952
I'm not slacking off.

871
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:57,828
You better not use me in your romance.

872
01:05:57,912 --> 01:05:59,497
I would never do that.

873
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:01,749
It's you, right?

874
01:06:01,832 --> 01:06:03,125
I'll prove it to you.

875
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:04,835
That Seung-tak is actually Dr. Cha.

876
01:06:06,837 --> 01:06:11,842
