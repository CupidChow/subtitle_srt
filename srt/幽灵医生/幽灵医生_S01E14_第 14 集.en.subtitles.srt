1
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:32,824
It was my fault

2
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,452
that my dad died.

3
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:36,870
Yes.

4
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:38,371
I heard.

5
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:41,708
I can't handle being blamed
for another death.

6
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,043
It stresses me constantly.

7
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:46,337
Not because I can see ghosts.

8
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,466
But because I'm afraid
of causing another death.

9
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,969
Now I realize that.

10
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:55,764
I…

11
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,349
can't live like this anymore.

12
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,561
So please mentor me.

13
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,814
Make me into a good surgeon.

14
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,358
A surgeon who saves lives.

15
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:13,156
Weren't you sick and tired
of the hospital and patients?

16
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:14,908
You're a doctor, right?

17
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:18,578
You changed the course of my life.

18
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:24,292
I'll try to live up to my duty as a doctor
to never give up on a patient…

19
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,420
even in death.

20
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:28,922
Just like you.

21
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,091
And like that old doctor.

22
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:50,902
Thanks to you,
I had a comfortable ride back.

23
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,529
There's no place like home.

24
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,037
Thanks for the ride.

25
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,039
See you again.

26
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:05,875
Is it

27
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,003
because of me
that you can't leave your spirit form?

28
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:10,755
Did you

29
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,967
lose the chance when you saved my life?

30
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:15,885
Or is this a punishment?

31
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,139
Is that why you haven't left?

32
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,769
What if I did miss the chance?

33
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,230
Will you see me off now?

34
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,314
Why…

35
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,110
did you save me back then?

36
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,071
I was

37
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,700
still a doctor at the time.

38
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,618
Two, three.

39
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,203
Seung-tak.

40
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,413
Get the epinephrine.

41
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,373
Seung-tak.

42
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,167
Seung-tak, wake up.

43
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,460
Seung-tak.

44
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,507
You were

45
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,051
looking at me

46
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:03,057
without any idea
of what was going on around you.

47
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,228
Your eyes looked…

48
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,982
so sad.

49
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,653
I had no choice.

50
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:18,698
The living weren't doing their job.

51
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,869
So a ghost had to take over.

52
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,874
I had been a doctor for 40 years
up until that point.

53
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:31,711
My duty as a doctor compelled me to act.

54
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,049
I couldn't resist it.

55
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,467
Have you been…

56
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,720
watching over me since then?

57
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:48,061
Why would I watch over you?
You were afraid of spirits.

58
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:52,398
You ran away from the ghosts as a kid.

59
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:53,816
Later on,

60
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,528
you resisted becoming a doctor.

61
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,658
Then one day,

62
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:06,037
you met someone who was a lot like you.

63
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,331
I did warm up to you

64
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:13,086
after I saw you try to save patients.

65
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,590
Well, after all these years,

66
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,927
there'll come a day…

67
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,723
when I won't see you, right?

68
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,104
I think it was him.

69
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,939
We're not connected

70
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:37,110
by a shared religion, blood type,
or Zodiac sign.

71
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:40,280
He possessed someone to save your life.

72
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,199
And he entered mine
to save a patient that day.

73
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,911
Then it was him?

74
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:50,456
Yes, it was Dr. Oh Joo-myung.
The heart surgeon.

75
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,509
What?

76
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,471
You stood like that
on the day of my funeral.

77
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,432
Are you in conflict?

78
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,808
You broke your promise.

79
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:14,147
You said you'd mentor me
but why did you pass away suddenly?

80
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:20,945
If you had mentored me,
I would've become a better doctor.

81
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,488
Now…

82
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,409
don't blame me for that. You were lacking.

83
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,495
Don't overthink it too much.

84
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,623
Just take it like you did that day.

85
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:36,586
Take satisfaction from saving a life.

86
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,591
That's what you do as a doctor.

87
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,010
I miss you.

88
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,492
Doctor.

89
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,285
You made the right decision.

90
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:11,245
Keeping Dr. Cha here is better.

91
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,748
This is where Dr. Cha
started his career, after all.

92
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,500
We're all a family.

93
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,710
I'll try harder.

94
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,880
You're already doing an excellent job.

95
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:25,802
When we tried talking you out of it,
you were adamant.

96
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,554
But you changed your mind
when Dr. Koh spoke to you.

97
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,723
That hurt a little.

98
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:34,185
It wasn't because of Dr. Koh.
It was because of Dr. Cha.

99
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,312
What?

100
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,233
He wants to stay here.

101
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,746
EUNSANG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

102
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:01,587
You punk.

103
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,757
Do you know what time it is?
You're late on your first day.

104
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,175
I'm late because of you.

105
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,719
-You should've woken up earlier.
-I did wake up early.

106
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,347
I'm not fond of doing errands
for other people.

107
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,476
Enough of the excuses.
Follow me. We've got to do our rounds.

108
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,815
Who makes a first-year resident do this?

109
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,325
How many times…

110
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,122
I told you it wasn't me.

111
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:39,542
Why did you make matters worse?
Why did you get caught?

112
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,962
Dr. Cha will be having surgery in
a few days so there was no need for that.

113
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,547
I'm going crazy.

114
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,633
Why would I want to do that myself?

115
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,094
-Why?
-It was you in the footage.

116
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,472
You were caught going in and out
of Dr. Cha's room.

117
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,141
That's what I don't understand.

118
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,227
I remember leaving your office
and into the hallway.

119
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,812
But I blacked out

120
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,064
and found myself in the lobby.

121
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,984
It's as if I was possessed or something.

122
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,240
Dr. Cha?

123
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,083
Hey, when did you return?

124
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,295
Why are you looking at me
as if you've seen a ghost?

125
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:28,799
You looked happy that day.
Why do you look so disappointed?

126
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,303
Are you sad that you
lost your chance to pop champagne?

127
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,013
Were you…

128
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,767
That was an expensive bottle.
So keep it safe.

129
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,519
Let's open it on the day I wake up.

130
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,272
You possessed Mr. Jang's body
and made him do it, right?

131
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,191
I thought he was the only one
you could possess.

132
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,026
That's a private matter.

133
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:48,986
Then why are you here?

134
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,156
You're going to physically attack me
while you're in his body?

135
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,991
I wouldn't do that using someone else.

136
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,160
I'll beat you up later myself.

137
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,247
I came here to tell you something.
Listen up.

138
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,963
I can't say that. It's embarrassing.

139
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,133
No way. I'm not going to say those words.

140
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,386
Say it.

141
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,012
I'll say it.

142
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,056
Relay to him what I say.

143
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,351
I've been wanting to say this for days.
It's been driving me crazy.

144
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,687
Don't miss a single word, Seung-tak.

145
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:28,067
Nobody can ruin Seung-tak's life.
You wait and see. It's just the beginning.

146
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:29,902
He says,

147
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,572
"Nobody can ruin Seung-tak's life."

148
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,241
Say it with conviction.

149
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,161
What the heck are you doing?

150
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,038
Forget it.

151
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,501
You hatched another plan while I was away.

152
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,753
Well, I'm back.

153
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,257
Don't try anything against Dr. Cha.

154
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,510
He's my mentor now.

155
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,057
-Master.
-Yes.

156
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,106
I want to punch you in the throat.
And don't stand like that.

157
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,111
VIP ROOM 9101

158
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:15,239
Hello, Boss. I mean, Doctor.

159
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,866
What is this about?

160
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:22,455
They'll be doing three shifts
to guard the door 24 hours.

161
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,540
I convinced you to let Dr. Cha stay.

162
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,542
So I have to ensure your safety and his.

163
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,762
He's getting suction
and antibiotic treatments together.

164
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,221
And we're giving him Tazocin
four times a day.

165
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:43,559
To monitor him, he's gotten a sputum
culture test, CBC test, and chest scans.

166
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,228
He could improve in a week or two.

167
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:50,941
If he's been infected with acinetobacter,
it could take longer.

168
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,735
He'll be fine.

169
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,528
He's survived this long.

170
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,447
He won't falter at this point.

171
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,282
He's Dr. Cha.

172
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,868
I'm not going to confront my half-brother.

173
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:04,246
He was only seen coming and going.
There's no evidence he did it.

174
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,624
It's my fault that I wasn't here.

175
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,668
That's not your fault, Doctor.

176
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:12,922
Dr. Cha wouldn't want you to
feel guilty over that.

177
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:16,675
You need to stay in good spirits.
That's what Dr. Cha would want.

178
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,096
Did Dr. Cha tell you to say that?

179
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,680
Yes. What?

180
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,265
Could you tell him this?

181
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,601
I'm fine so he doesn't need to worry.

182
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:29,355
I've waited this long,
so it's no trouble to wait some more.

183
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,358
As long as he wakes up
and comes to me, I can wait.

184
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,657
You keep talking to me as if you're him.

185
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,867
So I have a feeling you have a connection.

186
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,702
Can you speak to spirits?

187
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:44,870
Or is it telepathy?

188
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:45,996
Come on.

189
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,957
I'm not a shaman.

190
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,250
I see.

191
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,961
There was something you wanted to ask?

192
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,672
Never mind. I solved it.

193
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:59,135
I want to just focus on Young-min
and not get distracted by other matters.

194
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,388
All I want is for him to get well
after he gets surgery.

195
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,352
Did you tell her about me?

196
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,813
Did something happen during my absence?

197
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,773
Be careful with what you say.

198
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,358
You've got loose lips.

199
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,027
Why are you blaming me?
You're the one who always slips up.

200
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,405
That tone again!

201
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,157
Let's go. Let's do our rounds.

202
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,952
Looks like you forgot something.
I'm your mentor.

203
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,079
You're my disciple. So show some respect.

204
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,081
I've heard this before from somewhere.

205
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,880
Seung-tak? You're back?

206
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,550
I ordered these beds to be upgraded.

207
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,343
Why aren't we
spending hospital money on this?

208
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,679
Have all of these beds replaced.

209
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:45,473
-Even the bed frames.
-The frames too?

210
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,518
You make a lot of noise
in your sleep.

211
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,104
Every night…

212
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:57,902
Seung-tak, I missed you so much.

213
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:06,619
Have all the desks and chairs replaced
on this side. To comfy and better ones.

214
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,037
Just this side?

215
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:13,209
Seniors who badmouth their junior
who is struggling don't deserve it.

216
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,462
But a senior who can
embrace his junior deserves it.

217
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,593
Seung-tak is back.

218
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,388
I didn't say anything.

219
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,310
What? It's the young doctor.

220
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,730
You're back.

221
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,317
What is this?

222
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,404
What?

223
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,910
He got us what we asked for.

224
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,663
I was curious about how they tasted now.

225
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,666
I wonder if she thanked him.

226
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,007
You brought them gifts?

227
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,884
What about me?

228
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,428
Why are you smiling?

229
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,013
Seung-tak.

230
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,267
We finished installing it.

231
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,184
Have a good day.

232
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,479
You had one of these at your home.

233
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,023
I got one for you for the office
for when you wake up.

234
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,777
Seung-tak. I really needed
a massage chair.

235
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,699
You forgot to say thank you.

236
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,952
You didn't buy it with your money.
Stop showing off.

237
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,790
-There's also a headband.
-I bought it with my money.

238
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,125
This is for the mentoring.

239
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:42,965
It feels so good.

240
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,719
From my neck down to my back.
I was sore everywhere.

241
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,137
It's so soothing.

242
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,513
A spirit needs a massage?

243
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,224
What brings you here?

244
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,146
Hi Tae-shik…

245
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,400
I mean Dr. Ban.

246
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,320
This is good for your joints.

247
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,113
Take care of your health.

248
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,782
You have weak hands, after all.

249
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,327
You can't have weak legs, too.

250
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,748
Why are you giving me

251
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,375
such a meaningful gift?

252
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,841
You can't have unsteady legs

253
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,219
on top of having unsteady hands.

254
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,725
I didn't

255
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:39,730
keep my promise to mentor you.
So I'm making it up to you.

256
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,775
Please drink it.

257
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,697
You were calling me by my name.
I could call you by your name, too.

258
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:53,160
How did you know I had bad knees?

259
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,079
Oh, gosh.

260
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,624
Is she flirting with me?

261
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,251
Oh, gosh. This can't be happening.

262
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,136
Seung-tak. You're here?

263
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,059
You come with treats?

264
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,936
You always bring snacks.

265
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,646
-No, that's not me.
-Then who?

266
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,108
Grandpa.

267
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,567
-Sir.
-Sir!

268
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,403
-Good morning.
-Good morning, sir.

269
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,405
Don't mind me. Continue with your work.

270
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,908
And have these snacks
during your break, okay?

271
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,454
You didn't have to, Grandpa.

272
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,416
I'm not doing it for you.

273
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,334
What? Seung-tak?

274
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,294
What? Hello, Mr. Koh!

275
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,921
What brings you to ER?

276
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,633
I came to go on a date with you, Dr. Oh.

277
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,803
I was going to call you first.

278
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,514
What is all this?

279
00:16:55,597 --> 00:17:01,353
It's a bribe to all of you
not to go easy on my grandson.

280
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,149
He's quite arrogant, isn't he?

281
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:08,444
He's a handful. But I can handle it.

282
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,988
You use your hands to smack my back.

283
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:15,993
-How do you know my grandpa?
-We've known each other for 20 years.

284
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,328
I knew her before you met her.

285
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,081
I meet him once
every three months to hang out.

286
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,125
-Would you like some tea?
-Sure.

287
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,174
I knew you would come back.

288
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,383
I knew it.

289
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,720
-Welcome back.
-How did you know?

290
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,556
I wanted to rip up your letter
of resignation, but there wasn't one.

291
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:38,891
No, not that.

292
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,645
That your late grandpa
saved my life 20 years ago.

293
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,191
How did you find out?
Did your grandpa tell you?

294
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,525
My grandpa knows?

295
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,153
Well, you see…

296
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,238
It's not clear though.

297
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,157
How did you know then?

298
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,077
You were only eight at the time.

299
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,912
What did you see that day?

300
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:04,249
I was very sick that day.

301
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,087
Why does she have a fever?

302
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:40,202
Don't be sick again.
You have to grow into a healthy adult.

303
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,497
And do what you want in life.

304
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,624
Be happy.

305
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:47,876
Grandpa…

306
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,047
loves you a lot.

307
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,469
Grandpa is sorry.

308
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,952
Grandpa?

309
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,580
This way.

310
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,541
Seung-tak.

311
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,210
Get the epinephrine.

312
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,878
Attach the EKG.

313
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,758
Doctor, his blood oxygen levels
are falling.

314
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,136
What can we do? We need to use ECMO.

315
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,679
But Dr. Oh isn't here.

316
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,074
Grandpa.

317
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,117
Grandpa.

318
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,677
What are you doing here by yourself?

319
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,220
Where are your folks?

320
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:10,102
I saw my grandpa
go inside the body of a doctor.

321
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:16,275
What do you mean? Who went into what?

322
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:22,906
My grandpa died today.
He went inside there with a boy.

323
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,621
Are you okay?

324
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:34,293
When I came to, I was in a hospital bed.
Your grandpa was next to me.

325
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:38,714
The boy was his grandson
and the operation was a success.

326
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,300
I found out you were that boy
in med school.

327
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,719
Is that why you were always on my back?

328
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:48,348
Of course. My grandpa went to
great lengths to save your life.

329
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,727
But in med school, you were
skipping classes and slacking off.

330
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,937
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

331
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,065
Your grandpa told me

332
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,986
that I had either hallucinated
or dreamed due to my fever.

333
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:04,239
He said not to tell anyone else
and to keep it a secret between us.

334
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,118
He said that for my sake.

335
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,787
Who would believe a little girl?

336
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:14,833
A lot of people I know now were there.

337
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,585
Was I dreaming?

338
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,837
I don't think I was.

339
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,340
I couldn't see ghosts
like you could after that.

340
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:26,178
I was confused and kept it to myself.

341
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,765
But I realized when I saw you here

342
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,641
that it wasn't a dream.

343
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,602
That what I saw that day was real.

344
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,229
When your grandpa was the director

345
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,149
and my grandpa was a senior doctor,

346
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,026
they were close friends.

347
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,071
Your grandpa came
to the ancestral rite every year.

348
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,325
So you better behave yourself.

349
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,869
My grandpa is watching you.

350
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,829
He's been watching me.

351
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,582
But not just me.

352
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,543
By the way.

353
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:03,548
Don't tell Soo-jung that I'm here
at this hospital.

354
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,470
I don't want to cause her mental anguish.

355
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:12,808
Watching her gives me so much joy.

356
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:25,237
And what did you mean by that?

357
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,489
Mean what? What?

358
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,870
-What?
-You said your heart raced.

359
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:38,041
You said I looked so charming.
Did you mean it?

360
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,211
What if it were?

361
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,213
I was just curious.

362
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,715
Did you mean it then?

363
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:03,024
RESTRICTED ACCESS

364
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:07,279
I'm here.

365
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,158
Are you here?

366
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,872
Why do you always ask me that?

367
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,249
You can't hear me.

368
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:23,503
Your granddaughter is a fine young lady.

369
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:25,881
Yes, indeed.

370
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,049
Your grandson

371
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,051
has a long way to go.

372
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,597
Our grandkids might tie the knot.

373
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,893
That would make us in-laws.

374
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,521
Don't get ahead of yourself.

375
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:45,150
It depends on whether
your grandson improves.

376
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,736
She'll become a fine doctor.

377
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,323
Patients will be lucky to have her
as their doctor.

378
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,366
You've been supporting her.

379
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:58,413
It's rewarding, isn't it?

380
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,211
Thanks.

381
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,670
I'd be grateful

382
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:11,718
if they keep repaying that debt
to society.

383
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,054
Both of them.

384
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:20,143
When you passed away,
I didn't do anything.

385
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,355
If I could turn back time,

386
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:27,567
I would have tried to prevent it.

387
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,987
Only heaven can do that.

388
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,449
You can't control a person's fate.

389
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,496
You should live as long as you can.

390
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:41,623
After I leave,

391
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,584
you'll have so much to do.

392
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:52,968
She said it.

393
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,345
-Seung-tak is back.
-He's been throwing around money.

394
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,889
He expects a hero's welcome.
He didn't do anything great though.

395
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,558
I guess he's all right
after he ran out of the operating unit.

396
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:03,561
He's tough. I'll give him that.

397
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,563
It's because of his background.

398
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:06,982
What a guy.

399
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,401
If I were him, I couldn't have done that.

400
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,820
I'm sure the patient's spirit
went to a good place.

401
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,411
Did you talk to him for me as well?

402
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:22,789
I watched the security footage
like a hawk, punk.

403
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,890
I know you well enough to know

404
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,852
that you would attend the funeral.

405
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:59,951
When I saw you walk
towards the funeral room, I was so glad.

406
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:04,080
You know that I can't be there
even if I wanted to.

407
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,708
Thanks. Good job.

408
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,377
Did you make the rounds?

409
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,504
Then let's begin your training.

410
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,595
Did you bring everything?

411
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:21,473
-Did you forget anything?
-We have these here though.

412
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:22,724
Why bring yours?

413
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,310
When you're a student driver,
your first car is a used one.

414
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,229
You should be honored
to be using my tools for this training.

415
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,399
Did you lock the door behind you?
Did you vacuum?

416
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,400
Vacuum?

417
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:37,155
If I later find my place a mess
when I wake up,

418
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,948
I'm going to sue you for unlawful entry.

419
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:43,912
-But this is what interns learn.
-You sleepwalked through your internship.

420
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:47,999
To master this,
go back to learning the basics.

421
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,628
Go ahead. Start with suturing.

422
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,513
Are you chatting with the banana?

423
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,518
No, that's not how you do it.

424
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,106
Move it.

425
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,485
You have to space it evenly.

426
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,445
Like this.

427
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,782
Like that.

428
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:21,741
There.

429
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,869
You can't do this? It's too hard?

430
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,330
Lower your thumb. Try again.

431
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,460
No, not like that.

432
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,880
I can't believe
I have to teach you this stuff.

433
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:41,469
You have to… No. Work on it all night.

434
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:47,183
How can I possibly finish this in a day?

435
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,561
It's not like I'm paying off
my credit card bills!

436
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:01,573
How can you smile?

437
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:04,033
You're going to have him operate
on your body?

438
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,745
He doesn't even know the basics.

439
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,372
-That'll take a while.
-You never know.

440
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,915
You trained me.

441
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,292
-Doctor.
-What?

442
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,588
How did I train you?

443
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:18,173
When?

444
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,427
Seung-tak says

445
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,055
I'm like a fiercely competitive warrior.

446
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,432
Which is true.

447
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,893
I've always wanted to win.

448
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,060
Against who?

449
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,230
The bullies who looked down on you?

450
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,107
No, the spirit who possessed me.

451
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:39,027
I never knew who he was.

452
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:42,614
So I couldn't argue with him to stop.

453
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,866
He was my lifelong rival.

454
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:50,121
I knew I had to get better at surgery
in order to stop being possessed.

455
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,584
That's how you improved
by leaps and bounds.

456
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,628
That's how it is for Seung-tak as well.

457
00:29:56,711 --> 00:30:00,590
If he can become better than me
then I won't need to possess his body.

458
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,343
I think that's why I'm here.

459
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:07,222
To make him into a skilled surgeon.

460
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:22,362
You need to stay in good spirits.
That's what Dr. Cha would want.

461
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,327
Did you have dinner?

462
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,205
You have a new hairstyle.

463
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,915
I got my hair done.

464
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,042
-Does it look bad?
-You look so pretty.

465
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,003
I'm surprised. It looks great.

466
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,046
You also bought flowers?

467
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,885
I saw a flower shop.
I thought it would freshen up the room.

468
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:28,386
Aren't they beautiful?

469
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,931
They're so pretty.

470
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:33,391
It's romantic.

471
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,560
I wish I could wake up.

472
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:41,941
If I can't save this, then nobody can.

473
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,110
Forceps.

474
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:49,741
It's sweet.

475
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,294
Are you all right?

476
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,171
What? Yes.

477
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,298
The floor is slippery.

478
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,592
Be careful. You could hurt
your pretty face.

479
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:12,013
I wish for you to wake up, too,
my good-looking friend.

480
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,266
And reach your dreams.

481
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,978
Here's a gift.

482
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,485
What is it? Is there someone there?

483
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:27,278
What?

484
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:29,989
It's nothing.

485
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:36,371
I told my parents and yours
that we should hold our wedding in spring.

486
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,466
Hey, isn't that you?

487
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,885
Why did you sneak up on me?

488
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,178
Hey,

489
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,555
you said you were a delivery man.
You're an actor?

490
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,391
That was you in the movie?

491
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,519
I'm not an actor. I was just an extra.

492
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,437
They paid well.

493
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,399
That's so cool.

494
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,068
Why didn't you show that to Bo-mi?
She would've liked it.

495
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,487
It's embarrassing.
I only had a few scenes.

496
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,656
Gosh. It's like you're reading your lines.

497
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,283
You really look like an actor.

498
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,996
When you become famous
and get a leading role in a movie later,

499
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,999
-give me your autograph.
-That'll never happen.

500
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,750
Later? When?

501
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,211
I don't have any hope.

502
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,012
I can't say anything to him.

503
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,474
Hello, Mom.

504
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,395
Who are you?

505
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:44,772
Why are you calling me, "Mom?"

506
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,816
Because you're my mom.
What else should I call you?

507
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,276
Grandma?

508
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,029
How have you been, baby?

509
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,616
You never listen to me.
What kind of daughter are you?

510
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,744
I'll be coming home after work.

511
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,078
Whatever.

512
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,455
I'll also change my field.

513
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,251
Really? You decided to do that?

514
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,627
Will you listen to my advice?

515
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:13,051
My time at the ER is ending.
I'm going to transfer to cardiology.

516
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,052
What?

517
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,262
-You're defying…
-Mom.

518
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,724
I went to med school so that I could
become a doctor like Grandpa.

519
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,601
To follow in grandpa's footsteps.

520
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,019
Why you…

521
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,397
So? You want to follow in his footsteps?

522
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:30,693
He only cared about patients
and neglected his family.

523
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,571
He died from overworking alone
in his office. Is that what you want?

524
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:38,576
No. I want to save lives.
And make a difference in people's lives.

525
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,913
You're really going to do this to me?

526
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,457
If you had the stamina to do it,
I'd support you.

527
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,710
How many times did you take a semester off
because you got burned out?

528
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:52,006
Why the hell do you want
to choose a tough field?

529
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,675
Because I want to live
the life I want and be happy.

530
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,514
I made that promise

531
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,265
to Grandpa.

532
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,656
I made matters worse now.

533
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:21,953
I'm not blaming you, little fella.
Don't take it the wrong way.

534
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,083
I lost this round.

535
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,961
Where am I going to stay now?

536
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,148
Gosh. You killed the patient.

537
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,085
Good. Now use your left hand.

538
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:21,179
You're doing well.
You need to use your left hand, too.

539
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,522
Look carefully. This is the pattern.

540
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,192
-Okay. I got it.
-That's it.

541
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,698
Are you crazy?

542
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,594
Nothing. I was just getting frustrated.

543
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,262
Keep going.

544
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,183
Monitor his vitals, please.

545
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,184
Okay.

546
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:36,587
In the CBC test, his white cell
count has dropped to 11,000.

547
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,464
Same with his CRP and procalcitonin.

548
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,757
I'm so glad, Doctor.

549
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,925
He's improving.

550
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,470
Well, I think he's improving a bit.

551
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:47,181
I haven't seen Dr. Koh lately.

552
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,058
He used to come here so often.

553
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,727
He must be busy.

554
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,857
He's been spending all his time
in Dr. Cha's office. Maybe, that's why.

555
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,486
I wonder what he's doing there all day.

556
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,078
Good. Space it evenly.

557
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,455
Yes, right there.

558
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,500
Slowly.

559
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,725
So he's been training there.

560
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,032
You're there with him…

561
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,078
aren't you?

562
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,599
Young doctor, I know you stayed up late.

563
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:12,767
Could you wake up?

564
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,603
Young doctor. Doctor?

565
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,522
Doctor!

566
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:26,113
Dr. Koh. I was about to call you.

567
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,783
Well, you see.

568
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,035
Why are you transferring Hwang Kook-chan?

569
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,412
Did you already tell him, Dr. Kim?

570
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:36,040
No, I just learned it from you.
How did you know?

571
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:39,085
I told you not to tell him.
He's a busy doctor.

572
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,212
-How could he not?
-Of course, I had to.

573
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:43,047
Is this Director Han?

574
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,299
We discussed this before.

575
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,177
But the family refused
so we didn't take any action.

576
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,889
But the administrative director is mad.
He wants something to be done.

577
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:54,392
He's going to pull financial aid.

578
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,519
The hospital is covering
Hwang Kook-chan's hospital bill.

579
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:59,271
So his wife had no choice
but to sign the transfer papers.

580
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:02,566
What a piece of crap.

581
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,111
The hospital was paying for it?
For what reason?

582
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,363
It's a long story.

583
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:11,117
Is it just Hwang Kook-chan?
What about Choi Hoon-gil?

584
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,495
His family is influential.
They're paying the full costs.

585
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:18,499
I talked with his family
and they rebuffed me.

586
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,877
His dad is a former minister.
We dare not cross him.

587
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,383
Why can't you?

588
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:28,759
Just yell at my family.

589
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,845
Have Mr. Hwang stay here
and transfer me instead.

590
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:36,600
My dad thinks I'm a disgrace
and wanted to send me away.

591
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,352
Who cares where I'm transferred?

592
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,647
You said I could die anytime.

593
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,649
Just pull me off life support.

594
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:03,002
Is it you, Dr. Cha? Tell me that first.

595
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:06,338
What did those patients do?
Why are you taking it out on them?

596
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:10,050
My hunch was correct.

597
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,012
Those coma patients
are helping you, right?

598
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:15,848
They're roaming the hallways
of the hospital.

599
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,892
I talked with his wife already.

600
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,435
I put a hold on the transfer.
I came to tell you that.

601
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,355
Now you're meddling
in administration matters?

602
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,149
You'll cover his hospital bill?

603
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:28,194
There must be a reason why
the hospital has been covering it.

604
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,279
You always weigh the pros and cons first.

605
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,448
You wouldn't have done it
out of compassion.

606
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:35,409
If you want to protect those patients,

607
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:40,498
bring me hard medical data to back it up
that you love so much.

608
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,335
What's your mentor doing?

609
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,086
Right.

610
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:51,008
He turns his back on patients
who don't have a chance of recovering.

611
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,093
Is he still like that?

612
00:41:57,473 --> 00:42:00,726
He's full of surprises.

613
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,395
It didn't make any sense

614
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:07,107
that a delivery man
could cover the hospital fees for months.

615
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,485
Looks like you already knew.

616
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,738
I operated on him.

617
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,952
Seems like he's not on talking terms
with his family.

618
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,371
No wonder they never visited him.

619
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:24,250
Even on the day of his accident,
he was by himself.

620
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,793
I thought he had no family.

621
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,628
-An accident?
-Yes.

622
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,171
I asked him about his scar.

623
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,423
He said it was from an accident
three years ago.

624
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:35,094
He's afraid.

625
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:36,887
Bo-mi left.

626
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,389
And you'll leave soon, Dr. Cha.

627
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,600
If I get transferred,
he'll be all alone here.

628
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:46,522
I was alone before he came
so I know that feeling.

629
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,108
It's so lonely

630
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:50,859
and frightening.

631
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:10,004
I was looking everywhere for you.
What are you doing here?

632
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,171
Do you remember that?

633
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,591
The misaligned C-line?

634
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,720
Who put the C-line in?

635
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:20,889
The patient had a fever due to UTI.

636
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,516
We had to use antibiotics

637
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,020
but his previous line was an old one.
A new one was inserted yesterday.

638
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,856
His fever should've dropped
after antibiotics were administered.

639
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,191
ESR is 70. CRP is 10.

640
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,860
It's still the same.

641
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:35,529
Which means UTI wasn't the cause.

642
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:36,905
Then?

643
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,408
He was brought here after collapsing

644
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:42,661
from difficulty in breathing
while making a delivery.

645
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:46,123
The operation on his infective
endocarditis was a success.

646
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:49,543
There was brain hemorrhaging
and he slipped into a coma.

647
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,171
He's fairly young
and the bleeding was minimal.

648
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:53,589
So we decided to wait.

649
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:56,342
There has to be another cause
since he hasn't woken up yet.

650
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,844
Do you have any guesses?

651
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,222
No. I'll begin looking for the cause.

652
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:07,770
He received a brain CT
scan five months ago.

653
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,522
Let's have him get another CT scan.

654
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,275
He was hospitalized three years ago
due to a traffic accident.

655
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,277
Which means he probably got a CT scan.

656
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:18,656
Find out which hospital it was.
Let's get the scan and compare them.

657
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:20,699
Okay.

658
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:23,327
Mr. Hwang Kook-chan asked me to help.

659
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:31,919
Dr. Cha, you're the specialist.
I've got little hope.

660
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,797
Doctors have been telling my family
to prepare for the worst.

661
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,757
I could die anytime.

662
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:38,634
But…

663
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:41,929
he's got a lot of years ahead of him.

664
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,723
His dream

665
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:46,684
is to be an actor.

666
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,115
I want

667
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,617
to save these patients.

668
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,452
If I can.

669
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:10,124
As long as you and the patients
don't think it's too late,

670
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,459
we can help them.

671
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,091
ER

672
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:23,512
Are you ready for some field training?

673
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,852
Five injured passengers on a bus.

674
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:32,020
One person has a concussion
and his LOC stupor.

675
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:34,731
He's suffering from nausea
and will need a CT scan.

676
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:38,694
Hey Seung-tak! Great!
Come and handle this patient!

677
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:41,613
Just focus on the patient
and nothing else. Let's go.

678
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:43,991
One, two, three.

679
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,376
A motorcycle crashed into a taxi.

680
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,086
And the bus driver behind them
slammed the brakes.

681
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,880
Passengers got tossed around
and were injured.

682
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:00,299
The most critical patient
is the motorcyclist.

683
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,969
It's a multiple-trauma patient.
Intubation.

684
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:06,054
Insert an endotracheal tube
and move him to the examination room.

685
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,973
Seung-tak, just handle the intubation.

686
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:11,852
Dr. Lee will be here soon.
Please prepare for intubation.

687
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,104
What? You won't do all of it?

688
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:20,694
Stay calm. Do what you did in practice.

689
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:23,614
Fully extend the patient's neck first.
Good. Slowly.

690
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:25,824
Use the laryngoscope
to press down on the tongue.

691
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,326
Position it on the vallecula.

692
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:28,744
Pull it.

693
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:31,580
Good.

694
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,878
Hey Seung-tak.
Why did you call me if you're here?

695
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:40,297
Multiple-trauma patient.
I suspect bleeding in the chest.

696
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,590
Insert the chest tube first.

697
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:46,762
Sun-ho, get moving!
Can't you see the patient is critical?

698
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:47,679
Why aren't you helping?

699
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,390
It went in, right? It's in place?

700
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:53,977
Good job. Next.

701
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:01,944
Come this way.

702
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,913
Do it at a right angle. Deep bite.

703
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:14,957
Very good.

704
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,376
Mind the margin.

705
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:18,585
Moderate tension.

706
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:19,545
Good.

707
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:21,713
-Let's do an X-ray.
-Okay.

708
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:44,570
What's gotten into Seung-tak?

709
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:47,864
He used to perform complex surgeries.

710
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:52,244
But he's doing stuff that interns do.
He's avoiding operations too.

711
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,664
Maybe it's because he lost a patient.

712
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,866
-Dr. Jang! This way.
-Okay.

713
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:35,579
You're done.

714
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:39,666
-Yes.
-It's a cardiac arrest. Start CPR.

715
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:29,091
I don't see emergency patients. Why?

716
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:31,051
Because I screen patients
before I accept them.

717
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:33,762
Send Dr. Han. There's no need for an ECMO.

718
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,347
It costs three million
just to prime the ECMO.

719
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:36,390
It would have been a waste.

720
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:39,518
These hands are for patients
who have at least a 1% chance of survival.

721
00:49:58,328 --> 00:49:59,413
Seung-tak.

722
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,039
It's not over yet.

723
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:34,364
Hey, Seung-tak. Do something.
Otherwise, the patient will die.

724
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:52,048
No…

725
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:59,723
The desperation to save a patient's life.

726
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,686
That strong will
connected the two of them.

727
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,856
One became possessed
after the spirit entered.

728
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:09,357
The desperate look on his face.

729
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,027
Will it move the heavens?

730
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:52,818
What? I think he's coming back.

731
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:27,519
You did it, Seung-tak.

732
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:29,813
By yourself.

733
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:32,399
Yes, he did.

734
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:38,071
All his practice paid off.

735
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:41,908
Dr. Koh did that himself, right?
Without Dr. Cha.

736
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:44,202
Doctor?

737
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:48,832
And he must be watching Dr. Koh right now.

738
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,066
It wasn't always like this,

739
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:18,028
but he became this good since he operated
on Dr. Cha's tamponade case.

740
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:20,697
He's been doing complicated surgeries
by himself since.

741
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:24,159
I haven't told anyone this

742
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:26,995
but I sometimes feel like

743
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,247
Dr. Cha is with him.

744
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:32,208
When I see him in the operating room.

745
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:42,969
Did you not hear me?

746
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:46,932
You must not know yet.

747
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:48,683
Or…

748
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:51,937
are you hiding it from me?

749
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:54,230
What are you talking about?

750
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,398
Ask him yourself.

751
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,567
Ask Seung-tak.

752
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:58,652
No, I mean…

753
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:03,823
Ask Dr. Cha.

754
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:11,665
Dr. Oh, have you chosen a field
you want to specialize in?

755
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,667
Yes, I want to be a cardiologist.

756
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,128
Is Dr. Koh dating someone?

757
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:19,464
He's dating someone?

758
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:21,466
He was known to be single his whole life.

759
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:23,593
I made a promise to a girl.

760
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,680
I would be a heart surgeon,
and she would be a brain surgeon.

761
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,062
You want to transfer to another hospital?

762
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:36,773
You're still sticking
with your judgment of me?

763
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,068
Then stay here.

764
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:41,611
With me.

765
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:42,654
Right here.

766
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:50,704
So please mentor me.

767
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:55,792
Make me into a good surgeon.

768
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,461
A surgeon who saves lives.

769
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:03,675
You're a doctor, right?

770
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:07,429
You changed the course of my life.

771
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:24,446
I'm not assuming Dr. Cha's persona.

772
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:26,197
Dr. Cha is inside of me.

773
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:29,325
How?

774
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,329
How is this possible?

775
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,297
How dare you! You threatened Se-jin?

776
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:44,758
What kind of person does that?
You bastard!

777
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:55,852
My cooking skills are rusty.

778
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:58,646
I should've practiced cooking more.

779
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:20,668
Young-min.

780
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,515
I see it now.

781
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:38,978
You were here all this time.

782
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:43,900
With me.

783
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:47,904
He was next to me.

784
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,515
What are you doing this late?

785
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:18,476
As you can see,

786
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,604
I'm building up stamina
to become a great heart surgeon.

787
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,483
You saw me earlier, right?

788
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,652
Did your heart race then?

789
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,864
Yes, my heart almost burst out
of my chest.

790
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:36,202
Is that a protein drink?

791
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:37,620
Good timing.

792
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:40,081
It's better to have one after a workout.

793
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,593
It's even more refreshing
after doing gratifying work.

794
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,263
You're not in a good mood.

795
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:57,474
Is it your mom?
You're not speaking to her?

796
00:57:58,183 --> 00:57:59,392
We called a truce.

797
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:02,270
We had a big fight. She won.

798
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:06,524
I can understand how your mom feels.
Since I know your grandpa.

799
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:11,404
I do, too. But I'm going to keep it up.

800
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,947
Moms always give in eventually.

801
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,035
How is Dr. Jang?

802
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:18,912
Is she all right?

803
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,955
-What?
-You're trying hard

804
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:23,249
to catch up with interns,
but don't neglect Dr. Jang.

805
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:26,711
Come on. Don't compare me to an intern.

806
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:29,047
I saved a man's life with these hands.

807
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:32,383
Look. These are fantastic hands.

808
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:36,888
So you knew all along, Dr. Oh.

809
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:38,890
How did you find out?

810
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:40,058
Did Seung-tak tell you?

811
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:42,560
No. If he had wanted to,
he would've told me sooner.

812
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:45,939
But he hasn't told me
which means he has his reasons.

813
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:49,901
I don't know why
but I'm assuming Dr. Cha told him not to.

814
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:53,613
Speaking of which,
can you not tell Dr. Koh that I know?

815
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,575
My legs are killing me.

816
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:06,376
Scented candles are good for insomnia.
I heard you like lavender.

817
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:07,627
Hey.

818
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,504
I meant that

819
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:11,756
most people like lavender.

820
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,843
I haven't been sleeping well.

821
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,762
Thanks. This will come in handy.

822
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,641
I heard you broke your cup.

823
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,685
Hey, now.

824
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:27,730
Someone outside heard
a cup breaking in your office.

825
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:30,650
Really?

826
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:33,778
I kept forgetting to buy a mug.

827
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:35,780
Thanks again. I appreciate it.

828
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,116
Onions and pickles only, no cucumbers.

829
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,037
You're not supposed to tell her that.

830
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:45,832
That's how I liked it before.

831
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,669
-What?
-I like cucumbers now.

832
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:50,670
But no pickles.

833
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:56,301
Instead of a sandwich, I'd rather have
a hot meal. Did you have lunch?

834
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:04,767
-Enjoy the food.
-Thank you.

835
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:10,857
This place has good reviews.
Are you okay with this restaurant?

836
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,401
Sure. I love chicken.

837
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:19,449
It's delicious.

838
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:27,415
Do you know Dr. Koh's favorite foods?

839
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:29,250
You told me he doesn’t like stews.

840
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:31,919
-What?
-Seafood, steak, or chicken.

841
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:32,879
Which one does he prefer?

842
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,923
He prefers steak over seafood.

843
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:39,010
He doesn't eat chicken.
He got sick once after having some.

844
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:49,771
Why did you want to eat out?

845
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:53,941
I thought I'd treat you to something nice.

846
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:56,319
Because you must be sick
of eating at the cafeteria.

847
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:58,321
How about we eat out tomorrow, too?

848
01:00:58,404 --> 01:00:59,947
What? Tomorrow?

849
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,241
I hate eating alone all the time.

850
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:05,370
It was nice of you
to cook for me that time.

851
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:09,374
The omelet and tofu were delicious.

852
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:11,376
I regret not finishing them.

853
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:13,711
I shouldn't have left leftovers.

854
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:32,980
It's wonderful to be outside for a stroll.

855
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:35,316
The air is fresh
and the streets are pretty.

856
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:37,151
Yes, I agree.

857
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:40,113
It must be stuffy being
in the hospital all the time.

858
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:42,073
How about we do this again sometime?

859
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:45,702
What, the stroll?

860
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:48,871
I had a wonderful time that day.

861
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:51,708
I think I'll go there
with Young-min someday.

862
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:54,794
It'll probably be winter then.

863
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:57,880
I think it'll look nice in winter, too.

864
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:00,216
It's nice, even in winter.

865
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:03,094
I made a promise to Young-min.

866
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:07,223
That after we took our board exams,
we'd take a trip to the Alps.

867
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:09,350
It wasn't after the board exams.
It was after our internship--

868
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,246
Would you like a hot beverage?

869
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:33,458
-Let me…
-I'll go buy it. Wait here.

870
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:41,716
This is strange.

871
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:43,718
What could it be?

872
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:52,435
Answer your phone, will you?
You're making me come looking for you.

873
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,109
You must be dating him.

874
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:03,905
Does your boyfriend know?
That you're cheating on him?

875
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,825
I can't go inside the hospital.
It spooks me.

876
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:10,661
I had you followed.
Waiting for you to come out.

877
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,414
Let's go and talk somewhere quiet.

878
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:15,666
We still have some unfinished business.

879
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,376
I don't have any business. Get lost.

880
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,837
Stay there. I'm not going to kidnap you.

881
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,507
Let's talk brother to sister.

882
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:25,218
Let go. I said let go.

883
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:33,351
I'm losing my temper.

884
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:37,730
I'm losing sleep because I'm so angry
that he punched me.

885
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,942
Hey. It's time to get even.

886
01:03:45,863 --> 01:03:46,989
No.

887
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:50,201
Dr. Koh!

888
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:01,420
Watch out, Dr. Koh!

889
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:05,466
No.

890
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:08,302
Watch out, Young-min.

891
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:17,687
Seung-tak…

892
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:22,525
No…

893
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:30,408
Seung-tak.

894
01:04:30,491 --> 01:04:31,576
Wake up.

895
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:34,078
Please.

896
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:40,960
Wake up.

897
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:44,088
Wake up.

898
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:00,605
Young-min.

899
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:05,109
Young-min.

900
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:10,865
Young-min!

901
01:06:05,544 --> 01:06:06,879
You said you'd do
all of that with her later.

902
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,589
It's not something you can resist.

903
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:10,007
Can you let me have another go at it?

904
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:11,968
-Did that hurt, sweetie?
-Your sweetie is here.

905
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:14,637
Aren't you taking advantage
of my friend too much?

906
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,889
How about we set some rules?

907
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:19,809
I got my hands dirty already. Doing it
again won't make a big difference.

908
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:21,602
I won't last that long.

909
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:23,896
I'm his guardian. I'll make that decision.

910
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:26,399
I also have a say on this matter.
Regarding my duty to him.

911
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:28,401
You'll be handling
your own operation yourself, right?

912
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:30,194
-Where did he go?
-Why can't he see me?

913
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:32,405
Can't you see me, Seung-tak?
Can't you hear me?

914
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:40,204
