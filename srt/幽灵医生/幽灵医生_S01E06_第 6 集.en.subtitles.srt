1
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:36,995
Do you know everything they did?

2
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:38,872
Not all of it.

3
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:39,956
How much do you know then?

4
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,708
Administrative Director
came up with the plan.

5
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:42,959
Chairman's son wants his dad dead.

6
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,377
And Dr. Ahn is also involved.

7
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:49,174
I think they set you up to fail
and also wanted to take you out.

8
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,467
What are you not sure of?

9
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,634
The traffic accident.

10
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,344
Was that just an accident?

11
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,601
Will I die?

12
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,812
Will I die as punishment

13
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:05,899
for what I did to you?

14
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,071
It's a V-fib. Get the defibrillator ready.

15
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,158
We're charging.

16
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,242
Charge. 200 joules.

17
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,119
Everybody, stand back.

18
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,047
His pulse has returned.

19
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:47,440
Is this the patient who suffered
a decompressive craniectomy

20
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,775
and SDH removal?

21
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,861
Yes. He had acute SDH from the accident.

22
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:52,946
He's the patient
who received emergency surgery

23
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:56,241
to alleviate his hypoxic damage
and diffuse axonal injury.

24
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:00,120
He's no longer in a critical state.
The hard work begins now.

25
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,996
Regulate his norepinephrine

26
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,957
and make sure his blood pressure
doesn't rise.

27
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,960
Check his urine levels every hour
and use a diuretic if needed.

28
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,294
Yes, Doctor.

29
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,262
I'm sorry, Doctor.

30
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,599
I'm sorry, Doctor.

31
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,059
Doctor.

32
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,602
I'm very sorry, Doctor.

33
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:31,067
I was waiting by the road
as you were returning to the hospital.

34
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,319
I was only going
to hit your bumper slightly.

35
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,906
I was told to keep you preoccupied.

36
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,534
That's all they said I had to do.

37
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,161
The hospital's legal team officer

38
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,414
was a client of the private
investigation firm I worked for.

39
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,166
They promised me that if I did that

40
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:50,587
they'd give me a big payout.
I did it for the money.

41
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,504
Doctor.

42
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,506
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,259
I'm sorry, Doctor.

44
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:57,802
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,847
I'm so sorry, Doctor.

46
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,539
You were the one

47
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,541
who was behind all this.

48
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,711
He's staying alive longer than I thought.

49
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,588
You look healthy as well.

50
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,133
Dr. Jang seems to be taking
good care of you.

51
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,302
You bastard. Damn you.

52
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,095
Life is so random, you know.

53
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,682
Nothing goes as planned.

54
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,186
I'm not as bad as it may seem.

55
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,688
They keep making things worse.

56
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,191
I hope

57
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:58,571
you'll hang in there as long as possible.

58
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,824
A long illness will wear down a family.

59
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,327
Let's see how Dr. Jang handles it.

60
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,582
Se-jin.

61
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,419
I'm sorry. Did I make you wait long?

62
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,421
No, not at all.
I heard there was an emergency.

63
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,757
Is the patient okay?

64
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,510
Luckily, the patient has stabilized.

65
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:24,681
-Thank you for all your hard work.
-No need to thank me.

66
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,016
I'm part of the hospital faculty.

67
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,228
You said you wanted to talk
about the chairman.

68
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,729
That's right.

69
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,400
Even though I'm a visiting doctor,
I'm still a staff here.

70
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,403
Here I am, asking other people
how my dad is doing.

71
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,906
I saw the news
that my dad woke up from his coma,

72
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,285
but my brother won’t let me see him.

73
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,869
By any chance…

74
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,413
Wait. Don't say it, Se-jin.

75
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:53,042
…is he not recovering well
after he woke up?

76
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,628
-Se-jin.
-I was told that he woke up

77
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,714
but I don't know anything other than that.

78
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,465
I didn't know you couldn’t see him.

79
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,677
I'll look into that right away.

80
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,304
There's another matter, too.

81
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:09,142
Do you know why Dr. Cha left the hospital

82
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,477
after operating on my dad?

83
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,855
What are you talking about?

84
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,523
-You texted me, asking to meet.
-That…

85
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,569
I don't know the exact reason.

86
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,701
I presume it was something important

87
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,287
seeing how he left a patient behind.

88
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,124
Is that so?

89
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:36,878
See you later.

90
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,596
They drew you out of the hospital first
and then planned an accident.

91
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,975
The accident itself wasn't intended,
but the start of it was planned?

92
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,353
What was so important
that you left the hospital?

93
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,856
It's a private matter,
so you don't need to know.

94
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,691
What's your reason?

95
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,779
Doctor.

96
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,656
Will I die?

97
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,244
Mr. Doctor.

98
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,540
Can't you save me?

99
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,503
Seung-jo, I'm sorry to tell you

100
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,090
but I'm not a surgeon yet.

101
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,217
Find that mean doctor

102
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,304
for me.

103
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,558
My doctor…

104
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:37,396
I said I hated him.

105
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,857
That's why he left me.

106
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,444
But I don't hate him.

107
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:51,410
So can you please bring that doctor back?

108
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,664
Tell him I'm sorry.

109
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:58,960
I won't be rude to him again.

110
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,921
Please ask him to do my surgery.

111
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,884
I can't die.

112
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,637
That would make my mom sad.

113
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,611
Yes, Brother.

114
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,779
What is it?

115
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,281
Mommy!

116
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,282
Seung-jo.

117
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,618
Where were you?

118
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,287
I'm sorry, Mom.

119
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,789
I shouldn't have gone out.

120
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,293
No, it's okay.

121
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,171
It's all right.

122
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:49,302
The boy asked the nurse
where Dr. Cha went.

123
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,681
The nurse told him Dr. Cha went far away.
He thinks it's his fault.

124
00:07:56,142 --> 00:08:00,104
He thinks he'll die if he's discharged
without having an operation.

125
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,900
It breaks my heart to see the kid.

126
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,403
Is this how things
usually are at hospitals?

127
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,449
Sometimes.

128
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:18,664
I'm a doctor. I'll eventually die
whether or not I enter your body.

129
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,961
But…

130
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,756
I'm not going to die like this.

131
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,174
It's infuriating.

132
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,888
Let me do it. Give it to me.

133
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:43,689
It's better to be a hidden genius
than a useless moron, isn't it?

134
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:47,026
I can't watch people die.
It's not my style.

135
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,446
-Let me borrow your body.
-Let me borrow your surgical skills.

136
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,156
We have a deal?

137
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,206
-Hold on.
-What now? What's wrong?

138
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,710
There seems to be a breakdown in
the hierarchical system in the hospital.

139
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,298
EUNSANG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

140
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,897
Is that another new suit you own?

141
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,149
Yes, it's brand new.

142
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,235
I buy two suits every season.

143
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,028
That's where you splurge your money.

144
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,155
Why are you talking to me?
You said no talking.

145
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,995
First, when we're around other people,
don't talk to me.

146
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,039
And don't do something
that will get a reaction out of me.

147
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,916
Like telling me my shoelaces are untied.

148
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,877
Be extra careful
when there are CCTV cameras.

149
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,796
You know I'm being closely watched here.

150
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,425
Are you afraid that they'll find out
you can see ghosts?

151
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,718
And then be ostracized by everyone?

152
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,262
I can't get on the board.
Have you met a doctor who sees ghosts?

153
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:02,435
You're walking too close to me.
I need room for my long stride.

154
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,274
Your stride isn't that long.
I'm being careful to give you space.

155
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,487
Gosh, look at the time.

156
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,574
Why you!

157
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,036
Second, be careful
not to touch me accidentally.

158
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:23,789
Keep your distance from me
and avoid bumping into me.

159
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:24,957
That tone again.

160
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,126
You're getting on my nerves.

161
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,435
Let's be careful now.
I can't dodge you when you come like that.

162
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,270
All right, you punk.

163
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,734
He's a character.

164
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,455
Why do you need a coat?

165
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,332
The coat completes the suit.

166
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:07,917
Did you steal it?

167
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,211
I don't borrow other doctor's gowns.

168
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,925
Gosh, why didn't they wash this?

169
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,514
DR. CHA YOUNG-MIN, CARDIOLOGIST

170
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:32,358
Third, don’t tell the other ghosts
that I can see them.

171
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,068
Why not?

172
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,028
You really need to ask?

173
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:44,286
My muscles are tense.

174
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,043
Heart surgeons need stamina.

175
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,220
You're hanging out with him a lot.

176
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,805
You two are friends now?

177
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,350
But you wouldn't do any favors for us.

178
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,309
I know.

179
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,229
You shouldn't play favorites.

180
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,398
All you need to do is possess his body.

181
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:16,318
If we could talk to the young doctor,
I'm sure he would do those favors for us.

182
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,070
That's just his personality.

183
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,996
I was meaning to ask.
Did you receive special training?

184
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,083
You don't need to know about that.

185
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,426
Unpack your belongings.

186
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,221
You don't have to leave the hospital.

187
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,015
Seung-jo will get his operation.

188
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,516
Doctor!

189
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,394
Hye, Seung-jo.

190
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,779
I'm also here.

191
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,172
It really is you.
You're not wearing a mask.

192
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,050
You told Seung-jo you'll operate on him?

193
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,552
How could you handle the operation
when the other doctors can't?

194
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,932
You'll handle that complicated operation?

195
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,767
I never said I would do it.

196
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,978
If it's not you, then who will?

197
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,439
Dr. Ahn?

198
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,484
Are you crazy?
How could you let Dr. Ahn do it?

199
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,486
Dr. Ban won't allow me to
do such a complex procedure.

200
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,820
Dr. Ahn can't handle that operation.

201
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,155
We'll make him do it.

202
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:45,824
Seung-tak.

203
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,826
Are you aware of how complicated this is?

204
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:49,912
Age seven. Patient is Oh Seung-jo.

205
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,289
Suffers from atresia
of the pulmonary artery.

206
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,083
Has ventricular septal defect.
Received BT shunt at three weeks old.

207
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,001
Performed Rastelli procedure.

208
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,087
Stenosis in the right
ventricle-endotracheal tube.

209
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,130
Corrective surgery was scheduled
but it was delayed.

210
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:03,634
Liver functions have weakened due to that.
Pleural effusion has also occurred.

211
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,514
You have a terrific memory.

212
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:09,515
It's not easy.

213
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:10,766
Of course, it's not.

214
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,518
None of my operations are easy.

215
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,105
That's why the patient came to Dr. Cha.
Because it was hard.

216
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,523
-Oh, boy.
-But…

217
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:21,151
I think you could handle it yourself.
You're known for having a steady hand.

218
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,199
-What?
-He's right.

219
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,869
Seung-jo has Kawasaki disease.
Since he was four.

220
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,371
-I guess you didn't know.
-You didn't?

221
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,039
Seems like you didn't know.

222
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,499
Well, that's…

223
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:39,003
A condition where he suffers
from inflammation, right?

224
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,796
It usually inflicts children
aged three or four.

225
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,715
And it produces a lethal complication.

226
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,842
That's correct.

227
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,349
When the coronary artery dilates,
blood will pool there.

228
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,811
That could cause a clot, in which case,
myocardial infarction can happen.

229
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,855
So that has to be addressed using CABG.

230
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,566
So we'll have to use a CABG.

231
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,821
Why are you interrupting me?

232
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,740
So you know.

233
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,867
Stenosis in the right
ventricle-endotracheal tube is common,

234
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,201
but it's complicated
when you introduce CABG.

235
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,704
On top of that, the patient is young.

236
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,415
Right. You have to use an internal
mammary artery underneath the bone.

237
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,835
If adhesions occur,
it's very difficult to just peel them off.

238
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,920
It's going to be hard

239
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,922
just to peel off the internal
mammary artery underneath the bone.

240
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,633
The endotracheal tube
is also stuck to the pleural wall,

241
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:26,759
which makes it hard to peel off.

242
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,010
The adhesions are severe,

243
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,303
and the internal mammary artery
is difficult to peel off.

244
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,721
The left anterior descending
coronary artery

245
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,222
is hard to pinpoint due to adhesions.

246
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,767
It's not a typical CABG.

247
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,103
Due to adhesions,
a second operation is extra hard.

248
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,563
The patient is also young.

249
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,941
Opening the chest will be very complex.

250
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,943
The incision will have to be very precise.

251
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:47,154
So you have to do it slowly.
You can't open up the chest all at once.

252
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:51,367
You could lose the patient
even before you have the chest open.

253
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,454
Since the pleural tube is stuck
to the endotracheal wall…

254
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,291
Why would the pleural tube be stuck there?

255
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,960
It's the endotracheal tube
that's stuck to the pleural wall.

256
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,295
If you do the dissection wrong,
then opening the chest…

257
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,838
Why would you start dissecting?

258
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,883
-You have to open the chest first.
-So you open the chest at once.

259
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,593
What the? Are you crazy?

260
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,595
You have to be precise and do it slowly.

261
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,556
After the dissection,
the coronary arteries…

262
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,854
We're talking about the left anterior
descending coronary artery.

263
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,064
Left anterior descending coronary artery.

264
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,276
-So what I'm saying is…
-So what I'm…

265
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,865
Where did he go?

266
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,172
How could you talk like that nonstop?

267
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,133
Take a break, will you?

268
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,218
You punk.

269
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:56,974
Why are you getting mad
when you couldn't follow my directions?

270
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:00,102
Why didn’t you tell me
about the Kawasaki disease earlier?

271
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:04,189
You should've studied that beforehand.
It's written on the chart.

272
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,983
I told you not to enter my body whenever.

273
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,568
I wasn't the only one to blame this time!

274
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,281
What?

275
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,324
What are you doing here?

276
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,202
I mean,

277
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,538
how can you just barge in here like that?

278
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,457
You should knock before you enter.

279
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,417
You have no manners.

280
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,046
We're not a good team.

281
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:28,547
What?

282
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,467
I don't know why
you're being stubborn about this.

283
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,926
But I can't handle this operation.

284
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,472
Don't give the family false hope.
Have the patient discharged.

285
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:41,852
Dr. Cha did this surgery two years ago.

286
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,023
You were his first assistant then.

287
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,863
A patient like that comes along
once in a lifetime for a doctor.

288
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,323
It's a very rare case.

289
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,159
A patient like that comes along
once in a lifetime.

290
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,368
It's a rare case.

291
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,288
I succeeded in doing the complex surgery.
The first in Korea.

292
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,415
You were a part of that historic
achievement.

293
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,001
I trained you and you were very diligent.

294
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,127
More so than anyone.

295
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,546
I know you've been in my shadow
for a long time.

296
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,926
And that put you at a disadvantage
compared to your peers.

297
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,553
You're up for senior doctor promotion,
aren't you?

298
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,263
This would be a good opportunity

299
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,015
to overcome the botched tamponade.

300
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,603
Will he take the bait?

301
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,898
I know Dr. Ahn well. Just be patient.

302
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,566
He'll take it.

303
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,443
You said before

304
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,237
that I don't have
the right to treat patients.

305
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,880
You gave it your best.

306
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,342
It was a gamble to approach Dr. Ahn.

307
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,637
If he doesn't agree,
don't be so disappointed.

308
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,974
Seung-jo's not my patient.

309
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,101
What?

310
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,647
I don't know why he likes you.

311
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,691
He grabs your coat all the time.

312
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,237
Hey, so you don't have a Dad?

313
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,322
You just live with your mom?

314
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,116
My mom says

315
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,995
your dad left your mom because of you.

316
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,163
That's right.

317
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:28,125
Your mom couldn't pay the bill,
so she cried.

318
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,919
You boys!

319
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,632
How dare you bully someone at a hospital?

320
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,760
Do you know who I am?

321
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,390
I'm Cha Young-min.

322
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,435
I'm the best doctor in this hospital.

323
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,020
Do any of you have a doctor

324
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,355
who is better than I am?

325
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,984
You don't, right? But he does.

326
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:57,070
Seung-jo is my patient.
Get that in your head.

327
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,030
Understand?

328
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,366
Understand?

329
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,118
-Mommy!
-Mommy!

330
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,251
You're smiling?

331
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,777
Yes?

332
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,866
911 RESCUE

333
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,918
Fall down injury from three meters high.
Patient has severe chest pain.

334
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,337
I think he fell on top of a sharp object.

335
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,838
-This way.
-Mental status?

336
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:08,100
And most importantly,
you can only possess me

337
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,477
when it's necessary and I agree to it.

338
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:14,231
You can't come from behind
and enter my body.

339
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,400
Got it. But how will I know
when I can enter?

340
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,195
We'll use a sign.

341
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,240
-I'll wave like this.
-I'm not a pet.

342
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,199
That's not cool.

343
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,576
How about this sign?

344
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,578
I'm not hitching a ride on the road.

345
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,746
How about this?

346
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,873
I'm not a gangster.
That looks like I'm picking a fight.

347
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,542
Okay. I got it.

348
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,755
-What? Have you gone mad?
-You lying piece of crap!

349
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,632
You were having an affair
in the mountains?

350
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,718
Who was it this time?

351
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,303
What's her name?

352
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,888
Ma'am, you can't do that.

353
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:53,312
You used to play pool all the time
but now you switched to hiking?

354
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:58,150
Look at what happened to you
after meeting your mistress?

355
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,320
Oh, gosh. You no-good husband.

356
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:02,654
You lying piece of…

357
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,699
-Hey, come on. Hurry.
-Die.

358
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,326
Why did you come back alive?

359
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,537
-Ma'am, we can't do that here.
-You rotten husband.

360
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,750
Don't. Ma'am, let go of my hair!

361
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,501
Come on! Let go of me!

362
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,587
I'm not the one who cheated on you.

363
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:20,589
Let go.

364
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,927
Why are you pulling my hair?

365
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:29,181
-Intern!
-The patient's blood pressure is falling.

366
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:31,975
Let go of me!

367
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,352
-Sir!
-Let go of my hair!

368
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,981
Sir. He's unconscious.

369
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,441
What's the meaning of this?

370
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,486
I'll save his life, so kill him afterward.

371
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,780
Step outside. He's in safe hands.
Intern, take her away.

372
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:46,823
-Okay.
-Dear.

373
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,077
-Dear.
-Ma'am. Please come with me.

374
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,164
-His X-ray and CT.
-What?

375
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,208
We have them.

376
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,293
Here you are.

377
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,213
His ribs got fractured
and they punctured his aorta.

378
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,340
His blood coagulated
and blocked his vessels.

379
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:04,549
Then it burst again.

380
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,510
His wife is one tough lady.

381
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,888
-What should we do? Operating room?
-We don't have time. We'll do it here.

382
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,224
-Again?
-Gloves.

383
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:20,565
You promised me a senior doctor position.

384
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:26,905
Dr. Ahn, you don't see the gravity
of the situation you're in.

385
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:31,535
How can you bring that up
after ruining the plan?

386
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:37,040
You had one chance to do it right.
Why didn't you complete it?

387
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:41,586
You backstabbed your mentor
when you agreed to our terms.

388
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,505
Don't you see that?

389
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,843
If you operate on Seung-jo,
I'll be your first assistant.

390
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,721
-What?
-I'll back you up.

391
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,683
You know I have skills, right?

392
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:55,851
You saw me operate.

393
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:06,111
Seung-tak.
I heard you saved another patient.

394
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:10,407
Be honest with me now.
Who is training you?

395
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,534
-You can tell me.
-He got an aorta operation.

396
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,952
So regulate his blood pressure
to prevent it from rupturing.

397
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,579
Keep it between 100 and 120.

398
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,873
What?

399
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,041
What?

400
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,211
Dr. Ahn, you're lucky we're in
an operating room. Get out of my sight.

401
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,214
-If you do something like this…
-Sun-ho, I gave you an order!

402
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,346
Regulate his blood pressure.

403
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,895
What? How could you tell me he's here?

404
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:41,980
What's the matter?

405
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:44,983
The husband of the woman
that had an affair with the patient

406
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,735
is on his way here.

407
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,279
Why would he come here?
He says he's going to kill the patient.

408
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,989
-What?
-And also the doctor.

409
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,158
-What?
-The husband is a gangster.

410
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:55,911
He already created a commotion at ER.

411
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,287
Call security.

412
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,622
I already did.

413
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,416
Doctor, you can't just leave like that.

414
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,263
Koh Seung-tak.

415
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,975
So you're the quack
who saved that bastard's life?

416
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,186
Do you know me?

417
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,146
Why you!

418
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,068
Wait a minute! Let go of me.

419
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,277
That quack!

420
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:31,488
Hold on.

421
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,406
Wait a sec. Let go.

422
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,367
I'm going to kill that quack!

423
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,327
Do you know how much
this watch costs? Let go.

424
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,620
Let go of me.

425
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,455
-Our deal is over.
-Let go of me.

426
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:42,290
My watch. Come on!

427
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,293
-That's my line.
-I said it's expensive.

428
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,461
Get off me.

429
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:58,265
Send me CCTV footage

430
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,059
of Dr. Koh every day.

431
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,604
What? Every day?

432
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,198
Hey!

433
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,868
You're the one
who broke your promise first.

434
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,704
You said we have to agree beforehand.

435
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:22,747
I got my hair pulled.

436
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,082
Right here.

437
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,792
It was your hair, not mine.

438
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,586
Anyway, I did what you asked.
Time to do me a favor now.

439
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,424
You demanded all sorts of terms.
I only asked for one.

440
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,009
Your cooperation to uncover the truth.

441
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,011
What?

442
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,888
You're upset over getting punched
in the face? Come on!

443
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,768
Yes, Brother. What is it?

444
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,688
Really?

445
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,403
Doctor, I'm getting an operation tomorrow.

446
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:55,488
That's great.

447
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:59,200
We'll schedule it at 8:30 in the morning.

448
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,953
There'll be a few tests given today.

449
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,539
He mustn't eat anything after midnight.

450
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,082
Okay, Doctor.

451
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,294
Check his liver levels
and make sure it stays steady.

452
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,755
Get permission
from the Anesthesiology Department.

453
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,506
Sure, Doctor.

454
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:28,021
We'll make Dr. Ahn
do the operation somehow.

455
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:30,106
And you'll be with him.

456
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,650
-Then what?
-Then…

457
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,736
you take over and put your skills to work.

458
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,947
Seung-tak keeps amazing me.

459
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:41,284
Is he trying to be some kind of hero?

460
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:46,456
Because of your blunders,
you're giving Seung-tak

461
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,666
more chances to prove himself and succeed.

462
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:50,251
I'm sorry.

463
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,129
Seems like you suddenly got ambitious
about advancing your career.

464
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,591
Without any prodding, you stepped in
and took on Dr. Cha's patient.

465
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,970
Have you become desperate
as the senior-doctor hiring is near?

466
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,849
I have to look out for myself.

467
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,144
I betrayed my mentor who I trained under.

468
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,439
So I've got nothing to lose.

469
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:17,862
Well, if you want to prove your skills,

470
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:19,489
then be my guest.

471
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,533
In that case, I'll support your promotion.

472
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:24,994
Now the other matter.

473
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,832
How is the chairman doing?

474
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,460
Is there anything
to be concerned about him?

475
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:37,465
No.

476
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,676
Just proceed as usual.

477
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,139
And don't leak his condition to anyone.

478
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,307
Especially be careful around the doctors.

479
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:47,976
Good luck

480
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,311
with tomorrow's operation.

481
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:51,813
Thanks.

482
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,159
It wouldn't bother me
if you failed tomorrow.

483
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,246
What are we doing here? It's your office.

484
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,706
No. I have to see someone.

485
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:10,999
Please.

486
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,753
Please save my brother's life.

487
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,172
I'll come up with the money
to cover his treatment.

488
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,549
You need to talk
with the administration office.

489
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:21,342
You can't do that here.

490
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,803
Nobody there will listen to me.

491
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,305
Please, I beg you.

492
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,182
-Please.
-Come on, now.

493
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,519
Please.

494
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:33,563
Please.

495
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:35,690
That's my sister.

496
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,534
Please don't cry.

497
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:53,374
Both of our parents died.
So it was just the two of us.

498
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,797
She's a high school senior
and gets good grades.

499
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,925
I wanted to put her through college.

500
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,678
But I can't afford the tuition.

501
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:15,146
I started doing food deliveries
by motorcycle.

502
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,818
I came down with the flu
after overworking myself.

503
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,573
But I didn't see a doctor.

504
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:28,076
I just took some cold medicine.

505
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,538
After taking it on an empty stomach,

506
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,708
I didn't feel well.

507
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:38,586
Then…

508
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,490
At first,

509
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,285
I thought I was lucky to be admitted
to this hospital.

510
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,204
But nobody came to see me.

511
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,790
Nobody is looking after me.

512
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,001
My medical bill is probably huge.

513
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,507
Please save my life, Doctor.

514
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,136
If you save my life,

515
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,346
I'll reveal the truth.

516
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,641
And serve time for what I did.

517
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,312
I can't let my sister fend for herself.

518
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,397
I can't go like this, Doctor.

519
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,357
Please, Doctor.

520
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:43,902
Dr. Koh.

521
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,325
Please help me.

522
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,414
What are you doing there?

523
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,752
What business do you have here?

524
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:10,428
I needed to find out something
to transfer a patient.

525
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:11,971
I was taking a short break here.

526
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,598
Playing a mobile game.

527
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:14,807
See you.

528
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,690
That's the guy. He did this to you.

529
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,735
He also has a doctor helping him.

530
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,575
Then was he the one

531
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,078
who was knocking on the door?

532
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,758
The chairman doesn't seem to want you

533
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:51,469
to see him in his frail state.
He can't walk properly.

534
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,806
He has refused visits
from everyone except his son.

535
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,559
He also looked depressed

536
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,980
so I've contacted the Psychiatric
Department to have them see him.

537
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,189
Don't worry too much.

538
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,483
He'll ask to see you soon.

539
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,443
I see.

540
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,864
You are always so kind.

541
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,286
But I'm concerned that you're spending
all your time at the hospital.

542
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:22,583
How about I take you out to dinner?
To get some fresh air.

543
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,751
I'll be working late today.

544
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,170
Don't you dare ask her out.

545
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,381
Thank you for the offer.
But maybe next time.

546
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:29,674
I'm exhausted today.

547
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,679
Sure then.

548
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,015
Let's try another time then.

549
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,247
If you want to support the medical staff,

550
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:05,334
you need to know
what goes on around the hospital.

551
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,797
Start from the bottom and learn as you go.

552
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:37,742
How could you discharge a patient
because they couldn't pay the bill?

553
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:38,910
How could you do that?

554
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,411
It's not even a lot of money.

555
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:41,746
Take it out from my salary!

556
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:44,332
You're on an intern's salary.
You can't keep saying that.

557
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,708
How will you support yourself?

558
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,919
I don't have time to eat anyway.

559
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:50,088
I don't mind sacrificing for a patient.

560
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,339
Take it out of my salary!

561
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,841
I still have some left.

562
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,894
Thanks to you,
I still have a portion of my salary.

563
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,105
So that's part of my 12-month
installment plan.

564
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,107
Thank you.

565
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,484
-Wait.
-Yes?

566
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,154
You have something stuck on your hair.

567
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,701
It's my lunch.

568
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,124
I was a little hungry.

569
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,546
You're a very nice person.

570
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,006
You'll have good fortune.

571
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,550
Thanks again.

572
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,114
What is it?

573
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,158
Talk to Dr. Lee if it's not urgent.

574
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,534
Ma'am, are you okay?

575
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,161
Dr. Ahn, hurry.

576
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:46,704
What is it?

577
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,539
Hey Seung-tak!

578
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:15,650
Dr. Ahn had to see an emergency patient
in ER. So I came instead.

579
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,237
I usually don't do favors like this.

580
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,823
One injection and three checks a day.

581
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,158
Right?

582
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:30,831
That doctor is very diligent.

583
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:34,252
He always does a routine check
four times a day.

584
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,344
Let's see.

585
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,013
This is norepinephrine.
It's a drug treatment for his heart.

586
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:47,723
This is lasix.

587
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:48,766
A diuretic.

588
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,935
Tell them the patient needs monitoring.

589
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:54,355
Dr. Ahn said the patient
had to be closely monitored.

590
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:58,442
The doses will vary depending on
his blood pressure and urination.

591
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,404
He's being given seven micrograms
of epinephrine per hour.

592
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:06,450
The patient is getting seven micrograms
of epinephrine per hour

593
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,868
but how much could it be now?

594
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:11,205
If I don't regulate the dose,

595
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,874
the patient's heart might stop
or he could bleed.

596
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:18,546
He might even open his eyes.

597
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,630
What?

598
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,716
I told you this would work.

599
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,886
What will it be? Should I just leave?

600
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,055
No. Come in.

601
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:58,836
You're really going to inject that?

602
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,589
Of course.

603
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,843
If I don’t inject him,
the bodyguards will get suspicious.

604
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,888
You're invisible,
so it might not matter to you.

605
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,097
But it matters to me.

606
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,184
Can't you see them watching?

607
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,437
You're distracting me. Get out.

608
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:29,700
Hold it right there.

609
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,955
What you're doing is very reckless.

610
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,207
It's very troublesome.

611
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,419
Use this.

612
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,713
There's no place in this hospital
where I don't have access.

613
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:53,474
Then should I ask the patient
if I should give him the dose?

614
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,852
You're being insolent.
Show some respect to the chairman.

615
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,401
I need you to get out!

616
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,738
-Give it to me.
-What?

617
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,115
-I said give it to me.
-No.

618
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,834
What are you doing?

619
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,843
Please excuse me.

620
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,976
He's good at acting.

621
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,187
What was that?

622
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,486
You scared me!

623
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,821
How did you come out of there?

624
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:15,658
If my half-brother learns
that I came here, you'd get fired.

625
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:16,951
I know his personality.

626
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,704
You better not stop me from coming here.

627
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,248
Don't fear losing your jobs.

628
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,542
I won't put that in jeopardy.

629
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,881
Have you changed your mind?

630
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,720
Well, the situation has changed.

631
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,404
I could unlock it with his fingerprint.

632
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,578
I remember Young-min

633
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:05,082
as someone who had a strong
sense of duty to his patients.

634
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,002
I wondered

635
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:11,338
what could've compelled him to leave
before his patient woke up.

636
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:14,258
It was me supposedly.

637
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:16,510
The one who asked him out.

638
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:21,098
I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU BEFORE
I GO. WAIT FOR ME AT THE SPOT

639
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:24,977
One of the people behind this used me
to draw Dr. Cha out.

640
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,438
Why aren't you revealing

641
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:29,607
what you know, Dr. Koh?

642
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,027
I stay away from complicated stuff.

643
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,115
And I don't have evidence.

644
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:43,787
But…

645
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,706
there is a witness.

646
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:50,753
It's the motorcyclist
who collided with Dr. Cha's car.

647
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:53,797
If he wakes up, he might be a key witness.

648
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:56,425
I'll take over this patient's care.

649
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:58,886
Can I see his chart?

650
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,973
Will she be all right

651
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,642
to be involved in this?

652
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:06,560
I'll be helping her.

653
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,729
And keep her out of harm's way.

654
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,608
I know her.

655
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,612
She's a brave woman
and won't stand for injustice.

656
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,990
She won't listen
if you try to dissuade her.

657
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:24,119
I'm really curious.

658
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:25,996
What is it between you two?

659
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,165
It's a private matter.
You don't need to know.

660
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:33,420
I'm curious about something.
How were you able to see ghosts?

661
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:37,341
You think I'll answer that?
You really have to ask?

662
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:38,509
Are we friends now?

663
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:41,053
He's pouting now.

664
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,138
He's so petty.

665
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,562
I didn't answer because I don't know

666
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:52,689
what relationship we have.

667
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,317
I really don't know.

668
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,447
EUNSANG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

669
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:50,581
Seung-jo.

670
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,208
You'll be brave and strong, right?

671
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:55,669
Yes.

672
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:57,087
I'll be strong.

673
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,569
-Let's go.
-Okay.

674
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,832
We're going to the brain MRI room, right?

675
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:19,878
One, two, three.

676
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,395
Ahn Tae-hyun.

677
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,694
No…

678
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:47,197
Seung-tak.

679
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,532
Seung-tak!

680
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:49,783
Can you hear me?

681
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,244
Come out, Seung-tak!

682
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:21,690
Please…

683
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:25,611
No.

684
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:42,127
-Can we begin?
-Yes, you can start.

685
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:44,713
Age seven. Patient is Oh Seung-jo.

686
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:46,214
Correcting the right
ventricle-endotracheal tube

687
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,549
with the help of CABG.

688
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:50,844
Scalpel.

689
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:55,557
Excuse me!

690
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:57,851
Where is Tess?

691
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:00,103
Whoever tells me first gets a favor!

692
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,563
-ER!
-ER.

693
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:02,939
ER.

694
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:07,235
Yes!

695
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:12,741
Hand me the bovie.

696
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:18,455
Oh, no.

697
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,674
Are you crazy?

698
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:33,637
I'm not supposed
to put my hands down to the ground.

699
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,597
I almost touched the ground.

700
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,641
Why did you ask for the bovie?

701
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:40,936
Wasn't that my job?

702
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:44,147
Go out and wash your hands.

703
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,440
Okay.

704
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,825
Oh, gosh. What an imbecile.

705
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:58,453
I'm sorry.

706
00:49:58,537 --> 00:49:59,996
Please give us a moment.

707
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,044
No, it's nothing.

708
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,848
Where is he? What's the hold-up?

709
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:20,809
Soo-jung, are you crazy?

710
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:24,312
How could you let the patient drink water
ahead of emergency surgery?

711
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:26,022
Why didn't you give him
his lunch while you were at it?

712
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:28,024
It wasn't me who gave it to him.

713
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,737
But it was my mistake
for not telling the family

714
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,238
that he mustn't have water.

715
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:34,322
I'm sorry.

716
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,326
Are you giving me an attitude?

717
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:41,455
No, I'm admitting my mistake
and reflecting upon it.

718
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:42,831
I'll excuse myself.

719
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:50,255
It's always the pretty doctors
who cause trouble.

720
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:52,507
I know.

721
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,968
What's the point of mopping the floor
when someone will get it dirty?

722
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:56,428
Who was it?

723
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:57,971
It was you!

724
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,056
Why are your shoes so dirty?

725
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:02,017
-What are you doing?
-Why are your shoes muddy?

726
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:06,396
-Wait.
-Stay still. Let me clean them.

727
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,355
Hey!

728
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:08,482
Tess!

729
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:10,859
We have an emergency.

730
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:22,871
What are you doing?

731
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:24,998
Do the suction now.

732
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,294
Hey!

733
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:31,087
Not there.

734
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:33,423
Isn't it here?

735
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:38,887
I can't see where it's bleeding.

736
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,223
Avoid the blood.

737
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,476
To the side!

738
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:47,229
Here.

739
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:51,900
Who are you again?

740
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:55,070
Where are you?

741
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,639
Please.

742
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:29,855
Alright.

743
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:38,488
Pull the army navy retractor.

744
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:43,994
Pull it back more.

745
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:45,120
More.

746
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,248
More!

747
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:52,294
Do it right!

748
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,383
Oh, gosh.

749
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:19,070
Sorry. I'm late, aren't I?

750
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:26,161
-What's up, man.
-What the? Are you crazy?

751
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:28,371
Then what sign will we use?

752
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,170
You can't even do that?

753
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:36,546
Bad teamwork.

754
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:39,174
We're in the operating room, right?

755
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:40,175
Let's go.

756
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,473
Who was that?

757
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:57,651
What?

758
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:07,202
What am I doing here?

759
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:27,180
-Bovie.
-Let me pull it back. Give it to me.

760
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:55,583
Oh, no.

761
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,420
The right ventricle-endotracheal tube
has burst.

762
00:54:58,503 --> 00:54:59,462
How will you solve this?

763
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,094
Hand me the Prolene 5/0.

764
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:25,447
The tube and bone are close
to each other. It can't be sutured.

765
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:26,906
Give me the bovie.

766
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:29,743
Come on. Stop the bleeding.

767
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:32,203
Are you going to let him bleed?

768
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,336
Bovie.

769
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:57,020
That's enough. Another Prolene 5/0.

770
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,403
Move aside. We're changing places.

771
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:50,740
What's the meaning of this?

772
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,492
This is a 12-hour operation.

773
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:54,744
The easiest part was
dissecting the adhesion.

774
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,205
You barely handled that step,

775
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,916
so it's obvious the next steps
will overwhelm you.

776
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:12,637
If the boy dies, not only will you miss
the chance to become a professor

777
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:16,015
but might not be able
to practice medicine.

778
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:36,786
Next, we'll dissect
the internal mammary artery.

779
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:03,521
Pull it more.

780
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:13,615
We'll replace the right
ventricle-endotracheal tube now.

781
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:14,991
Give me the artificial heart valve.

782
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:41,559
We did it.

783
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:48,543
We did it.

784
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:11,876
I'm lucky that you're a ghost doctor.

785
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:14,045
If you were the Jade Emperor
or a baby shaman, I'd be in trouble.

786
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:15,004
So let me explain.

787
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:17,423
Let's be careful.
I can't do everything by myself.

788
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:18,841
You're afraid they might find out?

789
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:21,010
You should be proud of being a fan.

790
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:23,388
-You can't buy me lunch?
-I'm no fool.

791
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:27,392
Doctor. What are you doing inside him?

792
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:29,894
-Am I not your first?
-Are you sure it works only on me?

793
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:32,146
Are you leaving soon?

794
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,481
Are you afraid someone will find out?

795
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:35,358
-Surgery?
-Why isn't Seung-tak here yet?

796
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:37,068
Our deal ends here.

797
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:44,867
