1
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,245
Excuse me.

2
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:41,750
If you're still around,
let's try to save her.

3
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,254
Her pulse is weak
but I don't think she has a blood clot.

4
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,338
She's turned pale.

5
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,049
She has neurogenic tumors
around her face and wrists.

6
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:53,595
I think it's neurofibromatosis, right?

7
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,513
What? What kind of disease is that?

8
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,515
It's a medical condition.

9
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,310
Symptoms include burst blood vessels
despite no bruising.

10
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,605
She needs decompression quickly.
Blood is seeping into her lungs.

11
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,483
Let's save her.

12
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,563
I'm all right. I'm alive.

13
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:49,943
Hey, Mister.

14
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,195
You can't just leave her like that.

15
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,781
You said she has
some sort of neuro condition.

16
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,951
You're not going to help her?
You're a doctor.

17
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,371
If you're still around,
let's try to save her.

18
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,416
Right now?

19
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,589
You already checked her hand.

20
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,762
He's such an armchair expert.

21
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:02,348
911 RESCUE

22
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,525
Patient is in her fifties
and collapsed near Jayang crossroad.

23
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,693
Displays signs of neurofibroma.

24
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,778
-Seung-tak?
-After collapsing,

25
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:16,863
she received emergency first-aid.

26
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,156
-Yes?
-She has recovered.

27
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,451
-It took nine minutes to transport her.
-Yes, it's me. Seung-tak.

28
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:25,163
This way.

29
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,297
Hey, Seung-tak! Come on. Hurry up.

30
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,800
All right. I'm coming.

31
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,012
These interns need more training.

32
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,732
-Where's Seung-tak?
-He's right behind.

33
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,025
Two, three.

34
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:54,984
Be careful.

35
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,362
Ventilator? Ti O2 1.0.

36
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,198
Ma'am. Can you hear me?

37
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,991
Peep 5. Tidal volume, 400cc.

38
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,077
-Set the RI to 15A.
-Can you hear me, Ma'am?

39
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,957
Monitor the EKG
and her oxygen saturation levels.

40
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,167
Have the ABGA ready and also the C-line.

41
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,004
I saved her.

42
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,424
These hands are golden.

43
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,468
I have the magic touch.

44
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,096
Ma'am, can you hear my voice?

45
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,348
What's the situation?

46
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,016
She collapsed in the street.

47
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,977
Luckily, Seung-tak administered
emergency first-aid.

48
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,479
-So her condition has stabilized.
-What? Who?

49
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,941
Seung-tak, what's going on here?

50
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:47,120
I think the patient has neurofibromatosis.

51
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,162
What?

52
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,960
Neuro… What is he talking about?

53
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,379
I've heard of it
but I don't know what it is.

54
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,971
How did you treat her? What did you do?

55
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,056
Emergency treatment?

56
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,977
Well, I reacted quickly.

57
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,106
What kind of answer is that?

58
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,192
Well, you can't possibly know everything.

59
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,906
The patient showed
signs of spontaneous hemothorax.

60
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,617
So I decompressed her chest
by inserting a tube.

61
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,828
She probably has artery bleeding
so give her plenty of PRBC.

62
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,455
Perform a CT scan. If her vitals are okay,

63
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,622
have the Diagnostic Imaging Department
do an intervention.

64
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,166
Perform it in the operating room
if they can't do it.

65
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,084
You arranged that, right?

66
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,627
Yes, sir.

67
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,670
I mean, yes.

68
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:41,716
But you were outside.

69
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,803
What kind of tube did you use?

70
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:46,971
-What?
-Geez.

71
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:48,931
Really?

72
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,224
Please.

73
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,809
What's your problem?

74
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,272
I borrowed soju, a knife, and scissors
from an outdoor bar.

75
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,690
Plucked a straw out of someone's hand.

76
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,608
Disinfected them with soju.
Then I made an incision with a knife,

77
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,984
opened it up with scissors,
and inserted the straw.

78
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:04,781
Satisfied, Dr. Ahn?

79
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:06,365
Any more questions?

80
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,117
If you do, ask them now.

81
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,746
-Perform a CT scan on her.
-Okay.

82
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,039
I'll call the diagnostics department.

83
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,544
Fast thinking. A straw…

84
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,046
Now look here.

85
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,323
Seung-tak told you that himself?

86
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,617
He said he injected the heparin?

87
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,995
So I thought Seung-tak gave
the chairman heparin after I did.

88
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,124
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,585
Keep a close eye on Seung-tak for now.

90
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,398
Excuse me.

91
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:24,735
If you're still around,
let's try to save her.

92
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,362
Do you…

93
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,365
know it's me by any chance?

94
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,578
I was walking around like this all day?

95
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,080
This is crazy.

96
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,040
You scared me, punk!

97
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,554
Hold it!

98
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:20,082
I haven't been to a barbershop in a while.
Maybe I should get a hippy perm.

99
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,461
How is this possible?

100
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,379
How can you be so calm?

101
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:29,133
Are you not alarmed
by what just happened to you?

102
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,685
The patient is getting a CT scan.

103
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,812
Dr. Ahn said she won't need an operation.

104
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,148
Really? Good to hear that.

105
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,027
Didn't you call in sick?
What were you doing at Jayang crossroad?

106
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:49,612
In your pajamas.

107
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:51,864
What?

108
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,825
Well, I…

109
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,037
I was jogging. I'm an extreme runner

110
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,790
and I lost my way after running too far.

111
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,501
Then I saw a lady in trouble.
Coincidentally…

112
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,004
Is that how you explained yourself?

113
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,051
I've been acting weird, haven't I?

114
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,512
Blabbering away like a madman.

115
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,515
Yes, you've been acting strange, lately.

116
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,977
Do you know what's causing it?

117
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,813
Yes, I do.

118
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:30,736
I'm working as a doctor
and it's not a good fit for me.

119
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,071
I just like having a good time.

120
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,865
You know cognitive dissonance, right?

121
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,076
Mental discomfort you get

122
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,870
from holding two conflicting beliefs,
values, or attitudes.

123
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,083
Even your excuses are annoying.

124
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,501
So you see…

125
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,047
If you think I'm acting strange or crazy,
slap me on the back really hard.

126
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,632
Like you did earlier.

127
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,676
To knock some sense into me.

128
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,595
-Okay?
-Wait, that's not a good idea.

129
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,305
She's got a very strong arm.

130
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,599
If she does that,
she'll kick me out of your body.

131
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,267
-No. Say no to him.
-Okay.

132
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,518
What the heck?

133
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,936
I meant to tell you earlier,

134
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,856
but I'm glad you're my friend, Soo-jung.

135
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,235
I think I'll head home now. Bye.

136
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,488
You should try this soft drink.
It's the best-tasting one.

137
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:16,616
You punk.

138
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,327
Take back the request you made her. Hey!

139
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,040
This tastes weird.

140
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,916
That's just how that drink tastes.

141
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,877
Pick the blue one next time.

142
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,926
Hey.

143
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:36,844
Hey.

144
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,512
Hey.

145
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,139
You can see me, right?

146
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,726
Your shoelaces are untied.

147
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,480
I almost forgot.

148
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:50,399
You left your phone back in the ambulance.

149
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:54,528
I knew it. You can see me, can't you?
You can hear me, too. Right?

150
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,446
You piece of…

151
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,495
Your car isn't there.

152
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,257
My car.

153
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,802
Where's my car?

154
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,012
My car!

155
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,766
NOTICE OF FINE

156
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,158
What are you doing?

157
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,871
Do you find this place comfy?

158
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:54,922
They say it's better to be alive
living in a ditch than being dead.

159
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,051
What?

160
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,054
Seeing how you're upset,

161
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,849
something happened to you today.

162
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,186
Why didn't you tell me about that?

163
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,814
I had no idea you would do that.

164
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:16,694
You're not someone
who listens to other people either.

165
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,574
What would've happened to me
if I wasn't able to re-enter his body?

166
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,742
It's obvious. You'd die.

167
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,329
Your soul dies there,
while your body dies here.

168
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,207
Are you scared?

169
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,128
But you managed to make it back.

170
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,174
Seung-tak reached out to me first.

171
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,050
He asked me to come back.

172
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,261
So that we could save the patient.

173
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:48,184
He actually did that
to save someone's life?

174
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,852
Goodness.

175
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:53,063
Well, he's a smart kid.

176
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,315
Since he's smart,

177
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,358
it would have been strange
if he didn't catch on by now.

178
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,403
Oh gosh.

179
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,782
That means the kid saved your life today.

180
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,201
I wouldn't say that.

181
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,119
Don't even say that.

182
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,078
I'm offended.

183
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,206
Does he know that it's you?

184
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,503
I'm not sure about that.

185
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,048
I don't know what's going on

186
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:23,219
but the two of you have some kind
of a special connection.

187
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,722
You won't be bored at least.

188
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:31,352
All ghosts have a problem, you see.

189
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:35,481
It's passing time and waiting with no end.

190
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,903
Keep solving your mystery
and hang in there patiently.

191
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,073
See you around.

192
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,993
It's so relaxing here.

193
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,804
EUNSANG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

194
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,817
-Eat your meals and exercise, too.
-Okay.

195
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,196
The boy is Dr. Cha's patient, right?

196
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,704
His operation was delayed
due to the chairman's surgery.

197
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,081
During that time,
pulmonary stenosis set in.

198
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:37,668
His liver has deteriorated
and he has pleural effusion.

199
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,837
Then he needs surgery right away.
Why is nothing being done?

200
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,465
Well, the other doctors say
they can't operate on him.

201
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,552
Then you can do it, Dr. Ahn.

202
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:47,928
You're a skilled surgeon.

203
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,056
Well…

204
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,558
Aren't you at that level yet?

205
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,310
Nothing we can do then.

206
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,021
Make arrangements to transfer him
to another hospital then.

207
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,865
It's just as you said.

208
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,379
Oh Seung-jo, seven years old.

209
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,464
Suffers from atresia
of the pulmonary artery.

210
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:26,300
Has ventricular septal defect.
Received BT shunt at three weeks old.

211
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,843
Performed Rastelli procedure.

212
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,303
Stenosis in the right
ventricle-endotracheal tube.

213
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,096
Corrective surgery
is scheduled in two days.

214
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,433
Check his Echo and monitor the NPO time
and Electro tomorrow.

215
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,938
Don't touch the doctor like that.

216
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,407
I don't like him.

217
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,829
You're a good judge of people.

218
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,626
You don't like him, right?

219
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,211
He looks down on his patients.

220
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,004
Then think about it.

221
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,715
Do you need a doctor like him
to operate on you?

222
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,717
It's not too late to find someone else.

223
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,971
You're at the age
where you can choose your doctor.

224
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,114
My gosh.

225
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,787
When I was an intern
we didn't have beds like these.

226
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,080
Times have changed.

227
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,374
I'm not going anywhere anyway.

228
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,502
I guess I'll stay here, Seung-tak.

229
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,221
Seung-tak!

230
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,149
Patient is in his forties.

231
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:08,444
He fell from over 3m and pierced his chest
at a construction site.

232
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,029
Current blood pressure is 90.
Pulse is 120.

233
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,535
Seung-tak. Intubate the patient.

234
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,720
You're a resident doctor.
How can you not know how to intubate?

235
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,724
You're an embarrassment
to the cardiology department.

236
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,476
Hey, punk.

237
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,853
First, extend the patient's neck.

238
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,021
Use the laryngoscope

239
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,356
to press down on his tongue
and guide the tube to the trachea.

240
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,525
The voicebox needs to be opened
to clear the airway.

241
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,239
He'll go into cardiac arrest at this rate.

242
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,075
You imbecile. Move it.

243
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,246
This punk. He can't even handle
this procedure?

244
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,749
He doesn't know the basics.

245
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,630
See that?

246
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,132
That's how you perform an intubation.

247
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,094
Well done.

248
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,930
Of course. I'm the best.

249
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,560
Did he do that on purpose?

250
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:28,565
He patted himself on the back, right?
For a simple intubation.

251
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,692
Let go of me! That hurts.

252
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,486
-Please be quiet.
-I said let go.

253
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,571
-Do you know who I am?
-Calm down, sir. Just go in.

254
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,615
You can't act like that in the hospital.

255
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,118
Hey, who are you?

256
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,953
Do you know who I am, sir?

257
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:44,665
How would I know who you are?

258
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,083
-Let go of him.
-Sir, let go of the doctor!

259
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,960
Excuse me. Are you around?

260
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,253
-Don't grab the doctor.
-Hey.

261
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,963
Sir, let go of him.

262
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,714
-I'm not here.
-Stop it. Let go of him.

263
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,550
You think I'm stupid?

264
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,926
You can't fool me twice.

265
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,012
Keep pulling his hair. Harder.

266
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,305
You're doing great.

267
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,978
-Are you okay, sir?
-Sir? Are you okay?

268
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,646
-What's happening to him?
-Sir!

269
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,815
-Sir!
-Doctor, we need your help.

270
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,275
Darn it.

271
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:12,901
Help, Nurse.

272
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,653
Could you take a look at him?

273
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,449
It's a myocardial infarction.

274
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,118
He needs to be intubated.
Get the ECMO ready. Now.

275
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:29,585
Why does he keep entering his body
and letting Seung-tak use his skills?

276
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,669
Because he's a doctor.

277
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,754
What?

278
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,510
The person in front of him is a patient

279
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,679
and he is a doctor.

280
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,865
Where is he? Why isn't he back yet?

281
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,412
When I was a resident,
I had no time for breaks.

282
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:08,665
There was hardly any time.

283
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:09,875
Charge. 200 joules.

284
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,213
Move it.

285
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,297
Shot.

286
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,013
Charge. 200 joules.

287
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,516
It's ready, Doctor.

288
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,394
Move it. Shot.

289
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:02,386
When your body dies,
your soul will depart.

290
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:08,892
That's the law of nature
and the way of the heavens.

291
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,979
Why do people cling to life?

292
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:14,815
There are people…

293
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,944
in between this world and the afterworld.

294
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,250
What?

295
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,294
Why did he look at us like that?

296
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,379
Does he pity us?

297
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,092
-What?
-Tell me about it.

298
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,304
Why couldn't he have been
compassionate before?

299
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,471
But…

300
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,558
what is he doing back here?

301
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,103
They moved my body without telling anyone?

302
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,105
You didn't even know your body was moved?

303
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,274
Where were you?

304
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,992
CHA YOUNG-***
PRIMARY PHYSICIAN DR. JANG SE-JIN

305
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,937
The room is kind of bare, isn't it?

306
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,274
Just wait a little. Let me see.

307
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,444
Where should I start?

308
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:52,788
Han Seung-won.

309
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:54,623
What are you doing here?

310
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,668
Is the room to your liking?

311
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,005
It's a nice room

312
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:03,715
with lots of sunlight.

313
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,802
Thank you for this room
when you don't have many spare beds.

314
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,386
We should be thanking you.

315
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:12,057
On behalf of the hospital,
I thank you for making a bold decision.

316
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,812
I should've paid
special attention to Dr. Cha

317
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,231
but I've been busy.

318
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,733
You have the nerve to say that.

319
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,193
I know.

320
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,655
My dad's situation is a big matter here.

321
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:31,326
I've assigned Nurse Jung
to Dr. Cha's care as you requested.

322
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:35,080
If there's anything else you need,
just tell me.

323
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:38,583
You haven't changed a bit.

324
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,753
You're always polite.

325
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,057
How do you know her?

326
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,767
How do you know Se-jin?

327
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,942
You better not harm her in any way.

328
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:07,904
Or I'll kill you.

329
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:27,299
You made me wait after asking to see me.
I'm really busy. That's rude.

330
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,470
We're at work.

331
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,307
Be professional.

332
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,313
What? Something bothering you?

333
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:44,232
You get easily irritated
when there's something on your mind.

334
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:49,404
I called you so that you can rest
from working at ER.

335
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,784
Want some tea?

336
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:55,911
No thanks.

337
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,329
Do you have any snacks?

338
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,288
I'm hungry.

339
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,340
Seung-tak, you know…

340
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,676
You keep surprising me lately.

341
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,137
Me? How?

342
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,431
What did I do lately that surprised you?

343
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,685
Well, you performed surgery
on Dr. Cha that time.

344
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,354
And about Chairman Jang…

345
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,106
Why didn't you tell me?

346
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:26,858
The chairman?

347
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,819
The conference, you mean?

348
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,280
I didn't know that the conference
was about him.

349
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,115
If you had asked, I would've told you.

350
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,829
Did I say something I shouldn't have?

351
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,171
Why were you wheeling Dr. Cha's bed
around the hospital?

352
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,674
I almost forgot.
You ordered his transfer, right?

353
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,176
I thought Dr. Ban had given the order.

354
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,805
In any case, it ended well.
Dr. Cha now has a guardian.

355
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,727
I've got a call.
I'll take a rain check on the snacks.

356
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:03,895
Seung-tak.

357
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,899
I moved Dr. Cha to a VIP room
since you care about him.

358
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:11,528
I don't care about him.
Guess I won't be seeing him anymore.

359
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,363
Thanks for the break.

360
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,625
Seung-tak, tell me what's going on.

361
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,004
What's your plan?

362
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,841
Dr. Cha has his own place now.

363
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,094
Maybe things will be quieter around here.

364
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,639
-Put the books over there, please.
-Okay.

365
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,559
And the boxes next to the desk. Thank you.

366
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:43,935
That goes next to the table.

367
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,912
I'll have to get blackout curtains.

368
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,631
What is all of this?

369
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:14,716
Hello.

370
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,053
Until I can find a caregiver,
I think I'll have to be by his side.

371
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,848
-You set up the room like a living space.
-What?

372
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,976
Don't be silly.

373
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,438
My office is far away,
so commuting is tough.

374
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:33,318
Technically, I moved
into his patient's room.

375
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:50,543
Who is it?

376
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:53,546
Hi there.

377
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,299
What? Hey, what's going on?

378
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,884
Something happened.

379
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,553
So I decided to live here.

380
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:03,056
What are you talking about?

381
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,891
You have your own place.
Why would you live here?

382
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,894
Going back and forth is exhausting.
So this will save time.

383
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,939
Technically, I'm crashing at your place.

384
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,149
I'll pay half of the bill, okay?

385
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:16,694
That's absurd. No way.
Let's go. I'll take you home.

386
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:17,946
Hey.

387
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,031
We'll live together once we get married.

388
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,783
Can't we start a bit sooner?

389
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,536
No. It's not right.

390
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,037
So you need to go home.
I'll take you home.

391
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,915
At this late hour?
There's no public transport.

392
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:30,875
There are cabs.

393
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:35,922
I didn't have supper yet.

394
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,674
What? You didn't have supper?

395
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,259
That's not good.

396
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:46,975
How could you
not have anything to eat until now?

397
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:50,228
How many times have I told you?
Don't skip a meal.

398
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:53,565
And who forgets to eat their supper?
I don't understand.

399
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:56,568
There were so many times
I had to remind you to eat your meals.

400
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,445
I can't keep doing this anymore.

401
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:01,573
You never listen.

402
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:04,826
It's so nice.

403
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:06,911
You know…

404
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,956
I'll fix you supper and that's it.
Nothing else is happening.

405
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,666
I made myself clear.

406
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,709
Nothing else?

407
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,337
-What else is there?
-No sleeping.

408
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,256
You can't move in with me.

409
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,340
That can't happen.

410
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:25,054
Young-min, let's live together one day.
And let's set up our own clinic.

411
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,806
You'll be a heart surgeon,
and I'll be a neurosurgeon.

412
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,558
What do you think? Marvelous, right?

413
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,233
I'll redo all his tests starting tomorrow.

414
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,822
Give him these medicines
in this order starting tomorrow.

415
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:43,782
What else?

416
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,325
And check his blood pressure.

417
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:48,995
Why are you doing this now?

418
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,542
What's the idea?

419
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:04,719
Keep going.

420
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:11,976
What? Hey Seung-tak.

421
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,645
Why are you at work so early?

422
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,230
Can't you see?

423
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,523
I'm exercising.

424
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,316
But you don't like sweating.

425
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,777
Heart surgeons need stamina.
Don't you know that?

426
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:22,695
You probably don't.

427
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,156
It's common knowledge
in the medical world.

428
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,287
Hello?

429
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,748
Yes, Cheonmyung shares.

430
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,124
You sold all of the shares?

431
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,126
Buy them back immediately.

432
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,963
Already? News travels fast.

433
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,297
Buy whatever you can.

434
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,715
Every share.

435
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,093
Buy it now because it'll go up.

436
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:46,469
EUNSANG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

437
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,503
CHEONMYUNG GROUP CHAIRMAN
WAKES UP FROM COMA

438
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,387
CHEONMYUNG GROUP CHAIRMAN
WAKES UP FROM COMA

439
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,600
-Hey, is that his car?
-He's here!

440
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,934
-Hurry!
-Hurry up!

441
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,686
Take photos.

442
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,521
He's coming out.

443
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,148
-Sir, it won't take long.
-Hold on.

444
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,942
Just a moment.

445
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:46,696
The chairman has woken up from his coma.
Is that true?

446
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:50,491
Thanks to all of your support
and best wishes, he has woken up.

447
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,493
Will he have a full recovery?

448
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,621
I believe he will although we'll have to
check his condition.

449
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,331
Will you succeed him as the chairman?

450
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,707
Rumor has it that someone else
is in the running.

451
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,751
My dad's recovery is paramount.

452
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,420
-That'll be all.
-Sir!

453
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,172
-Is it that true…
-Please, a word.

454
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,132
-Sir!
-Hold on!

455
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,009
Could you tell us
when he'll be discharged?

456
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,932
Hey!

457
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,894
Thank you for calling, sir.

458
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,604
Yes, sure.

459
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,525
He can't have any visitors yet.

460
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,486
I will tell my dad that you called.

461
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,613
Yes, sir.

462
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,616
You're here again?

463
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,285
I heard that dad has woken up.
Let me see him.

464
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,621
Did you not hear what I just said?

465
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,289
No visitors are allowed.

466
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,582
Dad said so.

467
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,584
He doesn't want to see anyone yet.

468
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:45,463
Are you now a doctor here?

469
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,966
You're a skilled professional.

470
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,884
I guess you don't have to
worry about making a living.

471
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,469
You don't need my help either.

472
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,354
You're not allowed in.

473
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:18,496
Sir?

474
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:19,914
What's going on?

475
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,249
The articles said you were…

476
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:25,003
Must have been strenuous to be
in a wheelchair yesterday.

477
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,257
The bodyguards probably had a hard time.

478
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,259
You are quite heavy, Dad.

479
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:36,472
I'm so happy

480
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,684
that you've woken up from your coma.

481
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,647
Now you just need to recover fully.

482
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,483
Very slowly.

483
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:54,824
You son of a…

484
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,838
All right, sir.

485
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,468
Dr. Ahn, did you hear the news?

486
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,680
Are you going to check the chairman?

487
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:20,099
I knew you'd double-check, Dr. Ahn.

488
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,226
But that's not the way
to the chairman's room.

489
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,186
Dr. Ahn.

490
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,441
"Administrative Director's Office"?

491
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,364
Mr. Han gave the order.
They're in it together.

492
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:38,618
You're…

493
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,373
Of course, not.

494
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,210
I told you I believe in you.

495
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,003
You made the right decision.

496
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,254
That's your guy.

497
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,547
Go in.

498
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,725
This is outrageous.

499
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,853
So he's here, too. I ought to…

500
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,189
Don't hesitate. Just give it to them.

501
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,233
If they say no, tell them
you'll see the chairman yourself.

502
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,276
Tell them he's your patient.
You're his doctor!

503
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,444
Why aren't you saying anything? Come on.

504
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:14,946
Come in.

505
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:18,199
He's the heart surgeon I told you about.

506
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,332
I'm Dr. Ahn Tae-hyun.

507
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,594
He was our starting pitcher for this plan?

508
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,139
I heard what you did. You did great.

509
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,437
Not really.

510
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:53,317
Well, things got unexpectedly complicated.

511
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:57,446
But I'm sure Mr. Han
will figure out a plan for that.

512
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,157
So Dr. Ahn will be in charge
of the chairman

513
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,784
as his primary care physician.

514
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:03,744
Really?

515
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,246
All you need to do

516
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:08,207
is keep my dad's pulse beating regularly.

517
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,334
For at least one year
and no more than that.

518
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,504
I've got a lot to do during that time.

519
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,089
Okay.

520
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,591
I'll do my best.

521
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,676
Dr. Ahn.

522
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,512
How could you?

523
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:36,944
It was you?

524
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:38,905
You did it?

525
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,656
Dr. Ahn?

526
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,200
You piece of crap.

527
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,410
Why would you though?

528
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,621
How could you do something like this?

529
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:51,959
I trusted you the most.
How could you betray me like this?

530
00:36:57,173 --> 00:37:00,384
How could you do this

531
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:01,844
to me?

532
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:09,518
How dare you come here?
What are you doing in my office?

533
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,451
Why didn't you…

534
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,332
listen to me…

535
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,544
when I told you not to do the operation?

536
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,299
But do you have to do this surgery?

537
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,217
Don't worry.

538
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:44,136
If we do an autotransplantation,
we've got a chance.

539
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,722
But this is a risky operation.
And the tumor will likely regrow.

540
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:50,268
Doctor, you usually
turn down operations like this.

541
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,272
You overreached. It's your fault.

542
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:58,985
Don't blame me for this.

543
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,112
Were you…

544
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,950
already a part of the plan?

545
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:09,370
But I upheld your reputation, Doctor.

546
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:11,998
The articles say…

547
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,086
the chairman woke up from his coma.

548
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,596
Why did you have to create this mess

549
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:32,393
by trying to save a man
who was going to die anyway?

550
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,694
When did you learn the truth?

551
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,198
It was one of my men who did this.

552
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,160
I'm deeply sorry.

553
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:53,873
I can't blame you
when I raised a son like that.

554
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,586
I'll reveal the truth somehow

555
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,880
to fix this injustice.

556
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,175
I'll uncover it no matter what.

557
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,385
You don't know how to play Go, do you?

558
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,553
What?

559
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,930
My son is giving me one year.

560
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:13,100
I think I'll play Go to pass the time.

561
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:18,189
But it's boring playing by myself.

562
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:31,786
Teach me that trick.

563
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:52,556
You don't even know how to do this?
It's so easy.

564
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,974
My goodness.

565
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:56,477
Try it.

566
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,694
Oh, boy. Look and learn.

567
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:10,199
So it won't open if you think
you're a ghost and will it to open.

568
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:13,702
You have to relax. Be natural.
So press it without even thinking.

569
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:17,164
You don't think
when you press the button. Right?

570
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,129
There you go.

571
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,131
It worked! See that?

572
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:26,799
Naturally.

573
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,764
Tell him to change his clothes first.

574
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,642
How long has he worn that? He's smelly.

575
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,853
Do I smell?

576
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,025
Ghosts don't smell.

577
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,486
Maybe it's your character.

578
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:52,533
You used to wear sharp suits all the time.

579
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,618
But now your fashion sense is….

580
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,456
You were quite a dashing doctor.

581
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,082
People would stare at you
when you'd walk by.

582
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,086
What are you saying?

583
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,296
I've still got it.

584
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:07,882
The best way

585
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:11,760
is to pick someone
who wears a similar style to yours.

586
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,847
Then you don't need to decide
what to wear every morning.

587
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:19,477
Tess is really good at picking people
who dress smartly.

588
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:24,565
He cares a lot
about wearing the latest fashion.

589
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,494
What? That's my suit you're wearing.

590
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:38,913
How do I look?

591
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,832
Looks good on me, doesn't it?

592
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,173
I got that.

593
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:52,092
Are there any other tricks?
Like hitting someone?

594
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,427
Can you punch someone?

595
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:57,723
Why do you ask?

596
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:00,017
Are you afraid of getting beaten up by me?

597
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,227
Get beaten up?

598
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,480
No, I'm not scared.

599
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,524
That young doctor can help you with that.

600
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:07,691
Why are you asking us?

601
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,246
Dr. Ahn, get up.

602
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,008
Seung-tak?

603
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,346
Do I look like Seung-tak to you?

604
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:43,852
I'm…

605
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:45,312
Cha Young-min.

606
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,691
You weren't hired because you
graduated from a no-name college.

607
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,234
I reversed that decision
based on your grit.

608
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:51,819
You made a critical mistake
in your second year.

609
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:54,446
If I hadn't spotted your blunder,
the patient would've died.

610
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,532
Besides that, I saved your butt
so many times.

611
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:58,742
If it weren't for me,
you wouldn't be a heart surgeon.

612
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,869
I'm the one who made your career,
you punk.

613
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,583
But you betrayed me!

614
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,252
How could you do something like that?

615
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:09,670
What the hell?

616
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:11,297
Are you crazy?

617
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:16,885
What?

618
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,053
You upheld my reputation for me?

619
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,180
The surgery was a success.

620
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,266
I saved someone
who had a high chance of dying.

621
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,685
But you killed him. You're a murderer.

622
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,020
Reveal what you did.

623
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:29,231
Otherwise, you'll suffer
from nightmares every night.

624
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,775
Mark my words. I'll be watching you.

625
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:05,851
What was that?

626
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,728
What the hell was that?

627
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:11,690
What was it that you
said just now, you punk?

628
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,484
How could you know all that?

629
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,069
Were you dreaming?

630
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:18,822
Did I appear in your dream?

631
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,034
What?

632
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:23,786
What did I say to you in your dream?

633
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,621
I guess it wasn't something nice.

634
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:28,874
Well…

635
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,293
You look fully awake.

636
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,545
How about you take over my night shift?

637
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,398
What are you doing here?
You said you were going home.

638
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,901
-What?
-That's my coat.

639
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,112
I was going to have that washed.

640
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,373
Scared?

641
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:10,916
That was nothing.

642
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:13,293
This is just the beginning.

643
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,129
Be prepared, you piece of crap.

644
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,300
How would you know?

645
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,302
I put so much effort into that operation.

646
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,555
Do you know how much that meant to me?

647
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:25,764
You traitor.

648
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,204
You know who I am, right?

649
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,880
Could you rewind that?

650
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,299
That's all there is.

651
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:11,768
Unbelievable.

652
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,353
He thinks he's a ghost now?

653
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,272
He's scaring people in their sleep.
It's so old-fashioned.

654
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,024
Why didn't he bring my car back?

655
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,151
Fine then.

656
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,319
Let's go get your car.

657
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:18,335
I made it.

658
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,677
Mandu!

659
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:28,387
Cha Mandu!

660
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:31,974
What?

661
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:32,891
Cha Mandu.

662
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:36,853
Where is my baby?

663
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:45,862
Dr. Koh?

664
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,459
Dr. Koh.

665
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:01,837
Kim…

666
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:03,589
I mean, Dr. Jang.

667
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,134
What brings you here, Doctor?

668
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:10,304
Dr. Cha hasn’t been home for a while,
so I came to check.

669
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,888
I got his address from Nurse Jung.

670
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,808
Have you been here before?

671
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:16,602
No, it's my first time.

672
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:20,063
But what are you doing here, Dr. Koh?

673
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,732
The same reason you came.

674
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:27,446
I didn't know you were close to Dr. Cha.

675
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:28,530
-We're not on good terms.
-We're not on good terms.

676
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,157
-He doesn't like me.
-Very much.

677
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,241
Well, I mean…

678
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,246
You won't change your mind about that?

679
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,082
Dr. Cha's condition

680
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,918
isn't good.

681
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:49,593
I compared his past diffusion MRI result
with a recent one.

682
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:53,430
There's a signal intensity spike here.

683
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,390
Activity in his thalamus has spread.

684
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,643
And also his ganglion.

685
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,109
So…

686
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,446
his condition is deteriorating.

687
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:12,574
His vitals are stable and also his reps.

688
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:16,453
There seems to be something
inflicting damage to his brain.

689
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,289
But I don't see what could be causing it.

690
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,379
If you keep doing that
just because you can,

691
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,297
you might never wake up from your coma.

692
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:34,596
Then do as you please.

693
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,015
Your life is hanging in the balance

694
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,850
but I can't stop you.

695
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,407
Dr. Koh.

696
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,415
What a nice

697
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:03,750
room.

698
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,712
It's spacious and well-lit.

699
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:19,224
I think you had a good time.
I'll be going then.

700
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:21,309
But…

701
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:25,564
what's that?

702
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,781
Well, you see. Those are…
While I was alive, those…

703
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,032
That's not it.

704
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,702
I don't like wearing
other people's clothes.

705
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:41,329
So it's hard to find someone
in this hospital who has good fashion.

706
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:44,499
Guess he can't wear shabby clothes
even in a coma.

707
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:45,709
And has to wear new suits.

708
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:48,211
That's not true. You don't even know me.

709
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,423
No. She can't open that. Stop her.

710
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:52,591
Don't let her see what's inside.

711
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,301
You'll be very embarrassed
if she sees that.

712
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,803
No. Gosh. She saw it.

713
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,972
She saw it.

714
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:05,437
Come on.

715
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,231
Are you accusing me
of trying to steal his bank account?

716
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,276
You know who I am, right?
My family is wealthy.

717
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,235
Let me…

718
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:16,490
This is a Black card.
It's only for one-percenters.

719
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,575
Why would I steal from him?

720
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:23,455
This isn't how I wanted to give it to you.
The hospital can be expensive.

721
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:27,417
I guess I brought that
so that you could pay his medical bill.

722
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:32,214
Wait a minute. Do you know it's me?

723
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,256
Dr. Cha…

724
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,842
has been sleeping for too long.

725
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:45,644
So…

726
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:49,481
he entered my body
so that he could visit his home?

727
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,368
I mean,

728
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,745
why didn't he use public transportation?

729
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:06,039
My car isn't his.
He should have brought it back.

730
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,124
Damn him.

731
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:12,420
He's been pretending until now.

732
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,008
What's going on between us?

733
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:26,935
Young-min, you wear burgundy red suits?

734
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,233
You've developed some fashion sense.

735
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:38,488
You wouldn't wear suits
when I asked you to.

736
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:45,412
Why is this so expensive?

737
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:46,788
Young-min, try this on.

738
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:50,667
I don't need any.
Just buy one for yourself.

739
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,420
No. Today, we're going
to buy your clothes.

740
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,505
Don’t you get sick and tired
of wearing the same outfit?

741
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:57,007
You've been wearing that for years.

742
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,342
I bought these clothes last year.

743
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,428
Yes, in a different color.
You think I didn't notice?

744
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:05,390
You always wear a hoodie with jeans. Gosh.

745
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:07,976
Hey.

746
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:11,104
How could you wear that outfit
to our professor's wedding?

747
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:12,939
People were talking about you
behind your back.

748
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,357
They called you a fashion terrorist.

749
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:15,859
Clothes don't matter.

750
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:18,111
As long as your clothes
are clean and well-kept.

751
00:53:18,194 --> 00:53:20,113
-No thanks. I like these.
-No!

752
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:24,034
Young-min, you're a handsome guy
but wear ugly clothes.

753
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,952
That's a waste of talent.

754
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,872
I want my boyfriend
to undergo a style transformation.

755
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:31,708
Let's see…

756
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,046
Hey!

757
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:42,093
I said we're buying your clothes! Come on!

758
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:53,396
I want you to wear different clothes!

759
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,648
-Come on.
-Come back here!

760
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:03,949
Young-min.

761
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:07,827
Did I come here…

762
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,874
to let you die…

763
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:17,462
or save your life?

764
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:23,843
Maybe, I shouldn't have come back.

765
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:27,263
If I hadn't…

766
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:30,475
then you…

767
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,395
and my dad…

768
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,107
might be all right.

769
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:44,614
It's my fault.

770
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:48,284
I shouldn't have come.

771
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,459
Young-min.

772
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:01,631
Don't let me be the one
to announce your time of death.

773
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,553
Please don't make me do that.

774
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:15,437
I know there's something going on
in this hospital.

775
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,272
But you need to wake up first.

776
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:18,648
That way, we can solve this.

777
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,569
Clear up the problems.

778
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:25,780
And think about us.

779
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:33,079
So don't be distracted by other thoughts.

780
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,707
Just focus on getting better.

781
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,919
I'm going to save you no matter what.

782
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,922
So be strong for me.

783
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,092
You will, right?

784
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,686
EUNSANG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

785
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:00,065
Hey.

786
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:11,076
He's dressed differently today
after moving to a VIP room.

787
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:12,869
He's still got it.

788
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,208
He's so cool.

789
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:21,711
No way. He's a ghost.
Nobody can see him anyway.

790
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,427
Here's your Iced Americano.

791
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:31,930
Thank you.

792
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,102
That hit the spot.

793
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:40,730
They brew great Americano.

794
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:53,910
What's he doing?

795
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:57,539
One Iced Americano.

796
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:00,500
-Okay.
-Why is he acting like that?

797
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,045
He wants to live. That's why.

798
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:05,130
What?

799
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:09,801
What?

800
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:10,760
Hey.

801
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:12,011
What's that black figure?

802
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,429
I've never seen him before.

803
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:14,848
Is it a new ghost?

804
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,141
Who is he

805
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,226
staring at?

806
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:36,161
I thought he had changed his ways.

807
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,663
There's going to be trouble soon.

808
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,010
911 RESCUE

809
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:06,399
He crashed into a tree on a slippery road.
He suffered trauma to his chest.

810
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:07,734
What about his vitals?

811
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:09,068
They're normal.

812
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:16,910
-Did you call cardiology?
-What? We've got Seung-tak.

813
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,872
Can't you see how serious it is?
Page another doctor.

814
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:22,248
Okay.

815
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:24,918
Doctor.

816
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,544
Where is my husband?

817
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:28,588
Doctor, please save him.

818
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:29,506
My husband.

819
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:30,673
Over there.

820
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:40,183
It's clearly a tamponade.

821
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:42,018
You can't handle this case.

822
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:45,855
Why did they page him?

823
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,108
What the…

824
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,443
Two times one is two.
Two times two is four.

825
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,819
Two times three is six. I'll stay calm.

826
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,363
Echocardiograph.

827
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:00,870
How did you hurt your hand?

828
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:06,209
I fell down the stairs and sprained it.

829
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:11,673
It's tamponade.

830
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:16,261
It's on the RV side.

831
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,889
Should we move him to the operating room?

832
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:25,103
I can't operate like this.

833
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:27,897
Should I page another doctor?

834
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,399
They're all attending a symposium today.

835
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:31,734
What should we do?

836
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:36,614
Seung-tak.

837
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:40,285
Do you want to give it a go?

838
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:45,999
Are you crazy? How can
a first-year resident handle this surgery?

839
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,168
It's similar to Dr. Cha's case.

840
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:51,963
You did it once.

841
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,132
I'll be at your side.

842
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:55,800
So you be the lead on this one.

843
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:58,845
What is it?

844
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,764
-Can't you do it?
-Of course, he can't.

845
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:04,017
Even a four-year resident would
find it difficult so how could he?

846
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,685
You don't know his skills?

847
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:07,895
We have no choice then.

848
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,398
Transfer him to another hospital.

849
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:11,774
Ask them if they can handle

850
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,109
-a tamponade patient.
-What?

851
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:14,777
Okay.

852
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:17,280
But will the patient be okay until then?

853
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:18,364
We have no choice.

854
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:21,367
-Find a hospital quickly.
-Okay.

855
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,420
Who are you looking at?

856
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:35,173
I know how you feel about this.

857
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:37,133
We're talking about open-heart surgery.

858
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:39,177
This is different
from an emergency first-aid.

859
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:41,346
I'll do the surgery.

860
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,223
Are you mad?

861
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:48,353
Please move the patient
to the operating room.

862
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:51,105
Hey, Seung-tak!

863
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:52,231
Seung-tak!

864
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:54,400
Forget it.

865
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:03,409
You know who I am, right?

866
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,330
If you thought I'd help,

867
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:08,498
you better stop now.

868
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:11,417
How do you even know if I'm here or not?

869
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:14,170
Anyway, I'm not helping this time.

870
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:17,006
I can't possess you anymore,
so cancel the surgery right now.

871
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:19,634
Hey.

872
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:23,221
I know it'll hurt your pride.

873
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:24,889
But that's none of my business.

874
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,309
Yes, the patient might not make it.

875
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:31,020
But I can't care about
other people's lives right now.

876
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:33,439
He can't even hear me.

877
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:37,026
Anyway, you took this on.
So it's your problem.

878
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:41,823
I'm heading to my room.
Why did I come to the ER?

879
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,926
Dr. Ahn will intervene if things go south.

880
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:05,596
I assigned Seung-tak
to perform the operation.

881
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,683
It so happens

882
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:11,686
the patient has tamponade
like Dr. Cha did.

883
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,440
You can come to Room 7.

884
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,359
EUNSANG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

885
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:40,757
Seung-tak.

886
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:42,592
What's wrong?

887
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:44,469
Don't you have an appetite?

888
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:47,555
You don't do much work at the hospital.

889
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:49,098
So why do you look so tired?

890
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:51,309
What do you mean?

891
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:54,604
He's handling half of the patients
who come to ER.

892
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:00,443
Now that's a surprise.

893
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:02,236
You hardly ever compliment Seung-tak.

894
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:04,781
Are you sure about that though?

895
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:07,450
Do you think I don't know
because I'm semi-retired?

896
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:09,869
Is that true, Seung-tak?

897
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:13,122
You handle half the patients in ER?

898
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,293
Dear Grandpa.

899
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,545
I wouldn't say I handle half of them.

900
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:21,714
More like

901
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:23,883
one-sixteenth of the patients.

902
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:07,885
It's not too late to back out.
Tell them you can't do it.

903
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:10,930
I don't know why they're doing this
but they're setting you up.

904
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:12,348
So tell them you can't do it.

905
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:15,977
You dirty bastards.

906
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:19,021
How could you play with a patient's life?

907
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:21,899
A patient isn't a pawn in your game.

908
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:28,656
Scalpel.

909
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:30,867
What are you doing?
Are you really doing it?

910
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:38,082
How could you not know
how to properly hold a scalpel?

911
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:39,917
You hold it like holding a pencil.

912
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:42,712
A bit lower.

913
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:47,091
Your index finger goes there.
Near the edge.

914
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:48,134
Good.

915
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:51,095
What?

916
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:54,181
Can you hear my voice?

917
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:14,911
Let's save the patient first.

918
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:21,417
Dr. Cha Young-min.

919
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:50,571
Please.

920
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:51,697
Please.

921
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:24,063
All right.

922
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:27,316
Let's get started with the surgery.

923
01:07:13,654 --> 01:07:15,781
So that's why you've been using me?

924
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:17,408
You possess my body whenever you please.

925
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:18,701
You can't even use your fingers properly.

926
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:20,619
You can't even open your eyes.

927
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,872
I'll never possess you again.
I don't need you, you punk!

928
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:24,415
Don't even try entering my body.

929
01:07:24,498 --> 01:07:25,583
I'll smash your soul into pieces.

930
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:27,376
You were the lead surgeon.
So give the order.

931
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:28,586
Don't look at me. Are we friends now?

932
01:07:28,669 --> 01:07:29,545
Revenge is petty.

933
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:30,546
Did you expect it to be classy then?

934
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:31,714
Dr. Koh.

935
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:33,466
What are they thinking?

936
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,427
He'll never get a seat at the board.

937
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:38,721
-No, Se-jin…
-That wasn't me.

938
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:40,598
I'm not going to die like this.

939
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:47,772
