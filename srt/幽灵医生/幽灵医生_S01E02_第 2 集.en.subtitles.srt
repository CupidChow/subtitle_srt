1
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:34,701
NO VISITATION

2
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:43,710
Doctor.

3
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:45,712
That was incredible.

4
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:49,632
It was a complicated operation
but you did it flawlessly.

5
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,177
Shouldn't we publish this surgery
in a medical journal?

6
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,096
Because the patient is old,
it'll take more time for him to wake up.

7
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,307
There's a risk of tumor emboli.

8
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,144
Give him 500 units of heparin per hour
continuously for the next 24 hrs.

9
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,188
Okay, Doctor.

10
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:10,904
I'll stay and watch over him.
So please get some rest.

11
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,075
He hasn't woken up yet.
I'm not going anywhere.

12
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,086
Who could it be?

13
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,632
LET'S MEET UP. CAN YOU COME RIGHT NOW?

14
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:35,720
What's wrong?

15
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,307
What? It's nothing.

16
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,943
I'll be right back.
Stay by the patient's side.

17
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,611
Call me if there's any change
in his condition.

18
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,822
Sure, Doctor. Don't worry about a thing.

19
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,810
Why is he in such a hurry?

20
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,396
Did he do that on purpose to run me over?

21
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:29,482
That startled me.

22
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,070
Crystal.

23
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,031
I need time to recover
after seeing that patient.

24
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,785
-Jae-won?
-Yes, it's me, Seung-tak.

25
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:41,911
Are you busy?

26
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,667
Something came up so I need to ask you
for a favor. It's urgent.

27
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,903
VIP INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

LEE SUN-HO

29
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,217
-Yes?
-Doctor.

30
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,802
The patient's vitals are strange.

31
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,554
What are you talking about? How so?

32
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,974
His blood pressure is normal
but his heart rate went up.

33
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,228
Really? I'll be right there.
Keep monitoring the patient.

34
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,813
And report his condition.

35
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,831
LEE SUN-HO

36
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,584
Doctor, his blood pressure
is dropping too.

37
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,503
Do you think a suture has broken?

38
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:59,340
What are you talking about?
We checked that using ultrasound.

39
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,396
Keep him on the ECMO. I'll be there soon.

40
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,732
But where is Dr. Ahn?
Why are you calling instead?

41
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,567
I haven't been able to reach him.

42
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,280
What? Hang up.

43
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:00,985
What the hell?

44
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:24,634
All right.

45
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,324
Doctor, take a look at this.

46
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,702
Has the suture ruptured?

47
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:33,786
I think so.

48
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,787
He needs surgery.

49
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:36,205
Surgery?

50
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,041
Where's Dr. Cha?
You said he'd be here soon.

51
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,419
Hurry.

52
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,630
The number you have dialed--

53
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,382
-He's not answering.
-What?

54
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,890
VIP INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

55
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,022
Yes, Jae-won.

56
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,690
Hey, Seung-tak, where are you right now?

57
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,275
I'm at the ER, of course.

58
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,651
You know that thing I asked for…

59
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,737
I can't hear you.

60
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,738
What am I doing right now?

61
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:12,200
We just got a bunch of emergency patients.

62
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,706
What? They're really here.

63
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:20,875
Hey, Seung-tak.

64
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,211
Why is it so loud there?

65
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,338
Hey, Seung-tak.

66
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:31,052
Did you hear the siren? I'm not lying.

67
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,225
He's a TA patient.

68
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,268
He was on a motorcycle and hit a car.

69
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,604
This way.

70
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,232
It's a TA patient.

71
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,652
-I think it's a head injury.
-Did I ask? About the thing I…

72
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,199
Are you stupid? It's not my department.
It's neurosurgery.

73
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,160
There's another ambulance coming.

74
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,370
RESTRICTED ACCESS

75
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,626
Heard the siren?

76
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,836
I'm on call. Super busy.

77
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,506
No, not now. Seung-tak…

78

911 RESCUE

79
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,516
This is the driver
whose car crashed into the motorcycle.

80
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:22,603
Dr. Cha Young-min!

81
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,188
What? He's a doctor at this hospital?

82
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,023
Yes, this way. Hurry.

83
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,125
NAME: JANG GWANG-DEOK

84
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,126
Forget it.

85
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,217
Hold on. Take this.

86
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,262
I need an APTT test.
It's an emergency. Please, hurry.

87
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,395
Seung-tak.

88
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,441
Seung-tak.

89
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:13,738
Seung-tak.

90
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:18,993
Hey, Seung-tak.

91
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,298
I found it.

92
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,761
4-0 Prolene with tubing flange.

93
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,693
Why isn't he answering his phone?

94
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,372
Ms. Oh. Cut.

95
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,339
Good. Very good.

96
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,852
His blood pressure is normal
and his vitals have stabilized.

97
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,036
Seung-tak…

98
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,705
I mean, Dr. Koh. You saved Dr. Cha's life.

99
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,595
What? His blood pressure is falling
and his heart rate is going up.

100
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,555
What's going on?

101
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:04,932
There's a lot of blood.

102
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,131
RESTRICTED ACCESS
NEUROSURGERY STARTS HERE

103
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,600
There they are. Why aren't they
answering their phones?

104
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,518
Excuse me. What's the situation?

105
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,479
Where is Dr. Cha? Where is he?

106
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,440
He was brought in from a car accident.
He's in the operating room.

107
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,649
But we don't have any surgeons.

108
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:12,791
What's happening? What?

109
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,593
Do something, Dr. Koh!

110
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,438
You said there was one RV
in the ultrasound.

111
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,566
There could be another one! Look for it!

112
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,365
No.

113
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,035
I can't die like this.

114
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,747
No.

115
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:57,878
Se-jin.

116
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,356
Dr. Ahn, where were you?

117
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,733
We detected a tamponade.

118
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:23,529
Dr. Koh stopped the bleeding in the RV,
but there seems to be another one.

119
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,823
But he froze up all of a sudden.

120
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:26,866
Who did what?

121
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,993
Hey, are you crazy?

122
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,997
-How dare you operate on him?
-This isn't the time for that!

123
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,373
We're running out of time.

124
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,208
If you don't do
something quick, he'll die.

125
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,710
I'm ready.

126
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:38,878
Move it!

127
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,015
I think there's a rupture in the LV.

128
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,559
-Give me the pump.
-Okay.

129
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,565
Hurry and massage his heart.

130
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,007
EUNSANG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

131
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,967
Dr. Cha was in a car crash?

132
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,053
I just learned of it.
It was really hectic.

133
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,056
He was rushing back
to check on the chairman

134
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,098
and hit a motorcycle.

135
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,391
So he's in surgery right now.

136
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,603
Why did Dr. Cha leave the patient's side
before the patient woke up?

137
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:38,938
I don't know.

138
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:42,107
He doesn't report to me
about where he goes.

139
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,776
How could you be so lax?

140
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,071
-Don't you know who that patient is?
-I do.

141
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,197
I'm sorry.

142
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,201
I stabilized the chairman's condition
for now.

143
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,078
Who is operating on Dr. Cha?

144
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:57,414
Dr. Ahn went to the operating room.
He's probably finished by now.

145
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,707
Dr. Ahn?

146
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,084
Yes.

147
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,473
Why can't I get through this door?

148
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,272
All right.

149
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,985
I'm relieved that you came
in the nick of time, Dr. Ahn.

150
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,277
Good job.

151
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,655
Was the operation a success?

152
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:32,282
The operation was a success, right?

153
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,494
Dr. Cha will recover, right?

154
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,662
Of course, I will.

155
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:40,207
He might not look like it,
but he's a very skilled surgeon.

156
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,167
We don't know yet.

157
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,963
What? Was there some kind of problem?

158
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,965
The operation went well.

159
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,844
But we'll have to wait
and see if he wakes up.

160
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,141
-You mean…
-His blood pressure fell

161
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,726
for a prolonged time.

162
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,356
No.

163
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,527
This can't happen.

164
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,530
I have to get back into my body.

165
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,369
I have to get back in.

166
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,746
Please.

167
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,373
Please.

168
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,917
Please. I have to enter my body.

169
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,047
No.

170
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,466
I have to.

171
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,051
I want to live.

172
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:33,719
I have to live.

173
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,014
No.

174
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,266
I have to go back.

175
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,605
Seung-tak.

176
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,734
Is it true that Seung-tak
operated on him first?

177
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,570
Did you see him do that?

178
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,198
Yes.

179
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:56,909
That's impossible.

180
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,036
How could he have?

181
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,621
How could he perform a surgery?

182
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:01,955
That doesn't matter.

183
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,918
You…

184
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,713
Where were you? What took you so long?

185
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,548
He stopped the first rupture, right?

186
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,217
But why did he stop all of a sudden?

187
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,094
He looked like he was in a daze.

188
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,378
Eight times one is eight.
Eight times two is sixteen.

189
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,673
Eight times three is twenty-four.
Eight times four is thirty-two…

190
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,390
Don't let anyone know
what happened tonight with the chairman.

191
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,142
Keep it a secret for now.

192
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:08,897
Hey, Seung-tak.

193
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,483
I was looking for you everywhere.

194
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,236
Today was a series of shocking events.

195
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,779
But this was the most shocking.

196
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,823
Did you really operate on Dr. Cha?

197
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,200
You? By yourself? A tamponade?

198
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,829
Hey, are you there?

199
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,123
Did you really operate on him?

200
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,960
Yes, that's what they say.

201
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:31,587
They said so?

202
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:33,839
So, did you?

203
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,300
But…

204
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,012
I don't remember a thing.

205
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,390
You did operate on him.

206
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:46,268
I'm so jealous.
You did your first solo surgery.

207
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,022
I shouldn't be celebrating.

208
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,481
The patient was Dr. Cha.

209
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,363
What happened to him?

210
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,073
I can't believe this.

211
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:03,952
Hey.

212
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,247
That's how it is when you do
your first solo operation.

213
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,625
You're numb and your memory is fuzzy.

214
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,293
Afterward, you're in a daze.

215
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,549
Is that so?

216
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,302
I haven't done one so I don't know.

217
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,054
But that's what the others say.

218
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,934
Go see a psychiatrist
if you doubt your sanity.

219
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,477
You should've seen one earlier.

220
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,113
What was it that I saw earlier?

221
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:44,868
Shall we begin?

222
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,537
Ms. Oh. Stand in as my first.

223
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:49,539
It can't be.

224
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,612
It seems you're back to your old self.

225
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,282
Could you explain what happened?

226
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,450
Explain what?

227
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,333
I must have startled you.

228
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:38,588
I was trying to hide my skills
but somehow, I revealed them today.

229
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,674
Your skills?

230
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:43,510
I'm not the person you think I am.

231
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:46,680
I'm a bit of a genius, you see.

232
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,349
I deceived you, didn't I?

233
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,810
So you're a genius?

234
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,146
I was hiding my skills
because I didn't want to work.

235
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,148
I'd get more work
if the doctors found out.

236
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:02,321
I was planning to use my connections
to have an easy four-year residency.

237
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,656
Why would I push myself?

238
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,825
You were hiding your talent?

239
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,118
Speaking of which…

240
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,786
Could I ask you a favor?

241
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,414
Don't tell anyone what you saw earlier.

242
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,669
That depends on your actions.

243
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,381
What actions?

244
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:23,675
I'll figure it out soon.

245
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,343
Whether you're a genius

246
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,471
or there's something else.

247
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:32,684
Dr. Cha is hospitalized,
so I'm heading home.

248
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,937
Watch over him tonight.
Call me when he wakes up.

249
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,077
Dr. Ban says
the next six hours are critical.

250
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,245
We'll find out tomorrow.

251
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,537
Focus.

252
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,455
Let's focus now.

253
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:49,261
Damn it.

254
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,346
The patient care in the ICU is awful!

255
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,431
The tube is disconnected.

256
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:56,560
How many times have I told you
to check the connectors?

257
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,782
I said not there, you punk!

258
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,545
Do you want to die?

259
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,382
What?

260
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:33,263
I told you not to litter.

261
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:37,267
-What's wrong with you?
-I'm sorry.

262
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,727
-You can go.
-Okay.

263
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:44,566
He's well-groomed,
but he doesn't care about cleanliness.

264
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,284
Satisfied?

265
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,621
Don't get so upset
over something so trivial.

266
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,168
Wait. Lady.

267
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,586
Excuse me, ma'am.

268
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,545
Ma'am.

269
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,011
Where am I?

270
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,764
Oh, gosh. What's happening to me?

271
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:23,063
What? That's my suit you're wearing.

272
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:25,357
How do I look?

273
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,403
Looks good on me, doesn't it?
It fits me perfectly.

274
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,530
I can wear this through winter.

275
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:36,117
Is that a new arrival?
Limited edition suit?

276
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,160
Or is it a knock-off?

277
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:40,038
Hey, suits are the least of your worries.

278
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,208
You possessed someone's body
in the operating room.

279
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,544
That's going to spell your doom.

280
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,839
A coma ghost

281
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,635
can't return to their own body
if they possess someone else's.

282
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,886
Did you not know?

283
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:56,888
What ghost?

284
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,349
It's a medical term. "Coma."

285
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,811
A ghost that might or might not live.

286
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:03,937
A ghost?

287
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,355
Then am I a ghost?

288
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:08,441
Why are you so surprised?
It's obvious, isn't it?

289
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:13,029
Well, maybe you don't get it
since you're still in shock.

290
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,240
Let me spell it out for you.

291
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:21,955
A coma ghost. You get it now, don't you?

292
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,415
Are you a ghost, too?

293
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,542
The name is Socrates.

294
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,048
That's my name.

295
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:35,802
Or call me Tess.

296
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,095
Gramps. You are…

297
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,222
How dare you.

298
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,725
-Call me Tess.
-So Tess,

299
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:45,020
how were you able to possess her?
I saw you come out of her body.

300
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,648
I'm just a regular ghost.

301
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:49,941
A spirit of someone who died.

302
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:55,780
I possessed another person
in the operating room.

303
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:56,781
How was that possible?

304
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,658
I don't know.

305
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:02,912
A coma ghost can't possess
a person's body.

306
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,415
But you did it somehow.

307
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,878
You must be dead.

308
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,005
I'm not dead yet.

309
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:13,590
And I'm a doctor.

310
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:17,135
In medical terms, a patient is dead when…

311
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,970
Okay. I get it.

312
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:20,847
Maybe you'll die soon.

313
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,727
I've never seen
something like this happen before.

314
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:29,814
I have no idea what will happen next.

315
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,317
What are you talking about?
I'm going to wake up.

316
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,651
I won't die like this.

317
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:37,197
-You see, I'm--
-Okay. Let's wait and see then.

318
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,619
See you around.

319
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,040
-Bye.
-I don't want to see you again.

320
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,334
Never.

321
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:52,670
And take off that knock-off suit.

322
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:57,926
I can't die like this.

323
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,304
It's not going to happen.

324
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:03,723
I'm not going to die.

325
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,936
I'll wake up and become a senior doctor
and be a director one day.

326
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,127
What is that?

327
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,754
It's perdipine.

328
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,256
I had high blood pressure.

329
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,465
Just 2mm will be enough.

330
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,561
KCL 20ml per hour.
Inject it into the IV drip.

331
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:52,647
Right.

332
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,734
Be careful, Nurse Jung.

333
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,194
If you inject all of it,
I could go into shock.

334
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:03,700
Sorry for yelling at you last time.

335
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,910
Seems like you're still mad at me.

336
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,288
You know I have a bad temper.
Everyone knows.

337
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,039
Cheer up.

338
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,877
What? It's PVC.

339
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,253
Didn't you see that?

340
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,963
Do your job right, Nurse Jung!

341
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,217
I'm sorry. I yelled at you again.

342
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,635
I shouldn't have done that.

343
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:27,265
You know I trust you
more than anyone, don't you?

344
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,368
Happy?

345
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,953
Are you happy?

346
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,955
I'm on the brink of death.

347
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,334
Did you like the praise you got
for doing a solo surgery?

348
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,086
And it wasn't you. It was me.

349
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:01,132
Fine, I know.

350
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,510
You're confused.

351
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:04,636
That's understandable.

352
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,597
I didn't know that would happen.

353
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:09,808
It just happened.

354
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,020
What am I doing right now?

355
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,857
Why am I explaining myself to this punk?

356
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,067
See?

357
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,986
Why did you assign me to ER?

358
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,696
You punk. How can you not know?

359
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,698
Wait a minute.

360
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,492
Can you hear me?

361
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,204
I should've grabbed something to eat
at the convenience store.

362
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:34,415
I got here too early and couldn't
eat anything because of the surgery.

363
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,295
Then go and eat your damn dinner.

364
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:43,216
Whether it's noodles or soup.
Go stuff your face with them.

365
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,427
I never did night duty even as an intern.

366
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,763
I can't slack off at work tomorrow

367
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,849
because they found out
the skills I've been hiding.

368
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,058
It's your fault.

369
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,561
What?

370
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,855
Your what now?

371
00:30:56,938 --> 00:31:00,567
I saved the life of my boss
who was bullying me, which is so noble.

372
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,652
This isn't my style.

373
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,070
Gosh.

374
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:06,698
What do we have here? He's a lunatic.

375
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:10,118
How could he not know
what's happened to him?

376
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,412
I want to see
what's in that head of yours.

377
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:13,371
So…

378
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,875
please wake up.

379
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:23,047
You can't die like this.
You're a famous surgeon.

380
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:31,222
I deserve a thank you from you
so you can't die on me.

381
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,557
That's not all.

382
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,518
You'll treat me to lunch,
let me out of night duty, and more.

383
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,605
Wake up so that I can
become a specialist trained by you.

384
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,442
I'll see you when you wake up.

385
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,236
Sweet dreams.

386
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:49,824
Seung-tak.

387
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,828
When I wake up, you're dead.

388
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,622
Your days will be numbered.

389
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:58,291
I'll get you to quit your residency
no matter what.

390
00:31:58,374 --> 00:31:59,334
You punk.

391
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:03,004
EUNSANG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

392
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,801
Why hasn't he called me yet?

393
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,345
You know the truth, right?

394
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:13,431
-Who Seung-tak really is.
-What do you mean?

395
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:17,602
Seung-tak couldn't even pull out
a cannula. He's no help in ER.

396
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,270
But he changed overnight.

397
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,190
You're the only one who's seen it.

398
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,400
Be honest.

399
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,402
Seung-tak is hiding something, isn't he?

400
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,363
No, he's not.

401
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:33,284
That's not the issue right now.
Dr. Cha is in a coma and…

402
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,204
How is he doing?

403
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,664
Did Dr. Cha wake up?

404
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,291
He hasn't regained consciousness yet.

405
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:45,505
Both of his pupils are fixed at 3mm.
He's not responding to pain.

406
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,966
Gosh. This isn't looking good.

407
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,846
What brings you here, Dr. Eun?

408
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,808
I have the EEG test results.

409
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:57,767
EEG test?

410
00:32:58,434 --> 00:32:59,686
Who asked you to take it?

411
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,730
The administrative director, Mr. Han.

412
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,857
Didn't he tell you?

413
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,736
So how does it look?

414
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,197
It's not good.

415
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,201
Due to cerebral hypoxia,
he suffered brain damage.

416
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:16,869
What?

417
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,082
We see a continuous
background suppression overall.

418
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,751
And no other waves are detected.

419
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,711
You mean…

420
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,255
He's in a coma.

421
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,508
It's hard to make a prognosis.

422
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,177
We'll have to observe him.

423
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:34,929
Gosh…

424
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,368
Why isn't he inside?
What's he doing there?

425
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:58,911
He already knows the prognosis.

426
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,079
He's a doctor.

427
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:04,292
Normally, a heart patient
would wake up four hours after surgery.

428
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,586
It's over if he hasn't woken up by now.

429
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,755
Watch your language.

430
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,298
Don't be so rude.

431
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,382
What?

432
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,926
But that's how he talks.

433
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:20,308
Gosh.

434
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,270
Everyone looks sad.

435
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,065
I guess he was a respectable man.

436
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,902
What's with that look on his face?

437
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:32,904
Is he already in Stage Four?

438
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,990
"Denial, anger, compromise,
depression, and acceptance."

439
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:37,784
The five stages of death.

440
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,661
I've been a ghost for years so I can tell.

441
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:44,290
Most people start with denial,
but he went straight to depression.

442
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:45,917
Maybe it's because he's a doctor.

443
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:50,463
He really is different.
He's very clinical and analytical.

444
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:53,591
Why did you try so hard to reach the top?

445
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,176
You knew it wasn't going to be easy.

446
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,223
What did I do to deserve this?

447
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,516
What did I do?

448
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,604
Was that too harsh?

449
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,190
But it's the truth.

450
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:12,360
You put me down so much
so don't expect any kind words from me.

451
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,320
-That's how it is.
-What did I do?

452
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:15,822
What kind of curse did you put on me?

453
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:30,503
Lucky you.

454
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,880
You're alive.

455
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,257
You can drink a soda.

456
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:47,520
Is it refreshing?

457
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,064
It must be.

458
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,735
There's no one at home
to give water to my baby.

459
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,989
Mandu, I'll come get you soon.

460
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,123
-Are you feeling okay?
-Why would he not be?

461
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:09,333
He's alive. You should be asking me that.

462
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,794
This tastes weird.

463
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:15,006
I'll ask my mom
to change the vending machines.

464
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,966
That's just how that drink tastes.

465
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:20,094
-Pick the blue one next time.
-If you're upset, just say it.

466
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,804
Don't take it out on the vending machine.

467
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:28,102
They're ignoring me now that I'm a ghost.

468
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:29,729
Wait a minute.

469
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,689
They've always been like that.

470
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:33,316
Me?

471
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,193
Why would I be upset?

472
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,528
It's not my fault
that he got in an accident.

473
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,946
Why did he drive recklessly?

474
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,532
That's pretty harsh.

475
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,618
As a first-year resident, I did my best.

476
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,245
Everyone's lives are determined by fate.

477
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,497
He was just

478
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,833
destined to end up like that.

479
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,054
Gosh, I thought it was over.

480
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:06,474
But it seems like he's going to enter
Stage One again because of that kid.

481
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:10,269
That young doctor supposedly
mastered all medical theories,

482
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,230
but he's also a master of quotable lines.

483
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,023
What's that?

484
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,151
I mean he tells the truth as it is,

485
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,528
but he delivers it with a sting.

486
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,783
Shall we go now?

487
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,081
It all started that day.

488
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:32,750
The day he showed up here.

489
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,503
I had an ominous feeling that morning.

490
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,589
It's why I assigned you to ER.
This is all your fault.

491
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,842
And what? "Why did he drive recklessly?"

492
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,928
I was destined to end up like that?

493
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,430
Fine. I'm taking you with me.

494
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,975
Instead of my baby, I'll take you.

495
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,101
Come here, Seung-tak.

496
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,102
Come here.

497
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,146
What?

498
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,523
What was that just now?

499
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,526
Come back here.

500
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,075
I said come back.

501
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,786
We meet again.

502
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,205
Don't be so shocked.

503
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,124
It's not like we haven't met before.

504
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,877
I came by because I thought
you'd have some questions.

505
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,630
-Forget it. Bye.
-Hold on.

506
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,967
Wait a minute. What is this?
What's happening to me?

507
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,927
So what's happening is now…

508
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,013
A coma ghost has boundary limits.

509
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,390
So you can only move within it.

510
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,225
In English, you call it a "boundary."

511
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,478
What is that?

512
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,481
Now, look. You see where your body is?

513
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,192
So you drop a pin right there.

514
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:46,532
You can move freely
within a 100-meter radius.

515
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:52,913
So the radius would look like this.

516
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,666
See? And…

517
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:59,670
you can only move within this space.

518
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,673
You can't escape it. Never.

519
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,550
-What if I do?
-Gosh.

520
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,844
I told you, you can't.

521
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,013
Go ahead and try.

522
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,349
Then where is my boundary?

523
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,434
Where is your body located?

524
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:15,603
You're in the ICU, right?

525
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:19,190
Picture it in your mind.

526
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:24,779
Analyze the hospital structure.

527
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,203
That's utter nonsense.

528
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,080
Who comes up with stuff like that?

529
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,414
It doesn't make any sense.

530
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,707
It wasn't me.

531
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:38,918
It's the heavens.

532
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:42,421
And never stay

533
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,965
too far away from your body.

534
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,594
If you wake up,
you need to enter your body quickly.

535
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:50,888
Right?

536
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,556
Then…

537
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,225
-I'll get going.
-What?

538
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,150
Like this.

539
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:04,902
See?

540
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,911
I'm a free soul, you see.

541
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:14,870
If you're jealous,

542
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,956
you can drop dead.

543
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,921
What? A conference?

544
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,756
Over the chairman's operation?

545
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,593
We need to leave records
in order to see who's responsible.

546
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,888
If it's considered malpractice,
our hospital's reputation will suffer.

547
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:34,932
He was a VIP, after all.

548
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,934
Yes.

549
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,144
What is it?

550
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,521
Is there a problem?

551
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:44,191
Dr. Cha oversaw the operation
but he's in a coma.

552
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,280
But we can't wait forever.
We don't know when he'll wake up.

553
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:51,532
We should go ahead with the conference.

554
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,160
Schedule it to happen as soon as possible.

555
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:56,412
What will happen to Dr. Cha now?

556
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,038
I don't know.

557
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:01,792
At this rate, they'll open his windpipe
and insert a tube.

558
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:05,296
And a month after that,
he'll be moved to a nursing hospital.

559
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:08,883
When that happens,
who do we talk to sign it off?

560
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:10,551
What's wrong?

561
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,012
He doesn't have any family.

562
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:15,473
And he doesn't have a guardian either.

563
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,684
Oh, my. That's so sad.

564
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:35,010
I had two operations scheduled for today.

565
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,721
Tomorrow, I have three scheduled.

566
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,099
Fine.

567
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:43,435
That's all I had going in my life.

568
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,647
My life wasn't that great.

569
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,402
One should know to let go when it's time.

570
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:01,912
Where do you think you're going?

571
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,665
Save me before you go then.

572
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,585
-Mr. Jang?
-What?

573
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,253
Did that hurt?

574
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,422
It probably did.

575
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,925
I used to work out when I was younger.

576
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:20,431
How about I give you
a few more knocks to the head?

577
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,182
No thank you. Why would you?

578
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,104
Should we stop them?

579
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,939
It's fine. It's for the better.

580
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,150
I didn't imagine the chairman
to act like that.

581
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:33,944
He's quite a character.

582
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,280
You're even worse, you know.

583
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:44,204
Oh, gosh. When did you get here?

584
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,415
Oh, him?

585
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:47,833
He's a ghost.

586
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:48,876
He's a ghost?

587
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:50,294
Is he dead?

588
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:53,047
No. He's a coma ghost.

589
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,006
Coma?

590
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:55,633
The chairman is in a coma?

591
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:58,344
That's impossible.
I performed a successful operation.

592
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:00,512
Then it must have been something else.

593
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:05,100
LEE SUN-HO

594
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:07,895
-Yes.
-Doctor.

595
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,521
The patient's vitals are strange.

596
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,483
Doctor, his blood pressure
is dropping, too.

597
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:14,401
Do you think a suture has broken?

598
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:18,155
-Where is the chairman's body?
-You know the VIP wing, right?

599
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:20,491
He's in the corner room.

600
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:21,659
The deluxe suite.

601
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:24,995
It's the other way.

602
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:34,213
ELEVATOR TO WARD B

603
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:40,844
Why is she still here?

604
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,846
What are you doing here?

605
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:47,184
Let's meet up.

606
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:49,436
Can you come right now?

607
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:52,981
My flight to the States
leaves tomorrow morning.

608
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,777
I have something to tell you before I go.

609
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,905
Wait for me at the spot
where we used to meet.

610
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:04,076
Why didn't you show up?

611
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:06,203
And you came

612
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:09,415
to the operating room
with a worried expression.

613
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,376
What were you up to?

614
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:20,300
Gosh, she's here again.

615
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,142
I'm sorry.

616
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:31,061
We cannot let anyone in
without the Vice President's permission.

617
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,566
That's the ninth time you've told me.

618
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,735
Did you tell him I want to talk to him?

619
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:40,737
And what will you do then?

620
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:46,869
Did you move in here?

621
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:49,663
You're always sneaking in here
like a little rat.

622
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:51,790
I need to see him with my own two eyes.

623
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,208
And do what?

624
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,835
If you don't want that,

625
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,754
let me see his medical records at least.

626
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,256
And do what?

627
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,550
What can you do?

628
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:02,843
I've asked you three times now.

629
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,928
I was told Dad's operation was a success.

630
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,890
There has to be a reason
why he's in a coma.

631
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:10,893
Maybe he had the wrong medication
or it could be something else.

632
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,770
So you're a doctor?

633
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,273
Hey.

634
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,317
Quit bothering me and get lost.

635
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,986
Go back to America
and stay out of my sight.

636
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:28,285
You still don't get it, do you?

637
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:29,411
Hey.

638
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,371
I never accepted you as my sister.

639
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,832
You were only his daughter
while he was alive.

640
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,959
I've said that three times already.

641
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,879
It's like talking to a wall.
You haven't changed at all.

642
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:42,132
That goes for you too.

643
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:47,012
-What?
-I don't consider you as my brother.

644
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:48,805
Three times, I did.

645
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:53,018
You're still rude and violent.

646
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,398
Nothing has changed with you.
None the wiser, either.

647
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,152
-Why you…
-I'll be back.

648
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,154
And you'll either open that door

649
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,990
or show me his medical records…

650
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,702
because Dad is still alive…

651
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:17,668
and there's no telling what I'll do next.

652
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:33,100
I can't stand the sight of her.

653
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:54,496
Did he hurt your feelings?

654
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,208
It wasn't even that bad.

655
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:15,892
You dumped me

656
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,437
only to be treated like that?

657
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,632
It's the chairman's operation records.

658
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:48,925
Dr. Kim.

659
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,260
-Yes?
-No!

660
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:53,347
I corrected the chart
for the patient in Room 304.

661
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,431
-Okay.
-Heart rate and blood pressure

662
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:56,266
-were normal.
-I see.

663
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,934
She's in stable recovery.

664
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,813
As you requested,
I referred her to neurosurgery.

665
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:06,151
See? I told you it wouldn’t work.

666
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:10,238
That's proof that you're still alive.

667
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:12,699
You should be glad.

668
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:18,455
Yesterday, her IMR was 1.6.

669
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:19,831
Dr. Kim.

670
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,210
Could we talk for a minute?

671
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:28,215
What happened to the chairman
after surgery?

672
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,466
Right, tell me.

673
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:30,842
What happened that night?

674
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:33,887
The suture broke.

675
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,138
What? How?

676
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:38,475
But it was fine before.
Why would it break?

677
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:41,645
I found that strange, too.
So I did an APTT test.

678
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,814
It said he had elevated heparin levels.

679
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:44,731
-What?
-What?

680
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,984
Dr. Ban ordered a dose of protamine
and it stabilized his condition.

681
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:50,862
But his brain didn't get enough oxygen
when his blood pressure dropped.

682
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,656
How could there be elevated levels?

683
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:53,699
What was the dosage?

684
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:54,825
I administered 5,000 as ordered.

685
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,535
Are you crazy? 5,000?

686
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,705
Dr. Ahn. Did you order that much? Why?

687
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,206
What are you saying?

688
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:03,417
I told you to give him
1,000 continuously, just in case.

689
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,002
Even a dosage of 1,000 is a lot.
Was there a problem?

690
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,045
What?

691
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,382
But you told me
to give him a bolus dose of 5,000.

692
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:11,341
Are you stupid?

693
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,051
It's not even surgery.

694
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,761
Who gives a bolus dose of 5000?

695
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:15,846
So?

696
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:18,432
You gave him 5,000?

697
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,100
Well…

698
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,561
I didn't inject it myself.

699
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,403
I was preoccupied with something

700
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:33,029
so I asked Seung-tak to do it.

701
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:34,406
Seung-tak?

702
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,409
You asked Seung-tak
to give him a dose of 5,000?

703
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:39,786
Well, I don't remember
if I told him 5,000 or 1,000.

704
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,414
I think Seung-tak gave him a high dose
based on what happened.

705
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:44,708
I haven't checked yet.

706
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:47,043
Dr. Ban told me to
not tell anyone for now.

707
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:51,006
Seung-tak!

708
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,383
Come here, you punk!

709
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,596
What did you do to him?

710
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:59,389
Why did you do that to my patient?

711
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,565
Dr. Ahn. I was meaning to talk--

712
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:11,902
What is this?

713
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:14,279
You're here to talk about
the heparin levels, right?

714
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:15,989
That punk… He was right here.

715
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,581
Where did that punk go, Dr. Ahn?

716
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:25,665
Watch your language.

717
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,417
Don't talk like that to a fellow.

718
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:29,961
Which punk

719
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:31,838
are you talking about?

720
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,261
See?

721
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:40,889
I told you it wouldn’t work.

722
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:44,601
That's proof that you're still alive.

723
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:48,271
We have a patient with an impaled stomach.

724
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:51,858
He fell around a construction site
and impaled himself on a steel rod.

725
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:53,652
Hey.

726
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,655
-You need to see this patient first.
-I could be dying right now.

727
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:57,989
I don't have--

728
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,575
Gloves! Hurry!

729
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:16,675
No organ damage.
The main blood vessel is intact.

730
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:18,510
The rod went 10 cm deep
and penetrated the stomach lining.

731
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:19,719
Just stitch him up
and sterilize the wound. He'll be fine.

732
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,054
Take care of the rest, Ms. Oh.

733
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,275
Tess!

734
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:37,404
Why am I able to possess his body?

735
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:38,989
You can

736
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,283
see me?

737
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:44,828
It's me. Dr. Cha.

738
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,497
How do I get out of his body?

739
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:48,915
I was able to possess him, but…

740
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:50,667
Well, that's…

741
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:54,254
Well, okay. You know Iron Man, right?

742
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:57,340
How does he take off his suit?

743
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,594
He just wills it and it comes off.

744
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:03,972
It's the same. Will yourself to come out.

745
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,185
It's not working.

746
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,729
Then just step of out him.

747
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:13,982
How?

748
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:15,483
Just push.

749
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:17,360
Push!

750
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:23,867
What?

751
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:25,827
Where am I?

752
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:27,203
What am I doing here?

753
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,373
You saw that, right?
I can possess his body.

754
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,375
I can't possess anyone else, but why him?

755
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:33,460
Beats me.

756
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:35,503
What just happened?

757
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,047
Was I possessed?

758
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,800
-Go away, ghost!
-No. I'm not going away.

759
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,552
What? My destiny?

760
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,471
Well, this is your destiny, you punk.

761
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:49,976
Do you see how lost he is?
This feels great. I love it.

762
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:51,895
You love it?

763
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:53,021
-You like it?
-Yes, I do.

764
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:56,232
-What if you can never wake up?
-What?

765
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:58,693
If you keep doing that
just because you can,

766
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:01,237
you might never wake up from your coma.

767
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:12,624
Nine times one is nine.

768
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:15,001
Nine times two is eighteen.

769
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,711
Nine times three is twenty-seven.

770
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:24,010
Yes, Mom.

771
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:26,388
I have something to ask you.

772
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:29,891
If I were to…

773
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:33,603
You know, I'm a great singer
and have good looks too.

774
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:36,314
Right. I'm good-looking.

775
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:41,194
So, if O were to become a singer or actor
instead of a doctor, then…

776
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:44,781
Okay.

777
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:45,824
You'll disown me?

778
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:47,367
Son.

779
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:50,120
I'll see you later at home.

780
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:59,212
Dr. Kim, can you come here for a minute?

781
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:03,800
Nurse, I need you here.

782
00:55:18,314 --> 00:55:19,566
What are you doing there?

783
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:25,238
I was about to go inside.

784
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:28,324
What for? Did you come to
check on the impaled patient?

785
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:31,995
He's still here?

786
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,580
He was discharged
after we stitched him up.

787
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:36,624
I followed your orders
after you diagnosed him.

788
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:38,793
I see.

789
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:42,505
My genius brain must have saved the day.

790
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:43,673
Right?

791
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,843
Are you feeling all right?

792
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:49,012
What? Me? Like how?

793
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:54,142
Maybe your head hurts
or you lost control of your body.

794
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:56,936
I feel fine. I feel great
from my head to my toes.

795
00:55:58,772 --> 00:55:59,606
Okay.

796
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:03,026
Can you get me a cup of coffee
since you're feeling great?

797
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:06,029
Sure. I'll go get some.
I'll get the most expensive one.

798
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:14,662
You want to hide it?

799
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:16,998
Well…

800
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,709
I'll go along with it for now.

801
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:21,920
Here's your coffee.

802
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:28,051
There you are. Why haven't you
been taking my calls?

803
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,886
I almost spilled my coffee.

804
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,224
Let me ask you something.

805
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:36,392
How long do I have to work in the ER?

806
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:38,561
That's not important right now.

807
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,980
What's more important than that to me
at this point?

808
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:45,819
Here he comes.

809
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,198
What? Who is he?

810
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:52,367
Isn't it obvious? It's the chairman's son.

811
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,538
The chairman's son?

812
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,169
What?

813
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,015
So tell me. What's Plan B?

814
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,772
Wasn't the chairman's operation a success?

815
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,232
I knew this would happen.

816
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:26,568
I couldn't tell you this
because it involves Dr. Cha.

817
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,030
But the chairman didn't wake up.

818
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:33,867
What?

819
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:35,952
He's in a coma. Just like Dr. Cha.

820
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:41,666
Why do you think Dr. Cha
got into a car crash on his way back?

821
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,418
How could this happen?

822
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:45,795
The patient and his doctor
are both in a coma.

823
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:51,301
So you came back.

824
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:55,805
Have you found a way to save me?

825
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:03,480
You've got it all wrong.

826
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:06,149
I'm not the one who did this to you.

827
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:08,485
If it wasn't you, then who was it?

828
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:14,824
You're not someone
who blames your subordinates, I see.

829
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:18,745
That's the trait of a good leader.

830
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:21,998
Now find a way to fix this.

831
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:24,125
How can I do that in this state?

832
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,127
Can't you see?

833
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,672
I'm a ghost just like you, sir!
A spirit!

834
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:37,096
I can't say you deserve
what happened to you.

835
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,976
Why did you leave my side like that?

836
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,187
What was so urgent?

837
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,857
Take your lumps and get over yourself.

838
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:48,816
Anyway…

839
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:52,153
Give me back my life.

840
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,531
If you don't want my son to bury you.

841
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:55,698
But sir…

842
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:00,495
Don't let the press run any stories.
Stop any rumors.

843
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:02,580
Tell them to wait until we make
an official announcement.

844
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,875
Do I have to tell you how to do your job?

845
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:10,755
Damn it.

846
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,968
There'll be tabloid articles
about you, Dad.

847
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:19,389
So why

848
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:22,684
did you take my advice, Dad?

849
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:25,562
You should've listened to
your smart daughter.

850
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:30,024
You could've lived for
at least a year without surgery.

851
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:33,403
Why didn't you give me what I asked for?

852
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:35,697
Then I wouldn't have gone this far.

853
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,824
You made me do this to you.

854
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:41,286
I can hardly rest for a minute.

855
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:44,872
This is Jang Min-ho.

856
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:45,957
Yes?

857
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:47,375
Right now?

858
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:22,785
Our hospital has taken
a heavy loss by losing Dr. Cha.

859
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:28,875
I thought you hired someone
to crash into his car.

860
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,877
I'm not an idiot.

861
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,756
How could I when Dr. Cha is
our star surgeon who brings in the money?

862
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:38,926
Then figure out how much more I owe you.

863
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,261
Tell me when you're done.

864
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:44,140
I'm a numbers guy.

865
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:46,893
What is the doctor's conference about?

866
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,562
You have a plan?

867
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:52,482
One of the heart surgeons is in my pocket.

868
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:54,859
So don't worry about that.

869
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:01,908
The problem is Dr. Cha.

870
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:02,950
What?

871
01:01:04,118 --> 01:01:06,162
I'm sure we'll come up with something.

872
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:08,331
Let's think it over.

873
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:21,844
Yes, Jae-won?

874
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:26,432
Something came up so I need to ask you
for a favor. It's urgent.

875
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:29,435
Could you administer the chairman
his medicine for me?

876
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:34,607
I told you to inject 1,000 units
of heparin, right?

877
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,859
It's 5,000 units of heparin.
Dr. Cha's orders.

878
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:38,986
Will you do it for me?

879
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:46,327
What? The coffee is cold.

880
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:49,747
What have you been doing
that you didn't drink a sip?

881
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:51,666
Right, the coffee.

882
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,961
She's going to kick my backside for this.

883
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:56,504
What was that?

884
01:01:58,297 --> 01:01:59,716
The beds in the sleeping quarters.

885
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:01,592
My back hurts like hell.

886
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:02,677
My back.

887
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,513
It was just one night shift.
Don't be a wimp.

888
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:08,349
I'm going to fix this.

889
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:10,309
Replace the old beds with new ones.

890
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,145
What's the use of making money
when you're not spending it?

891
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:15,982
By the way. Dr. Ahn will be named

892
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:18,025
as the lead surgeon
for Dr. Cha's operation.

893
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:23,948
I'm covering it up so that
it won't be a blemish on your record.

894
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:26,701
Anyway, good work.

895
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:30,663
I was worried about you,
but you're doing great.

896
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:32,999
Just keep going as is.

897
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:36,669
I've got your back.
Don't forget that. Okay?

898
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:36,729
I learned that there are…

899
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:39,982
some advantages of being a ghost.

900
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:44,821
I can eavesdrop on conversations.

901
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:49,283
And learn a lot.

902
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:56,415
But…

903
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,670
there's one thing I still don't know.

904
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:07,385
When you held the scalpel
in the operating room…

905
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:12,265
were you trying to kill me
instead of saving me?

906
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,853
What you said to me in the ICU…

907
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:23,985
That you wished for me to wake up.

908
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:29,532
Was that a lie?

909
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,035
Did you feel guilty all of a sudden?

910
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:42,837
I had no idea.

911
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:46,924
So…

912
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:51,929
the reason why
there were no surgeons available

913
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:55,433
was because the chairman
was in a critical condition.

914
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:57,894
And the heparin dosage wasn't a mistake.

915
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:00,563
Since when?

916
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:04,609
How long has this been going on?

917
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:09,196
How could you play with people's lives?

918
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:11,616
You call yourself a doctor?

919
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:13,367
Why? For what reason?

920
01:05:18,205 --> 01:05:19,582
To become a heart specialist?

921
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:22,627
Did your brother promise

922
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:25,963
that he'll make you a specialist
if you did as he said?

923
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:28,633
You piece of trash.

924
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:32,678
Do you know what you've done?

925
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:42,647
What?

926
01:05:45,232 --> 01:05:46,400
The ICU?

927
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:49,195
What about Dr. Cha?

928
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:50,947
What happened to me?

929
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,531
I'll be right there.

930
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:28,544
You can do it.
I'm rooting for you, Cha Young-min.

931
01:07:28,627 --> 01:07:30,379
Did I say that?

932
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:31,630
Yes, you did.

933
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:33,674
I paid you back.

934
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:36,469
Why did you do that?
Think of the repercussions.

935
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:37,720
I'll find out who did this to you.

936
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:40,556
You have your own fish to fry.
You can't back that up.

937
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:41,766
What did she just do?

938
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:43,726
Let's make one thing clear between us.

939
01:07:43,809 --> 01:07:45,644
Why is she looking at this?

940
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:46,979
What are they planning now?

941
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,355
He should stay in that body or else…

942
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:52,026
They're going to move you
to another place today.

943
01:07:56,072 --> 01:08:01,077
