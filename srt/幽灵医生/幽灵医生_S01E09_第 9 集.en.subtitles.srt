1
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,493
Hey, come on. Hurry up!

2
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:38,955
He's so excited.

3
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,041
Yes, I'm on my way.

4
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,545
I told you that we can't accept
any patients.

5
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,213
The patient says he has a cold sensation
in his right leg.

6
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,631
-No, we can't.
-I think

7
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,216
it's a peripheral artery disease.

8
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,143
Why did you go that far?

9
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,520
You could've just ignored the patient.

10
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,814
You couldn't handle it.

11
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,610
Because I didn't want
to have poor surgical skills like you.

12
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:17,035
There was an emergency patient before me,

13
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:22,248
and I got so angry at myself

14
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,085
for being unable to do anything to help.

15
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,549
I never wanted to feel

16
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,095
anything like that again.

17
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,265
-Seung-tak.
-Yes.

18
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,226
Seung-tak? Why did you come?

19
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,938
Atherosclerosis in his right leg, right?

20
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,398
Bring the patient to the treatment room.
I'll handle it.

21
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,109
What? Not again.

22
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,194
The operating rooms are all taken.

23
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,612
I'll operate here.
Bring the patient around.

24
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,698
This patient doesn't have any ID.

25
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,201
So what? Can't you see
his leg turning white?

26
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,788
If his leg turns blue in color,
we won't be able to save his leg.

27
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,039
Bring him in.

28
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,376
Hey, what's going on?
Why are you bringing him back?

29
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,545
How can a doctor--

30
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:15,135
We can't turn away a sick patient
without treating him.

31
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,136
In our…

32
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:19,889
Not in my hospital.

33
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,435
Now then. Hurry. Bring him in.

34
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,521
-Let's hurry.
-Hey.

35
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,070
Because my family are board members,

36
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,780
the staff can't pick on me.

37
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,908
But you were a lowly intern

38
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,327
who suddenly became a genius.

39
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,913
I don't think the other doctors

40
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,293
looked kindly on you after that.

41
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,796
You're right.

42
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,007
It was tough.

43
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,969
Why you bastard. We gave you a warning
but you ignored us again.

44
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,680
You think you're so special?

45
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:04,601
All hail the genius doctor. What an ego.

46
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,311
You have no respect, do you?

47
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,187
Why didn't you send away the patient?

48
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,939
Who said you could do the operation?

49
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,817
On top of my work,
I also had to deal with that.

50
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,570
It was tough.

51
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:23,036
I merely wanted to save patients.
I didn't know who was possessing me,

52
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,621
so I couldn't argue with him.

53
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,666
So I just did what I could.

54
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:33,046
I had to endure it to become a doctor.

55
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,047
But…

56
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,841
what reason do you have?

57
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:40,011
For me, you are
the only person I can possess,

58
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,471
so I've got no options.

59
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,973
But you're free to refuse.

60
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,101
So why? You didn't like me
because of my attitude.

61
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,311
You haven't changed a bit.

62
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:49,729
Why you…

63
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,564
Because…

64
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,150
I realized something.

65
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,907
You were a kind intern back then,

66
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,369
but now I kind of understood
how those bad experiences

67
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,704
made you into a mean person.

68
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:10,750
You looked like a warrior
wanting to fight for the patients.

69
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,927
Let's begin. Focus now. Scalpel.

70
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,102
Suction.

71
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,896
Forceps. Bovie.

72
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,946
Mastoid.

73
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,411
So keep being a doctor.

74
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,206
Whether you wake up or not.
Until the day you die.

75
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:55,128
If you can,
be kind like you were as an intern.

76
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,717
Apply pressure.

77
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,059
Prolene 5-0. Double-armed suture.

78
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,918
Of course.

79
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,672
My delicate technique--

80
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,758
My…

81
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,513
You're telling me that Seung-tak submitted
this operation record,

82
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:51,476
but you think Dr. Cha wrote it
and Seung-tak didn't know about this?

83
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,144
Then it got deleted?

84
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,814
You're not sure if Seung-tak
or Dr. Cha deleted it?

85
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,610
Do you hear yourself?

86
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,195
I know it sounds strange.

87
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,530
-I really do, but--
-Are you drunk?

88
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,158
I'm the one who had a drink.

89
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:10,036
I didn't tell you
about Seung-tak's behavior.

90
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,082
But there have been
several bizarre incidents.

91
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:17,376
With this theory of mine,
everything that's happened makes sense.

92
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,462
What theory are you talking about?

93
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:25,510
You think Dr. Cha has become a ghost
and possesses Seung-tak's body?

94
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,721
And you call yourself a doctor?

95
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,396
What is it at this hour?

96
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,358
Who's coming?

97
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:43,986
All right.

98
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,373
You should see a psychiatrist.

99
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,583
Not one at our hospital.
Go to another one.

100
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,294
You need medicine, not alcohol.

101
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,423
I have so many other things
to take care of right now.

102
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,342
What about Seung-tak's surgical skills?

103
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,557
Does it make sense?

104
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,729
Soo-jung, you're out of line.

105
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,315
No, I'm staying in my lane.

106
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:26,988
How could you page a senior doctor
without getting it cleared first?

107
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:30,199
ER is not a call center!

108
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,827
We don't take every patient
and page every doctor.

109
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,414
We shouldn't be turning away patients
like customers who return their purchases.

110
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:40,376
Return a purchase? How could you
make such a crass comment?

111
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,920
I'm sorry. I'll go back to work now.

112
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:49,135
Gosh. Young interns these days…

113
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:52,221
They need to give incoming
medical students personality tests.

114
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,640
Everyone thinks they know
more than a doctor. Gosh.

115
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,562
-What are you doing?
-I'm disinfecting.

116
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,190
There's an odor coming from somewhere.

117
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,318
It's like there's a cow
or dog somewhere around.

118
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,153
Your coat smells. Smell it.

119
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,490
No, it's coming from you.
Your personality.

120
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,992
You should take a personality test.
Take it off.

121
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:16,704
Why are unqualified doctors
wearing these precious white coats?

122
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:21,584
Let's disinfect your entire body!

123
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,093
Here, have one.

124
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:35,139
Oh my. You're so kind.

125
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:36,766
Thank you.

126
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:43,064
But Doctor, you look very happy today.

127
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,649
Did something good happen?

128
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:45,608
Do I look happy?

129
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:46,526
Yes.

130
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,153
Something good did happen.

131
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,200
Is it because of the young doctor?

132
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,994
He was treating
an emergency patient earlier?

133
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,829
Did you see that? He's good, isn't he?

134
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,166
I'm not a doctor so how would I know.

135
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,837
But why are you happy
over what the young doctor did?

136
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,714
You said he owed you big time.

137
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,383
Well…

138
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,553
he's paying it back little by little.

139
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:17,473
Oh my. That's great.

140
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,685
See. I told you so.
He's not a pathetic guy.

141
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,397
But how do you know Seung-tak so well?

142
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,905
When you reach my age,
you become a good judge of character.

143
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,700
Based on life experiences.

144
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,748
My grandpa would like him
if he ever met him.

145
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,554
You're very lucky, sir.

146
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,472
You need to be more careful next time.

147
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,356
Although I've never met your grandpa,

148
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,569
I'm sure he'll be very proud of
how pretty you are.

149
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,070
What?

150
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,116
I somehow came here in the middle of work.

151
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,952
Thanks for the soft drink.

152
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:21,704
All right.

153
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,916
Keep growing as a doctor.

154
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:27,627
Cheers.

155
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:51,192
What brings you to the hospital
at this hour, Grandpa?

156
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,111
Who told you I came?

157
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,323
I stopped by to see how things are.

158
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,244
You reek of alcohol.

159
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,622
You're the administrative director.

160
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,666
You shouldn't drink on the job.

161
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,837
I had to meet an important client
at a bar. I'm sorry, Grandpa.

162
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,757
But why are you sitting here?

163
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,676
I was reminiscing.

164
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,678
And also curious about
if this place changed.

165
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,639
Grandpa, please come to my office.

166
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,475
No thanks. I think I'll go.

167
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,726
Sir!

168
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:31,440
-What's the occasion for your visit, sir?
-Why didn't you tell us you were coming?

169
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,362
You have a lot of spare time, I see.

170
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,989
Respond quickly like that
to the patients instead of me.

171
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,744
Dr. Ban, you're working hard, aren't you?

172
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,204
Yes?

173
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,957
The Cardiology Department
is doing great work.

174
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,377
Is there anything you need help with?

175
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:58,050
Since you're asking what help we need,

176
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,804
I would like some help with adding
a couple of surgeons to our department

177
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,557
because Dr. Cha is out of commission
due to his accident.

178
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,058
Dr. Ban, we can discuss that later
in my office.

179
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,145
-This isn't the place to--
-What am I hearing?

180
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,731
Nobody has been hired
to fill Dr. Cha's vacancy?

181
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,191
Grandpa, you see…

182
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:19,029
Sir, I'm monitoring the situation
with Dr. Cha before making a decision.

183
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,574
Your job is to monitor the hospital.

184
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,785
But staff vacancies need
to be filled right away.

185
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,246
That's what administrative directors do.

186
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,083
You support the medical staff
and make sure things run smoothly.

187
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,754
If you're going to be distracted
from your job due to catering to clients,

188
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,257
then you can resign from your post.

189
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,639
I wonder if I got through to him.

190
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,018
When will he do his job right?

191
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,400
Old friend, you're so old-fashioned

192
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,861
and full of spirit.

193
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,615
Nice to see you in a long while.

194
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:04,533
And…

195
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,162
don't worry too much about them.

196
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,734
I heard she got a big inheritance.

197
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:39,902
Why is she still working?

198
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,404
She said she'd keep working here for now.

199
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:46,075
Well, since Dr. Cha is still lying here,

200
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,953
she wouldn't be able to leave Dr. Cha
unless he died.

201
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:21,861
No, that's not how I write my "O"s.

202
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:26,740
My handwriting is rounder.

203
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:31,704
Sir, he's got unsteady hands.
I apologize on his behalf.

204
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:38,961
I'm sorry for asking doctors like you
to help me with my personal stuff.

205
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:44,383
But consider it as a small contribution
to my funeral.

206
00:14:56,061 --> 00:15:00,691
Se-jin, you were always

207
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:04,069
my precious baby daughter.

208
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:08,407
I'm sorry that I never got to tell you
I loved you.

209
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:14,121
Thank you for watching over me
as I reach the end.

210
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,207
I love you.

211
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:19,919
Your Dad.

212
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,590
Did you know

213
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:30,721
that I never called him "Dad"
when we spoke?

214
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,183
I can't tell him

215
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,894
I don't harbor a grudge against him.

216
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,815
Neither can I tell him he doesn't need
to apologize.

217
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,279
I didn't get to say, "I love you."

218
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,368
While he was alive,

219
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,454
I didn't get the chance to say that.

220
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,670
But I did announce his time of death.

221
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,216
Will you do that to me, too?

222
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,011
You have a lot to say.

223
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,764
You want to hear an explanation from me.

224
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,935
I asked for a favor.

225
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,272
Please don't make me
declare your time of death.

226
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,609
So wake up.

227
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,779
Please!

228
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,827
Please open your eyes.

229
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,371
Please, Young-min.

230
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,596
He's even making me fetch coffee for him.

231
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,390
Young-min.

232
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,939
It's you, right?

233
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,234
I'm dreaming now, right?

234
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,863
You appeared in my dreams.

235
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,617
Because I got mad at you.

236
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,542
No.

237
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,794
It's because I saw you cry.

238
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,006
You're right.

239
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:17,966
You're dreaming.

240
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,526
It's so nice.

241
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,156
I hope I won't wake up from this.

242
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,894
Well, you know…

243
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,397
Don't tell me you remember last night.

244
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,400
You were dreaming.
I momentarily appeared in your dream.

245
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,786
Young-min, can you hear me?

246
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,037
Young-min!

247
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,458
Seung-tak!

248
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,962
Seung-tak, wake up.

249
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,674
Wish I could slap you.
I'd like to punch you in the throat.

250
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,050
Come on.

251
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,555
What am I doing here again?

252
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,309
You enter my body during the day
and even at night.

253
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:53,520
It's as if I'm going to die before you do.

254
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,819
Seung-tak, who's dying?

255
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,324
Seung-tak!

256
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,076
Why is he more excited than me?

257
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,494
Excuse me.

258
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,008
Is it true that there's a change
in Dr. Cha's brainwaves?

259
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,178
How could you know that?

260
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:28,597
Who told you? I didn't tell anyone yet.

261
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,932
You slipped up again.

262
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,062
You see…

263
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,064
I had this dream…

264
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,358
Like a premonition.

265
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,366
These are his recent brainwaves records.

266
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,410
The waves are showing activity.

267
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:53,872
And last night, he even had alpha
and theta waves.

268
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,540
That means…

269
00:22:56,541 --> 00:23:00,712
He's showing brain activity
as indicated by the waves.

270
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:04,549
There's a possibility he can wake up.

271
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,551
How much longer will it take?

272
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,513
That's hard to tell.

273
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:13,517
We can't do much
except monitor his condition.

274
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,853
We'll have to see
how his brainwaves improve.

275
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,522
-What's the cause?
-Right!

276
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,692
What caused the change in his brainwaves?

277
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:25,737
I don't know.

278
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,739
What?

279
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:32,410
The medical field doesn't provide
an explanation for this.

280
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,371
-Except that…
-Except?

281
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:35,789
Except what?

282
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:38,792
It's very rare but in America,

283
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,919
they call it happy hormones.

284
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,963
It's not a medical explanation.

285
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:46,174
It's a theory that positive
brain stimulation helps the patient.

286
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,432
I wonder what's going on in his brain.

287
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,101
What could be making him happy?

288
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,232
Last night…

289
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:03,900
So…

290
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,736
the brainwaves appeared out of nowhere.

291
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,156
Behind my back.

292
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,785
What are you imagining right now?

293
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,288
Seung-tak, I didn't do anything.

294
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,290
I didn't.

295
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,427
Seung-tak.

296
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:38,101
Try to be careful.
About time you knew to be careful.

297
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,978
You weren't careful either.

298
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:46,943
What could it be?

299
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,738
-What?
-You were in the room, too.

300
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,072
The happy hormones.

301
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:57,537
Wait a second. Did you use my body to…

302
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,580
Are you crazy?

303
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,957
How could I?

304
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,251
I didn't go all the way.

305
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,337
All the way?

306
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,173
Then what did you do?
What did you use my body for?

307
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,595
I just used your hand to cover her
in a blanket.

308
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,430
While she was asleep.

309
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,243
Are you sure she doesn't remember?

310
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:19,786
Yes, I'm certain.

311
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,543
What is it now?

312
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,254
Let's get something straight.

313
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,589
You better not use me in your romance.

314
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,550
I would never do that.

315
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:36,052
I know that guys
can get passionate sometimes.

316
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:39,139
Keep it under control.
Unleash it when you return to your body.

317
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,559
So control yourself and use good judgment.

318
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:43,643
Let's be adults.

319
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,563
You're an adult
but never got intimate with anyone?

320
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:47,897
You're a virgin, right?

321
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:49,858
That's not the issue.

322
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,068
Forget it.

323
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,239
Let's figure this out.
What brings these happy hormones?

324
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,035
What boosts my mood?

325
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,454
Playing with my baby,
watching Jessica's concerts,

326
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:04,622
getting a hand mask,
or having sweet coffee.

327
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,207
What a life you have.

328
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,836
Are you stupid? Not those things.
Recall what you did recently.

329
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,215
Look who's talking.

330
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,259
Let's see.

331
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,969
Recently…

332
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:21,139
I think I know what.

333
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,977
-Cut.
-Cut.

334
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,480
Good job?

335
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:29,439
Of course.

336
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,735
The technique is in your hands.

337
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,120
What a life you have.

338
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,955
-Speak for yourself.
-Okay. Let's do this.

339
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:47,665
We've got this.

340
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:51,836
It's this way. Damn it.

341
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:53,797
Hey!

342
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,926
I'll take all of these patients.
The whole list. All at once.

343
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:00,095
And as the first assistant.

344
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,263
All of these patients?

345
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,349
You know they're all Dr. Cha's patients.

346
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:08,019
That explains why there's a lot.
A packed monthly schedule.

347
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:12,232
It's a lot. But each case
has its own challenges.

348
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,651
We should wait until Dr. Cha wakes up.

349
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,861
I heard he's showing some improvement.

350
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:20,198
Patients can't wait even though
doctors can wait for a patient.

351
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,491
That's touching.

352
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,952
It's a great quote. But…

353
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,664
Has the chairman said anything to you
at home?

354
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:32,460
Well, my grandpa is always wishing

355
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:36,381
that the Cardiology Department will keep
making big strides in helping patients.

356
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:40,343
He thinks highly of you, Dr. Ban.

357
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:41,803
He does?

358
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,515
Your house is in that direction, right?

359
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:46,891
Thank you, Sir.

360
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:50,687
A patient can't wait for the doctor.

361
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,564
I'll gather all the doctors tomorrow.

362
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,025
You really didn't know?

363
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,528
No, I had no idea.

364
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:02,198
You told me that it's up to Heaven's will.
But now you're backtracking.

365
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:06,369
I was explaining Heaven's will
in an entirely different context.

366
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,539
Wait, what's that tone I'm hearing?

367
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:11,124
I've been told by you

368
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,001
that I would not be able to wake up

369
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,503
if I keep entering someone's body.

370
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:19,507
Then you told me I was shortening my life.

371
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:24,220
Oh, boy. You were counting that?
Guess I was wrong.

372
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,055
And congrats. Lucky you.

373
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:30,059
You're backpedaling after telling me
false information and that's okay?

374
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,061
You know that's a crime.

375
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,354
It's a crime now?

376
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,857
Gosh, people are so harsh now.

377
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,444
Do you know how worried I was
about myself?

378
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:43,865
It was very upsetting.

379
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,408
Anyway…

380
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,119
Heaven's will has changed.

381
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:51,790
And it's Heaven's will
that I wake up from my coma.

382
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,293
So when whenever we meet,
repeat those words.

383
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,629
I'll try.

384
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:03,635
That punk.

385
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,138
I've never seen this happen before.

386
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,810
Did Heaven's will really change for him?

387
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,646
Well, rules are meant to be broken.

388
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,732
You should've told me then.

389
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:21,820
Give him the AED twice a day,
morning and evening.

390
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,112
The mannitol and dexamethasone,
give the doses twice today,

391
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,156
reduce after then,
and zero the day after tomorrow.

392
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,492
And increase his choline alfoscerate
to three times a day.

393
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:28,451
Okay, Doctor.

394
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,537
It's great news.

395
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,830
Congratulations.

396
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,165
It's just the beginning.

397
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,875
Please help me more.

398
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:37,627
Bye.

399
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,190
You liked hiking
more than visiting beaches.

400
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:02,110
Remember we promised to visit the Alps?

401
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:06,322
After I wake up, let's go on a drive
before autumn ends.

402
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,449
It'll be so nice. And we'll drive…

403
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,535
Wait, I'll have to buy a car.

404
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,120
I earn a lot.

405
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,539
You're holding onto my bankbook, right?

406
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,709
Let's go no matter what.

407
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,752
Not vicariously through others.

408
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,045
Not in our dreams.

409
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:31,139
What are you doing here?
We've got work to do.

410
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,641
Don't do what?

411
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,311
After your brainwaves spiked,
you're slacking off.

412
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,991
I'm not slacking off.
Is there something I need to do?

413
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,912
Have you had lunch?

414
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,247
No, I don't have an appetite.

415
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,791
No, you mustn't skip your meals.

416
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,128
Mr. Kim?

417
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:06,424
You were given one job to do.
You have to do it properly.

418
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,509
Oh, he's so clumsy.

419
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,470
Se-jin, never mind him. Just carry on.

420
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,348
I wish I could kill him.

421
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:32,659
I'll do a continuous suture for the valve.
Once we have the size 25mm,

422
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,077
give me a Prolene 4-0.

423
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,793
Is Dr. Cha showing any improvements?

424
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:45,129
Not yet. It doesn't happen that quickly.

425
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,632
I guess that's why he's still lying here.

426
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,176
He needs more happy hormones.

427
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,308
We don't have time to slack off!

428
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,228
Okay.

429
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,155
You're still the same.

430
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,408
Hey, Seung-tak. Don't I look blurry?

431
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,575
No, my vision is 20/20.

432
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:51,154
What about Seung-tak's surgical skills?
Does it make sense?

433
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,115
It was a 12-hour operation.

434
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:55,992
And the patient was Dr. Cha's.

435
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:58,077
Most of the operations Seung-tak did

436
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,747
were very challenging ones
even for senior doctors.

437
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:03,541
A few of them could only be performed
by Dr. Cha himself.

438
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:06,753
If it's not Dr. Cha in there,
then how can you explain

439
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,880
Seung-tak's surgical skills?

440
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,843
I see pericardial thickening.

441
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,678
We'll start with the stay sutures.

442
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,221
Give me two black silk 2-0.

443
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,761
If I had shown up that day,

444
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,641
would things have turned out differently?

445
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,990
Don't forget I'm in someone else's body.

446
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,911
Let's control myself and think wisely.

447
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:40,096
-What are you doing on the floor?
-Me?

448
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,597
Leg exercises.

449
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,975
Heart surgeons need good stamina.

450
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,603
You're looking more like a surgeon now.

451
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,105
You seem to like being one.

452
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:53,818
I heard you've done amazing things.
Everyone is praising you.

453
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,612
-When you're just a first-year resident.
-Praise?

454
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,447
For my operations?

455
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,950
The senior doctors were the lead surgeons.

456
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,870
I didn't do them.
I'm just the first assistant.

457
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,748
I'm busy so I must go. As a first-year…

458
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,376
That condition you had…

459
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,920
When you were young.

460
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:18,009
Do you still see strange things nowadays?

461
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,719
Strange things?

462
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,345
Like what?

463
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,016
You're not seeing Dr. Cha's spirit,

464
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,018
are you?

465
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:31,230
Could the doctor possess your body
and perform those operations?

466
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:33,774
That's absurd.

467
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:38,196
Being an administrative director
seems like a cushy job.

468
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,157
You have time
to talk about foolish stuff like that.

469
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,951
I heard Dr. Cha is showing improvement.

470
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:46,537
So?

471
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:48,497
Are you scared?

472
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:53,044
You should be after what you did to him.

473
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,421
You have proof?

474
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:56,714
Right now.

475
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,175
I see that you're nervous.

476
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,220
You're calculating
whether it's better for you

477
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,679
if Dr. Cha were to wake up or maybe not.

478
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,056
Hey, Seung-tak.

479
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,557
You should pray he wakes up.

480
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,851
That would lessen your punishment.

481
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,229
The truth will always be revealed.

482
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:31,207
In anatomy class, he ran out
and couldn't even hold a scalpel.

483
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,043
He skipped all the following anatomy
classes by making excuses.

484
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:37,129
Everyone at his med school knew about it.

485
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,966
He's an expert in medical theory
but can't do basic surgery.

486
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:47,598
Hey, Seung-tak.

487
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,101
What are you doing?

488
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,564
Sun-ho, stand in as first assistant.

489
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,573
Cut.

490
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:08,577
Cut.

491
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,712
It was you that night, wasn't it?

492
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,798
You appeared in my dreams?

493
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,261
I heard you humming a tune.

494
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,639
That song…

495
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,811
was our favorite song.

496
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,370
Only you and I know it.

497
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,424
Doctor, I came again.

498
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,468
I brought you a warm soup.

499
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,553
It's a western-style meal.

500
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:26,155
Why do you always have to eat hot stew?

501
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:28,449
I wanted to have a steak.

502
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:33,120
It was going to be my treat.
Do we have to eat stew?

503
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:36,832
Hey, you said
doctors need to have a warm heart.

504
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:40,336
When I eat a hot stew, it warms my soul.

505
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,296
Like soul food.

506
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,299
Soul food, no way.

507
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:50,388
Hey, this stew is so refreshing.

508
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:53,265
Mister, enough with the lame commentary.

509
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,184
How about we also have a bottle of soju?

510
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:56,394
Ma'am!

511
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,229
Hey, don't drink.

512
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,731
You can't even hold your beer.

513
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:03,317
-One bottle of soju.
-No, cancel that.

514
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:07,154
Eat the beef.
Stop filling yourself with the broth.

515
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,614
They have a steamed beef dish.

516
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:10,699
Ma'am, we'll order the steamed beef dish.

517
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:19,792
EUNSANG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

518
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,213
Did you sleep well?

519
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,383
Why didn't you just come in?

520
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,803
I waited here
because I didn't want to wake you.

521
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,304
So you could sleep.

522
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,598
What's going on?
There's something you need, right?

523
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:38,352
You don't have any surgeries
scheduled today. You need some rest.

524
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,521
And you've got a weak body
and constitution.

525
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,607
Are you worried
that I'll die from overwork?

526
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,443
If that worries you,
wake up from your coma sooner.

527
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:51,490
You're slacking off already?

528
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,492
We have work to do, you know.

529
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:56,912
We do? If you insist, then let's work.

530
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,622
You have a job to do.

531
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,666
A new patient? Where?

532
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,877
No, not a living patient.

533
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:06,088
Can I ask you for a favor?

534
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,966
Please look after those guys.

535
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:12,428
They kept me company
when you weren't around.

536
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:20,269
Oh, gosh.

537
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:28,360
They have personal stories
just like we all do.

538
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,615
Who else can do them favors except you?

539
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:44,126
HANKUK WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY
CENTRAL LIBRARY

540
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,296
Did I wash my hair?

541
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:52,051
Could I ask you
why you're looking to borrow this book?

542
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,220
Someone asked me for a favor.

543
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:58,057
He became very academically inclined
as he values life more.

544
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,851
Which college does he teach at?

545
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,937
He's not a college professor.
He's a doctor.

546
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,397
He's a doctor?

547
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:10,736
That's the book.

548
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,240
L'idée de temps-Cours au Collège
de France 1901-1902.

549
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,368
It's not a medical textbook?

550
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,036
No.

551
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,330
French philosopher Henri Bergson wrote it.

552
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:24,583
It's a collection of lectures he gave

553
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,586
about time at College de France
for two years from 1901 to 1902.

554
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,804
He wanted to read this?

555
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:41,684
Don't think he's got the intellect
to read this. It's in French.

556
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:44,103
What? You borrowed the book?

557
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,854
It was hard to find this book.

558
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,441
What? It's Bergson's book.

559
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:59,535
My hand slipped.

560
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,787
So you do have a little kindness
in your heart.

561
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,080
Or you believe you won't wake up?

562
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,040
Do you feel compassion for us now?

563
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:08,127
Why are you saying that?
He came back with her book.

564
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:09,795
What about me?

565
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:11,922
When will you do a favor for me?

566
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,592
Favor?

567
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,727
It's more like a library in there.

568
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,478
Lim Bo-mi. 29 years old.

569
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,272
She was a Ph.D candidate.

570
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:34,653
A Ph.D candidate?
No wonder the book was so…

571
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:35,654
Do you remember that time?

572
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:37,281
Your first day at work.

573
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,158
We were doing the rounds.

574
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:41,910
Why stick with terminal patients
at the expense of other patients?

575
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:44,455
I wonder why they're
holding on so desperately

576
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:47,124
as if they have
a great life ahead of them?

577
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:49,251
One should know to let go when it's time.

578
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:51,670
I said those things.

579
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:54,673
I gave up on coma patients
who had no hope.

580
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,509
But now I'm in a coma.

581
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,888
Why am I clinging to life
as if I lived a great life?

582
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:03,515
I agree.

583
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,808
What?

584
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,478
Saving patients
is not the only thing there is.

585
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:10,773
You have to clear your debts,
change your ways and be charitable.

586
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:12,524
You don't have to do all of that.

587
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,319
All right. Let's use a two-prong strategy.

588
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:17,821
We interact with both people
and terminal patients.

589
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:21,992
Wait a minute.

590
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,243
Change my ways?

591
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,287
What's wrong with my character?

592
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,331
Hey!

593
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:30,167
She was preparing to defend her thesis
and worked too hard.

594
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,544
She suffered from a lack of sleep.

595
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,213
And hit her head after fainting.

596
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:35,798
And then?

597
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,718
Based on her brain scans,
there were no bleeding or fractures.

598
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:41,345
We thought she'd recover soon.

599
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:42,262
But…

600
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:46,475
she hasn't and has been in a coma.

601
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:48,686
You don't know why?

602
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,230
Well, that's…

603
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:55,192
We did several follow-up CTs, MRI scans,
and EEGs. Even a Brain SPECT.

604
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:57,694
We couldn't pinpoint anything.

605
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:01,198
But why are you
suddenly interested in her?

606
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,408
Is she a friend?

607
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:04,701
Will you pay more attention to her then?

608
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,453
Okay. Let's say she's a friend.

609
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:07,830
I'll borrow this.

610
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:12,167
You stayed up all night
writing your thesis and then fainted?

611
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:15,212
Were you on any medication?
What did you eat?

612
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:18,590
Did you have any conditions?
Do you remember anything?

613
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,885
I had a nosebleed right before.

614
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:23,554
A nosebleed?

615
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:25,889
My nose frequently bleeds.

616
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,684
On that day, the bleeding wouldn't stop.

617
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:31,270
So I stuffed tissues in my nose
for a while and then stood up,

618
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:35,023
and I got dizzy.

619
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,069
What is it this time?

620
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,029
It's a patient's chart.

621
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,239
The patient suffered a concussion.

622
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:44,783
But didn't have any internal bleeding
or fractures.

623
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,910
I wonder why she's been in a coma
for three months.

624
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,370
Why are you showing me this?

625
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:52,166
Because you're the doctor
I trust the most at this hospital.

626
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,626
Hey now.

627
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,546
-You can't flirt with her.
-What?

628
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:02,384
Her nose bled a lot
on the day she collapsed. I assume…

629
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,802
-An infection.
-Right.

630
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,220
Check if she has an underlying condition.

631
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:06,472
What are you saying?

632
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:10,225
Before she collapsed, her nose bled.
A lot. She suffered from nose bleeding.

633
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:14,897
It says here,
she has a condition called HHT.

634
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,273
Such patients will suffer
from nose bleeding.

635
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:22,905
She might

636
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,199
have a spinal infection.

637
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,409
Okay. I'm counting on you.

638
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,161
Let's go.
We need to collect happy hormones.

639
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:30,287
Wait. Dr. Koh.

640
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,747
That was meant for me.

641
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,957
Don't misunderstand that.
Take the patient's case.

642
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,835
Hey, come back here.
Why were you flirting with her?

643
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,087
Hey, Seung-tak. I saw you flirting.

644
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:40,339
What was that wink you gave her?

645
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,479
Dr. Jang. What is the meaning of this?

646
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,773
Why are you examining the patient
without my permission?

647
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:03,153
Is this allowed in U.S. hospitals?
You don't have any protocol?

648
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:06,198
Doctor. I noticed that you left out
a spinal tap exam.

649
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:07,658
What?

650
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:09,785
Why would that be necessary?

651
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:12,496
Before the patient collapsed,
she had a nosebleed.

652
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,374
I don't think you suspected
any infections.

653
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:18,335
Even though she has an HHT condition.

654
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,921
What nosebleed? There were no signs.

655
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,131
Who said that? I wasn't told of that.

656
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,344
Her mom found her on the floor.

657
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:29,179
Nobody saw her nose bleeding.

658
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,807
The patient couldn't have told you
since she's in a coma.

659
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,017
How did you know about this?

660
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,436
Now that you know,
check the test results later.

661
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,564
And put her on a regimen of antibiotics.

662
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:52,494
Yes, I'm coming.

663
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:37,581
What? Who is she?
She's staring so long at him.

664
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:40,792
She's a visiting doctor. Dr. Jang Se-jin.

665
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,754
She's in charge of Dr. Cha's care.

666
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,672
She's his primary care physician?

667
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:04,691
Dr. Jang!

668
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:16,703
How's it going?

669
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:20,415
Crystal.

670
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,421
I want a reward. No more slapping.

671
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:28,382
There's no time for that.
We have a patient waiting. Come on.

672
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:29,508
Help me get these off.

673
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:31,593
Do it yourself.

674
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:32,803
My hands are sweaty.

675
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:35,806
Oh, gosh.

676
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,355
Seung-tak and Soo-jung.
They're dating or something.

677
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:46,358
Seung-tak comes to ER
whenever he has time.

678
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:48,193
Soo-jung pages him so much every day.

679
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:53,907
Oh, gosh.

680
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,037
Where is he?

681
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,957
Are you looking for someone?

682
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:12,968
There's no one around.

683
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,722
-Who are you looking for?
-Guess I was looking for you.

684
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:17,889
Since it's just the two of us.

685
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:20,517
I thought about what you said yesterday.

686
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:22,644
Yesterday?

687
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:24,813
What did I say?

688
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:25,814
You don't remember?

689
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:27,899
In front of the operating room.

690
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:28,942
We talked

691
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,069
in front of the operating room?

692
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:35,031
What did we talk about?

693
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:37,075
Probably not about me asking you
to treat me to dinner.

694
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,326
You really

695
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,829
don't remember?

696
00:50:42,038 --> 00:50:44,499
I'm not myself these days.

697
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:46,418
Let me see.

698
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,754
I think I faintly remember.

699
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:55,302
I'm getting calls all day.
So it's hard to keep track.

700
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:02,350
Forget that. So did you make a decision?

701
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:04,352
What?

702
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,605
Whether it's better for you
if Dr. Cha wakes or doesn't.

703
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:12,110
Think about it deeply
while anxiety creeps up on you.

704
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,488
There's not a lot of time.

705
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:15,822
Bye.

706
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,742
I'm so frazzled.

707
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,579
Dr. Cha has been reporting to me
what he does when he's in my body.

708
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,090
He's toying with me.

709
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:39,179
You claim Dr. Cha possesses
Seung-tak's body?

710
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,097
I can't believe I believed that.

711
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,935
Because of you I almost believed it.

712
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:46,853
It's my fault, too.

713
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:50,357
If you keep this up, you'll never
be a doctor at our hospital again.

714
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:52,567
Understand?

715
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:55,070
You and your crazy theory.

716
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,532
Allow me to prove it.

717
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,416
What now?

718
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,211
I'll prove that Seung-tak
is actually Dr. Cha.

719
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,963
before your own eyes.

720
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:23,056
What are you saying? You'll do what?

721
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,517
External ventricular drainage.

722
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,853
Since the antibiotic treatment
is not working,

723
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:30,647
I suggest we inject the antibiotics
directly into her brain.

724
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,482
And in high doses.

725
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:35,360
Instead of using vancomycin or meropenem,

726
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:37,487
we should use colistin, which is stronger.

727
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,197
That's used as a last resort.

728
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:42,367
It's a high-risk procedure
for the patient.

729
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:43,785
Her vitals are stable, aren't they?

730
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:47,205
What if the patient dies
after we administer colistin?

731
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:48,498
Are there any alternatives?

732
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,250
There are none.
That's why we have to try this.

733
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,835
I'll take on the patient.

734
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,086
Now, look here, Dr. Jang!

735
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:56,840
Actually, Dr. Koh asked me
to take over the patient's care.

736
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:58,550
Dr. Koh?

737
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,262
Then she is a friend of his?

738
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:04,055
Schedule the operation soon.

739
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,266
I'll talk to her family.

740
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:07,517
Is it true?

741
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,102
Will Bo-mi be able to wake up

742
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:10,979
if she receives that surgery?

743
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:13,273
We'll know for certain
after the operation.

744
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,483
We'll then treat her with drugs then.

745
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:18,570
It's a risky procedure,
but it's the best option

746
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:20,071
we have right now.

747
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:22,866
I'm glad to hear there's a way.

748
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:25,994
It's better than just waiting
without any hope.

749
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:28,371
Thank you, Doctor.

750
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,789
Thank you so much.

751
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:32,959
Bo-mi.

752
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,044
You can wake up.

753
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,632
They found a way. Good for you!

754
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:40,050
It's wonderful.

755
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:45,805
Great news.

756
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:02,948
Are you upset?

757
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,408
Why would I be upset?

758
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,036
It's good news for you.

759
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:12,082
If I had known this would happen,
I would've asked him for the DVD.

760
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:16,544
They're not sure if I'll wake up or not.

761
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:18,713
Don't say that.

762
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:20,006
Don’t be like that.

763
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,341
Of course, you'll wake up.

764
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:25,345
Thanks for your help.

765
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,681
I was so overwhelmed with anxiety.

766
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:30,100
Thanks to you, I got through it.

767
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:32,435
I won't forget

768
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:34,771
how kind you were to me.

769
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:35,897
Just forget us.

770
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:37,649
Put this behind you

771
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:40,068
and don't go back to living timidly.

772
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:42,904
Be confident and enjoy life.

773
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:45,740
Don't have such pale skin due
to studying indoors all the time.

774
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:47,534
You

775
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:49,160
are so pretty.

776
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,963
I wish for you to wake up, too,
my good-looking friend.

777
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:03,717
And reach your dreams.

778
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:05,760
Well, I'll…

779
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:26,031
Be on our toes.

780
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:27,407
We have a complex surgery.

781
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,492
Why should I be on my toes?
You'll be doing it.

782
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:31,077
Are you nervous?

783
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:33,788
Me? The one and only Dr. Cha?

784
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:36,374
Be on your toes.
It's a complex surgery, you know.

785
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,586
Let's go collect happy hormones.

786
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:40,503
Let's go.

787
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:23,880
Seung-tak.

788
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:26,633
It's you, right?

789
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:29,219
What are you doing here?

790
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:32,263
Do you know this patient?
You should've told me.

791
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,599
It is you, Seung-tak.

792
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:38,269
I heard about what is going on.

793
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:40,855
Why didn't you come and talk to me?

794
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:44,359
Why switch places like that?
Isn't it bothersome?

795
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:48,863
Do the surgery on your own today.

796
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:50,740
I'm a first-year resident.

797
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,367
So I can't be the lead surgeon.

798
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:54,035
You'll do most of the surgery anyway.

799
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:57,122
What are you up to now?

800
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:14,472
I used my authority to include him
in this operation.

801
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:16,224
That's Dr. Cha's patient, I heard.

802
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:20,770
Since Dr. Ahn has experience in this
procedure, I asked him to join you.

803
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:22,480
As an assisting surgeon.

804
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:24,732
It's been a while, Seung-tak.

805
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:27,068
Let's do our best.

806
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:31,531
Seung-tak, calm down.

807
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:33,074
We're in an operating room.

808
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,075
Trust me.

809
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:37,203
We'll save the patient first.

810
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:54,512
DR. AHN TAE-HYUN

811
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,606
I've worked together with Dr. Cha
for seven years.

812
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,275
I've assisted him in all of his surgeries.

813
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,403
I know how Dr. Cha operates
in the operating room

814
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:12,530
better than anyone else.

815
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:37,722
I didn't notice it at first.

816
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:42,060
He would flex his wrists before operating.

817
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,147
That's…

818
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:47,857
what Dr. Cha always does

819
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:51,069
before he operates to loosen up.

820
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:58,201
We'll begin the cardiac myxoma procedure.

821
00:58:58,284 --> 00:58:59,160
Scalpel.

822
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,038
This cardia myxoma procedure

823
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,083
is in the same area as Chairman Jang.

824
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:08,336
I'm sure I'll be able
to spot similarities.

825
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:15,593
Saw.

826
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:42,996
Koh Seung-tak?

827
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:45,456
I've never heard of that name before.

828
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:48,293
I know all of Bo-mi's friends.

829
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,132
Dr. Jang.

830
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:09,689
-We'll remove the heart now. Be alert.
-Yes, Doctor.

831
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:27,457
Hey, pull it right.

832
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,625
Do the suction right.

833
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,543
Will you fix it if the mitral is damaged?

834
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,170
If the mitral is damaged, will you fix it?

835
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:33,296
Get your act together!

836
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,976
Prolene 4-0, large needle, french.

837
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:03,910
He'll always do seven to eight motions
when tying.

838
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:09,582
On the second motion,
Dr. Cha will always use his left hand.

839
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,377
Just for the second motion.

840
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:39,404
In a previous cardiac sarcoma operation,

841
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:42,115
Dr. Cha accidentally touched the cannula

842
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,283
and air got in.

843
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:46,911
The patient's blood pressure dropped.
We almost lost him.

844
01:01:46,994 --> 01:01:48,996
What? When did I do that?

845
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:53,126
Dr. Cha.

846
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:04,262
I wasn't there so I don't know.

847
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,514
Focus on the operation, Dr. Ahn.

848
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,726
You know this isn't a simple procedure.

849
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:15,815
And I know you're listening over there.
So please leave.

850
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,567
You're interfering with the surgery.

851
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:19,402
Same goes for you, Dr. Jang.

852
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,240
Did you not hear me?

853
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:26,284
I want both of you
out of my operating room!

854
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:55,938
Hey, you're Dr. Cha all right.

855
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:03,946
You completed the surgery successfully
despite the circumstances.

856
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,073
You're an amazing doctor.

857
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,871
I should've caught on sooner.

858
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:16,334
How is this possible?

859
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:19,212
It's actually happening.

860
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:22,089
What?

861
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:26,469
You're going to pretend again?

862
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:28,638
Or did you leave his body already?

863
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:32,350
No.

864
01:03:34,018 --> 01:03:36,479
I'm still here.

865
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:38,481
Inside the body of your cousin

866
01:03:38,564 --> 01:03:40,691
whom you love dearly.

867
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:50,284
Yes, you're correct.

868
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,205
I'm Cha Young-min.

869
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,261
-Are you crazy? Why did you reveal that?
-Hey, I'm sorry.

870
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:52,221
I put on a great performance though.

871
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,598
That's just great.

872
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:55,433
He saw and heard.

873
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:57,226
They're glaring at me openly.
Both of them.

874
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:58,603
I'm always the one

875
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:01,314
-to clean up the mess you make.
-What is going on here right now?

876
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:02,481
Did you collect some happy hormones?

877
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:03,858
I did.

878
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:05,401
He…

879
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:06,819
is a lot like you.

880
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,446
Doctor.

881
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:12,283
-You came alone? Where's Dr. Cha?
-He's a young kid. Let me operate on him.

882
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:14,619
What would happen if Dr. Cha were to die?

883
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:22,919
