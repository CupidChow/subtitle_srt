1
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:43,793
Yes, Dad?

2
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,754
Oh, not yet.

3
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,465
They say we'll have to wait.

4
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,016
No.

5
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,559
No!

6
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,194
You…

7
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,157
can see me?

8
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,289
Yes.

9
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:05,959
I can see you.

10
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,428
The patient's blood pressure is falling.
Dr. Koh, we're waiting.

11
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,811
All right. Let's get started
with the surgery.

12
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:52,589
Who permitted him to do this procedure?
Dr. Ahn is crazy.

13
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,091
His blood pressure is dropping!

14
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:57,010
Dr. Koh, start operating!

15
00:02:57,093 --> 00:03:00,221
The patient will go into cardiac arrest
if he doesn't act fast.

16
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,349
We can't let that happen at this hospital.

17
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,441
Seung-tak, move aside.

18
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,652
You move aside.

19
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,032
Sun-ho. You're my first assistant.

20
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,787
What do you think you're doing?

21
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,831
Dr. Ahn, you're lucky
we're in an operating room.

22
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,041
Get out of my sight.

23
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,709
I'm not letting you operate
on this patient.

24
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,169
Sun-ho, I gave you an order!

25
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,721
Why you, punk…

26
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,890
Dr. Ahn Tae-hyun.

27
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,351
Do you believe you have the right
to treat patients?

28
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,895
Can't you see the patient is critical?

29
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,732
-Get out.
-What are you two doing?

30
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,525
Are you going to let the patient die?

31
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,842
We don't have time.
Let's do this quickly. Scalpel.

32
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,935
Bovie.

33
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,901
Why aren't you holding it back?

34
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:39,946
Army navy retractor.

35
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,620
Sternal saw.

36
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,757
Tweezers.

37
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,304
-Suction.
-Suction.

38
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,641
-Sun-ho.
-I said suction.

39
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,394
Suction.

40
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,706
Why are you lying in this bed

41
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,751
when you should be operating on patients?

42
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,754
How long are you going to be in a coma?

43
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:57,940
Dr. Koh is operating
on a tamponade patient right now.

44
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,358
Dr. Koh?

45
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,444
Tamponade is…

46
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,363
Yes. That's the same injury Dr. Cha had.

47
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,866
And Dr. Cha is
still in a coma because of that.

48
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:11,329
I don't know why Dr. Koh
is handling the same case again

49
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,040
when he's only a first-year resident
and other doctors are here.

50
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,209
It's baffling.

51
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,672
Do something, Dr. Koh!

52
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,682
Cut.

53
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,106
Cut.

54
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,485
Dr. Lee, you can finish it from here.

55
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,660
I saved the patient as you asked.

56
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,538
Dr. Lee will take it from here.
Follow me outside.

57
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,083
Hey, stop right there.

58
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,128
Seung-tak, come back!

59
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,297
Seung-tak.

60
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,591
You punk.

61
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,059
Can a first-year resident

62
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,145
do that?

63
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,272
No, it's not possible.

64
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,815
It's impossible.

65
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,651
A first-year resident
can do a cannulation at best.

66
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,112
If they're good,
they can barely perform that.

67
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,449
Has anyone ever done this before?

68
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,660
Yes, there was one instance.
When Dr. Cha was an intern.

69
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:18,289
-Yes, that's right, there was.
-Yes, everyone talked about it.

70
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,418
But how could he?

71
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:26,923
Seung-tak!

72
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:30,176
You can see me, right?
Why are you pretending that you can't?

73
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,762
You see my hand, right? You can see it!

74
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,306
Talk to me, you punk.
You can see my hand, right?

75
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,683
Look up at the ceiling.

76
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:43,981
So what?

77
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,608
Why do you care about that?

78
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,111
You can see me, right?

79
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:58,955
Remember this place?

80
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,207
You entered my body
and scared Dr. Ahn pretty good.

81
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:02,875
You…

82
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,379
Since when could you see me? When was it?

83
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,966
I don't know. Ever since that day…
It was just my luck.

84
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,178
Since the day I became a ghost?

85
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,558
Then why didn't you tell me?
Why did you pretend you couldn't?

86
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,602
You never asked whether I could see you.

87
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,145
-Why would I tell you?
-Is it just me then?

88
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,648
Do you also see the other ghosts?

89
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,117
Hope Dr. Cha pays attention to me today.

90
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,873
-Excuse…
-He's ignoring us again.

91
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,543
Like he always does.

92
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,919
Why did I get my hopes up?

93
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,754
I wonder why they're
holding on so desperately

94
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,256
as if they have
a great life ahead of them?

95
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,426
One should know to let go when it's time.

96
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:54,427
Don't you agree?

97
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:56,887
-Why you!
-Hey.

98
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,347
That piece of…

99
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,474
-Don't.
-Let go. I'll kill him.

100
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,059
Don't do it.

101
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,357
Because of you,
I almost got possessed by others.

102
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,318
It makes me mad just thinking about it.

103
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,529
Have they stopped bullying you?
You should have been nicer to them.

104
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,951
You were able to see ghosts all along?

105
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,870
From the very beginning…

106
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,038
Since when?

107
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,876
Let's just say you're the 250th spirit
I've seen so far.

108
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,878
Hey, don't label me as a spirit.

109
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,129
Just call me a ghost.

110
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,175
No. That's my prerogative.
I can call you whatever I like.

111
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,135
You're a spirit.
Why can't I call you that?

112
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,303
Fine. Let's move on.

113
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,721
How did you end up seeing ghosts?

114
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,389
I mean, ghosts, not spirits.

115
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,141
That's a private matter.

116
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,477
Hold it right there.

117
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,811
I don't like the tone
you're taking with me.

118
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,396
Hey, punk. I'm a senior doctor.

119
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,857
Does that really matter right now?

120
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,610
Okay. So why did you reveal
your secret now?

121
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:55,446
-You were pretending until now.
-To save the patient.

122
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,823
I don't like seeing people die.

123
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:01,410
So that's why you've been using me?

124
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,745
You could see me all along. Why?

125
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,456
You didn't have
anything better to do anyway.

126
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,209
-I did it for your sake.
-I'm so grateful for that.

127
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,794
You wanted to keep me busy?

128
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:13,756
Did you think I'd be touched
by your kind consideration?

129
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,341
I know how you think, you punk.

130
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,842
You don't know me.

131
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,969
Wait a minute.

132
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:22,139
Did you go to my place on your own?

133
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,808
That?

134
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:27,019
I went to see if anyone was there
since you kept calling for "your baby."

135
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:31,774
Is it refreshing?

136
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,152
There's no one at home
to give water to my baby.

137
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,906
Mandu, I'll come get you soon.

138
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:41,409
Instead of my baby, I'll take you.

139
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,660
Come here, Seung-tak.

140
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:43,619
Come here.

141
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,333
I didn't want to see you mope,
so I nudged you a bit.

142
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,043
But you were out to get me.

143
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,297
Do you know Dr. Cha's home address?

144
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,218
So that's why I haven't seen him around.

145
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,762
You're his colleague, right?

146
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:05,724
Take what he needs.
Make sure you lock the door behind you.

147
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:26,454
So this is where he spends
the money he makes as a surgeon.

148
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,165
It's a modest apartment.

149
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:43,429
This is "his baby"? This thing?

150
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:47,766
Was he dead?

151
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,393
Your baby is a hardy survivor.

152
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,896
Somehow, I saved your life
and also your pet's.

153
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,358
I'm so relieved. So where is he?
Where did you put him?

154
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,069
I rescued your pet
and I don't even get a thank-you?

155
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,780
Then Doctor, where did you
take my baby? Tell me.

156
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,617
Are you asking me right now?
What are we, friends?

157
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,535
You've been asking me questions too.

158
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,539
I don't like your tone.

159
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,082
Now look here, you punk.

160
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,502
I don't like being called "punk."
I was going to bring that up.

161
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:15,753
You don't know me.

162
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,171
Just call me by my name.

163
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,172
Speak for yourself.

164
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,924
You said the accident was my fault
and being in a coma was my fate, too.

165
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,383
I'd like to punch you in the throat!

166
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,178
You're yelling at me?
I should be the one yelling.

167
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,888
You possess my body whenever you please.

168
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,139
Do you think I wanted to?

169
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,100
I sacrificed my pure soul
when I entered your body!

170
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,352
An arrogant prick like you!

171
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,562
You think I liked it then?
I almost struck my own body.

172
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,983
Your body isn't even that great.

173
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,153
You can't even use your fingers properly.
You're all talk.

174
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,864
At least I can talk like a doctor.
You can't even open your eyes.

175
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,577
How could you say such a thing to me?

176
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:52,039
I'll never possess you again.

177
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,499
I don't need you, you punk.

178
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,834
I'll let any other ghosts enter my body
except you.

179
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,712
Don't even try entering my body.
I'll smash your soul into pieces.

180
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,923
You keep taking that tone with me!

181
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:04,009
You bastard. How could you talk like that
to a senior doctor?

182
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,473
People never change.

183
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,058
Even when they're a ghost.

184
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,436
Your husband is no longer
in critical condition.

185
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,521
The operation was a success.

186
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,607
Doctor, my husband will live, right?

187
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,027
Thank you so much. Thank you, Doctor.

188
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,154
-Chae-hee, Dad is going to live.
-Really?

189
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,072
Yes.

190
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,283
Thank you, Doctor.

191
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:28,742
Thank you.

192
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,245
That bastard.

193
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,874
He pretended he couldn't see me.
He talks back to me.

194
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,500
Wait a minute.

195
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,545
He made me do the intubation for him.
How could he?

196
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,464
I don't have the time
to be saving other people's lives.

197
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,476
Hello.

198
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,104
I think that's the patient
Dr. Koh operated on.

199
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,356
I heard he did the procedure perfectly.

200
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,276
-How was that possible?
-He's just a first-year resident.

201
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,193
Unbelievable.

202
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,828
He did the surgery?

203
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,913
Yes, he did.

204
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,289
He did it.

205
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,585
I knew Seung-tak

206
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,588
was a brilliant student in med school.

207
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,007
But he's no armchair expert anymore.

208
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,092
Where did he learn to do that?

209
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,928
Blood pressure looks normal.
Pulse is okay.

210
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,679
-Amount of drained fluid?
-Amount of drained fluid?

211
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,182
It's 200cc.

212
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,143
Did you get the ABGA results?

213
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,062
Did he receive one-on-one training?

214
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,523
That's right. He studied in America.
That's where he learned it.

215
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,943
How's the ABGA result, you punks?

216
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,861
-Did we get the ABGA results back?
-Okay.

217
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:51,116
In Bourne Identity, Matt Damon's character
is a trained assassin.

218
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,285
And he has expert fighting skills.

219
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,954
Nice. The prognosis looks good.

220
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,415
Looks good. Check on him once every hour.

221
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:02,252
So Seung-tak must have received training
from the best surgeon

222
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,671
while he was studying in America.

223
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,839
That's how he became so good.

224
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,302
But why did he fumble Dr. Cha's operation?

225
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,390
Hey, Dr. Koh.

226
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:21,230
Don't give me that angry look.
I came to check the patient.

227
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,315
Patient's blood pressure, pulse,
and drained fluid are normal.

228
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,984
The ABGA results were good too.

229
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,822
I'm waiting. You were the lead surgeon.
So give the order.

230
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,163
Don't look at me.
I'm not going to help you with this.

231
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,541
Are we friends now?

232
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:45,796
I talked to the patient's family
so could you write up the OP record?

233
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,006
OPERATION RECORD

234
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,675
The operation record?

235
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,302
You don't know how to write one?

236
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,930
How would he know that?

237
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,432
He probably hasn't even seen one.

238
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:03,147
Dr. Ban says you have to stay
by the patient's side until he wakes up.

239
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,524
You know the reason for that.

240
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,619
Dr. Ahn, you're lucky
we're in an operating room.

241
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,288
Get out of my sight.

242
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,789
I'm not letting you operate
on this patient.

243
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,332
Dr. Ahn Tae-hyun.

244
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,711
Do you believe you have the right
to treat patients?

245
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,299
Dr. Ahn, are you out of your mind?

246
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,552
Why did you let Seung-tak
perform the operation?

247
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,346
-I'm sorry.
-It already happened.

248
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,015
Skip the explaining.

249
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,059
You better handle this.

250
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,437
-What?
-You're lucky the patient lived.

251
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,564
There were other surgeons available
in the hospital.

252
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,399
If anyone finds out
a first-year resident did surgery,

253
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,567
then we're in trouble.

254
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,570
There's already bad press
about surgeons switching places.

255
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:52,946
You won't be the only one.

256
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,740
This could damage our reputation.

257
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,201
Okay, Doctor.

258
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:01,872
Did you sense anything strange
about Seung-tak?

259
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,583
What? I don't follow…

260
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,586
What? Never mind.

261
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:11,465
The fact that Seung-tak performed
that surgery is strange in itself.

262
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,927
Hold on. Does that mean
Seung-tak is a genius?

263
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,012
A brilliant mind?

264
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,182
How does he become a genius overnight?

265
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,643
He was unremarkable during his internship.

266
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:23,852
An overnight genius?

267
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,729
Out of the blue?

268
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,955
This is the administrative director.

269
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,415
Cameras recorded
the No. 7 operating room, right?

270
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,252
Send me a copy of the footage. Right now.

271
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:03,392
Excuse me. If you're still around,
let's try to save her.

272
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,394
Since when could you see me?

273
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,728
When was it?

274
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:10,065
I don't know. Ever since that day…
It was just my luck.

275
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:16,488
It's uncomfortable being around you.
Could you leave?

276
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,532
That's my patient. I'm not going anywhere.

277
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:21,326
-If you don't like it, you can go.
-I was the lead surgeon.

278
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,078
-I did the surgery.
-Using my hands.

279
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,414
You can't even hold a scalpel.
You can't brag about that.

280
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,416
You can't treat a patient
in the physical world.

281
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,334
That was below the belt.
I'll pull out your tonsils

282
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,211
and pickle them in salt.

283
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,340
Sir, are you coming to?

284
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,842
Start with obeying commands. Say his name.

285
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,135
Mr. Moon Suk-joo?

286
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,305
-Blink eyes if that's correct.
-Blink your eyes if that's your name.

287
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,224
Mental okay.
Next, check his motor functions.

288
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,643
-Start with his left hand.
-Move your left hand.

289
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,522
Move your right hand.

290
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,651
-Good. Next…
-Do you remember your daughter's name?

291
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,863
Nod your head if you remember.

292
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,828
Your family is okay.
You don’t have to worry about them.

293
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,668
Chae-hee takes after you a lot.

294
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,385
Are you feeling okay?

295
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,638
Can you think clearly?

296
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,140
Dad.

297
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,392
Are you okay, Dad?

298
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,729
Dad says he's feeling okay.

299
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,507
Since when did he
care about patients so much?

300
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,385
He didn't perform the procedure. I did.

301
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,158
I'm sorry.

302
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,244
I had a situation.

303
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,746
I'll be more careful.

304
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,415
Young-min.

305
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,585
Dr. Koh operated on a tamponade patient.

306
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,549
The nurses tell me he did a good job.

307
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,095
He's quite a doctor, isn't he?

308
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,851
Why couldn't he do the same

309
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,895
when he operated on you?

310
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,564
I know.

311
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:02,404
But what kind of relationship
did you two have?

312
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:07,117
Dr. Koh says you hated each other.

313
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,953
But his behavior says otherwise.

314
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,122
You think so?

315
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:13,874
Anyway…

316
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,001
he's peculiar.

317
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,712
He's very peculiar.

318
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,508
I'll be joining your department
as a new resident.

319
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,636
My name is Koh Seung-tak.

320
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,141
Let's save the patient first.

321
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:33,727
Dr. Cha Young-min.

322
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:35,812
How did you end up seeing ghosts?

323
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,564
I mean, ghosts, not spirits.

324
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,149
That's a private matter.

325
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,861
How did he turn out like that?

326
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:50,952
Seung-tak.

327
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,454
You're home?

328
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,456
Did you take a cab?

329
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,250
-What about your car?
-What? Well…

330
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,461
I parked it at the hospital.
I was too tired to drive.

331
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,880
Why? Did something happen at work?

332
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:05,425
No. You look so pretty today, Mom.

333
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,339
Seung-tak!

334
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,511
Dad!

335
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,473
Dad!

336
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,267
Dad!

337
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,394
Dad!

338
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,193
The patient has a daughter?

339
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,029
Yes, sir. The girl is seven years old.

340
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,574
Fortunately, she was unharmed
in the car crash.

341
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,994
I'm happy to hear
that her dad regained consciousness.

342
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:17,581
Seung-tak performed the surgery perfectly
and the patient is doing well.

343
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,972
I clean this spot all the time.

344
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:37,809
I didn't intend to possess
his body yesterday.

345
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,313
But the patient's condition
became critical.

346
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:44,941
I couldn't allow Dr. Ahn to operate
on the patient.

347
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:48,653
Tess.

348
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:49,905
Oh my.

349
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,324
This mosquito.

350
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:53,992
I'm going to get you.

351
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,840
What are they thinking?

352
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,576
Wonderful, ain't it?

353
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,620
What? What are you doing here?

354
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,624
Dr. Koh. What is it?

355
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,713
I received this yesterday.

356
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,214
Illegal parking?

357
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,550
Someone parked my cars
next to a fire hydrant.

358
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:16,801
That comes with a hefty fine.

359
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,387
Sorry. I didn't notice the fire hydrant.

360
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,972
You can see the blue car parked nicely
next to the white car.

361
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,307
Now I have to pay a fine.

362
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,809
-Hold on a sec. What's your point?
-My point is that

363
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,605
Cha Young-min is self-centered,
arrogant, and lacks spatial awareness.

364
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,982
On top of that,
he has little regard for the laws.

365
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:32,817
Luckily, nothing serious happened.

366
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,986
If there was a fire, think about
how serious it would've been?

367
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,780
-A fire?
-Hey!

368
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:39,199
Let's talk about that later.

369
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:41,785
-Just you and me.
-You need to reassess your decision.

370
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:44,496
Would you want to invest
your incredible skills and time

371
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:47,165
on someone like this?

372
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:48,416
Bye.

373
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,293
Come back here!

374
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,128
You disrespectful punk.
I said come back here.

375
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,631
Seung-tak! What was that about?

376
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:56,424
Seung-tak!

377
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:59,219
-Seung-tak.
-What is that?

378
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,471
He's really weird.

379
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,308
You punk.

380
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,143
How could you talk about me
behind my back?

381
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:10,063
I said it in your presence.
It wasn't behind your back.

382
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:11,773
I have little regard for morals?

383
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,691
Because I’m in this state you mock me?

384
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:17,028
Even when you were in your body,
I didn't have high regard for you.

385
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:20,657
Look, people make mistakes.

386
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,951
I didn't know I parked
next to the fire hydrant.

387
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,787
And there was no fire.
You recovered your car.

388
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,330
Can't you look at it positively?

389
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,833
Anyway, you found your babies,
so bring my baby to me.

390
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,876
Because you parked my cars
next to a hydrant,

391
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,044
the fine is one million won.

392
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,465
All right. Just bring back my baby.

393
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,718
Pay up first if you want to see your pet.

394
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,553
You're taking my pet hostage?

395
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,972
How can I possibly pay you?

396
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,642
Excuse me. Are you Dr. Koh?

397
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,563
Let me call you back.

398
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,315
What is this about?

399
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,526
I write medical articles
for the Jaemin Daily.

400
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,321
I'd like to learn more
about the operation you did yesterday.

401
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,115
Is it true

402
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:05,910
that you single-handedly saved a trauma
patient's life in an impossible situation?

403
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,873
"Young heart surgeon at Eunsang Hospital

404
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:12,333
performs remarkable
open-heart surgery alone

405
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,085
to save a trauma patient."

406
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,880
Even the senior surgeon
can't do that alone. But Dr. Koh did?

407
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:23,094
"When the lead surgeon
could not carry out the surgery

408
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:27,515
due to a sprained wrist,
Dr. Koh stepped in

409
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,393
and showed tremendous skill

410
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,937
in saving the patient's life."

411
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:34,564
Which doctor was it?

412
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:37,275
They shouldn't have been there
if they were injured.

413
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:40,570
"A personal tragedy Dr. Koh
experienced in childhood

414
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:43,948
was the reason why he courageously
operated on the patient."

415
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,035
Do you know anything about that?

416
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,077
What?

417
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,412
No, I don't.

418
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,707
"He deserves praise
for his passion and skill."

419
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:56,544
"He's a hero and an amazing doctor.
I support him."

420
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,630
I told the staff not to
leak the incident to the press.

421
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,173
What is going on?

422
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:03,885
This solved the incident in one swoop.

423
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,304
Was this your idea, Doctor?

424
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,475
Did you call the press?

425
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,646
We have to spread news like this.

426
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,147
That's why I'm here.

427
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:20,235
Geez. You tried to sabotage his career,
but now you're promoting him?

428
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,945
I don't think that would do any good.

429
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:25,657
There's been a scandal about surgeons
switching places to save costs.

430
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:29,452
That was about uncertified doctors.
But you're certified.

431
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:34,165
You're surprising me
with your God-given talent.

432
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:37,335
Where do I report an invasion of privacy?

433
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,087
"Privacy"?

434
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,257
What? That personal tragedy?

435
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:46,010
I've done nothing wrong.
No details were divulged.

436
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:51,724
You can't keep it under wraps either.
So it was a preemptive leak.

437
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,269
And it was a glowing piece about you.

438
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:58,314
With Dr. Cha out of commission,
we need to groom a new star doctor.

439
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,650
I'm going to blow my top. Calm down.

440
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:01,776
Three times one is three.
Three times two is six.

441
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,735
Wait, is that correct?

442
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,529
-Three…
-I'm not a specialist yet.

443
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:05,905
Just a first-year resident.

444
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,534
Then why did you perform the procedure?

445
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,788
-You told Dr. Ahn you would take over.
-I wish I could punch your face!

446
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:17,292
What did he do wrong?
They were going to transfer the patient.

447
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,335
Which means the patient could die
during transit.

448
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,171
He can't even hold a scalpel right
but he wanted to save the man.

449
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,548
Let me ask you something.

450
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,467
Have you received training from someone?

451
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,137
No way your MBA program
teaches you how to operate.

452
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,723
You got an MBA? For real?

453
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:34,767
I know grandfather
pulled you out of school

454
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,352
because you were skipping your classes.

455
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,566
You must have learned so much.

456
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,866
The women in our lives…

457
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:52,785
Yes, Mom?

458
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:55,705
Yes, Director Koh.

459
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:57,081
He slammed the door.

460
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,626
That article?

461
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:03,588
It's part of the plan.
We'll build him up as a hero first.

462
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:09,510
Seung-tak, is the article true?

463
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,931
You saved the patient
in that critical moment?

464
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,390
Oh my gosh. It's him.

465
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,684
-That's the doctor.
-I guess so.

466
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,395
Oh my. You're so modest about it.

467
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:23,733
You did the entire operation
and the patient also recovered.

468
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,027
Are you a genius?

469
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,572
I don't think I'm a genius or anything.

470
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,033
Mom,

471
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,285
I'm a little busy.

472
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,412
Can we talk later?

473
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,622
Of course.

474
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,959
When will you be home today?

475
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:44,963
So what's the plan?
Why are you raising his profile?

476
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:48,132
The higher you are, the harder you fall.

477
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:51,970
And that'll cause more damage
when he's the center of attention.

478
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,350
Don't worry.

479
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,477
He'll never

480
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,939
get a seat at the board.

481
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,531
Good morning.

482
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:27,505
Seung-tak is quite a talent.

483
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:30,091
He gets attention wherever he goes.

484
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,093
The administrative director
is so good at his job.

485
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:35,013
Seung-tak was merely helping out,
but he made him into a star.

486
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,056
It's the least he could do.

487
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,810
Besides, Seung-tak is next in line
to be the chair.

488
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,478
I'm so grateful for what he does.

489
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,356
I'm so glad Seung-tak has a cousin
who has his back.

490
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:49,527
Grandfather must be so happy.

491
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:53,031
The hospital is in good hands
with both grandsons working hard.

492
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,127
Seung-tak has a hard life just like me.

493
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,379
Enemies coming from all sides.

494
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,258
What do you want?

495
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,804
Let's go somewhere and talk.

496
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:18,639
We…

497
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:22,101
are not trying to mug you or anything.
Right, guys?

498
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,644
Just come with us quietly.

499
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,438
Go where?

500
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:46,667
Hey, young patient.

501
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,339
What? What are you doing?

502
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,548
I'm playing hide-and-seek.

503
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,718
-Hiding from who?
-From my mom.

504
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:56,844
Go away.

505
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,681
You can't hide like that.

506
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,392
And you shouldn't be
walking around unattended.

507
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,769
You need to go to your room.

508
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,771
Go away.

509
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:16,697
I'd like to hide too.
Just stick my head somewhere.

510
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,786
Hey there, Mr. Hero.

511
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,538
I've got something to ask.

512
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,748
-About yesterday…
-That wasn't me.

513
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,708
What? Then who was it?

514
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,211
Didn't you read the article?
They said it was as if I was possessed.

515
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,295
For real?

516
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,216
It won't happen again so let's just
carry on like we normally do.

517
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,635
How can you be so sure?
It could happen again.

518
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,638
I made a deal with the spirit.

519
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:41,639
Really?

520
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:45,893
Doctor, Seung-jo needs the operation.
Please.

521
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,479
He'll die if he doesn't get it.

522
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:52,400
That's Seung-jo's mother.
We're discharging her son tomorrow.

523
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,360
Why do we have to?

524
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:55,987
We don't have a doctor
who can do the operation.

525
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,739
He just needs an artery conduit
replacement in his right ventricle.

526
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,116
Is that hard?

527
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,742
Yes, it's complicated.

528
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:02,994
It requires CABG.

529
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,080
It's a complicated operation.

530
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,748
And if another doctor
takes on Dr. Cha's patient

531
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,292
and doesn't succeed,

532
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,295
-then it's all on them.
-Doctor, please.

533
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,755
We have nobody else to turn to.

534
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,425
Are all doctors like that?

535
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,926
At times, yes.

536
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,973
She'll have trouble finding a doctor
or hospital that will take her son.

537
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:25,975
Why?

538
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,059
The medical bill.

539
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,730
Our hospital promised to fully cover
the cost of the operation.

540
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,483
Dr. Cha's rich patients
made donations to the hospital.

541
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,985
That was supposed
to cover her medical bill.

542
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,198
I didn't know about this.

543
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,452
It's a special project. Only Dr. Cha
can dip into the donation funds.

544
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,582
Dr. Cha might be an abrasive person,
but there are times he surprises you.

545
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:51,709
-He'll reject people…
-Please.

546
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,669
…who use their influence
to get him to do an operation.

547
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,546
He's such a cool doctor.

548
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:59,342
A special request?

549
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,059
What kind of request do you want?

550
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,228
It's not that difficult.

551
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:13,856
There's a walnut snack
they sell at Yeongdeungpo Station.

552
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,484
Could you buy one bag for me?

553
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,653
Could you get a DVD for me?

554
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:22,323
There's this book I want to read.
Only one library has it.

555
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,701
How could I possibly do those things?

556
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,246
Don't you know?
We're in the same situation.

557
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,206
I knew it.

558
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:34,085
Come on. You have a way to do it, Doctor.

559
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,836
You can enter his body.

560
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:40,675
So you're asking me to possess his body?

561
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:44,887
We're in the same situation?
See? I knew he'd turn us down.

562
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,014
What did you expect?
He's an arrogant prick.

563
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,518
Did you wag your finger at me?
How old are you? You're so disrespectful.

564
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:51,852
-He's…
-Come on. Dr. Cha.

565
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,021
You even saved a life that way yesterday.

566
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,856
So please consider our requests.

567
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,149
Otherwise…

568
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,068
life will be tough around here.

569
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,363
If there's any snack
or dish you want, tell us.

570
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,118
It's not just that patient.

571
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:09,954
All of Dr. Cha's patients
won't be able to get surgery.

572
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,416
We lose one doctor
and the whole department is in crisis.

573
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,259
The tamponade patient is doing well.
He's out of the ICU.

574
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,971
What's the next order?
You want me to take care of it?

575
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,563
Why did Dr. Cha make Sun-ho
his first assistant that day?

576
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:36,856
He should've known better.

577
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,568
I found you.

578
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,487
How did you find me?

579
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,115
-Because I have big eyes.
-That's amazing.

580
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,409
What are we doing next?

581
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:49,577
What do you want to do?

582
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,662
Seung-jo isn't her biological son.

583
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,874
He was adopted when he was a baby.

584
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,335
He had ailments since he was little.

585
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,253
She couldn't afford the medical bills.

586
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,215
Her husband wanted to return the boy
to the orphanage. But she refused.

587
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,802
They got divorced
and she's raising him alone.

588
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,476
Let's play finger wrestling.

589
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:14,518
All right.

590
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,230
Doctor.

591
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,191
Thank you.

592
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:21,609
What?

593
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,069
Yes, sure.

594
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,320
Thank you, Doctor.

595
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:28,991
We found out yesterday
that you operated on my husband.

596
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,496
Thank you so much

597
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,873
for saving his life.

598
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,375
Thank you, Doctor.

599
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,292
Yes, sure.

600
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,462
I'll never forget what you did for us.
I'm so grateful.

601
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,186
So the next order?

602
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,064
Doctor, it's time
for the chest tube squeezing.

603
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,525
The squeezing.

604
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:10,533
So we'll remove the hematoma
from his thoracic chamber?

605
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,763
What? A walnut snack?

606
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,683
He needs a DVD? That jerk.

607
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,393
What kind of request is that?

608
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,190
What is he doing?

609
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:52,158
That imbecile. He doesn't know anything.

610
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,214
Now you're making me
do a squeezing procedure?

611
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:17,057
He can't even do a simple thing like that?
How did he become a doctor?

612
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:24,148
You told me not to enter your body again.
I did as you said.

613
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,525
Where are you going? Seung-tak!

614
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:28,861
I've got something to talk about.

615
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,074
What are you doing in my room?

616
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:36,911
What are you doing?

617
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,207
No, you wouldn't…

618
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,083
Put that back.

619
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,794
I only wore that suit once. It's new!

620
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:48,506
Hey, you.

621
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:52,009
Why take it out on the suit?
Put it back when I'm still being nice.

622
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:52,968
Gently.

623
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,306
You punk! You only have yourself to blame!

624
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:58,891
Okay!

625
00:41:58,974 --> 00:41:59,808
Okay.

626
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:00,935
Take it easy.

627
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,394
Calm down.

628
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:05,481
Seung-tak, I'll do whatever you ask.

629
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:09,151
What will it be? Tell me.
Shall we go do the squeezing together?

630
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,571
No!

631
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:21,205
You told me to do it gently.
I just did as you said.

632
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,002
Are you crazy?

633
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,588
How could you be so petty like this?

634
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,924
-I'll punch you in the throat!
-Revenge is petty.

635
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,884
Did you expect it to be classy then?

636
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:38,514
Dr. Koh.

637
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,275
What is this?

638
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,651
What?

639
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,027
What…

640
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,612
Did someone throw it away?

641
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:01,912
It's my size.

642
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,630
These are all new.

643
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,092
I bought this at the flagship store.

644
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:18,554
Damn it. I charged this on my credit card.

645
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:20,014
In 6-month installments.

646
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:23,892
That bastard.
He's got big dark circles around his eyes.

647
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,787
OUT

648
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,174
This is my office. Why?

649
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,149
Se-jin.

650
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,027
What are you looking for?

651
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,687
I found it.

652
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,526
Must have come from somewhere else.

653
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,103
What's that for?

654
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:16,982
To see your dad's chart?

655
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:20,194
You don't know my password.

656
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,696
Even if you knew,
the device is probably locked out.

657
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:40,464
Now look here. You can't keep coming here.

658
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:42,424
The patient needs his meals.

659
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:47,429
Let go of her!

660
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,350
Okay. Let go of me.

661
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,311
Just take this to him.

662
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:01,193
You're making it difficult for me…

663
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,321
to give a meal to my dad.

664
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,823
We'll take it to him. Just leave it here.

665
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,618
Did he eat all of the marinated crabs
last time?

666
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,495
It's my dad's favorite.

667
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:12,663
Of course, he did.

668
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,790
The chairman finished it all.
He relished it.

669
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,668
All of it?

670
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,130
We'll take this to him.

671
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,758
So don't come here again.

672
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:26,552
You're making our job difficult
by coming here.

673
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,345
Thank you.

674
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:31,056
If he asks for me, let me know.

675
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:32,182
Okay.

676
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:07,092
Sir.

677
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:11,179
I am not trying to suppress news
about your current state.

678
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:14,057
Do you have any savings?

679
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,017
Not a lot.

680
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,269
Do you own a house?

681
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:19,438
-I rent.
-What about your family?

682
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:20,355
Do you have a single mother

683
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:22,232
or lots of brothers
and sisters to support?

684
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,400
No, I'm alone.

685
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,778
I'm sorry for asking that.

686
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:31,033
Do you love my daughter?

687
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,244
You can't answer that question?

688
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,622
Then why are trying to date her?

689
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:39,791
Sir, I think there's a misunderstanding.

690
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,043
If you're

691
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:44,880
interested in her because of
her future inheritance, then give up.

692
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:48,300
She says she won't receive a dime from me.

693
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:49,926
I see.

694
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:54,973
If that's okay with you, then marry her.

695
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,350
What?

696
00:48:57,809 --> 00:48:59,603
Se-jin knows the truth.

697
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,272
I'm allergic to crustaceans.

698
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,441
So how could I eat marinated crabs
and be okay?

699
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,820
I won't ask you to uncover the truth.

700
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:09,946
Instead…

701
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:12,074
I ask you

702
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,951
to prevent her from coming here.

703
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,788
Why add to her burden

704
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,998
when her hands are full
just caring for you?

705
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,334
What right do I have?

706
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:24,419
As her dad,

707
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:27,506
I've only caused her pain.

708
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:33,345
While you're in a coma,

709
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:36,932
she's at your side every day.

710
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,397
Good morning.

711
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,733
And she handles patients
in her spare time.

712
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:49,111
You're not feeling nausea or dizziness?

713
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:52,656
She realized what condition I'm in.

714
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:55,826
Which means she'll do something about it.

715
00:49:56,618 --> 00:50:00,080
If those bastards find out
that she knows then…

716
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,293
You know what I'm saying, right?

717
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:19,558
That doctor is very diligent.

718
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:23,562
He always does a routine check
four times a day.

719
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,323
I knew it.

720
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:39,661
That's keeping me from dying.

721
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:46,001
I don't know whether
to be grateful or angry.

722
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,679
Why add to her burden

723
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,765
when her hands are full
just caring for you?

724
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:01,892
What right do I have?

725
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:14,029
I'm so sorry.

726
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:17,574
Are you okay? Excuse me.

727
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,034
Wait.

728
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:42,599
It's not your fault.
Both the Chairman and I.

729
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:44,684
So don't try too hard.

730
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:52,484
Administrative Director. It's me, Se-jin.

731
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,820
I’d like to discuss
the Chairman's condition with you.

732
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:56,780
Do you have time to talk?

733
00:51:57,864 --> 00:52:01,076
If those bastards find out
that she knows then…

734
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,123
You know what I'm saying, right?

735
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:09,125
No, Se-jin…

736
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:11,253
Your Iced Americano is ready.

737
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:12,963
Just five minutes.

738
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:14,965
Let me borrow your body for five minutes.

739
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:18,468
Hey, Seung-tak.

740
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:19,511
Is that your answer?

741
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:22,013
What will you do
if I enter your body right now?

742
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:22,973
Seung-tak.

743
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,140
Come here.

744
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:26,101
Hey Seung-tak.

745
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:27,936
Hey!

746
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,813
This damn boundary.

747
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,815
Seung-tak, come over here.

748
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:32,941
Let's just talk.

749
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:35,277
You have time to talk, right?
Just a minute.

750
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:40,031
I also needed you for just five minutes.

751
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:40,991
But you ignored me.

752
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:43,451
That was what you wanted?

753
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:47,163
When you raised your hand,
I thought you were telling me to go away.

754
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,999
Let's keep it that way then.

755
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:50,083
This talk is over.

756
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:52,919
I'm sorry. Seung-tak. I'm sorry.

757
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,004
Seung-tak. Just once.

758
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:55,714
I'm begging you.

759
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:57,215
Just for five minutes! Please!

760
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:58,508
Just once, Seung-tak!

761
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,218
If this wasn't here, you'd be dead.

762
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,053
Come back here! Hey Seung-tak!

763
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,525
Why did you call me? I'm busy.

764
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,738
You're acting weird. That's unlike you.

765
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:27,203
Is this about the news article?

766
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,915
I don't care about stuff like that.

767
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,709
But why aren't you asking me?

768
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,921
-Ask you what?
-About the tamponade surgery.

769
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:37,380
You were there.

770
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:39,966
You would've told me if I needed to know.

771
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,051
You'd say it first.

772
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:43,053
To a friend.

773
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,726
The doctors in ER are puzzled.

774
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:51,895
You can't treat a trauma patient properly

775
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:54,397
but it turns out
you're a brilliant surgeon.

776
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:55,357
What about you?

777
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:57,901
Which would you prefer?

778
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,238
Nobody likes a dummy.

779
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:05,116
Especially, when our work
involves saving lives.

780
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:09,746
But I don't like
seeing you getting stressed.

781
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:13,708
Don't overreach.

782
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,752
Don't suffer from cognitive dissonance.

783
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,591
Thanks for the advice.

784
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:26,596
Yes, Brother?

785
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,764
What is it?

786
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,310
He didn't touch his coffee.

787
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,983
You can have it if you want.

788
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:40,735
Thanks.

789
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:42,862
I was a little thirsty. What luck.

790
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:48,868
You two seemed to be having
a good time together.

791
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,745
Before, you were always beating him.

792
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:52,664
Sorry?

793
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,501
It's a habit I picked up in med school.

794
00:54:57,877 --> 00:54:58,795
But why?

795
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:03,133
Did the young doctor do something to you?

796
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,385
Well…

797
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:07,470
He's indebted to me.

798
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:09,097
A big debt.

799
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:19,190
It's just that when I look at him,
I get so bothered and annoyed.

800
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:22,986
Enjoy your coffee.

801
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:24,029
Sure.

802
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:28,283
Well, the young doctor does annoy people
with his attitude.

803
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,910
But he's not a pathetic guy.

804
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:34,831
I'm a good judge of character.
Trust this old lady.

805
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:48,678
She's not that old.

806
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:58,813
What…

807
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:00,440
What is this?

808
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:06,738
Neurology department. Building 37.

809
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:08,573
Code blue.

810
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:13,870
He's so disloyal. What a mean bastard.

811
00:56:17,373 --> 00:56:18,208
A doctor is coming soon.

812
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:20,418
It's a cardiac arrest.
Announce a code blue.

813
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:21,711
Okay.

814
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:29,761
Well…

815
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:32,514
how can I take on a patient like that?

816
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:34,015
Just do things the normal way.

817
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:38,520
Didn't you see it earlier?

818
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:40,188
The spirit left my body.

819
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,607
Don't page me anymore.

820
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:43,691
Okay?

821
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:52,784
Soo-jung says I shouldn't overreach.
I'm a partying type of guy.

822
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:55,245
Did they change the bunk beds?

823
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:00,959
Yesterday, he was a brilliant surgeon.
Today, he's not.

824
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,256
I can't find Seung-jo.

825
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:07,549
What?

826
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:14,264
You scared me.

827
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:17,517
Hey, young patient.

828
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,561
Are you playing hide-and-seek?

829
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:23,314
I told you,
just hiding your head isn't hiding.

830
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:27,068
Your mom won't be able to find you
if you hide here.

831
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:30,113
Get up already. Your mom will be worried.

832
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,077
Doctor.

833
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:41,332
Doctor.

834
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:58,349
-What's wrong?
-He's suffering a cardiac arrest.

835
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:03,188
Administer 1 ml of EPI. Now.

836
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:12,989
Charge.

837
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:19,996
Will I die?

838
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:30,798
Doctor.

839
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:34,010
Will I die?

840
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:36,679
What?

841
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:41,267
Will I die as punishment

842
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:44,687
for what I did to you?

843
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,157
Hey, can you hear me?

844
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,075
Hey.

845
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,168
Mr. Doctor.

846
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:11,631
Can't you save me?

847
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:23,851
It's a V-fib. Get the defibrillator ready.

848
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:24,852
V-FIB: VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION
DE-FIB: DEFIBRILLATOR

849
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:30,567
We're charging.

850
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:32,569
Charge. 200 joules.

851
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:33,528
Everybody, stand back.

852
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,127
Your grandfather
hasn't changed his mind yet?

853
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:51,421
He wouldn't want to
waste a talent like me.

854
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:52,797
Your succession doesn't look easy.

855
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,882
Family feuds are always the bloodiest.

856
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:57,093
I wonder why
I'm clinging onto such a jerk.

857
00:59:57,802 --> 01:00:01,389
I'm a doctor. I'll eventually die
whether or not I enter your body.

858
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:04,183
It's better to be a hidden genius
than a useless moron, isn't it?

859
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,226
But…

860
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:09,105
I'm not going to die like this.
It's infuriating.

861
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:11,816
I can't watch people die.
It's not my style.

862
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,570
-We have a deal?
-Okay.

863
01:00:57,737 --> 01:01:00,114
You can only possess me
when it's necessary and I agree to it.

864
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:01,366
-I'll wave like this.
-I'm not a pet.

865
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:02,867
Ma'am, you can't do that.

866
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:06,663
Are you the quack
who saved that bastard's life?

867
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,831
You broke your promise first.

868
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:11,334
How could you handle the operation
when the other doctors can't?

869
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:12,502
So you open the chest at once.

870
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:15,713
You're walking too close to me.

871
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:17,507
Are you afraid that they'll find out
you can see ghosts?

872
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:20,009
Why aren't you revealing
what you know, Dr. Koh?

873
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,512
Where is he right now?

874
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:24,639
Can you hear me? Seung-tak!

875
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:33,022
