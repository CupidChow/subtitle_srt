1
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,600
Army navy retractor.

2
00:00:58,683 --> 00:00:59,809
Army navy retractor.

3
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,696
What's the matter, Seung-tak?

4
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,539
Hand me another one.

5
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,057
-What's happening to him?
-I wonder why. This never happened before.

6
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,359
Activate the pump.

7
00:01:58,576 --> 00:01:59,786
There.

8
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,621
We've removed the catheter.

9
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:04,874
Now we have to make an incision
in the pulmonary artery.

10
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:13,967
Moving the ventricular catheter
to a different position is the goal.

11
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,636
We have to watch out for the arteries.

12
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,637
What?

13
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,432
That wasn't the original plan.

14
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,561
Doctor, you're capable of handling this.

15
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,610
Right.

16
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,737
I can handle this.

17
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:37,991
Scalpel.

18
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,665
Then let's extend it this much.

19
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,333
A little more to the right.

20
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,503
A little more.

21
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,338
Yes, right there. Good.

22
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,304
Is Dr. Han doing it himself?

23
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,684
Of course, the lead surgeon
should be doing it.

24
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,019
Isn't that so, Administrative Director?

25
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,690
Scissors.

26
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,275
Peanut.

27
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:30,209
We made the incision.
Now we just have to connect the catheter.

28
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,050
Seung-jo. You know me, right?

29
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:44,057
I'll help you meet your mom.

30
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,562
Prolene 6-0 suture.

31
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,942
I haven't operated on a child before.

32
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,738
Hold it. We'll attach the catheter
in this position.

33
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,951
Where's Seung-jo? Did he disappear?

34
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:45,910
Seung-jo.

35
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,870
There he is.

36
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,207
Doctor.

37
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,211
He said he wanted to wash his face
before meeting his mom.

38
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,554
What? You guys couldn't cure him?

39
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,601
The operation was a success.

40
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,061
He should've disappeared.

41
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,563
He should be in his body.

42
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,148
What the heck went wrong?

43
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,941
-This is the first time…
-What?

44
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,485
-What do you mean?
-First time you've looked worried.

45
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,945
You're usually so happy.

46
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,615
We relocated the catheter correctly.
We were careful around the arteries.

47
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,951
None of the arteries were touched.
You saw it, too.

48
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:30,455
His vitals never fell.
What the heck is the problem?

49
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,998
The operation just ended.

50
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,125
It'll take a while
for his mental state to recover.

51
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,337
I'll look after Seung-jo's body.
So look after Seung-jo's spirit.

52
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,173
Don't worry.

53
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:09,202
Seung-tak. Heard the operation went well.
Did we complete the mission?

54
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:12,371
-How is he?
-Blood pressure 110, 70. Pulse is 90.

55
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,373
CVP 6. Everything looks good.

56
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,709
That means the operation was a success.

57
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,503
What? Is there something wrong?

58
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,837
No, nothing.

59
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,048
He'll wake up soon.

60
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,717
But you can't be so sure about that.

61
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,470
Even though it went well,
it's hard to predict

62
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,888
his recovery still.

63
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:32,725
I'm not boasting. I'm being positive.
Trust me. You know my track record.

64
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,352
Sure, I know that.

65
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,063
Stay by his side.

66
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,898
Call me if anything happens.

67
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,358
Okay? Thanks, Brother.

68
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,738
My hand shook. During the operation.

69
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,490
Has that ever happened to you, Tess?

70
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,866
No, it hasn't.

71
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,536
Then why did this happen to me?

72
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:52,870
I don't know either.

73
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,831
It must be Heaven's will.

74
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,208
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

75
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,086
I'm not either. Even if I knew,
I can't tell you.

76
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,754
If I were to say something
and it turns out to be wrong.

77
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,673
I heard that fake news is a crime.

78
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,551
Take a look at this.
The sleeve is short, isn't it?

79
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,010
Should I get this lengthened?

80
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:14,475
Why does he keep going off course?

81
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,937
I thought he was trouble-free.

82
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,522
What?

83
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,775
Could it be because of that?

84
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:30,867
What just happened?

85
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,416
What?

86
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,218
He was picking out his snacks
when he came to get a gift for his mom.

87
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,222
Why is he still around
when his operation was a success?

88
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,142
They don't always disappear right away
after an operation.

89
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,603
There's no standard rule.

90
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,315
How can you say that within earshot?

91
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,566
I know.

92
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,401
Dr. Cha looked very alarmed earlier.

93
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,445
Why are you picking on me?

94
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,594
-How's Seung-jo?
-How is Seung-jo?

95
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:35,515
Seung-jo is in stable condition.
What about his spirit? He's still around?

96
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,600
I shouldn't have operated on him.

97
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,810
I should've stopped.

98
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,273
-What do you mean?
-Dr. Cha!

99
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,196
Doctor.

100
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,377
It's okay.

101
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,212
You're just

102
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,631
about to return to your mom.

103
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,635
Are you coming, too?

104
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,348
Not yet.

105
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:23,312
Be brave when you meet your mom, okay?

106
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,736
You washed your face. Don't cry.

107
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,409
Be reunited with your mom. Have fun.

108
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,744
I'll join you soon.

109
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,081
We'll meet again.

110
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,617
It's my turn. I'm going first.

111
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,245
They cured him.

112
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,622
Together.

113
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,339
Seung-jo.

114
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,298
Seung-jo.

115
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,472
What? Did something happen?

116
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:40,931
Are you awake, Seung-jo?

117
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,391
-Is he awake?
-Not yet.

118
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,189
Seung-jo? Are you awake?

119
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,109
Can you see my fingers?
Do you recognize me?

120
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,031
Seung-tak.

121
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,450
You predicted he would recover.
And you were right.

122
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,494
Of course. I did the operation.

123
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,079
I told you to trust me.

124
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,539
I racked my brain.

125
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,500
No, it was these hands.

126
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,001
These hands pulled it off.

127
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,337
Do you see this? My miracle hands.

128
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,006
You're being very boastful.

129
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,758
I'll go and tell his mom.

130
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,262
Hi Seung-jo.

131
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,972
Welcome back to the real world.

132
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:23,933
Do you know who I am?

133
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:25,810
Seung-jo.

134
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,770
can you

135
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,106
see me?

136
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,777
Seung-jo is only looking at me.

137
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,738
I'm the only one
who can hold your little hands.

138
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:45,913
Does it…

139
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,125
make you happy?

140
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,543
What?

141
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,007
Are you happy that he can only see you?

142
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,903
Have you been drinking lately?

143
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,989
No, I don't drink at all.

144
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,824
Or have you exercised? Strenuously?

145
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,826
No, I don't exercise either.

146
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,828
Do this with your hands.

147
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:28,706
What's this for?

148
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,042
Seung-tak.

149
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,839
You need to take care of your body.
Don't brag about not exercising.

150
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,049
Are you deaf?

151
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,427
I told you a heart surgeon
needs strong stamina.

152
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,889
And those miracle hands
you're so proud of.

153
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,058
To a heart surgeon,
hands are very important.

154
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,936
The life of a patient depends on them.

155
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,063
If your hands slip,

156
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,357
a patient could die
on the operating table.

157
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,361
Did something happen
in the operating unit?

158
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,492
I guess…

159
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,790
It doesn't matter to you.

160
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,627
You don't operate on the patient anyway.

161
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,129
So does it

162
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,297
feel nice?

163
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,968
You wake up and the operation is over.
The patient survives. You like that?

164
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:27,640
You brag about your skills
when someone else did all the work.

165
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:29,850
You're right.

166
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,979
They can only see you.
And only you can touch them.

167
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,732
I'm invisible to them!
I'm in a comatose state.

168
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,651
I can't do anything by myself.

169
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,111
I need to borrow your hands

170
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,489
if I want to

171
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,200
accomplish anything

172
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,540
So…

173
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,876
exercise regularly.

174
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,879
And take a daily dose of magnesium.

175
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,006
Understand?

176
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,508
Do things right.

177
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,403
That's right.

178
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,405
It was about time he got upset.

179
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:29,285
People get very emotional and sad

180
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,580
when they're desperate.

181
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:38,669
You had to set him off
when he was suppressing those emotions.

182
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,213
Why you…

183
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,155
You should sleep in a bed
instead of napping there.

184
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,658
Or you could go out.

185
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,119
Go somewhere and relax.

186
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,331
It's a weekend, after all.

187
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,471
Why don't you listen to me?

188
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,186
How long will you be like this?

189
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,776
Please.

190
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:45,945
Please, Se-jin.

191
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,200
Please, Se-jin.

192
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,620
How much longer?

193
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,873
The patient, Lee Ji-hyun?

194
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,124
I'll be right there.

195
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,399
Get up.

196
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,235
Get up now.

197
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,280
Wake up from your coma. Please!

198
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,659
Please! Wake up!

199
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,411
It's about time.

200
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,748
How long will you stay in a coma?

201
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,502
Please.

202
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,586
That's enough.

203
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,505
I said it's about time.

204
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,298
Get up.

205
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,883
It's about time you got up!

206
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,804
You're being a burden to so many people.

207
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,266
Please get up!

208
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,770
I've had enough.

209
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,157
Yes? What?

210
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,660
The kid's operation was today, wasn't it?
Is it over? How did it go?

211
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:17,870
Did it go well?

212
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,329
It's over.

213
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,664
It was a success.

214
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:21,874
The boy also woke up.

215
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,292
Really?

216
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,546
But you don't sound happy.

217
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,465
Shouldn't you be jumping with joy?

218
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,758
I know, right?

219
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,343
It was a great day up till now.

220
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,471
What? Something happen?

221
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,680
No.

222
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,474
I'm just tired.

223
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,017
But you didn't do much.

224
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,018
It was probably…

225
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,313
all Dr. Cha.

226
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,443
Anyway, that's good news.

227
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,154
Good job, Seung-tak.

228
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,077
That's true.

229
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:00,913
I didn't do much.

230
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,250
Ma'am.

231
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,294
Are you heading home?

232
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,546
Yes. Why are you asking?

233
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,300
The boy just had surgery
and he also woke up.

234
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,551
Isn't that great?

235
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,552
What?

236
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,013
He could've died if you hadn't found him.

237
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,933
It was fortunate
that you found him right away.

238
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,268
You saved the boy's life.

239
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,187
Thank you.

240
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,105
I did?

241
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,607
I don't know what you're talking about.

242
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,694
You told me there was a boy
lying on the floor who needed help.

243
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,948
I think you've got the wrong person.

244
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,367
I have to catch the bus right now.

245
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,868
See you.

246
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,915
You're back.
You show up randomly like always.

247
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,542
You weren't in the room.

248
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,210
I came a while ago,

249
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,837
but you didn't notice me
since you were on the phone.

250
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,840
I came to ask about Dr. Cha's progress.

251
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,466
I guess I got my answer.

252
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,010
It's as you heard.

253
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,970
Dr. Cha's brainwaves have improved.

254
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,849
Why is he still in a coma
when his brainwaves are improving?

255
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:47,019
Doctors don't believe in miracles, right?

256
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,522
You mean Dr. Cha needs a miracle?

257
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,858
Through encounters with people,

258
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,944
I think there could be mysteries
that just can't be explained.

259
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,324
Even if God does 99% of the work
to create a miracle,

260
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:04,786
it's the remaining 1% of willpower
that makes it happen.

261
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,372
Dr. Jang, you're doing your very best.

262
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,291
And Dr. Cha is fighting too.

263
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,297
Sometimes, it feels like this ordeal

264
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,009
is Young-min's way of getting his revenge
against me.

265
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,888
It's like he put up a barrier
to keep me away.

266
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,473
That's ridiculous.

267
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,391
Dr. Cha would be hurt if he heard you.

268
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:30,646
He would break through any barrier
to get to you.

269
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,815
You're completely wrong.

270
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,067
I'm certain of it.

271
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,904
How could you be certain of it, Dr. Koh?

272
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,448
What?

273
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:46,828
You have a habit of talking
like you're inside Dr. Cha.

274
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,374
Cardiology Department
is very busy, isn't it?

275
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:53,043
I appreciate how you care a lot
about Dr. Cha.

276
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:56,255
But don't you think
you visit him too often?

277
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,840
Are you concerned
that I'm not properly caring for him?

278
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,636
If that's not the case,
you should focus on your patients more.

279
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,431
Dr. Cha's patient room
also doubles as my office.

280
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:10,018
So unless you must check on him,
I'd like you to limit your visits.

281
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,104
That also applies to your aide.

282
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,023
Are we clear?

283
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:24,992
What's going on?

284
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,743
Feels like I got punched in the gut.

285
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,663
Did I offend her or something?

286
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,707
Why is everyone building
barriers against me?

287
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,127
Barriers?

288
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:50,851
You met a person who is like
your ex-boyfriend in many ways?

289
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,604
The way he talks, his mannerisms
and sometimes the look in his eye.

290
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:57,774
He also seems to know intimate memories

291
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,651
that only you
and your ex-boyfriend shared?

292
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,238
Am I overreacting?

293
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,575
I've seen cases like these
from time to time.

294
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:10,120
You may subconsciously
project your emotions onto a person

295
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:13,707
who was close to your ex-boyfriend
and was there for you

296
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,792
during a difficult time.

297
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,503
And you end up relying on him
without realizing it.

298
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:24,092
You're also mentally exhausted
after experiencing a personal loss.

299
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,512
You might be reading too much
into his behavior

300
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,639
and interpreting it in your own way.

301
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,268
If that's the case…

302
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:37,272
How about you avoid him for a while?

303
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:41,610
That way, you can reflect on your emotions

304
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,905
and analyze the situation
more objectively.

305
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:25,987
A barrier.

306
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,489
Barrier.

307
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:31,243
What?

308
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:43,380
One day, at the sound of falling leaves

309
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:49,928
I suddenly realized my heart was empty

310
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,475
I miss Seung-jo.
It was nice when he was around.

311
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,769
You said three-hours max.

312
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,062
And that he never listens.

313
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,814
Kids are like that.

314
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,609
When my son was his age, he was worse.

315
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,278
You have a son?

316
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,907
What? I'm not allowed to have a son?

317
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:12,868
Oh, my son, Joon-young.

318
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,412
I wonder how big he has grown.

319
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,972
Gosh. He's rubbing salt into the wound.

320
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,682
Do we have to endure his singing?

321
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:38,810
If only I could hold onto

322
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,479
The time that has flown away

323
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,773
You should file a noise complaint.

324
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,278
He's starting conversations with us now.

325
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,030
Wonder what kind of life he had.

326
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:54,284
I had lived like a fool

327
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:58,121
Does anyone know
what his occupation was before?

328
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,040
What? I don't know.

329
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:01,666
I never asked.

330
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,044
Why are you digging up his past?

331
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,921
I wonder what Tess did for a living.

332
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:13,887
Like a fool

333
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,642
What? What is this?

334
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,811
I can't believe my eyes.
They're cutting costs?

335
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,105
What's the matter?

336
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,944
It must be a mistake, right?

337
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:29,945
CARDIOLOGY FUNDS TEMPORARILY REDUCED

338
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:33,156
I saw that you cut off support
to our doctor's room.

339
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,533
Yes, our hospital finances aren't great.

340
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,452
So I thought we should cut costs.

341
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,287
But it doesn't even cost a lot.

342
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,123
Streamlining every facet of our business
will save us a lot of money.

343
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,708
Are you trying to make a point?

344
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,795
I've got my pride. I hate losing face.

345
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,547
And a few doctors under me
have screwed me over recently.

346
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:52,801
The doctor's room is just the beginning.
You wait and see.

347
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,721
You weren't like this before, cousin.

348
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,474
I stand corrected.

349
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,893
You used to be a sore loser
and get back at people.

350
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:06,564
To hear you bring up old memories
is quite awkward.

351
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,024
Just wait and see.

352
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,527
I'll dial things up a bit.

353
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,570
And make a greater impact.

354
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:16,992
Dr. Cha!

355
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,414
You're scared of him
but you're trying to fight back?

356
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,294
The doctors don't work for you.

357
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,337
Don't prevent them from doing surgeries.

358
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,549
Do you want to know why
Dr. Cha keeps doing surgeries?

359
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,384
You wouldn't get it even if I told you.

360
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:38,013
You play with patients' lives
so how could you understand?

361
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:40,348
Bye.

362
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,892
I haven't used much
of my credit card lately.

363
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,352
My Black card.

364
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,479
I'll cover the costs
for the Cardiology Department.

365
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,201
Yes?

366
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,537
Which floor is it? Which room?

367
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,414
Are you certain?

368
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,124
Mr. Jang is here.

369
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,917
Are you expecting him?

370
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,713
I don't think he's heading to your office.

371
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,089
Then why is he here?

372
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,969
Just leave him alone.
He must be here to see someone else.

373
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,975
What is he doing here?

374
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,647
Hey, Hoon-gil.
Isn't that the late chairman's son?

375
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,149
What is he doing here?

376
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,276
That piece of crap. How dare he come here?

377
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,406
Ninth floor?

378
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:41,826
Who's on the ninth floor?

379
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,668
It's not a bribe.
It's to show my appreciation.

380
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,504
Thanks for finding Seung-jo so quickly.

381
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,756
It wasn't me who found him.

382
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,592
But I did help somewhat.

383
00:27:57,675 --> 00:28:00,095
Could you solve a mystery for me?

384
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,513
You know what a wall is, right?

385
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,306
A wall? What kind of wall?

386
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,350
A cliff? A barrier A concrete wall?

387
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,518
Keep going.

388
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:09,854
Walls that are invisible.
In the realm of medicine.

389
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,440
Inner wall of blood vessels. Outer wall.

390
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,317
Abdominal wall. Chest wall.

391
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,152
What's this for?

392
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,362
What's the mystery?

393
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:20,073
I need a little help
in making a miracle happen.

394
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,367
What are you talking about?

395
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,287
This is lovey-dovey.

396
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,041
You still have time for relationships

397
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,794
while saving dying patients.
I'm impressed.

398
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,422
You stopped in mid-sentence.

399
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:36,881
Explain that a little more.

400
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,384
I feel the urge to punch someone.

401
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,886
Guess this is when you punch a wall.

402
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,054
Wall.

403
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,393
That piece of crap is here.
The late chairman's son.

404
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,855
-He went up to the ninth floor.
-Dr. Jang.

405
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:54,733
Hey, Seung-tak.

406
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,192
What?

407
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,445
Is someone here?

408
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,740
Excuse me.

409
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:02,907
Excuse me.

410
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:05,910
Excuse…

411
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,204
Maybe not.

412
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,082
Dr. Jang?

413
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,388
Young-min, time for lunch.

414
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,982
You used to make sure
I didn't skip my meals.

415
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:41,070
I intentionally skipped meals
so that I could have a meal with you.

416
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,908
I didn't have supper yet.

417
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,576
What? You didn't have supper?

418
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:49,704
How could you
not have anything to eat until now?

419
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,623
Eat the beef.
Stop filling yourself with the broth.

420
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,710
Hey, this stew is so refreshing.

421
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,673
You're sick of this, right?
It's not even that good.

422
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,926
Then hurry up and wake up.

423
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,386
So that we can go
to a nice restaurant together.

424
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:13,853
Hey.

425
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,982
This is where you're living
with your boyfriend?

426
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,150
Why are you here?

427
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,152
What are you doing here?

428
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,115
Dr. Cha.

429
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,244
Get out. Let's talk outside.

430
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,412
We've met before.

431
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,331
I should say hello.

432
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,751
What the hell are you doing here?!

433
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:41,256
Dr. Cha.

434
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,967
What is this? This is your meal?

435
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,472
You have three meals a day?

436
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,932
You're a lucky man.

437
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,308
I told you to get out.

438
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:56,688
So the great Doctor Jang
is spoon-feeding this poor patient.

439
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,524
How come you haven't changed at all
even after 12 years?

440
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:02,777
You're forcing me
to take an interest in Dr. Cha.

441
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,279
He's your Achilles' heel.

442
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:06,865
Look here.

443
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,366
Does he know?

444
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,662
That I used him to blackmail you
into going to America?

445
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,174
Why is her office on the ninth floor?

446
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:33,600
I told you to leave the country

447
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,562
or I'd derail your doctor
boyfriend's medical career.

448
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:41,733
-Did you tell him?
-Don't make me call security. Get out.

449
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,863
Let's see. Which hand was it…

450
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:51,159
Was it his left hand or right hand?

451
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,493
What do you think you're doing?

452
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,383
Who are you?

453
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,677
Not my hand.

454
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,513
Don't! Not my hand. No!

455
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,689
That'll be it for today.

456
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:24,734
Don't make us come again.

457
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,613
Take care of your hand, okay?

458
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:30,990
Doctor.

459
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,423
What should I take this time?

460
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,386
He can't use his hands anyway.

461
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,890
Will you listen if he dies?

462
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,016
I could kill him.

463
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,146
Where are you going?

464
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,982
I haven't finished talking.

465
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,324
Contest inheritance filing form.

466
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,575
I filled it out for you.

467
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,910
It's not going to you.

468
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,746
Name me as the beneficiary.

469
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,001
-What a joke.
-What?

470
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,546
I'm not going to challenge
the chairman's will.

471
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:30,508
Even if I were to receive any money,
I wouldn't give you a penny.

472
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,301
Think about what you did to him.

473
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,845
You're a disgrace to the family.

474
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:36,514
-How dare you. You're out of line.
-Yes, I am.

475
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,684
I'm not afraid of you or anyone else.

476
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:43,229
Talking to trash like you
is a waste of time. So get lost.

477
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,606
Should I call the police

478
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,150
or reporters?

479
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,527
-Give me your hand.
-Let go.

480
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,820
-Your fingerprint!
-Let go!

481
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,947
-Stamp it there!
-Let go!

482
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,032
-Let go of her hand.
-Stamp it!

483
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,117
-Let go!
-Let go.

484
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,285
Let go, you bastard!

485
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,494
Let go!

486
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,538
Please.

487
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,209
Who are you?

488
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,379
This is a family matter
so stay out of this. Stamp it!

489
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,131
-Let go!
-Stamp it now!

490
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,475
Give me your hand.

491
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,268
You bastard!

492
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,479
Can't you hear your father
turning in his grave?

493
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,064
How could he have a son like you?

494
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,566
You'd be dead already
if it weren't for your dad.

495
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:31,569
You made her leave the country?
How dare you! You threatened Se-jin?

496
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:33,738
What kind of person does that?
You bastard!

497
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,198
Are you crazy?

498
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,742
What?

499
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,161
You're dating this guy, too?

500
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,872
You're her other boyfriend?

501
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,128
Dr. Koh!

502
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,965
You punched me?

503
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,759
I'm going to sue you.

504
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,347
What's happening here?

505
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,983
Why did you pull me out of there?
I got assaulted.

506
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,820
Are you on her side now?
You cut a deal with Se-jin?

507
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,780
Who do you take me for?

508
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,783
How could you cause a commotion
at a hospital?

509
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:19,909
What are you doing here?

510
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:22,453
I'm the sole inheritor and only son.

511
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:25,998
I'm not letting her get the inheritance.
She's going to take the money.

512
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:28,543
I'm not going to just watch
as she spends all of it.

513
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,002
Over something like that?

514
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:33,047
"Something like that"?
How can you say that? Do the math.

515
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,632
I'm not doing this only for my sake.

516
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:37,176
Our plan was an utter failure.

517
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,846
Now Dr. Cha has pushed me into a corner.

518
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,432
What do you mean? What about Dr. Cha?

519
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:46,352
You'll call me crazy
if I were to explain it.

520
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,813
Don't come to the hospital anymore, okay?

521
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,659
Mr. Han, you can't treat me like this.

522
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,288
You're forgetting something.

523
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,498
I didn't touch a hair on my dad's head.

524
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,667
All right.

525
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,712
I did cover him with blankets.

526
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:13,880
And patted him down.

527
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:18,509
But you recruited the doctor
and came up with the plan.

528
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,844
You oversaw it.

529
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,430
I didn't orchestrate Dr. Cha's crash.

530
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,018
Now that you remember that,

531
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,437
I need you to cooperate.

532
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,524
We started this together.
So let's see it to the end.

533
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,609
Successfully.

534
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,279
The game isn't over yet.

535
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,873
You don't have my office bugged
or any hidden cameras here, right?

536
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:52,126
-What?
-You came at the right time again.

537
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,628
How did you know though?

538
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,171
Well, that's…

539
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,803
You shouldn't use these hands
for hitting people.

540
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,187
Having able hands is vital to a surgeon.

541
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:22,031
These two drunk men were fighting
in the street.

542
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:25,952
Why don't drunk people just go home
and sleep it off?

543
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,662
They were even swinging sticks.

544
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:35,127
It's true. My hands are okay.

545
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,546
My blood vessels are all right.
No nerve damage.

546
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,798
My muscles are okay, too.

547
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,304
You shouldn't use these hands
for fighting.

548
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,808
For surgeons, their hands are precious.

549
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:54,397
You're the only thing
that's precious to me, Se-jin.

550
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,984
You're more important to me than my hands.

551
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,528
Get serious.

552
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,197
Why do you think hands
are crucial to surgeons?

553
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,574
Patients will depend
on your capable hands.

554
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:08,703
If you don't care about your hands,
then don't become a surgeon.

555
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,830
All right.

556
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,665
Gosh. My hand hurts. Blow on it.

557
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,250
Hurry.

558
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,420
Your hand is all bruised.
It's so upsetting.

559
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:20,089
Don't cry over this little matter.

560
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:22,133
Don't cry. I'm okay.

561
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,386
You promised me.

562
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,513
You'll be a heart surgeon,
I'll be a neurosurgeon.

563
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:30,224
Look at your bruised hands though.
You should be pampering them.

564
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,352
Where's the hand cream I gave you?

565
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,104
Why don't you use the cream?

566
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,109
Come on. Stop crying.

567
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,029
I'm fine. Don't cry.

568
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,914
So you knew the truth back then.

569
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:55,750
Why did you do that?

570
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:57,793
Why on earth?

571
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:17,563
That's a misunderstanding.

572
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:19,065
Really?

573
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:22,193
Then was Dr. Cha
inside your body and not you?

574
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,071
No, he was right next to me.

575
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:27,490
Then was it you when you ran out of ER?

576
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,450
That was me.

577
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,786
So that was you, too.

578
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:35,748
When you hear her name,
you run to her like the wind

579
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,292
and lend her your hand?
And give her a warm smile.

580
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,336
What else will you do for her?

581
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:43,422
Come on. I'm not doing anything for her.

582
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,092
Wait a minute.

583
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:50,930
-Is this you being…
-No.

584
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:51,931
Why would I be jealous?

585
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,557
I was going to say "curious."

586
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:58,396
If you weren't jealous,
why did you peek behind the door?

587
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:03,192
Behave yourself.
You're supposed to focus on the patient.

588
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:05,236
You shouldn't develop feelings
towards a guardian.

589
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,154
Of course, not.

590
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,322
I'll do it properly.

591
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:13,411
What's going on
between Dr. Cha and Dr. Jang?

592
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:15,871
They're in a relationship, right?

593
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:19,625
That's a personal matter.

594
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,087
Then what about you and Dr. Cha?

595
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,589
What? What about us?

596
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,801
You said Dr. Cha can only enter your body.
Nobody else can possess you.

597
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,595
There has to be a reason.

598
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,097
It can't just be a coincidence.

599
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:34,807
You're right.

600
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:36,684
You have a point.

601
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,896
Since we're on the subject,
let me ask you something.

602
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,024
Other people wouldn't believe
this crazy situation but why do you?

603
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,444
I…

604
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,781
witnessed something 20 years ago.

605
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:56,620
You should've told me then.

606
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:59,248
Why did you keep it to yourself?

607
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,585
Why did you leave like that?

608
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:04,962
To a faraway place all alone.

609
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,592
That half-brother of yours.

610
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,386
I should've beaten him to death.

611
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:17,975
I'm sorry.

612
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,479
I shouldn't have left.

613
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,149
It was wrong of me to leave you.

614
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,986
I missed you every day of my life.

615
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,198
I wondered how mad you were at me.

616
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:35,367
I wondered how deep your grudge was.

617
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,205
I wished you'd forget me.

618
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,335
No.

619
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:48,380
I didn't want you to forget me yet.

620
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,471
When we met again,

621
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,850
you looked so sad and bitter.

622
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,815
But it made me feel good.

623
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,235
Even though you were mad…

624
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,405
you hadn't forgotten me.

625
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,200
No, Se-jin.

626
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,744
It must've been hard on you.

627
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,705
You were so mad at me

628
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,500
but you couldn't forget about me.

629
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,760
Why did I say "jealous?"

630
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:36,428
And what? "Behave yourself."

631
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,931
I must have gone mad.

632
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,601
I heard the boy woke up.

633
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,311
Gosh. You frightened me.

634
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,022
Great news.

635
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,607
It's terrific news.

636
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:56,532
Did our little teamwork between you and me
help the boy wake up?

637
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,368
-Sure.
-You know

638
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:03,080
I admire and envy doctors

639
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:05,207
when they save a person's life.

640
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:08,043
I've saved a life, too, right?

641
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,757
It's so rewarding to work at a hospital.

642
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:17,177
I'll clean the floors harder now.

643
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:28,606
I had lived like a fool

644
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,485
What is going on?

645
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:35,946
Does she have a twin?

646
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:42,161
I've been racking my brain.

647
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:44,288
I think you should follow
the natural cycle.

648
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:47,082
His body and your soul should follow
the natural order.

649
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,918
What? What do you mean?

650
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:52,546
Your body is showing signs of improvement.

651
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,966
What could that mean?

652
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:59,261
It means your soul is weakening
while it's roaming outside.

653
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:04,141
And what would happen in that case?

654
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:08,062
Gosh.

655
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,022
Now listen carefully.

656
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:14,276
When you possess another person's body,

657
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,862
you're pushing that soul out of the way.

658
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:21,575
If your possessing power weakens,
what does that mean?

659
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,374
You boys are really slow.

660
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,293
You got pushed out

661
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:34,380
because your possessing power
has weakened.

662
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:45,224
How did you become a doctor
when you're so slow?

663
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,517
Oh gosh.

664
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,937
So I can't do any more surgeries?

665
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,481
You want to continue doing that?

666
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,608
Then keep doing it.

667
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:58,237
If you keep taking risks,

668
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,740
you may ruin the lives of people
who are alive.

669
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:09,039
But you two never listen to me.

670
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:14,002
It's up to you
whether to believe me or not.

671
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:15,587
I've told you…

672
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:18,799
the risks.

673
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,217
Bye.

674
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:37,401
So…

675
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,904
your soul got weaker
as your brainwaves became active.

676
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:43,615
There was a lag while you were in my body.

677
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:47,536
And those moments remain
in my head as echoes?

678
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:49,163
Why didn't you tell me about that?

679
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,748
You didn't give me a chance.

680
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:55,335
Anyway, isn't this a good sign?

681
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,463
It means your brainwaves are improving.

682
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,342
Why am I not waking up
when my brainwaves are getting better?

683
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:06,096
I know that you want
to help more patients.

684
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,516
But for now, let's hold it off.
Stay in your lane.

685
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:13,145
Wait… Yesterday…

686
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:16,106
Let's carefully monitor the situation.

687
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:20,194
You like getting attention?
It's thrilling?

688
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:23,071
You were using my body to do it.

689
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,783
Don’t schedule any operations.

690
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:29,077
How can I do surgery?
You forgot about my hands?

691
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,538
I'm not allowed to operate
if I have cuts like these.

692
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,458
Just because it isn't yours…

693
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,793
That was why, wasn't it?

694
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:39,671
Take this time to rest.
You worked so hard.

695
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,508
I'm not resting. I'm going to work out
and take magnesium pills.

696
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:44,218
I've got a lot of work.

697
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,638
Oh, you! You hold grudges all the time.

698
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,661
Let's be productive.

699
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:34,226
Wall.

700
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,654
Happy hormones.

701
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:46,822
I have happy hormones.

702
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:49,408
Happy hormones.

703
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,396
One Iced Americano with extra ice.

704
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:21,106
I'll also order a latte.

705
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:24,568
I'll have a latte with extra syrup.

706
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:28,071
-I'll have a caramel macchiato. Iced.
-I'll have chamomile tea.

707
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,032
Hot.

708
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,122
You shouldn't skip your meals.

709
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:39,541
Why do you not eat?

710
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:42,002
I can't bring you your meals.

711
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,759
Why don't you smile?

712
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:51,845
I need to see you smile a lot.

713
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:56,725
What a nice room.

714
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:58,393
Lots of sunlight.

715
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,772
What brings you here?

716
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:03,690
Coffee delivery.

717
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:07,361
The young doctor said you needed it.
To get your happy hormones.

718
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,446
It's not for boosting sugar levels.

719
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,407
Hold on.

720
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,533
Wait.

721
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:17,788
We haven't visited him till today.

722
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,873
We've been very inconsiderate.

723
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:22,584
He's in stable condition.
Vitals look good.

724
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:26,463
I appreciate you guys coming here
but it's cramped.

725
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:27,881
As you can see

726
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:29,675
the doctor is working.

727
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:31,259
All right. We'll be on your way.

728
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,637
She can't see or hear us.

729
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:41,645
Bo-mi.

730
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:42,771
Where did Bo-mi go?

731
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:43,939
Bo-mi was…

732
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:47,109
She was right here a second ago.
Where did she go?

733
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:49,111
She disappeared like Seung-jo did.

734
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:55,033
Dr. Jang!

735
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,999
The doctor is here.

736
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,459
Doctor!

737
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,545
I think Bo-mi is going to wake up.

738
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,506
Ma'am.

739
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,091
Are you awake?

740
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,052
-Can you hear me?
-Bo-mi.

741
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:22,394
The patient woke up.

742
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:25,814
Bo-mi.

743
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:27,149
Do you see me?

744
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:31,903
Bo-mi woke up.

745
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,363
She's going to live, Doctor.

746
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,656
Thank you, Doctor.

747
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:36,992
Thank you.

748
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:39,661
Thank you so much.

749
00:50:42,038 --> 00:50:43,039
Thanks.

750
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:46,710
Did the patient wake up?
She's conscious, right?

751
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:49,504
She returned to her body.
Bo-mi entered her body.

752
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,922
Hoon-gil, Bo-mi is back in her body.

753
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:53,759
Yes, indeed. She's back inside.

754
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:57,137
Welcome back to the real world.

755
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,264
Bergson?

756
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:06,730
Does it make you that happy?
You haven't woken up.

757
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:10,317
It's nice to have one of us live.
Better than all of us dying.

758
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:14,029
Do you have to say that?

759
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:15,739
Be nice.

760
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,365
He's sensitive lately.

761
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,577
Let's go. It's time.

762
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:25,624
He's pretending to be all right.

763
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:29,711
Why didn't he tell her his feelings
while she was still around?

764
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:32,339
Wait for me.

765
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:37,886
She's improving.

766
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,777
They come here at least three times a day.

767
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:57,072
Even if they were
in the middle of something.

768
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,826
During the morning rounds
and visiting hours.

769
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,369
Nothing happens most of the time.

770
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,246
When I came to the hospital as a kid,

771
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,872
I'd always come here first.

772
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:08,750
Because I could check
if I could still see ghosts.

773
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,547
Sometimes, there would only be one ghost.

774
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:15,715
Some days, there would be two.

775
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:18,718
They would sit over there.

776
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,638
Whenever I'd come to the hospital,
I'd make a wish.

777
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,975
I wished I couldn't see ghosts anymore.

778
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:29,479
But if I didn't see any ghosts,
I'd get curious.

779
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:33,149
I'd wonder what happened to them.

780
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,193
It's either one of two things.

781
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:36,611
Either they woke up

782
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,029
or they died.

783
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:39,614
I didn't know it back then.

784
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:42,367
But I realized as I got older.

785
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:45,370
As new patients come in daily,

786
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,623
the existing patients
would be less cared for.

787
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:51,501
Despite that,

788
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:55,881
the ghosts would cling
to a thread of hope like them.

789
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:58,425
Three people.

790
00:52:58,967 --> 00:52:59,801
Five people.

791
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:01,803
Nine people.

792
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,224
The people I saw.

793
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:08,226
Their families

794
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:10,770
you saw.

795
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:16,192
The people who loved them,
who smiled or cried

796
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:18,945
when those ghosts vanished.

797
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:24,409
While you were running away
from ghosts in fear,

798
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:27,037
I was running away from
those people out of fear.

799
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:33,293
I wondered if my urge to save the patient
was lesser than theirs.

800
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:35,545
Could I

801
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:37,714
save the patient?

802
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:40,425
What if I couldn't?

803
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:46,473
Those patients probably want to talk
to their loved ones.

804
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:51,394
What if they'll never
get that chance because of me?

805
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:07,035
I was always stricken with fear.

806
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:13,083
Due to the fact that not only
did I have their life in my hands

807
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,501
but also their entire future.

808
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:22,801
Let's go in.

809
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,273
My vitals are good.

810
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:41,361
And I got my hair washed.
I have a fresh change of clothes.

811
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:45,824
My urine tube looks clear.

812
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:49,577
The nurse changed my position well.

813
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,204
Did they change my diaper?

814
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:54,290
Yes, they did.

815
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:57,168
Thank you nurses for your dedication.

816
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,505
They can't hear you.

817
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:03,800
What? We should come
and greet them after we wake up.

818
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:04,968
Right.

819
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:20,692
Who put that here?

820
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,487
Who put the C-line in?

821
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:27,741
The patient had a fever due to UTI.

822
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:30,869
We had to use antibiotics,
but his previous line was an old one.

823
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:32,996
A new one was inserted yesterday.

824
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:34,789
That intern did it.

825
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,211
Is he crazy?

826
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:42,213
Who lets the intern insert a C-line?

827
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:45,300
What is it? Do you see a problem?

828
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,305
What are you doing?

829
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:52,348
Can't you see?
I'm looking at the patient's chart.

830
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,477
You told me not to give up on them.

831
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,437
You said it was the duty of a doctor

832
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,440
to keep searching for a cure
until the very end.

833
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:01,691
You told me that.

834
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:05,653
I need you to follow up on the patient
and report back to me.

835
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:07,238
Go take care of your work.

836
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,748
He's changing his ways too quickly.

837
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:21,169
I'm glad you're here.
I was about to page you.

838
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:22,420
What is it?

839
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:25,006
I came alone. I can't see any patients.

840
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,300
-You're the patient.
-What?

841
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:31,221
It's too early for that.

842
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:32,430
No, it isn't.

843
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,143
So you didn't like my bandages?

844
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,853
You wanted to give me yours?

845
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,688
All right. That hurt.

846
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:42,899
I might not be good at a lot of things,
but I'm good at this.

847
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,944
You're an expert at dressing a wound.

848
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:53,952
-Let's do a CT scan first.
-Okay.

849
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:40,123
What? What's wrong with this patient?

850
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:41,499
Nurse Jung!

851
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:43,751
Pneumothorax.

852
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:46,129
A CONDITION WHERE AIR AND GAS
BUILD UP IN THE CHEST CAVITY

853
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:52,927
By the way, did you solve that mystery?

854
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:55,346
What? Not yet.

855
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:57,849
You said it was related to medicine.

856
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,309
There's a question
you don't know the answer to?

857
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:00,727
I know.

858
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,062
I'm not sure if an answer even exists.

859
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,733
Young doctor. There you are!

860
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:09,027
Sorry about this,
but this is an emergency.

861
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:12,489
What do you call that?
Code Blue! Hoon-gil.

862
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:14,824
Darn it.

863
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:17,911
Where are you going?

864
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:24,000
Is a doctor coming?

865
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:26,544
All the residents
are in surgery right now.

866
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:27,712
What? No one is available?

867
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:29,464
What about Dr. Koh?

868
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:32,592
Code Blue.

869
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:34,928
Why isn't he here yet?

870
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:38,890
Am I going to die?

871
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:41,518
I'm going to die, right?

872
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:47,398
I'm dying, right?

873
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:51,319
Hold on. I'll do it.

874
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,125
What's the matter? How is the patient?

875
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:09,420
Hoon-gil.

876
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:13,007
His blood oxygen levels are rising.
His pulse stabilized.

877
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:34,737
What's going on?

878
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:24,579
But if I didn't see any ghosts,
I'd get curious.

879
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:27,248
I'd wonder what happened to them.

880
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:29,876
It's either one of two things.

881
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,128
Either they woke up

882
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:33,463
or died.

883
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:45,975
What is it now?

884
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:48,686
I asked you to limit your visits here.

885
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,355
How long did it take

886
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:53,775
for that happy hormone patient to wake up?

887
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:56,611
When you were talking to the doctor
in America,

888
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:58,863
I didn't hear what he said.

889
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:02,450
Did you see me?

890
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:04,827
Yes, that was me.

891
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,245
It worked, didn't it?

892
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:12,210
Hoon-gil was turning pale,
so I used a technique

893
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:17,215
I learned from watching the doctors.

894
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:21,010
When you hang out at a hospital as I do,
you pick up a few tricks.

895
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:26,474
I'm a doctor.

896
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:29,727
I can tell whether or not you picked up
a technique by just observing.

897
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:33,481
Hey, I've been here for 20 years.

898
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:37,860
When you've been around as long as I,
you can do CPR and even suture a wound.

899
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:43,366
You told me you don't interfere
in the lives of the living.

900
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:46,077
Wait a minute. Is he alive?

901
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:49,080
Don't mind him. Worry about yourself.

902
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:52,458
The news about your brainwave activity
has gotten to your head.

903
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,293
-What?
-Why do you think

904
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:56,462
what happened to him

905
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:59,882
could never happen to you?

906
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:02,176
Gosh.

907
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:22,238
Why did you call me?

908
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:25,366
I thought you would never call me again.

909
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:32,999
Dr. Ahn, now don't be like that.

910
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:37,044
You thought it would be over
if you just left the hospital?

911
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:40,173
Dr. Cha is still alive.

912
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:46,387
Did all of those patients

913
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:49,766
who had happy hormones wake up?

914
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:52,935
Well…

915
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:55,313
You're a doctor, right?

916
01:02:55,396 --> 01:02:57,064
You would know.

917
01:02:57,148 --> 01:03:02,028
Healthy patients
will sometimes die overnight.

918
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:03,571
What?

919
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,199
Medical advice?

920
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,575
It's not a big matter.

921
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:10,995
There was a minor incident
at the hospital today.

922
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:16,292
It provided me with useful insight.

923
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:18,461
There was a coma patient

924
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:23,174
who had a good prognosis,

925
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,635
but somehow,

926
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,388
he died suddenly.

927
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:41,359
That was Dr. Cha.

928
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:46,113
What are you talking about?

929
01:03:46,697 --> 01:03:47,740
You heard that right.

930
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:52,745
The behavior I displayed
that confused you wasn't me.

931
01:03:58,209 --> 01:04:01,212
It was actually Dr. Cha.

932
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:07,426
Seung-tak.

933
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:11,556
Are you crazy?

934
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:13,099
What do you think you're doing?

935
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:15,017
I'm telling the truth.

936
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:17,019
This time.

937
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:19,605
I am…

938
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:22,567
No.

939
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:24,902
Revealing the truth about us.

940
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:26,571
Hey, Seung-tak.

941
01:05:20,374 --> 01:05:22,543
You want to tell her how you feel,
don't you?

942
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:25,880
I'm not going to lose him again.
That's why I'm trying harder.

943
01:05:25,963 --> 01:05:27,548
-I found something.
-What?

944
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:28,799
About the barrier.

945
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:31,344
I found the cause
of Dr. Cha's weakening consciousness.

946
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:33,429
You mean Dr. Cha can wake up
from his coma?

947
01:05:33,512 --> 01:05:34,430
Why you!

948
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:36,515
How can we proceed with surgeries
in this situation?

949
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:40,227
Is there a doctor who wants to cure you
more than you do?

950
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:42,229
What if my hand shakes
in the operating unit?

951
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:43,648
Don't forget to say goodbye.

952
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:45,524
Seung-tak!

953
01:05:50,154 --> 01:05:55,159
