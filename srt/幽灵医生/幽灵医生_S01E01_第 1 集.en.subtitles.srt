1
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:40,540
Dad.

2
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:43,042
-Are you okay, Dad?
-The other hospitals can't take him!

3
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,671
Please help us out here.
We don't have anywhere else to call.

4
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,759
No. This can't be happening.

5
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:54,596
Dad.

6
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:59,601
In life, some moments come at you fast.

7
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:04,731
Dad.

8
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,400
Dad.

9
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,531
And you search for god in those moments.

10
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,328
Damn it.

11
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,249
This is the patient
whose aortic aneurysm has ruptured.

12
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,919
I told you we don't have
any doctors available for surgery.

13
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:28,546
How could you bring him here
when I told you that?

14
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,216
His vitals are barely steady.
He's in hypovolemic shock.

15
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,218
He'll die if he
doesn't get surgery right now.

16
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,469
We can't operate on him.

17
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:35,637
Hurry up and leave.

18
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,596
Now.

19
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,140
-Dr. Ha.
-Yes?

20
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,058
Show them out.

21
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,310
-Okay. Let's go now.
-Doctor.

22
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,230
Please save my dad's life.

23
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,440
Please.

24
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:50,902
Get them to leave.

25
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,365
And if god is too busy
to hear your prayers,

26
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:59,661
you'll wish a demon could come and help.

27
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,287
-Let's go!
-No!

28
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,539
You can't do that!

29
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,588
Please reconsider.

30
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,215
If you reject this patient,

31
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,259
he could die
on his way to another hospital.

32
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:15,760
What do you think you're doing?

33
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,345
You're just an intern.

34
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:20,181
-Hurry up and get them out of here!
-No.

35
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:22,851
Stop!

36
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,483
This is a hospital and we're doctors.

37
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,402
If we give up on our patients,
who will treat them?

38
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,612
So you think you're a doctor, too?

39
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:38,992
Will you operate on this patient yourself?

40
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,633
No, Dad!

41
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,987
So what happened?

42
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,573
Did the demon save the patient's life?

43
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,159
You're curious, aren't you? Well…

44
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,037
It's a secret.

45
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,706
There will be trouble if people find out.

46
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,667
Are demons real though?

47
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:30,752
Of course.

48
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,420
There's probably one in this hospital too.

49
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,506
A guardian spirit
that looks after sick people.

50
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,674
You've heard of guardian spirits, right?

51
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:42,555
So be thankful for the spirit doctors
who are watching over you.

52
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,890
You need to believe that.

53
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,851
-"Thank you."
-You're lying!

54
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,520
There are no nice demons or spirits.

55
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,899
That's right. You're lying.

56
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,776
How can a doctor be a spirit anyway?

57
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,486
Are they a superhero or what?

58
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,112
She's telling us lies!

59
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:01,199
-You're a liar, lady!
-Gosh, kids these days…

60
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,660
They don't listen to their elders anymore.

61
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,419
It's a lie that a living person…

62
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,047
12 YEARS LATER

63
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,590
…can cure everyone.

64
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:19,926
That's a lie, indeed.

65
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,144
EUNSANG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

66
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,447
He's impeccably dressed as usual.

67
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,660
That's Dr. Cha Young-min, a heart surgeon.

68
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,662
What? He's a doctor?

69
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:48,955
You didn't expect that, did you?

70
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,792
Why would someone so handsome
become a doctor?

71
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:57,463
And he's also shrouded in mystery.

72
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:58,923
What is it?

73
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,594
What's the CPR time?

74
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,975
911 RESCUE

75
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,314
It took us 30 minutes to get here.
There were no witnesses.

76
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,482
-So we don't know when it happened.
-This way.

77
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,582
Send Dr. Han. There's no need for an ECMO.

78
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,797
Move it.

79
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,971
-All right. Three, two, one.
-Three, two, one.

80
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,222
I'll check for a pulse.

81
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,685
I'll intubate him.

82
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,356
Give me a 7.5 mm.

83
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,359
Let me do it.

84
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,739
Pump the Ambu bag.

85
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,911
Defibrillator.

86
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,497
Cardiovascular department?
Why isn't the ECMO here?

87
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,165
They said they'd be here.

88
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,502
200 joules. Charge. Move away.

89
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,128
The charge is ready.

90
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,007
Let me check his heart rhythm.

91
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,593
Keep up the compression.

92
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,470
Check his pulse.

93
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:28,888
Where's she going?

94
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,348
Hey, Soo-jung!

95
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,104
Dr. Cha Young-min!

96
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:46,531
There's a patient in ER who needs ECPR.
Could you please see the patient?

97
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,785
An intern? Ms. Oh?

98
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,538
I'll introduce myself later.
Could you please come now?

99
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:57,083
It's so typical of you interns
to not know your place.

100
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,876
It's fine. I was like that, too.

101
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,380
-It's a privilege that interns have.
-Doctor. Watch out.

102
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,760
I'm sorry, Doctor. But we don't have time.

103
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,679
Please hurry.

104
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,306
What is the meaning of this?

105
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,774
Listen up, Intern.
I don't have a lot of time.

106
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,444
First, I don’t just see any patient. Why?

107
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,154
Because other doctors
will make time to see them.

108
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:29,240
Second, I don't see
emergency patients. Why?

109
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,159
Because I screen patients
before I accept them.

110
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,578
Third, I don't see patients like that.
Which kind?

111
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,705
Someone like that patient
who just came in.

112
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,752
These hands are for patients
who have at least a 1% chance of survival.

113
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,463
Doctor, watch out.

114
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,969
-If you have time to talk--
-Yes, you were saying?

115
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,434
Ms. Oh, just go back to ER.

116
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,936
Learn how to give the TOD.

117
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,149
I must go now and save a life.

118
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,034
What a jerk.

119
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,224
What's his name?

120
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,310
Well…

121
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,520
His name?

122
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:45,024
It's Shin Jung-woo.

123
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,655
Shin Jung-woo.

124
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,533
The time of death is 9:31 am…

125
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,411
September 2nd.

126
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,763
Cha Young-min, you jerk.

127
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,224
Who?

128
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,768
Did you actually go and talk to him?

129
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,271
Hey, do you know who he is?

130
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:24,689
It doesn't matter.

131
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,941
He's a punk and a despicable doctor.

132
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,109
A punk?

133
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,735
You're going to be in trouble.

134
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,905
Even the hospital director treats him
with utter respect.

135
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,991
He's the top surgeon at this hospital.

136
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:35,908
EUNSANG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

137
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,374
When he was just an intern,

138
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:47,044
he single-handedly operated
on an emergency patient and saved him.

139
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:51,549
It sent a shockwave through the hospital.

140
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,718
He did that again several times
after he joined the faculty.

141
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,596
He's saved the lives of every patient
he operated on.

142
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:00,391
There's even a rumor
that he's possessed by a spirit.

143
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,562
What did you just say?

144
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,315
The operation he did as an intern?

145
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,109
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

146
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,611
I mean, he was your age at the time.

147
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,696
No matter how smart you are--

148
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,864
Not that part.

149
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,782
The rumor about him being possessed.

150
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,035
It's just a metaphor.

151
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,245
Because he's so good at what he does.

152
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,248
There's no way he's actually possessed.

153
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,463
33-year-old female patient
with Behcet's disease.

154
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,714
A Bentall procedure
was performed due to AR.

155
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:32,965
Suffered inflammation
that required three operations.

156
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,968
Dr. Cha will perform
a Quadrido-Bentall procedure today

157
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,179
to treat her aortic aneurysm.

158
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,142
Quadrido?

159
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,935
Is this the patient's fourth surgery?
Not her fifth one?

160
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,981
Well, technically, it's her fifth surgery.

161
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,359
You could call it a follow-up surgery
in this case.

162
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,446
Dr. Cha, as you're well aware.

163
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,449
It's a recurring disease
that requires successive operations.

164
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,868
It'll manifest as coalescence
and fuse randomly.

165
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,912
Sometimes it'll burst
when you cut open the chest.

166
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,413
That makes it a very delicate
and complex operation.

167
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:09,210
Why did you take on such a delicate
and complex operation?

168
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:10,711
Well, that's because…

169
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,172
The other doctors refused
to operate on the patient.

170
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,466
Why don't you do
the follow-up operation yourself?

171
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,847
-You see, Doctor…
-What?

172
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,349
The patient doesn't trust Dr. Ban…

173
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,019
He strongly requested a different surgeon.

174
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,898
Guess I'll have to do it.
Get the patient ready. Next.

175
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,365
A male patient in his seventies.

176
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,825
Suffers from chronic diabetes
and high blood pressure.

177
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,660
Also had a stroke two years ago.

178
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,745
He was short of breath a month ago

179
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,331
and was diagnosed with
cardiac sarcoma after his examination.

180
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,084
I was assigned the patient.

181
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,670
The patient's son asked
if I could operate--

182
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,255
So, will you?

183
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,299
No, of course not.

184
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,676
How could I do it?

185
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,970
I'm wondering if you could
operate on him, Dr. Cha.

186
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,388
No, I can't do it.

187
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,181
Now Dr. Cha…

188
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:08,644
You shouldn't be so quick to judge.
I mean, consider how his son feels.

189
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:20,030
A blood clot or a piece of the tumor
could travel to his brain

190
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,907
and cause a stroke.
That’s a high possibility.

191
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:25,411
We can't remove the entire tumor,
so there's a high chance it'll grow back.

192
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,621
Without surgery,
the patient can live for a year.

193
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:31,834
Tell the son that if he doesn't want to
shorten his dad's life,

194
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:35,880
he should let his dad
die peacefully at home.

195
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,549
Now look, Dr. Cha. Why don't you--

196
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:39,592
Next.

197
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,978
He's doing that on purpose
to embarrass me.

198
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,689
I'm a senior faculty, but he doesn't care.

199
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:57,318
He thinks he's all that
because he's a skilled surgeon.

200
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:00,738
Let him keep thinking like that.
One of these days…

201
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,781
I'm counting on it.

202
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,617
I almost forgot.

203
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,618
Today's the day.

204
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,495
We'll see, you punk.

205
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,872
You're going to meet your match.

206
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,751
Go and have a great day.

207
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,799
He doesn't say a word in the meeting,
but he always rants afterward.

208
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,594
What did he mean by that?

209
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,596
About Dr. Cha meeting his match.

210
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,057
Okay. The meeting is over.

211
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,266
Pull the plug.

212
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,686
Let's see…

213
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,439
Why is he in such a good mood?

214
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,607
It's like he has a screw loose.

215
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,317
We're getting new interns today.

216
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,945
He had it tough for two years
being the youngest.

217
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,821
He's happy to finally
have interns under him.

218
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:44,990
Was that today?

219
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,202
But the Medical Residents Act
has made life easier.

220
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:51,121
So where are these interns?
This is their first day.

221
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,998
-Put them to work when they're here.
-Okay, Doctor.

222
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,377
Dr. Ahn, what's that sour expression for?

223
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,711
What is it?

224
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,838
Are you in a bad mood because
you announced the TOD this morning?

225
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,216
No, Doctor.

226
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,051
How did you know though?

227
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,135
I was passing by.

228
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,346
The patient had
an unwitnessed arrest, right?

229
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,473
It took 30 minutes to get here
and CPR didn’t work.

230
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:10,516
It was obvious.

231
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,489
What about the ECMO?

232
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,991
-We didn't get it
-Good call.

233
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,410
It costs three million
just to prime the ECMO.

234
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,870
You have to discard the fluids
if you don't use the machine.

235
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,872
It would have been a waste
if we didn't use it.

236
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,374
Good job.

237
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:51,515
You must be Dr. Cha Young-min.
I've heard a lot about you.

238
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,058
You're the top surgeon here.

239
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,853
Yes, that's true. But who are you?

240
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,563
What?

241
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:01,191
So this is the hand
of the famous star surgeon.

242
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,194
You have such soft hands.

243
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,946
I take care of them very well.

244
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,325
But who are you?

245
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,369
There was a chairman who once said,

246
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,580
"One genius can support
the livelihoods of 100,000 workers."

247
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,457
Let me see.

248
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,626
Our medical center
has 2,000 health professionals

249
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,127
and 5,800 regular employees.

250
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,378
That's about 8000 people.

251
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,882
You could support the payroll
of ten hospitals.

252
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,009
-Excuse me.
-It costs three million for an ECMO.

253
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,427
That's one month's salary
for an average worker.

254
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,889
If you can stop ten unnecessary
ECMO activations, that'll save a lot.

255
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,099
What's your business?

256
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,227
-Who are you?
-You have a great reputation

257
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:40,606
but I also heard
that you're not a people person.

258
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:41,565
Hey, look here.

259
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,276
Geniuses have special privileges.
It's also what makes them quirky.

260
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,028
It was Aristotle who said,

261
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,614
"No great mind has ever existed
without a touch of madness."

262
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:51,325
It takes an entire hospital
to hold onto a genius.

263
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,579
If you ever come upon any obstacles

264
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:59,124
while performing dazzling surgery,
you can come and talk to me.

265
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,101
You're busy people, so I'll let you go.

266
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,021
-What?
-Where's the locker room?

267
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,648
That way.

268
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,239
By the way…

269
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,411
I'll be joining your department
as a new resident.

270
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,454
My name is Koh Seung-tak.

271
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:39,707
Nice to meet you all.

272
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,008
Please wait up.

273
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,513
Is he one of our new interns?

274
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,726
Hey, who is he?

275
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:02,521
Hey, who was that punk?

276
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,384
You know him, don't you?

277
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,261
Since when?

278
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,763
Where did you meet him?

279
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,015
-How much do you know?
-Since medical school.

280
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,100
Just as classmates.
I don't know him that well.

281
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,101
Only a little.

282
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,478
"Nice to meet you all"?

283
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,981
-Did you tell him to say that?
-No. I wouldn't dare to…

284
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,067
I only shared some information with him.

285
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:50,569
Information?

286
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,280
What kind of information?
That I have a touch of madness?

287
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,656
You got it all wrong.

288
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,867
I'm a victim actually.

289
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,868
Koh Seung-tak?

290
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,538
Is he the guy who said,
"Because my parents made me?"

291
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,706
You know him, too?

292
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,751
I heard a rumor.

293
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,338
His internship interview was famous.

294
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:14,134
You know the typical answers
that everyone says?

295
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,053
Why did you become a doctor?

296
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,388
I want to heal patients who are suffering.

297
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,557
I'd like to save lives.

298
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,936
Those are the common answers you hear.

299
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:24,895
But one person said this.

300
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,271
Because my grandpa made me.

301
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,440
My mom made me.

302
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:33,112
His grandfather
is our foundation's chairman?

303
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,447
And his mother is
the chairman of the board?

304
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,448
APPROVED

305
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:41,495
How could he get residency
through connections in this day and age?

306
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,625
What now?

307
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,753
What if the other doctors
mount a protest over this?

308
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:53,173
Please reconsider this decision.
This is unheard of.

309
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,300
He graduated summa cum laude
and received top marks in his internship.

310
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,469
If this seems unfair,
then the same applies to you.

311
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,680
The doctors probably agreed to
give him the top marks.

312
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,641
Since when did we pick residents
based on grades in med school?

313
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,309
It's about character,
duty, and dedication.

314
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:08,188
Since when did you care about such things?

315
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,692
Assign him to a different doctor then.
I'm not fond of his character.

316
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,153
He's a bit immature, isn't he?

317
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,530
Good morning, Mr. Han.

318
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,367
You're his cousin
so you must know him well.

319
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,995
He's not just immature.

320
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,831
He's rude, disrespectful,
and devoid of people skills.

321
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,208
He's lacking in many respects.

322
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,294
So I'm hoping you'll
guide him well, Dr. Cha.

323
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:35,299
You could say the future of the hospital
is in your hands.

324
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,926
Didn't I tell you?

325
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,554
Dr. Koh is the successor
to our foundation.

326
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,348
But the chairman set a few conditions
he has to meet first.

327
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,392
He has to prove himself.

328
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:56,612
So he needs my stamp of approval
to become the chairman?

329
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,658
How did it go?

330
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,495
Are you seriously asking me that?

331
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,747
What do you think?

332
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,708
I can't tolerate a punk like him
wearing a doctor's coat.

333
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:34,900
This scent…

334
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,281
What kind of a doctor
wears perfume at a hospital?

335
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,534
It's not meant to be used here.

336
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,704
It's for masking the hospital smell
when they go on a date after work.

337
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:48,789
Heard of work-life balance?

338
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:54,378
If you're done splurging on gifts,
why don't you get to work, Dr. Koh?

339
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,843
Come on. It's time for our morning rounds.

340
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,440
A 65-year-old female patient. Bicuspid ES.

341
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:19,278
Ascending aorta dilatation. AVR.
Ascending aorta replacement in progress.

342
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,445
Day one of postoperative day.

343
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,073
Extubation at ten last night.
No signs of complications.

344
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,116
Seung-tak.

345
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,160
Explain a bicuspid aortic valve.

346
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,666
It's a congenital heart defect

347
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:36,128
where an aortic valve
only has two leaflets, instead of three.

348
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:39,089
Within the aortic valve fusion type,
various hemodynamic pictures emerge.

349
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,300
In young patients, it will show as AR.

350
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:45,595
In older patients, it'll be AS.
Sometimes, there'll be aorta dilatations.

351
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,598
He had quite a reputation in med school.

352
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,142
For what?

353
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,852
He knows the material
as well as the professors.

354
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,314
That doesn't prove anything.

355
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,983
He aced every test he took.

356
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,485
He read obscure research papers

357
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,697
and would ask difficult questions
that would stump the professors.

358
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,449
Because of him,

359
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:08,160
some professors had to prepare
extra hard before a class.

360
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,163
You took a year off from school.
You must've kept studying.

361
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,499
Seung-tak, you're assigned
to this patient.

362
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,917
What?

363
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,215
Seung-tak.

364
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,383
What is a maze OP?

365
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,474
The maze procedure

366
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,226
includes the creation
of lines of conduction blocks

367
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,145
that block the abnormal impulses
that cause atrial fibrillation,

368
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:38,190
enabling restoration
of normal sinus rhythm.

369
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:40,859
He's your patient, too.

370
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:44,738
But Doctor….

371
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:48,116
This patient is still unstable.

372
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,576
-I should…
-Dr. Ahn.

373
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,995
Does a doctor only see stable patients?

374
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,331
Let him.

375
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,592
Seung-tak.

376
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,052
What antibodies do you use

377
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,346
for culture-negative
infective endocarditis?

378
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,350
I don't know.

379
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,478
You don't?

380
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,067
We should administer antibiotic medication

381
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,611
such as vancomycin,
gentamicin, ampicillin,

382
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:27,030
ceftriaxone, or cefepime
depending on the situation.

383
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,574
Talk to the Infectious Disease Department
and proceed.

384
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,787
Me?

385
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:36,581
Yes. Seung-tak says he doesn't know.

386
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,506
Why me?

387
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,716
Because we're brothers.

388
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,221
What about the rest of them?

389
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,150
Those patients are…

390
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,155
Jae-won.

391
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,781
Why are those patients still here?

392
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,326
Well, their families are refusing
to have them moved.

393
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,662
We don't have enough beds.

394
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,123
Have them moved by this week.

395
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,000
-Okay.
-I see.

396
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,544
So a wise and proper doctor

397
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,505
gives up on his patients like them.

398
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,259
I learned a huge lesson on my first day.

399
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:38,935
Seung-tak.

400
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,188
There are two types of patients here.

401
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,148
Patients that were saved with these hands

402
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,275
and patients that can't be healed
even after I tried.

403
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:48,445
And if I can't fix a patient
that I operated on, then nobody can.

404
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,363
They are such patients.

405
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,157
You mentioned supporting
the livelihoods of the staff.

406
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,410
A high inflow of patients
will result in higher profits.

407
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:56,328
That's a given.

408
00:24:56,411 --> 00:25:01,291
Why stick with terminal patients
at the expense of other patients?

409
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,461
I wonder why they're
holding on so desperately

410
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:07,297
as if they have
a great life ahead of them?

411
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,677
One should know to let go when it's time.

412
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,304
Don't you agree?

413
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,519
You're so arrogant.

414
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,527
Don't you think so? He's so conceited.

415
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,530
It's typical of doctors. They're arrogant.

416
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,324
More so with him, since he's a genius.

417
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,994
Most geniuses
have a little madness in them.

418
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,248
So ignore what he said.

419
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,708
Don't dwell on it.

420
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,546
EUNSANG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

421
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,008
Are you eating well?

422
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,093
I ate a little.

423
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,376
What is it now?

424
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,627
Your grandpa made you go to med school.

425
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:28,712
Then he told you to become an intern.

426
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,755
What does he want from you now?

427
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,883
The chairman needs to tighten security.

428
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,553
How come an intern like you knows that?

429
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,849
He gave me another task.
I have to win over the board.

430
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,435
Really? Must've come as a surprise.

431
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,646
It's my destiny as his successor.
I have to perform difficult tasks.

432
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,481
I'll be fine as long as I do okay.

433
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,358
Then why did you choose
the cardiovascular department

434
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,068
when it's the toughest?

435
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,903
Being a heart surgeon is cool.

436
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:56,740
I don't want doctors to take me
as a lightweight later on.

437
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:02,078
How about you try your best
since you've decided to be a doctor?

438
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,289
Change your attitude first.

439
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,498
Hey, Crystal.

440
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,835
I've lived a sheltered life
for 28 years with special privileges.

441
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,588
How can I change that now?
It's the others that need to change.

442
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:13,965
And what's the point?

443
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,800
I'm not going to be a doctor
for the rest of my life.

444
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,302
There's no need to work my butt off.

445
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,476
Yes. Who is this?

446
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,644
Yes, Doctor.

447
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,147
An operation? But why would I?

448
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:33,693
I'd really like to be there
but I'm not feeling well right now.

449
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,655
He hung up on me.

450
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:43,286
Why do I need to
observe Dr. Cha performing surgery?

451
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,733
Why are there so many interns?

452
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:16,986
Watching you operate
is a great learning experience for them.

453
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,822
And this is a rare opportunity.

454
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,199
Plus, they wouldn't want to
miss this complex procedure.

455
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,993
What's there to see?
It's just another surgery.

456
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,253
You punk. You're late on your first day.

457
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,213
Wear a surgical gown and come back.

458
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:43,930
Stand close behind me.

459
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,395
The operation will start.

460
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,898
This is the fifth operation
for the patient.

461
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:57,193
There could be fused tissue,
so we have to carefully open up the chest.

462
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:01,781
Shall we begin?

463
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:02,782
Scalpel.

464
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,380
Bovie.

465
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:39,569
Give me the Bovie.

466
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,913
Done. Switch places.

467
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,336
Army navy retractor.

468
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,424
Hand me the retractor.

469
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,385
Hold it.

470
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,138
All right. RA first.

471
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:42,799
ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR HAN SEUNG-WON

472
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:45,927
Yes? This is Han Seung-won.

473
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,556
Then let's say tonight.

474
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,684
You don't need to worry about that.

475
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,644
The main procedure is over.

476
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,146
We'll perform
transesophageal echocardiography.

477
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,148
There's no aortic valve paravalvular leak.

478
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,403
No leakage around the stitches.

479
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:06,072
The average systolic pressure
stayed below 1.5 m/s.

480
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:09,325
No blood vessels narrowed.
So the operation is a success.

481
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,914
Seung-tak.

482
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,085
What is a bioprosthetic aortic valve?

483
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,380
A bioprosthetic aortic valve

484
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:25,550
is generally made of
either bovine pericardium

485
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,969
or porcine aortic valves,
but may also be produced

486
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,388
from the equine or porcine pericardium.

487
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,724
The early onset of calcification

488
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:35,268
being the primary cause
of biomaterial breakdown…

489
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,437
Very good.

490
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,775
I'm going to remove the RA cannula.

491
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,862
Tie it up yourself.
You can do that, can't you?

492
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,120
Come on.

493
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:06,299
But on the first day
of dissecting a cadaver,

494
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,259
he had to make an incision on the stomach.

495
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,440
What are you doing?

496
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,108
You don't know how to do it?

497
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,403
Hey, Seung-tak!

498
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,197
No, I don't want to do it.

499
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,200
After that day,
he missed every anatomy class.

500
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,243
He would give excuses for being absent.

501
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,663
Seung-tak, are you…

502
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,498
Move it.

503
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:02,188
-Great work, Doctor.
-It was an honor.

504
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:05,942
Do you know

505
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,988
which students do the worst
in learning English conversation?

506
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:12,782
It's the students
who got high English test scores.

507
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,742
They assume that their test score

508
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,495
makes them better at English.

509
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,872
Getting high English scores
for ten years is meaningless

510
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,624
if you can't complete
a single sentence in English.

511
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,668
It's the same with surgery.

512
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,503
If you only rely on books to learn,

513
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,881
you'll become like your senior here.

514
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,678
He's a polished speaker
but he can't operate on a patient.

515
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,015
So what if he was born
with a silver spoon?

516
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,349
His hands are useless.

517
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,352
You're not special either.

518
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,645
That's who you are.

519
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,524
When a patient is on the verge of death,

520
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:53,656
would you choose a skilled doctor
who is arrogant and rude

521
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,868
or a warmhearted doctor who lacks skills?

522
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:01,831
You don't save patients

523
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,710
with your heart.

524
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:09,881
You use your brain and your hands.

525
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,091
Remember that.

526
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,053
We, doctors, are not emotional laborers.

527
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,847
We have to be specialists
with skills to match.

528
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,557
So…

529
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,560
don't waste your time

530
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,563
trying to obtain prestigious titles…

531
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:34,113
without having the skills to back them up.

532
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,031
That's all.

533
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,134
Your hands are useless

534
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:58,096
My hands are golden

535
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,185
I love golden hands

536
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,688
You know this, right?

537
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:11,609
People look up to me
with respect and admiration.

538
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,487
But I met this punk today at the hospital

539
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,615
who kept irritating me with his attitude.

540
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,451
He's a successor?

541
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,329
He can't even operate.

542
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:25,748
Cha Mandu.

543
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:27,834
Now answer me.

544
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,419
Do I let people trample over me?

545
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,462
Of course, not.

546
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:35,258
So I called him over
to the operating room.

547
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,426
Whereupon, I showed him who's the boss.

548
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:42,598
How dare he try to challenge me.
When he can't even operate.

549
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,602
It's all right. I beat him.

550
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,939
He probably won’t show up
for work tomorrow.

551
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:54,986
What if he does?

552
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,322
If he does, well…

553
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,658
I'll have to come up

554
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:02,618
with a new strategy.

555
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,329
So I've been thinking about that.

556
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,291
Should I wear a brand new suit tomorrow?

557
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:10,501
Or should I buy a new car

558
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,212
once I pay off the monthly installments?

559
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,857
Good morning, Doctor.

560
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,819
You showed up for work.

561
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,988
Of course. This is where I work.

562
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:41,199
You're mentally tough.

563
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,075
As the next chairman, I have to be tough.

564
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:53,211
You're walking too close to me
given your social status and reputation?

565
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,588
People who think like that
are called stuffy, old fogeys.

566
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:58,049
We live in an egalitarian society now.

567
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,468
How about you work on learning
how to become a doctor first?

568
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,594
Start practicing the tie first.

569
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,304
I need to be able to cater to a genius.

570
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,264
I happen to have good business acumen.

571
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,225
Tell that to your grandfather.
You never know.

572
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,227
He might change his mind about you.

573
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,020
He changes his mind all the time.

574
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,105
So it's not necessary to tell him that.

575
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,140
-Go ahead without me.
-Why?

576
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:56,565
Did you seriously ask me that?
Do you think we're friends?

577
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,447
Gosh, he asked me a million questions.

578
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,740
Are you two friends?

579
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:05,908
You surprised me.

580
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:07,910
That's how it goes.

581
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:11,080
Friendships blossom over fights.
Your enemy becomes your best friend.

582
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,999
I'm always the victim.

583
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,793
Don't be so harsh on yourself.
Do you want coffee?

584
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:17,962
What did I do to deserve this?

585
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,631
-What?
-Good morning.

586
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:21,924
I'll have a cup of coffee.

587
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,509
He's getting his coffee there again.

588
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,637
Where?

589
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,473
It's his spot where he drinks coffee
all by himself.

590
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:31,767
Thanks.

591
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:38,149
There's a secret spot in my hospital
that I didn't know about?

592
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:42,486
Hey, you shouldn't go there.
Don't bother him.

593
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:54,934
How have you been?

594
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,354
It's been a while.

595
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,903
You look great.

596
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,201
Do you still have your coffee here?

597
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,510
Yes? This is Cha Young-min.

598
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:33,264
I was having a cup of coffee
but had an unwelcome encounter.

599
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,059
No, I'll be right there.

600
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:40,229
This coffee tastes bitter.

601
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,640
This is…

602
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,392
Is this the case from the conference?

603
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,769
Yes, it's the cardiac sarcoma patient.

604
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,438
I didn't mention it yesterday,

605
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:25,316
but that patient is Jang Gwang-deok,
chairman of the Cheonmyung Group.

606
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,402
He was admitted here last night
under tight secrecy.

607
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,654
We can't let the press know
about his condition.

608
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,156
That's why we called you here separately.

609
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,283
So please understand, Dr. Cha.

610
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:36,494
I already gave you my prognosis yesterday.

611
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,204
I heard you.

612
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,371
But I also told you

613
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:42,416
that his son wants surgery.
That's his son.

614
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,501
He's the vice president
of the Cheonmyung Group.

615
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:46,629
I'm Jang Min-ho.

616
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,298
You probably didn't know
who I was yesterday.

617
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,717
Now that you know who I am,

618
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,260
could you reconsider your position?

619
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,346
Seriously.

620
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,519
Still…

621
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,104
I'm his only son.

622
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,399
I can't see him die
without doing whatever I can.

623
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:11,487
So I kindly ask you, Dr. Cha,
the top heart surgeon in Korea,

624
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:15,574
to reconsider your decision.

625
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:16,659
He has diabetes and high blood pressure.

626
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:19,370
He previously suffered a stroke.
There's also his age.

627
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,331
It'll take a heavy toll on the patient
if we proceed.

628
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:23,499
Even if I agree to operate on him,

629
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,752
the tumor is located deep
in the left auricle and pulmonary vein.

630
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,337
It'll be difficult
to completely remove it.

631
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,214
It will regrow in three months.

632
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,132
He won't live long.

633
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:35,469
Even without an operation,
my dad won't live long, right?

634
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:40,558
Please operate on him
so that we can save face.

635
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,230
I can't help save face for you

636
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,149
at the expense of hurting my career.

637
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,334
Today's operation schedule?

638
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,377
Here you are.

639
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:14,049
I want Seung-tak out of my sight.

640
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:16,594
What?

641
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,346
He bumbled through his internship.

642
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,015
That's why he doesn't have the basics.

643
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,766
Have him start at ER.

644
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,061
What?

645
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,313
Something wrong?

646
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,898
Then go and tattle to your grandfather.

647
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:31,483
Or go and tell your mom.

648
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,283
You heard him.

649
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,789
Why is he in a bad mood?

650
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,082
Did you say something?

651
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:49,168
It wasn't me this time.

652
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,171
What do I need to do at ER?

653
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:55,174
As if you'd survive.
Just answer calls from the nurse station.

654
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:58,636
I got a call.

655
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:00,471
Mr. Kim?

656
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,516
You all know who I am, right?

657
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,435
I'm sure you've heard the rumor.

658
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,522
Yes, we know you.

659
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,358
The doctor who loves to bluff.

660
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:15,861
I like how you try to
learn new things about me.

661
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:18,113
But not in front of everyone.
It's inappropriate.

662
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,699
You're worse than me.
Take all of this away before I get mad.

663
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,368
Why would I take it away?

664
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:23,744
It's okay.

665
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,746
You can accept it.
It's a luxury brand, you know.

666
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:29,541
You still don't get it, do you?

667
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,754
Dr. Lee. Can you assign Dr. Koh to me?

668
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,547
What? Yes.

669
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:37,716
She can, right?

670
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,593
We started med school in the same year,

671
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,763
but you only started your internship now
since you took too much time off school.

672
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:44,306
You don't seem to know this,

673
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,684
but there's a pecking order
in the hospital system.

674
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,102
Follow me before I get mad.

675
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:50,729
You'll regret it.

676
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:58,195
What is this?
The pecking order is reversed?

677
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:01,573
That must hurt!

678
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:04,410
That hurts.

679
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:08,956
Move it.

680
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:10,999
I'm sorry.

681
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:20,300
How can you make me wait so long?

682
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,802
Do you know who I am?

683
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,846
Sir, do you know who I am?

684
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,806
You piece of crap.

685
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,266
I want to see a real doctor!

686
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:29,601
I want to talk to the hospital director!

687
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,603
I'm in a higher position than them.

688
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,021
So you can speak to me.

689
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,773
Hey, are you kidding me?

690
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:37,067
How is that possible, you punk?

691
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,778
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

692
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,698
Dad.

693
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,868
This is Dr. Cha,
the heart surgeon I told you about.

694
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,666
Hello, sir. I'm Cha Young-min.

695
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,961
Oh, Dr. Cha.

696
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,922
I heard a lot about you.

697
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:05,095
You're the top heart surgeon in Korea.

698
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:06,930
I'm flattered.

699
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,824
This is my youngest daughter.

700
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:31,538
I'm Jang Se-jin.

701
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,502
My daughter

702
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:38,462
is also a doctor.

703
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:45,511
She works at a famous hospital
in Seattle, USA.

704
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:50,432
But since I got sick,

705
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:53,852
she came all the way here to care for me.

706
00:46:55,979 --> 00:47:00,275
I have conflicting feelings about parting

707
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:06,698
with my precious son and daughter
sooner than I expected.

708
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:13,163
My son tells me there's a procedure
which you perform.

709
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:18,961
I'd like to hear your honest opinion
as a specialist.

710
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:23,507
That's why I requested to
personally see you.

711
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:38,855
I've heard your story.

712
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,609
You were reunited with your rich dad.

713
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:46,321
You were on a whole different level,
Ms. Jang Se-jin.

714
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,324
And Young-min,

715
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,619
you became a famous surgeon.

716
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:55,956
I'm not in the mood

717
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,250
to catch up with you like old friends.

718
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,293
What do you want?

719
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,962
Did you come to ask me

720
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,965
to operate on your dad?

721
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:06,091
No.

722
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:07,926
I'm against it.

723
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:12,806
I reviewed my dad's hospital records
with my colleagues.

724
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:16,602
I think I came to
the same conclusion you did

725
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,770
as a doctor.

726
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,150
I think it's ethical

727
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,945
to let my dad die peacefully

728
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,031
instead of having him go through
such a risky operation.

729
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,782
Who called it a risky operation?

730
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:34,995
Are you saying that because
you still hold a--

731
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,413
Se-jin.

732
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:38,874
You still think

733
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:42,461
I'm that bratty intern
you knew 12 years ago?

734
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:48,467
What?

735
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:51,053
Your dad didn't write his will yet?

736
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:52,679
Or…

737
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,307
do you not like what's in your Dad's will?

738
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:56,933
What would you like me to do?

739
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,228
Should I let him die

740
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:02,314
or save his life?

741
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,108
Your dad, I mean.

742
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,072
So this is what you ended up becoming.

743
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,275
I have something to tell you.

744
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,319
If I don't tell you now,
I might never be able to say it.

745
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,237
Se-jin…

746
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:53,990
I'll wait for you there.

747
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,296
Se-jin.

748
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,173
Se-jin!

749
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:16,430
She went to America
for a training program.

750
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:18,223
She's probably on her flight already.

751
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:21,309
I heard Se-jin got reunited
with her biological dad.

752
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:24,730
She's starting a new life
since her dad is wealthy.

753
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:27,816
She's got it made.
I thought she was dating Young-min.

754
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:29,609
Can't you tell what's happening?

755
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:30,944
She dumped him.

756
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:33,989
She's rich now so she's
no longer interested in a poor intern.

757
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:51,423
So this is what you ended up becoming.

758
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:56,261
No.

759
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,388
You don't know

760
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:00,932
the kind of doctor I became.

761
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:10,650
This is Cha Young-min.

762
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:14,070
EUNSANG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

763
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,034
Did you reschedule the operations?

764
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,077
Yes, I did.

765
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,915
But do you have to do this surgery?

766
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:26,041
Don't worry.

767
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,877
If we do an autotransplantation,
we've got a chance.

768
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,921
Seung-joo was supposed
to get surgery at that time slot.

769
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:31,922
Hey.

770
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,257
That's not an urgent operation.

771
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:35,717
We can delay that for a day or two.

772
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:38,303
But this is a risky operation.
And the tumor will likely regrow.

773
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:42,015
Doctor, you usually turn down
operations like this.

774
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:43,141
Ahn Tae-hyun.

775
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:45,644
How many years have you been a fellow?

776
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:47,979
I'm in my fourth year.

777
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:50,440
Next year, you'll be
under review to join the faculty.

778
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,108
They'll begin
accepting applications soon, right?

779
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:57,364
The patient's son said

780
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,115
I'll get his full backing
if I do this surgery.

781
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:03,495
That means you'll get
a career boost too, Dr. Ahn.

782
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,163
Okay?

783
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:08,834
Isn't that why you've endured
my behavior these past years?

784
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:14,923
I'll get prepared…

785
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:18,593
for the surgery.

786
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,654
Shall we begin?

787
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:20,655
Scalpel.

788
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:25,285
CURRENT TIME
TIME IN SURGERY, TIME UNDER ANESTHESIA

789
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:32,667
Suction.

790
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:55,857
All right.

791
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:58,902
We're removing the heart.

792
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,612
-Focus.
-Yes, Doctor.

793
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:22,592
Pull it a little more.

794
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:38,316
Hey. Hold it steady, okay?

795
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,111
If I damage the mitra
because of you, will you fix it?

796
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:42,570
Stay focused!

797
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,155
I'm sorry.

798
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:08,555
Doctor.

799
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,850
I'll stay and watch over him.
So please get some rest.

800
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:15,103
He hasn't woken up yet.
I'm not going anywhere.

801
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:25,780
Who could it be?

802
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,533
LET'S MEET UP. CAN YOU COME RIGHT NOW?

803
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,456
I'll be right back.

804
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:35,999
Stay by the patient's side.

805
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:38,043
Call me if there's any change
in his condition.

806
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:42,172
-I think the driver is still in the car.
-He's still inside.

807
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:44,549
-Oh no.
-Really?

808
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:47,927
-Why aren't the paramedics here?
-Why is the ambulance taking so long?

809
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,474
-He's bleeding a lot.
-He lost a lot of blood.

810
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:07,947
I mean he swerved towards me.

811
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,157
That car over there.

812
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:14,204
When will they get here?
The driver is dying. Please hurry!

813
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:17,916
-Darn it.
-He's dying. Oh, no.

814
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:22,170
I'm a doctor. Let me have a look at him.

815
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:24,339
Why isn't the ambulance here?

816
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:26,257
Hey, can you hear me?

817
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,175
Hey.

818
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:35,183
Could you stand back?

819
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,062
I told you to stand back.

820
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:41,523
Damn it.

821
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,782
-Over here!
-Hurry!

822
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,369
Sir, can you hear my voice?

823
00:56:58,206 --> 00:56:59,457
His heart stopped.

824
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,376
Do you have a defibrillator
in the ambulance? Go and bring it.

825
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:03,586
Excuse me.

826
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:05,505
Hey!

827
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:09,968
Move it.

828
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:12,637
There's another person inside.

829
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,474
Over here! Bring the stretcher!

830
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,084
Yes, Jae-won.

831
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,920
Hey, Seung-tak, where are you right now?

832
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,505
I'm at the ER, of course.

833
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,131
You know that thing I asked for…

834
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,259
I can't hear you.
What am I doing right now?

835
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:36,596
We just got a bunch of emergency patients.

836
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:42,185
What?

837
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:43,603
They're really here.

838
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:45,313
Hey Seung-tak.

839
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:47,524
Why is it so loud there?

840
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:49,859
Hey Seung-tak.

841
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,322
RESTRICTED ACCESS

842
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:01,704
He's a TA patient.

843
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,040
He was on a motorcycle and hit a car.

844
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:05,208
This way.

845
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:18,846
911 RESCUE

846
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:28,064
This is the driver
whose car crashed into the motorcycle.

847
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,234
Dr. Cha Young-min!

848
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:35,071
What? He's a doctor at this hospital?

849
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:37,240
Yes, this way. Hurry.

850
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:11,524
-The patient is Dr. Cha Young-min.
-What?

851
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:17,113
-All right. Three, two, one.
-Doctor.

852
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:19,282
-Be careful.
-His chest hit the steering wheel.

853
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:20,908
Blood pressure is 80, 40.
Pulse is 120 beats.

854
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:22,285
That's right.

855
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:23,870
I hit my chest on the steering wheel.

856
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:25,663
It's probably a tamponade.

857
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:27,206
Or a rupture.

858
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,751
Get the operating room ready.
Go straight to surgery.

859
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:31,377
There's no time for a CT scan.

860
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,796
What are you doing?
Prepare the operating room. Call CS.

861
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,590
Right. Do a cardiac ultrasound. Okay?

862
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:38,551
CS isn't answering.

863
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,970
What? Why aren't they answering?
Who's on call at CS?

864
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:44,641
Seung-tak.

865
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:47,018
-Why aren't you answering the call?
-What?

866
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:48,728
You're on call today?

867
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:50,730
-What? He's supposed to be on call?
-Who put him in charge?

868
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:52,315
It can't be him.

869
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:53,983
Right. Ahn Tae-hyun.

870
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:57,153
-Call Dr. Ahn.
-It's Dr. Cha. Go and treat the patient.

871
01:00:58,404 --> 01:00:59,739
He can't treat me.

872
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:01,491
He only studied a tamponade
in a medical textbook.

873
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:03,451
-How would he know what to do?
-Cardiac ultrasound machine.

874
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:07,413
Give me the cardiac ultrasound. Fast.

875
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:11,167
Hey, you have to be careful
when you use it.

876
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,669
You don't know how to use it.

877
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:14,796
You know where to check?

878
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:19,300
You do? You know?

879
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:28,685
Seung-tak. Here.
You see the blood clotting here?

880
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:31,979
It's a tamponade or rupture.
Stop it through surgery.

881
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:33,898
Right there. You see it?

882
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:36,859
I see blood clotting there.

883
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:39,529
I think it's a tamponade.
We have to operate now and stop it.

884
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:41,948
What are you all doing?
Move my body to the operating table!

885
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:46,160
-Soo-jung, hold him. Go to OR.
-All right. Let's go to OR now.

886
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:49,122
Find someone who can operate on him.
Hurry. You have to find someone quickly.

887
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,169
What's taking them so long?

888
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:56,629
It's 90 and 112.

889
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,131
All right. I'm fine for now.

890
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,139
Hang in there.

891
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:07,640
You can do it.

892
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:14,021
Answer your phone! Please!

893
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:16,065
I'm going crazy.

894
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,487
His blood pressure is falling.

895
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:24,073
Dr. Cha is going to die at this rate.

896
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:26,743
Why isn't anyone coming?

897
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,167
All right.

898
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:36,252
Just this one time. Please.

899
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:39,005
Please.

900
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:40,965
Please.

901
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:46,929
I've saved so many patients

902
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:50,641
in this operating room.

903
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:54,353
How can there not be
one surgeon around to save me?

904
01:02:56,814 --> 01:02:59,734
Out of all the surgeons,
why is Seung-tak the only one here?

905
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,528
This is bad. Call the emergency room.

906
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:06,240
Give me the scalpel.

907
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:11,287
What are you doing? Don't tell me you're…

908
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,915
-Hand me the scalpel!
-You're a first-year resident, right?

909
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:15,458
I can't let you do that!

910
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:17,960
You said he'll die
if we don't do anything.

911
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:19,378
Should I let him die then?

912
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:22,381
Hey, Seung-tak.

913
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,467
There's no time. Give it to me.

914
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:38,439
I'm not taking responsibility for this.

915
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:39,899
What are you talking about?

916
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:42,652
Dr. Oh! You have to stop him!

917
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:44,153
He doesn't even know
how to pull a cannula out.

918
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:46,155
How can you put my life in his hands?

919
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,954
His blood pressure dropped again.
We can't wait any longer.

920
01:03:53,037 --> 01:03:54,205
Wait a minute!

921
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:01,587
All right.

922
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:04,382
I like your spirit. You want to help.

923
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:05,341
Fine.

924
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:07,677
But have you ever held a scalpel before?

925
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:09,679
All right.

926
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:11,347
I know you don't have any other options.

927
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:13,599
Calm down.

928
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:15,518
Relax. Take deep breaths.

929
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:17,436
Inhale, exhale.

930
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:20,815
Inhale, exhale. Good.

931
01:04:20,898 --> 01:04:22,650
I've been through this. I know it's scary.

932
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:25,403
Of course, it's scary.
You've never done this before.

933
01:04:25,486 --> 01:04:26,863
But you know me, right?
When I was an intern…

934
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:28,614
Anyway…

935
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:31,158
You can do it too.
Not anybody can pull it off.

936
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:33,870
You have to believe in yourself.

937
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:36,539
Envision the procedure in your head.

938
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:38,374
You're good with theory.

939
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:41,377
Stop! Not there, you punk!

940
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,713
Do you have something against me?

941
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:46,507
You do? Okay.

942
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,467
I understand. But now is not the time.

943
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:51,512
Save my life and don't let
your emotions get in the way.

944
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,723
I said not there, you punk!

945
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:15,536
Dr. Koh. What are you doing?

946
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:16,871
Are you doing it or not?

947
01:05:29,508 --> 01:05:31,010
What just happened?

948
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:31,928
I can't believe it.

949
01:05:34,805 --> 01:05:36,557
Hey! Seung-tak!

950
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:06,587
Shall we begin?

951
01:06:07,588 --> 01:06:09,131
Ms. Oh. Stand in as my first.

952
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:12,802
Focus now!

953
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,012
Stand closer!

954
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:37,910
Blunt retractor.

955
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:02,184
My…

956
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:04,645
My heart…

957
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:44,143
I can't slack off at work tomorrow

958
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:45,728
because they found out
the skills I've been hiding.

959
01:07:45,811 --> 01:07:48,814
How could he not know
what's happened to him?

960
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,566
Come with me. Come here, Seung-tak.

961
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:53,069
Be careful, Nurse Jung.

962
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:54,737
I said be careful, Nurse Jung!

963
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:57,323
A coma ghost can't possess
a person's body.

964
01:07:57,406 --> 01:07:59,158
But you can.

965
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:00,326
Where did that punk go, Dr. Ahn?

966
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:01,327
Which punk are you talking about?

967
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:02,912
The operation was flawless.

968
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:05,372
One of the heart surgeons is in my pocket.

969
