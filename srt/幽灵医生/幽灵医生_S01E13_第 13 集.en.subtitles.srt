1
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:32,907
It's hot.

2
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,912
Seung-tak, put on your life jacket.

3
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,248
Hurry. Wear it.

4
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,501
Dad! There's a big--

5
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,006
Seung-tak!

6
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,948
Doctor, his blood oxygen levels
are falling.

7
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,074
What?

8
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:58,743
What can we do?

9
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,411
We need to use ECMO.

10
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:04,415
But Dr. Oh isn't here.

11
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,542
Oh, no.

12
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,423
Hey, Seung-tak! Where are you going?

13
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,018
What was the cause of death?

14
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:08,479
Patient went into shock after losing blood
due to a tear in his aorta.

15
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:09,981
Was there a medical mistake?

16
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:13,693
We can't blame Dr. Koh because
the patient's blood pressure plummeted

17
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,653
while they were waiting for Dr. Jung.

18
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,823
Something had to be done to prevent it.

19
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,783
When they opened up the patient,
his aorta had burst already.

20
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,660
It's not a mistake then?

21
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,704
A resident would have

22
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:29,125
applied pressure using their hands
while waiting for the surgeon.

23
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:32,128
In his haste to save the patient,
Dr. Koh tried to operate…

24
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:35,215
Moreover, the patient suffered
from high blood pressure.

25
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,593
So his aorta was larger
than the average person's.

26
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,720
Which means his aorta was weakened.

27
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,224
Anyway, under the circumstances,

28
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,517
Dr. Koh did the best he could do.

29
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,728
Are you reading from a script?

30
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,356
I get the sense that you're covering
for each other.

31
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,399
Is that what you'll tell the family?

32
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,736
Of course, we must take responsibility
for what happened to the patient.

33
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,197
We failed to fulfill our moral obligation.

34
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,492
It's hard to call it a malpractice case.

35
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,577
We'll see about that after a review.

36
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,665
But what are you doing here, Dr. Ban?

37
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,668
-What?
-Don't you have an operation to do?

38
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,755
The operation will be canceled?
What do you mean?

39
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,926
It's not a delay?
It'll be canceled entirely?

40
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,845
We're dealing with a problem right now.

41
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,515
The senior doctors are all preoccupied.

42
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:29,227
I don't know what it could be
but what about his surgery?

43
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,312
Then when will it be rescheduled?

44
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,355
It's hard to tell.

45
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,190
Where is Dr. Koh right now?

46
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,858
Well, you see…

47
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,988
The problem involves Dr. Koh.

48
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,629
Seung-tak!

49
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,840
Stop right there.
You can't leave like this.

50
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,009
Seung-tak!

51
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,309
Seung-tak!

52
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,024
Seung-tak!

53
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:17,900
Seung-tak!

54
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,778
Seung-tak!

55
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,490
Why that punk…

56
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,328
I told you so.

57
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,914
I warned you to be careful.

58
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:38,337
I was kicked out of his body
during surgery.

59
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,506
I tried to enter his body, but I couldn't.

60
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,135
Why did it have to happen at that moment?

61
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,596
Even if it didn't,
you would've lost the patient.

62
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:50,516
You should've stopped
when you felt something was wrong.

63
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,437
You had to enter his body
to try to save someone.

64
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,106
It wasn't me this time.

65
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,859
I saw the desperation in his eyes.

66
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,200
It must have been the same look you had.

67
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,620
If he was that desperate,
he should've done it himself.

68
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,498
That would've been
the wiser career choice.

69
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,542
When he returns,
make sure he doesn't do that again.

70
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,377
I don't know if he'll come back.

71
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,881
I realized something
after experiencing that.

72
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,926
I could never operate on a patient.

73
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:28,721
I might not be able to save lives,
but I don't want to let anyone die.

74
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,014
It's my fault.

75
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,974
I shouldn't have entered his body.

76
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:37,146
Then he wouldn't have lost a patient
he was operating on.

77
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,859
If you knew it was a mistake,
why are you wringing your hands

78
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:45,321
and blaming yourself?

79
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,865
You need to think of a way to fix this.

80
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:53,162
Both of you are so pathetic.

81
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,873
I should punch you in the throat.

82
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,417
I'm off.

83
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,343
-Is that Seung-tak? What did he say?
-The number you have dialed…

84
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:09,095
-Where is he?
-…cannot be reached.

85
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,848
Why did he turn off his phone?

86
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,683
Come on. Answer your phone.

87
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,437
Why did Seung-tak act so recklessly?

88
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,772
He thinks he can save every patient.

89
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,441
It got to his head.

90
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,610
He only has himself to blame for this.
He was overconfident.

91
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,945
How can you criticize him?

92
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,451
If it were you, you wouldn't
have been able to do anything.

93
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,621
Seung-tak tried his best
to save the patient.

94
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,212
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached.

95
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,797
Please leave a message…

96
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,090
-Intern Oh.
-…after the tone.

97
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,384
-Did you get a hold of him?
-Isn't he answering?

98
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,554
His phone is turned off.
He's not checking his messages either.

99
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:53,973
Didn't expect this reaction.

100
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,558
After running out of surgery,
he went AWOL.

101
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,435
It's a big shock, of course.

102
00:07:57,518 --> 00:08:00,521
I knew he would
get in big trouble someday.

103
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,941
-He was getting too cocky.
-I'll punch you in the throat.

104
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,611
Should a doctor act like a bystander
and not do anything?

105
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,906
Doctors are supposed to intervene
to save lives.

106
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,991
Patients aren't something
we have to avoid.

107
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,832
-Have you checked the hotels?
-We've called all the hotels in the city.

108
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,753
He left his car in the parking lot.
So that makes it harder.

109
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,172
He must have not gone home then.

110
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,007
He's not home yet?

111
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,682
I couldn't reach him on his phone,
so I came to find him.

112
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,476
It must've been a shock.

113
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,103
The whole family is worried,
so he should've gone home.

114
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,605
Don't worry too much.

115
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,607
He needs time to process it.

116
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:49,153
Seung-tak is stronger
than you think he is.

117
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,404
I'm sure

118
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,532
he'll be back soon.

119
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,370
-Thanks.
-Don't worry about the operation.

120
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:01,457
I'll make sure his family is treated well.

121
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,833
You know what I do.

122
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,961
This is my job.

123
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,297
Seung-won.

124
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,886
Your uncle. Seung-tak's dad.

125
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,181
He died while trying to save Seung-tak.

126
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,810
-You know that, don't you?
-Of course.

127
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,521
In a boating accident 20 years ago.

128
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,233
And the shock he had from that day

129
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,026
had made him this way.

130
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,988
You remember that, right?

131
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:37,201
He used to be a cheerful
and very thoughtful child.

132
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,912
But after the accident,

133
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:45,376
he had totally changed for years.

134
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,682
I'm afraid, Seung-won.

135
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,436
I'm worried he'll go far away again.

136
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:13,779
Why did you encourage him
to become a doctor if he was so precious?

137
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,949
You know what goes on at a hospital.

138
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,077
You didn't foresee that
this was bound to happen?

139
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,706
It would have been nice
if you had made him quit the hospital.

140
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,709
I clearly gave you a chance.

141
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:37,011
I understand the situation.
But Dr. Cha needs this surgery.

142
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,473
If Dr. Koh can't do it,
there are other surgeons, right?

143
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:45,061
But Seung-tak has to be present
during Dr. Cha's operation.

144
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,270
Who said so?

145
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,648
Did Dr. Ban say that?

146
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,900
Actually, I agree with him.

147
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,235
We're talking about Dr. Cha's operation.

148
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:57,239
So I believe our genius surgeon,
Seung-tak needs to handle it.

149
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,158
I know Dr. Koh has exceptional skills.

150
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,826
But he's just a first-year resident.

151
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,746
He's not just any first-year.
He's as good as a star doctor.

152
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,289
It wasn't always like this,

153
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,417
but he became this good since he operated
on Dr. Cha's tamponade case.

154
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,170
He's been doing complicated surgeries
by himself since.

155
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:26,435
It's hard to blame the lead surgeon
for the patient's death.

156
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,105
It wasn't that the doctor showed neglect
while the patient was fading.

157
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,191
If we were to suspend the doctor over this
when he tried his best,

158
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:35,361
the whole medical community
will be in uproar including our hospital.

159
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,863
You make it sound like I'm blaming him.

160
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,490
Don't try so hard.

161
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:42,201
Just follow the procedures
and medical report.

162
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,956
The hospital will cover all funeral costs.

163
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,667
And offer a hefty compensation
to the family.

164
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,169
Yes, sir.

165
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,631
What about the suspension of Dr. Koh
that you asked me to pursue?

166
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:58,217
What's the point? It's over for him.

167
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,969
It's a hassle and distraction.

168
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,554
Forget about it.

169
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,014
Seung-tak won't return to the hospital.

170
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,143
Right. He can't.

171
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,564
Process his resignation letter
when he submits it later.

172
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:17,236
I feel a chill down my spine.
You must be here, Dr. Cha.

173
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:21,824
You can tell?

174
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,326
Go ahead and jump out the window.

175
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,828
Before I push you myself.

176
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,457
Were you plotting again
to get rid of Seung-tak?

177
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,042
Seung-tak suffered a tragic loss.

178
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,420
So you think he'll implode
without your prodding?

179
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,006
It's not me.

180
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,885
Dr. Cha, you ruined Seung-tak's life.

181
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:44,013
-What?
-I didn't do anything to him.

182
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,141
You're the one who clipped his wings.
Why did you go that far?

183
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,854
What did you do to him
when he's emotionally unstable?

184
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:02,364
Let's look at the facts now.
I didn't put you in your predicament.

185
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,283
You were just unlucky.

186
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,161
Stop blaming others.

187
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,996
I feel sorry for Seung-tak.

188
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:13,626
Why did you do all those surgeries
while inside his body?

189
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:17,838
You've been using my cousin
so that you could survive.

190
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,591
Now look what you've done.

191
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,636
EUNSANG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

192
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,725
Do you feel better now?

193
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:33,938
No.

194
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,065
It pains me.

195
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,902
I didn't know about his personal tragedy.

196
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:41,779
I'm worried.

197
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,740
He's got a weak constitution
and it could get weaker.

198
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,158
I'm frustrated.

199
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,077
I want to talk to him but I can't leave.

200
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,417
Why am I talking to myself?

201
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:02,341
But you're wrong about one thing.

202
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:05,177
Nobody clipped his wings.

203
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,762
His life isn't over.

204
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:09,974
You don't know him.
You don't know him like I do.

205
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,644
I was told you said

206
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,980
that Dr. Koh had to be present
in Cha's surgery.

207
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,274
So you did.

208
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,485
So you have. Well, you see…

209
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:25,114
Even though he's just a first-year
resident, he's our best surgeon.

210
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,533
You haven't seen him operate
so it could be hard to believe.

211
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,703
Dr. Ban, have you seen
Dr. Koh operate then?

212
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,788
Of course, I saw it.

213
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,206
Many times.

214
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,210
This isn't a matter
that should be publicized.

215
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:43,007
The first time Dr. Koh performed surgery,
our department was shocked.

216
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,385
It felt as if we were all possessed
seeing him operate like that.

217
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,972
If it just happened once,
I could write it off.

218
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,642
But he kept amazing us again and again.

219
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,644
His skills were just amazing.

220
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,109
It's on a supernatural level.
A total mystery.

221
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:05,195
Sometimes I think
he really is possessed by a spirit

222
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,073
and that he was gifted
by the heavens with his talent.

223
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:12,244
Did Dr. Koh tell you he would handle
Dr. Cha's surgery?

224
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,329
Of course.

225
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,749
With tears welled up in his eyes,
he pleaded to do it.

226
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,418
Dr. Koh is very determined
to save Dr. Cha.

227
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,837
And Dr. Koh came up
with the procedure himself.

228
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:26,216
So please wait a little more.
I think that's prudent.

229
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,888
If we can't wait any longer,
I can do the operation. I'll manage.

230
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:34,266
But I'd like our best doctor
to operate on Dr. Cha.

231
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:39,104
I am very fond of Dr. Cha.
He's a good friend.

232
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,941
-But you're asking me to wait?
-What?

233
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,567
I can't wait much longer.

234
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:47,780
If Dr. Koh is crucial to this surgery,
then please bring him back soon.

235
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,949
Otherwise, I'll ask someone else.

236
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,659
Dr. Koh…

237
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,411
will return.

238
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,123
He's a mysterious person and hard to read.

239
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,583
I do know one thing about him.

240
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:04,296
He cares about saving lives.

241
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,133
He's taken bold stances
that have humbled us.

242
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,827
Dr. Cha.

243
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,829
Are you here by any chance?

244
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,831
Can you hear me?

245
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:45,421
If you can, please give me a sign.

246
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,514
I'm sorry for intruding.

247
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,267
I didn't barge in. I knocked first.

248
00:16:58,934 --> 00:16:59,852
It's all right.

249
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,354
You're Dr. Oh Soo-jung, right?

250
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,149
You know me?

251
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,692
I saw you working in ER.

252
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,111
You're friends with Dr. Koh.

253
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,613
I was about to go down to talk to you.

254
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,532
Have you talked to Dr. Koh?

255
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,451
No, not yet.

256
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,662
I thought he'd answer your calls.

257
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,831
What brings you here?

258
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,375
Right. I almost forgot.

259
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,002
Did you have lunch?

260
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,131
I didn't know what you liked.
So I just ordered a quick meal.

261
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,511
Looks like people want to
treat me to lunch.

262
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,514
-What?
-Dr. Koh would always ask me

263
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,766
if I ate.

264
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,563
Dr. Koh would bring you lunch?

265
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,815
He never did that before.

266
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,650
He did good.

267
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,404
He would usually treat me to a stew lunch.

268
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,199
I wonder how he knew I liked stews.

269
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,784
Is that so?

270
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:01,163
He hates stew
because the broth makes him full quicker.

271
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,873
He knew your favorite foods.

272
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,835
Good for him. He never treated me to stew.

273
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:12,257
You came instead of Dr. Koh
to treat me to lunch?

274
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,093
Well…

275
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,012
I had to do something to help.

276
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,057
It didn't feel right to not do anything.

277
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:26,063
I can't do the things he did for you,
but I can bring you lunch.

278
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,732
I feel like I'm supporting Dr. Koh
in my own way

279
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,693
by taking over things he used to do.

280
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,739
By doing this, I hope he won't feel
that I didn't support him.

281
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,867
You're a good friend.

282
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,079
Not really.

283
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,292
I'm embarrassed for making you worry

284
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,627
when I'm your senior.

285
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:52,172
Thanks. I'll enjoy this lunch.

286
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,717
Dr. Koh told me once.

287
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,512
That I had to be strong
for Dr. Cha to get well.

288
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:00,973
I believe his words.

289
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,474
That's why I'm going to be strong.

290
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,810
So you don't have to worry about me.

291
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,812
Look after your friend, Dr. Koh.

292
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,898
He helped me a lot
when I had a tough time.

293
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:14,153
As you can see, my hands are full
caring for Dr. Cha.

294
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,738
I will.

295
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,575
-Let's cheer ourselves up with some food.
-Okay.

296
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,579
Enjoy.

297
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,331
-It looks good.
-Seung-tak has a good friend.

298
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,251
There are more people I need to repay.

299
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:33,630
Can a drowning person
wait until rescuers come?

300
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,132
-What?
-A patient can't wait

301
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,466
for a doctor to arrive.

302
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,885
I had a scary incident.

303
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,679
It was terrifying.

304
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,307
Because I was just eight at the time.

305
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:47,019
Where the heck is he right now?
All by himself…

306
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,699
My cooking skills are rusty.

307
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,912
I should've practiced cooking more.

308
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,883
EUNSANG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

309
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,638
The young doctor isn't coming,
and I'm here yawning.

310
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,475
I asked Hoon-gil to wait here with me,
but he left.

311
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,479
What?

312
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,068
Honey.

313
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,361
You heard the news, right?

314
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:41,573
Hye-jin is applying for lecturer positions
at multiple colleges.

315
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:45,994
Ji-won said she passed the first round
for a professorship at a local college.

316
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,497
Gosh. She just woke up from a coma.

317
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,583
There's no hurry.
You'll be able to catch up.

318
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:55,671
You'll be discharged in two weeks.
So you can double your efforts

319
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,506
to finish your thesis next year.

320
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,840
Mom, I'm reading.

321
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,718
-Can you be quiet so I can read?
-What?

322
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:05,264
I'm just concerned how you'll feel

323
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,225
since your friends are getting their PhDs
and becoming professors.

324
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:13,730
I never wanted to get a PhD
or become a professor.

325
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,607
That's what you want.

326
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,610
You're concerned that I won't be a PhD.

327
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,028
Amazing.

328
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,029
Yes!

329
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,865
What's gotten into you?

330
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,118
Is this because of post-traumatic stress?

331
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,746
L'idée de temps:
Cours au Collège de France 1901-1902

332
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,915
Did you bring this book, Mom?

333
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,042
Where and how did you know to get this?

334
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,877
What? Isn't that your book?

335
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,880
I only brought the books
that were in your room.

336
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,302
Did Soo-mi bring it?

337
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,059
Why am I hiding? I'm a ghost.

338
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,151
It must be the young doctor.

339
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,487
He's going to remind me he did that favor.

340
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:08,160
Why isn't the young doctor back?
Where is he? I still have one more favor.

341
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,102
Ahn Tae-hyun.

342
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,687
What are you doing here?

343
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,647
How dare you show up here!

344
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,447
Honey, how have you been?

345
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,077
Sorry for not visiting often.

346
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,290
Joon-young couldn't come since he went
to watch basketball with a friend.

347
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,959
He said his favorite player is playing.

348
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,545
So he told me to say sorry to you.

349
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,173
He promised to come later.

350
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,050
I see.

351
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,177
That's okay.

352
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,806
He's at the age to like players.
He wouldn't want to see me in a coma.

353
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,933
It would only make him sad.

354
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:17,479
You don't have to come frequently.
You're busy.

355
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,272
It's surprising.

356
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:24,820
I followed this recipe and it tastes
the way you used to make them.

357
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,656
Joon-young also likes them
and says they're tasty.

358
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,282
They're selling well now.

359
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,243
We'll become rich in no time.

360
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,913
What a relief.

361
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,582
That's good news.

362
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:42,462
But did you write this recipe down
and keep it with you?

363
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,924
It's not your handwriting.

364
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,677
Where did he get this recipe?

365
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,389
Why didn't you give it to me sooner?

366
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,099
You could've taught me.

367
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,519
We could've saved our old shop then.

368
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,688
I didn't want you to make walnut snacks.

369
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:01,898
I was going to do it.

370
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,704
You…

371
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,374
worked day and night

372
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,460
to keep the shop running.

373
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,757
I'm sorry

374
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,802
that I couldn't save the shop.

375
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,353
I should be sorry…

376
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,232
for putting you through so much.

377
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,277
I'm so sorry.

378
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,656
That young man said something funny.

379
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,409
He said we should visit
because you were waiting for us.

380
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:55,869
That's none of his business.

381
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:59,956
I was going to thank him.

382
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,167
But he's on vacation today.

383
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,086
So that's what he said.

384
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:07,964
I'll tell him you were grateful.

385
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:25,482
Look. Our guy is here.

386
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,401
Dr. Ahn. It's been a while.

387
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:32,197
What? What are you plotting now?

388
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:40,038
Why did you call me here?

389
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:42,123
You need your job back, right?

390
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,292
-What?
-Of course.

391
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,420
We can't let a great doctor like Dr. Ahn
be on leave.

392
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:51,508
I heard that doctors get rusty
if they rest for too long.

393
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,009
Right?

394
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:58,265
A doctor suddenly pulled out
right ahead of an important operation.

395
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,558
You have a patient who needs a doctor.

396
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,477
A patient?

397
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,897
Who is the patient?

398
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:06,898
Cha Young-min.

399
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:10,360
-What?
-You're telling me to operate on Dr. Cha?

400
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,487
Is that important?

401
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,531
What's important is the procedure.

402
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,740
What do you mean?

403
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:19,828
A doctor lost a patient
in the middle of an operation.

404
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,413
It happens.

405
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:25,417
He was trying to save the patient,
but it was beyond his control.

406
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,336
Sometimes, when a doctor is about
to operate on a patient,

407
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,589
the patient dies on the operating table
before surgery even begins.

408
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,174
Isn't that right?

409
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,761
You'll receive
a reinstatement letter soon.

410
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,930
Good luck with your return surgery.

411
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,561
Why are you telling me this here?

412
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:45,645
Why?

413
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:47,772
Because Dr. Cha might be here?

414
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,858
Who cares if he is.

415
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:53,069
What can he do?
Seung-tak is no longer around.

416
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,490
But what is that?

417
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,617
This?

418
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:01,953
It's a gift

419
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:07,042
to celebrate his reinstatement.

420
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,879
After you finish the operation,
let's celebrate with this.

421
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,466
Don't make any mistakes this time.

422
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,634
Get the deed done swiftly. Okay?

423
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,473
This is a very rare bottle.

424
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,976
-It's very rare.
-You know your champagne.

425
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,493
It's Dr. Cha's apartment.

426
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:46,873
It seems Dr. Koh goes there
from time to time.

427
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:50,168
I have a hunch
that you might find him there.

428
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:51,920
I see.

429
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:55,507
If you see him,
can you tell him we need to talk?

430
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,259
I have something I need to ask.

431
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,477
Excuse me.

432
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,463
What are you doing here?

433
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,842
-How did you find this place?
-I came to get you.

434
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,510
Let's go while I'm being nice.

435
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,066
Why aren't you coming?

436
00:28:57,318 --> 00:29:00,321
Just wear anything.
I'm busy because I'm an intern.

437
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,452
Dr. Jang told you?

438
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:06,453
Or Nurse Jung?

439
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:07,662
It was Dr. Jang.

440
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:11,207
She told me to beat you silly
and bring you back if you refused.

441
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,127
How did she know I have a wicked punch?

442
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:19,007
I heard everything was taken care of.
All that is left is for me to leave.

443
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,093
My resignation letter
is in the living room.

444
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,721
Could you hand it in for me?

445
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,766
They keep calling me. It's so annoying.

446
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,936
This looks all right.

447
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,980
Doesn't fit right.

448
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,859
You made my heart flutter.

449
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:38,860
Did you know that?

450
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:41,279
What?

451
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,615
When you ran around in your white gown.

452
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,742
When you jumped up in joy
after saving a patient.

453
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,660
You looked so charming.

454
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,205
My heart raced whenever I was around you.

455
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,918
My grandpa would've been proud of you.

456
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,378
That also occurred to me.

457
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,881
Your grandpa? That's so random.

458
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,466
I've never met him.

459
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,426
He passed away.

460
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,637
Yes, 20 years ago.

461
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,430
Before he died,

462
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:10,225
he saved a young boy's life.

463
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,102
That's why I'm so upset.

464
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,355
That boy is giving me problems.

465
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,316
What are you talking about?

466
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,485
I need to go out.

467
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,446
Take a nap here
before you head back to work.

468
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,489
Bye.

469
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,494
You know Dr. Cha's
operation has been delayed.

470
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,412
Dr. Cha is probably waiting for you.

471
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,914
You would know that.

472
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,916
There are other doctors who can do it.

473
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,501
They'll handle it.

474
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,504
Dr. Jang wants to talk to you.

475
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,298
She has something important to ask you.

476
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:46,719
Well, I don't think
we'll be seeing each other anymore.

477
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:54,602
I just told you my feelings. You jerk.

478
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:57,146
Maybe I should've beat him.

479
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,648
Are you crazy?

480
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,191
You want me to do what?

481
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,526
I don't have much time.

482
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:04,279
You're crazy. This is too reckless.

483
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,655
What do you take me for?

484
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:09,117
I'm a ghost that follows the principles.

485
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,536
You intervened and saved Seung-jo.

486
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:13,872
How is that the same?

487
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:14,873
And Hoon-gil too.

488
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,708
I said I won't do it.
Stop being so stubborn?

489
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:17,792
Then why did you

490
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,881
-come to the operating room that day?
-What?

491
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:32,015
What are you doing? Grab the clamp!

492
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:35,476
You always argue over small details.

493
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,437
If you had come sooner,

494
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,731
could we have saved the patient?

495
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,400
What are you saying?

496
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:46,195
I can't do an operation.
I only picked up a few tricks.

497
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,949
Why did you possess my body back then?

498
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,618
12 years ago, on that day.

499
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:56,247
And you did it several
more times to save patients.

500
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,957
You're a doctor. A heart surgeon.

501
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,043
A very skilled surgeon, too.

502
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,586
You owe me a big favor.

503
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,005
It doesn't work that way.

504
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,341
Isn't it the other way around?

505
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,763
I'm having surgery soon.

506
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,932
When they wheel me in,

507
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:15,600
I'll die.

508
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,394
If you're not careful,

509
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:22,273
you can die before your body
enters the operating unit.

510
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:26,027
This time,

511
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:27,904
please get involved

512
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,365
in saving my life.

513
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,784
Doctor.

514
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,663
Seung-tak.

515
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,415
Mom.

516
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,584
I worried you, I think.

517
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,877
Of course, you did.

518
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,964
I was so worried about you
these past few days.

519
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,052
That's why I came.

520
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,720
I didn't want to hurt you.

521
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,139
Let's have a look at you.

522
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,767
Are you eating three meals a day?

523
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,728
I hardly ever skip a meal, Mom.

524
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,481
You know I like fine dining.

525
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:05,233
Why won't you come home?

526
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,651
Where are you staying?

527
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:07,944
A secret hideout.

528
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,320
Don't tell grandpa.

529
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,322
Grandpa is worried a lot.

530
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:16,744
You know how he never shows his emotions

531
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,747
but he cares for and loves you a lot.

532
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,047
I know.

533
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:31,843
You had a difficult time mediating
between Grandpa and me,

534
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:35,430
taking my side
as he rarely showed his emotions.

535
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:41,519
I didn't like that.
But I caused another situation.

536
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,773
Mom, I have something to tell you.

537
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,859
I'm hungry.

538
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,528
Can we order first?

539
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,046
Don't be too surprised.

540
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,298
Don't cry a lot.

541
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,009
I'm okay.

542
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,386
I'll be fine.

543
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,806
I'm not doing this to die.

544
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:20,892
I'm trying to live.

545
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,311
And I'll go to you then.

546
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,818
-Yes?
-We need you at ER.

547
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:31,903
Okay.

548
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:49,295
What is he trying to do?
He really is reckless.

549
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:54,175
I don't care anymore.

550
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,347
The food is great.

551
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,932
Let's come here again, Seung-tak.

552
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:06,938
Mom.

553
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,027
I recall that one time…

554
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,447
I think you were about ten.

555
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:22,787
You came downstairs with a big smile.

556
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:26,624
"Mom, I'm hungry. Where's breakfast?"

557
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,543
After saying that…

558
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:33,464
"it's so good. Make this again for me."

559
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,091
I remember that time.

560
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,054
It was that day

561
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,181
when you began

562
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,725
to pretend everything was okay.

563
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:48,396
You would laugh louder and acted silly.

564
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:51,357
You made an effort
to act like a spoiled rich kid.

565
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,990
I know it was because of me.

566
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,325
You felt guilty

567
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,786
for taking away dad from me.

568
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,915
So you were trying to cheer me up.

569
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:13,337
You gave me a lot of happy moments

570
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,674
and sad moments.

571
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,509
You were forcing yourself

572
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,095
to act like that.

573
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,933
I know you're not interested
in managing the hospital.

574
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,937
But you worked at the hospital
because you think

575
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,899
that I took this position
in place of your father

576
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,859
and want to pass this down to you.

577
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:40,823
But Seung-tak.

578
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,326
You don't have to force yourself.

579
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,536
Don't do it for my sake.

580
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,996
Pursue what you want.

581
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,541
Live the life you want.

582
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,337
That'll make me happier.

583
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,685
We don't have any patients
with brain injuries.

584
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,230
There must have been a mistake.

585
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:17,818
Yes, Nurse Jung?

586
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,322
What?

587
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,660
What happened?

588
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,040
I think it's aspiration.

589
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,295
-We need a portable X-ray now.
-Okay.

590
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:41,259
This is VIP room 9101.
Please bring a portable chest AP fast.

591
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:44,595
I came right away after getting your call.

592
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,347
The bed was flat when I got here.

593
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,099
I thought that was strange,
so I raised the height.

594
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,850
Why was it like that?

595
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,394
I had the height raised.

596
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,074
MISSED CALL
MOM, JAE-WON

597
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,201
JAE-WON

598
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:15,126
Hey, answer your phone!
Dr. Cha's condition is critical!

599
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,213
What's wrong? How is Dr. Cha?

600
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,631
Why weren't you answering?

601
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,719
Mister, take me to Eunsang University
Medical Center. Please hurry.

602
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:36,314
How could you?
Wasn't the chairman alone enough?

603
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,815
Now you're trying to kill Dr. Cha?

604
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:40,735
-What are you talking about?
-What is it now?

605
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,112
You're worried
that Dr. Cha's operation will work?

606
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,032
If he wakes up,
the truth will come out, right?

607
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,658
But how could you do this?

608
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,660
You thought I didn't know?

609
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,829
Do you know why I stayed silent
despite knowing the truth?

610
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:54,290
I was afraid you'd try to harm Dr. Cha.

611
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,500
Because I'm trying to save him.

612
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,294
To wake him up from his coma.

613
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:03,591
Listen carefully.

614
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,177
If anything happens to Young-min,

615
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:08,929
I'm going to come after you.

616
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,057
Tell my half-brother this.

617
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:14,143
If he tries something like this again,

618
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:17,355
I'll follow him to the depths of hell

619
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,023
and end him.

620
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,108
Understand?

621
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,290
You came? Seung-tak.

622
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,669
Do I have to risk my life to meet you?

623
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:43,964
What's that?

624
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,800
I recognize that jacket.

625
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,928
Are you worried I might be dead?

626
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,514
As you can see.

627
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,851
Are you crazy?

628
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:59,146
How could you do that to yourself?
You could've died.

629
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:04,360
You gave me no choice. Without you around,
there was nothing I could do here.

630
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:08,656
And that tone again. You punk.

631
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,825
That day,

632
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:13,369
we couldn't have saved him
even if everything went right.

633
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:14,829
You didn't know it

634
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,997
but the aorta burst
before you opened his chest.

635
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,543
It was too late. It's not your fault. So…

636
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,002
That could have been you.

637
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,712
I could have killed you.

638
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,714
What if that happens again? You would die.

639
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,176
I'm a bad judge of character.

640
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,139
I thought I could make you
a skilled surgeon by mentoring you.

641
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,223
I guess not.

642
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:35,641
After leaving that day,

643
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,227
was that all you thought about?

644
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,730
Instead of thinking about improving
your skill to save lives,

645
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:44,525
you were worried
that it would happen again?

646
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:45,443
Doctor.

647
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:49,864
Doctors don't always leave
an operating room with a big smile.

648
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,657
You think they'll say,

649
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:55,327
"The operation was a success.
Don't worry."

650
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,121
Is that what you think?

651
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,290
Doctors aren't gods.

652
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,208
Because they aren't,

653
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,503
they just try their best.

654
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:06,755
Hoping that they'll save

655
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,384
more lives than lose them.

656
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,429
That's the only hope they have.

657
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,556
Gosh.

658
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,602
Will you do this again?

659
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,437
Become miserable with grief

660
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,231
and hole yourself inside and cry?

661
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:27,276
Quit being a doctor
if that's how you'll act.

662
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,570
You don't have the qualification
to be a doctor.

663
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:30,863
The hand mask.

664
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,656
The one I gave you. Give it back.

665
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,325
Who says I'll be a doctor?

666
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,621
You don't get to judge me.

667
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,790
You entered my body and made a big mess.

668
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,918
You won't remember any of this
when you wake up.

669
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,878
Why did this have to happen to me?

670
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:48,589
What did I do to deserve this?

671
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,341
You regret it?

672
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:51,634
Or…

673
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,427
are you sick of me?

674
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:56,931
You said you'd hang in there
till I wake up.

675
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,307
Yes, I'm sick and tired.

676
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,519
I'm sick of the hospital,
the patients and being possessed.

677
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:05,439
I'm tired of trying to figure out what
to do in life and what career to pursue.

678
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,982
It annoys the hell out of me!

679
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,652
I want this to end.

680
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,862
I just want to live a normal life.

681
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,629
He came when he heard the news

682
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:32,091
and you risked your life
to bring him back.

683
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,551
But still,

684
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:36,262
why did you have to talk tough?

685
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,764
Why couldn't you be supportive?

686
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:41,892
You told me to make sure
he didn't do that again.

687
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,770
Since when did you ever listen to me?

688
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,274
That day…

689
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:51,569
Why did you possess my body 12 years ago?

690
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,780
I already told you.

691
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,324
Because you had the same look

692
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,410
-he had on his face.
-Stop!

693
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:04,790
This is a hospital and we're doctors.

694
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:06,375
If we give up on our patients…

695
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,588
I was moved by your expression.

696
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:13,257
Are you both nine-tailed foxes or what?

697
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,258
I know, right?

698
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:16,677
That's why I'm going to
place my bet on him.

699
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,180
He's contemplating.
I put some sense into him.

700
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,768
So that's your takeaway?

701
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,478
You're totally infatuated.

702
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:36,113
Our timing and angle
were perfectly timed, right?

703
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,742
This isn't an operation.

704
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:42,494
You're lucky the nurse found you quickly.

705
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,790
I can't predict what'll happen from here.

706
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,126
It's my first time, too.

707
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:53,631
My principle
is to avoid possessing evil men.

708
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:56,800
I possessed a piece of trash.

709
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,511
Wipe that smile off your face.

710
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:02,973
What bad luck!

711
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,553
Where are you right now?

712
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:49,186
I thought all that was left
was his surgery, after which he'd wake up.

713
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,314
What now, Doctor?

714
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,525
It's my fault.

715
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,611
If I hadn't left his side…

716
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:01,615
I'm to blame.

717
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,222
Don't skip your meals!

718
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:27,433
You better keep your phone
on at all times.

719
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:33,605
Dr. Cha didn't advance to sepsis.
He had aspiration pneumonia.

720
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:37,067
After two weeks of antibiotics,
they'll have to wait and see.

721
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,195
His operation has been delayed
until he recovers.

722
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,279
Sorry.

723
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,615
I'm so sorry.

724
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:08,617
But Se-jin,

725
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,785
I'm a doctor.

726
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,996
I see a critical patient before me

727
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,833
and I can't do anything.
That drives me crazy.

728
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:18,961
I had to try something.

729
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,797
I want to save his life.

730
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:25,801
I'm not going to let him die.

731
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,804
I'll save him no matter what.

732
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:32,975
And send him back to you.

733
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,227
I promise.

734
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,089
Hey, Seung-tak. Do something.

735
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:05,882
Otherwise, the patient will die.

736
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:20,647
Doctors aren't gods.

737
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,191
Because they aren't,

738
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:25,569
they just

739
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:27,779
try their best.

740
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:32,909
Hoping that they'll save more lives
than lose them.

741
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,704
That's the only hope they have.

742
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,151
EUNSANG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

743
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,083
JAE-WON

744
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:24,711
What? Did something happen to Dr. Cha?

745
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,296
Yes.

746
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,799
They're transferring him
to another hospital.

747
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:29,716
What?

748
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,719
Dr. Jang wants to transfer Dr. Cha
to another hospital

749
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:33,929
so that he can get surgery.

750
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,683
I think what happened yesterday
shocked her.

751
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,477
Dr. Ban isn't in his office right now.

752
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,563
-Please discuss this with him.
-No, that's not necessary.

753
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,775
I've waited long enough.
I can't entrust him here.

754
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:50,070
Please find a suitable hospital
where he can be moved.

755
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,697
But Doctor…

756
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,532
Do I have to find one myself?

757
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:02,082
Does Dr. Cha also know?

758
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,750
What? Who?

759
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,464
What are you saying?

760
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:10,799
What if Dr. Cha knows?

761
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,552
What's wrong?
Did it get caught in your throat?

762
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:15,470
Oh my, Ji-min.

763
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,181
-Son! What's wrong?
-What's wrong with him?

764
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:20,559
Help. I need help.

765
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,271
I think you need to call a paramedic.

766
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:28,024
-Call for help.
-Please call 911.

767
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,280
We're at an intersection.

768
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,489
What's wrong, Ji-min?

769
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,910
Please help my son. Please help.

770
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,746
Wake up, Ji-min. Oh my gosh.

771
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:44,082
Please help. Wake up, Ji-min.

772
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:45,000
Dr. Ban?

773
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,635
Does your son have asthma?

774
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:56,970
Yes, he does.

775
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:00,015
A peanut got lodged in his throat.
But we just got it out.

776
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:02,559
He seemed okay
but after taking a few steps,

777
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,478
he wheezed and suddenly collapsed.

778
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:07,397
That irritated his throat.
His airway has been sealed.

779
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:11,193
What should I do?
Should I take him to a hospital?

780
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:12,402
He won't last till then.

781
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:15,530
Hold on.

I'll just take five minutes.

784
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,584
Seung-tak, stay by this boy's side.

785
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,044
Don't let Dr. Ban go anywhere.

786
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:30,128
It's you?

787
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:46,144
What? Where am I?

788
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,396
What are you saying?

789
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:50,816

PHARMACY

00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,917
What just happened here?

792
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:11,962
Move it.

793
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:15,757
What is this?

794
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:26,184
-Take off your scarf. I need it.
-Okay.

795
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,368
Seung-tak, turn on your flashlight.

796
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:45,078
-Point it here.
-Okay.

797
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:51,960
Can he use that?

798
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:11,313
Are you okay, Ji-min?

799
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:13,398
It's Mommy. Are you okay, Ji-min?

800
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:16,151
-He's awake.
-He's alive.

801
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:17,277
What a relief.

What's the situation?

804
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:34,044
The boy has asthma.

805
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:36,379
He had an asthma attack

806
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,924
after a piece of food got lodged
in his throat.

807
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:42,594
I've cleared his airway
so take him to a hospital.

808
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:44,721
Give him steroid treatment.

809
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,181
Are you a doctor?

00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,225
How did you know that?

811
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:50,310
What's happening?

812
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,479
Why am I blacking out?

813
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,522
What's happening to my mind?

814
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:56,483
Excuse me. Who are you?

815
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:04,407
I've completed the discharge paperwork.

816
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:06,785
When will we move him?

817
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:10,205
Hold on a sec.

818
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,668
Who are you?

819
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:26,471
What is this? What are you doing here?

820
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,307
I heard you're transferring him.

821
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:32,435
Did Dr. Cha agree to this?

822
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,813
Stop talking nonsense. Get out of here.

823
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:37,983
Did you not hear me?

824
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:41,778
You must not know yet.

825
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,489
Or…

826
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:46,491
are you hiding it from me?

827
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,911
What are you talking about?

828
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:55,583
It was hard to keep up with you.

829
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:58,962
I think Dr. Ban is getting old.

830
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,797
How could he have no leg strength?

831
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,050
I wonder how he does surgery for hours?

832
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:06,803
Were you a doctor?

833
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:10,181
Why didn't you go inside

834
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,475
after you came all the way
to the hospital?

835
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,437
You made me wait outside in the cold.

836
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:17,564
It's freezing.

837
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:19,691
Is your last name "Oh?"

838
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:22,277
Since we're here,

839
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,196
how about we go buy some spring suits?

840
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,240
Could we visit a men's store nearby?

841
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:29,325
Could you buy me a few suits?

842
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:32,454
You have a granddaughter who's my age?

843
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:34,622
Of course.

844
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:36,624
She's the prettiest person in the world.

845
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,168
Soo-jung.

846
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:55,643
-How are the boy's vitals?
-Dr. Ban.

847
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:58,521
What are you doing in there?

848
00:55:58,605 --> 00:55:59,606
I don’t know.

849
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:03,193
I'm wondering how I got here, too.

850
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:06,738
It's just like that day.

851
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:09,157
That day, 20 years ago.

852
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:11,326
Like that day.

853
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:12,744
Was it you?

854
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:17,040
Did you save my life 20 years ago?

855
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,462
That little boy

856
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:25,173
is all grown up now.

857
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:30,345
Seung-tak.

858
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,139
Time flies, doesn't it?

859
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:45,485
-Doctor, we have the ambulance ready.
-Okay.

860
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:51,991
Take your hands off of the patient.

861
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:55,286
-Dr. Koh.
-You want to transfer to another hospital?

862
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,289
What took you so long, you punk?

863
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:00,083
It was such a long wait.

864
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:02,252
You're still sticking
with your judgment of me?

865
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:05,088
-Of course.
-Okay. Then stay here.

866
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:06,923
With me.

867
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:11,094
Right here.

868
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:26,067
20 YEARS AGO

869
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:38,079
Cut.

870
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:44,002
Dr. Oh, you're amazing.

871
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:46,296
You were perfect.

872
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:48,631
Good job.

873
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:49,799
By the way…

874
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,510
Dr. Ban.

875
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,888
-Yes?
-When you have time,

876
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,432
come observe my surgeries.

877
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:02,770
You'll improve your skills
by learning the areas

878
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:04,314
in which you lack expertise.

879
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:08,902
Thank you, Doctor.
I'll try my best to learn.

880
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:13,865
Are you not feeling well?

881
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,242
No.

882
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:19,496
I'll stay by the patient's side.
So please turn in.

883
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,831
-You didn't go home yesterday either.
-No.

884
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:25,293
I have to stay until the patient wakes up.

885
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:39,307
My little princess.

886
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:41,684
Yes.

887
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:45,855
I'll go home after I see a patient.

888
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:46,856
What?

889
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,526
You…

890
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:52,654
You're going to stay up and wait?

891
00:58:56,115 --> 00:59:00,245
Of course. I bought you a chocolate cake

892
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:04,666
that you like, Princess.

893
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:09,587
Do an ABGA an hour later.
Call me if anything looks abnormal.

894
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:11,089
Okay.

895
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:17,929
Hello? We don't have a surgeon available.
Could you take him to another hospital?

896
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,180
What kind of patient?

897
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:21,182
Hold on.

898
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:24,269
A patient with a descending
aortic aneurysm and impending rupture.

899
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:27,063
Even if his vitals are stable,
he might not make it

900
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,940
because it's an impending rupture case.

901
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:31,359
I'll go down.

902
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:32,860
Accept the patient.

903
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:35,238
And call anesthesiology. Get a room ready.

904
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:36,864
Okay, Doctor.

905
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:38,241
Send him our way.

906
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:49,252
Do you believe in God?

907
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:55,216
Even if you don’t believe
in a higher power, there'll come a time

908
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,760
when you'll pray to God
in a desperate situation.

909
00:59:58,344 --> 00:59:59,387
And in those times,

910
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,890
we, doctors, will handle it.

911
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:06,269
So how can a doctor ignore a patient?

912
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,606
You can't rely on a spirit to help.

913
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:11,065
Everything depends on us

914
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:15,361
since we're the ones alive.

915
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:40,178
It's gotten late.

916
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:49,812
She cried and tried to stay awake
until you got home.

917
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:51,439
She's asleep now, Father.

918
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,611
I'm late again.

919
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:33,481
Grandpa broke his promise again.

920
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:11,185
Doctor.

921
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,065
Oh, dear.

922
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:18,192
He's done another night shift.

923
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:22,071
Doctor.

924
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:23,990
Are you asleep?

925
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:12,121
Did you check the test results
for the patient with chest pain?

926
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,164
Not yet.

927
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:14,248
Be on your toes, punk.

928
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:15,625
What if he has a myocardial infarction?

929
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:17,460
-That's careless.
-Okay.

930
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:31,974
Thanks for waiting for me.

931
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:37,230
Let's go now.

932
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:42,527
This way.

933
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:45,822
Lift him.

934
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:47,824
One, two, three.

935
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:49,784
Get the EKG attached. Hurry.

936
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:53,996
Pump the Ambu bag.

937
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,456
This way.

938
01:03:57,792 --> 01:04:01,170
Hurry. Lift him. One, two, three.

939
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:05,925
Seung-tak.

940
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:07,218
Seung-tak, wake up.

941
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:11,389
Attach the EKG.

942
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:17,228
Hong-joo, intubation.

943
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:26,779
Dad!

944
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:29,240
Dad!

945
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:31,742
Dad!

946
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:33,995
Dad!

947
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:36,080
Dad!

948
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:37,915
Dad!

949
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:42,837
The moment you call out for God.

950
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:47,675
And the moment you'd wish
a ghost could come and help

951
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:49,468
if God is too busy.

952
01:04:57,518 --> 01:04:58,853
Dad?

953
01:05:08,654 --> 01:05:11,282
If the living could fix everything…

954
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,540
Only if they could…

955
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:06,003
Do you know what time it is?
You're late on your first day.

956
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:07,505
Don't try anything against Dr. Cha.

957
01:06:07,588 --> 01:06:08,464
He's my mentor now.

958
01:06:08,547 --> 01:06:10,466
-Master.
-Yes.

959
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:12,760
I want to save these patients.

960
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:15,137
It's a cardiac arrest. Start CPR.

961
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:18,641
To master this,
go back to learning the basics.

962
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:21,644
No, not like that. Work on it all night.

963
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:23,062
Did you have lunch?

964
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:24,772
-This is strange.
-Something is strange.

965
01:06:24,855 --> 01:06:26,107
Time to get even.

966
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:28,234
Watch out, Dr. Koh!

967
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:30,403
No…

968
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:38,077
