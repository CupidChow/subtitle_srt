1
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:35,660
Oh, gosh.

2
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,871
How is this possible?

3
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,873
Isn't he a first-year?

4
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:43,042
-How did he pull it off?
-I've been a doctor for 25 years

5
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,211
since I started as an intern.

6
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,046
This can only happen

7
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:51,634
either if he's possessed by a spirit
or we've been hypnotized by one.

8
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,222
I know what you're saying.

9
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,641
I remember now. It happened once before.

10
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,895
When Dr. Cha was an intern.

11
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,939
I was in the operating room with him.

12
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,733
That's right.

13
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,109
You were there.

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,706
Do you always get giddy
after an operation?

15
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:23,583
What?

16
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:27,712
I've never seen you like this before.
It's surprising.

17
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,422
No, I'm not.

18
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,300
You're acting like
you're on top of the world.

19
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,512
Don't exaggerate.

20
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,641
It's just been a while
since I've operated.

21
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,726
What about you? You went wild with joy.

22
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,273
It was quite an experience.

23
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,192
This must be why people become doctors.

24
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:53,238
As if. You didn't lift a finger though.

25
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,373
Then how does it really feel?

26
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,671
Oh, gosh.

27
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,215
What do you mean?

28
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,593
To save someone's life.

29
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,558
Well…

30
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,730
You feel like you've got the magic touch.

31
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,608
The technique…

32
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,112
is in your hands.

33
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:38,741
Chefs with the magic touch
create delicious dishes.

34
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,870
A good painter makes good art.

35
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,498
And doctors save patients.

36
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,542
Having the magic touch.

37
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,253
Being on the top of the world.

38
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,797
There's nothing to it.

39
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:57,719
To a doctor, saving lives

40
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,806
is the most gratifying experience ever.

41
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:09,022
If you want to know how it feels,
then start performing surgery.

42
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,859
If I start doing surgery,

43
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,946
will you let me operate on you?

44
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,448
What?

45
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,159
Don't be scared.

46
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,120
Don’t worry. That won't happen.

47
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:26,623
Well…

48
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,792
I'm not going to be a doctor
for long anyway.

49
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,840
I'm so sleepy and hungry.

50
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,385
You did a 12-hour surgery.
Of course, you're tired.

51
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,012
12 hours?

52
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,975
Why didn't you tell me
that it would take this long?

53
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,144
And if I did, wouldn't you have done it?

54
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,230
I would've eaten a big meal beforehand.

55
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,190
How can you operate for 12 hours?

56
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,025
Is that even possible?

57
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,902
That's what doctors do.

58
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:59,447
And you need to build up
your stamina and strength.

59
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,949
You're so weak.

60
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,158
Do some squats.

61
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,247
They wrote a glowing article
for the two-hour operation I did.

62
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,581
But this one was 12 hours.

63
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,752
This will be in the papers tomorrow.

64
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,338
Don't count on that. Don't worry.

65
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,841
I know Dr. Ban very well.

66
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:22,095
Just wait and see. This will work.

67
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,682
Why did you agree to do this surgery
when you couldn't handle it?

68
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,558
We were lucky
that Seung-tak pulled through.

69
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,018
Were you trying to kill the patient?

70
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,022
-I'm sorry.
-It's not just about the patient.

71
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,066
You could've ruined my career, too.

72
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,027
Now listen carefully.

73
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,363
You were the lead surgeon
for this operation.

74
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,073
Doctor.

75
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,075
Don't you remember what Seung-tak said?

76
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,911
Dr. Ahn.

77
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,498
I'll let you take it from here.

78
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,347
Let's return to our places.

79
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,640
Let me take that spot.

80
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,352
What?

81
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,397
You're the lead surgeon
for this operation.

82
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,567
I was just your first assistant.

83
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,322
Isn't that correct, Dr. Ban?

84
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,658
Is that so?

85
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,201
Yes, sure.

86
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,086
There's no harm to you, Dr. Ahn.

87
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,339
The operation was a success
and you'll get the credit.

88
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,425
Isn't this even better?

89
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,181
Anyway, he's like
no other genius I've ever seen.

90
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,433
He had to have been possessed.

91
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,018
Possessed?

92
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,939
There's no such thing as ghosts.

93
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,070
I'm lucky that you're a ghost doctor.

94
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,739
If you were the Jade Emperor
or a baby shaman, I'd be in trouble.

95
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,574
That's a bad analogy.

96
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,659
Or any other kind of ghost
for that matter.

97
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,536
Or even a demonic spirit.

98
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,288
Show some respect, will you?

99
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,543
Instead of you, I wish
I could've possessed Dr. Kim's body.

100
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,795
At least he's nice.

101
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,348
Tess!

102
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,726
Why am I able to possess his body?

103
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,025
Why isn't it working?

104
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,819
How come he can possess him, but not us?

105
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,904
This is discrimination.

106
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,783
Hey!

107
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,034
Hold on a second!

108
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,119
Am I not your first?

109
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,620
Are you sure it works only on me?

110
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,205
-You know something I don't, right?
-Are you on to something?

111
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,332
-What's your religion? I'm an atheist.
-What's your blood type? I'm Type O.

112
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,459
Hey, what's your astrological sign?

113
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,044
-I'm a Scorpio.
-Where were you born?

114
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,045
I was born in Seoul. In a clinic.

115
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,421
Me, too.

116
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,718
This is pointless.

117
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,138
It's no use.

118
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,057
You have it better than me though.

119
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,601
At least you can see me.

120
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:17,812
And you know who I am.

121
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,814
You even cut a deal with me.

122
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,066
And you can summon me
whenever you need me.

123
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:26,028
Why did I get stuck
with an insolent prick like you?

124
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,199
How did we end up like this?

125
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:33,911
There…

126
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,330
has to be a reason.

127
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,294
Whether it's our past lives

128
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,047
or the will of the Heavens…

129
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,387
There's no harm to you, Dr. Ahn.

130
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,140
Isn't this even better?

131
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,484
Yes, Administrative Director?

132
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,944
Looks like the surgery is over
since you answered.

133
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,404
How did it go?

134
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,576
The operation was a success.

135
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,204
And the patient is stable.

136
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,831
Really?

137
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,417
You're very skilled, Dr. Ahn.

138
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,794
I should treat you better.

139
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,430
And he's lucky too.

140
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,858
Why are you so late?

141
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,735
You're always acting busy.

142
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,071
Koreans are the busiest people
in the world.

143
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,490
Don't put on airs
just because you've been abroad.

144
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,075
What about the thing I asked for?

145
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,368
Any news in the States?

146
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,846
Seung-tak did another operation today.

147
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,472
He was really happy.

148
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,350
As if he was on the top of the world.

149
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:07,189
He says that's what motivates doctors.
What a joke.

150
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,735
He hardly did anything
in the operating room.

151
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,744
The technique is all in the hands.

152
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,726
He asked if I would let him operate on me.

153
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,105
He can't even hold a scalpel.

154
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,860
How could he save a patient

155
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,112
who's going to die?

156
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,296
EUNSANG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

157
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,714
Is that true?

158
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,468
That Dr. Ahn successfully operated
on Oh Seung-jo?

159
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:21,680
Yes, sure. Dr. Ahn did a great job.

160
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,349
You know he's an excellent surgeon.

161
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,726
I heard people say
Seung-tak did the surgery.

162
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,686
-Who said that?
-Dr. Oh. Anesthesiology.

163
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,730
He's got such a big mouth.

164
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,650
Now listen. Dr. Ahn was the lead surgeon.

165
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,361
Seung-tak was the first assistant.
He only helped.

166
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,862
Understand that?

167
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,324
-First assistant?
-He only helped I see.

168
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,700
I see.

169
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,953
Since you all do,
I've got something to discuss.

170
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,997
About Dr. Cha's other patients…

171
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:50,042
Do we need to transfer them all
to other hospitals?

172
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,128
We don't need to.

173
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,047
The Cardiovascular Dept.
has been at a standstill.

174
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,050
We've got talented doctors
in our department.

175
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,428
I could also lend a hand
and have other doctors help.

176
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,391
Draw up a surgery schedule
and hand it in before the conference.

177
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:08,811
If you mention Oh's surgery,
I'll sew your mouth

178
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,232
with a needle and string.

179
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,404
DR. BAN

180
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:22,908
DR. KIM

181
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,745
DR. JUNG

182
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,334
MOM

183
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,048
Yes, Mom?

184
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,551
Me?

185
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,095
I'm in the night duty room.

186
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,600
No, I didn't do the surgery myself.

187
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:49,977
I'm not a genius.

188
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,064
So there's no need for a celebration.

189
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,233
I love you.

190
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,154
Seung-tak?

191
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,739
Did you hang up?

192
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,034
Gosh, my little one.

193
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,785
He must be tired.

194
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,207
But he did say "I love you"
before he hung up.

195
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:16,337
I shouldn't be sitting around like this.

196
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,718
I'm in the night duty room?

197
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,140
What? What am I doing here?

198
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,437
I slept for 12 hours?

199
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,618
Why do I ache all over?

200
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,413
Did I sleep too much?

201
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,125
Why does my shoulder hurt?

202
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,509
Why are so many people calling?

203
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,355
He still hasn't woken up yet?

204
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:19,358
What? You left after he woke up, Doctor.

205
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,568
I did?

206
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,279
You were at his side all night.

207
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:24,989
I was?

208
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,866
Are you half-asleep?

209
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,201
You should get more sleep.
Why did you come back so early?

210
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,036
You left two hours ago.

211
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,706
Just two hours?

212
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,166
How is your shoulder?

213
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,210
My shoulder?

214
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,132
I said I'd call you when he woke up,

215
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:46,218
but you said you had to stay
by the patient's side until he woke up.

216
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,511
You sat next to him all night.

217
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,696
You're awake? Can you see?
Do you recognize me?

218
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,413
I'm proud of you, Seung-jo.

219
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,290
Good job.

220
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,378
You were so happy to see the patient
when he woke.

221
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,591
Then you gave us an order before leaving.

222
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,302
You don't remember that?

223
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,860
Has he matured a bit
after turning into a ghost?

224
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,820
He's so different.

225
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,367
But why did he stay up alone?

226
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,701
I'm also Seung-jo's doctor.

227
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,829
And why did he fall off the chair?

228
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,247
This isn't his body.

229
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,207
That doctor…

230
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,833
Did you make her cry?

231
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,919
How could I?

232
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,004
No, I didn't.

233
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,047
Then…

234
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,217
why is she so sad?

235
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,514
I wonder how she's taking her meals.

236
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,353
As a ghost, I don't need to eat.

237
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,022
Not you. I'm talking about her.

238
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,776
Well, that…

239
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,196
I haven't been checking. Sorry.

240
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,867
Are you leaving soon?

241
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,535
What?

242
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:19,038
Se-jin is returning to America?

243
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,040
Not her. I meant you.

244
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,127
Though I'm her dad,

245
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,672
I didn't get to know her
until she became an adult.

246
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,632
But…

247
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,887
I've seen that expression before.

248
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,806
The day she left the country 12 years ago.

249
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:42,144
She looked kept looking behind her
as she was catching her flight.

250
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,856
That was the expression she had.

251
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:53,197
Will you be the one
to leave her behind this time?

252
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,375
What are you doing?

253
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,004
We're sorry, sir.

254
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:09,922
We're sorry.

255
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,800
Good morning!

256
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,635
You don't have to holler.

257
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:16,804
Wait.

258
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,389
You have something on your suit.

259
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:21,767
There you go.

260
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,227
Hold on a minute.

261
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,647
Your necklace is crooked.

262
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,903
What's gotten into them?

263
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,839
Where did you hide it?

264
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,305
Where…

265
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,642
did you send Mr. Lim?

266
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,478
How could you do this to me?

267
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,856
Even on your deathbed, you're screwing me.

268
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,626
Chairman Jang.

269
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,004
Do you want to stay like that forever?

270
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,511
You don't, right?

271
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:44,850
I don't feel good either,
having to keep you in a vegetative state.

272
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:50,189
I'm losing sleep these days.
I can't get relax at all.

273
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,858
And I get irritable
when I don't sleep well.

274
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,318
It's like a neurotic disorder.

275
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,360
Do you have to

276
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,155
keep making me do these things?
I don't want to be bad.

277
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,157
Why are you pushing me into a corner?

278
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,075
I wish I could beat him up.

279
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,328
I wish I could throw him out the window.

280
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,247
I need a body massage.

281
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,336
Where are you?

282
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:18,217
I thought I had time to play Go.
Guess not anymore.

283
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:24,389
Looks like I'll die sooner than you.

284
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,207
I'll go now.

285
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,502
Dad.

286
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,380
The will.

287
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:02,427
Before his surgery, he called our lawyer
and changed his will.

288
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,765
That old man!
He knew how things would unfold.

289
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:10,769
He's so prescient. What a clever old man.

290
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,771
He didn't trust you till the end I see.

291
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,815
You haven't seen the will?

292
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:16,108
If I had, I wouldn't…

293
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:19,945
How is this just my problem?

294
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,114
You need allies
to take control of the hospital.

295
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:25,242
I have to become the chairman
in order to make a big investment.

296
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,493
Hey.

297
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,412
Lower your voice.

298
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,706
We're at a hospital.

299
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,298
I'm buying as much time
as possible for you.

300
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:42,843
You said you'd inherit your dad's fortune
without a doubt.

301
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,345
Your dad's life is worth a lot,

302
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,015
but I offered my services at a low fee.

303
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,101
The longer it takes,
your interest keeps compounding.

304
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,938
You know that, right?

305
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,607
I'm trying my best,

306
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:03,822
but the executive board won't budge
until they see my dad.

307
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,752
Could you track a phone for me?

308
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,046
What's the name of the lawyer?

309
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,299
It's because of me.

310
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,970
I made her leave the country.

311
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:39,983
To make up for lost time,
I decided to help her career

312
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,736
but that only caused her pain.

313
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:47,574
I don't want to cause her
any further pain.

314
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:54,372
Can you stay by Se-jin's side?

315
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,130
I told you not to skip your meals.

316
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,716
Why don't you ever listen?

317
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,515
I can't remind you all the time.

318
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,065
Was this Dr. Cha's life as a surgeon?

319
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,609
This is grueling.

320
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:23,944
Hey Seung-tak. Come here.

321
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,407
What? Is there another article?

322
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,909
An article? What article?

323
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:33,620
Hey, what's that?

324
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,706
I have to talk a lot on the phone.

325
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,666
With whom?

326
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,752
Is that how you communicate with spirits?

327
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:41,837
What?

328
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,714
I know your secret.

329
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:45,632
I figured it out.

330
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:47,968
Figure out what?

331
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,388
Even if you're like
Matt Damon's Jason Bourne,

332
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,559
a doctor can't be that good
without hands-on experience.

333
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,436
No short amount of training
could make you that good.

334
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:00,814
It's true, right?

335
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,315
That you've been possessed.

336
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:08,321
Dr. Cha. You know his story, don't you?

337
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,699
Dr. Cha operated all on his own
when he was just an intern.

338
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:15,287
Dr. Oh told me
that it was an incredible feat.

339
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,913
Everyone said he was possessed.

340
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:19,791
What?

341
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,585
It was a complicated surgery, too.

342
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,213
How could an intern do it?

343
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,965
It doesn't make sense for you,
a first-year, to pull it off.

344
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,550
But he was an intern.

345
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,678
I was wondering if you knew anything.

346
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,139
The similarities are striking.

347
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,439
Afterward, Dr. Cha continued
to perform excellently,

348
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:43,732
so the rumors died down.

349
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,110
But it's still a mystery.

350
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,321
Dr. Cha never explained how he did it.

351
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,614
Not even once.

352
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,991
You have it better than me though.

353
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,035
At least you can see me.

354
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,953
And you know who I am.

355
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,288
You even cut a deal with me.

356
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,624
And you can summon me
whenever you need me.

357
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:04,711
Dr. Koh.

358
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,632
Dr. Koh.

359
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,009
Move out of my way.

360
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,428
Let me dust that off.

361
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:15,472
You're marvelous.

362
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,475
I'm proud of you.
You're just like me when I was young.

363
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:20,518
-I am?
-Yes.

364
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,023
You're exactly like me.

365
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:29,486
You've done open-heart surgery,
so you need to try lung surgery.

366
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:32,364
To become a specialist,
you need a variety of experiences.

367
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:35,533
Sleeve lobectomy
is not a case you often see.

368
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,411
Nowadays, doctors are focusing
on one field.

369
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,331
Since you've done it before,
how about another CABG case?

370
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,583
Residents need to try new cases.

371
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,378
You can't develop your skills
by just doing the same procedures.

372
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,380
Mitral valve repair.

373
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:51,341
Depending on the technique,
you get different results.

374
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,218
When are you free next week?

375
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:57,472
So you're asking for…

376
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:58,473
-First assistant.
-First…

377
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:00,100
We just need you to help.

378
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,311
I see.

379
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:07,190
Then I'll have to decline.

380
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,780
I'm exhausted
after doing a 12-hour surgery.

381
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,866
The chairman of the board will be worried.

382
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:19,369
Hold it there.

383
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,792
You people are so pathetic.

384
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,711
Dr. Koh doesn't care
if the surgery is complicated.

385
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:31,047
He stresses importance
on who the patient is.

386
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,215
So Dr. Koh…

387
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,385
You know Lee Ji-woo, don't you?

388
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,430
Does Lee Ji-woo know who I am?

389
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,434
Dr. Ban, Lee Ji-woo is my patient.

390
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,811
Let me finish. You're not even that good.

391
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,273
You don't know Lee Ji-woo?
She donates a lot to charities.

392
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,066
Then instead of Lee Ji-woo, how about…

393
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,153
Yes, Mom?

394
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:54,821
What is it?

395
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,657
Grandfather said so?

396
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:01,745
He keeps asking?

397
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,544
Why is this happening?

398
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,340
Dr. Cha said this would work,
but it's only brought me more work.

399
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,050
It's not just that patient.

400
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:18,470
All of Dr. Cha's patients
won't be able to get surgery.

401
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,098
We lose one doctor
and the whole department is in crisis.

402
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,103
Seung-tak.

403
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,064
What is it now?

404
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:34,110
Did you write up Oh Seung-jo's OP record?

405
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,737
Why are you asking me to write it?

406
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,739
Shouldn't the lead surgeon do it?

407
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,498
What more do they want from me?

408
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:47,916
They're not even my patients.

409
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:49,876
Hey! Seung-tak.

410
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:51,878
I've been looking for you.

411
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,838
Let's go somewhere right now.
To a restaurant.

412
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,715
Ox bone stew, spicy beef stew,
Jeongol hot pot, soybean paste stew.

413
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,176
Something hot.
The restaurants offer take-out, right?

414
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,388
Why don't you just enter my body
like you did before?

415
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:03,765
What's that in your ear?

416
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,435
You're asking me? You think I'll tell you?

417
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,687
You punk. That tone again.

418
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,648
Why are you talking to a prick like me?

419
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,567
-When you could've picked Dr. Kim.
-Will you stop changing the subject?

420
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,361
I'm in a hurry. Let's go.

421
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,654
Are you paying for the food?

422
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:22,283
Seung-tak, I'm not asking you
to buy me a car or house.

423
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,202
You can't buy me lunch?

424
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,328
I'm no fool.

425
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,580
I even wrote your OP record for you.

426
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,082
Can't you buy lunch?

427
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,333
You've been mooching off me
too many times.

428
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:35,130
-You wrote what?
-Seung-jo's operation record.

429
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,257
I barely finished it this morning.
It was exhausting.

430
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,509
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

431
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,386
Hey Seung-tak!

432
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:42,554
Where are you going?

433
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,847
Seung-tak.

434
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,303
Yes, Brother.

435
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:26,097
Where can you see the OP records?

436
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,559
I need to check something.

437
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,227
The EMR program?

438
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,896
Yes, it's me. Seung-tak.

439
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,272
I'm in.

440
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,649
I'm not possessed or anything.

441
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:03,384
Don't you find that time-consuming?

442
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,471
The other doctors just jot down the steps.

443
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:11,601
Drawing a diagram
will make it easier to understand.

444
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,355
I guess the new doctors
will find it helpful.

445
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,941
Your signature OP records.

446
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:20,985
I'm done.

447
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,987
Go scan this.

448
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,656
PATIENT: OH SEUNG-JO

449
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,839
SURGEON PROF. CHA YOUNG-MIN

450
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,467
This can only happen

451
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:48,096
either if he's possessed by a spirit
or we've been hypnotized by one.

452
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:50,890
That can't happen.

453
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,524
You even drew a diagram.

454
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:04,487
I deleted it in the nick of time.
What if someone had seen it?

455
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,364
It's a habit of mine.

456
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:09,367
Let's be careful.
I can't do everything by myself.

457
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,535
All right.

458
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:11,619
We need a solution.

459
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:15,540
First. Next time, you have to report
every detail of what you did

460
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:16,833
while you were in my body.

461
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,711
I have to report that? You punk.

462
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:20,920
You took over while I was asleep

463
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,380
and stayed by my patient's bedside
without telling me first.

464
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:25,425
Actions or words we didn't agree upon
cannot happen anymore.

465
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,593
Don't push it.

466
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,803
Second. You can only
enter my body without permission

467
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:29,888
when the situation warrants it.

468
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,724
Only when it's necessary. And briefly.

469
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:35,977
You're afraid they might find out?

470
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,312
Afraid it'll jeopardize
getting on the board?

471
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,314
Yes. They'll find out sooner or later.

472
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,482
Let's coordinate our timing and readiness.

473
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,484
That way, we can extend this deal.
Let's aim for four years.

474
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,777
I agree too.

475
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,405
-What?
-We agree, right?

476
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:48,740
For four years?

477
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,867
You expect me to
stay like this until then?

478
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,037
Come back here!
You arrogant prick! That punk.

479
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,582
If you're unhappy with me,
then try possessing Dr. Kim.

480
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,376
If you think it's unfair,
then wake up from your coma.

481
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,635
You're not a baby duckling.

482
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,970
How long are you going to follow me?

483
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,388
Don't you have things to do?

484
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,685
He must be on the phone.

485
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,148
Yes, Brother.

486
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:26,069
Seung-jo's follow-up treatment?

487
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,864
I'm coming.

488
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,286
So in this case…

489
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,498
I think it applies here.

490
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,210
It's not urgent, but eventually…

491
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,464
Don't walk away.
You wanted to go to the restaurant, right?

492
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,285
Yes.

493
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,205
I can see you.

494
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,818
I thought he had gotten better.

495
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:51,654
Seung-tak.

496
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,573
Oh, no.

497
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,202
He's so petty.

498
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,580
He won't treat me to ox bone stew
unless I do this.

499
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,542
This is what he wanted all along.
To use my skills.

500
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,169
For four years?

501
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,670
That's not going to happen.

502
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:36,407
Dr. Cha?

503
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,620
You're awake, Seung-jo?

504
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,371
Doctor.

505
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:46,459
What are you doing inside him?

506
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:48,961
-What?
-What?

507
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:52,131
It's not Dr. Cha. Let's go.

508
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,341
It's the young doctor.

509
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,676
He doesn't look possessed to me.

510
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:10,066
CHA YOUNG-***

511
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,447
I don't have much time.
So listen carefully, Dr. Ahn.

512
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,282
-Who--
-Don't look. Just listen.

513
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,743
Seung-tak?

514
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,287
Do I look like Seung-tak to you?

515
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,041
Dr. Ahn, you're lucky
we're in an operating room.

516
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,292
Get out of my sight.

517
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,961
I'm not letting you operate
on this patient.

518
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,643
What is it, Doctor?

519
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,355
Never mind.

520
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,121
What was I thinking?

521
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,541
I've gone mad.

522
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,544
Good morning.

523
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,517
What was that?

524
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,270
What did Seung-jo see?

525
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,523
Is it because of the drugs?

526
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,706
This is the country's top VIP room.

527
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,250
Everything is perfect.

528
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,378
LEE JI-***

529
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,889
I didn't detect anything abnormal
in the tests.

530
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,391
His blood flow is good.
No infarction either.

531
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,852
His gradient echo doesn't show any damage.

532
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,563
I know. Everything looks good.

533
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,232
Why isn't the patient waking up?

534
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,524
Dr. Jang?

535
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,323
You can continue with that.

536
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,202
Why won't this lid fit?

537
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,454
What's wrong with this?

538
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,248
What's this?

539
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,500
Oh my…

540
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,544
It's bent inward.

541
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:36,921
I had no idea.

542
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:40,758
You have to look carefully
to find things like this.

543
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:43,719
No wonder it was smelly. It didn't fit.

544
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:45,930
Let me see.

545
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:50,851
Trash cans and the human body
need to have a good fit to work properly.

546
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,272
I'll take this somewhere to bend it back.

547
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,462
Dr. Jang did what?

548
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,840
Dr. Park was the patient's
primary care physician,

549
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:23,217
but Dr. Jang took over the patient's care.

550
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,553
I found it odd.

551
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,306
Why are you telling me that now?

552
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:29,765
I'm sorry.

553
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:33,269
I thought you were preoccupied
with Dr. Cha's and the chairman's case.

554
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,773
Why can't he just die?

555
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,860
Even if he were to wake up, he won't talk.
So no need to worry.

556
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,361
He's also guilty.

557
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,994
But we can't predict what people will do.

558
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,370
I'll keep an eye on him.

559
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,881
What? It's already noon?

560
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,632
But the squeezing procedure
doesn't take that long.

561
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,720
What? Why do I have stains?

562
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:21,025
You're looking at another woman.
What about Dr. Jang?

563
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,905
Why are you bringing her up?

564
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:30,326
What?

565
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:32,578
She's…

566
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,333
I should've told you this sooner. Sorry.

567
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:40,711
I thought it wasn't her.
So it's really her.

568
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,136
THE SHINIEST STAR, JESSICA

569
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,934
You're a big fan of girl groups.

570
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,353
You got to see your idol in person.

571
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:59,605
You've achieved your dream as a fan.

572
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:01,607
No, it's not like that.

573
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,567
What's wrong with being a middle-aged fan?

574
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,694
You should be proud of being a fan.

575
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,029
You're a fan?

576
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:08,531
What?

577
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,573
What?

578
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:13,411
I was wondering why you changed your mind.

579
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:16,330
So you'll operate on your favorite singer?

580
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,041
Amazing.

581
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:22,294
-What are you talking about?
-Anyway, it's good news.

582
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:25,589
Dr. Ban asked Dr. Han to do the surgery
when you said no.

583
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,801
I don't trust Dr. Han.
You know this is a difficult surgery.

584
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:31,762
Surgery? What surgery? What?

585
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,432
Why are you yelling?
What's gotten into you?

586
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,435
LEE JI-***

587
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,228
Lee Ji-woo?

588
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,106
Jessica the singer is Lee Ji-woo?

589
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:43,774
You didn't know?

590
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,443
When she performs as a singer,
she's Jessica.

591
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,735
When she acts, she's Lee Ji-woo.

592
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,195
How could you not know? You're a fan.

593
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:53,742
So let me explain. I should've told you.

594
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:57,121
What are you looking at?
You're giving me the creeps.

595
00:40:57,204 --> 00:41:00,166
I clearly told you
I have to agree to it first.

596
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,168
You were supposed to
report to me what you did.

597
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:04,211
Did you not hear me?

598
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,464
Hey, Seung-tak.

599
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,091
All right.

600
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,926
Well, while you were
in the operating room--

601
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,095
What kind of procedure is it?

602
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,806
Reoperation on heart valve prostheses.

603
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,392
She had a heart valve operation
ten years ago.

604
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,895
The valve needs to be replaced
since it's worn out.

605
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,147
Did you not know when you said yes?

606
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,237
How can you say you won't do it?

607
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,363
What's your reason?

608
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,575
I did raise my hand impulsively.

609
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,869
I was going to
ask for your permission afterward.

610
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,245
Come on.

611
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,748
It's not a difficult procedure
if you think about it.

612
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:44,752
When you were sleeping in a cold bed,
I moved you to a warm one.

613
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,337
Even though I was exhausted,

614
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,756
I stayed at Seung-jo's side all night.

615
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,508
Inside your weak body.

616
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:54,303
I even did a squeezing
that first-year residents usually do.

617
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,182
This isn't the time to take risks.
We're in a tricky situation.

618
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,310
What situation?

619
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:02,853
What's happening?

620
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:03,938
Never mind.

621
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,232
We don't have time for that patient.

622
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:08,359
We have to find a way
to wake the motorcyclist.

623
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:11,028
Yes?

624
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,405
What?

625
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,324
She found the issue.

626
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:16,450
What?

627
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,745
He has sinking skin flap syndrome.

628
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:21,789
Have you had lunch?

629
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,708
Ate lunch?

630
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,879
Don’t skip your meals.

631
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,215
It's a syndrome
caused by depression of the skull.

632
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:34,552
A rare complication
due to a large skull bone defect.

633
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:39,056
Due to blood flow issues inside the brain,
focal neurologic signs will emerge.

634
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,767
You see this depressed area?

635
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:48,482
Due to the bandages around his head,
his previous doctor missed that.

636
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,235
-Then?
-Then?

637
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,778
We'll do a cranioplasty.

638
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,823
Once he receives surgery,
he could get better.

639
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,452
This patient has answers, right?

640
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,706
I'll reveal everything.

641
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:05,541
I'll do it.

642
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,418
Thank you.

643
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:08,627
Thank you, Doctor.

644
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:11,672
Jung-hee.

645
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:15,426
We'll have to see once he wakes up.
We'll see what he has to say.

646
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:18,596
I'll try my best to save the patient.

647
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:22,349
This is all I can do for now.

648
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,530
If you wait a little more,
I think I can recover.

649
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:38,782
I think I'll live.

650
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:41,201
Just be patient.

651
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,009
Seung-tak?

652
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:02,973
Let's be careful around people, okay?
I can't do this by myself.

653
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:12,358
-What are you doing here?
-What about you?

654
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:15,194
I'd like to punch you in the throat. You!

655
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,821
-Damn you!
-You brought someone lunch?

656
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,156
Whose lunch?

657
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,074
Damn it!

658
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:26,955
Administrative Director,
what brings you here?

659
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,169
I was worried you were skipping
your meals, so I bought you lunch.

660
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:35,089
-You should eat something.
-Why are you bringing her lunch?

661
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:45,849
Why are you accepting it?

662
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,668
Why does he keep showing his face there?

663
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:25,472
Mr. Kim, please do that for me.

664
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:40,154
So there you are.

665
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:42,072
One might think you're juggling two women.

666
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:45,284
In a reoperation, opening the chest

667
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,494
requires a delicate approach.

668
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,999
During the dissection,
you could kill the patient

669
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,876
if you damage the coronary artery.

670
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:55,085
I said I'm not doing it.

671
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:59,506
If the aortic root in the coronary artery
is stretched, that'll be critical.

672
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,592
We could get found out if we do another--

673
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,510
When replacing the heart valve prostheses,

674
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,637
you have to fix
the aortic root in that case.

675
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:09,057
You'll have to remove
the coronary artery and reattach it.

676
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,642
It's challenging.

677
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:13,729
When you reattach it,
any pressure you apply

678
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,523
will cause a myocardial infarction.

679
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,443
You told me it wasn't that difficult.

680
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,449
If it were difficult,
were you going to do it?

681
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:26,825
I'll be doing it.

682
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,955
-Dr. Cha.
-What?

683
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,626
Where is he?

684
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:51,308
He broke his promise.

685
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:55,145
How irresponsible.

686
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,105
I know. He's so irresponsible.

687
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,190
And he betrays people.

688
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:08,033
So Dr. Cha

689
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:10,994
is inside your body?

690
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:23,173
That's Dr. Cha's patient.

691
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,342
And Seung-tak operated on him.

692
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,760
How is that possible?

693
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:29,054
Seung-tak performed
that complicated surgery?

694
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:40,691
-I knew it.
-He doesn't look possessed to me.

695
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,273
We shouldn't have come to this hospital.

696
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:23,233
Dr. Cha isn't available anyway.

697
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,821
Doctors are all the same.

698
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,157
Let them pick any doctor.

699
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,284
I don't care.

700
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,161
Hey, don't say that.

701
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,456
I'm going out to get some fresh air.

702
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:51,178
Hey, kid.

703
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,432
Do you want some candy?

704
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:04,024
Do you know this candy?

705
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:06,026
Of course.

706
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,945
It's the magic candy I gave her
ten years ago.

707
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:11,740
There's no such thing as magic candy.

708
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:15,035
You didn't hold onto this
for ten years, have you?

709
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,787
I always check the expiration date.

710
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:20,040
That's funny.

711
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,960
Children have quite an imagination.

712
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,882
So you operated on Seung-jo.

713
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:34,304
He made a promise to me.

714
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,808
Could you keep that promise instead?

715
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:42,521
I won't blame you if the operation
isn't successful. So don't worry.

716
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:50,404
If it weren't for him,
I would have died ten years ago.

717
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:12,259
You saved her life ten years ago.
You should've told me.

718
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:15,846
Weren't you a resident ten years ago?

719
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,683
You weren't possessed just once
when you were an intern, I guess.

720
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:23,770
I'm not good at beating around the bush.

721
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:27,607
How did you do that complicated surgery
when you were an intern?

722
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:31,153
It's a mystery that nobody has solved.

723
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:33,905
Is that also a private matter?

724
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:37,117
You want to know?

725
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:42,914
If you're curious,
do 100 squat reps today.

726
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:45,292
And don't be late
for tomorrow's operation. Bye.

727
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,545
You seem to always get the upper hand.

728
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:50,547
Aren't we supposed
to have some give-and-take?

729
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:51,882
You need my body.

730
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,217
Oh gosh. What are you doing?

731
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:58,221
Stay still. You don't want me
to possess you, right?

732
00:50:58,305 --> 00:50:59,473
Of course, not.

733
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,892
So keep hiding me. Open your coat.

734
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,187
Let's go.

735
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,396
What?

736
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,941
What is he doing?

737
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:13,904
What's going on?

738
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:16,740
-What are you doing?
-I'm trying to hide. Can't you see?

739
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:20,911
-From who?
-Don't look back.

740
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,078
Please don't.

741
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,916
What is he doing? Is he flashing someone?

742
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:30,504
What are you doing there?

743
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,097
How can you be so thoughtless?

744
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,433
He's on the brink of death.

745
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:45,477
Do you want to push him
to the edge and kill him?

746
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,104
Is that your plan?

747
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,190
Whose idea was it?

748
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:54,986
I should punch you in the throat.

749
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:58,365
Dr. Koh sent this?

750
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:00,283
He says you shouldn't skip your meals.

751
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,202
He's very worried about your health.

752
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:03,870
Please enjoy.

753
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,629
I knew it. You didn't eat this.

754
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:15,924
I'll take this with me and throw it out.

755
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:26,893
EUNSANG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

756
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,483
LEE JI-***, CARDIOLOGY
DR. HAN YOUNG-HO, ON STANDBY

757
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:50,208
Don't worry and just relax.
I'll see you when you wake up.

758
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,836
On behalf of all your fans,
we'll be cheering for you.

759
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:56,089
"Jessica, the shiniest star!"

760
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:58,049
"Sparkle, sparkle. Go!"

761
00:52:58,758 --> 00:52:59,843
You can do it!

762
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:03,388
The mentor and student are both the same.

763
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:06,516
Hurry up.

764
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,685
Yes, sure. Hurry now.

765
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,103
Careful.

766
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:22,741
Where is he?

767
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,784
Why isn't Seung-tak here yet?

768
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:37,047
Damn it.

769
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,217
What's the matter with Seung-tak?

770
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:44,095
Is he crazy? Surgery isn't child's play.

771
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,765
He keeps changing his mind.

772
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:48,391
Is he kidding?

773
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:50,477
What's going on?

774
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,645
Where is Seung-tak?

775
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:57,651
Be on your toes. I need you to be alert.

776
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:58,568
Yes, Doctor.

777
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:01,154
We're beginning Lee Ji-woo's operation.
Scalpel.

778
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:06,159
No.

779
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:11,748
Did he go to work?

780
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:13,416
Seung-tak!

781
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,834
Seung-tak!

782
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:19,255
Let him sleep.

783
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:22,467
He must have a reason for missing work.

784
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:25,387
Let him rest.

785
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,701
The plasty will go smoothly.

786
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:50,620
We expect it'll take two hours.

787
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:11,141
You're all dead. Come at me!

788
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:30,118
How could he
stab me in the back like this?

789
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:32,412
He could have told me
if he didn't want to do it.

790
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,878
The chest is open.

791
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:41,880
Now let's dissect the aorta.

792
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:52,932
Metzenbaum scissors.

793
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:58,480
Be careful there. That's soft tissue.

794
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:00,106
Don't tear it. Keep it exposed.

795
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,692
Dr. Han, please. Be careful.

796
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:06,029
If you damage
the coronary artery, it'll be bad.

797
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,031
Slowly. Be careful.

798
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:09,199
Yes.

799
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:10,784
Good.

800
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:11,993
Not there. Damn it.

801
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:15,955
Dr. Han!

802
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:18,625
The patient's blood pressure is falling.

803
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,126
Stop the bleeding.

804
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,796
Why is this?

805
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:45,068
I'm sorry for being late.

806
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:47,403
That's okay. Come in.
I'm glad you're here.

807
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:48,571
Seung-tak! You punk!

808
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:02,252
We'll stop the bleeding
in the coronary artery first.

809
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:03,503
Get the pump ready.

810
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,506
Prolene 6/0. Large needle.
Double-armed suture.

811
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:40,331
Seung-tak, stop right there!

812
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:45,128
What the hell. Where were you?

813
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:49,424
It was a close call.

814
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:53,136
I think it ended well
for our last operation.

815
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:55,346
-What?
-Let me ask you something.

816
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:59,809
What did you mean when you said
you couldn't enter my body anymore?

817
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:02,979
And what was that about
in the operating room?

818
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:07,233
I can't possess you anymore,
so cancel the surgery right now.

819
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,318
I'm a doctor.

820
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:10,653
I'll eventually die
whether or not I enter your body.

821
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:12,155
He's on the brink of death.

822
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:14,240
Do you want to push him
to the edge and kill him?

823
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,826
Is that your plan?

824
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,996
If he keeps possessing
the young doctor's body, he might die.

825
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,789
So why are you asking him for favors?

826
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,587
Our deal ends here.

827
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,589
I can't do this anymore.
It's not my style.

828
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:54,739
Time out. What's the name of the patient?

829
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:08,336
You don't need to hide from us.
Where can you even hide?

830
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:10,547
I know.

831
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,298
It's not like you owe us.

832
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:16,719
Why didn't you tell us the truth
about your ability?

833
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,805
You made us look like heartless people.

834
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:23,142
A walnut snack is not as important
as a person's life.

835
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,770
What? I'm not following…

836
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:36,948
Delete all the footage
that has Seung-tak in it.

837
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,576
All of it.

838
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:41,828
Why?

839
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:46,541
Are you afraid someone will find out?

840
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,258
I came to do just that.

841
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:58,428
But you beat me to it.

842
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,270
The operation went well.

843
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:09,564
Let's see how he recovers.

844
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:13,985
So this is where you're hiding?

845
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:19,282
You made me look everywhere for you.

846
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:21,826
How can you be exhausted
after just a few hours of surgery?

847
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:24,662
Squats won't be enough for you.

848
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,915
Where are you going?

849
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:38,176
Let me ask you something, too.

850
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:40,762
Why did you come then?

851
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:43,139
You could've stayed home.

852
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:47,894
To some doctors,

853
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:52,023
a patient's life means everything to him.

854
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,943
Even when he's exhausted,

855
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:58,446
he'll write up the OP record.

856
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:06,996
OPERATION RECORD
PATIENT: OH SEUNG-JO

857
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:15,004
And he…

858
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,467
promised one of his patients.

859
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,177
He wanted to keep that promise

860
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:24,097
even though his life is at risk.

861
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,309
Do you still want to know?

862
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:31,729
How I performed that surgery alone

863
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:33,314
when I was an intern.

864
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:35,566
What happened that day…

865
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,774
This patient's aortic aneurysm
has ruptured.

866
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:19,569
I told you we don't have
any doctors available to perform surgery.

867
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:20,820
The other hospitals couldn't take him.
We had no choice.

868
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:23,156
We can't operate on him.
Hurry up and leave.

869
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,491
-Hey, turn them away.
-Yes, okay.

870
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:26,409
Please, go.

871
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:29,245
-Please save my husband's life.
-In life,

872
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:31,914
some moments come at you fast.

873
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:39,756
-Please, Doctor. My husband.
-And you search for God in those moments.

874
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,424
And if God is too busy
to hear your prayers,

875
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:44,761
you'll wish a demon could come and help.

876
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:49,640
We'd like to help,
but we don't have any doctors available.

877
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:57,440
-Open your eyes, Dear.
-The patient will die if we turn him away.

878
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:00,777
We're sorry.
We don't have any surgeons available.

879
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:03,905
My poor husband worked his entire life.

880
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,324
Things have finally gotten better for us.

881
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:08,284
-Please, Doctor.
-Hurry up and get them out!

882
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,036
Okay. Let's move it.

883
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:12,830
Dear. No!

884
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:05,091
-What are you doing?
-I'm being careful.

885
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:06,676
-Because you call the shots.
-I'll take the patient.

886
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:08,052
Am I your avatar?

887
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:09,720
No, you're just Seung-tak.

888
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:12,598
Do you have amnesia?
I call the shots here!

889
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:15,017
Don't you want to save a life
with your own hands

890
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:17,562
-instead of just helping out?
-You need to protect your son.

891
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:19,188
Let's have you leave the hospital.

892
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:20,857
Welcome back to the real world.

893
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,358
Who are you?

894
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:24,026
Are you as angry as I am?

895
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,904
-Are you going to give up?
-You bought me some time.

896
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:28,531
Looks like everyone is here.

897
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:30,366
You're really going to die.

898
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:37,748
