1
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:45,920
Where am I?

2
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,714
What's happening to me?

3
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,382
You need strong stamina
to be a heart surgeon.

4
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:53,178
I can't say enough about that.
You don't have the basics to be one.

5
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,056
Let's get going now that you had a break.
There's no time to lose.

6
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,648
You gave him 5,000?

7
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:10,153
I was preoccupied
so I asked Seung-tak to do it.

8
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,488
You're here to talk about
the heparin levels, right?

9
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,697
That punk… He was right here.

10
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,664
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

11
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,382
Blood pressure and pulse are stable.

12
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,219
Chest tube color and drained fluid levels
look normal.

13
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,304
Then why…

14
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,141
Seung-tak's lung capacity is so weak.

15
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,227
Total lack of exercise.

16
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:44,354
But why did you call me?

17
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,189
Well…

18
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,609
You punks.

19
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,611
You should have come this quick that time.

20
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:54,948
I called you all just in case,
and Dr. Koh got here first.

21
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,407
You think he's breathing on his own?

22
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,326
Yes. Take a look.

23
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,713
What's happening to him?

24
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,092
The ventilator is set to 12 bpm,
but he's breathing at 20 bpm.

25
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,427
-I think he's able to breathe on his own.
-Really?

26
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,847
Switch to SIMV mode--

27
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,933
Jae-won, get him scanned for a brain MRI.
Dr. Lee, call Dr. Eun.

28
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,895
Come on! Get to it!

29
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,235
Do you want to be
his primary care physician?

30
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,947
I know it's you, Dr. Ahn.

31
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,657
I mean…

32
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,079
I know that you are
Dr. Cha's primary care physician.

33
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,499
You've worked closely
with him for many years.

34
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,834
So think about

35
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,378
what Dr. Cha would do.

36
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:01,139
Jae-won, contact the diagnostics center.
And Dr. Lee, page Dr. Eun.

37
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,640
Okay.

38
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,656
It feels warm.

39
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,040
And there's a pulse.

40
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,209
Let's wake up now.

41
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,545
You can do it.

42
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:37,008
I'm rooting for you, Cha Young-min.

43
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,725
Are you out of your mind?

44
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:49,562
He's not brain dead. A coma patient
will sometimes breathe on his own.

45
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,481
You adjust the ventilator and wait.

46
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,982
Whose idea was it to page me?

47
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,068
Young doctors might not know that.

48
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,903
But you, Dr. Ahn…

49
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,655
Didn't Dr. Cha teach you that?

50
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:00,865
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,872
Have I become stupid?

52
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:12,043
If I were alive and kicking,
I wouldn't be inside this punk's body.

53
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,222
I don't have much time.
So listen carefully, Dr. Ahn.

54
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,391
-Who--
-Don't look. Just listen.

55
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:29,018
You know that Seung-tak
gave too much heparin to the chairman.

56
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,561
That wasn't a mistake. It was deliberate.

57
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,855
Mr. Han gave the order.
They're in it together.

58
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,691
So make sure that Seung-tak
attends the conference tomorrow.

59
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,025
You'll be able to expose the truth.

60
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,527
You know I believe in you, right?

61
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,861
Make sure he attends.

62
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:47,954
Seung-tak?

63
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,264
PATIENT INFORMATION SEARCH:
JANG GWANG-DEOK

64
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,437
Where's the coffee I asked for?

65
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,319
What the…

66
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,361
What did she just do?

67
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,613
Was she swinging a bat?

68
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,574
Does she slap you all the time?

69
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,993
Ten times one is ten.

70
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,911
-Seung-tak?
-Ten times two is twenty.

71
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,414
Why is he reciting
the multiplication table?

72
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,752
Where are you going?

73
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,628
Heading to the ICU?

74
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,173
It's too late now.

75
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:57,857
Why is she looking at this?

76
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,786
I'm sorry for wasting your time
by overreacting.

77
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,621
You don't need to apologize.

78
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,664
You were hoping he would wake up.
We understand.

79
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,713
I'm pretty sure

80
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:24,300
he temporarily breathed on his own
for a moment, right?

81
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,309
In that case,
you just adjust the ventilator tube

82
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,061
since he's not brain dead.

83
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,021
You shouldn't have conducted an MRI.

84
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,232
You're not even going to cover the costs.

85
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,692
Hey, it was your idea to do an MRI.

86
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,986
It was?

87
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,865
I'll pay the bill for the MRI.

88
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,496
What's going on?

89
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,747
He's been acting weird.

90
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,999
He's acting crazy, isn't he?

91
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,002
Is he feeling guilty?

92
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,179
What is it?

93
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,931
Are you disappointed that I'm still alive?

94
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:15,351
Or are you relieved
that I didn't wake up from my coma?

95
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,603
Seung-tak.

96
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,108
Don't come any closer.

97
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:29,449
You…

98
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,493
What did you mean earlier?

99
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,874
That Mr. Han made you do it?

100
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:41,627
And that you're in it together with him.

101
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,046
Me?

102
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,466
That's absurd.

103
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,760
He isn't in the position
to order me around.

104
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,345
And why would I team up with him?

105
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,057
Be there at 9 a.m.
I'll text you which room to come to.

106
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,479
You wanted to attend
the conference tomorrow.

107
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,022
So you could expose the truth.

108
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,399
Did I say that?

109
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,318
Yes, you did.

110
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,237
I don't know
what you're planning to expose,

111
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,283
but attend the meeting
and tell them what you know.

112
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,660
Dr. Ahn, you're doing great.

113
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,127
Dr. Cha's reputation is on the line.

114
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,755
Don't miss it.

115
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,930
You heard him.
You have to attend the conference.

116
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,307
Don't think about running away.

117
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,559
You can't wiggle out of this.

118
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:42,104
I'm going to force you to
reveal what you did that day.

119
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:48,903
How will you do that?

120
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,867
Are you going to possess his body again?

121
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,536
Why is that a problem?

122
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,162
You do it all the time.

123
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,288
Yes, I do.

124
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,958
But I don't abuse my power.

125
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,378
I'm a ghost with principles.
I'm a class act.

126
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,551
That gave me the creeps.

127
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,136
LEAD SURGEON: CHA YOUNG-MIN
ASSISTANT SURGEON: AHN TAE-HYUN

128
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,137
HEART SURGEON: DR. CHA YOUNG-MIN

129
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,472
I knew it. It was Dr. Cha.

130
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:20,810
Gosh.

131
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:23,980
I'm heading home.

132
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,815
I'll treat you to coffee tomorrow.
Two cups.

133
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,692
You're definitely not okay after that.

134
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,528
I'm shocked as it is.

135
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,324
But does he know something?

136
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,035
I was skeptical of Seung-tak

137
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,162
even after he performed surgery
on Dr. Cha.

138
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,915
I thought there was some hype
about his skills.

139
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,878
But he was acting
totally differently today, wasn't he?

140
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,088
I know.

141
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,841
It's as if he's a different person.

142
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,759
I thought he was possessed by a spirit.

143
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,596
There's no such thing as ghosts.

144
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,975
In med school, he was super smart
and had an attitude to match.

145
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,937
Once in a while,
he would get into the zone.

146
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,899
And he'd act
like a totally different person.

147
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,359
What are you talking about?

148
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,320
Be more specific.

149
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:13,988
Sorry?

150
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,866
Oh, my. He came by again.

151
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:25,207
Here's a little something
for your hard work and dedication.

152
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,753
Oh, my. Someone gave this to us.

153
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:37,428
It's my humble request to you
to work hard even when you get tired.

154
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:44,602
I don't interfere with someone's life.
And don't put my nose in their business.

155
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,980
I do the little things
that don't really affect anything.

156
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,483
But these little things
could be helpful just a bit.

157
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,111
Now open wide.

158
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,450
I don't do it purely out of the goodness
of my heart.

159
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,787
It's a little give-and-take.

160
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,882
I don't think you injected
any anesthetics.

161
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,759
Doctor, I don't think you did.

162
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,638
Did you not inject any anesthetics?

163
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,599
My tooth! That hurts!

164
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:39,240
To pay you back
for letting me possess your body…

165
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,535
Now the anesthetics are kicking in.

166
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,495
I don't feel a thing.

167
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,916
What's important is
to go about your business

168
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,626
and leave the body quickly.

169
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,962
If you stay too long,

170
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,382
you could complicate a person's life.

171
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,426
Humans live by rules

172
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,887
and so do we as ghosts.

173
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:06,267
So don't meddle in human problems.
Leave that to them.

174
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:08,936
They're as smart

175
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,021
as you are.

176
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,565
This is about my life.

177
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:15,359
Let the living handle that, too.

178
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,820
Don't disrupt someone's life.

179
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,573
And what did Seung-tak do wrong?

180
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,075
He deserves it.

181
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,327
How do you know if he deserves it or not?

182
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,037
I saw the chairman's chart.

183
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,914
The operation was a success.

184
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:29,957
But then that punk…

185
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,502
If it weren't for those two,
the chairman would have been cured.

186
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,920
And I wouldn't be in a coma.

187
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,964
I can never forgive them.

188
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,636
I see. Then do as you please.

189
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,682
Your life is hanging in the balance

190
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,767
but I can't stop you.

191
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,441
See you around.

192
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,658
Dr. Cha is in a coma?

193
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,538
Thank you for telling me.

194
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,310
EUNSANG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

195
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,604
This is maddening.

196
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,524
Why isn't he here yet?

197
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,568
Is he planning to skip the meeting?

198
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,529
I'm going crazy here.

199
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:49,912
Damn it!

200
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,248
What is this barrier made of?

201
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,250
How does this appear out of thin air?

202
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,751
This is crazy. Geez.

203
00:13:58,921 --> 00:13:59,922
He needs to be here.

204
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,641
Why are we holding the conference
in this room?

205
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,126
I think there's another case
they'll be discussing.

206
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,878
They're from the legal team.

207
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,476
Over here.

208
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:15,831
Why are they here?

209
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,253
What are they planning now?

210
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,926
Try whatever you want.

211
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,761
You're not going to get your way.

212
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,692
All right. He's here.

213
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,116
Come here. Hurry.

214
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,790
All right. Seung-tak, come on.

215
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,170
Gosh. I got it. I'll be there.

216
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:07,216
Why is he badgering me about it?

217
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,096
Okay. I'll reveal the truth.
If that's what he wants…

218
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,023
That young kid…

219
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:27,152
He wouldn't lie and say he didn't do it.

220
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,655
So trust my instincts.

221
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:34,410
I'm a good judge of people.

222
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,579
This time, I'll just watch.

223
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,791
But I won't stop myself
if things go wrong.

224
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:56,265
After the surgery, Dr. Cha told me
he had to go somewhere.

225
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,519
I'll be right back.
So stay by the patient's side.

226
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,563
Call me if there's any change
in his condition.

227
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,151
Do you know where he was going?

228
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,360
He didn't tell me.

229
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,156
It seemed like it was very urgent.
He left in a hurry.

230
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,451
What was so urgent
that he had to leave the patient?

231
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,536
That was unprofessional.

232
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,954
Hippocrates.

233
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,584
While checking the patient,

234
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,170
I noticed his heart rate increasing
and called Dr. Cha.

235
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:32,009
I was told to do an echocardiogram.
We suspected a broken suture.

236
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,844
I called Dr. Cha
but he didn't answer his phone.

237
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,473
I think it was because he was
in an accident at the time.

238
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,317
So I tried to perform emergency surgery.

239
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,237
The patient's life was on the line,
so I had to do something.

240
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,073
What? Dr. Han can't come?

241
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,575
No, he says he's in another city.

242
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,410
That's an excuse.

243
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,495
He doesn't want to take the blame
if the patient dies.

244
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,246
Then, Dr. Ban, you can do it.

245
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:05,542
Why should I take the blame?
He's Dr. Cha's patient, not mine.

246
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,504
Wait for Dr. Cha to get here
and try paging other doctors.

247
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,339
Okay.

248
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,423
Listen up.

249
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,760
If anything happens to the chairman,
it's Dr. Cha's fault, okay?

250
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:21,266
Dr. Kim suggested that
we conduct an APTT test just in case.

251
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,353
Take this.

252
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,272
I need an APTT test.
It's an emergency. Please, hurry.

253
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,609
But it was uncheckable.
His heparin levels were too high.

254
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,778
WHEN LEVELS ARE TOO HIGH
OR TOO LOW TO BE MEASURED

255
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,117
Why did you have that test taken?

256
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:43,122
Because Dr. Ahn
gave a specific instruction before that.

257
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,581
What kind of instructions?

258
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,711
I instructed him to give the patient
a continuous dose of 1,000.

259
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:59,388
But why? I clearly told you
to give him a dose of 500.

260
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,434
I told you to inject

261
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,480
1,000 units of heparin, right?

262
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,401
Didn't I? Damn it.

263
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,195
Did you give the patient 5,000 units then?

264
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,575
I was curious about that.
Are you sure Dr. Cha ordered that?

265
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:23,579
What? Dr. Ahn told me
that Dr. Cha ordered that dose.

266
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,831
He told me it was 5,000 units
even though it wasn't a surgery.

267
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,207
I found it strange but…

268
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,333
What's important is…

269
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,877
-Hey Seung-tak.
-So…

270
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:33,172
did you inject the heparin
into the patient, Dr. Kim?

271
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,256
What dosage?

272
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,511
I didn't do it.

273
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,972
If you didn't, then who did?

274
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,986
What the…

275
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,863
Why aren't you saying anything?

276
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,908
You're backing out now?
Afraid to tell the truth?

277
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,118
I knew it. You punk…

278
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,161
It was me.

279
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,465
Dr. Kim asked me
to inject the heparin as a favor.

280
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,982
Dr. Koh. Could you tell me
what Dr. Kim asked you to do?

281
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,194
He told me to raise the heparin dose
to 1,000 units.

282
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,738
And did you do that?

283
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,538
Dr. Koh, please tell us
what dosage you gave to the patient.

284
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,250
I didn't inject any heparin.
Not even one unit of it.

285
00:20:58,548 --> 00:20:59,883
I knew you'd screw it up.

286
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,803
Why did I even trust you?

287
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:03,720
It's the truth.

288
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,891
I didn't lay a hand
on Mr. Jang Gwang-deok.

289
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,230
How can you prove that?

290
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,439
Do you have proof?

291
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,191
I can't prove that I didn't do it.

292
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,487
But I do have a witness.

293
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:35,627
Dr. Koh came and asked to see the patient,
Jang Gwang-deok.

294
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,436
Can I see his chart?

295
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,895
Sure.

296
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,441
-There it is.
-After checking the chart,

297
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:00,610
I saw that a continuous dose of 500 units
was being administered

298
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,155
to the patient as ordered by Dr. Cha.

299
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,991
He was a cardiac sarcoma patient
who previously suffered a stroke.

300
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,327
The sarcoma was
successively removed in surgery.

301
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,997
To prevent thromboembolism caused by
leftover tumor parts from surgery

302
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,460
that could travel to the neck vessel
through the left atrium and ventricle,

303
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:19,087
heparin is administered
when there is no bleeding.

304
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,679
You're not a trained medical professional.

305
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,931
I thought you studied this
since you're sitting in the front row.

306
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,187
In simpler terms,

307
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,773
heparin is given
to prevent any leftover tumor particles

308
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,691
from blocking vessels in the brain

309
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,277
as it travels through the body.

310
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,989
You do know what heparin does?
It prevents blood clotting.

311
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:47,532
Sure.

312
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:51,286
If you give a high dose of heparin,
blood vessels will rupture.

313
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:52,537
Then what would happen?

314
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,372
The sutures from
the operation could break.

315
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:01,505
I saw that cardiac fibrillation was given
after his operation.

316
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:04,800
To prevent another stroke from occurring,

317
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:08,637
I think Dr. Cha ordered a maximum dose
of 500 units of heparin.

318
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:12,432
When I saw the patient,
he was in stable condition.

319
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:16,645
So raising the dose to 500 units
would have been lethal to the patient.

320
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,314
That's what I'm saying.

321
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,238
There's no need
to raise the heparin dosage.

322
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,490
If any other doctor asks,
tell them I said that.

323
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,826
That'll be it.

324
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,121
VIP INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

325
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,501
After he said that and left,
the doctor didn't return.

326
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,633
I feel like I just got clobbered
in the meeting.

327
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,678
Could you explain what's happening here?

328
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,390
Gosh. Then who injected heparin?

329
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,392
The test came back as uncheckable.

330
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,312
There are no
security cameras there either.

331
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:44,482
The legal team will find out
who did it soon.

332
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,817
Don't worry about it.

333
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,445
You know I've been
covering your butts this whole time?

334
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,822
Of course, Doctor. We know.

335
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:52,782
We're very grateful.

336
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,243
The doctors here were not
at the hospital that day.

337
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,412
And you were in another city, yes?

338
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:59,122
You came down with a stomach virus.

339
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,583
And your in-law passed.
Did you attend the funeral?

340
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,252
Only Dr. Ban and my team

341
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,380
were involved in the chairman's care
after the operation.

342
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,551
But I can't figure out
why Dr. Cha left the patient's side.

343
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,094
Look at what's happened.

344
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,681
I know he's in a coma right now
but that's so unprofessional of him.

345
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,393
Dr. Ban. He would screw me over
if he had the chance.

346
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,811
He's on Mr. Han's side.

347
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,564
No way.

348
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,734
He's not brave enough to kill someone.

349
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,037
Jae-won.

350
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,749
He would believe it if a doctor said
aspirin can treat a brain tumor.

351
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,878
How did he get through med school
and be a doctor?

352
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,339
But he's a nice guy.

353
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,426
He doesn't even swat a mosquito
because he cares about every creature.

354
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,637
No, it's not him.

355
00:25:56,721 --> 00:26:00,058
Dr. Lee, about the conference…

356
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,060
Didn't you sign an NDA?

357
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,354
It's out of our hands now.

358
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,273
Read a medical journal
if you have time for that.

359
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,400
Sun-ho is so self-centered.

360
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,027
I wonder what kind of doctor
he'll become later on.

361
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,654
He only cares about himself.

362
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,408
He wouldn't sabotage his career though.

363
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,118
No.

364
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,247
Why do I feel so uneasy
after the conference?

365
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,583
They'll say you're lagging behind
first-year residents.

366
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,795
Didn't you see Seung-tak talk?

367
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:31,047
Even a fourth-year resident
would be humbled by him.

368
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,549
What did you say?

369
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,558
Iced Americano. Hot Americano.

370
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,351
Thank you.

371
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,062
I told you I'd buy two cups.

372
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:49,190
This is what I consider two cups.

373
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,110
Are you trying to make it up to us
for being tardy?

374
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,237
Hey, Crystal.

375
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,655
Do you still not know me?

376
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,950
I don't follow a strict work schedule.

377
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,412
Enjoy.

378
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,457
That's right.

379
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:10,670
He's just an arrogant punk
who can't even hold a scalpel.

380
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,716
But he knows medicine like a professor.

381
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,854
Then who injected the heparin?

382
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,982
Was it Dr. Ahn?

383
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,403
A 69-year-old female patient.
Had a CABG for a post MI VSD.

384
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,490
Patched the ventricular septal defect.
Weaned off ECMO four days ago.

385
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:41,117
Extubation two days ago.
She started on solid foods today.

386
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,828
Rhythm is stable at EF 30%.

387
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:48,166
Okay then. Administer Entresto.
Switch her to Clogrel from Fragmin.

388
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:51,503
Administer Entrestro.
And switch to Clogrel from Fragmin.

389
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,424
Dr. Cha cared a lot about this patient.

390
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,468
So be on your toes.

391
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,178
Yes, Doctor.

392
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:12,357
So it was you who ended up
performing surgery on her.

393
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,484
Do an ECG every day.

394
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,611
Once she's moved,
have the ECG monitor her 24/7.

395
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,031
Due to Dr. Cha's accident,
her surgery was delayed for days.

396
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,535
Monitor the patient carefully.
We don't want to let Dr. Cha down.

397
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,120
I'll do my best.

398
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,083
I wasn't thinking straight.

399
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,878
How could I suspect my own team?

400
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:44,472
Doctor.

401
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,475
What about Dr. Cha?

402
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,063
Is there anything else we can do?

403
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,192
Neurology will check on him.

404
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,070
Don't you know Dr. Cha's creed?

405
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:02,073
If a patient has no chance of recovering,
he doesn't look back.

406
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:38,026
The disciple has surpassed the teacher.
What a fine doctor he became.

407
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,362
Seems like his feelings were hurt
by what he taught him.

408
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,451
Hey, he can hear us.

409
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,706
I don't care.
I'm just telling it as it is.

410
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:09,808
Well…

411
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,602
How much longer do I have to work at ER?

412
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,942
I recall Dr. Cha saying that
you need to learn the basics again.

413
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,152
He did say that but Dr. Cha is--

414
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,112
There's nothing for you to do
even if I were to reassign you.

415
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,243
Don't take it too hard.

416
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,662
He's been like that
ever since Dr. Cha's accident.

417
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,916
I can't shake off this uneasiness.

418
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,294
It's so suffocating. Seung-tak…

419
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,089
You're always ignoring me.

420
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:45,009
He heard us. We must have surprised you.

421
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,803
Who are you?

422
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,972
He doesn't recognize his own patients.

423
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,099
Oh, you just tossed us away.

424
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,268
We were as good as dead.

425
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,729
I don't know what you're talking about.

426
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,817
Why are those patients still here?

427
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:04,153
We don't have spare beds.
Have them moved by this week.

428
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:07,699
Why stick with terminal patients
at the expense of other patients?

429
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:10,118
I wonder why they're
holding on so desperately

430
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,120
as if they have
a great life ahead of them?

431
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,873
One should know to let go when it's time.

432
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,295
Now he remembers.

433
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,298
"I wonder why they're
holding on so desperately?"

434
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,675
You don't know us.

435
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,595
What makes you better than us?

436
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,391
What's going on here?

437
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,519
Don't scare him like that.
I'll punch your throat.

438
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:40,273
He's a ghost. None of us are humans.

439
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:44,527
Don't be afraid.
Come and introduce yourself.

440
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:47,488
You'll be seeing them around a lot.

441
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,365
I already know his name.

442
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,409
Let's have a serious conversation,
shall we?

443
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,078
I have a lot of pent-up anger.

444
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,332
Come back here.

445
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,214
-No way.
-What…

446
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,433
What is he thinking now?

447
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:19,395
Did he just possess that guy?
Is that what he did?

448
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:22,899
-I think he did it.
-You possessed him.

449
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:26,361
When he crossed paths with the nurse,
he went through her.

450
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,154
How did he get into that body?

451
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,405
I don't know.

452
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,203
I'm getting a call.

453
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,038
Hello?

454
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:39,582
What?

455
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,892
Why did you do that?
Think of the repercussions.

456
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,564
Well, that'll affect him, not you.

457
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,286
Why isn't it working?

458
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,622
How come he can possess him, but not us?

459
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,249
This is discrimination.

460
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,430
Eleven times one is eleven.

461
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,348
Eleven times two is twenty-two.

462
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,850
Eleven times three is thirty-three.

463
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:45,648
He doesn't look the type,
but he's got a temper.

464
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,150
He's usually not like that.

465
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,193
But he's acting out today.

466
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:11,466
Was it annoying?

467
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,468
You must be.

468
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,594
I understand.

469
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,474
Calm down. You're not crazy.

470
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,850
It's just temporary.

471
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,478
You'll come and go from time to time.

472
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:27,148
I owe you an apology
for thinking it was you.

473
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,485
Also for what happened just now.

474
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,361
I swear. I really didn't know.

475
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,822
And I still don't know what happened.

476
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,533
Besides, I'm not
in a good situation either.

477
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:38,993
So, you see…

478
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,037
Since we're at it…

479
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,040
Who's calling?

480
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,798
Gosh, that punk. Why is he so upset?

481
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,092
Hey, wait for me.

482
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,344
He fell because he was
distracted by his phone.

483
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,346
In the CT, it shows a fracture
in No. 5 and No. 6 right ribs.

484
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,431
There's also a bruise on his side.

485
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,183
And?

486
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:05,228
Besides a drain of 300cc,
there's nothing unusual.

487
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,772
But his heart rate keeps rising
and his blood pressure keeps falling.

488
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,524
And?

489
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,360
He needs emergency surgery

490
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,403
but we don't have
an operating room available.

491
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,866
I think we should treat him somehow
in the meantime.

492
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,870
Why did you call me?
He's an emergency patient.

493
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,122
What?

494
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:28,543
I was wondering if you could become him.

495
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,294
"Him"?

496
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,380
I'll page another doctor right now.

497
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,559
Be alert. Put down your phone.

498
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,687
Show me the CT scan.

499
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,897
You said there was a CT scan.

500
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,609
What?

501
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:54,694
Yes.

502
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,658
His No. 5 right rib is fractured,
and I see signs of hemothorax.

503
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,744
Except for the drain in his chest,
I don't see any bleeding.

504
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,247
If his heart rate is rising
while his blood pressure is falling,

505
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,332
that means he has a burst blood vessel.

506
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,501
It won't show on the CT.
You have to open his chest.

507
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,670
We'll pinpoint the bleeding now.

508
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,797
Get local anesthetics ready.
Bring a scalpel, bovie, and retractor.

509
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:17,300
Also a thoracotomy set.
Angle it so that I can see it.

510
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,679
Come on.

511
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:22,972
You're going to let the patient suffer?

512
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,684
-Okay, sure.
-Sure.

513
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:36,736
I paid you back.

514
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,163
So that was

515
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:50,333
him just now, wasn't it?

516
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,878
I think so.

517
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,342
What am I doing right now?

518
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:11,354
I forgot. I need to be somewhere else.

519
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:15,066
Oh gosh. He's avoiding us.

520
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,527
Now that we said hi,
I was going to give him a few pointers.

521
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,529
We're not going to eat him alive.

522
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,658
He used to be so stuck-up.
Serves you right.

523
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,077
But…

524
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,330
how come he can possess a body
but we can't?

525
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,415
Because they're both doctors?

526
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,681
Could you

527
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:48,683
delete this footage?

528
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:49,642
What?

529
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:51,602
All of it?

530
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:55,064
You know who I am, right?

531
00:37:56,023 --> 00:38:02,280
CONTROL ROOM
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

532
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,078
Not once or twice.

533
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,788
It's not his body!

534
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:12,206
Why is he possessing me?

535
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,374
Why?

536
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,544
Die! Get lost! You frickin' ghost!

537
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,213
Get away from me!

538
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,805
Have I caught a cold?

539
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:29,807
My body is heating up.

540
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,061
I'm not a human.

541
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:37,606
This is insane.

542
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,110
Wait a minute.

543
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,780
Why am I running away from them?

544
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,991
I didn't do anything wrong.

545
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:49,035
What did I say that was so offensive?

546
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,786
I've saved so many lives until now.

547
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:56,208
That's pretty weird.
You two don't seem to like each other.

548
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,254
I'm on the young doctor's side.

549
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,216
Think about why I said that.

550
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,303
Don't you think so? He's so conceited.

551
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,348
It's typical of doctors. They're arrogant.

552
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,099
More so with him, since he's a genius.

553
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,811
Most geniuses
have a little madness in them.

554
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,814
So ignore what he said.

555
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,525
Don't dwell on it.

556
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,824
I'm jealous of you, Seung-tak.

557
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,659
You have supporters.

558
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,127
This seat is so hard.

559
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:47,009
EUNSANG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

560
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,309
Did you hear about Dr. Cha?

561
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:03,150
The air is fresher
and the view is fantastic.

562
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,238
This VIP room is worth staying at.

563
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,578
Don't you get lonely

564
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,081
while staying in this big room?

565
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:20,376
What is it?
Are your roommates bothering you?

566
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,796
Of course, not.

567
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:29,385
When they see me,
they tell me about their aches and pains.

568
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:34,932
I mean the symptoms they had
when they were alive.

569
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:39,937
I guess even a genius like you must think
that I'm not waking up from my coma.

570
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,691
-What?
-You saw my chart, right?

571
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:48,529
If you had found a way to treat me,
you would have come straight here.

572
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:56,412
Well, only God can
bring the dead back to life.

573
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,381
I'll find out who did this to you,

574
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,884
whoever it is behind this.

575
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:13,637
You have your own fish to fry.
You can't back that up.

576
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:15,973
You can rest here for a while.

577
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:18,642
After they move you,
it will be much more crowded there.

578
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,978
Try to adapt to your new place.

579
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,856
You're young so you never know.

580
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:25,774
You might wake up.

581
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:29,028
What? I'm moving somewhere?

582
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:29,987
Where?

583
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,660
I overheard my son talking on the phone.

584
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:40,247
They're going to move you
to another place today.

585
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,374
Please. Open up.

586
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,130
I'll explain later.
It looks like it's an emergency.

587
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,965
-Go in.
-Thanks.

588
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,642
You heard the news

589
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,478
and came to intervene?

590
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:03,896
That's strange.

591
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,814
Why are they moving Dr. Cha?

592
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,609
-It's only been a few days.
-I don’t get it.

593
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,779
The other coma patients
have been here for months.

594
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,533
Maybe they're getting back at him.

595
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,243
Dr. Ban is so mean.

596
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:19,703
It's not Dr. Ban.

597
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,705
Dr. Ban didn't order it.

598
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,374
It's Han, that scoundrel.

599
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:24,875
It's the administrative director's orders.

600
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,835
What?

601
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,170
Why would
the administrative director order this?

602
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,548
I don't know why.

603
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:33,842
If I were to wake up,
his evil scheme will be uncovered.

604
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,719
Doctor, what should we do?

605
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:43,269
That doesn't make any sense.
How could Seung-tak do that?

606
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,812
It really happened.

607
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,522
Everyone here saw him do it.

608
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,691
It really happened.

609
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:49,984
Where is Seung-tak?

610
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,111
So where is he right now?

611
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,739
I don't know. I haven't seen him since.

612
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,032
Dr. Koh?

613
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,951
He called in sick.

614
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,911
What? He's sick?

615
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:10,963
Seung-tak!

616
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,967
Crystal. Not now.

617
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,553
This isn't a dream.
The chairman is on his way.

618
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,388
He found out.

619
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:31,650
As you can see,
Seung-tak isn't in his room, sir.

620
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,320
I didn't hear him leave for work.

621
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:38,907
He must have left
while you were sleeping, sir.

622
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,160
Without saying goodbye?

623
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,830
Seung-tak has been exhausted lately.

624
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,498
He's been working day and night.

625
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,167
Exhausted?

626
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,252
He doesn't do much at the hospital anyway.

627
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:55,758
Then what are you doing here?
You said Seung-tak went to work.

628
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:58,177
Oh, right. I'll be going soon, sir.

629
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:04,475
Report everything he does
back to me, okay?

630
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,209
Well…

631
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,837
about Dr. Cha…

632
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,507
You're having him moved.

633
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:39,635
When I heard he was breathing
on his own, I got alarmed.

634
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,220
The conference also went badly.

635
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:45,182
There are rumors about Dr. Cha,
so we have to get rid of him.

636
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:48,310
But the doctors won't approve of this.

637
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,771
If you go this far…

638
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,860
It's because of you
that I have to do this.

639
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,949
Why did you make things so complicated?

640
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,576
The plan was for Dr. Kim
to take the blame.

641
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,287
Why did you show up
when Dr. Cha arrived in the ER?

642
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,414
You were supposed to hide.

643
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,373
If you were going to save him,

644
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:14,002
why didn't you act quickly and do it?
You messed it all up.

645
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:21,510
Let's make one thing clear between us.

646
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,097
It doesn't matter
who provided the smoking gun.

647
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:28,934
The person who pulled the trigger
is the one who goes down.

648
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,149
You know that.

649
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:58,297
Yes, it's me.

650
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:01,675
Give him a bolus
dose of 5,000 units right now.

651
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,178
Dr. Cha ordered it.

652
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:09,016
JANG GWANG-DEOK, MALE, 77

653
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,477
Damn it. Dr. Kim.

654
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,896
Why couldn't he carry out
a simple instruction?

655
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,698
HEPARIN SODIUM

656
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:36,627
VIP INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

657
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,148
DR. HAN DAE-WOO, ER

658
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,553
It's me.

659
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:33,058
Well, Dr. Ahn has no power to stop it.

660
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:38,146
Damn it. Why isn't Seung-tak
answering his phone?

661
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,481
I can't bear to see this.

662
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:41,525
I'll visit him after he's moved.

663
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:42,901
You have to stop this!

664
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:45,070
No. Don't go. No.

665
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:55,122
The hospital doesn't have spare beds.

666
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:58,375
You need an inflow of patients
to make higher profits.

667
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:02,588
Cut it out.
Don't rub salt into his wounds.

668
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,758
Tess. Where is he right now?

669
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,345
Tess.

670
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,015
Tess!

671
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,601
Tess!

672
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,439
Tess!

673
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,191
Darn it.

674
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,245
No.

675
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:48,884
Seung-tak, what are you doing?
What's your plan?

676
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:53,221
Dr. Ban is coming. Run. Straight ahead.

677
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,098
Faster. Straight ahead.

678
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:02,272
What's going on? When did you get here?

679
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,776
Where are you taking me?
Do you know where you're going?

680
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,823
It's heavy, isn't it?

681
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,701
You should've brought
some people with you to help.

682
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:16,995
You're really…

683
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,414
Oh, gosh.

684
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:23,251
You're not that strong, young man.

685
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,421
Where are you heading? To the elevator?

686
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,258
-Yes.
-What? Is it you, Tess?

687
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:35,472
There we go.

688
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,308
Good job, young man.

689
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:41,269
Don't mention it.

690
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:43,355
Dr. Koh!

691
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,440
-Wait a minute!
-Tess?

692
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,900
-Stop right there!
-It's you, right?

693
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:48,610
Dr. Koh!

694
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:51,530
Dr. Koh…

695
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:55,033
Oh my goodness!

696
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:57,619
Are you okay? I'm so sorry.

697
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,079
-I'm fine.
-Move it.

698
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,580
-Doctor.
-I'm so sorry.

699
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:03,125
Please forgive me.

700
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,300
So you came straight here

701
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:15,220
when you were sleeping at home?

702
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:16,805
To protect me?

703
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:19,725
No way.

704
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:50,338
Hey, Seung-tak.

705
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:54,676
What are you doing?

706
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:57,721
Dr. Koh!

707
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:01,099
What is the meaning of this?

708
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:03,018
Administrative Director.

709
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:06,897
Was it you who gave Dr. Koh
orders to move him?

710
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,065
I didn't need to chase him then.

711
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:10,692
What's going on?

712
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:20,035
Why are you moving my patient?

713
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,170
How come Dr. Jang
is Dr. Cha's primary care physician?

714
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,506
How was this decision made?

715
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,466
The Seattle Hospital requested
an exchange with our hospital

716
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:37,010
and we accepted Dr. Jang
as a visiting doctor.

717
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:40,931
Dr. Jang did her internship
at our hospital previously.

718
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:42,974
Is there a problem?

719
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:45,811
But having her
be his primary care physician is too…

720
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,896
Dr. Cha is being cared for
by the neurology department.

721
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:51,608
But the department feels
a lot of pressure.

722
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:54,611
Turns out that Dr. Jang
is a competent neurosurgeon.

723
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:57,614
And she volunteered to
take him as her patient.

724
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,950
Are you trying to cover up
Seung-tak's blunder?

725
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:01,576
He operated on Dr. Cha--

726
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,537
Administrative Director Han!

727
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:08,917
I think you should pay more attention to
Chairman Jang who is in a coma

728
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,710
rather than our personnel matters

729
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:14,005
which are the hospital director
and chairman of the board's business.

730
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,257
How are you

731
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:17,384
handling that matter?

732
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,137
Someone sent me
my father's medical records

733
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,389
while I was in America.

734
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,266
The sender was anonymous.

735
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:26,726
And he asked me
if surgery was a viable option.

736
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,020
I was supposed to meet the sender
upon arriving in Korea

737
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:30,939
but he didn't show up.
I haven't been contacted by him since.

738
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:33,650
I heard my dad's surgery was a success.

739
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:36,236
So I don't understand
why he's in that state.

740
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:39,406
And Dr. Cha's accident
looks highly suspicious.

741
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:43,034
I was thinking about what I could do.

742
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:46,371
Could you help me, Dr. Koh?

743
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,709
I guess you don't know.

744
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:52,669
I personally don't like Dr. Cha.

745
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:56,089
-Hey, I don’t like you either.
-Then why were you…

746
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:59,259
Weren't you trying to stop him
from being moved to another hospital?

747
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,594
Why did you do that?

748
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:03,638
Out of a sense of duty.
He's the first patient I operated on.

749
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,599
Sense of duty?

750
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,143
You still think you performed
that operation?

751
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,102
That's all I'll do.

752
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,856
I hate complicated situations.

753
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:14,900
I'm not feeling like myself
these days, too.

754
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,359
My brain is woozy.

755
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,194
-Dr. Koh.
-I need to excuse myself.

756
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,113
I called in sick today.

757
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:21,072
My head…

758
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:22,490
That arrogant prick.

759
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:48,141
I came here looking like this?

760
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,728
This is crazy.

761
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,274
Geez.

762
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:01,237
Why did I come like this?

763
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,031
What was I thinking?

764
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:09,621
I can see your face better now.

765
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,963
Is there anything you want to tell me?

766
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:20,882
You had something to tell me…

767
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:23,510
twelve years ago.

768
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:25,971
And a few days ago.

769
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,265
I have a lot to tell you.

770
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,601
You should've told me then.

771
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:34,980
Back then.

772
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,065
And right now.

773
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,484
You should've talked.

774
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:42,696
While looking straight at me.

775
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:49,369
Doctor. What a relief
that you came in the nick of time.

776
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:50,954
Thank you for reaching out to me.

777
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:52,914
We were able to keep Dr. Cha here,
thanks to you.

778
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:57,252
I also called Dr. Koh just in case.
He bought some time for us.

779
00:54:58,294 --> 00:55:00,964
I didn't think he could be
aggressive like that.

780
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:04,175
That was so unpredictable.
I almost fainted.

781
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:09,139
So you're both his doctor
and guardian now?

782
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:13,268
Yes. I hope we'll get along.

783
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:16,766
When did it become autumn?

784
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:21,312
I didn't notice the changing seasons.

785
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:50,133
I'll pay you back big time
for borrowing your car.

786
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:52,510
Seung-tak.

787
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:43,811
They already came out
with fall-winter season suits?

788
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,441
That looks nice.

789
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:54,572
I look handsome.

790
00:58:57,325 --> 00:59:00,662
Being a ghost,
my hair never gets missed up.

791
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:05,333
My gosh.

792
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:23,726
Are you sure?

793
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,479
How many times do I have to tell you?

794
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,022
He was standing behind the barrier

795
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:30,483
and then the young doctor was walking by
so they crossed paths.

796
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,235
He possessed him
and walked out of the hospital.

797
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:36,906
He's so reckless.

798
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,617
He must've felt cooped up here.

799
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:42,370
He simply went out to get some air.
He'll be back soon.

800
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:44,497
His body is here
so he couldn't have gone far.

801
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:45,582
He won't get that far.

802
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,878
Anyway, he should stay
in that body or else…

803
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:53,298
What do you mean?

804
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:11,232
If he is kicked out of the body
while he's outside…

805
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:15,236
What will happen to him?

806
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,537
Seung-tak…

807
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:29,125
-What's wrong with the lady?
-I'll call 911.

808
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:31,169
-Okay.
-Seung-tak.

809
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:35,173
Stay calm.

810
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:37,216
Seung-tak.

811
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:38,968
Help me first.

812
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:52,023
Seung-tak. Not her.

813
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,484
Me. I need some help.

814
01:00:58,363 --> 01:00:59,656
Are you a doctor?

815
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:01,366
What?

816
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:03,159
Well…

817
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,871
I think she has…

818
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:12,543
What?

819
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:14,420
You mean he'll vanish and die?

820
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:27,809
Excuse me.

821
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:33,606
If you're still around…

822
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,027
let's try to save this lady.

823
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:44,867
Let's save her.

824
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:54,729
Can you see me? Can you hear me?

825
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:55,813
Excuse me. Are you around?

826
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:57,523
I'm not here. You're doing great.

827
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,817
You're an embarrassment
to the cardiology department.

828
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:01,903
Well done.

829
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:03,905
Did he do that on purpose?

830
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,574
What is he doing back here?

831
01:03:06,657 --> 01:03:08,951
Dr. Cha isn't in good condition.

832
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:11,078
-Why is he acting like that?
-He wants to live. That's why.

833
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:12,038
I can't possess you anymore.

834
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:13,539
I'll do it.

835
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,041
I assigned Seung-tak
to perform the operation.

836
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,126
How could you do this to me?

837
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:18,211
There's going to be trouble soon.

838
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,755
Do I look like Seung-tak to you?

839
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:27,929
