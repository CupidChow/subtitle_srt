1
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:44,919
Damn it.

2
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,133
It must have been Dr. Cha.

3
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,302
I'm sure it is.

4
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,887
Seung-tak doesn't walk like that.

5
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:54,971
No.

6
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:56,556
No.

7
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,810
-It's Dr. Cha. I know that for a fact.
-It can't be Seung-tak.

8
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,980
It better not be him.
If it was him, he's dead.

9
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:09,319
You shouldn't say that even if you're mad.

10
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,613
You're a doctor, after all.

11
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:14,908
Would you like me to beat him up?

12
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,035
She told me not to tell anyone.

13
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,663
I thought Dr. Jang
was a respectable person.

14
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,499
She's going too far now
after learning the truth.

15
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,217
Yes, Dr. Jang?

16
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,222
What? What's wrong with Seung-tak?

17
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,199
What happened to him?
Why is he unconscious?

18
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,077
-Who's inside him?
-Dr. Cha.

19
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,663
-He needs to be taken to ER.
-Okay.

20
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,459
I haven't ridden in an ambulance
in a while.

21
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:18,471
So somebody beat those two up
before I got to them.

22
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:22,851
Gosh.

23
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:39,033
Hey! What are you doing?

24
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,079
-Hey!
-He's gone crazy.

25
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,269
Can you hear me?

26
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,063
Do you recognize us?

27
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,655
911 RESCUE

28
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,870
This is the first time in 20 years
that I've had to help someone so much.

29
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,170
How am I supposed to return
to the hospital now?

30
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,135
Delete my number and lay low.

31
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,266
He was supposed to die today.

32
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:50,939
Why did she call out
for Cha Young-min though?

33
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,899
She's totally crazy about that doctor.

34
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,707
Young-min.

35
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,833
Young-min.

36
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,543
Young-min!

37
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,797
Se-jin.

38
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,883
I mean Dr. Jang.

39
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,094
You need to get treated first.

40
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,312
I missed you every day of my life.

41
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,315
I wondered how mad you were at me.

42
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,361
I wondered how deep your grudge was.

43
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,200
I wished you'd forget me.

44
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,785
And yet,

45
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,914
I hoped you would still remember me.

46
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,250
I'm not going to lose him again.

47
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,544
That's why I'm trying harder.

48
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,006
Dr. Cha never hated you even once.

49
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,301
He fondly remembers the good memories.

50
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,845
Happy memories with you.

51
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:05,972
That's why he can't hate you.

52
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,182
He doesn't feel it.

53
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,476
And right now

54
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,730
he is trying his best…

55
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,234
to hang in there.

56
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,365
So that you won't…

57
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,162
have to wait long until he wakes up.

58
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,792
So you're a Jessica fan.

59
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:41,549
Yes, let's go to her concert together.

60
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,593
You said you don't cook.

61
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,762
So you always get food delivered?

62
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,347
Yes, but I'm going to start cooking again.

63
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,475
Now that you're here.

64
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,144
It must have been so tough.

65
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:54,896
And frightening.

66
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,190
Not really.

67
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,775
Because you're with me.

68
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,777
You were by my side.

69
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,116
Do you have anything to ask me?

70
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,370
Can I hug you?

71
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,385
EUNSANG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

72
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,179
Good morning.

73
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,061
Good morning!

74
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,188
Why are you acting like this?

75
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,857
What about your future?

76
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,984
Mom, lower your voice.
We're at a hospital.

77
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,610
Did something happen?

78
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:28,781
Well, she threw out all of her books
last night without telling me.

79
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,032
There were so many.

80
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,785
Do I need your permission
to throw out my books?

81
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,788
You've studied so hard
to pursue a PhD degree.

82
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,623
You could become a professor one day.

83
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,041
Don't you feel sorry for me?

84
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,044
I hardly go outside
because I'm always studying.

85
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,713
I can't believe this.

86
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,756
Doctor, she's being so rebellious.

87
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,717
She won't listen to me and talks back.

88
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,136
She wasn't like this before.

89
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:53,139
Don't you think she needs to be tested?

90
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,811
She's perfectly normal.

91
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,441
From time to time, we see coma patients

92
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:06,444
who go through profound changes
after they wake up.

93
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:09,489
Perhaps, she experienced something magical

94
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,742
while she was in a coma
that we don't know about.

95
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:13,910
What?

96
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,287
What magical experience?

97
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,830
It's different for each person.

98
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,291
She can be discharged next week.

99
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,502
I'm rooting for you.

100
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:28,132
Oh my goodness.
Why is the doctor acting funny, too?

101
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,509
Was it something she ate?

102
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:55,701
How did this happen?

103
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:01,457
Thanks to my quick reflexes, I saved you
from getting your head cracked.

104
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,084
I saved your life and this is what I get?

105
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,544
What if I end up with a scar?

106
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,338
Se-jin will treat you so that
you won't have a scar. Don't worry.

107
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,673
Se-jin?

108
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,551
What did you do yesterday with her?

109
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,178
You said you'd do all of that
with her later. Why can't you wait?

110
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,347
Someone naive like you wouldn't know.

111
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,391
It's not something you can resist.

112
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,685
Can you let me have another go at it?

113
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,648
Should I change the curtains?

114
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,567
With or without patterns?

115
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,654
What color should I pick? Beige or pink?

116
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,864
What do you think, sweetie?

117
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,326
What? You're asking me what I like?

118
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,036
I like it, of course.

119
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,332
He did it again?
Why doesn't he look after your body?

120
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,375
He's so reckless.

121
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:48,838
I know, right? He's inconsiderate.
He was like that when I first met him.

122
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:51,716
Seung-tak.

123
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:04,270
He suggests grey, blackout curtains
without any patterns.

124
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,772
I was leaning towards that, too.

125
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,109
We have similar tastes.

126
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,193
Same wavelength.

127
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,738
I'm hungry. Treat me to lunch.

128
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,240
Lunch? Why would I treat you?

129
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:19,660
You said I'll die if I skip meals.
You might end up killing me.

130
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,204
Can't let you die.
What do you want for lunch?

131
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,081
A steak.

132
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,916
Seung-tak.

133
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,627
Seung-tak.

134
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,547
He likes to listen to songs
on the top 100 K-pop charts

135
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,759
instead of classical music or pop.

136
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:37,136
Right. I forgot. He liked K-pop.

137
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,472
I'll play him Jessica songs.

138
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,726
All right. Her new album is doing well.

139
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,813
Instead of a goose-down comforter,

140
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,816
he said a light cotton blanket
will be fine.

141
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,110
He would like it in red.

142
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:54,904
I didn't ask for red.

143
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,657
That's right. The cold doesn't bother him.

144
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,408
I'll get him a cotton blanket.

145
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,743
That'll be perfect.

146
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:01,994
And get it in blue.

147
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,830
Where did your old attitude go?

148
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,669
Hey, I'm sensitive lately.

149
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,630
I didn't return to the hospital
to do these kinds of errands.

150
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,341
Seung-tak, now wait a minute.

151
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,843
It's time for lunch.

152
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,515
You look so content and happy these days.

153
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,769
Not too long ago,
you were so stressed and on edge.

154
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,272
It's thanks
to the administrative director.

155
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,985
He's been looking after Seung-tak
more than I have.

156
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,487
He's so patient with him.

157
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,198
I'm very grateful.

158
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:42,159
It's wonderful that Seung-tak
has such a fine cousin.

159
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:49,291
By the way, Dad. Have you seen
the hospital rankings report?

160
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,461
Our hospital rose a lot.

161
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,923
I think we'll be in the top five soon.

162
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,635
We owe it to the hospital staff.
They worked really hard.

163
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:04,473
Talented doctors comprise the heart
and lungs of our hospital.

164
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:09,728
Without blood vessels,
how can the heart and lungs function well?

165
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:16,569
The hospital administration ensures
that everything runs smoothly.

166
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,530
I am enjoying this chat.

167
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,491
Have you been taking classes lately?

168
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,995
My gosh.

169
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,330
I could always keep a conversation going.

170
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,541
I'm well-read, you know.

171
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,378
Just eat your food.

172
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,755
Stop spewing thoughtless words.

173
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,555
I can eat alone.
Don't bother Seung-tak so much.

174
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,140
Seung-tak said he's hungry, too.

175
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,641
Have some marinated pork.

176
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:52,271
Young-min, eat a lot. I'm fine.

177
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,940
Seung-tak is on a diet. So eat all of it.

178
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,443
Have this omelet.

179
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,488
Gosh.

180
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,739
Hey.

181
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,992
I was wondering about them.
What's going on?

182
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,077
You know, don't you?

183
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,830
How would I know?

184
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,625
You're always so curious.

185
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,294
You don't have to get upset.

186
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,464
We could have gone out.
It's a nice day, after all.

187
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,882
It's dangerous to go out.

188
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,384
My half-brother might be watching you.

189
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,553
Min-ho, that bastard.

190
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,722
I'll beat him to a pulp.

191
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,057
You are doing it again.

192
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,434
Don't use your hands
to get revenge on a scumbag.

193
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,228
Your precious hands
are meant for saving lives.

194
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,650
You'll be handling
your own operation yourself, right?

195
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,735
What? The operation?

196
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:43,239
I don’t trust anyone except you.
You have to do it. That's why I came.

197
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,992
-You know that, right?
-Yes, I know.

198
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,880
Did you reschedule Dr. Cha's operation
after it was delayed?

199
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,635
He's still being treated for pneumonia.

200
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:05,803
Really?

201
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,764
That's taking longer than I expected.

202
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,184
Will Dr. Ban be handling the operation?

203
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,105
Yes, I think so.

204
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,732
He needs to do it successfully

205
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,028
to justify leaving Dr. Cha's position
vacant this long.

206
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,631
LEGAL TEAM LEADER

207
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,471
Find out something for me.

208
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,982
Dr. did you just slap
Young-min on the back?

209
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,359
It was Dr. Cha?
I thought it was Seung-tak.

210
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,196
I think you knew it was Young-min.
You slapped him hard.

211
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,991
No, I didn't. I've got a hard slap.

212
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,411
-Soo-jung.
-But it's Seung-tak's body, isn't it?

213
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,913
Only Seung-tak would feel it.

214
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,915
But Young-min was inside.

215
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:16,916
Did that hurt, sweetie?

216
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,586
Your sweetie is here.

217
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,379
Aren't you taking advantage
of my friend too much?

218
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,339
What?

219
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,342
-Are you talking about me?
-He's getting an operation soon.

220
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,593
Can't you give me time with him?

221
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,804
If you don't like it,
then I'll stop, Dr. Oh.

222
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,226
I've heard that from somewhere before.

223
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,812
It's hard to say no. I understand.

224
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,739
Since you didn't have lunch yet
because of me, this is my treat.

225
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,032
Enjoy it with Dr. Koh.

226
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,409
I told you that
Seung-tak doesn't eat chicken

227
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,619
because he got sick once.

228
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:57,247
I forgot. Last time we ate,
Young-min loved it.

229
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,043
You fed him chicken?

230
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,213
-I ate chicken?
-What?

231
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,799
Yes, I didn't get sick.

232
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,635
That's true. Why didn't I get sick?

233
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,720
How about we set some rules?

234
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,305
That's a good idea.

235
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,600
-You can have him for one hour a day.
-That's too little. Two hours.

236
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,311
Then let's limit the frequency.
Just once per day.

237
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,980
No, that's not fair. Three times.

238
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,773
That's too frequent.

239
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,233
-What do you think, Sweetie?
-What do you think?

240
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,318
-This tastes good.
-Hey.

241
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,695
-Isn't this good?
-Yes.

242
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:29,738
He likes it.

243
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,073
Eat more.

244
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,743
-Dr. Cha is eating it with me.
-Dr. Koh is behaving differently.

245
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,161
Differently?

246
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,748
-How so?
-I checked his work schedule.

247
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,626
And he hasn't done any surgeries lately.

248
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,961
Neither has he done
any emergency surgeries.

249
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,296
So he goes in
but doesn't do any surgeries.

250
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,798
Then what is he doing?

251
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,302
Why didn't you wake me up?
I had to do my morning rounds.

252
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,180
-But Dr. Koh already did it.
-What?

253
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,140
Dr. Koh did it?

254
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,517
-Again?
-He checked their vitals

255
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,810
and changed the dressings.

256
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,021
He even administered injections himself.

257
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,106
He's gone crazy.

258
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,818
-What's wrong? Who's gone crazy?
-I mean Seung-tak.

259
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,445
He's behaving very strangely.

260
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:13,323
Why is he doing treatments
that he shunned during his internship?

261
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,617
Am I the only one who thinks so?

262
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,038
I found it strange, too. He's different.

263
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,540
Right? It's not like he's acting
like his normal self either.

264
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,835
I've never seen him
behave like this before.

265
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,463
Then what about Dr. Cha's operation?

266
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,388
What's wrong?
Is there something concerning?

267
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,724
His white blood cell count went up.

268
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,809
His CRP and procalcitonin levels, too.

269
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,394
Is it pneumonia then?

270
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,189
No, it can't be. That can't happen.

271
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,983
-Let's do another sputum culture.
-Okay.

272
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,403
I thought he was getting better.
Not again.

273
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,572
He'll get better.

274
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,324
He has to.

275
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:12,007
You'll be handling your operation, right?

276
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,510
I don’t trust anyone except you.
You have to do it.

277
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,209
Seung-tak must have worked all night.

278
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,548
I didn't mean to wake you up.
Go back to napping.

279
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,216
I fell asleep.

280
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,427
-What time is it?
-If you're awake, let's talk.

281
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,097
-About my operation…
-I'm hungry.

282
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:05,060
I hope they're serving pork cutlet
at the cafeteria today.

283
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:06,979
Seung-tak.

284
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,356
Can't you hear me?

285
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:13,068
Maybe not. It's a nice day
so maybe I'll go out for lunch.

286
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,405
Can't you see me, Seung-tak?
Can't you hear me?

287
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,158
I need to get there early.

288
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,951
Seung-tak.

289
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,745
What's going on, Seung-tak?

290
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,123
You can't hear my voice? You can't see me?

291
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,750
This can't be happening.
Why can't he see me?

292
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,419
Where is Soo-jung?

293
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,424
Seung-tak.

294
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,343
Seung-tak.

295
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,026
Why you punk! You were faking it.

296
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,278
You've been calling me at all hours,
so I got fed up.

297
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,529
But still. You scared me there.

298
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,699
Seung-tak. I was looking for you.

299
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,035
Can you take a look at this patient?

300
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:06,288
He arrived unconscious.
I don't know why he's unresponsive.

301
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,916
His electro and chemical results
look normal.

302
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,793
His CT brain scan and chest X-ray
look clean, too.

303
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,714
How can I examine a patient like this?

304
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,592
I forgot. You're not yourself anymore.

305
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,802
You've lost your touch.

306
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,721
I saved an ER patient last time.
You saw me do it.

307
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,557
See these hands?
These are life-saving hands.

308
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,229
Seung-tak, catch him!

309
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,647
Catch him!

310
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,899
Come here.

311
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:34,858
Hey, Seung-tak.

312
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,489
Hey, ghost. Come back here. Come back.

313
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,660
It's okay. Come to me.

314
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,203
What is it? Why do you have to catch him?

315
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,082
It's so noisy. Gosh.

316
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,376
What's going on there?

317
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,505
You really have to ask?
I'll punch you there. You…

318
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,674
They're trying to save a patient.

319
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:03,053
They have to do legwork
because they can't figure it out.

320
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,681
Dr. Cha is working hard till the very end.

321
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,100
He'll soon join the living.
He's getting an operation.

322
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,020
I'm not sure.

323
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,232
The situation is so unpredictable.

324
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,777
I don't know how it'll turn out.

325
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,365
Come back here.

326
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,458
That's your boundary I see.

327
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,712
Do I have to chase down ghosts?

328
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,714
Why are you chasing him anyway?

329
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,049
You have to save the patient.
You're going to let him die?

330
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,097
Who are you?

331
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,349
Why are you chasing me?

332
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,727
And who is this doctor?

333
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,478
Is he a ghost, too?

334
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,522
He's a living person.

335
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:58,150
He's the only doctor who can save you.

336
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,323
Give him 2mg of naloxone.

337
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,908
Naloxone? Why?

338
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,328
-He did drugs. This patient.
-Drugs?

339
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,246
-What kind?
-Fentanyl.

340
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,582
He's been abusing it illegally.

341
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,001
He has? Who told you?

342
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,670
-Himself.
-Himself?

343
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,339
You know him?

344
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,590
I wish I didn't know him.

345
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,343
Hold on.

346
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,970
-Don't administer it yet.
-Why not?

347
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:31,767
If I wake up after the injection,
will I be arrested?

348
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,019
Will you report me?

349
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,854
Inject it.

350
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,023
-Wait.
-Hold it.

351
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,858
What now?

352
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,652
Promise that you won't do drugs again
after you wake up.

353
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,530
That's pointless. He won't remember this
once he wakes up.

354
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,658
Just inject it. We'll call the police
when he wakes up.

355
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,879
The patient woke up.
And the cops will be here.

356
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,715
You saved a patient despite not being able
to do surgeries.

357
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:07,302
Surgery is not everything
that a doctor can do.

358
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,221
It wasn't me who saved him.

359
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,224
You saved the patient.

360
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,018
Being a ghost has its benefits.

361
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,229
I'm able to save a patient
that others can't.

362
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:21,608
Consider your ability to see ghosts
as a gift, not a curse.

363
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,193
It's your special ability.

364
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:27,155
They're not general spirits,
eight fairies, or lowly demons.

365
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,657
They're patients who need help.

366
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:35,205
It was Chairman Jang's last request.

367
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,583
He asked me to grant them their wishes.

368
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,710
They each have their own grudges
and situations.

369
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:46,383
It won't be easy but do that for them.
It's your duty now.

370
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:51,012
Sounds like you're making
your last wish before dying.

371
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,348
Do you have to put it that way?

372
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:57,018
I'm saying it now
because I might forget it later.

373
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,106
Your operation…

374
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,609
Weren't you going to talk about that?

375
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,489
We can't do it.

376
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,448
Got it?

377
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,702
I told you before.

378
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,287
It's not a complicated procedure.

379
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,415
The doctors here are not amateurs.

380
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:25,714
Isn't today the day we'll get
Hoon-gil's CT brain scan results?

381
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,048
Hurry. Let's get it.

382
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,886
He said he had all the time in the world.

383
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,723
It's hard to join Soo-jung for lunch.

384
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,064
Why isn't she here yet?

385
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,488
Mom, let's have lunch together.

386
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,407
I reserved a table
at your favorite restaurant.

387
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,700
I'll see you at 12. Don't miss it.

388
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,161
She read it but didn't reply.

389
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:11,092
It's her birthday
but she won't let me treat her to lunch.

390
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,934
I see hydrocephalus.

391
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:23,104
When you compare the scan
from the one taken three years ago,

392
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,857
you'll see that the cerebral ventricle
is enlarged.

393
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,525
That means there's fluid.

394
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,027
It's cerebrospinal fluid.

395
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,279
How can it be treated?

396
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,739
Through a shunt.

397
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,033
You insert a shunt into the head
and all the way to the abdomen.

398
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,368
It's complicated.

399
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:39,287
But he can improve if we remove the fluid.

400
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:44,960
Was it there before? Did I miss it?

401
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:49,172
Was it there before?

402
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,133
In the scans taken after the operation,

403
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,302
it was too faint to detect.

404
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,388
In addition, the patient suffered
cerebral hemorrhaging.

405
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:58,306
And the bleeding tapered off.

406
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:02,477
So any doctor would have taken
a wait-and-see approach.

407
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:07,148
The patient's condition deteriorated
due to the fluid buildup.

408
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,237
Even if a doctor does the best he can do,

409
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,949
there can be unexpected outcomes.
That comes with the job.

410
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:19,327
Like this forgotten brain scan
he took three years ago.

411
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,829
It's a stroke of luck.

412
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,248
Without that scan,
we might have missed it.

413
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:27,377
Let's hurry and tell him.

414
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,045
Hey, thank her first.

415
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,089
He has no manners.

416
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,520
What is this?

417
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,734
Send it to the lab right away.
Tell them we need the results urgently.

418
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:51,943
We'll do a CT scan

419
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,778
-after I see the results.
-Okay, Doctor.

420
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,042
Dr. Cha. I heard you found the problem.

421
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,836
That's so good to hear.

422
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,971
What? They're moving him already?

423
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,557
To the neurology department?

424
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,976
No, not yet.
They're moving him to another room.

425
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,437
-Why?
-His parents came to see him.

426
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,689
But why did they have to move him first?

427
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,443
I'll check on him.
Have him transferred to neurology.

428
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,947
You've suffered so much, haven't you?

429
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:43,078
Hang in there.

430
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:47,457
I'll never give up on you.

431
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,541
Focus on the mother.

432
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,126
Take a close-up shot of her.

433
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,004
Mr. Kim, please write
a nice article for us.

434
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,255
Yes, I will.

435
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,674
Senator, don't worry too much.

436
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,760
-Thank you.
-We'll be going now.

437
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,353
Why did they take so long?
It's just for a short news article.

438
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,729
I'm exhausted.

439
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,482
Why did you go overboard with your acting?
It wasn't a video.

440
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:16,277
Gosh. You're accusing me of acting?

441
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:20,281
It was your idea to run this article

442
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,951
to help your presidential run.

443
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:27,288
All presidential hopefuls
go through public scrutiny.

444
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,254
Let's go.

445
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,357
I'll have an iced Americano.

446
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,984
With extra ice.

447
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,195
I'll have a grapefruit-orange juice.

448
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,366
Could I also have
a grapefruit-orange juice?

449
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,577
And a mango banana latte.

450
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,413
Add a mango banana latte to that.

451
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:12,000
And that, too. The one with chocolate.
All of them!

452
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,878
Do ghosts also have low blood sugar?

453
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:20,091
Well, it's because some guy
wouldn't eat lunch with my granddaughter.

454
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:25,930
Excuse me. I'll have that and that.

455
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,099
Hey, let me have your credit card.

456
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,519
-What?
-I saved your life, you punk.

457
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,771
I'll punch you.

458
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:35,607
Can I have my card back?

459
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,694
And put the credit card

460
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:43,281
underneath the vending machine
in the break room.

461
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,742
And treat my granddaughter well.

462
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,952
I'll punch you in the throat.

463
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,580
You're dodging?
What's your credit card limit?

464
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:12,811
Hoon-gil!

465
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,232
What do you think you're doing?

466
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,901
Come down from there. Come down slowly.

467
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,695
I know it hurts.

468
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,323
But you shouldn't choose
to end your precious life over this.

469
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,908
Come down. Hurry down here.

470
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:34,916
I forgot that you're a ghost.

471
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,085
Come down, anyway.

472
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:38,920
What are you doing there?

473
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,255
I don't want surgery.

474
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,674
-What?
-Just let me die.

475
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:45,093
There's no one waiting for me
if I were to wake up.

476
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,310
My life isn't precious.

477
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,064
You said you didn't understand
why we clung to life.

478
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,651
I have a pretty depressing life.
So I'll just let it all go.

479
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:05,780
"I wonder why they're
holding on so desperately?"

480
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,073
You don't know us.

481
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,493
What makes you better than us?

482
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,831
Yes, I don't know you. How could I?

483
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,417
What life you had…

484
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,128
And why do I need to know about that?

485
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:26,426
I found out a few things about you
since then.

486
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,970
He's got a lot of years ahead of him.

487
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:33,016
His dream is to be an actor.

488
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:37,103
There's a dying patient
who worries more about you than himself.

489
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,273
I want to save these patients.

490
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,233
If I can.

491
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:45,653
There's a young doctor
who overcame trauma and wants to save you.

492
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,406
-I'm going to die, right?
-His blood oxygen levels are rising.

493
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,824
His pulse is falling.

494
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,496
You don't want to die.
I know you want to live.

495
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,957
Why are you acting like this?

496
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:58,917
Back then…

497
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,548
Since when did you care
about your patients?

498
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,676
You said we were hopeless cases
and neglected to treat us.

499
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,929
Now you're acting
like you're a good doctor.

500
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,014
Quit pretending. That's not who you are.

501
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,602
You're right.

502
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,439
I said the prognosis was hopeless.

503
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,733
I neglected you.

504
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:26,361
So others are doing their best

505
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,404
to save you when I failed you.

506
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:31,866
To you, I'm a doctor who
screened patients based on their worth.

507
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,118
Whether they were worth saving.

508
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,747
Whether their family would be happy
if they got well.

509
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,959
In your opinion, I was a doctor
who saved those that pleaded for help

510
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,587
and let those who wanted to die just die.

511
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,465
But guess what?

512
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:50,843
The doctor who'll be operating on you
is not like me at all.

513
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,137
She cares deeply about her patients.

514
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,640
She's a compassionate doctor.

515
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:58,101
If you insist on dying,

516
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,560
I'll tell her to call it off.

517
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,771
What will it be?

518
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,564
Should I tell her to save you?

519
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,858
Or should I tell her
to let you die, Hoon-gil?

520
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,128
What would you like me to do?

521
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,172
Should I let him die

522
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,383
or save his life?

523
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,093
Your dad, I mean.

524
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,179
So this is what you ended up becoming.

525
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,440
I don’t just see any patient. Why?

526
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,150
Because other doctors
will make time to see them.

527
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,360
Are you in a bad mood because
you announced the TOD this morning?

528
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,195
Learn how to give the TOD.

529
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,781
I must go now and save a life.

530
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,992
There are two types of patients here.

531
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,869
Patients that were saved with these hands

532
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,871
and patients that can't be healed
even after I tried.

533
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:03,041
And if I can't fix a patient
that I operated on, then nobody can.

534
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,376
They are such patients.

535
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,172
You bastard…

536
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,631
You're not that special.

537
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,224
Someone asked me for a favor.

538
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,893
A favor? Someone?

539
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,061
Who?

540
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,062
Don't ask.

541
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,731
It's someone whose joy in life
is watching you.

542
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,985
He said I should treat you to this
to raise your blood sugar level.

543
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,361
He also took my credit card.

544
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,322
What are you saying?

545
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,159
-Are you joking with me?
-He'd kill me if I joked about this.

546
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:42,038
You better have them all.
Treat me to lunch tomorrow.

547
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,748
I have to go save patients. So bye.

548
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,668
How can I have all of this alone?

549
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:01,265
Despite it all, I want to live.

550
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:04,894
Not because I'm special.
But because I made promises.

551
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,562
And I have to keep them.

552
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,816
I'm scared that I won't be able
to keep my promises.

553
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,860
So you think hard before you answer me.

554
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,196
I don't have much time.

555
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:25,248
I told you I don't have time to see you.

556
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,584
Of course, I miss you.

557
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:32,463
But Bo-mi is asking questions.
So I have to stick around here.

558
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,799
I'm not marrying her out of love.

559
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,260
I told you this already.
Her family is loaded.

560
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,928
They own a lot of real estate.

561
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,639
Hey, hang up.

562
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,724
A lot of real estate?

563
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,476
I should punch you in the throat.

564
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,646
I can't punch him.

565
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:52,567
Why did you come out?
I was about to go in.

566
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,485
It's cold. You should wear something warm.

567
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,487
Wear this.

568
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,072
That's all right. I'm not cold.

569
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,785
You'll be discharged next week, right?

570
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,912
How about we go on a trip together?

571
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,914
I picked a few places we go to.

572
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,749
What? A trip?

573
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,713
I didn't go on purpose. So why?

574
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,674
Why did she send it by courier?

575
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,762
She's not making much as an intern.
This is too expensive.

576
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,644
Hello.

577
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,229
Welcome.

578
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,524
Is this the hair salon
that everybody is talking about?

579
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,609
Oh my. Hello.

580
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,861
What brings you here?

581
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:40,698
Well, I came to this barber… I mean…

582
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:43,910
So why did I come to the hair salon?

583
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,538
I'll pay double your rate.

584
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,335
What style do you want?

585
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,546
-A perm?
-A perm?

586
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,757
Yes. A perm, of course.

587
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,220
It's my first time getting a perm though.

588
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:08,893
-That looks nice. I want that hairstyle.
-Gosh.

589
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:11,479
That's a look for young women.

590
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:12,688
You mean I'm old?

591
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:15,399
Sit down.

592
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:17,777
Here?

593
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,738
Gosh.

594
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,745
Your daughter is still in ER, right?

595
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,665
That's why you're still pouting.

596
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,583
You know my daughter?

597
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,876
Of course.

598
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,797
She's the hardest working doctor in ER.

599
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,882
She's a wonderful person.

600
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,594
Why does she have to work so hard?

601
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,222
She's frail. I'm so upset.

602
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,015
Of course, it's upsetting.

603
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,017
Gosh. Sure you are.

604
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:55,022
Whenever I look at doctors,
I get so upset.

605
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,149
They all look pale.

606
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,277
And walk around like ghosts.

607
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,239
I don't understand
why anyone would want to live like that.

608
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:06,367
Don't get me started.

609
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:10,871
Don't say that money is all that matters.
I don't want to hear it.

610
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,458
What kind of doctor thinks like that?

611
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,297
Just let me do your hair.

612
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:34,979
It's quite peculiar.

613
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,734
She'll appear to be on the verge
of falling over with just a little nudge.

614
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:45,072
But when a patient comes,
she'll perk up and be energized.

615
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:52,413
She'll get giddy when a critical patient

616
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:57,918
she treated walks out cured.

617
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:02,506
That's how she'll become a good doctor.

618
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,593
That's what I was trying to be.

619
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:13,851
I've worked at the hospital for years,
so I've seen a lot.

620
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,106
You talk like an old lady.

621
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,319
I'll give you a pretty look.

622
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:24,487
A youthful one.

623
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,741
My daughter-in-law…

624
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:33,579
Take care of Soo-jung.

625
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,876
I'm so sorry for leaving you.

626
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,253
I'm grateful.

627
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,945
What is it? What happened to Dr. Cha?

628
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,991
He's here.

629
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:13,369
What's wrong?

630
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:16,622
His white blood cell count spiked
and sputum became purulent a few days ago.

631
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:17,748
Other tests show abnormal levels.

632
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:21,460
In a culture test, Carbapenem-resistant
pseudomonas was spreading.

633
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,337
You mean…

634
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,505
I think his pneumonia

635
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,091
has returned.

636
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,052
Do a chest CT scan.
Let's check the blood vessels.

637
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,595
Using a neck vessel extension.

638
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,732
Why? What do you see?

639
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,528
The innominate artery has narrowed.

640
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:49,864
That means…

641
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:53,617
I won't last that long.

642
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:00,875
Why is there another complication?
How could this constantly happen?

643
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,711
Seung-tak, that's enough.
Dr. Jang looks alarmed.

644
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,589
It's my fault.

645
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:09,133
Is it because of that time?

646
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,927
Dr. Koh, what about his operation?

647
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,806
You want to go ahead? Now?

648
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:21,270
In a CT scan, the reversible innominate
artery obstruction has become severe.

649
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:24,315
We can't delay his surgery any longer.

650
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:27,276
At this point,
going forward with the operation

651
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,112
would be much more complicated
than it was before.

652
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:33,157
It's no longer a simple procedure
on the innominate artery.

653
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,660
I agree. Operating on a patient
who has pneumonia

654
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,538
is risky because of any graft infections.

655
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,917
Waiting until his pneumonia clears
will be too late for the patient.

656
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,085
It's a dilemma.

657
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:48,339
We can't let Dr. Cha remain
in such a precarious condition.

658
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:49,298
Of course, not.

659
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,592
So we brainstormed other options

660
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,511
and we think
a bypass operation might work.

661
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,225
We need to fix
the blood flow problem, right?

662
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:01,519
We'll leave
the diseased innominate artery as is.

663
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:05,189
We'll connect the right
and left carotid arteries.

664
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:07,983
In that case, we'll just operate
on the neck, making it simpler.

665
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:10,528
Dr. Cha is not 40 yet.

666
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:14,114
I recall that you wanted
to fix the core problem thoroughly.

667
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,534
I know. Dr. Cha
is healthy and relatively young.

668
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:17,868
He hasn't married.

669
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,120
He loves tailored suits
but can't splurge on them.

670
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,497
We'd like to give that back to him.

671
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:24,291
But to fix the innominate artery,
we'll have to do open-chest surgery.

672
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:29,463
And that's reckless when he has pneumonia
and a high white blood cell count.

673
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,007
It's not Dr. Cha's first operation either.

674
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:35,261
Operating on the aorta is risky
and there's quite a lot of bleeding.

675
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:38,639
Using general anesthesia
on a coma patient is also dangerous.

676
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:41,016
Is it worth the risk to go ahead

677
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,102
with such an operation?

678
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:46,063
We can't guarantee that he'll wake up
after surgery.

679
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,107
He might not make it
through the operation…

680
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:54,822
Let's fix the blood flow first
by operating on his neck.

681
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:57,283
We should focus on saving his life.

682
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:04,248
How can those doctors
change their minds like that?

683
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:06,000
They don't want to take any blame.

684
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:09,420
They made valid points.
Their arguments were logical.

685
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:12,089
Whose side are you on? It's your body.

686
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:14,925
I'm talking from one doctor to another.

687
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:18,387
You agree to the bypass?

688
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,556
You'll live with a tube in your neck
for the rest of your life.

689
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:23,767
How will you speak and eat?
It'll be a big hassle.

690
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:27,354
Not to mention how your neck will look.
What about your marriage?

691
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,857
There's the constant risk
of tube blockage.

692
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,900
You'll be on medication until you die.

693
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:33,444
Will you do it?

694
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,698
The operation, I mean.

695
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:39,825
You asked me once.

696
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:44,371
Whether I'd let you operate on me.
Will you do the operation?

697
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,332
That's…

698
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:47,916
Go with the bypass.

699
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:55,924
I talked to Dr. Ban.
And I overheard you just now, Dr. Koh.

700
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:59,428
I think I know
what Young-min would say as a doctor.

701
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:00,387
Dr. Jang.

702
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,473
Young-min.

703
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:03,849
Answer one question.

704
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:07,978
You'll wake up from your coma
after bypass surgery, right?

705
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:10,689
You'll have to live with a tube
in your neck forever

706
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:14,652
and it could get blocked
and you'll be on drugs until you die.

707
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,530
But you can wake up, right?

708
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:21,075
Yes, I can.

709
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,243
-Dr. Cha.
-Seung-tak.

710
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,079
That's enough.

711
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,833
I'm his guardian. I'll make that decision.

712
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,335
I also have a say on this matter.

713
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,587
Regarding my duty to him.

714
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:38,175
Dr. Cha came this far.
I'm not going to let it end like this.

715
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,761
I'll find a doctor in Korea…

716
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:46,016
No, I'll search the whole world
for a doctor who can operate on Dr. Cha.

717
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,311
I'll never allow Dr. Cha
to live with a tube.

718
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,028
Yes, Dr. Ye Jin-woo.

719
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,990
He's attending a symposium overseas?

720
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:03,492
All right.

721
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:05,744
Hold on. Could I--

722
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,664
Damn it.

723
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,754
Hi, Yoo-min.

724
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:18,132
At your hospital…

725
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:21,969
Seung-tak is looking for a top surgeon
to operate on Dr. Cha.

726
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,555
No surgeon would do it.

727
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:27,057
The medical community knows
Dr. Cha is in a coma.

728
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,767
It's not an easy operation either.

729
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:31,228
One mistake and he could die.

730
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:36,275
You're telling me
that option is still on the table?

731
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:37,818
I'm saying it got easier.

732
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:40,529
I'll be talking to Dr. Ahn soon.

733
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,867
I'm curious about something.

734
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:49,163
Why are you obsessed
with getting rid of Dr. Cha?

735
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,708
I have some bad history with Dr. Cha
so I've got a reason.

736
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:55,752
But even if he wakes up,
he doesn't know about our plan.

737
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:58,922
Even if he knows, who would believe him?

738
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:01,758
Things are starting to pile up.

739
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:06,013
We have to get rid of him first
to get rid of the next target.

740
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,434
My cousin keeps changing.

741
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:13,937
What will you do about Dr. Ahn
once you no longer need him?

742
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,732
Isn't he a loose end?

743
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:20,235
There's no other witness or evidence.

744
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,070
We'll have to deal with that.

745
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:25,115
After we use him, we'll cut him loose.

746
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:34,750
CONSENT TO OPERATION

747
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:36,835
You're making the right decision.

748
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,755
We need to save him first.

749
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:42,799
You'll be the lead surgeon, Dr. Ban.

750
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,803
I might lack in other areas,
but bypass is my specialty.

751
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:50,390
People say I'm one
of the top three surgeons in bypass.

752
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,683
I'm embarrassed about it.

753
00:46:56,688 --> 00:47:00,192
I was very fond of Dr. Cha
ever since he joined the hospital.

754
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:03,362
I'm sad about one thing.

755
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:21,588
After he undergoes bypass surgery,
he'll lose strength in his hands.

756
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,800
You could call it a side effect.

757
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:28,345
As a doctor, Dr. Cha would operate
for ten hours or more.

758
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:30,681
I don't think it'll be possible

759
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:33,225
for him to do
complicated surgeries anymore.

760
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:43,193
Come on.

761
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:44,861
Dr. Cha.

762
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,865
Hoon-gil has something to tell you.

763
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:50,826
Hurry up.

764
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:52,119
Before you lose the chance.

765
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,788
Your operation has been scheduled.

766
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:56,039
On the same day as mine.

767
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,708
-What?
-I told you.

768
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,419
This time, your surgeon
won't be someone like me.

769
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,506
I apologize for what I said.

770
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,300
Could you forget it?

771
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:08,176
Don't take it personally.

772
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,557
I've heard that from somewhere before.

773
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,434
Dr. Cha, that's great news.

774
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:16,810
Wonderful.

775
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:18,103
Thanks. Bye.

776
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:32,159
After he undergoes bypass surgery,
he'll lose strength in his hands.

777
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,995
I don't think it'll be possible

778
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,581
for him to do
complicated surgeries anymore.

779
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,045
Doctor.

780
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,840
I have something to ask you.

781
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:51,511
How did you know I had a nosebleed
before I collapsed?

782
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:55,015
The nurses said you knew that
and found a cure.

783
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:58,769
A doctor told me.

784
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:02,064
He said that could be the case
and told me to run tests.

785
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,152
I'm so grateful to him.

786
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:09,655
He's a wonderful doctor.

787
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:13,825
Despite being sick himself,
he cares about other patients

788
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:16,703
because he's bound to duty.

789
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:42,145
He's a coma patient
and we think we can cure him.

790
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,230
Like we did with you.

791
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:45,357
The same doctor gave us a break.

792
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:48,860
That's nice to hear.

793
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:53,365
I hope his operation will help him
wake up. Like I did.

794
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:57,452
Why don't you tell that
to the patient yourself?

795
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:01,123
What? Me?

796
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:04,418
People talk to patients
while they're sleeping.

797
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:09,631
Most people think it doesn't help much.
But many patients can hear them.

798
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:30,485
Hello.

799
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:31,903
Mr. Choi Hoon-gil.

800
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,743
You're really good-looking.

801
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:44,249
My name is Lim Bo-mi.

802
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:51,381
I heard you'll get an operation soon.

803
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:54,384
I was in a coma for a long time like you.

804
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:57,304
But I woke up after an operation.
I'll be going home soon.

805
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:02,434
I hope you'll also get well, Hoon-gil.

806
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:07,105
Handsome Hoon-gil.

807
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:09,941
Wake up no matter what.

808
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:14,237
And reach your dreams.

809
00:51:58,532 --> 00:51:59,699
I'm so sorry.

810
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:03,829
If I had arrived
at the operating room sooner.

811
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:10,836
I'm probably the only patient
who ever received an apology

812
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:13,505
from a doctor
for not being able to save me.

813
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:16,508
Dr. Cha.

814
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:21,513
Do you know what I first saw
when I became a ghost?

815
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,267
What is happening?

816
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:33,108
Suture.

817
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:41,157
That day, Dr. Ban left
after finishing the procedure.

818
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:44,786
But the remaining surgeon made a blunder.

819
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:47,873
So I saw you run inside
from the next room to save me.

820
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:50,417
You tried your best.

821
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,960
You did what you could.

822
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,337
An aortic dissection

823
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,673
is a high-risk operation, you know.

824
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,676
But thanks to you, I didn't die.

825
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:02,345
I know I almost died
on the operating table.

826
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:06,600
My blood pressure had fallen so much
that you couldn't save my brain.

827
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:13,064
I've been a patient for so long
that I know all the medical terms.

828
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:18,069
I wasn't even your patient

829
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:21,865
but you spent days, trying to find a cure.

830
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:23,325
I saw how you cared.

831
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,410
That'll be all.

832
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:34,836
Whenever you visited the ICU,
you'd make a serious face.

833
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,058
Later on, you'd get angry.

834
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,895
That's how you react
when you can't save a patient.

835
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:53,146
You get upset.

836
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:00,487
I understood your frustration.

837
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,822
But it did hurt a little.

838
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:07,535
I'm sorry.

839
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,704
I developed a bad personality.

840
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:17,128
If you're sorry,
then can I ask for another favor?

841
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:22,050
After Hoon-gil wakes up
after his operation,

842
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:24,970
can you transfer me to another hospital?

843
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,431
I saw the ICU chart this morning.

844
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,601
I know how much you care.

845
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:34,479
But I see you can't find a cure.

846
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:37,774
Which means, there's no hope.

847
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:40,860
You're getting an operation too.

848
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,155
I don't want to be all alone again.

849
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:48,326
If I get transferred to a nursing hospital
near my home,

850
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,745
my family can visit me.

851
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:52,497
I'm hoping to

852
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:55,125
meet other ghosts there.

853
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:01,631
Besides Dr. Cha,
no other doctor can possibly do it.

854
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:05,510
It's impossible
to have Dr. Cha operate on himself.

855
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:07,387
This is tough.

856
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,931
When Seung-tak was on a roll,
I didn't know it.

857
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:12,684
But not having Dr. Cha around
is a big loss.

858
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:15,311
We're doing fewer surgeries lately.

859
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:20,525
Dr. Cha was a menacing figure,
but his skills were second to none.

860
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:25,697
After his bypass, he won't be able
to perform like he used to.

861
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:42,172
Thanks to you, we saved our snack shop.

862
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:44,049
That gives me great relief.

863
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:45,508
Thank you.

864
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:49,471
Dr. Cha,

865
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:53,600
If you ever meet a patient like me again,

866
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,977
do what you can to save them.

867
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:58,730
Save lots of patients.

868
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:21,544
I'm not going to let you lose
your surgical skills. No way.

869
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,588
But you'll become a talented surgeon soon.

870
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,508
I need a lot more training and experience.

871
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:28,176
You said you'd help me by my side.

872
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:29,761
All right. I have no choice then.

873
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:31,888
I'll have to save these hands of mine.

874
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:40,563
KOH SEUNG-TAK

875
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:13,304
You know who I am, right?

876
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:14,973
How would I know?

877
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:17,767
I can't trust you.

878
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:22,730
I can't figure out why you did that
when you're such a timid person.

879
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:27,235
Can you even live a normal life?

880
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:28,361
You got years ahead of you.

881
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:32,157
What are you talking about? What did I do?

882
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:35,702
You'll keep denying it?

883
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:40,707
Fine then. I didn't come
to talk about that.

884
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:43,209
You didn't?

885
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,211
Then what?

886
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,339
What would you have to talk to me about?

887
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:50,175
There is something.

888
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:51,634
It's about Dr. Cha.

889
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,846
CONSENT TO OPERATION

890
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,022
What?

891
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:06,024
Dr. Cha's operation?

892
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:10,487
You're asking me to operate on him?

893
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,739
Are you crazy? Does he know about this?

894
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:16,659
Is this

895
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:19,204
what Dr. Cha wants?

896
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:20,830
Yes, it is.

897
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:23,875
I asked for it.

898
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,009
Dr. Cha?

899
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:47,982
Let me have

900
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:52,362
-Dr. Cha's position.
-You want his position?

901
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:56,574
I think it's an appropriate request
after putting my career on the line.

902
00:58:58,159 --> 00:58:59,702
You look very serious.

903
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,747
I think you're determined this time.

904
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:05,792
When I injected Chairman Jang,
I committed an unspeakable act.

905
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,210
I pulled the trigger.

906
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:09,921
I got my hands dirty already.

907
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:12,674
Doing it again
won't make a big difference.

908
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:14,759
If you give me what I want,

909
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:16,886
I'll put an end

910
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:18,596
to this game.

911
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:24,644
I guess I saved
that position for you all along.

912
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:37,991
RESTRICTED ACCESS

913
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:08,062
What? Were you waiting for me?
Let me join you.

914
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:24,454
Administrative Director.

915
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:11,561
You can begin.

916
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:26,659
What are they doing?

917
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:27,678
Patient is Cha Young-min. Male, 38.

918
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:31,140
Suffering from a narrow right
innominate artery.

919
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:34,352
We will operate on the innominate artery.
It'll require opening the chest.

920
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:39,774
On the innominate artery itself?

921
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:41,317
Not a bypass?

922
01:03:49,116 --> 01:03:51,160
Shall we begin?

923
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:52,912
Scalpel.

924
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:44,463
Do you think he'll save Young-min?

925
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:47,800
Don't worry. A successful surgery
doesn't always lead to recovery.

926
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,635
No. I need to stay calm.

927
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:51,971
Please.

928
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:53,139
Please.

929
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:54,724
Nobody is here.

930
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:56,058
It's quiet.

931
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:59,770
It's rare for a person
to be able to leave this world

932
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:01,480
with their name emblazoned on a coat.

933
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:04,525
He'll come back no matter what.
The way he used to be.

934
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:06,569
Seung-tak. Thanks.

935
01:05:06,652 --> 01:05:09,363
From the day we met to this very moment.

936
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:17,288
