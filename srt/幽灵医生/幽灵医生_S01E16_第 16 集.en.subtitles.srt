1
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:32,532
Dr. Cha.

2
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:33,825
Why are you so surprised?

3
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,535
It's not the first time we've talked.

4
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,328
Why are you asking me to operate on you?

5
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:39,873
-How could you trust me?
-I've always trusted you.

6
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,542
Both as a person and a surgeon.

7
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:46,463
Although you did break
your oath as a doctor.

8
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,007
What's more important to you now?

9
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,967
You can improve what you lack
in surgical skills.

10
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,345
Now how do you recover
from breaking your oath?

11
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,056
You know what needs to be done.

12
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,390
But…

13
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,018
why are you asking me to do it
after all that?

14
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,729
You asked me to stop you. To save you.

15
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,607
Sometimes, when a doctor is about
to operate on a patient,

16
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,026
the patient dies on the operating table
before surgery even begins.

17
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:11,071
-Isn't that right?
-Don't make any mistakes this time.

18
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,907
Get the deed done swiftly.

19
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,500
I completely forgot about you.

20
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,961
You were the one who endangered

21
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,547
Chairman Jang's life.

22
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,803
Am I your target now?

23
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,679
You're going to do the deed

24
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,098
using a scalpel
while I'm on the operating table?

25
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,601
It would be simple.

26
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:47,232
One incision on the native blood vessel
and I'd die instantly.

27
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,572
You evil bastard.

28
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:58,785
Dr. Cha.

29
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,956
Stop me from doing this.

30
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,879
Save me.

31
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,846
No.

32
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,222
I can't do it.

33
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:22,225
Did you cause
the liquid food accident then as well?

34
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,977
Being a doctor means
you've always got blood on your hands.

35
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,854
And that blood

36
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,981
equates to a person's life,

37
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,107
which they depend on doctors to save.

38
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,068
They plead with us to save them.

39
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:35,155
The blood, flesh,
and bones we operate on every day

40
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,782
contain the life of a person.

41
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:41,244
Each life is precious and miraculous.

42
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,747
And after an operation,
you can wipe the blood clean.

43
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:50,128
But there is a kind of
blood you cannot wash away.

44
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,299
It's why you don't have the right
to wear a doctor's coat again.

45
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:55,925
You've changed.

46
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,679
You used to tell us that
only surgical skills matter in medicine.

47
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,097
Tae-hyun.

48
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:05,184
Dr. Ahn. Why couldn't you
trust me a little?

49
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,770
If you had been patient with me…

50
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:13,943
Operate on me.

51
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,487
It'll be the last chance
you'll get to touch blood.

52
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,699
Whether you choose to save or let me die,
that's up to you.

53
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,369
What are you talking about?

54
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,997
How could you allow Dr. Ahn
to operate on Young-min?

55
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,998
That's outrageous.

56
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,043
Dr. Koh, you know what he did.

57
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:30,960
I do.

58
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,463
He caused your father's death.

59
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,839
Then how could you?

60
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,133
Young-min is in a coma
because of him, too.

61
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,136
Dr. Cha is still alive
thanks to him though.

62
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,680
During Dr. Cha's tamponade operation,

63
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,475
Dr. Cha entered my body but was
kicked out in the middle of surgery.

64
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,394
I couldn't continue the surgery.

65
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:52,899
Dr. Cha almost died at that moment.
But Dr. Ahn came and saved him.

66
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,192
That was then.

67
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,736
But now we know his despicable actions.

68
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,696
Do you think he'll save Young-min?

69
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,823
-How can you trust him?
-I don't trust him.

70
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,784
I'm trusting Dr. Cha's wishes.

71
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,160
Not Dr. Ahn.

72
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,372
It's like what you said.

73
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:11,709
A miracle is 99% heaven's will
and the rest comes from human will.

74
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,337
You witnessed it yourself.

75
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,716
He'll come back to us.
To the way he used to be.

76
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,220
Because Dr. Cha has people to protect

77
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,264
and things he needs to seek.

78
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,118
There you are.

79
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,291
That's my name.

80
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,964
This was a new coat style 20 years ago.

81
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,591
But now it's old-fashioned.

82
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,552
You kept that for all these years?

83
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,928
Of course.

84
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:07,098
We're born with nothing in this world.

85
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:11,728
But we inherit things.

86
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:16,816
It's rare for a person
to be able to leave this world

87
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,318
with their name emblazoned on a coat.

88
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,824
What did you think of me
ever since I joined the hospital?

89
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,410
Why do you ask? You're curious?

90
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:33,041
You think you'll go back to your old ways
when you wake up?

91
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,627
I've possessed

92
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:42,383
different doctors over the years.

93
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,136
But there was one doctor

94
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,516
that got my attention.

95
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:56,189
I admired him for trying to beat the odds
and save patients.

96
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:01,986
On the other hand, he didn't care
how his patients felt.

97
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:08,284
At times, I felt he was too obsessed
with his surgical skills.

98
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,914
What's the point of telling you this?

99
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,832
You won't remember a thing…

100
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,627
when you wake up.

101
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,306
Young-min.

102
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,185
When you wake up,

103
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:38,272
don't forget to become a doctor who cares.

104
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,360
All right?

105
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,782
And be a good surgeon.

106
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,370
Let's not meet again.

107
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:11,431
Since we're not going to meet again,
I'll tell you something.

108
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,600
Tess wasn't short for Socrates.

109
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,521
It's Hippocrates.

110
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,723
It's an honor for you to see me off.

111
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,115
I can't walk with you to the door.

112
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,368
-You know that, right?
-Of course, I know.

113
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,829
The boundary is around here.

114
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,498
Mine is there.

115
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,586
I wonder if Mr. Ban
will feel less burdened now.

116
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,757
He had to leave in a hurry
in the middle of my operation

117
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,675
because his daughter got in an accident.

118
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:34,096
When he learned that my operation
didn't go well, he cried so much.

119
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,851
He insisted that the hospital let me stay.
That put him in an awkward situation.

120
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,771
So he's been tiptoeing
around the administration.

121
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,606
Is that so?

122
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,450
I told him not to come and see me off.

123
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,704
Bye.

124
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,123
Give me your autograph later.

125
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:09,382
I wonder if I'll ever be able to
watch a movie where he stars as the lead.

126
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,553
I might miss my ambulance.

127
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:17,723
It's the first time I'll be going outside
in two years. I can't wait.

128
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,143
See you around, Dr. Cha.

129
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,481
Wish you luck.

130
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:27,900
Have a good life.

131
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,194
Bye.

132
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,211
Bye.

133
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,088
Bye.

134
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,346
Goodbye.

135
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:06,480
Sorry I have to leave you behind.

136
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,206
CARDIOLOGY DEPARTMENT
DR. CHA YOUNG-MIN

137
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,239
Don't disappear before my eyes anymore.

138
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,618
I'll be seeing you in the living world.
As one doctor to another.

139
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:01,994
Treat me to lunch every day.
No night shifts.

140
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,204
I'm sure you'll do that.

141
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,998
I hope I'll forget all my memories of you.

142
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,751
After you wake up,
I hope you won't be your old self again.

143
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,629
Don't worry. I'll only be mean to you.
Hysterically.

144
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,965
Let's go. It's our last operation.
We need to do it beautifully.

145
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,010
It has to be perfect.
An operation that everyone will remember.

146
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,179
Let's go, Seung-tak.

147
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:37,530
Choi Hoon-gil. Male, 27.
We'll begin the VP shunt.

148
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,616
The point of entry will be
the abdomen area and Kocher's Point.

149
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,368
Duration is expected to be
between an hour and two hours.

150
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,120
Expected bleeding is 50 to 100.

151
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,204
Is that correct?

152
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:48,457
-Yes, it's correct.
-Then we'll begin. Scalpel.

153
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,777
I can't perform such a surgery.

154
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,614
How can I do an operation
that even senior doctors can't do?

155
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:02,948
I'm not asking you to do it.

156
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,534
Then what?

157
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,785
I'll be the lead surgeon.

158
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,329
You'll assist.

159
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:11,207
We did this procedure last year. Remember?

160
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,791
What if that were to happen?

161
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,960
If my hand shakes
in the middle of the operation

162
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:15,961
and we get separated.

163
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,421
I'll do my best to hang on.

164
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,215
If that happens, Dr. Ahn will step in.

165
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,383
He can handle this.

166
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,135
Do you think he'll do it?

167
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,679
He'll do it. I know him.

168
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,440
What are they doing?

169
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,078
It's Cha Young-min.

170
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,587
All right. I have no choice then.

171
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,673
I'll have to save these hands of mine.

172
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,175
A doctor not only thinks
about the patient's life

173
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,344
but also has to consider the patient's
life to make the best decision possible.

174
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,513
To protect what is precious
to that person.

175
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,181
I'm a patient and a doctor
at the same time.

176
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,643
I'll do what is best
for this patient as a doctor.

177
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,521
Patient is Cha Young-min. Male, 38.

178
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,022
Suffering from
a narrow right innominate artery.

179
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,525
We will operate on the innominate artery.

180
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,361
It'll require opening the chest.

181
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,367
On the innominate artery itself?
Not a bypass?

182
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,291
This patient is currently infected.

183
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,877
There'll be inflammation.

184
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,546
The tissue is friable,
so we need to be extra cautious,

185
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,715
-Tae-hyun.
-Yes, Doctor.

186
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,676
Shall we begin? Scalpel.

187
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,221
Give me the gauze.

188
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,015
Suction.

189
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,814
-Cut.
-Cut.

190
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,452
Found it.

191
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,621
It's here.

192
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,082
-Focus.
-What are the high-risk areas?

193
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,667
the Ones we have to watch out for.

194
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:04,380
When you attach the innominate artery
and stitch the native and graft.

195
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,800
If you slice the native,
then you have to go deeper.

196
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,636
Which makes it more complicated and risky.

197
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,430
If we don't succeed in stitching it…

198
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:15,557
It'll be a failure.

199
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,269
Focus.

200
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:22,356
We'll suture the graft
to the native vessel.

201
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,273
Prolene 8-0.

202
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,520
No.

203
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,700
I need to stay calm.

204
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,537
Doctor.

205
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,039
Got it.

206
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,708
Suction.

207
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,213
I can't see anything.

208
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,724
Stay calm. Don't panic.

209
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,022
Let's get a visual on it. Catheter. Hurry.

210
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,833
I have to find the suture point.

211
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,211
Fast.

212
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,091
I found it.

213
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,217
Prolene 8-0. Again.

214
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,829
Just a little more.

215
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:44,748
Please.

216
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,375
Please.

217
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:32,796
What's wrong with him?

218
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,013
Tae-hyun. Cut.

219
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,031
The surgery is over. Good job.

220
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,083
Dr. Koh, what's wrong?

221
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,001
What's going on?

222
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,258
Seung-tak, you do it.

223
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,427
Finish the surgery.

224
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,096
Are you crazy?

225
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,348
-How can I?
-You just have to suture it.

226
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,599
You can do that.

227
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,604
But still…

228
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,233
You've been practicing.

229
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,078
Space it evenly.

230
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,772
It's time you get some real practice.
You can do this.

231
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,486
You, punk. I'm entrusting myself to you.

232
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,905
I'll be by your side and help.

233
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,993
Are you just going to watch
and not do anything?

234
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:09,911
Should I let that jerk do it?

235
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,969
Get the wire ready.

236
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:51,161
Hold the wire near the front
and not the middle.

237
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,288
Good.

238
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:54,873
Perpendicular to the sternum.

239
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,209
That way, it'll work better.

240
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,721
Keep the space and depth precise.

241
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,640
If you don't do it right,
the patient will get hernia.

242
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,067
Punk.

243
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:25,237
I haven't gotten married yet.

244
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,697
If I get a keloid, that's on you.

245
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,746
Use the derma lock instead of the stapler.

246
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,914
Keep things clean.

247
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,375
I want a clean look.

248
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,301
Am I doing all right?

249
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,389
Yes, you're doing good.

250
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,727
Why didn't you tell me beforehand?
You caught me off guard.

251
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,022
Punk.

252
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,109
Consider it an honor

253
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,945
that I'm your first patient.

254
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,990
Why do I always have to be honored?

255
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,200
Seung-tak.

256
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:15,328
Thanks.

257
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,206
From the day we met

258
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,168
to this very moment.

259
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:36,766
It's over.

260
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,103
It's done.

261
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,229
Right?

262
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,658
Yes, it's done.

263
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,661
His heart rate is stable.
His blood pressure is not falling.

264
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,830
I think the operation is a success.

265
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,167
All right!

266
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,002
-Yes!
-Seung-tak did it!

267
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,505
Seung-tak did it!

268
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,506
He pulled it off!

269
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,635
Dr. Lee, good job. Good job, Dr. Kim.

270
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,178
Great going, Administrative Director.

271
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,984
RESTRICTED ACCESS

272
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,030
He's not here, right?
He's not pranking us, right?

273
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:32,948
He's disappeared, yes?

274
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:36,743
Hey, Seung-tak!

275
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,996
Is the operation over?
How did it go? Was it a success?

276
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,289
Intern.

277
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,375
Dr. Cha?

278
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,005
It's over and it went well.
Dr. Cha's spirit vanished.

279
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:52,175
He completely disappeared.

280
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:00,475
They actually beat heaven's will.

281
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:02,936
I'm proud of you.

282
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:10,402
Dr. Cha told me not to tell you
until you made it.

283
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:13,321
When you were up for a senior position,
Dr. Cha backed you.

284
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,491
But Director Han refused you.
For both applications.

285
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:18,868
Dr. Cha called
the administrative director out

286
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:22,539
for discriminating against you
because you went to a state school.

287
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,541
Each time Mr. Han gave him excuses.

288
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,793
Dr. Cha backed you even harder since then

289
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:30,005
so that you could get more surgeries
under your belt.

290
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:35,093
Dr. Cha has a warm side
underneath his cold personality.

291
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,268
What the hell?

292
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:44,936
Have you gone mad?

293
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,439
How could you betray me like this?

294
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:48,773
What did I do?

295
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,026
Who betrayed who?

296
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,611
-What?
-I said I'd get blood on my hands.

297
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:54,779
Which I did.

298
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,282
I said I would end it and I did.

299
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,784
What's wrong with a doctor
performing surgery on a patient?

300
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,245
You better watch it.

301
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:05,707
Don't worry.

302
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,586
A successful surgery
doesn't always lead to recovery.

303
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,255
He won't remember anything
after he wakes up.

304
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,592
As long as I stay quiet,
we're safe, right?

305
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,272
You're probably the only person
to ever operate on your own body.

306
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,442
Good job, Young-min.

307
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:33,985
You did great.

308
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,823
He has to wake up this time.

309
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,992
Yes, he will.

310
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,077
Don't worry.

311
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:47,248
I know you're a good surgeon,
but you can't predict this.

312
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,793
The operation went well but…

313
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:50,835
I'm 100 percent sure.

314
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,837
Trust these eyes. I've got 20/20 vision.

315
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:53,838
Vision?

316
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,256
Not your hands?

317
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,593
It'll take several days
until he regains consciousness.

318
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,303
He's been in a coma for months, after all.

319
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:05,642
He's been stressed a lot,
so he needs rest.

320
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,814
-He's so good-looking.
-I know.

321
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,482
-How can someone look that handsome?
-Is he in a boy band?

322
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:14,651
-Is he a celebrity?
-I think he is.

323
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,861
-That's why he's so cute.
-He's lovely to look at.

324
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,238
Look at him.

325
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:27,455
Welcome back to the real world.
You know who I am, right?

326
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,210
No recognition. It happened again.

327
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:39,676
He's the one who obtained the brain scan
from your past traffic accident.

328
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,886
Thanks to him, we got a breakthrough.

329
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,221
How did he know?

330
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:47,809
I usually don't say this
to anyone except to myself.

331
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,770
But your looks are on par with mine.

332
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,147
Like a celebrity.

333
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,817
You've been lying in bed for a long time.
You'll experience dizziness.

334
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,570
We'll monitor your condition
while you receive physical therapy.

335
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,488
You mustn't overexert yourself.

336
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,741
You'll have a full recovery
after a few months.

337
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,577
Thank you.

338
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:08,913
So they don't recognize you.

339
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,916
I'm used to it now. It happens frequently.

340
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,586
Young-min will act the same, I guess.

341
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,173
There's another person

342
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,341
who doesn't recognize me.

343
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,889
Doctor, I'm going to be discharged today.

344
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:28,016
Thank you for all you've done for me.

345
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,350
Congratulations.

346
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,561
I hope to see you looking
much better in your follow-up.

347
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:32,854
Sure, Doctor.

348
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,858
By the way, I'm going on a trip next week.

349
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,694
I'm going to take time
to search for myself

350
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,780
and think about my future.

351
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,740
Will you go with your fiance?

352
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,450
You shouldn't.

353
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,577
No, I'm going alone.

354
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,538
I'm reconsidering getting married to him.

355
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,541
That's a good idea.
I would suggest not marrying him.

356
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:57,086
All right. Have a nice trip.

357
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,630
Don't overexert yourself.

358
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,048
I won't, Doctor.

359
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:06,054
What happened to the coma patient
you operated on?

360
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,473
He's in Room 708.

361
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,321
I'm so glad he woke up.

362
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,281
He looks strangely familiar.

363
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,158
Have I met him before?

364
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,264
How dare you touch me?

365
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:52,976
I want a male doctor instead of a woman.

366
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,811
That stung. Gosh.

367
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,690
How dare you touch her like that.

368
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:02,694
She might be just an intern to you
but she's my precious daughter.

369
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:03,862
Mom, stop it.

370
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,406
What the hell? Let go of me!

371
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:07,699
All doctors are equal.

372
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:10,535
What difference does it make
whether she's male or female?

373
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,704
The patient is drunk. Once he gets sober…

374
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:16,708
Then treat him after he's sober.

375
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,877
Eat this lunch first.

376
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,297
-What?
-You need to be strong

377
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,215
to handle patients like that.

378
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:27,886
Drink this tonic and get stronger.

379
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,513
Become a respected doctor
so that patients will seek you out

380
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:33,641
and beg you to treat them. Understand?

381
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,059
Mom.

382
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:38,897
And sleep at home no matter what.

383
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,065
That way you can get better sleep.

384
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,026
Getting quality sleep is important.

385
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:45,737
You said heart surgeons need good stamina.

386
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:52,160
Mom, I knew you'd respect my decision
and support me.

387
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,663
Thanks, Mom. I'm so grateful.

388
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,168
Have this lunch.

389
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,422
I got up early to pack this big lunch
for you.

390
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,882
I'll eat it all.

391
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,425
I won't leave any leftovers.

392
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,264
-Ma'am.
-Ma'am.

393
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:15,767
Hi.

394
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,479
I like this a lot.

395
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,230
I made cucumber kimchi, so try that.

396
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,231
You like this.

397
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,566
I like it, too.

398
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,279
They got to her before I did.

399
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,531
When will I get to eat with her?

400
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:37,538
How come I don't have one picture
taken with him?

401
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:41,834
Spirits can't be photographed, I guess.

402
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,879
I should've made him write a letter.

403
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,467
What? What is this?

404
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,553
Is it recording?

405
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,890
Young-min, look at me.

406
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,309
Do I look like Seung-tak?

407
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,727
It's me, Young-min.

408
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,771
What? When did he record this?

409
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,272
I'm inside Seung-tak's body

410
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:08,987
and leaving this message to myself to see.

411
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,156
It'll be hard to believe.

412
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,658
I know.

413
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:16,244
You'll probably think Seung-tak
is playing a prank.

414
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,122
That's understandable.

415
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,500
Because you don't like Seung-tak.

416
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,840
This is quite awkward.

417
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:34,345
Remember the burgundy suit you bought
at a tailor's in Gangnam?

418
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,264
You bought it
on a six-month installment plan.

419
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,390
After wearing it once,

420
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,267
you wanted to return it
and told them you never wore it.

421
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,769
But they caught you in a lie.

422
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,689
There was a coffee stain on it.

423
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:46,524
That's right.

424
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:49,193
It's an embarrassing incident
that nobody knows about.

425
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,195
Will you believe me now?

426
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,824
It's really me. Young-min.

427
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,034
It's me.

428
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,202
So…

429
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:01,205
listen carefully to what I'll be saying.

430
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:04,500
You were in a coma for many months.

431
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,545
Ask Seung-tak how you slipped into a coma.

432
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:11,007
He's bad at explaining things

433
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,301
but after gleaning the important points,
you'll figure it out.

434
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,511
Now, here's the important part.

435
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:20,058
You were a coma ghost
wandering around the hospital.

436
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,102
You didn't know if you would live or die.

437
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:27,774
It might come to you
as a frightening situation.

438
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:28,816
But it's all right.

439
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,736
When you're a ghost,
there are some positives to it.

440
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,529
You hear a lot of things.

441
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,241
And learn many new things.

442
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:39,577
However…

443
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,539
you won't remember anything
after you wake up.

444
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,001
So I'm going to tell you what happened.

445
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,253
It was the most difficult

446
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,881
and the most memorable three months

447
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,675
you've experienced in life.

448
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,138
You rekindled a relationship.

449
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,433
And made many promises.

450
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,645
I'll tell you what it was…

451
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,193
that compelled you to return.

452
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,953
There were special people around you.

453
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:25,248
And events that you can't forget.
I'll tell you about them.

454
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:34,132
Last but not least,
remember this, Young-min.

455
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,647
Young-min.

456
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,316
Are you awake, Young-min?

457
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,238
Do you recognize me?

458
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,913
Young-min, you're awake.

459
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,833
Young-min, you're back.

460
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,003
Thank you.

461
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,754
Thank you so much.

462
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:20,970
Dr. Cha, you're awake?

463
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,471
Is he awake?

464
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,098
You're awake.

465
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,686
I can feel his hand.

466
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,646
Look at this. I'm holding his hand.

467
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,358
You have soft hands.

468
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,446
Well, your hands didn't do any work.
It was mine that performed surgery.

469
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,325
Hey, punk.

470
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,577
What?

471
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,705
Get your hands off me.

472
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,294
And go away.

473
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,507
I'm a complete nobody to him?

474
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,969
Me? How could he?

475
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,894
-Doctor!
-Dr. Cha!

476
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:13,105
Doctor! We were so worried
that you wouldn't wake up.

477
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,191
-What a relief!
-Are you still weak?

478
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:16,901
I missed you so much.

479
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,194
You're awake, Doctor.

480
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,368
Are you awake, Doctor?

481
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:09,912
How are you feeling?

482
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,831
Hey, Sun-ho.

483
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,418
How long have I been in a coma?

484
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,086
Over three months.

485
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:18,963
Three months, you say?

486
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:25,469
I heard Dr. Ahn operated on me.
Why isn't he showing up?

487
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,346
He did it as a guest surgeon.

488
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,473
He left afterward.

489
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,809
A guest surgeon?
What are you talking about?

490
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,228
Did he quit? Why?

491
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:38,274
It's a long story.

492
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:40,860
By the way…

493
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:44,613
My patient, Chairman Jang.
How is he doing?

494
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,116
EUNSANG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

495
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:06,093
I bought you flowers since the ones here
started wilting. Nice, right?

496
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:16,020
Your leg muscles are very weak
since you've been lying in bed.

497
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,439
So take it easy for now.

498
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,441
You'll be able to walk after a day or two.

499
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:25,154
Se-jin, shouldn't you be in Seattle?

500
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,033
I'm sorry about your dad.

501
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,370
I wasn't able to save him.

502
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,833
I know you did your best.
It's not your fault, Young-min.

503
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,877
I heard you're here as a visiting doctor.

504
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:41,545
Is it because of me?

505
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,631
Why didn't you leave me
like you did before?

506
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,720
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm going to stay by your side.

507
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,640
You and I made a promise together.

508
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,645
You still think

509
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:01,399
I'm that dumb man you knew
12 years ago, right?

510
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,067
-Young-min.
-What?

511
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,069
Is it because

512
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,656
you've found out what an impressive
doctor I have become?

513
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:10,658
Or did you think

514
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:15,246
I'd welcome you back with open arms
no matter when you came?

515
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,213
Go back.

516
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:27,174
To America or wherever.
To where you belong.

517
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:53,033
If he can't remember,
I can just tell him everything.

518
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:54,910
It's not that hard.

519
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,134
What are you doing here?

520
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,845
I'm here to do the squeezing
and change your dressing.

521
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,388
I can do this now.

522
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,223
Hey, Punk.

523
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,894
I asked you twice what you're doing here.

524
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:23,189
I'm a doctor. Where else would I be?

525
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,399
And you'll soon learn
that I'm an excellent surgeon.

526
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,650
You'll be shocked.

527
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:31,447
You can't be that good.
I don't trust you. Call Dr. Kim.

528
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,242
I didn't want to show you this
so soon but…

529
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,244
-Hey, what is this?
-I don't know.

530
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,746
This will be awkward to watch.

531
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,998
What is this, Seung-tak?

532
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,629
All right. Got it.

533
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:49,632
He asked about Chairman Jang's condition
and where Dr. Ahn is.

534
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:52,468
He has no recollection
of the accident he was in.

535
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:54,345
He can't remember?

536
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:16,700
I'm glad to see you back
and recovering, Dr. Cha.

537
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,244
Congratulations.

538
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,746
You didn't have to come to visit me.

539
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,958
Of course, I had to come.
You're our best surgeon.

540
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,710
Do you know I elated I was when I heard

541
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:28,796
you woke up?

542
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,923
You've probably heard about Chairman Jang.

543
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:33,300
I'm sorry about that.

544
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,095
I know it'll weigh on you heavily.

545
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,347
But don't blame yourself.

546
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,474
You probably had your reasons
for being away.

547
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,560
You were in a car crash on your way back

548
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:44,979
to the hospital.

549
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:49,483
We settled it well with the family.

550
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:53,404
So don't dwell on it.
Just focus on your recovery.

551
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:57,992
This might sound too personal.
But I'm so relieved that you

552
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,786
woke up, Dr. Cha.

553
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,298
My chest hurts.

554
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,636
Why did you come empty-handed
if you're so thankful?

555
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,848
You should've brought
that bottle of champagne.

556
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,309
Han Seung-won.

557
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:27,646
I recall telling you to wait patiently
until I came to you.

558
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:30,107
I guess you were worried

559
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,026
seeing how you're here so soon.

560
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,113
Did you come to see
if I remembered anything?

561
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,158
And maybe to blame me

562
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,785
for Chairman Jang's death
if I knew too much?

563
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,788
How do you remember all of that?

564
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,624
That's a private matter.

565
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,836
What can you do about it?

566
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,797
Who'll trust someone
who just woke up from a coma?

567
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,091
Of course they won't.

568
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,302
Obviously.

569
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:01,430
But they'll trust the witness.

570
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:05,100
I told you before.

571
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:11,190
The truth will always come out.
If someone privy to your plans is alive.

572
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,276
By the way,

573
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,862
you should be thankful that I'm alive.

574
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:19,573
That's one less guilty sentence for you.

575
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:24,745
You'll have a lot of time
on your hands in prison.

576
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,413
So try to reform yourself there.

577
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:31,001
You'll feel the full brunt of the weight
of a person's life,

578
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,628
which you disregard so blatantly.

579
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,132
Get out. I'm sleepy.

580
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:55,901
He's scared out of his wits.

581
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,613
-It'll become a habit.
-What is this, Seung-tak?

582
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:01,698
What is this?

583
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:04,535
Do you see it?

584
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:07,996
The space is uneven.

585
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:12,209
I told you to do it cleanly.
Because I haven't gotten married yet.

586
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,920
That I'd be blaming you if I get a keloid.

587
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,299
And…

588
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,468
what are you still doing here?

589
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:24,847
I told you to observe surgeries
or be an assisting surgeon

590
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,515
at least once a day.

591
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,767
You're slacking off.

592
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:29,935
You said it yourself.

593
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:33,230
That you needed more practice
and real-life experience.

594
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,191
I sacrificed myself
to give you that experience.

595
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:39,403
So you should be trying harder.

596
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:41,864
Dr. Cha!

597
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,451
Doctor!

598
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,414
Don't grab me.
You didn't do that before so why now?

599
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:52,499
I can feel you. You're solid.

600
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,209
I got surgery there. Don't.

601
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:57,754
Why were you pranking me? How could you?

602
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:00,549
I told you not to bother the living.

603
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:02,009
You have to protect them.

604
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:09,308
Those two have moved the heavens.

605
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,310
What else will they accomplish?

606
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:14,605
Rules are meant to be broken, after all.

607
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,733
Whoever has the stronger will wins.

608
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:22,070
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached…

609
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:24,072
Why isn't he answering?

610
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,495
Yes?

611
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:32,873
-The police?
-Mr. Ahn Tae-hyun has confessed

612
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,834
to causing the death
of Chairman Jang Gwang-deok.

613
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:41,381
Under questioning, he said
you hired him to kill the chairman.

614
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,425
That is preposterous.

615
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:47,054
We have a witness and evidence.
So we need you to come in.

616
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,848
I suggest you come on your own.

617
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:52,100
If you refuse,
we'll issue an arrest warrant.

618
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,102
What evidence?

619
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:04,571
Let me have Dr. Cha's position.

620
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:08,367
When I injected Chairman Jang,
I committed an unspeakable act.

621
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:09,826
I pulled the trigger.

622
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,286
I got my hands dirty already.

623
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,956
Doing it again
won't make a big difference.

624
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:17,209
I guess I saved
that position for you all along.

625
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,131
Dr. Cha, I'm at the police station.

626
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:26,468
I was going to visit you
after you woke up from surgery.

627
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,304
I couldn't bring myself
to enter the hospital.

628
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,433
I felt too guilty, so I left.

629
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,728
I won't be able to
wash away the blood on my hands.

630
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:40,399
After I serve my sentence, I'll visit you.

631
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,777
I wish you a speedy recovery.
Stay healthy.

632
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:49,449
Thank you for trusting me
and giving me a second chance.

633
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,420
I will keep my promise
by not accepting any money.

634
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,716
I already filed a claim on my share
of the inheritance.

635
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:07,301
Once I get it, I'll donate it all.

636
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,886
You'll never get your share
of the inheritance.

637
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,431
I'll use every means possible
to block you.

638
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,267
You murdered our dad.

639
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,894
-As his daughter…
-I murdered who?

640
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:20,897
Murder?

641
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:24,109
Hey. I didn't kill Dad.

642
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:26,111
I didn't do anything with these hands.

643
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:29,823
Let's be honest. He only had
one more year left to live anyway.

644
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,576
Sending him to his grave painlessly
is showing mercy.

645
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:34,286
And…

646
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,872
you're the one who ended his life support.

647
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:39,958
Taking away even one day
of a person's life is murder.

648
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:41,543
Just one day

649
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,963
would have been enough time
for me to call him dad

650
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,590
instead of stating his time of death.

651
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:48,300
Even if Dad forgave you,

652
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:51,094
I can't forgive you.

653
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,225
We're the police. Mr. Jang Min-ho.

654
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:00,187
You're under arrest for hiring a person
to murder Jang Gwang-deok.

655
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,315
A qualified person
will occupy this position.

656
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:07,736
When your court date is decided,

657
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:10,530
let me know.

658
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:18,163
I'll walk with you there.

659
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,805
You have the right to remain silent.

660
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:37,766
-What the heck? I didn't murder anyone.
-You partially admitted to it

661
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:39,685
in your conversation with Ms. Jang.

662
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:41,687
There will be other charges, too.

663
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:45,399
For embezzlement and fraud
while you were vice president

664
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:48,652
of the Cheonmyung Group.
You also hired thugs to beat Mr. Koh.

665
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,028
Excuse me. Please continue.

666
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:53,824
What are these charges about?
Do you have evidence?

667
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:54,866
Where's the evidence?

668
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:58,787
Anything you say may be used against you
in a court of law.

669
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,997
You have the right to an attorney.

670
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,582
Let go of me!

671
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:11,925
What?

672
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,594
You're going to pile on me?

673
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:19,224
You weren't like this before, cousin.

674
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:21,101
I stand corrected.

675
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:24,312
You used to be a sore loser
and get back at people.

676
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,273
Why you!

677
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:29,192
You beat the kids who bullied me.

678
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,194
And fought the adults

679
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,781
who whispered about
how I caused my dad's death.

680
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:37,492
Back then

681
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:39,494
I really liked you.

682
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,082
It's true that I didn't want this
to happen to you.

683
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:46,418
I was hoping you'd repent

684
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:49,629
before Dr. Cha woke up from his coma.

685
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:50,881
But…

686
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,049
it's too late now, isn't it?

687
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:58,513
I'll welcome you back
no matter how long it takes.

688
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:01,349
I hope you'll become your old self again.

689
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,186
I'll wait for you to return.

690
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:25,183
You have broad shoulders I see.

691
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:28,019
-What are you doing?
-I just can't help touching you.

692
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:29,479
It's reassuring.

693
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,356
We had no physical connection
the whole time.

694
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:34,401
-This is nicer.
-Hey, keep your distance.

695
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:35,360
Get off me.

696
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,448
Be gentle. I have a stake
in your body, you know.

697
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:43,618
Hey, punk. How dare you touch me
before anyone else does?

698
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:46,663
You look disappointed, I see.
Is it because I'm not her?

699
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:47,998
Did I say that?

700
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:51,167
How long are you going to keep acting
in front of her?

701
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:52,752
I told you this before.

702
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,713
I'm going to start the relationship
all over again.

703
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:59,301
My way. It'll be much more romantic
and melodramatic with a touch of comedy.

704
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:01,887
People in romantic comedies
start as enemies and then fall in love.

705
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,305
There are misunderstandings
and maybe a little chase too.

706
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:07,309
In a plot twist, they come together
after a big fight.

707
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:08,768
We already did all of that.

708
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,855
So I was in a romantic comedy?

709
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:15,483
But where is Dr. Jang anyway?

710
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:16,860
Is she very busy?

711
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:19,237
Dr. Jang left for America a few days ago.

712
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,448
-She ended her visiting doctor term.
-What?

713
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:23,658
You didn't know? I thought you knew.

714
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:25,076
You told her to go back.

715
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,288
She really went because I said that?
Why didn't you stop her?

716
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,749
Of course, I tried.
I told her to be patient.

717
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,293
But she said she couldn't take it anymore.

718
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,420
She was very hurt.

719
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:38,924
What did you say to her? Never mind that.
Give me her address in America.

720
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:40,216
I forgot to ask.

721
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:42,260
You, punk!

722
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:43,637
She dumped you I see.

723
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,931
How will you be in a romantic comedy
without a partner?

724
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:48,016
You can't overexert yourself
after you're discharged, you know.

725
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:50,268
Especially, no long-distance flights.

726
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:52,938
Hey. Tell me her email
or social media account.

727
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:54,522
Hey.

728
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:56,775
Hey, Seung-tak.

729
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:00,737
-My chest.
-What?

730
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,155
-Hurry up and tell me.
-Gosh.

731
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:04,824
-Seung-tak.
-I've been around here too long.

732
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:08,328
It's time to let them take it over.

733
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:13,833
Watch over this hospital for me.

734
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:29,432
Mandu.

735
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,394
Mandu.

736
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:35,271
I was so worried about you.
You got here before I did.

737
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:36,815
Are you all right?

738
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:39,192
You do look healthy. You're fatter.

739
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:41,319
You left his pet at my home?

740
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:45,407
Yes. My mom kicked us out,
so your grandpa took care of his pet.

741
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:48,159
He's been living in the lap of luxury.

742
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,704
The squirrel daddy
and squirrel son are hardy survivors.

743
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:53,248
Father and son? Who's the dad?

744
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:54,958
Some guy. The master of rom-coms.

745
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:57,085
I'm famished. Treat me to lunch.

746
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:59,587
You're always asking me to buy you lunch.
You're richer than me.

747
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:02,257
Dr. Oh Soo-jung.

748
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:05,802
You applied to the cardiology department.

749
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:09,764
I used to study with these books.
You can have them.

750
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:11,558
Really?

751
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,018
Thank you, Dr. Lee.

752
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,937
If you need any help,
feel free to ask me anytime.

753
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,397
And if there's anything you need,
you know who to come to.

754
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,900
Do you have Kirklin's Cardiac Surgery
fourth edition?

755
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,402
I have it in my locker.

756
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:23,903
Do you want it now?

757
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,155
Yes.

758
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:26,322
Follow me.

759
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:34,581
Dr. Lee never did anything for anyone
the whole time I knew him.

760
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:36,458
Why that guy…

761
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,711
I can't believe what he just did.
I'm not having it.

762
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,547
Pretty doctor!

763
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:50,263
Are you busy, pretty doctor?
I have something to give you.

764
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:51,473
I'm not busy.

765
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:52,891
What is it?

766
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:54,768
Here.

767
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:59,481
Why are you giving this to me?

768
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:03,735
Chocolate cake.

769
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,490
I should've given it to you sooner.

770
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,160
I'm quite late, aren't I?

771
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,456
I'm sorry

772
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:18,875
for making you wait.

773
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,836
And I also want to thank you.

774
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:24,964
You've made me proud

775
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:28,093
by having grown into a pretty lady.

776
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:50,907
My pretty doctor.

777
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:54,494
Do what you want in life. Be happy.

778
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,663
Have a good life.

779
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:04,379
Even while I'm far away,

780
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,257
I'll be rooting for you.

781
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,889
And finish eating the cake.

782
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:19,644
Bye.

783
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:41,916
CARDIOLOGY DEPARTMENT
DR. OH JOO-MYUNG,

784
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:48,631
I've worn this for so long.

785
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:26,336
I'm grateful to see

786
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:30,131
how that little kid grew to be this big.

787
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,280
It's time to go.

788
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:15,885
How nice.

789
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:21,641
She said she'd be by my side
no matter how long it took.

790
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:26,563
I held her hand so many times.

791
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:28,231
And gave her hugs.

792
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,067
Why did she give me this ring?

793
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:33,695
REAL ESTATE LEASE AGREEMENT

794
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:37,282
Young-min is renting the place, I see.

795
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:46,207
He saved up a lot of money.

796
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:51,004
Seems like you didn't spend your money.

797
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:55,883
If we combine our funds,
we could buy an apartment.

798
00:59:57,969 --> 01:00:00,013
Your home appliances were all nice.

799
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,639
Should we buy some furniture then?

800
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:03,433
We'll redo the interior.

801
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:05,602
Let's pick out the wallpapers,
curtains, and blankets.

802
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:07,020
Together.

803
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,646
Se-jin.

804
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,944
Give me your answer after you wake up.

805
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:58,321
While looking at me

806
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:00,531
with your voice.

807
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:05,745
Whenever that will be.

808
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,413
No matter how long it takes.

809
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,625
I'll be waiting right here.

810
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,630
I'll have to go to America.
Or should I give it some time?

811
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:17,465
She might be waiting for me.

812
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:20,468
If I give in now,
then she'll have the upper hand forever.

813
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:23,971
But I'm the one who misses her.
So I should go.

814
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:27,392
Isn't that so? What do you think?
Say something.

815
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:28,976
Yes?

816
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:33,481
Who could that be?
I'm not expecting anyone.

817
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:39,821
You didn't change your passcode.

818
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:40,780
Hi.

819
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:43,282
Se-jin?

820
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,034
It's so cold outside.

821
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:48,079
How have you been? Are you feeling better?
You got home safely?

822
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:51,040
But what are you doing here?
Didn't you go to America?

823
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:53,167
I just got back.
I had to wrap things up there.

824
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:54,502
Dr. Koh didn't tell you?

825
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:55,920
What?

826
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:57,380
That punk.

827
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:59,590
My stuff will arrive in a few days.

828
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:02,009
There's some paperwork to do first
before I can start work.

829
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:03,386
Your stuff? What are you talking about?

830
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:05,054
I told you. I'm moving in.

831
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:08,141
The furniture you have is all right.

832
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,600
The furniture is all new.

833
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:11,602
But why are you staying here?

834
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:12,895
Should I stay at a hotel?

835
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,063
What? A hotel?

836
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,482
A hotel is all right? Is it?

837
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:19,861
I didn't get to eat
after getting off my flight.

838
01:02:19,944 --> 01:02:22,739
What? You haven't eaten anything?
This whole time?

839
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:23,865
Geez. Really!

840
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:25,700
Where's the rice?

841
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:28,411
I missed you every day.

842
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:31,414
I was running around furiously
to get back sooner.

843
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:35,752
Don't worry. Even if you don't
take me back, I can still love you.

844
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:39,422
I'll give you an outpouring of love.

845
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:49,265
Well, if you find it awkward,
then I'll stay at a hotel.

846
01:02:58,024 --> 01:02:59,108
Here's my answer.

847
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:03,237
Facing you with my voice.

848
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:32,642
You're showing up at work already?

849
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:35,812
Of course.
The hospital can't live without me.

850
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,647
You seem to be tougher than you look.

851
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,857
What does a heart surgeon need
most of all?

852
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:46,155
I can't wait.
I'm going to have an easy life now.

853
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:49,575
-Today is the first day.
-Seung-tak, do 100 squat reps.

854
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:52,453
-Record yourself and send the video.
-Let's start with a cup of coffee.

855
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:54,747
Seung-tak, you'll join me
in every operation I do.

856
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:55,915
You'll be on call for the patients.

857
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:58,000
For dinner, let's have a steak dinner.
Your treat.

858
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:00,211
Seung-tak, you'll write
all the conference reports

859
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:01,963
and organize the thesis papers.

860
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:05,883
Time to pay you back.
I'll be right by your side.

861
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:07,009
Hysterically.

862
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:12,306
You'll regret it.

863
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:17,854
Last but not least…

864
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:22,066
remember this,

865
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:24,402
Young-min.

866
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:31,367
One, two, three.

867
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:35,162
Dr. Cha.

868
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:37,748
The patient has a stab injury.
The knife went into his chest.

869
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:42,169
The knife went through
between rib two and rib three on the left.

870
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:43,921
Let's stop the bleeding
with a Foley balloon first.

871
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:45,882
Move the patient
to the operating room now, Seung-tak.

872
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:01,522
Remember this.

873
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:04,984
Every life is precious

874
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:08,195
just as much as yours is.

875
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,491
Scalpel.

876
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:17,830
-Suction.
-Suction.

877
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:26,797
Your hands can keep those lives

878
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:29,508
in this world a bit longer.

879
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:39,685
These are skilled hands, right? Admit it.

880
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:42,647
Hey, did you do the surgery? I did it.

881
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:44,815
You're standing too close to me.

882
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:47,944
Hey, I'm hungry. Let's have lunch.

883
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:54,283
And that's your job

884
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,953
on the border between life and death.

885
01:07:07,606 --> 01:07:10,192
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING GHOST DOCTOR

886
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:18,743
