1
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,782
It was actually Dr. Cha.

2
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,452
You mentioned it last time.

3
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:39,330
You said it was uncanny
how similar I was to Dr. Cha.

4
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:44,210
-Stop it.
-I'm not assuming Dr. Cha's persona.

5
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,296
Dr. Cha is inside of me.

6
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,839
I said shut up!

7
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,133
What?

8
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,136
What are you saying?

9
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,262
He'sâ€¦

10
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,227
right next to me.

11
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,313
He's looking at me angrily.

12
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,023
Don't say another word.

13
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,618
Dr. Koh.

14
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,040
Why are you doing this?

15
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,583
Can't you see that you're scaring her?

16
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,211
Step outside. Let's talk. You and me.

17
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,921
Act very naturally, okay?

18
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,672
Don't forget to say bye.

19
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,926
And despite his situation,
he's worried about you.

20
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,098
Shall I enter your body?

21
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,113
What was that?

22
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,740
How could you tell her
without discussing it with me?

23
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,576
You did the same. You did things
without discussing them with me.

24
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,078
And I apologized for that.

25
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,372
I tried to control myself, but I couldn't.

26
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,582
Because of Dr. Jang, you lose your temper.

27
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,708
That's right.

28
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:06,876
I regret it.

29
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,128
I did it for Dr. Jang too,

30
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:09,754
I might regret this later.

31
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,297
-What?
-Perhapsâ€¦

32
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,134
she's getting back at me in a way.

33
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:17,679
It could explain why she wants me
to keep my distance from her.

34
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:22,142
She has no idea when you'll wake up

35
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,727
as she stays by your bedside.

36
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,066
She blames herself for this
as she struggles to help you.

37
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,317
I felt sorry for her.

38
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,823
So?

39
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:41,494
Should I tell her I've become a spirit
that follows her around?

40
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,830
And that I enter your body at times?

41
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,500
You think she'll believe you
like Mr. Han did?

42
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,212
Why don't you consider
how confusing this is to her?

43
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:55,091
You want to tell her
how you feel, don't you?

44
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:56,801
It's the same with her.

45
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,304
I'll tell her myself.

46
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,848
I'll look into her eyes

47
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,309
and say it myself.

48
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,519
I'll wait.

49
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,187
And I'll tell her

50
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,315
all of my feelings

51
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,191
later on at once

52
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,192
myself.

53
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,069
You can't predict when you'll wake up.

54
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,530
-It doesn't matter.
-Your memories will be erased.

55
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,824
-We can just start over then.
-What if you'll never wake up?

56
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,994
Among the wandering spirits I saw
when I was eight,

57
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:26,623
most of them died and didn't wake up.

58
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:30,501
They would disappear all of a sudden.

59
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,712
It would happen when I least expected it.

60
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,715
They never got to say farewell

61
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,468
to their loved ones.

62
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,637
Soâ€¦

63
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,264
you're telling me to say my farewells

64
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,600
because I might die, too?

65
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,894
That's not what I said.

66
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:48,895
I know.

67
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,397
Pneumothorax, pneumonia, or sepsis.

68
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:55,276
You have one complication
and you can die right away.

69
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:57,820
Even if

70
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,782
I die and never wake upâ€¦

71
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,455
Seung-tak.

72
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,874
Do you know why a coma patient

73
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,294
can't remember anything?

74
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,547
Because he would lose his sanity

75
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,842
if he recalled his time as a spirit.

76
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:24,597
Being a spirit
shatters my sense of identity.

77
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:28,768
If Se-jin can remember things I forgot.

78
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,438
Or if I die like you just said.

79
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:37,443
I won't be able to bear it.
So how can she bear it?

80
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,530
To follow the natural order,

81
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,534
neither of us should know
or remember this.

82
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,119
There are rules in the real world

83
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,746
that have to be followed.

84
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,791
Who do you think you are?

85
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,918
You can't break those rules.

86
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:58,298
When somebody dies
without being able to bid farewell,

87
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,760
their loved ones will be crushed.

88
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,555
You know that better than most.

89
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,854
You believe in personal privacy.

90
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,190
You've crossed that line.

91
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,650
Don't cross it again.

92
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:26,159
You made this mess, you fix it.
You're good at making up excuses.

93
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,415
Dr. Koh. What did you mean earlier?

94
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,666
What were you saying?

95
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,295
Did I say something?

96
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,254
Why you, punk.

97
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:40,715
I don't remember.

98
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:45,344
I don't know what I said to you
but just forget it.

99
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,679
That's not a good excuse.

100
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,764
Hey, Dr. Koh!

101
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,688
I think I made a mistake
in thinking of you as a friend.

102
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,982
You were right.

103
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,276
Sometimes, I get confused
when I'm around you.

104
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,528
I thought that was my fault.

105
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,698
Because of my personal losses,
I'm going through a difficult time.

106
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,701
I'm grateful
for the help you gave me before.

107
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:12,663
I thought we were working together
in treating Dr. Koh.

108
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:17,210
Because I believed you truly cared
about Dr. Cha.

109
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,545
What is this?

110
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,132
You can't remember?
I should forget what you said?

111
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,179
Is this a joke to you?

112
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,224
A coma patient is a joke?

113
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:35,019
How could you say such things
about someone who is lying in a coma?

114
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,357
Dr. Jang.

115
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,691
Let me warn you.

116
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,653
Don't get involved
in any of Dr. Cha's treatments.

117
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,697
Don't come to his room ever again.

118
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,826
If you show up again,

119
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,954
I'll give you a piece of my mind

120
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,706
without any hesitation.

121
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,918
Got it?

122
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,385
What? Am I in trouble?

123
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:08,886
Yes, this is trouble.

124
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,763
I've seen this many times before.

125
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,099
When she gets angry,
she can be scarier than me.

126
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,184
You're in deep trouble now.

127
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,478
What now? She'll give me
a piece of her mind.

128
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,813
You'll have to face her.

129
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,441
Try apologizing until she accepts it.

130
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,943
Let's just tell her the truth, okay?

131
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,447
No, you don't. I said no to that.

132
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,754
He's right next to me.

133
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,798
He's looking at me angrily.

134
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,469
And despite his situation,
he's worried about you.

135
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,637
That bastard.

136
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,891
How could he joke around like that?

137
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,713
When somebody dies

138
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,008
without being able to bid farewell,

139
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,471
their loved ones will be crushed.

140
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,556
You know that better than most.

141
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:56,536
His friends were already there
when he got to his classroom.

142
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,287
He said hello to them.

143
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,249
Hi, I'm Ji-won.

144
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:02,792
What's your name?

145
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,253
Hi, I'm Seung-jo.

146
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,382
Do you know why a coma patient
can't remember anything?

147
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,802
Because he would lose his sanity

148
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,639
if he recalled his time as a spirit.

149
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,350
To follow the natural order,

150
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,812
neither of us should know
or remember this.

151
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,063
Who do you think you are?

152
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,815
You can't break those rules.

153
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,408
Are you okay now? Can you move your arms?

154
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,450
Like this?

155
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,369
Put it back on.

156
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:39,996
-That looks like a beanie.
-Hey.

157
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,873
Really.

158
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,129
Are you cold?

159
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,009
Forget all of it.

160
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,178
Forget everything and enjoy your life.

161
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,097
Be confident and speak your mind.

162
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,182
When did you get here?

163
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,201
Those were the good times.

164
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,245
I thought I was going to be rich.

165
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,874
My son, Joon-young.

166
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,544
I wonder how big he is now.

167
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,800
Why don't you come and visit me?

168
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,526
What? Are you scared?

169
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,112
You've done it before.
So why can't you do it?

170
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,075
But this is different.

171
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,078
Looks like you already forgot
what transpired.

172
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,747
I didn't touch a hair
on the chairman's head.

173
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,208
I was nowhere near him at the time.

174
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,627
You betrayed

175
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:11,837
Dr. Cha, not me.

176
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,467
Dr. Cha will wake up from his coma
if nothing is done about it.

177
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,888
Will you be able to face him then?

178
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:29,814
We started this together.
You have to see it to the end.

179
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,900
You need to get your medical career back.

180
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,152
Don't you?

181
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,019
Se-jin.

182
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,146
Se-jin!

183
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,023
Se-jin!

184
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,320
-We have a patient! Hurry!
-Seung-tak?

185
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,326
What happened to Dr. Jang?

186
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,995
Se-jin, wake up.

187
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,496
Se-jin.

188
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,998
Dr. Cha?

189
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,086
-Check her vitals.
-Okay.

190
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,053
CBC, electro.

191
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,847
-ABGA.
-Okay.

192
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,946
-Is it you?
-What?

193
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,781
Yes.

194
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,618
What am I doing here?

195
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,078
I was sleeping in the night-duty room.

196
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,583
Due to overwork and lack of sleep,
she has a cold.

197
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,376
She's also malnourished.

198
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,129
She was found lying on the floor.

199
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,965
Dr. Cha must've been frantic.
He didn't even wake me up first.

200
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,930
When he carried her here,
his face was ashen.

201
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,556
Dr. Cha is next to her, right?

202
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,810
Yeah, he can't take his eyes off of her.

203
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,649
What were you doing
when this was happening?

204
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,235
You told me to behave myself.

205
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,736
Exactly.

206
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,947
You should've brought her food
and taken turns with her.

207
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,740
You better start doing that.

208
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:47,743
Even a tough man will tumble
after caring for a patient for a few days.

209
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,828
She also sees patients during the day.

210
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,288
It's been months.

211
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,920
You don't need to explain
the relationship they have.

212
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,129
It's obvious.

213
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,103
We have to hurry a bit.

214
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,273
Could you get it done cleanly this time?

215
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,985
Don't forget to say goodbye.

216
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,290
I'm not forcing you to do it.

217
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,210
It's your choice to make, Dr. Ahn.

218
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,797
Whether you'll rot in prison

219
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:46,802
or be back working as a doctor here.

220
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,149
What a nice day.

221
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,861
It's perfect for a drive
while enjoying the foliage

222
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,530
and relaxing while getting fresh air.

223
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,158
Dr. Cha.

224
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,328
Let Dr. Jang have a normal life now.

225
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,184
CHA YOUNG-MIN

226
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,356
Nurse Jung.

227
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,608
Nurse Jung?

228
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,292
STAR IN THE SKY, JESSICA

229
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,004
He was really a fan.

230
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,355
Oh my gosh.

231
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,774
I think I'm dreaming again.

232
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,120
You're up.

233
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,329
You should sleep more.

234
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,999
Are you feeling better?

235
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,792
What is going on?

236
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,420
What are you doing here, Dr. Koh?

237
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,465
Did I cause this?

238
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,093
Maybe, I shouldn't have said that.

239
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,511
It's my fault.

240
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:57,182
Because I'm in a coma
and not waking up or dying.

241
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,475
Don't say that.

242
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,311
You just threw away all your happy
hormones with those words.

243
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,732
You're not recharging
because you can't do surgeries.

244
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:08,193
I need a favor.

245
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,822
I was worried that she'd collapse.

246
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:15,909
Don't worry too much.
I'll take her there somehow.

247
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,870
If she won't go, I'll force her.

248
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,706
I just need to stay
until she falls asleep, right?

249
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,834
This is the door code.
Thanks for doing this.

250
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,694
I just got here.

251
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,238
Nurse Jung had to go to work.

252
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,909
And I'm on a vacation.

253
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,911
Look here, Dr. Koh.

254
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,914
Can you save your outbursts
after you regain your strength?

255
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,373
Have some breakfast.

256
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,667
I warned you to stay away from me.

257
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,087
You're not taking me seriously.
Am I a joke to you?

258
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,005
What is going on right now?

259
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,757
It's not a joke.

260
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,843
Forget it. I'll leave.

261
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,097
Dr. Cha

262
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,266
wouldn't want that.

263
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,062
Look here.

264
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,857
He wouldn't like that you're tending
to him in such a state.

265
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,526
Dr. Koh, what do you know?

266
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,693
If I were Dr. Cha, I wouldn't like that.

267
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,864
Watching someone collapse
from exhaustion due to me.

268
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,910
Coming back to me regardless
in order to protect me.

269
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,620
"I would rather die."

270
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,789
"Would her life be better if I died?"

271
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,042
Perhaps, I would think like that.

272
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,418
Dr. Koh.

273
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:51,713
"Would I feel less guilty
if she could rest for a day

274
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,882
and replenish her energy?"

275
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:57,219
"I should wake up at least for her sake."

276
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,429
I think I'll cheer up with that thought.

277
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,311
I'm sorry

278
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,107
for what I said.

279
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,153
Never mind.

280
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,654
I don't want to talk about it.

281
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:16,864
I was merely speculating

282
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,950
how Dr. Cha would react.

283
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:24,955
How would he feel
if he saw you going through a tough time?

284
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:29,251
What would Dr. Cha do
if he could be present?

285
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,213
So I wanted to help a little.

286
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,639
I didn't want

287
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,517
to cause any trouble for you.

288
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:50,647
I know I overstepped the boundaries.

289
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,232
Thisâ€¦

290
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,194
won't happen again.

291
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,745
You know there's nobody next to him.

292
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,206
You know that.

293
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,389
Why is there a guard?

294
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,199
That's hot.

295
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,243
It's hot.

296
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,412
I'm not a good cook.
I tried my best though.

297
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,415
I haven't cooked at home in ages.

298
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,086
My cooking skills are rusty.

299
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:04,429
You cooked this with those hands?

300
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,347
What?

301
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,724
Well, yes.

302
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:13,438
It might not look appetizing
but it's actually good.

303
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,065
You like tofu, don't you?

304
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,234
And I made an omelet. Your favorite.

305
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,990
I'll get you a cup of water.

306
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,912
Why is this cracked?

307
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:31,915
I have a new one.

308
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,709
A new cup.

309
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,423
You know where everything
is in the kitchen.

310
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,800
As if you've lived here.

311
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:48,932
I came by often to see Dr. Cha.

312
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,768
You weren't on good terms with him.

313
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,772
We're in a love-hate relationship.

314
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,483
We're very close.

315
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,903
So I heard a lot about you, Dr. Jang.

316
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,993
Here. Have some.

317
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:29,097
You're going to leave already?

318
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,932
Rest some more.

319
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,435
I got enough sleep
and ate a nice breakfast.

320
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,187
I feel better. Bye.

321
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,189
Wait a minute.

322
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:43,028
How about you dedicate
the rest of the day to Dr. Cha?

323
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,822
Like the time you went to
the Jessica concert.

324
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,492
Do the favorite things Dr. Cha enjoyed.

325
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,620
I'm sure Dr. Cha would want that.

326
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,499
The floor is very slippery.

327
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,918
Be careful. You could fall on your face.

328
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:01,171
Oh, gosh.

329
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,673
What are you doing, Hoon-gil?

330
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,638
Oh boy.

331
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:13,391
It's kind of lonely around here.

332
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,019
Dr. Cha and the young doctor
aren't around. Bo-miâ€¦

333
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,648
It's not any different.

334
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,982
Wasn't it like that before?

335
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,318
I like that it's quiet again.

336
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:24,528
That was before.

337
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,030
It used to be busy here but now it's not.

338
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,907
Will he be back?

339
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,325
Of course, he will.

340
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:31,868
-What?
-He has to since his body is here.

341
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,205
What a lucky guy. He gets to go outside.

342
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:41,378
Oh gosh. Waiting is such a chore.

343
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,715
What? The coma patients?

344
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,009
We had a scare with one of the patients.

345
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,428
Keeping them around
will only cause headaches.

346
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,723
So have them transferred
to other hospitals.

347
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:54,724
Well, that'sâ€¦

348
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,852
We had a little emergency,

349
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,937
but the coma patient is stable now.

350
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,108
Dr. Ban, you tend to override my orders.

351
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,026
-What?
-I let the matter

352
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,279
with the boy patient go.
You think I'm a softie?

353
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,281
Shall we discuss that matter now?

354
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:12,534
-What?
-I think I'll also bring that up.

355
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,286
The patient in the bed next to the one
who had an emergency.

356
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:19,082
I recall he was a walnut snack seller.

357
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:22,294
-Wasn't the lead surgeonâ€¦
-We don't have any spare patient beds.

358
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,921
And we did enough for the patients
and even more.

359
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,465
We surely cannot continue like this.

360
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,885
Let's not delay this.

361
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:32,888
I'm sick and tired of coma patients.

362
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:40,228
You'll feel a slight discomfort.

363
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,909
You'll feel a slight discomfort.

364
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,296
Mom, I'm in the middle
of something important.

365
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:07,881
I'll call you back. Sorry.

366
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:13,803
I'll insert the swab.

367
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,264
Some discomfort.

368
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,476
Soo-jung. I'll drop by
to give you some snacks.

369
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,311
Soo-jung?

370
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,521
Did you hang up?

371
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,190
She hung up.

372
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,069
I haven't been here for many years.

373
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,863
Why did she have to choose to work here?

374
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:36,326
Which floor
is the Ophthalmology Department?

375
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,372
Which is better? This one or this?

376
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:47,504
You frequent this shop, Dr. Koh?

377
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,466
I came here with Dr. Cha a few times.

378
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,761
I was here with him a few times.

379
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:58,014
He criticized me
by calling me a fashion terrorist.

380
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,559
Dr. Cha said that?

381
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,477
What?

382
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:06,022
Yes. He said he started dressing well.

383
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,362
That one looks nice.

384
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,206
Donâ€™t you get sick and tired
of wearing the same outfit?

385
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,749
You've been wearing that for years.

386
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,584
People were talking about you
behind your back.

387
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,919
They called you a fashion terrorist.

388
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,046
Dr. Chaâ€¦

389
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:35,010
never hated you even once.

390
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,597
He fondly remembers the good memories.

391
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,018
That's why he can't hate you.

392
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,478
He doesn't feel it.

393
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:48,690
When he was reunited with you,

394
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,359
he was mad

395
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,279
because it took you so long to return.

396
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,531
He had waited for years.

397
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:00,118
That's probably why.

398
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,412
Since you left,

399
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,123
his personalityâ€¦

400
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,917
changed a little.

401
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,628
He became petty.

402
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,343
And right nowâ€¦

403
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,264
he's trying his bestâ€¦

404
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,602
to hang in there.

405
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,358
So that you won't have to wait longâ€¦

406
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,320
until he wakes up.

407
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:38,948
I know this.

408
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,702
Because I'm close to Dr. Cha.

409
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,006
You're done.

410
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,467
He'll be fine
if he takes his prescribed medication.

411
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:01,012
You're a young doctor
but you're very good.

412
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,097
I'm so grateful.

413
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,515
Thank you.

414
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:04,682
I'm just doing my job.

415
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,187
Mom?

416
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,857
Mom, let me explain.

417
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,318
Soo-jung. We need an ABGA test.

418
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,612
-It's an emergency.
-Okay. I'm coming.

419
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,364
Mom, wait a minute.

420
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:35,547
-Soo-jung, why aren't you on it?
-I'm on it.

421
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:43,722
Did you talk to their families?

422
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,099
Oh, gosh.

423
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:48,476
Alright. Tell them
to come to the hospital.

424
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,311
We'll discuss it in person.

425
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,479
Okay.

426
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,191
My life really sucks.

427
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,527
Actuallyâ€¦

428
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,946
I don't make the decisions.
I'm on a fixed salary.

429
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,992
If I cross upper management,
I'll get fired.

430
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,459
Who do we have here?

431
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,961
I look good in this photo.

432
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,549
Back then I was brimming with hope.

433
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:23,219
I had a sense of duty
and listened carefully to my patients.

434
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,018
There you are. The most caring among us.

435
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:33,438
He was a fine doctor.

436
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,315
Everyone looked up to him.

437
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:37,984
It was all for nothing.

438
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,361
He passed so suddenly.

439
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,489
Life can be so in vain.

440
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,791
How could she lie to me?

441
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,543
She said she was in ophthalmology?

442
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,879
What was she doing in ER?

443
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,631
Oh my goodness.

444
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,800
She lied to me.

445
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,720
Did I ever force her to do anything?

446
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,223
I just want what is best for her.

447
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,432
Oh, that brat!

448
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,059
Indeed!

449
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:15,230
No child knows
how their parents feel towards them.

450
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,523
They think they know best.

451
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:20,819
So you need

452
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:25,824
something refreshing when you're upset.

453
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:30,161
Have this. It's okay.

454
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:37,210
Your daughter is a doctor
at this hospital?

455
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,921
Well, yes.

456
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,507
You must be proud.

457
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,594
But she seems to be an ER doctor.

458
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,305
ER is tough work.

459
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,642
It's the toughest job in the hospital.

460
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:54,936
Exactly.

461
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,397
Why did she choose that?

462
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,816
I'm so upset.

463
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,234
Yes, you're upset.

464
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,735
Of course, you are.

465
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,114
No doctor is doing what they do
for respect

466
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,700
or because it's gratifying.

467
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:12,537
ER doctors run around
saving patients all day.

468
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,039
They stay up late working.

469
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:20,169
What reward is there
if they don't have time for their family?

470
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,629
It's so meaningless.

471
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:25,717
The best job is to earn a lot
without a lot of effort.

472
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,220
That's how you repay your parents.
Isn't that so?

473
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,181
Oh my. Lady, you got your priorities
all wrong.

474
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,810
You work at a hospital.
How can you say that?

475
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,897
If a doctor only cares about making money,

476
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,232
that's no doctor.

477
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,027
What kind of utter nonsense
are you spewing?

478
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,466
Are you comfortable?
We can stay in the car.

479
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:49,634
I'm fine.

480
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,262
It's nice here.

481
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:57,141
I thought I'd never see a pretty scene
like this again.

482
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,271
Why are you staying by Dr. Cha's side
when it's so hard?

483
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,816
You don't know if he'll wake up.

484
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,446
Sorry. I shouldn't be saying that.

485
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,662
Because I'm afraid

486
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,708
of losing him again.

487
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:26,671
12 years ago, I left him.

488
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,507
I was so stupid.
I didn't have the courage.

489
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:34,971
I'm not going to lose him again.

490
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,515
That's why I'm trying harder.

491
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,522
But I'm getting fearful.

492
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,443
I vowed to save him.

493
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,780
I'm afraid I might fail.

494
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,826
There's not much I can do.

495
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,079
Youâ€¦

496
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,041
are doing your best.

497
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,963
By being at his side.

498
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,069
She's not answering her phone.

499
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:34,113
Mom is sure mad at me.

500
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,450
Grandpa.

501
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,494
Mom found out.

502
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,165
How do I fix this?

503
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,343
I've seen this scene before.

504
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:03,184
Maybe it wasn't
Seung-tak in his body then, too.

505
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:05,853
Doctor.

506
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,313
I heard you collapsed.

507
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:08,898
Are you okay? Are you feeling better?

508
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,733
I was so alarmed when I heard the news.

509
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,193
See, Doctor?

510
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,529
You look a lot better
after resting for a day.

511
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,075
I'm doing so much for both of you lately.

512
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,954
You hid the Black card.

513
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:23,955
That?

514
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:27,125
I gave it to Dr. Kim.
It's to cover the doctor's room upkeep.

515
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,628
I lent you my body and my car.
You have to ask for my credit card?

516
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,422
You've been freeloading off me a lot.

517
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,801
Anyway, thanks.

518
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,554
What kind of thank you is that?

519
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,390
I almost forgot.

520
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,475
The clothes I boughtâ€¦

521
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,436
584,000 won. Or was it 585,000 won?

522
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,647
Anyway, wire the money to Dr. Jang.

523
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,150
What?

524
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,736
He bought clothes?

525
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,495
I'm not assuming Dr. Cha's persona.

526
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,330
Dr. Cha is inside of me.

527
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:11,419
I know.

528
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,130
It can't be true.

529
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,632
But it would be niceâ€¦

530
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,760
if that were true.

531
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,181
For just a day as if in a dream.

532
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,702
If I studied this hard in med school,
I'd have gotten into Harvard.

533
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,872
What a long way to go.

534
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,711
Seung-tak!

535
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:57,548
You're up already?

536
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:01,802
Did the workers wake you?

537
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:03,804
I know.

538
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:07,558
Why did you hire contractors?
The noise woke me up.

539
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,312
They're fixing the pipes.

540
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,899
We had problems with water pressure.
It's a mess.

541
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:18,236
Something is clogging the pipes.

542
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,196
They said they have to replace the pipes.

543
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,826
Oh my. Father!

544
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,079
Are you okay?

545
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:29,956
Grandpa.

546
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,041
What were you doing there?

547
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,335
Oh no. Oh my goodness. Father.

548
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:37,380
Hey, use your words.
Don't spray me with water.

549
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:42,009
Seung-tak, go fetch a towel, would you?

550
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:45,554
A hoseâ€¦

551
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,014
A barrier?

552
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:48,849
-Oh my.
-Seung-jo!

553
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,360
What? Who is it?

554
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,783
What? Why are you here so early?

555
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,743
It's me, Seung-tak.
Take your time to get ready.

556
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,203
I found something.

557
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,372
-What?
-You found what?

558
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,791
-About the barrier.
-What?

559
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,210
The blocked blood flow!

560
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,212
I'm not following.

561
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,382
Your brainwaves are improving
but there's something blocking you.

562
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,259
The wall, the blood vessel, and Seung-jo.

563
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,928
Because the blood flow increased,
it pinched his internal mammary artery.

564
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,889
Could it be that the blood vessel
to your brain is being pinched?

565
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,142
I was tested though.

566
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,810
Yes, you had a CT scan
of your blood vessels.

567
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,979
Nothing looked abnormal.
But you only had brainwave scans.

568
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,064
Because your brainwaves were not normal.

569
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,566
Now your brainwaves are okay.

570
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,110
-Angiography!
-Angiography!

571
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:44,238
-What are you talking about?
-Let's get him tested first.

572
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,549
-We'll begin now.
-Okay.

573
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:05,968
Shoot.

574
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,349
The subclavian artery
on his left looks fine.

575
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,353
-Shall we check his common carotid artery?
-Yes.

576
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,609
The left common carotid artery
looks fine too.

577
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,616
There is it.

578
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:29,742
There it is.

579
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:33,496
-The innominate artery.
-His innominate artery has narrowed.

580
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,669
We found it. That's it.

581
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,756
How did you discover this?

582
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,635
I was born a genius, you see.

583
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:51,013
A genius can see an apple fall
and immediately tell that's gravity

584
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:53,682
and find the density of a material
while in a bathtub.

585
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,771
What? Why you!

586
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:19,250
Oh my, I'm sorry. I felt so happy.

587
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,502
It's fine. It can happen
when you're happy.

588
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:29,635
I found the cause
of Dr. Cha's weakening consciousness.

589
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:30,761
-What?
-Really?

590
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,388
How did he discover it?

591
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:33,973
How could he?

592
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,439
This is the angiography test we did
this morning.

593
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,192
You can see his innominate artery
has narrowed.

594
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:49,905
It's causing less blood to flow
to his brain. That's affecting him.

595
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,031
I see.

596
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:53,742
Why didn't we detect this before?

597
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:56,036
He had MRI and CT scans.

598
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,873
In his previous CT scans,

599
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,125
it was hard to detect a decrease
in blood flow.

600
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,712
During that time, the flow
was worsening and improving.

601
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,297
That's why it didn't show.

602
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:10,759
Then did his brainwave activity spike
because of blood flow improvement?

603
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:14,763
That is hard to tell in medical terms.

604
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:19,768
What occurred is hard to analyze.
It's outside the realm of medical science.

605
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,485
Why did he have to say that?

606
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:29,778
Seung-tak is impressive.

607
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:31,655
He found the cause.

608
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:35,743
You mean Dr. Cha can wake up from his coma

609
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,119
if you fix the innominate artery?

610
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,496
How will you fix it?

611
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,540
With artery graft surgery.

612
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:45,127
Replace the entire innominate artery
to improve the blood flow.

613
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,296
You could play it safe
and do bypass surgery.

614
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:50,549
Since the patient is young,
you should completely fix it.

615
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,929
Did you schedule the operation?

616
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,681
Yes, it'll be done tomorrow at 8 a.m.

617
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,732
You want me to handle Dr. Cha's operation?

618
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,651
Dr. Koh, why are you doing this to me?

619
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,071
Thank you for letting me
operate on Seung-jo.

620
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:15,032
-What?
-Even though you knew

621
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,784
you'd be in trouble,
you sided with the patient.

622
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,702
We're on the same boat now.

623
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:21,288
A boat? I haven't done anything.

624
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,624
When Dr. Cha wakes up,
he'll join us on that boat.

625
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,918
Can I get off that boat?

626
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,294
I get seasick.

627
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,713
Please?

628
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,635
Fine.

629
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,679
You'll be the assisting surgeon, right?

630
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,099
What? No, I can't.

631
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,809
Don't you remember what Tess said?

632
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,894
How can we proceed with the surgery
in this situation?

633
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:48,107
Despite all that, you operated on Seung-jo
without a problem.

634
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,693
It was risky. Our connection wasn't solid.

635
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:52,695
You said it was momentary, right?

636
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,072
That single moment was very frightening.

637
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:57,449
It happened again to me
at the clothing store.

638
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,118
I'll pay you back, Dr. Jang.

639
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,038
Thank you.

640
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,712
Did I buy too much?

641
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,425
You're not confident?
Alright then, I heard you.

642
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:15,801
Who said I wasn't confident?

643
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:17,303
I'm the best.

644
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:21,015
You were afraid your urge
to save a patient

645
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,267
wasn't as strong as the others.

646
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,395
That's what motivated you to save lives.

647
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:31,650
Is there a doctor who wants to cure you

648
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,110
more than you do?

649
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,785
Are you just going to let
Seung-tak keep winning points?

650
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:45,289
You said you were going to bring him down.

651
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:47,958
But he's soaring even higher.

652
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,543
When will it happen?

653
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:55,382
He used to be such a slacker.
Why is he suddenly so motivated?

654
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,384
They're calling him a genius.

655
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,472
Is he possessed by a spirit?

656
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:05,225
Then you should do an exorcism.

657
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:07,102
That's ridiculous, Mother.

658
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:09,146
Aren't you busy?

659
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:12,650
You'll let them take over the hospital?

660
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:17,237
You're the older cousin
but you can never beat him.

661
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,490
All your life, you just keep losing.

662
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:21,784
Mother!

663
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,118
I'll go.

664
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,578
Oh, gosh.

665
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,747
I thought you'd take after me
and be ambitious.

666
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:28,999
This is so upsetting.

667
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,513
What is it now?

668
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,476
Who is getting an operation?

669
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:51,188
If they do it, Dr. Cha will wake up?

670
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,983
So who will perform the surgery?

671
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,861
The procedure itself
isn't the most challenging kind.

672
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,489
It'll be hard due to the dissection
and the fact it's a reoperation.

673
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:02,408
Even if my hand shakes for a moment,

674
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:04,701
I can control the situation
as I did before.

675
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:08,163
What are the high-risk areas?
The ones we have to watch out for.

676
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,957
When you attach the innominate artery

677
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,251
and stitch the native and graft.

678
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:15,754
If you slice the native,
then you have to go deeper.

679
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,549
Which makes it more complicated and risky.

680
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:21,343
If we don't succeed in stitching itâ€¦

681
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:26,014
It'll be a failure.

682
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:51,790
Dr. Ban will be the lead surgeon.
And Dr. Koh will be his assisting surgeon.

683
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:55,461
So Dr. Cha will operate on himself?

684
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,298
Army navy retractor.

685
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,902
Something was off.

686
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:21,487
Something's happening

687
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,779
between them.

688
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:33,332
I'm good at this, aren't I?

689
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:37,753
In the beginning,
I made mistakes and left cuts.

690
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:40,756
Did it hurt?

691
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,216
Sorry.

692
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,343
It was my first try so I couldnâ€™t help it.

693
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:48,305
Heâ€¦

694
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,017
won't be able to remember.

695
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:56,772
You know why you shave
a coma patient's beard?

696
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,775
You don't know when they'll wake up.

697
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:04,238
It's so they won't be shocked
when they see themselves after recovery.

698
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,448
I won't rememberâ€¦

699
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,785
the things that happened during my coma.

700
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,995
You might get mad at me

701
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,831
when you wake up.

702
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,044
It would hurt less

703
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:21,129
if you get mad with your handsome looks.

704
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,341
It's okay.

705
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:27,553
We can start over.

706
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:30,264
That'll do it.

707
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,770
This is the last time
I'll do this for you.

708
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:40,232
Starting tomorrow, do it yourself.

709
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:42,859
You know

710
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:44,820
what I mean, right?

711
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:55,789
Here's your reward for solving the case.

712
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,250
A reward.

713
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:01,253
It's a soft drink though. I prefer milk.

714
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:02,754
I need more protein.

715
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,548
That's a protein drink.

716
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:06,425
Replenish your protein with that.

717
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:07,676
Really?

718
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:15,017
It's cool and refreshing
like the two of us.

719
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,310
Shut up.

720
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:20,522
I'm drinking one too
cause I didn't have a filling dinner.

721
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:29,740
You don't look that great today.

722
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,534
Haven't you been going home lately?

723
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:33,785
You had night shifts?

724
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,662
I'm avoiding going home.

725
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,957
I'm not ready
to face the impending tirade.

726
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,208
From whom?

727
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,419
Did your mom find out the truth?

728
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:44,046
Let's talk about that later.

729
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:46,089
Focus on Dr. Cha's surgery for now.

730
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,634
Be on your toes tomorrow.

731
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:51,845
I'm not going to be doing it.
So why get pumped up?

732
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:54,014
Don't page me starting tomorrow.

733
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:58,477
This whole thing will be over now.
It feels great.

734
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,272
A lot of people will be happy.

735
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,858
And there'll be disappointed folks.

736
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:09,321
What about you?

737
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,239
How will you feel?

738
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:13,742
Take a guess.

739
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:17,454
By the way,

740
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:20,374
what did you witness 20 years ago?

741
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,000
What was it?

742
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,126
What did you see?

743
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:26,505
I'll tell you later.

744
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:29,716
I have a lot on my mind.

745
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,260
I don't know if I should wish

746
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:34,680
for the boy I saw then to forget it all,

747
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:38,183
Or wish for him to keep pushing
even if it's tough.

748
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,481
I've got a patient coming.

749
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:46,566
Good luck tomorrow. Bye.

750
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:09,548
The patient crashed
while riding an electric scooter.

751
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:11,717
He has a broken rib.
We suspect lung damage.

752
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,678
Looks like we need cardiology.
Seung-tak is available, right?

753
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:15,637
Page him.

754
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,724
Seung-tak has a bigâ€¦

755
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,559
I'll call another doctor.

756
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:28,275
-Have you seen Tess?
-I finally found you. Where were you?

757
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,152
Dr. Chaâ€¦

758
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,529
I'm sorry to ask for another favor.

759
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:34,865
I'm really sorry butâ€¦

760
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,617
Could you make a call
to the walnut snack shop?

761
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,328
-What?
-You're having surgery tomorrow.

762
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:42,497
That's great. Congratulations.

763
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:46,460
I know you're super busy.
But this is urgent to me.

764
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:48,462
Hoon-gil is depressed.

765
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,547
And Bo-mi disappeared after recovering.

766
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,716
You know that if I disappear,

767
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,010
it'll be because I died.

768
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:04,269
WALNUT SNACK RECIPE

769
00:51:06,062 --> 00:51:07,105
I'll go.

770
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:11,943
And I'll try some of the walnut snacks.

771
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:14,738
Where is the address?

772
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:21,745
Anyone in?

773
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:37,636
So he was a walnut snack artisan.

774
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,430
Who are you?

775
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,811
We're not open.

776
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,855
Nobody buys the walnut snacks that I make.

777
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,024
They're not selling
because they don't taste good.

778
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:52,484
What?

779
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:56,321
Just follow this recipe.
You'll find success.

780
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:03,620
And if you have time,
visit the hospital with your son.

781
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:05,747
He's been waiting for you.

782
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:12,128
HODU NARAE

783
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:16,550
WALNUT SNACK RECIPE

784
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,413
When did you get here?

785
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:52,377
I'm just returning them
before you wake up.

786
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:56,131
It's all right.
You don't have to return it.

787
00:52:57,173 --> 00:52:58,174
Thanks.

788
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:02,554
Thank youâ€¦

789
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:05,849
for all you did.

790
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:10,770
Sure.

791
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:14,316
Fix that temper of yours when you wake up.

792
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,741
What? Are you nervous?

793
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,620
That you'll make a mistake operating
on yourself?

794
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,039
Is that it?

795
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:34,252
Then let the living handle it.

796
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,713
Gosh. You won't listen.

797
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:41,885
I can't stop you
from trying to save your own body.

798
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,345
Nobody can.

799
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,350
You said it before.

800
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,268
That it's up to heaven's will

801
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:52,020
whether you wake up or not.

802
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,160
Thanks for the suit.

803
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,203
What are we here for?

804
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,792
It's dusty.
Why didn't they clean my office?

805
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,461
Everything has been untouched.

806
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:06,177
A life full of happy hormones.

807
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:10,265
I'd like to do it for you, but I can't.
So do it yourself.

808
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:17,313
I need to wear these gloves?

809
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:21,109
I don't say this to anyone
so listen carefully.

810
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:23,236
Do this once a week.

811
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:26,364
It's not for moisturizing your hands.

812
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:28,116
Patients' lives depend on your hands,

813
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:30,452
so you need to take care of your hands
like the way you care for patients.

814
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,537
Do I have to?

815
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:35,248
Go to the operating room
at least once a day.

816
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:37,042
Either assisting a surgeon
or as an observer.

817
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:40,754
You visited the hospital
since you were a boy.

818
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:41,796
Do what you did.

819
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:45,008
Frequent the operating room
and you'll get used to it.

820
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:47,927
You can overcome your fear.

821
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,853
I'll be by your side to help.

822
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:58,897
Like you did for me.

823
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:01,191
This is howâ€¦

824
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:03,651
I'll repay you.

825
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:18,291
That's strange. He's bleeding.

826
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,045
Nurse Jung!

827
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:24,172
Yes?

828
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:26,007
-Hello.
-I'll be there.

829
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:30,804
Yes?

830
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:33,640
What?

831
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:38,269
What's the matter? What happened?

832
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:39,729
There's blood dripping
from his chest tube.

833
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:41,564
His heart rate went up
and his blood pressure is falling.

834
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:45,485
The patient crashed while on a scooter.
Dr. Jung examined his X-ray and CT scan.

835
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,570
He said he would
do a rib fixation tomorrow.

836
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:51,699
Even though he has a few broken ribs,
luckily, none of them damaged the aorta.

837
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,743
He said he could perform surgery tomorrow

838
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,703
after drawing blood
and monitoring him tonight.

839
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:58,706
The light color of the blood
indicates the aorta has been torn.

840
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:00,583
A broken rib cut the aorta
while he was breathing.

841
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:03,253
He's dying.
He needs to be operated on now.

842
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:05,964
It's the aorta.
A broken rib cut his aorta.

843
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:07,382
What?

844
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:08,716
What should we do?

845
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:13,847
Don't hesitate. Call a senior doctor.
And call anesthesiology. Schedule surgery.

846
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:16,933
Call a senior doctor.
I'll move him to an operating room.

847
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:22,605
What now? Dr. Jung says
it'll take him two hours.

848
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,941
He can't make it?
Are there any other doctors?

849
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:28,653
Dr. Han had a drink so he can't do it.
Dr. Kim is in another city.

850
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:30,947
I'm going crazy.

851
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:34,659
Did you not hear me?

852
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:36,703
How can we do this surgery?

853
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:38,788
You said he can't wait for two hours.

854
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,790
We're talking about the aorta.

855
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:43,418
It's major surgery and very risky.

856
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:45,128
That's why you have to do it.

857
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:47,464
My hands are not working right.
I told you this.

858
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,174
What if my hand shakes
in the operating unit?

859
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:52,135
Don't you know that one mistake
made during surgery like this

860
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:54,095
could end up killing the patient?

861
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:55,638
What about your surgery?

862
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,974
Aren't you taking a risk yourself?

863
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:59,601
That's my life.

864
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,312
Even if the operation is unsuccessfulâ€¦

865
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:05,857
Anywayâ€¦

866
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,359
this is a different patient.

867
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:10,778
How can you gamble with someone's life?

868
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,072
Keep drawing blood

869
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:16,034
and provide him with blood
to keep him alive.

870
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:17,202
Can a drowning person

871
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,080
wait until rescuers come?

872
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:23,625
-What?
-A patient can't wait

873
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:25,001
for a doctor to arrive.

874
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,294
You said that yourself.

875
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:32,008
Seung-tak!

876
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:53,613
Why isn't anyone coming?

877
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,713
His blood pressure fell to 60.

878
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:13,258
The patient won't last much longer.
Do something.

879
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,718
Seung-tak, can't you do something?

880
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,555
You're the only person
who can save this patient.

881
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:34,362
Did his aorta burst?

882
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:46,040
Scalpel.

883
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,305
Bovie.

884
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:05,727
I think it burst already.

885
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:07,270
It's too late, right?

886
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:15,069
Deaver retractor.

887
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:24,746
Suture. Prolene 4-0.

888
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:26,831
Hey, Seung-tak.

889
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:29,292
Focus now!

890
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:30,627
Suture.

891
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,636
They're what now?

892
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:43,931
They're operating on a critical patient.

893
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,516
The ICU was in chaos.

894
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,686
They mentioned the aorta.
It's supposed to be difficult.

895
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:50,772
They had to do this?

896
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:27,141
Hey, Seung-tak. Do something.

897
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:29,227
Otherwise, the patient will die.

898
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:32,980
Seung-tak!

899
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:34,190
Seung-tak!

900
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,048
What are you doing? Grab the clamp!

901
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:01,801
Give me the clamp. Hurry.

902
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:50,535
Hey, Seung-tak.

903
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:53,162
Why did this have to happen to me?

904
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:57,208
-Dr. Cha, you ruined Seung-tak's life.
-I don't know if he'll come back.

905
01:03:57,917 --> 01:04:00,837
I want this to end.
I just want to live a normal life.

906
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,840
I don't have much time. I'll die.

907
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:07,176
You can die before your body
enters the operating unit.

908
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,387
You have a patient who needs a doctor.

909
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:11,681
The patient dies on the operating table
before surgery even begins.

910
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:14,642
You're telling me to operate on Dr. Cha?

911
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:16,519
I don't think
we'll be seeing each other anymore.

912
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:23,985
