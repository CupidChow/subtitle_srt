1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:04,972
K-foodie meets J-foodie.

2
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:06,306
This is insane.

3
00:00:09,538 --> 00:00:11,048
OSAKA, JAPAN

4
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:13,046
OSAKA, THE NO. 1 GOURMET TRAVEL SPOT

5
00:00:13,484 --> 00:00:16,877
THE JAPANESE COMFORT FOOD
THAT RIVALS JJAJANGMYEON

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,886
JJAJANGMYEON VS YAKISOBA

7
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,587
-Next time…
-Yes.

8
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:22,756
-…we'll go to Sakai in Osaka…
-Okay.

9
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:24,658
…and I'll take you to an okonomiyaki place

10
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:28,428
where the owner turns

11
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:30,464
everything into a masterpiece.

12
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,799
I want to go there.

13
00:00:33,596 --> 00:00:36,904
EPISODE 19
MATJJIGAE'S ALL-TIME FAVORITE YAKISOBA

14
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,205
Where are we?

15
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:39,806
-We're in…
-Yes.

16
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,774
…Sakai.

17
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:44,912
Sakai is located just south of Osaka…

18
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:46,113
30 MINUTES BY CAR

19
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:49,917
…and it's actually pretty rich in culture

20
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:52,686
-and history.
-I see.

21
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,155
-But it's kind of low-key.
-Is it?

22
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:58,792
-I once stayed here…
-Okay.

23
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,829
…when I was filming
a YouTube show at a place in Sakai

24
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,166
that makes knives and Japanese swords.

25
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,436
Since I was already here,

26
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:13,874
I wanted to eat something delicious,
so I kept walking.

27
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:16,043
-Like Goro?
-Just like him.

28
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,445
When I was about to give up,

29
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:22,449
thinking, "Guess there's nothing here,"

30
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:26,486
I arrived in front of this shop
that was packed.

31
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:31,658
I went around looking for other places,

32
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:33,060
-but nothing stood out.
-Okay.

33
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:35,462
So I figured I should
check this place one more time

34
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:37,598
and asked, "Do you have a seat now?"

35
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:41,121
They said, "We'll make one for you,"
so I ended up going in.

36
00:01:41,196 --> 00:01:42,469
It's a rather embarrassing story.

37
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:44,338
-It was meant to be.
-Right.

38
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:47,841
It's an okonomiyaki place.

39
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:50,177
The Kansai region
is famous for flour-based dishes,

40
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:53,680
so there are many good okonomiyaki places,

41
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:56,316
-but this one exceeded my expectations.
-Was it the best?

42
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,354
Everything that came out was delicious.

43
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,624
-Back in Korea…
-Yes.

44
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,759
-Was it jjajangmyeon?
-Right. At Seohojang.

45
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:07,394
That dish ties in…

46
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:12,032
-That makes sense.
-…with this place.

47
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,100
Koreans have jjajangmyeon,

48
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,901
-and the Japanese have yakisoba, right?
-Yes.

49
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:19,906
Yakisoba makes
us Japanese feel nostalgic too.

50
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,543
They serve old-school favorites
like yakisoba, okonomiyaki,

51
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,847
and other griddle dishes.

52
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:28,649
Is that the place?

53
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:31,284
-Nice vibe, right?
-It's great.

54
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,754
-Fukuya.
-Fukuya.

55
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,442
FUKUYA

56
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,993
YAKISOBA, OKONOMIYAKI

57
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,194
-Excuse me.
-Welcome.

58
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,195
Come on in.

59
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,464
-I'm back again.
-Thank you.

60
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,199
-Thank you.
-Of course.

61
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,134
Good to see you.

62
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,802
-Hello. I'm Sung Si-kyung.
-Thank you.

63
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,370
-Welcome.
-Nice to see you again.

64
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,639
-I look forward to eating here.
-I'm a bit embarrassed.

65
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:57,444
Honestly, the last thing I wanted
was to promote this place.

66
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,646
-But I think the secret's getting out.
-Really?

67
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:02,349
We have your autograph on the wall.

68
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,951
It seems like people
are looking up our place online.

69
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,620
-He also mentioned this place…
-Yes.

70
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,121
…a few times on Korean TV.

71
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:11,124
-That there's a legendary place in Osaka.
-I saw that.

72
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,094
A place with the best okonomiyaki ever.

73
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:16,096
-I met Yu Jae-seok.
-Yes.

74
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:18,432
He's Korea's version of Sanma Akashiya.

75
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,300
Yes, I saw the show.

76
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,035
-The actress, Shim Eun-kyung…
-Right.

77
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:23,770
-…who won the Japan Academy Prize…
-Yes.

78
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,505
-…was also with you.
-Exactly.

79
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,507
People thought
you might've meant this place.

80
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,242
I definitely meant this place.

81
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,911
That's too much praise.

82
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:34,481
I really didn't want this place
to become well-known.

83
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,116
This might be the worst episode ever.

84
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:38,318
It is. And we're on Netflix too.

85
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,453
Netflix.

86
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,556
-People might come from around the world.
-Koreans will flock here.

87
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:43,657
I'm truly sorry.

88
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,692
-This is his griddle.
-He does everything.

89
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,529
The owner makes everything himself.

90
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:52,299
He keeps grilling like a griddle magician.

91
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,533
No, don't say that.

92
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,470
He must feel pressured!

93
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,238
You've been praising him for ten minutes.

94
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:01,408
This is his stage.

95
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,947
75 YEARS OF GRIDDLE TRADITION
PASSED DOWN THROUGH THREE GENERATIONS

96
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:12,052
ALL KINDS OF DISHES BORN ON THE GRIDDLE

97
00:04:14,616 --> 00:04:18,959
MAIN DISH
OKONOMIYAKI &amp; YAKISOBA

98
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:26,366
Delicious.

99
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,602
This really is amazing.

100
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,404
This place really is the best.

101
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:34,174
I think it's the best in Japan.

102
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:36,143
Yakisoba. This is insane.

103
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,278
I wish I'd known this place sooner…

104
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:39,446
This really is

105
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:42,816
the best okonomiyaki I've ever had.

106
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,518
This is dangerously good.

107
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,622
What should we order first?

108
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,091
You should tell me what to get.

109
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:55,529
Should we save the okonomiyaki
and yakisoba for later?

110
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,430
Personally,

111
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,132
-there are…
-Yes.

112
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,601
…some griddle dishes I'd eat first.

113
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:02,856
-Right.
-We'll eat those first,

114
00:05:02,931 --> 00:05:04,838
-and finish with okonomiyaki and yakisoba.
-Okay.

115
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,039
-Should I do that?
-Sure.

116
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:08,542
-Okay.
-When you come here, you have to try

117
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:09,543
the tomato dish.

118
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:10,844
What?

119
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:12,512
The tomato dish…

120
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,281
It's the grilled mochi tomato cheese.

121
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,149
-Yes, that's it.
-Right.

122
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:17,584
That and something shrimp.

123
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:18,785
-Mayo shrimp.
-Mayo shrimp.

124
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:21,922
-Okay.
-We should have intestines too, right?

125
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,890
-The stamina dish.
-Stamina stir-fry. Got it.

126
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:27,127
THREE APPETIZERS ORDERED

127
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,917
COOKING BEGINS ON THE COOKING GRIDDLE

128
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,999
WARMING GRIDDLE

129
00:05:33,495 --> 00:05:35,387
WARMING GRIDDLE ON

130
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,304
I wanted to ask you something.

131
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:40,006
In Korea, griddle cooking gives off

132
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,843
a somewhat upscale vibe.

133
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,144
In Japan, there are two types.

134
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:48,081
-Right.
-The fancy kind

135
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:49,482
-is where they grill…
-Yes.

136
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:52,352
-At hotels.
-…steak in front of you.

137
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,387
And then you have
these okonomiyaki places.

138
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,356
In the past,

139
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:59,993
there were always places like this
near elementary schools.

140
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,029
-There were casual eateries.…
-Like tteokbokki stalls.

141
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,766
…where kids could grab a bite
with their allowance.

142
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,035
Dak-kalbi plays a similar part in Korea.

143
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,103
Dak-kalbi?

144
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,505
It's spicy stir-fried chicken
made on a round griddle.

145
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:18,178
There was always a good dak-kalbi place
in front of every school

146
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,412
-back then.
-I see.

147
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,248
It's affordable.

148
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,016
We should try it too sometime.

149
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:27,420
APPETIZER
MAYO SHRIMP

150
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:30,690
Excuse me.

151
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,659
-Here's your mayo shrimp.
-That's cute.

152
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,463
-Enjoy.
-Bon appétit.

153
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:37,864
Try some.

154
00:06:38,727 --> 00:06:41,902
MAYO SHRIMP
6,000 WON, 600 YEN

155
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,670
-Let's eat.
-Bon appétit!

156
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,084
We have to start with this.

157
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:01,755
No surprise there. It's amazing.

158
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,089
How could it not be?

159
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,258
For those watching from Korea,

160
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:07,260
it's just like you'd expect.

161
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:10,030
It tastes exactly as it looks.

162
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,499
By the way,

163
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,534
this might be a little rude to say,

164
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,370
but it's such a simple combination.

165
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,706
-Right.
-And there are a lot of dishes like this.

166
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,041
I tried making it at home,

167
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,176
since it’s not a complicated dish.

168
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:24,978
-But I can't get this flavor.
-You can't?

169
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:26,713
I don't know why.

170
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,649
Maybe the vibe plays a role too.
Having a griddle in front of you,

171
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:33,420
the owner cooking before your eyes,

172
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:36,022
and eating it fresh off the griddle.

173
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,258
When you're sharing food
in a noisy, smoky place

174
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:41,328
full of chatter and laughter,

175
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:44,331
you start wondering,
"Why can't I recreate this at home?"

176
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:48,601
The owner makes everything over there.

177
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:53,373
He's cooking nonstop.

178
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,843
But I have to say,
Japanese mayonnaise really is delicious.

179
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,546
There are so many kinds of mayo in Japan.

180
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,514
Pollock roe mayo is famous in Fukuoka.

181
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:03,483
And there are healthier options

182
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,919
like half-calorie mayo
or ones with richer flavors.

183
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,355
There are so many varieties,
so I always take some home.

184
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,656
I see.

185
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,994
That's the grilled mochi tomato cheese.

Here's your grilled mochi tomato cheese.

GRILLED MOCHI TOMATO CHEESE
8,000 WON, 800 YEN

189
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,714
-It kind of looks like pizza.
-This is…

190
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:37,050
-It almost seems like Italian food.
-It does.

191
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:38,518
Thank you.

192
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:55,201
This is so good.

193
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,470
It's not just ketchup,

194
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,772
and not just tomato.

195
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,840
The two together create

196
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,176
-such a delicious flavor.
-I agree.

197
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,579
These go so well together.

198
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,681
I love it.

199
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:11,284
It's got that Italian vibe,

200
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:14,254
so it adds a nice twist.

201
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,426
This is seriously good.

202
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,061
It's the best.

203
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:25,365
It feels like a Western dish,

204
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,534
but there's mochi, which is very Asian.

205
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,836
This feels like a theme park of flavors.

206
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,805
Every bite is a different ride.

207
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:36,109
Everyone would enjoy this.

208
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,978
This is the kind of dish you crave
no matter how old you are.

209
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:44,084
It feels like I'm at
a casual Western-style restaurant.

210
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,688
Should I drizzle this on top?

211
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,294
-Did you add more mayo?
-Yes.

212
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,638
It's good.

213
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,173
-It is.
-Very tasty.

214
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,610
It would also be great on bread.

215
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:12,479
You could just put this on top.

216
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,217
The scraped-off cheese bits.

217
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,553
That crispy part is irresistible.

218
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,397
-What's this?
-Stamina stir-fry intestines.

219
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,333
This is really good too.

APPETIZER
STAMINA STIR-FRY INTESTINES

222
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,743
Why do Japanese dishes
use the word "stamina?"

223
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,412
Do people believe eating intestines
gives you stamina?

224
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,414
-Why would that be?
-Because of the garlic.

225
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,415
-Oh, the garlic.
-Yes.

226
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,785
Any dish with garlic
get labeled "stamina."

227
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,722
Does that mean it boosts your virility?

228
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,023
I think you mean energy.

229
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,124
Virility is…

230
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,228
Choose your words carefully.

231
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:06,332
Virility doesn't necessarily mean
sexual energy in Korean.

232
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,967
It can also just mean energy.

233
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:09,836
-That's true.
-Yes.

234
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:11,437
These are the intestines.

235
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:15,308
This is insane.

236
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:22,549
This is insane.

237
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:28,354
Are these pork intestines?

238
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:29,522
No, they're beef.

239
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:30,690
-Beef intestines.
-Yes.

240
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:33,226
Which part is this?
It seems like makchang.

241
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:34,827
-It's akasen in Japanese.
-Okay.

242
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:37,163
It's the cow's fourth stomach.

243
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:42,802
I think the part you liked the most

244
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,305
when we had gopchang in Korea

245
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,140
-was this one.
-I remember.

246
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,508
-Really?
-Makchang.

247
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:51,211
-Makchang.
-Yes, it has a nice texture.

248
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,313
And there's not much fat.

249
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:03,890
It feels like we just went from
a Western restaurant to a yakiniku place.

250
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,191
Right?

251
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,493
You can travel the world here.

252
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:09,729
Ichimi chili powder.

253
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,372
-Is it good?
-It's the best.

254
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:23,543
This is so well-seasoned
and the texture is incredible.

255
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,911
It's amazing.

256
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,046
The sweetness of
the veggies is irresistible.

257
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,215
I agree. The sweetness of the vegetables…

258
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:33,586
-And that sound is so nice, too.
-Isn’t it?

259
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:36,856
It lets you know that
someone is making it with care.

260
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,594
Should we have okonomiyaki and yakisoba?

261
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:42,929
Sure. Yakisoba.

262
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:45,665
-Is okonomiyaki with everything the best?
-Right.

263
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:46,633
-With everything.
-Yes.

264
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:49,068
And for yakisoba…

265
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,504
Are there that many kinds?

266
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,706
I'm trying to decide
what toppings to put in it.

267
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,876
A lot of customers order
the one with everything.

268
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,679
-It comes with a fried egg on top.
-Then we'll go with that!

269
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:00,980
-Sounds good.
-Okay.

270
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,182
What's the difference between

271
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:06,219
Hiroshima-style
and Osaka-style okonomiyaki?

272
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,154
Koreans don't really know.

273
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:09,522
Really?

274
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:12,692
-They look pretty similar.
-Well, that's…

275
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,827
If you say, "They’re all the same,"

276
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:17,764
Osaka people get mad,

277
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,632
and Hiroshima people say,
"They’re different!"

278
00:13:21,463 --> 00:13:24,070
OSAKA-STYLE VS HIROSHIMA-STYLE

279
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:28,841
THE NEVER-ENDING DEBATE

280
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:32,345
We use more batter in Osaka.

281
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,347
OSAKA-STYLE

282
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:37,150
EVERYTHING IS MIXED
INTO THE BATTER AND GRILLED

283
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:40,720
In Hiroshima, they stack the cabbage
and steam it on the griddle.

284
00:13:41,016 --> 00:13:42,159
HIROSHIMA-STYLE

285
00:13:42,334 --> 00:13:44,657
GRILLED IN LAYERS, STEAMED FROM WITHIN

00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:52,732

287
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,546
He keeps his gaze on the food.

288
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:08,848
He's cooking with care.

289
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,719
-He's in tune with the food.
-That's impressive.

290
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,254
I just stand here and zone out.

291
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,256
You're like, "I will make this delicious!"

292
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:21,227
Even when it's busy,
you just stand there, focused.

293
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:22,428
That is true.

294
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:25,531
-When you work on several dishes at once…
-Yes.

295
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:28,167
-…they cook at different times.
-Right.

296
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,236
How do you know which one's done?
Just by instinct?

297
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,504
I just know.

298
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:34,407
That's like his stage.

299
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,790
-Here.
-Okay.

300
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,885
-Excuse me.
-It's here.

301
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,520
Okonomiyaki with everything.

302
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,055
Finally!

00:14:49,784 --> 00:14:53,526
OKONOMIYAKI WITH EVERYTHING
6,800 WON, 680 YEN

304
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,294
-There's green laver powder…
-Okay

305
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,063
…and bonito powder.

306
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,131
-Good.
-Add to your taste.

307
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,832
-All right.
-Okay.

308
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:01,701
I'll sprinkle a little.

309
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:03,870
It's bonito powder.

310
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,842
He knows what he's doing.

311
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,879
Isn't that too much?

312
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:14,247
Not at all.

313
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,082
-Is this okay?
-Yes.

314
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,618
You can add as much as you want.

315
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:22,221
-Let me use this for a second.
-Sure.

316
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:25,691
And then you add
mayonnaise to your taste.

317
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,826
Exactly.

318
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:37,470
You're like an okonomiyaki warrior.

319
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:39,906
-There. Let's dig in!
-Okay.

320
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,808
I'm going to go wild…

321
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:44,911
with mayo.

324

325
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,391
-I'll start.
-Enjoy.

326
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,332
It's delicious.

327
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,907
-It's good.
-Isn't it?

328
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,211
It's light.

329
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,480
-It just melts in your mouth.
-Right.

330
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:24,050
You only notice the cabbage by its flavor.

331
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,252
I can taste it, but I can't feel it.

332
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,221
-Very airy, right?
-Yes.

333
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:35,061
You know, okonomiyaki
is usually on the heavier side.

334
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,463
It can be quite dense with batter.

335
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,433
But with this one, the cabbage
just kind of melts away,

336
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,101
so you could eat a lot more.

337
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,469
I can keep going.

338
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:45,204
-I told you.
-Yes.

339
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:47,473
It just keeps going in.

340
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,876
I've never had anything like this.

341
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,878
It changes your idea
of okonomiyaki, doesn't it?

342
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,880
This is beyond fluffy.

343
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,484
He really knows
how to add air to the batter.

344
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:00,553
It puffed up beautifully.

345
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,521
This is amazing.

346
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:05,358
It's got volume, but when you chew it…

347
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,793
It's airy.

348
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,495
Right. Airy.

349
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:12,965
This place is incredible. Really.

350
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:17,036
If you think anyone can make this dish,
you're seriously mistaken.

351
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:18,871
-I agree.
-The way…

352
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:22,074
he adds air is something else.

353
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,743
Adding air is everything, right?

354
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,545
-When you mix it.
-When we mix it?

355
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:28,180
There's no special technique, though.

356
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,583
There isn't?

357
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,286
That was humblebragging.

358
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:36,255
I think this is the best okonomiyaki

359
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:38,124
I've had in Osaka.

360
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,525
No doubt about it.

361
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:42,495
I think it's the best in Japan.

362
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,932
-This place is on another level.
-It really is.

363
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,633
It's in a different league.

364
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,704
I never thought
I'd want to bring my parents

365
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:54,574
to a place with sauce-covered okonomiyaki.

366
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,709
It's usually heavy.

367
00:17:56,776 --> 00:18:01,514
But here, I'd love to come back
with my parents or seniors.

368
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,749
They'd definitely say,

369
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,618
-"This is amazing."
-Right.

370
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,219
They'd definitely love it.

371
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,822
I hope Koreans get to try this too.

372
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:15,428
This might be the first time I've had
such a light, airy okonomiyaki.

373
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,864
If you think this is
what okonomiyaki is supposed to be,

374
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,600
you won't be satisfied anywhere else.

375
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:25,204
And you didn't find this place online.

376
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,706
You just stumbled upon it.

377
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:30,943
Basically, some higher power led me here.

378
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:35,068
I heard cabbage prices in Japan
skyrocketed. It must've been tough.

379
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,583
It must have been tough
when cabbage prices went up.

380
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,385
Yes, it was rough.

381
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,021
But we had to buy it anyway.

382
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:43,623
We can't run the business without it.

383
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:44,624
True.

384
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,427
If napa cabbage prices go up in Korea,

385
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:49,929
-restaurants really struggle.
-I bet.

386
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,665
-Because kimchi is free.
-Right.

387
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,333
-For restaurants in Japan…
-So it's tough.

388
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,702
…the only thing you get for free

389
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,138
is water that they give you
at the beginning.

390
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:01,040
Even otoshi,
a small appetizer, isn't free.

391
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:03,442
Do you have otoshi in Korea?

392
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:04,944
-No.
-Really?

393
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:08,648
-Yes.
-Maybe someone should speak up and say,

394
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:11,584
"Let's stop giving out free kimchi."

395
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,320
If I ever said that,
I'd probably have to retire.

396
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:15,655
You'd be done for.

397
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:21,027
If you're okay with that,
maybe you should say it.

398
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:24,997
Think of the people who make kimchi.

399
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:29,835
We should start a campaign.
"Time to charge for kimchi!"

400
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:33,172
Making kimchi takes so much work.

401
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:37,043
So most restaurants have given up
making it themselves

402
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:40,246
-and just import it, which is sad.
-That's…

403
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:42,815
-just bad for everyone.
-I agree.

404
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:46,686
People would want real Korean kimchi,
even if they had to pay.

405
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,888
It might be better to charge customers

406
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,691
for properly-made Korean kimchi.

407
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:57,930
Here's your yakisoba.

408
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:00,733
This sound.

409
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:05,004
YAKISOBA WITH EVERYTHING
7,300 WON, 730 YEN

410
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:09,162
MAIN DISH
YAKISOBA

411
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:21,520
Jjajangmyeon led us to this.

412
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,556
-This is what we came for.
-Right.

413
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:27,059
-I don't know if it's okay to say this…
-Yes?

414
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:31,263
But it’s like eating
the most basic yakisoba

415
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,099
without any vegetables.

416
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,668
Yakisoba has a nostalgic taste,
and jjajangmyeon is the same.

417
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,944
-This is the real deal.
-Do we eat it as is?

418
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,514
You can sprinkle
green laver powder if you want.

419
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,458
How is it?

420
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,360
Delicious.

421
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:03,863
They're all sauce-based dishes

422
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,865
but they all taste different.

423
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:09,401
In some places, you can't even tell
what you ate.

424
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:10,936
Their dishes taste the same.

425
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:19,612
What do you think?

426
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:24,150
I could eat three servings of this
all by myself.

427
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,184
Right?

428
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:28,187
Everyone who comes here

429
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:31,223
gulps down the food
as if they're going to order

430
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,691
the entire menu.

431
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,226
This is the best.

432
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:38,764
It tastes kind of like jjajangmyeon too.

433
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:40,132
-Doesn't it?
-Yes.

434
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:46,105
Even Japanese people who've eaten
yakisoba and okonomiyaki to death

435
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:47,606
-would be blown away.
-Totally.

436
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:49,108
-Right?
-I was really shocked.

437
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:50,042
It's so good.

438
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,345
This is so delicious.

439
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,116
Thank you.

440
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:59,185
Deep down,

441
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,687
I wanted to keep this place to myself.

442
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:03,022
I'm sorry.

443
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,324
There's no going back now.

444
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:07,293
I really didn't want to tell anyone.

445
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:24,310
This is dangerous.

446
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,515
I just can't stop eating.

447
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:30,783
What should I do?

448
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,251
You should come here again.

449
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:35,521
You'll have to come back soon.

450
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:37,022
I should stop eating.

451
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,627
I genuinely want to come here again.

452
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,028
Nice.

453
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:44,830
What time do you open?

454
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:46,365
We open at 11:30 a.m.

455
00:22:47,628 --> 00:22:49,168
When do we leave,
the day after tomorrow?

456
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:50,803
NEXT INSANELY GOOD SPOT

457
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,744
Love is in the air.

458
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:54,222
HANGANG RIVER RAMYEON VS KYOTO MONT BLANC
DATE SPOT BATTLE

459
00:22:54,322 --> 00:22:55,741
Because of instant ramyeon,

460
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:59,211
you need to stop by
a Hangang River convenience store

461
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:00,512
this time of the year.

462
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:05,217
It's really delicious and kind of fun.

463
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:08,454
It almost felt like a date.

464
00:23:23,204 --> 00:23:25,204
