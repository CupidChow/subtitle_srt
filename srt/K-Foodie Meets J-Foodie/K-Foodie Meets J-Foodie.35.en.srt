1
00:00:01,535 --> 00:00:04,771
K-foodie meets J-foodie.

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,039
This is insane.

00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:09,476
TODAY'S FOODIE DESTINATION
BUSAN

4
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:11,111
All right!

5
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:13,046
-We're in Saha-gu, Busan.
-Saha-gu.

6
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:15,082
First time for both of us.

7
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:16,483
-We're on a business trip.
-Right.

8
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,353
You've had jjajangmyeon before.

9
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:21,455
Jjajangmyeon… The one we had in Seoul?

10
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:24,091
Exactly. You had it at Seohojang.
That one's the regular version.

11
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:28,028
But when people come to Busan,
they all eat ganjjajang.

12
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:29,730
What's ganjjajang?

13
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:33,066
Regular jjajangmyeon uses sauce
that's made ahead of time.

14
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:36,203
You just pour the pre-made sauce
over the noodles.

15
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:39,406
JJAJANGMYEON: PRE-MADE BLACK BEAN SAUCE
OVER COOKED NOODLES

16
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:40,874
RUNNY SAUCE & EVEN FLAVOR

17
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:44,611
But for ganjjajang, they cook
the veggies fresh to order.

18
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:50,350
GANJJAJANG: STIR-FRIED TO ORDER
WHILE THE NOODLES COOK

19
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:51,885
THICKER SAUCE & SMOKY FLAVOR

20
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:53,120
Sounds like a lot more work.

21
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:54,588
That's right.

22
00:00:54,655 --> 00:01:00,060
And in Busan, they top it off
with a fried egg.

23
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,596
Wait.

24
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:05,032
The sign's in Chinese characters.
"Yeongseongbang."

25
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,134
-"Yeongseongbang."
-"Yeongseongbang."

26
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,937
-A Chinese restaurant.
-Yes.

27
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:14,441
Looks like a legit place.
Even the entrance looks fancy.

28
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:20,113
BUSAN FOODIE DESTINATION
CHINESE RESTAURANT YEONGSEONGBANG

29
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,149
In Korea,
places run by Chinese immigrants

30
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,650
usually say so on the sign.

31
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,052
-I see.
-"Chinese business owner"…

32
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:26,587
-Okay.
-…or "overseas Chinese."

33
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,155
Excuse us.

34
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,524
-Hello.
-Come on in.

35
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,692
Irasshaimase!

36
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,093
-"Irasshaimase."
-Nice to meet you.

37
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,595
-Welcome.
-Hello.

38
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:37,230
-Good to see you.
-Pleasure to be here.

39
00:01:41,543 --> 00:01:44,771
EPISODE 34
BUSAN'S GANJJAJANG AND ULMYEON

40
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:50,243
"Authentic Chinese Cuisine."

41
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:52,813
"Yeongseongbang."

42
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,217
-The menu isn't easy for Japanese people.
-You're right.

43
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:59,219
Just from the Chinese characters
on the cover,

44
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:03,190
I thought even Japanese people
would be able to read the menu.

45
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,692
-But man, this is tough.
-And

46
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,427
it's written vertically.

47
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,664
I can't read a thing.

48
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:13,634
This is exactly how it feels
for Koreans in Japan.

49
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,436
-"Man, this isn't easy."
-Right.

50
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,138
You can't read anything.

51
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:19,539
I really can't.

52
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,642
-That's why I started learning Japanese.
-Really?

53
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:22,843
I wanted to read the menu.

54
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:28,482
Is ganjjajang the most popular
noodle dish here?

55
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:32,686
Yes, Busan is kind of famous for it.

56
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:34,521
All right, then. Ganjjajang it is!

57
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:38,225
And I recommend ulmyeon
since you can't find it in Japan.

58
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,060
What do you think?

59
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,962
What's ulmyeon?

60
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:45,132
You know Cantonmen, right?

61
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:49,036
In Japanese, we call it umami soba.

62
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:52,673
There's something like palbochae

63
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,708
on top of the noodles.

64
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,777
-It's a thick, savory soy-based sauce.
-Okay.

65
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,979
That's Cantonmen.

66
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,015
CANTONMEN (CANTONESE NOODLES)
A JAPANESE-CHINESE NOODLE DISH

67
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:03,316
ORIGINATED IN CANTON, CHINA

68
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:07,354
So ulmyeon is kind of like
the Korean version of that,

69
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:08,722
except it's white.

70
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,023
It's white?

71
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,458
Yes, it's in soup form.

72
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:12,793
Soup?

73
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,194
Okay. Let's get that, too.

74
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,430
One ulmyeon…

75
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,799
And maybe something on the side?

76
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:23,270
Their fried eggplant is really good.

77
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:28,175
Fried eggplant isn't common
in Chinese restaurants in Japan.

78
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:31,745
I think it started at restaurants

79
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:34,081
that had come here from China,

80
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,750
but now you can find it
just about anywhere.

81
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:39,152
Eggplant goes very well with oil, right?

82
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,521
I'm craving something rich

83
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,158
and savory like that.

84
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,395
But here, they add
a little filling inside.

85
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,164
-Meat filling?
-Yes.

86
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,333
-Like hasamiage, then!
-Or kind of like a menchikatsu.

87
00:03:53,808 --> 00:03:55,769
HASAMIAGE(MEANING STUFFED AND FRIED)

88
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:58,638
FILLING SANDWICHED BETWEEN
SLICES OF YOUR CHOICE, THEN DEEP FRIED

89
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,575
That must be what we call
eggplant hasamiage.

90
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,376
Yes, that's it.

91
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,011
Do they have dumplings?

92
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,279
They make them by hand here.

93
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:09,349
I always prefer handmade dumplings.

94
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,784
I agree.

95
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,953
-Alright. Let's order, then.
-Good.

96
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,187
Excuse me.

97
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:15,889
Come on in.

98
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,292
-Hello.
-The owner came.

99
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,095
You're looking stylish! The necklace…

100
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:25,265
Sir, what's that shiny gold thing?

101
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,334
-Is it gold?
-Yes.

102
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,169
-Is it real gold?
-It's 18K.

103
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:30,403
He said it's 18K gold.

104
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,272
I bought it 35 years ago.

105
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,473
Thank you.

106
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,143
I hope some of your good fortune
rubs off on me today.

107
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,611
He wants some of your good energy.

108
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:40,046
-We're really looking forward to this.
-Right.

109
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:43,750
-Are you from Taiwan?
-Yes, I am.

110
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:46,653
-From the southeast.
-Oh, southeast Taiwan.

111
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:51,491
What's been your signature dish
since you opened?

112
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:54,261
Which dish has been your signature
from the start?

113
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,830
-My jjajangmyeon's been famous.
-The jjajangmyeon's been famous.

114
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:59,399
We've got to try the ganjjajang.

115
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,902
I still knead the dough by hand,

116
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,471
and I spent two full years

117
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:06,740
perfecting the jjajangmyeon.

118
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,742
-We'll get ulmyeon or ganjjajang.
-Ulmyeon?

119
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,644
-We should.
-Okay.

120
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,346
We'll have a small fried eggplant,
pan-fried dumplings,

121
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,248
one ganjjajang, and one seafood ulmyeon.

122
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,050
FRIED EGGPLANT, DUMPLINGS,
GANJJAJANG, ULMYEON

123
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,252
-Thank you so much.
-Arigatou!

124
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,087
Thank you.

125
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:26,193
Busan's famous for its Chinatown.

126
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:30,030
-Where is it?
-Right in front of Busan Station.

127
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,064
-The station?
-Yes.

128
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:35,502
SHANGHAI STREET
CHINATOWN JUST IN FRONT OF BUSAN STATION

129
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,737
CHINATOWN

130
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,943
Incheon has a famous Chinatown,

131
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,444
and Busan does too.

132
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,179
They're the two major Chinatowns in Korea.

133
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:49,783
I guess every country
has its own Chinatown.

134
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,284
-There's one in Yokohama.
-Yokohama.

135
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,787
And Kobe and Nagasaki.

136
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:57,157
I actually went to Nagasaki's Chinatown
on a family trip.

137
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:58,558
And…

138
00:05:58,625 --> 00:05:59,826
-Was the food good?
-Yes.

139
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:02,462
Nagasaki's got its own unique twist.

140
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,498
It's not your usual Chinese food.
They've developed their own style.

141
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,267
-Right.
-It's different there.

142
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:12,305
Chinese cuisine always evolves
in unique ways

143
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,075
-wherever Chinese immigrants settle.
-Exactly.

144
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:16,142
It becomes localized.

145
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,646
Same with Cantonmen, you know?

146
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,282
I don't get it at all.

147
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,351
We don't have it in Korea.

148
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,386
-It only exists in Japan.
-I see.

149
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,024
Drinking snacks are here.

150
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,563
People usually
pour vinegar all over this, right?

151
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,731
Yes, pour some right here.

152
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:38,899
-But this…
-Eat it as is?

153
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,067
It's seasoned.
I put some garlic sauce on top.

154
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,869
He said people drizzle vinegar over this.

155
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:46,907
Okay. Pickled radish served
at Chinese restaurants…

156
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,475
-Interesting, right?
-It's very Korean.

157
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,043
What's this?

158
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,279
That's candied sweet potatoes.

159
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,481
Kind of like a complimentary dessert.

160
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:57,050
Is it like "university sweet potatoes"?

161
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:59,419
It's sweet potatoes

162
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:01,421
-coated in syrup.
-This is the same thing.

163
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:04,324
-We call it "university sweet potatoes."
-University sweet potatoes.

164
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:05,592
-Right.
-We do in Japan.

165
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,027
-I don't know why.
-I don't, either.

166
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,029
I was confused the first time I heard it.

167
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,830
"What does that mean?"

168
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,833
DAIGAKU IMO (UNIVERSITY SWEET POTATO)
A CHEAP, POPULAR SNACK

169
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,936
SOLD AROUND JAPANESE UNIVERSITIES
IN THE 1910S-1920S

170
00:07:16,535 --> 00:07:20,440
I'm debating whether to eat
the candied sweet potatoes now.

171
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:21,608
I'm thinking the same thing.

172
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:22,976
I shouldn't, right?

173
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,378
This is supposed to be dessert.

174
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,015
By the way,

175
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:32,886
there's this Japanese female comedy duo

176
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,221
called Harisenbon.

177
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,223
They're huge fans of Mr. Matjigae.

178
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,526
They even do pilgrimage-style
videos on YouTube,

179
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:45,165
visiting the restaurants
featured on Solitary Gourmet.

180
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:49,235
I got invited for a shoot not long ago.

181
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,203
It was fun.

182
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:51,771
I've been on it once, too.

183
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,773
Right? I saw that episode.

184
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,709
They're also huge fans of this show.

185
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:57,677
I'm so grateful.

186
00:07:57,744 --> 00:08:00,480
I even told them that
if they ever come to Korea,

187
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:04,317
I'll take care of the restaurant info

188
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:06,419
and filming permissions for them.

189
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,488
Then they'll come for sure.

190
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,423
-You think?
-I'm positive.

191
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,891
I hope more people come.

192
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:15,862
It would be nice if Japanese shows
featured Korean restaurants, too.

193
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,933
And if viewers watching this show

194
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:23,436
want Si-kyung to guide you
to certain restaurants…

195
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,939
If you have that kind of request…
I can't do it myself.

196
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,240
I can be a great guide.

197
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,709
-A guide.
-Yes.

198
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:32,245
Maybe I should make a song
called "The Guide."

199
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:33,246
"The Guide"?

200
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:34,347
"The Guide."

201
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,416
The Guide

202
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,085
That sounds kind of nice.

203
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,322
I'll introduce your restaurant

204
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:44,891
And be a guide

205
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,361
That sounds pretty good.

206
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:53,967
I'll give you some sweet tips

207
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,069
Just for you

208
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:58,038
-The Guide
-The Guide

209
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,342
-Sounds good.
-Not really.

210
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,444
Looks like you'll have
to introduce the song

211
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,513
at Pacifico Yokohama in October.

212
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,882
Sung Si-kyung singing "The Guide"!

213
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,919
"THE GUIDE"
SUNG SI-KYUNG

214
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,023
The Guide

215
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,325
I'll give you some sweet tips

216
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,261
Just for you

217
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:26,699
-Gosh. It's the worst.
-It is.

218
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,070
-So…
-It's here.

219
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:37,177
Perfect timing.

220
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,814
-Handmade dumplings.
-Amazing.

221
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,283
-Pan-fried dumplings.
-Pan-fried dumplings.

222
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,552
We call them pan-fried,
but they're actually deep-fried.

223
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,421
PAN-FRIED DUMPLINGS
8,500 WON, 850 YEN

224
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,625
Fried eggplant.

225
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,160
This one's good.

226
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:56,596
FRIED EGGPLANT (SMALL)
14,000 WON, 1,400 YEN

227
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,565
-Should we dig in?
-Go ahead.

228
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,502
This looks hot.

229
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:05,538
Let me check.
You can't handle hot food?

230
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,574
I can.

231
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,709
I just want to be careful
not to burn myself.

232
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:11,644
All good.

233
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,480
Tasty?

234
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:14,747
Tasty.

235
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:15,782
-It's good?
-It is.

236
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:16,816
Okay.

237
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:20,520
The owner recommends
trying it with this sauce.

238
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:21,754
All right.

239
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,723
GARLIC SAUCE

240
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:29,028
This sauce has a ton of garlic in it.

241
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,297
-It's like 90% garlic.
-No kidding.

242
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,867
-I'll dig in.
-Go ahead.

243
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,346
Delicious.

244
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,618
Fried eggplant.

245
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,096
I like this one.

246
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,731
It's good.

247
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:06,199
Glad you like it.

248
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,908
This is a good start.

249
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,444
Let's see how the handmade dumplings are.

250
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,725
It has a simple taste.

251
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,968
Maybe the wrapper's unique.

252
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,870
Well, it's handmade.

253
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:45,605
I mean…

254
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:49,108
It doesn't feel like you're eating
meat wrapped in thin dough.

255
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,311
It's more like bread.

256
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,245
-Bread?
-Yes.

257
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,113
Like meat-flavored bread.

258
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:58,084
It's like eating fried bread
with a meaty filling.

259
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:59,819
The crust is crispy, too.

260
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,454
It really feels like meat bread.

261
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,792
What an interesting texture.

262
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:10,396
And pan-fried dumplings
come in all sorts of varieties in Busan.

263
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:13,933
It just depends on your taste.

264
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,236
I'm not saying
this place is the absolute best.

265
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:19,038
Yes.

266
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:21,040
Come on in.

267
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,413
-Who ordered the ganjjajang?
-I did.

268
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,651
So this is ganjjajang.

269
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,253
It smells amazing.

270
00:12:34,161 --> 00:12:37,323
GANJJAJANG
9,000 WON, 900 YEN

271
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,395
Thank you.

272
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,530
-And this is ulmyeon?
-Yes.

273
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,035
ULMYEON
11,500 WON, 1,150 YEN

274
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,270
Looks delicious, right?

275
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,006
-That one looks good too.
-The noodles are handmade too.

276
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:56,542
Show me how to eat ganjjajang.

277
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,144
Pour the sauce over the noodles,

278
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:00,580
and mix it as you say, "Please be tasty."

279
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:05,151
So they make the sauce after you order it?

280
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:08,955
Exactly. If it's made ahead,
the moisture seeps out and ruins it.

281
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:13,993
The way people mix it varies, too.

282
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,029
They mix it like this in movies.

283
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:19,766
-Everyone has their own method.
-Exactly.

284
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:24,570
Also, since it's ganjjajang,
it's less watery.

285
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,407
So the flavor hits harder.

286
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,010
Take some onto your plate.

287
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:35,715
A fried egg on top is a must
for the Busan style, right?

288
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:36,649
Absolutely.

289
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:40,787
Ganjjajang.

290
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,146
So good.

291
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,649
It's a simple flavor

292
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,285
anyone can enjoy.

293
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,555
But you won't find it in Japan.

294
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,594
This is amazing.

295
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:22,995
I'm glad to hear it.

296
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:27,333
The noodles are cooked perfectly.

297
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,642
All these veggies…

298
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,711
I don't even recognize some of them,

299
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:39,679
but they taste great.

300
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,447
It's onion and cabbage.

301
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,483
That's all?

302
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,485
And a little bit of minced meat.

303
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,520
That's pretty simple.

304
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,556
That's why it feels more like yakisoba

305
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,426
than a regular, saucy jjajangmyeon.

306
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,628
GANJJAJANG, YAKISOBA

307
00:14:55,695 --> 00:15:00,032
And when it gets a little heavy,
this refreshes the palate.

308
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:03,002
-Pickled radish?
-This completes the Korean jjajangmyeon.

309
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,570
Jjajangmyeon and pickled radish.

310
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,572
PERFECT KOREAN-CHINESE COMBO

311
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,441
Ganjjajang.

312
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:10,209
Busan's all about ganjjajang.

313
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,378
Jjamppong, spicy seafood noodles,
is great too.

314
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:13,980
Busan is a coastal city after all.

315
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,503
-This is ulmyeon.
-Ulmyeon.

316
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,471
Ulmyeon.

317
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,249
It's packed with ingredients.

318
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:55,054
The noodles are almost the same
as the ones in jjajangmyeon.

319
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,690
-They are the same noodles.
-I see.

320
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,795
-The noodles really soak up the sauce…
-Pull them up all the way.

321
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:20,947
I like this.

322
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,683
You get it, right? I really love it.

323
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,985
Yes, it's delicious. Soft and comforting.

324
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:31,424
This is basically Korean jjamppong
without the chili powder,

325
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,926
thickened with starch
for a slightly gooey texture.

326
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:36,696
They really know
how to handle the noodles here.

327
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,130
Seriously.

328
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:45,304
Sometimes I crave ulmyeon for no reason.

329
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,541
In winter, I want it like crazy.

330
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,309
It would warm you up.

331
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:01,721
It's been a while since I had this.

332
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,924
Long time no ulmyeon.

333
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:06,893
Bamboo shoots.

334
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,632
Shiitake mushrooms.

335
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:23,609
The clams are huge.

336
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,713
This is why people say
seafood noodles taste better

337
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,082
near the coast.

338
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:34,387
The seafood is more fresh.

339
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:37,623
Do they have ulmyeon in Seoul?

340
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,091
-You can find it anywhere.
-Got it.

341
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:42,361
But young Koreans
don't usually order ulmyeon.

342
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:45,765
-Why not?
-Feels like something dads eat.

343
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,266
Is it old-school?

344
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:51,470
Now, spicy dishes like jjamppong
or malatang are more popular,

345
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:56,309
so dishes like chicken noodle soup,
udon, or ulmyeon aren't trendy.

346
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,078
But that's what makes them charming.

347
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:01,514
Personally, I prefer ganjjajang.

348
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,382
Really? Good choice.

349
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,386
You can't get

350
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,323
ganjjajang in Japan.

351
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:12,458
It's a shame, really.

352
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,327
I'm like a dad.

353
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,429
Giving my kid what he likes
and taking the leftovers…

354
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,332
Well, I can eat these dishes anytime.

355
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,553
-It's really delicious.
-Glad to hear that.

356
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,896
Just…

357
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,201
You could've just asked me.

358
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,337
-"Hand me some napkins."
-I mean…

359
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:34,306
You feel so cold in moments like this!

360
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,310
Now that we've gotten close,
you could've just asked.

361
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:39,512
I'd have passed it to you.

362
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:40,613
Just say, "Si-kyung."

363
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,517
I don't do that.

364
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,521
You were being considerate
since I was eating.

365
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,523
Got it.

366
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,159
You're taking it back?

367
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:54,894
This is my revenge.

368
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:56,462
NEXT INSANELY GOOD SPOT

369
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,799
I'm a little worried about
whether it's okay to reveal

370
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,935
your secret spots like this.

371
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,336
It's not okay at all.

372
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,707
My secret spots
are slowly becoming famous.
