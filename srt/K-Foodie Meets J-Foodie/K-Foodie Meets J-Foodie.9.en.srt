We're at Yaksu Station.

13
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:32,966
-You see, Yaksu Station?
-Yes.

14
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,602
-And this is Yaksu Market.
-Okay, a market.

15
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:37,504
Coincidentally,

16
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:41,108
-my closest friend lives nearby.
-I see.

17
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,176
-So I come here often.
-Right.

18
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,112
The market isn’t that big,

19
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:48,248
but it’s packed with great food spots.

20
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:50,951

00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:01,395
-…that you like walnut balls.
-Yes, I love walnut balls.

26
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,096
FROM EPISODE 2

27
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:04,064
Walnut balls.

28
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:05,866
I love walnut balls.

29
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:07,901
There's a great spot near Yaksu Station.

30
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:08,980
Where?

31
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:12,005
There's a spot in Yaksu Market.
They're pretty good.

32
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,006
-Walnut balls?
-Yes.

33
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,508
But walnut balls

34
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,811
isn't really the kind of food
you go to a specific place for, right?

35
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,079
That’s true.

36
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:21,481
It was first made in Cheonan.

37
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,884
-That’s where it all started.
-I see.

38
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:26,453
But you can find them anywhere

39
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:28,956
-in Korea.
-Okay.

40
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:30,223
Shall we go in?

41
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,525
What’s this place?

42
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:32,859
"Nutcracker Walnut Balls."

43
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:34,628
This is the place?

44
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:36,997
He's being a total tourist.

45
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:37,931
WALNUT BALLS

46
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,934
Let's go inside.

47
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:42,603
Hello.

48
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,305
-Hello.
-Welcome.

49
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:47,140
Hello.

50
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:49,030
-Come on in.
-Hello.

51
00:01:49,405 --> 00:01:50,844
There they are!

52
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,145
They’re making them.

53
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:56,850
They are all handmade too.

54
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:58,085
Right.

55
00:01:58,847 --> 00:01:59,840
WALNUT BALLS

56
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,856
A WALNUT-SHAPED DESSERT
WITH RED BEAN AND WALNUT FILLING

57
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,993
STEP 1
PLACE WALNUTS IN THE MOLD

58
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:09,062
STEP 2
ADD BATTER AND RED BEAN PASTE

59
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:14,001
STEP 3
BAKE UNTIL GOLDEN BROWN

60
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:19,006
They just made a fresh batch.

61
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:21,742
-Would you like to try some?
-Yes, please!

62
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:22,809
-What?
-Try some.

63
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,811
-Freshly baked walnut balls?
-Yes.

64
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,380
These are complimentary.

65
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:27,381
-It's hot.
-Thank you.

66
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:28,815
-Be careful.
-Take your time.

67
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,785
He really loves them.

68
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:34,755
This is…

69
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:36,923
It smells amazing.

70
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,164
It's warm.

71
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:45,399
He said it's warm.

72
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,100
It's delicious.

73
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:56,677
This is really good.

74
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:58,912
It tastes amazing.

75
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:00,147
-Really?
-Yeah.

76
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:06,386
The balance of red bean
and walnut is perfect.

77
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:10,490
It’s my first time eating one
straight out of the mold.

78
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,325
-So…
-Yes.

79
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:16,329
-This is how it tastes when it’s warm.
-Right.

80
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:19,366
-They’re not as sweet once they cool down.
-Right.

81
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,268
-That’s why it’s dangerous.
-Dangerous?

82
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,270
-You keep eating without thinking.
-I agree.

83
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,988
-When they're cold.
-Right.

84
00:03:25,363 --> 00:03:27,340
One box is 7,000 won, about 700 yen.

85
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:28,508
That's a steal!

86
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:32,379
I wish they sold these in Japan too.

87
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,848
Let's have this with tea later.

88
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:36,049
-The perfect match.
-Right.

89
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,085
Can I take a photo?

90
00:03:38,255 --> 00:03:39,586
-Can he take a photo?
-Of course.

91
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,461
Should we get a box…
He's already gone to take photos.

92
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,796
A regular tourist right there.

93
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,771
FRESHLY BAKED WALNUT BALLS,
THE SKILL OF A MASTER!

94
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:59,940
FIRST TIME TASTING
FRESHLY MADE WALNUT BALLS

95
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,709
They stay good for three days
at room temperature,

96
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,745
and up to a week if refrigerated.

97
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,080
-They're good for three days at room temp.
-Three days?

98
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:09,583
-If refrigerated, they last up to a week.
-Alright.

99
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:10,650
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

100
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:11,985
-Thank you.
-Please come again.

101
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,083
-Yes.
-Thank you.

102
00:04:13,483 --> 00:04:14,688
How was it?

103
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,223
-It was amazing.
-Glad to hear it.

104
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:21,361
Right over there is my go-to spot

105
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,330
for glutinous rice donuts.

106
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,098
-Oh, donuts?
-Yes.

107
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,768
It’s really close.

108
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:28,969
Pungmi Bunsik.

109
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,238
ANOTHER MUST-VISIT SPOT,
JUST A MINUTE AWAY ON FOOT

110
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,707
-Hello!
-Hello.

111
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:37,310
-I come here often.
-I see.

112
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:41,381
CHAPSSAL DONUT
DEEP-FRIED GLUTINOUS RICE FLOUR DOUGH

113
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:45,752
They grind whole glutinous rice
and use that flour to make the dough.

114
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:49,022
ONCE THE ROUND DOUGH IS FRIED

115
00:04:49,818 --> 00:04:52,659
IT PUFFS UP AND BECOMES A CHAPSSAL DONUT

116
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:55,729
-There are quite a few flavors.
-Okay.

117
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,430
There's mugwort,

118
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,266
sweet potato,

119
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,034
and regular red bean filling.

120
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:02,469
And no filling in this one.

121
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:04,004
-So it’s just plain?
-Yeah.

122
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:06,206
-That one’s really good.
-The plain one?

123
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,308
-Let's try that one.
-One plain for each of us.

124
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,242
-Sure.
-Good.

125
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,877
-I’ll serve it for you here.
-Great.

126
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,246
-Bon appétit!
-Enjoy!

127
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,349
It’s pretty light.

128
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:19,219
-It's so cute.
-It’s airy inside

129
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,230
The texture is interesting.

130
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:33,500
-What’s the dough made of?
-Glutinous rice.

131
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,802
The glutinous rice dough you talked about!

132
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,339
-It's tasty.
-Do you rest the dough?

133
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,181
-It's so good.
-We soak glutinous rice for hours,

134
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:49,182
then grind it.

135
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,483
It's incredible!

136
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,221
-The plain one is really good.
-I'm so glad.

137
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,189
-Isn't it good?
-It is.

138
00:05:56,423 --> 00:06:00,594
That deep-fried
glutinous rice dough texture…

139
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,230
Why don’t we have this in Japan?

140
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,998
I know. I bet the Japanese would love it.

141
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:07,000
They’d go crazy for it.

142
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,202
I want our Japanese staff to try it.

143
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,907
Freshly made ones
must taste better, right?

144
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,976
-These are good even when they cool.
-Really?

145
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,644
Could we get two of each?

146
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:19,379
They're 600 won each, about 60 yen.

147
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:20,647
That's a good deal.

148
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,815
What does it say?

149
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,617
-Five plain ones for 2,000 won, 200 yen?
-Yes.

150
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,454
That’s so easy on the wallet.

151
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:27,587
-That's 9,000 won total.
-Okay.

152
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:28,989
All that for 900 yen.

153
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,690
Just 900 yen? That's incredible.

154
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,492
3 PLAIN SETS (15 PCS): 6,000 WON (600 YEN)

155
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,195

157
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,298
-Can I take a picture?
-Would you like one?

158
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:40,233
-Can he take a picture?
-Of course.

159
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,885
-She said "Sure."
-Thank you.

160
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:44,704
ONLY 50 YEN EACH!
PLAIN CHAPSSAL DONUT… ABSOLUTE BEST

161
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,439
FIRST CHAPSSAL DONUT
NEVER SAW ONE IN JAPAN

162
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,838
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

163
00:06:48,938 --> 00:06:51,444
-It was delicious.
-Thank you. Oh!

164
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,880
-Oh!
-Wow. "It was delicious"?

165
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:55,048
-It was.
-That's past tense.

166
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:56,416
-Yes, past tense.
-Impressive.

167
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:57,484
PAST TENSE, CHECK.

168
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:00,487
It's hard to believe

169
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:04,024
a great walnut ball spot is this close
to an amazing chapssal donut shop.

170
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,492
-Are you having fun?
-Definitely.

171
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,060
Off to another spot now.

172
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:08,461
There’s a fishmonger over there.

173
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,097
-I love hairtail fish.
-I see.

174
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,834
There's a rice cake shop over there.

175
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:17,737
Rice cakes from traditional markets
are always good.

176
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,106
-And this fruit shop…
-Yeah.

177
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,741
-…sells everything really cheap.
-Really?

178
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:22,976
They carry great produce.

179
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,046
-It looks good.
-Here we are.

180
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,149
-Bakery!
-Yes, another bakery.

181
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,217
-Here, hello.
-Hello.

182
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,519
Hello.

183
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,587
My favorite croquettes are from here.

184
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:35,722
Is that so?

185
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:39,526
And these are my mom’s favorite,
sweet red bean buns.

186
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:40,622
-Fried red bean buns?
-Yes.

187
00:07:40,982 --> 00:07:42,862
Would you like a croquette?

188
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,164
-That sounds great.
-Good.

189
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,365
One croquette, please.

190
00:07:46,962 --> 00:07:47,968
CROQUETTE

191
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,169
BREADED, DEEP-FRIED BUNS

192
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,037
STUFFED WITH GLASS NOODLES,
POTATO, OR KIMCHI

193
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,478
-Each shop does it differently.
-Right.

194
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:01,114
This one doesn’t have

195
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:03,650
-a potato-heavy filling like in Japan.
-Okay.

196
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,848
Instead, it’s got egg, onion,
and a hint of curry flavor.

197
00:08:07,392 --> 00:08:08,888
-Please try it.
-Okay.

198
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,031
What do you think?

199
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,736
It's nothing like the croquettes I know.

200
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:24,938
Potato salad?

201
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,273
It's like a donut
filled with potato salad.

202
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,610
So is it kind of like potato salad?

203
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:35,248
If they sold this in Japan,
it’d probably fall under curry bread.

204
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,384
-I see. Curry bread.
-Yes.

205
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,785
It's more like a curry bread.

206
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:46,092
This is the kind of thing
high schoolers would snack on

207
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:47,827
after club activities.

208
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:49,696
It's really good.

209
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:51,831
-Thank you.
-It's really good.

210
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,900
-When I first visited here…
-Yes?

211
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,835
-…this was 500 won, 50 yen.
-Alright.

212
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,204
-Now it's 1,000 won, 100 yen.
-That's still cheap.

213
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,439
-Right?
-Yes.

214
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,877
These are all good too.

215
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,378
These…

216
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:09,682
I loved Swiss rolls like this as a kid.

217
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,217
Really? Do you want to get one?

218
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,787
-Well… Should I?
-Sure.

219
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:14,988
We'll get one of these too.

220
00:09:16,118 --> 00:09:17,123
SWISS ROLL

221
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:20,126
-This looks amazing too.
-And this one also.

222
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:21,061
LONG BUTTERCREAM BUN

223
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,844
He really has a sweet tooth.
I recommend this one.

224
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,119
-What's that?
-Mammoth bread.

225
00:09:24,206 --> 00:09:25,094
RED BEAN MAMMOTH BREAD

226
00:09:25,244 --> 00:09:26,766
-Oh.
-Do they have this in Japan?

227
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,469
-I'm not sure.
-It's a crumble bun with everything in it.

228
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:30,837
Really?

229
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,672
Another after-school snack.

230
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:33,873
-And this one.
-That one too?

231
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,312
I had these as a kid.

232
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,948
-You did?
-It kind of tastes like chestnut, right?

233
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:42,982
-Right.
-Yeah.

234
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,818
-That'll be 3,000 won.
-I'll pay in cash.

235
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:45,752
Okay.

236
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,153
I can't wait to dig in.

237
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,688
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much!

238
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,192
He wants everything.

239
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,928
-You'd be troublesome as a son.
-Why?

240
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,896
-"I want this and that…"
-"I want this and that."

241
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:59,365
Even after paying, you still wanted more.

242
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:01,234
She's roasting seaweed. What's this?

243
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,836
-Hello.
-Hi, please try some.

244
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:03,770
Okay.

245
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,405
These are charcoal-roasted. Try one.

246
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,410
COSMETICS

247
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:13,713
What's going on,
selling seaweed at a cosmetic store?

248
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,415
-Isn't this a cosmetic shop?
-It is.

249
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:18,051
Times are tough for cosmetics…

250
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,353
-It is a cosmetic shop.
-Yes.

251
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,622
-But the cosmetics business is kind of…
-Really?

252
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,491
I guess seaweed sells better.

253
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,259
Want to try it?

254
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,128
Seaweed.

255
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:29,762
Thank you.

256
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,831
Thank you. Enjoy.

257
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:34,167
Freshly roasted seaweed is so good.

258
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,670
-Funny that they sell this on the side.
-Can we take a picture?

259
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:38,705
-Sure.
-May I?

260
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:39,639
Yes.

261
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,842
-Now I’m craving some rice.
-I agree.

262
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:44,310
COSMETIC SHOP'S SIDE GIG… LOVE IT!

263
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,345
-Thank you.
-Enjoy!

264
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:47,714
Ready to go?

265
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,282
-Let’s drive over.
-Okay.

266
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:52,452
HEADING TO SI-KYUNG’S STUDIO

267
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,589
This is a year’s worth of dessert

268
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,691
for me.

269
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,094
-Thank you.
-Sure.

270
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:04,330
-Should I put it here?
-Yes, right there.

271
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,665
Alright, thank you.

272
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:06,966
-By the way…
-Yes?

273
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,334
…where are we?

274
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,471
This is a place where
I sometimes do live performances.

275
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,673
And when friends

276
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,543
or acquaintances drop by,
we hang out and sing together.

277
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:18,511
We can use the guitar.

278
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:20,213
-And…
-Even the grand piano?

279
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,981
Right, I play the piano here too.

280
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,318
Is this okay?
This feels like such a sacred room.

281
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:28,188
Are you sure it’s alright
to scatter sweets around?

282
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,223
-It’s okay to drop some.
-Really?

283
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,793
Is this a special kind of coffee?

284
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:38,398
There's a café
that only uses African beans.

285
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,600
It’s good.

286
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,869
-I got it from there.
-African coffee…

287
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:47,874
tends to have a strong fruity aroma.

288
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,475
-Isn't it nice?
-Yes, it is.

289
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,812
We have to rank them.

290
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,814
-Rank them?
-Yes.

291
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,850
WHICH YAKSU MARKET DESSERT
IS MR. MATJJIGAE'S FAVORITE?

292
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:59,786
-Let’s see.
-Okay.

293
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,121
-How about trying these two first?
-Sure.

294
00:12:05,545 --> 00:12:06,559
CANDIDATE 1.

295
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:08,928
CUSTARD AND RED BEAN CREAM BUN
TWO BUNS FROM PPANGGUMTEO

296
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,496
This one has fresh cream in it.

297
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,965
Custard bun and red bean cream bun.

298
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,435
The price is about the same
as other bakeries…

299
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,203
-Yes.
-…but it’s twice as heavy.

300
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,240
Try it.

301
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,642
-Just bite into it.
-Let me try tearing it.

302
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,210
Will it work?

303
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,329
I've never had anything like this.

304
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:48,001
It’s not as overwhelming as I thought.

305
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,569
-Right?
-Yeah.

306
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:51,371
But it’s not too light either.

307
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:53,239
And not overly sweet.

308
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:55,808
-Let me try this one too.
-Sure.

309
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:57,844
Is there red bean paste inside?

310
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,512
Just a little.

311
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,799
I can easily imagine the taste
of the red bean cream one.

312
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,501
I like this one better.

313
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:22,602
I see.

314
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:25,772
Red bean cream bread
is a common flavor in Japan, right?

315
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,340
-Yes, we have it in Japan too.
-Okay.

316
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:28,308
But the custard cream

317
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,743
-is a flavor unique to this bakery.
-I see.

318
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:34,314
-It's not even common in Korea?
-There are custard cream buns,

319
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,949
but you won't find one this thick.

320
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:43,256
CANDIDATE 2. LONG BUTTERCREAM BUN
BUN FILLED WITH DENSE BUTTERCREAM

321
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,791
What kind of cream is this?

322
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,326
Is this… Ah!

323
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:47,260
It's buttercream.

324
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:49,996
I probably shouldn't be
eating this much cream.

325
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,073
It feels like
I’m eating with a real expert.

326
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,974
A dessert expert.

327
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,143
A specialist, even.

328
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:05,945
-You know what?
-Yes?

329
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,114
It’s not as sweet as I expected.

330
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,950
-Really?
-Surprisingly not sweet at all.

331
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,885
-You’re right.
-Right?

332
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,655
-It just has that rich, buttery taste.
-Exactly.

333
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,157
The cream is really dense.

334
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:21,661
Even in Japan, buttercream isn’t
that popular these days,

335
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:24,163
but I actually like it quite a lot.

336
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:29,202
CANDIDATE 3: GURI BALL (BAM-GWAJA)
SOFT, SWEET COOKIES WITH CHESTNUT FLAVOR

337
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,805
-I was curious about this one too.
-Bam-gwaja.

338
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,006
Bam-gwaja?

339
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:37,276
Bam means chestnut,
and gwaja means cookie.

340
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,278
When I was a kid,

341
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:43,716
there were cookies baked with
chestnuts and white bean paste.

342
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,551
They were really popular.

343
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,756
Were they considered fancy?

344
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,791
Not really. You could find them
at any supermarket.

345
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:54,293
-At supermarkets?
-And at snack shops.

346
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,363
They were a bit smaller than this,
but they tasted the same.

347
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,033
It’s nostalgic.

348
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,771
Whenever I see them, I end up
buying them without even realizing it.

349
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:06,706
-I see.
-Yeah.

350
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:07,673
They taste good.

351
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,008
That's good to hear.

352
00:15:10,371 --> 00:15:12,078
CANDIDATE 4. CHAPSSAL DONUT

353
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:14,447
A CHEWY SIGNATURE DESSERT
OF KOREAN TRADITIONAL MARKETS

354
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,382
-This…
-Yes

355
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:20,453
Five for 2,000 won, 200 yen,
is unbelievable.

356
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,523
-This is mugwort flavor.
-Mugwort!

357
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,692
Does it taste like mugwort rice cake?

358
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,628
-This one?
-Yes.

359
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:31,931
Let me try one too.

360
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,673
The fillings are good,

361
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:45,278
but the plain one alone is impressive.

362
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,413
On our way here,

363
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,782
he couldn't stop feeding
the staff from Japan,

364
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:50,983
saying it's delicious.

365
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:53,286
The staff loved it too.

366
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:58,991
WHAT'S MR. MATJJIGAE'S
FAVORITE DESSERT FROM YAKSU MARKET?

367
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:02,528
The one that surprised me the most
with the first bite was…

368
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:08,701
-The chapssal donut.
-I thought so.

369
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,737
-The glutinous rice donuts.
-Oh.

370
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,105
Chapssal donut is his favorite.

371
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:16,515
MATJJIGAE'S FAVORITE
PLAIN CHAPSSAL DONUT

372
00:16:16,865 --> 00:16:18,244
So here's the thing.

373
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:22,648
I want to invite the shop owners to Japan.

374
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:25,585
-And open a shop near Harajuku.
-You think this would sell?

375
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,287
I was wondering
how much it would sell for there,

376
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,553
-so I did the math.
-Okay.

377
00:16:29,903 --> 00:16:32,525
-Was it five for 200 yen?
-Yes.

378
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,494
You could easily charge
three times that price.

379
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:38,097
So over 100 yen per piece?

380
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,433
Yes. You could sell it for that much!

381
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,634
I'm quite sure.

382
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,871
-I think I kind of understand you…
-What?

383
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,239
…a little better now.

384
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:47,306
-Really?
-Yes.

385
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,575
When you decide on something,
you go all in.

386
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,477
-I do.
-You believe in yourself.

387
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,446
-Yes.
-Once he's sure, he doesn't waver.

388
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,614
Right.

389
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,682
But before he gets to that point,

390
00:16:57,232 --> 00:16:58,718
-he tries everything.
-Exactly.

391
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:01,888
-Recently I directed a movie.
-Yes.

392
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,824
-If I waver, it affects the whole team.
-That’s true.

393
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,993
When the staff ask me,
"What should we choose?"

394
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:10,530
I say, "This is definitely good."
"Right? I told you."

395
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:14,100
In the end, I have to make the call

396
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,869
and share that with others.

397
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:19,772
If I hesitate too long,
the whole crew is stuck.

398
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,107
Right, since you're the director.

399
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,110
Do you take other people's input
when writing songs?

400
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:26,779
-When they give me suggestions…
-Yes?

401
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:30,983
…I consider them,
but the responsibility is on me.

402
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,351
-Right.
-So the decision is mine.

403
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,254
Was it the eighth album?

404
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:36,255
-Mine?
-Yes.

405
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:39,025
-Is the song I Love U from that album?
-Yes.

406
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,093
You took it in a direction
you don’t normally take.

407
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,096
Yeah, I wanted to try
putting out a dance track.

408
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,532
-I really liked it.
-Thank you.

409
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:47,667
-It’s great.
-You listened to it!

410
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:52,305
-Throwing in such a curveball…
-Yes.

411
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:53,973
It was really refreshing.

412
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,741
-Thank you.
-Did you take a risk?

413
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,945
-Or was it someone else's idea?
-No, that was all me.

414
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:02,281
When you do the same thing repeatedly,

415
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:03,616
-it gets boring.
-Yes.

416
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:05,918
-For both fans and me.
-Right.

417
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:08,621
-About two years ago…
-Yes.

418
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,189
…I tried being a DJ.

419
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:15,061
-You did?
-It’s kind of odd, isn’t it?

420
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,431
-At the Summer Sonic.
-I know that festival.

421
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,967
I performed there.

422
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,235
-As DJ Matjji?
-As a DJ.

423
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,771
DJ Hoho.

424
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,974
That's my DJ name.

425
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,209
-You know Gen Hoshino.
-Ah, Gen Hoshino.

426
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,745
He curated one of the days
for the festival,

427
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,581
and asked me,
"Would you like to try DJing?"

428
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,183
So, over a short period,

429
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,285
I took lessons

430
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:43,322
and practiced with a full set
for a month straight.

431
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:44,890
-It was…
-Is it on YouTube?

432
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,728
There might be a video on YouTube…

433
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:49,996
I have some photos, though.

434
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:55,134
-You were in the zone.
-Yeah.

435
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:56,836
I was desperate.

436
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:04,243
-He's totally immersed.
-It was incredibly fun.

437
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,079
There were ten thousand people

438
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,016
in front of me.

439
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:11,851
It felt amazing.

440
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,420
-Really amazing. A first for me.
-Weren’t you nervous?

441
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:18,224
I wasn’t nervous.
I just didn’t want to look dumb.

442
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:22,895
Seeing ten thousand people
moving together like that…

443
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:26,499
You never experience that
when you're acting.

444
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,202
The groove was
completely different from acting.

445
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:33,572
And performing on a stage that huge…

446
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,474
-That rarely happens.
-And standing up there…

447
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,045
If you're open to it,

448
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:41,947
I'd love to collaborate with DJ Matjjigae.

449
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,350
I get a little wild, you know.

450
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:49,321
Doom doom da, doom doom da.

451
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:50,756
Du-du-du-du-du bam!

452
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,191
Doom doom da, doom doom da.

453
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,727
-I’m actually getting excited now.
-I'm wilder than I look.

454
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:00,032
THE NEXT INSANELY GOOD SPOT

455
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:01,300

FUKUOKA
