00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:05,772
K-foodie meets J-foodie.

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,040
This is insane.

3
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:13,614
-We are at Pildong, Chungmu-ro.
-Yes.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,449
-This place is called Pildong.
-Yes.

5
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:16,383
PILDONG MYEONOK

EPISODE 8
"ADDICTIVE LOVE" – PYEONGYANG COLD NOODLES

9
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:33,901
Is this a tourist spot?

10
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:36,603
No, surprisingly,
this is actually the central area.

11
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,172
-Do you see the N Seoul Tower behind us?
-Yes.

12
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,775
It used to be called Namsan Tower.

13
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:43,911
It’s now called N Seoul Tower,
though the rename…

14
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:45,212
-Yes.
-…wasn’t recent.

15
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,681
-N Seoul Tower? Really?
-Yes. N Seoul Tower.

16
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:49,349
-You can see the night view…
-Yes.

17
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:53,220
-…and that round part rotates.
-Wow.

18
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:56,657
So guys take their girlfriends there.

19
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,225
-I haven’t, though.
-It's a date spot?

20
00:00:58,292 --> 00:00:59,159
-Yes.
-Oh…

21
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,495
Don't be so sad. I'll go with you.

22
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,330
-Really?
-Yes.

23
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,566
-I'll have to leave early, though.
-That's fine.

24
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:10,938
-My parents came here…
-Yes.

25
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,440
-…when they used to date.
-Oh.

26
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:18,412
Then it's a place that's been around
since your parents' youth.

27
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,081
Yes, I used to eat there when I was young.

28
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:22,649
I see.

29
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:25,185
-It has a very mild flavor…
-Yes.

30
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,487
-…so even kids like it.
-Is that so?

31
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,523
So Koreans eat cold noodles

32
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,159
even in the winter.

33
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,094
-It's served in cold broth.
-Yes.

34
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:37,097
-So it might seem more suitable in summer.
-Yes.

35
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:40,734
But some say that it tastes
way better in winter.

36
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,135
Is that so?

37
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:44,805
-Shall we go in?
-I'd like to know why.

38
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,174
-This place looks cool.
-Yes.

39
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,476
-It's pretty old.
-It has a history.

40
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:50,978
-Shall we go in?
-Let's go.

41
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,349
-Hello.
-You can go to the second floor.

42
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,784
-Hello.
-Hello.

43
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,553
Everyone seems to be enjoying it.

44
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,590
-Here?
-Yes. Have a seat.

45
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:07,394
Even at this time of day,
downstairs is full

46
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,930
of people eating cold noodles.

47
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:12,799
You have to wait in line
for at least 30 minutes during the summer.

48
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,401
Oh…

49
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,103
-Shall we order?
-Yes.

50
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:18,772
-We'll have some jeyuk…
-Yes.

51
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:21,208
-…and some dumplings and chat a bit.
-Yes.

52
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:22,776
-Then we'll order cold noodles.
-Okay.

53
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,711
DUMPLINGS: 15,000 WON
JEYUK: 30,000 WON

54
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,680
-We'll have one jeyuk.
-Yes.

55
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:28,615
-Also one dish of dumplings.
-Okay.

56
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,353
-Do you need non-alcoholic beer?
-Soju is fine.

57
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,389
-Really? Okay.
-Yes. Soju.

58
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:38,358
-One bottle of soju, please.
-Sure.

59
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:39,760
-Thank you.
-Hello.

60
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,028
-Hello.
-Hello.

61
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,696
Here.

62
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,033
-Wow, what's this?
-Here's your noodle water.

63
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,602
It’s the water used to boil the noodles.

64
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,237
-Like sobayu?
-Yes.

65
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,139
-They give it to you at the start?
-Yes.

66
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:57,010
SOBAYU: WATER USED TO BOIL SOBA NOODLES
IT'S USUALLY SERVED AFTER THE MEAL

67
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,112
-It's warm.
-That's good.

68
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,881
-Let's drink.
-It's perfect for cold weather.

69
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,215
Thank you.

70
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,993
This tastes interesting.

71
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:16,630
-You've never had it in Korea, right?
-Right, it's my first time.

72
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:20,667
Fascinating. Shall we have soju next?

73
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,270
Thank you.

74
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,639
-Don't drink too much.
-I won't.

75
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,441
-Just lick it.
-I will.

76
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:28,975
Thank you.

77
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,447
-So your parents were regulars here?
-Yes.

78
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,582
So, since elementary school, I've had…

79
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,617
-You had cold noodles?
-Yes.

80
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:41,021
-Back in the day, the owner…
-Yes.

81
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:43,857
-…always sat at the very back.
-Yes.

82
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,959
-At the back?
-He sat there and read the newspaper.

83
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:48,695
-Even when people were lined up waiting.
-Is that so?

84
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,965
Back then, the cold noodles cost
a few hundred won.

85
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,267
-It was cheap?
-Yes, the price…

86
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,702
My father told me this.

87
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:57,904
-There used to be something called Minja.
-Minja?

88
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,606
If you order Minja, you get

89
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,808
-twice the noodles with no toppings.
-Yes.

90
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:04,177
-Oh…
-You'd only get noodles and broth.

91
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:09,249
Koreans usually greeted others
by asking if they had eaten,

92
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,184
-instead of saying "Hello."
-I see.

93
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,352
It was like that

94
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,822
-around 40 to 50 years ago.
-Yes.

95
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:21,394
So I’d just get extra noodles.

96
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:24,030
-Oh…
-No meat and no eggs.

97
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,800
-I just wanted more noodles.
-I see.

98
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,835
You must’ve grown up thinking this was

99
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,104
what cold noodles are supposed to be.

100
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:33,874
-I tried everything here.
-When you were young?

101
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,309
-Yes, this was my main spot…
-Yes.

102
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,145
-…so when you first…
-Yes.

103
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,147
-…try cold noodles here…
-Yes.

104
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:41,915
-…it naturally tastes good to you.
-I get it.

105
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,184
-But Pyeongyang cold noodles…
-Yes.

106
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,886
-…all taste different.
-Is that so?

107
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,622
-Hold on. I'm sorry.
-Yes?

108
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,891
But to Japanese people,

109
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,392
cold noodles are a dish you have

110
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,494
-at the end of a yakiniku meal.
-Right.

111
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:55,962
So, "Do you want bibimbap?"

112
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,198
-"Or gukbap? Cold noodles?"
-Yes.

113
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,434
-"Or yukgaejang?"
-Yes. It's one of those.

114
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:05,172
I'm sorry, but all cold noodles
tasted the same for me.

115
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,107
I hope that changes for you today.

116
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:08,775
-Today…
-Is the broth different?

117
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:10,110
It is different.

118
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,347
-I heard they mix meat broth…
-Yes.

119
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:17,684
-…and dongchimi broth.
-I see.

120
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,954
There are a lot
of cold noodle places these days.

121
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:23,089
-They serve really good cold noodles.
-Yes.

122
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,958
But I think this place is the best.

123
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,961
-Is that so?
-It is addicting.

124
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,263
-I wonder why.
-Your first experience is important.

125
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,600
-I see.
-That's why I had to bring you here.

126
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,135
-Amazing.
-Yes.

127
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:36,770
I'm sorry.

128
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:39,372
-Japanese people don't know much about it.
-Good.

129
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:42,042
I'm drooling as we're talking about it.

130
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,577
Really? Because you want to eat it?

131
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:44,778
-Like a dog.
-Like a dog.

132
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:46,646
Right.

133
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:47,914
It's here!

134
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:50,750
-It's here.
-Thank you.

135
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:51,751
-Thank you.
-Sure.

136
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:59,559
DUMPLINGS: 15,000 WON
APPROXIMATELY 1,500 YEN

137
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,228
-What is this?
-Here.

138
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,662
-This is jeyuk.
-I see.

139
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:03,797
Oh…

140
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:09,102
JEYUK: 30,000 WON
APPROXIMATELY 3,000 YEN

141
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:11,972
-Is it steamed pork?
-It's similar to bossam.

142
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,040
-Yes.
-They boil the pork

143
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:17,377
then press it down with something heavy.

144
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:20,347
-The oil gets released, making it chewy.
-I see.

145
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:21,848
Oh…

146
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,084
-Shall we have jeyuk first?
-Shall we? Okay.

147
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,419
You dip it in the sauce.
You can add mustard

148
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,255
if you like.

149
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,756
-Here?
-Would you like some?

150
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,791
-Yes, I'll try some.
-Okay.

151
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:37,497
You always get sauce with Korean dishes.

152
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,232
-Like this.
-Yes.

153
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:42,636
-When I make bossam…
-Yes.

154
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:46,306
-…in Tokyo, Japan…
-Yes.

155
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,041
…I dip it in vinegar and mustard.

156
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:50,510
-Really?
-Yes. That's how I like it.

157
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,913
-Thank you for the food.
-That's nice. Enjoy.

158
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,325
-The texture is nice, right?
-It's good.

159
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:09,763
Bossam has a very soft texture.

160
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:14,000
This feels like it’s been pressed
with a weight to drain the oil.

161
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,671
-Almost like it’s been pickled.
-That’s why they say

162
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,706
-the flavor becomes more concentrated.
-Yes.

163
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,375
-Applying pressure…
-Yes.

164
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,743
-…and letting it sit…
-Yes.

165
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,946
-…gives it more bounce…
-Right.

166
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:29,849
-…and enhances the savory flavor.
-Yes.

167
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:31,418
Oh…

168
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,387
-Can I try vinegar and mustard?
-I want to try too.

169
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,290
I've never tried that combination.

170
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:40,226
I think vinegar and mustard will be good.

171
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,362
This isn’t really
a Japanese palate thing, right?

172
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:44,397
-It's just how you like it, right?
-Yes.

173
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,465
I see.

174
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,737
BIG BRO MATJJIGAE'S SAUCE RECOMMENDATION
VINEGAR AND MUSTARD

175
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:55,241
Try it. It's good.

176
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,243
I've never tried it like this.

177
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:04,417
-How is it?
-Nice.

178
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,052
-It's good, right?
-Yes.

179
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,355
This is good.

180
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,990
Because the meat can be oily.

181
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,194
-The oily flavor becomes mild.
-Yes.

182
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:19,132
-I eat dumplings like this too.
-I see.

183
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,236
This kimchi is mild.

184
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:31,778
-It's mild and fermented well.
-Yes.

185
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,246
This is good.

186
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:35,815
-But kimchi with vinegar and mustard…
-Yes?

187
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,250
-…will be too sour.
-Right.

188
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,586
-So you normally…
-Yes.

189
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,688
-…dip it in the sauce.
-You change the flavor.

190
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,423
-Wrap it in kimchi.
-I see.

191
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,658
-Then eat it like this.
-Like this?

192
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:53,633
Korean people like to wrap things.

193
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:55,869
I guess so.

194
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,576
-We like to wrap everything.
-You do.

195
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,517
-Are these dumplings?
-Yes. Mandu.

196
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,619
Mandu. So it's different from gyoza.

197
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,155
-You dip it in that.
-This one?

198
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,023
I want to try the vinegar and mustard.

199
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,029
-Nice.
-It's delicious.

200
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,864
-It's good.
-I'm glad.

201
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,140
-This sauce goes well with everything.
-Yes.

202
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,243
Vinegar and mustard.
I learned something new today.

203
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:42,749
-It's good.
-It's delicious.

204
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:43,817
-Nice.
-Yes.

205
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,985
-You taught me vinegar and mustard.
-Yes.

206
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,688
-So I'll teach you this.
-Yes.

207
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:50,290
-You eat half the dumpling.
-Yes.

208
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,692
-Then eat the other half with jeyuk.
-Eat it together.

209
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:55,095
-It's good like this.
-Oh!

210
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,670
You eat it like this.

211
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:18,451
Eating half the dumpling
with jeyuk and kimchi is really good.

212
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:20,620
It's like the flavor is multiplying.

213
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:21,888
It's good.

214
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,156
Yes.

215
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:28,161
Oh!

216
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,130
You're so into the vinegar
and mustard right now.

217
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,699
-I've never had it before.
-There might be

218
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:34,734
a revolution in Korea today.

219
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,070
Vinegar and mustard with dumplings.

220
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,171
-Yes.
-Yes.

221
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:41,241
-By Yutaka Matsushige.
-Yutaka Matsushige. Yes.

222
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,143
Vinegar mustard is the best!

223
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,678
-Oh!
-You can advertise it.

224
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,348
Then only Japanese people
would understand.

225
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:49,349
That won't do.

226
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:55,155
-He's really enjoying the dumplings.
-Yes.

227
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,023
-Do you like the dumplings?
-What?

228
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,491
They're delicious.

229
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,161
-It's…
-I'm eating quite a bit today.

230
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,462
I don't know why, though.

231
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,001
I'm really glad.

232
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:11,604
I'm going to get full
before the cold noodles get here.

233
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,641
But when you have cold noodles,
you have to eat only the cold noodles.

234
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:15,675
Is that so?

235
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:18,111
You can't have cold noodles
and dumplings together.

236
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,480
-You have to focus.
-Otherwise, it'll get bloated.

237
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:21,981
-Oh…
-Yes.

238
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:24,417
-Shall we have cold noodles now?
-Shall we?

239
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:26,319
-Okay.
-There are two kinds.

240
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:29,656
-I recommend the one with the broth.
-Okay.

241
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,558
-One with broth?
-Yes.

242
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,559
-Excuse me!
-The broth…

243
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,927
-The broth is good.
-Yes?

244
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:35,828
-Two cold noodles with broth, please.
-Sure.

245
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,030
COLD NOODLES: 15,000 WON

246
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,869
Gosh, I keep drooling.

247
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:43,903
-What?
-I keep drooling.

248
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,305
-You keep drooling?
-Yes.

249
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,241
It happens when you
think about cold noodles, right?

250
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,410
-Right.
-Yes.

251
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,947
-Why?
-Because I'm addicted to them.

252
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,416
-When I was in the military…
-Yes.

253
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,884
…I craved two things.

254
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,386
The first was iced coffee.

255
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:04,324
-Oh…
-The second was this broth.

256
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:07,527
You drink the broth?

257
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:09,095
You chug it down.

258
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,197
-You chug it.
-If you can.

259
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:12,632
Is that so?

260
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:14,334
-I'm excited.
-Well…

261
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,336
-Japanese people…
-Yes?

262
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:20,139
They probably wouldn't even imagine
drinking the broth.

263
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:21,908
Well, it's good broth…

264
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:24,110
-Broth…
-Of course, there's a bit of seasoning.

265
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:27,013
-But it's not all artificial.
-Oh…

266
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:31,751
The cold noodle dessert at yakiniku
places usually comes with broth, kimchi,

267
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:32,952
-and vinegar.
-Yes.

268
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:35,255
They all have the same flavor.

269
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:38,258
If you compare it to the cold noodle
dessert at yakiniku places…

270
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:40,893
-Yes.
-If those are like…

271
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,363
-How do I put this… McDonald's…
-Yes.

272
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,199
Pyeongyang cold noodles are like
handmade burgers. It's different.

273
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,467
-Oh…
-Right.

274
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,235
-Before we eat the noodles…
-Yes?

275
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:50,870
-…I have to warn you.
-Warn me?

276
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,373
Some people say
Pyeongyang cold noodles are bland.

277
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:54,941
-When they first try them?
-Yes.

278
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:57,644
Yes, but I still recommend
you do not add any seasonings.

279
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:01,047
-It's here.
-It's here.

280
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,248
-It's here.
-Yes.

281
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:11,958
COLD NOODLES WITH BROTH: 15,000 WON
APPROXIMATELY 1,500 YEN

282
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:15,862
-They mix meat broth…
-Yes.

283
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:19,799
-…and kimchi broth.
-Wow.

284
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,202
-It looks completely different.
-Yes.

285
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:24,837
-You can have it like this.
-Right.

286
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,940
-Try the broth first.
-Broth first?

287
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:29,642
-Drink it just like this?
-Yes, the spoon…

288
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,944
They don't have spoons here.

289
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:33,446
They don't?

290
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:34,781
SI-KYUNG'S WAY OF EATING

291
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,983
STEP ONE, DRINK THE BROTH FIRST

292
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:39,752
Wow…

293
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,101
Wow.

294
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,404
The flavor is so deep.

295
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:02,141
-Then you mix the noodles.
-Yes.

296
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,110
-This is amazing.
-Yes.

297
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,480
-Then you go like this.
-Yes.

298
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:13,886
The noodles are quite long.

299
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:26,366
It's delicate.

300
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,870
I can see why some people
might think it's bland.

301
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,038
Yes.

302
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,992
It is hard

303
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,295
to describe the flavor of the broth.

304
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:02,869
There is a deep flavor in the broth.

305
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:04,771
-Right. It's just as you said.
-Right?

306
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:07,540
It's nice to savor the taste as I eat it.

307
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,842
-A chef once said this.
-Yes?

308
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,312
Normally, when you taste something
you can immediately tell

309
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:16,182
-if it's sweet, spicy, or salty.
-Yes.

310
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,984
-It's easy to distinguish the flavor.
-Yes.

311
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:21,354
But this is the kind of dish
where you explore

312
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,756
-and discover the flavor yourself.
-Yes.

313
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:27,460
-That's why it’s a true gourmet food.
-Right.

314
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,530
It's unlike any cold noodles
I've ever had before.

315
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:35,368
So most people don't say,

316
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,769
"What is this? It's good!"

317
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:37,937
-right away.
-Yes.

318
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:41,174
-They go, "What is this?"
-Gradually.

319
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,643
-"This is new. It's interesting."
-Yes.

320
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,345
-"It's deep. I'm not so sure about it."
-Yes.

321
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,247
-But if you come here 10 times…
-Yes.

322
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,550
-…it becomes really addictive.
-Right.

323
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,018
I get it.

324
00:15:57,557 --> 00:16:00,293
So this is what
little Si-kyung got addicted to.

325
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:02,028
-Yes.
-When you were young.

326
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,262
Yes.

327
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,671
-I think that will happen to me too.
-Wow.

328
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:15,007
-It's delicious.
-I'm happy.

329
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,310
In Korea, there’s
the “Three Great Cold Noodles.”

330
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:18,845
Jinju cold noodles from Jinju.

331
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:19,979
-It's in the south.
-Yes.

332
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,148
-Since it's in the south near the ocean…
-Yes.

333
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:25,451
-…they use seafood for the broth.
-The broth is different.

334
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:26,819
-Right.
-Oh…

335
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:27,787
Hamhung cold noodles.

336
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:29,989
Hamhung is in North Korea.

337
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,824
They add potato starch to the noodles.

338
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:34,627
-It makes it very chewy.
-Wow…

339
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,529
And here they have
Pyeongyang Cold Noodles.

340
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:38,264
-Pyeongyang Cold Noodles.
-Yes.

341
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,801
How do you add more flavor to this?

342
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:45,838
-You can add some chili powder.
-This?

343
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,774
-It smells nice.
-It changes the flavor.

344
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,109
That's perfect.

345
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,079
SI-KYUNG'S WAY OF EATING
STEP TWO, ADD CHILI POWDER

346
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,865
The noodles,
which seemed expressionless at first,

347
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:16,002
slowly change as they absorb the broth.

348
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:18,337
-Oh, that's very poetic.
-Yes.

349
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:21,607
You gave life to the noodles.

350
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:24,010
Well, noodles are awesome.

351
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,219
-Wow.
-There's another way to change it.

352
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:37,557
-Yes?
-You crush the boiled egg yolk.

353
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,959
-It changes the broth again.
-Yes.

354
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:43,162
SI-KYUNG'S WAY OF EATING
STEP THREE, CRUSH THE EGG YOLK

355
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:45,364
But if you do it from the beginning…

356
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:46,966
-It makes it murky?
-Yes.

357
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:48,167
-Right.
-Yes.

358
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:02,582
This is top-tier,
even among noodle dishes.

359
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,584
-I'm glad you like it.
-Yes.

360
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:08,988
Can I add some vinegar?

361
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:11,390
-No.
-No? I can't?

362
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:12,758
-Of course you can.
-Yes.

363
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:13,893
-I can?
-Go ahead.

364
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,029
-It's your preference.
-Yes.

365
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,632
I want to change the flavor.

366
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,368
Oh…

367
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,706
-Nice.
-He finished it.

368
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,474
He had one more dumpling than me.

369
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,543
-Are you okay?
-What do you mean?

370
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,712
Aren't you eating too much?
Will you be okay?

371
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:35,815
-I have quite the appetite today.
-Oh…

372
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,416
Is it because it's good?

373
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:43,789
-My parents are quite old now.
-Yes.

374
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:45,691
-But they can finish the whole bowl.
-Really?

375
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:48,461
-How old are they?
-They are…

376
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:52,999
-They were born in 1945, 46.
-So almost 80.

377
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,266
-Right.
-Yes.

378
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,168
-They're 80 this year.
-Yes.

379
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,470
-I just remembered…
-Yes?

380
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,805
In Japan, we talked about

381
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,741
-what it is to be a gourmet.
-Yes.

382
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:04,710
But you seem to have a curiosity

383
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:07,880
about different flavors.

384
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,351
-You don't accept the flavor as it is.
-Yes.

385
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,987
-You keep thinking about…
-Yes.

386
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:16,989
…adding seasonings
and changing the flavor.

387
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:18,691
-You are a gourmet.
-Yes.

388
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,394
But some gourmets
don’t hesitate to spend big

389
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:25,297
when it comes to good food.

390
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,533
-Yes.
-They spend a lot of money…

391
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,168
-Yes.
-…on fine dining.

392
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,171
-I'm not like that.
-Me either.

393
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:37,343
I want to understand
what makes a certain flavor

394
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:41,047
so beloved by locals for decades.

395
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:44,083
I think that's what being a gourmet is.
So I want to ask,

396
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:48,120
what is it about the flavor
of these noodles

397
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,256
-that makes them so loved by locals…
-Yes.

398
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:53,125
…including you and your parents,

399
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,594
for the past 40 years?

400
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,597
Knowing the answer to that question
is the happiness

401
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,133
-that comes from good food.
-Oh…

402
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,568
-It's just like you said.
-It's memorable.

403
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:03,669
-Yes.
-Oh.

404
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:08,007
If those who enjoy doing that
are called gourmets,

405
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:11,143
I think I would like to be called one.

406
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,211
Right.

407
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:16,015
I could eat some more.

408
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:19,385
-Can I order more?
-Really? What are you going to order?

409
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,987
-Excuse me!
-Yes?

410
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,322
One bisari, please.

411
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:25,291
-Sure.
-What is bisari?

412
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:29,795
-Spicy cold noodles, with just noodles.
-Oh.

413
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:30,996
Oh…

414
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,399
-No toppings.
-I see.

415
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:36,168
-They give you noodles…
-Yes.

416
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,704
-…without meat or eggs.
-Oh…

417
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,720
The broth is getting better by the minute.

418
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:55,955
-Really?
-Yes.

419
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,060
It's here.

420
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:03,429
-Thank you.
-Sure.

421
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:11,203
SPICY NOODLES: 10,000 WON
APPROXIMATELY 1,000 YEN

422
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,807
-They add a lot of sesame oil.
-Oh…

423
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:17,309
-Try some.
-Should I?

424
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:32,591
Wow.

425
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:35,394
It's sweeter than I thought.

426
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:38,063
-It is a bit sweet.
-Right? It's sweet.

427
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:40,099
The smell of sesame oil is amazing.

428
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,868
It tastes completely different.

429
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:44,403
Those who have cold noodles

430
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,306
-for the first time order spicy noodles…
-Yes.

431
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,008
…but fall in love with Pyeongyang ones.

432
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,176
Right.

433
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:58,717
-Then you wrap this…
-Yes.

434
00:21:58,784 --> 00:21:59,885
We keep wrapping food.

435
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:02,321
-You do like wrapping food.
-Yes.

436
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:05,124
-We want to wrap everything.
-Go ahead.

437
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:08,494
Oh.

438
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:14,500
Oh, I'm full.

439
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:15,868
-Yes.
-Right.

440
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:20,506
-Are you full right now?
-I am so full.

441
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,642
Just like earlier today,
it’s surprisingly easy to digest.

442
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:24,977
Maybe it's because it's so good.

443
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,613
-You digest quickly if the food is good?
-Yes.

444
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,649
-I've never heard that before.
-For real.

445
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,552
-That is a new theory.
-When it’s really good,

446
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,487
it feels like your body just kicks out

447
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,189
-a bunch of digestive enzymes like…
-Oh…

448
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:41,126
“Alright, let’s break this down
and move on to the next!”

449
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,695
And your stomach expands.

450
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:44,597
Like this.

451
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:46,498
You can't have cold noodles

452
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:49,668
-like this in Tokyo, Japan.
-Yes.

453
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:50,836
This is so good.

454
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:54,139
I'm jealous you got to have this
since you were a kid.

455
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:56,642
You also made memories with your parents.

456
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,411
-I want to have it until the day I die.
-You do?

457
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:02,948
You would be so sad
if this restaurant were to shut down.

458
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,683
Yes.

459
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:08,120
I like going to unfamiliar places,

460
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:09,521
going to unfamiliar restaurants

461
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,257
-and having good food.
-Yes.

462
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:14,793
-Someday, we should go on a drive…
-Yes.

463
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:18,631
…to an unfamiliar place
and find good restaurants.

464
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,165
-That sounds nice.
-Yes.

465
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:23,168
We would wander around
looking for good food.

466
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:26,438
You're already coming up
with a new program idea.

467
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:28,340
I want to do it. Yes.

468
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,176
Anyway, I'm very satisfied
with filming in Korea.

469
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:34,280
-But it's just the beginning.
-It is the beginning.

470
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:37,249
-Thank you.
-My standards are getting higher.

471
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:39,418
If we keep eating good food like this…

472
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:40,352
-Tomorrow…
-Well…

473
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,553
NEXT INSANELY GOOD SPOT

00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,061
