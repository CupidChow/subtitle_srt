13
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:37,237
So where are we?

14
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:38,772
-We are in Gangnam.
-Yes.

15
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,942
-Do office workers come here?
-Yes.

16
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:45,012
-There are a lot of companies around here.
-I see.

17
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:48,916
That’s why this place gets packed
with office workers at lunchtime.

18
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,685
And a lot of people
come to drink here at night.

19
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,053
Is that so?

20
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:55,322
Speaking in terms of age,

21
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,591
I’m four years older than this shop.

22
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:59,459
Then… What?

23
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:02,262
-So it's been around for about 40 years?
-Yes.

24
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:05,098
-Where is it? Here?
-Here. Hanseong Kal-guksu.

25
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,437
I've been saving this place so I can

26
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:12,105
introduce it on my YouTube channel.

27
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,408
-But you're revealing it here?
-Yes. Just for you.

28
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:17,144
Hanseong Kal-guksu has better pancakes.

29
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,746
It's as good as
Hanseong Kal-guksu's jeyuk.

30
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:23,150
The beef plate suyuk is amazing.
It's similar to Hanseong Kal-guksu's.

and they said they’re bracing for it

33
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,756
because I've mentioned them a lot.

34
00:01:29,827 --> 00:01:32,025
SI-KYUNG'S INSANELY GOOD SPOT
HE'S BEEN SAVING UNTIL NOW

35
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,527
-Hanseong Kal-guksu.
-Yes.

36
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:35,395
-I hope you enjoy it.
-Let's try it.

37
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:37,531
-Hanseong Kal-guksu.
-Yes.

38
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,333
-This place is good.
-I see.

HANSEONG KAL-GUKSU

40
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,171
There are quite a few people.

41
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:46,673
-It’s crowded every day.
-Is that so?

42
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:50,544
Amazing. Hello.

43
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:54,114
Hello.

44
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:55,849
Hello.

45
00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:00,020
-Amazing.
-That's kal-guksu.

46
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:01,688
-They're eating it.
-Yes.

47
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:04,925
People usually come here during
lunch hours to have kal-guksu.

48
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:08,195
-They offer more variety at night.
-There are a lot of dishes.

49
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,162
Yes.

50
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,532
Excuse me.

51
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:17,137
There are a lot of people here.

52
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:20,607
-It's not even noon yet.
-Right.

53
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:23,443
Since when did you start coming here?

54
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:25,545
-Since before I entered elementary school.
-Really?

55
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,147
My father

56
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:29,850
brought my grandfather
and grandmother here

57
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,551
-to be a good son.
-I see.

58
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,220
-So three generations came together.
-Yes.

59
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,689
-That's what this restaurant is like.
-Is that so?

60
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,159
I’m really proud that

61
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:43,664
there’s such a great place like this
representing Korean cuisine.

62
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:46,266
But this place is a bit expensive.

63
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,567
I see.

64
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:50,437
-There are various dishes.
-Yes.

65
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:54,508
-They're all really good.
-Where's the kal-guksu?

66
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,243
It's on the top right of the menu board.

67
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:57,177
KAL-GUKSU

68
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:58,845
-Oh, 11,000 won.
-Yes.

69
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,448
Kal-guksu cost around 6,000 won

70
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,216
in 2010.

71
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:06,586
The price has almost doubled

72
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,389
-in 15 years.
-I see.

73
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,392
By the way, have you ever tried
standing soba in Japan?

74
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:13,960
I have.

75
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,263
-The owner makes it by himself.
-And serves it right away.

76
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,331
-That's about 350 yen.
-It's pretty good.

77
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:23,203
It’s more about quickly filling
your stomach rather than

78
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,039
-sitting down to enjoy a delicious meal.
-Right. To fill your stomach.

79
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:28,175
It truly is "fast food."

80
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:31,845
Kal-guksu is a dish that really has to be
made with care and dedication.

81
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:34,181
-The broth and the noodles.
-I see.

82
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:37,150
There are different kinds of broth

83
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,452
such as beef broth,

84
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,053
beef bone broth,

85
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,722
and chicken broth.

86
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:44,224
In Japan, they rarely use

87
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,960
meat-based broth for udon or soba.

88
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:49,129
-Right.
-Yes.

89
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,132
-It's mostly seafood-based.
-Right.

90
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,333
Some use vegetable broth.

91
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,938
-They use beef plate broth here.
-Wow…

92
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,240
It's a slightly more expensive,
refined flavor.

93
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,310
I wouldn't say this restaurant is casual.

94
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,411
-It's formal.
-Yes.

95
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,313
We are also dressed formally today.

96
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,814
We dressed differently than usual.

97
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,716
-I feel awkward.
-Awkward?

98
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:12,786
-Two men wearing suits…
-Why is that awkward?

99
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,888
I'm not the type to dress up.

100
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,990
I didn't think you dressed up.

101
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,759
-Really?
-We're just wearing suits.

102
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:19,893
This is you dressing up?

103
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,896
Well, you're stylish

104
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:25,866
-and into fashion.
-Are you not confident in your style?

105
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,834
-Not one bit.
-How come?

106
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:31,071
You have a broad chest,

107
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,840
so you look good in a suit.

108
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:38,745
-Don’t you check yourself in the mirror?
-Should I wear it on YouTube?

109
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:42,048
-After working out every day?
-No, I don't look in the mirror.

110
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,483
-You don't look in the mirror?
-No.

111
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,153
-Then why do you go to the gym?
-I just like working out.

112
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,389
-And getting a good sweat in.
-And after the muscle pump?

113
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:52,559
-I might just glimpse at myself.
-So you do look.

114
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,161
-When I shower--
-You do, for sure.

115
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,796
But I don’t stare into the mirror.

116
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,697
-Like this.
-I don't do that.

117
00:04:58,165 --> 00:04:59,332
-And like this.
-What is that?

118
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,569
-You watch yourself…
-I really don't.

119
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,137
-Hello.
-Hello.

120
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:05,138
-Hello.
-Hello.

121
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:06,173
-It's been a while.
-Yes.

122
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,576
-I'm sure you're busy. Thank you for this.
-No problem. Thank you for coming.

123
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:13,113
Wow, side dishes
served at a kal-guksu place!

124
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:15,682
We'll have…

125
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:16,616
ORDER SLIP

126
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,385
-…a small suyuk, a small jeyuk…
-Yes.

127
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,687
…stir-fried octopus,
and assorted pancakes.

128
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:21,955
-That's it.
-Okay.

129
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:23,390
KAL-GUKSU?

130
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:25,859
-Didn't we come here to have kal-guksu?
-No.

131
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:27,527
What’s funny about this place is that

132
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,830
it’s called Hanseong Kal-guksu,

133
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:31,531
but kal-guksu isn’t their main dish.

134
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,134
It’s not bad,

135
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:35,936
but no one comes here
just for the kal-guksu.

136
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,672
Aren’t you being a little too blunt?

137
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,240
No, it's what the owner says.

138
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:42,175
The owner shouldn't be saying that.

139
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:44,144
-But everyone knows it.
-Really?

140
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:45,979
So you eat the kal-guksu last.

141
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:48,248
-Yes.
-People just end up ordering it.

142
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,883
They just end up ordering it?

143
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:53,553
There are better
kal-guksu places than here.

144
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,356
Then let's go there. Why are we here?

145
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,024
Everything is delicious here.

146
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:01,294
Their boiled meat is better than
the places that specialize in it,

147
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:04,598
and the stir-fried octopus is
as good as any specialty restaurant.

148
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,868
And their pancakes taste
just as good as a pancake specialty place.

149
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,536
That's their charm.

150
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:11,137
But it is quite pricey.

151
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,008
-Here's your suyuk.
-It's here.

152
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,843
This is top quality.

153
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,612
-This is beef.
-Yes.

154
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:19,846
-Beef suyuk.
-Yes.

155
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:21,514
-And this is pork.
-Pork.

156
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:25,719
Our kal-guksu is good,
but the other dishes are even better.

157
00:06:26,014 --> 00:06:28,308
JEYUK, SMALL
27,000 WON, 2,700 YEN

158
00:06:29,184 --> 00:06:31,691
SUYUK, SMALL
30,000 WON, 3,000 YEN

159
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:34,127
Is this bossam?
Or is it different from bossam?

160
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:36,529
This is called "jeyuk."

161
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:37,731
-Jeyuk?
-Yes.

162
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,433
-For bossam, you need bossam kimchi.
-There's kimchi right here.

163
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,035
This isn't bossam kimchi.

164
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,604
-What?
-Bossam kimchi tastes different.

165
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,206
It's a bit sweeter.

166
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:48,842
-There's a lot I don't know.
-So

167
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,344
you'd wrap the bossam
in kimchi and eat it.

168
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,013
-Yes.
-But for jeyuk,

169
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,215
you can dip it in salted shrimp

170
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:56,983
or wrap it in lettuce.

171
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:59,185
-Try some.
-Thank you for the food.

172
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,421
-Try dipping it in this sauce first.
-Here I go.

173
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:02,656
It's salted shrimp

174
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,391
which is fermented shrimp
preserved in salt.

175
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,143
-It's soft.
-Great.

176
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,714
-The salted shrimp is quite salty.
-Yes.

177
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,616
-But it is very flavorful.
-Yes.

178
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,622
Sorry, but I want to try
the lettuce wrap right away.

179
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,559
A piece of jeyuk

180
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,462
-and a clove of garlic dipped in ssamjang.
-Yes.

181
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:59,179
This is a flavor that never disappoints.

182
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,613
-Right?
-Yes.

183
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,283
I'm all charged up
and it's still the middle of the day.

184
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:05,385
-The fresh garlic…
-Yes.

185
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,920
…really makes a big difference.

186
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:14,594
-You wrap it like this…
-Yes.

187
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:17,030
You probably won't eat it…

188
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,565
-Yes.
-So I’ll eat it.

189
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,970
You don't like opening your mouth
when someone offers you food

190
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:26,573
and says, "open wide," right?

191
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,775
I don't like seeing
the other person's mouth half open

192
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,410
when they say, "open wide."

193
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,682
When they do that,

194
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,317
their face is just unsettling.

195
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:38,752
Open wide.

196
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,857
I don't think

197
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,092
I've ever had boiled beef before.

198
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,045
-This is so good.
-I'm glad.

199
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:06,946
This is delicious.

200
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,882
I love pork.

201
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:12,218
I love pig fat more than beef fat.

202
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:16,356
But the fat-to-meat ratio in this beef?

203
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:17,624
It’s perfect.

204
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,827
Beef plate is one of
the most premium cuts,

205
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,563
so it’s often used when making broth.

206
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,832
If you don't boil it for a long time,

207
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,400
it doesn't get as soft.

208
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:30,336
It can't get this soft
just by boiling it for an hour.

209
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,972
-It's soft.
-It's very classy.

210
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,375
-This place is amazing.
-I'm glad you like it.

211
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:37,444
Most restaurants we've been to

212
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,780
specialized in either beef or pork.

213
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,016
But they do both here
and they do them well.

214
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:45,518
Well, this place specializes in kal-guksu.

215
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:46,820
Right.

216
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,588
What?

217
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:50,723
-Are these pancakes?
-Yes.

218
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,658
They're pancakes.

219
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,060
ASSORTED PANCAKES, SMALL
26,000 WON, 2,600 YEN

220
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:56,062
They're assorted pancakes,
so there are shrimp,

221
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,765
-zucchini, fish…
-Yes.

222
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,233
…and oyster.

223
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,267
COD AND OYSTER

224
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:05,472
Japanese people only know pancakes

225
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,941
like okonomiyaki
served at yakiniku places.

226
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,477
It’s rare to see pancakes served like this

227
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,278
-as a standalone dish.
-I see.

228
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,514
-Any pancake specialty restaurants?
-No.

229
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,649
I'm not sure, but I don't think so.

230
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,552
-There are quite a few in Korea.
-Right.

231
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,522
-They have so many kinds of pancakes.
-I see.

232
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:25,792
-Shrimp.
-Yes, the shrimp pancake is delicious.

233
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:29,729
I can feel just how soft it is.

234
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:39,205
The shrimp inside is so soft.

235
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,642
I love these shrimp pancakes.

236
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,177
-The shrimp pancakes?
-Yes.

237
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:51,284
They’ve really mastered

238
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,853
-controlling the fire.
-Yes.

239
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,423
-It's perfectly medium rare.
-It's juicy, right?

240
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,858
So

241
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:02,428
if you don’t cook
the pancakes slowly over low heat,

242
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,197
-they might burn.
-Is that so?

243
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:06,366
That’s why good pancake places

244
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,368
always have a master.

245
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,236
-A pancake master?
-Yes.

246
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,207
-Is the batter…
-Yes?

247
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:17,243
-…made with eggs and flour?
-Yes. It's mostly eggs and flour.

248
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,079
-I see. Is this an oyster?
-Yes.

249
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:33,226
-The oyster pancake is so good.
-I'm glad.

250
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:34,827
You can only have it in winter.

251
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,830
This is delicious.

252
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,067
-You can't get it in Japan, right?
-No.

253
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:43,403
-There are oyster dishes in Japan…
-Yes.

254
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,905
…like fried oysters
or oysters with ponzu.

255
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:48,474
-Yes.
-But oyster pancakes are only in Korea.

256
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,177
I want to drink something.

257
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,012
-I'll drink--
-Non-alcoholic beer?

258
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:56,583
Don't you normally have
makgeolli with pancakes?

259
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,519
Yes, makgeolli with pancakes is a must.

260
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,888
-This one?
-All kinds of pancakes.

261
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:05,091
That’s why in Korea,
there’s such a strong association

262
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,026
between pancakes and makgeolli.

263
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,329
Yes. Let's have Si-kyung's makgeolli.

264
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,798
No, let's just have regular makgeolli.

265
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,266
I like Si-kyung's makgeolli.

266
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,902
-I don't want it to look like a plug.
-It's fine!

267
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:18,838
I'm sorry, but yours tastes better.

268
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,940
Then should I take mine out?

269
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,787
-Thank you.
-Here you go.

270
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:37,724
-Jjan.
-Jjan.

271
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,233
-It's totally different.
-I see.

272
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,003
-It's delicious.
-I'm glad.

273
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,905
-What was this?
-Cod.

274
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,250
-Anyway…
-Yes?

275
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:07,987
What’s the reason pancakes
and makgeolli go so well together?

276
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:11,057
I don't know. I'm not sure.

277
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:16,162
-This combination is the flavor of Korea.
-I see.

278
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:20,099
This place truly has class.

279
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:22,969
Right? It makes you want to
bring someone here, right?

280
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:25,305
Whether it’s a business associate,
your parents,

281
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,006
-or your friends.
-Yes.

282
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,642
Pancakes have long been a must-have dish

283
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,711
in Korea for special occasions

284
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,780
-such as parties, festivals…
-Yes.

285
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,348
…or any kind of celebration.

286
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,450
The smell of oil was so strong,

287
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,319
the whole neighborhood
would know right away.

288
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,054
Like, "Something good must have happened."

289
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:45,525
-Even if you aren’t used to Korean food…
-Yes.

290
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,927
-…this would be okay.
-It would be easy to have.

291
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,830
I don’t think anyone would feel
out of place here.

292
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,700
-It isn't an acquired taste.
-It isn't.

293
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,170
These dishes have raised my standards.

294
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,238
-Right.
-So now the kal-guksu…

295
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,509
Because of what you said,

296
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:06,145
I thought about
filling my stomach with just these.

297
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,281
Oh, you can totally do that.

298
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,616
Because the kal-guksu
isn't the star of the show.

299
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,518
-Is that so?
-It's more like a supporting role.

300
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,153
It's not that it's bad,

301
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,656
but the other dishes are so good.

302
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:19,492
The restaurant name kind of makes you go,

303
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,194
"Why is it called kal-guksu?"

304
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,128
HANGSEONG KAL-GUKSU?

305
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:25,565
The regulars won't get upset
even if I say that.

306
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:26,933
Is that so?

307
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,334
Your stir-fried octopus is here.

308
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,570
Oh, my. That is huge.

309
00:14:30,832 --> 00:14:33,573
STIR-FRIED OCTOPUS (PLUS NOODLES)
42,000 WON, 4,200 YEN

310
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:37,543
We'll have one kal-guksu,

311
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,545
-but can you split it into two bowls?
-Sure!

312
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,414
-It's delicious.
-Thank you.

313
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:43,916
Oh, you even learned the honorifics.

314
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,686
You can use past tense,
honorifics, and present tense.

315
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:48,755
-I memorized it.
-Yes.

316
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:49,856
There's mashitseupnida

317
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:51,190
-and mashiteotseupnida.
-Yes.

318
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,259
-Mashitseupnida means it's delicious.
-Yes.

319
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:56,396
-Mashiteotseupnida is the past tense.
-Like, "It was delicious"?

320
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:57,997
-Mashiteotseupnida.
-Yes.

321
00:14:58,464 --> 00:14:59,499
This is najjibokkeum.

322
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,967
-Pardon?
-Najjibokkeum.

323
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,835
-Nakjibokkeum.
-Najjibokkeum.

324
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,371
-Najjibokkeum.
-It's nakji.

325
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,340
-Nakji.
-Yes, nakji.

326
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,307
Bokkeum.

327
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,309
-Nakjibokkeum.
-Yes.

328
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,346
-Let's have nakjibokkeum.
-Yes. Let's.

329
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,249
-Octopus.
-Yes.

330
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,936
Wow, this octopus is delicious.

331
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:41,107
-What’s impressive about this place is…
-Yes.

332
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,643
-…how they control the fire.
-Yes.

333
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,045
-They controlled it perfectly.
-It can't get better--

334
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,181
-They are masters.
-Right.

335
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,117
-They brought it out at its absolute best.
-Yes.

336
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:52,251
-Right.
-They brought it out

337
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,687
right at that delicate point.
Any more heat and it would’ve

338
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:56,222
-gotten tough.
-Is that so?

339
00:15:56,823 --> 00:16:00,593
Anyway, the octopus is perfectly cooked.

340
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,695
This is also quite amazing.

341
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:05,031
I have never had
such delicious octopus before.

342
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,165
I'm glad.

343
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:10,336
You know,

344
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:12,605
cooking or stir-frying seafood like this

345
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:14,207
-is really tricky.
-Right.

346
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,509
And it has a smoky flavor, right?

347
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,845
-Yes.
-When it’s stir-fried,

348
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:22,315
-it naturally picks up that smoky flavor…
-Yes.

349
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,150
-…which makes it really appealing.
-Yes.

350
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,056
And it has noodles.

351
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,258
Yes, it's called "sari."

352
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,927
In Korea, we call
a bundle of noodles sari,

353
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,898
and there's a culture of adding sari
to almost any dish.

354
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:41,234
-I see.
-They normally add thin noodles,

355
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,536
but what makes this place
stand out is that…

356
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:45,471
-Yes.
-…they add kal-guksu noodles.

357
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:13,299
-But these kal-guksu noodles…
-Yes?

358
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,333
-Was it sari?
-Yes.

359
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:16,135
This is delicious.

360
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,503
-I'm glad.
-Yes.

361
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,439
This right here, just this one plate,

362
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,441
makes this place a specialty restaurant.

363
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,477
It's good.

364
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,546
But one problem is that…

365
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,349
eating it with these chopsticks is hard.

366
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,717
-Right.
-Yes.

367
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,252
Japanese people aren't used to it.

368
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:38,124
It's hard to pick up the noodles
with these thin metal chopsticks.

369
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,663
I think a lot of Japanese people

370
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,431
-will think this is spicy.
-Right. Yes.

371
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,568
I'm fine. It's really good.

372
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:50,036
This place is truly amazing.

373
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,170
-It's good, right?
-Yes.

374
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,039
The steps are amazing.

375
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,040
Yes.

376
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,842
The meat, the pancakes,

377
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,412
-and the octopus.
-Yes.

378
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:02,748
It’s not a consistent or uniform menu.

379
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,885
It feels like they're all from
different restaurants.

380
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:07,486
Right. Yes.

381
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,690
-That’s actually the charm of this place.
-It's amazing.

382
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,491
They have something special.

383
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:16,762
I'd like Japanese people to taste this.

384
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:20,166
This dish came together
in the most incredible way.

385
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:21,534
I'm glad.

386
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:23,135
But when you taste the kal-guksu,

387
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,605
-you might change your mind.
-No, it--

388
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:26,939
-You might be disappointed.
-No.

389
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:30,309
No matter what kind
of kal-guksu comes out,

390
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:31,877
-this place is still great.
-It's good?

391
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:32,945
-Really?
-Yes.

392
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:36,048
I don't care if the noodles are
dry or undercooked.

393
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,116
Is that so?

394
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,951
Kal-guksu isn’t their main dish.

395
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:41,988
There are better
kal-guksu places than here.

396
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:43,956
Kal-guksu isn't the star of the show.

397
00:18:46,788 --> 00:18:49,362
KAL-GUKSU
11,000 WON, 1,100 YEN

398
00:18:49,657 --> 00:18:52,698
CAN SPLIT
A SINGLE SERVING INTO TWO BOWLS

399
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,569
So this is Hanseong Kal-guksu's kal-guksu.

400
00:19:19,917 --> 00:19:21,581
SCRATCH

401
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,299
This is delicious.

402
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:28,567
-I'm glad.
-Yes.

403
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,307
This kal-guksu is amazing.

404
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:37,443
It's so delicious.

405
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,746
I lowered the bar
way more than I should've

406
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,849
and wasn’t expecting anything,
so the gap really caught me off guard.

407
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,117
-Was this your plan?
-Plan?

408
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,919
No, that's what everyone says.

409
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:50,556
When wheat flour

410
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:52,925
was first introduced
during the Joseon Dynasty,

411
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:55,528
it was considered a luxury ingredient.

412
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:58,597
But now, it’s become
a staple for everyday people.

413
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,667
And is this bell pepper?

414
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:04,303
-Zucchini. Yes.
-Oh, it's zucchini.

415
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,540
Koreans really know
how to use zucchini well.

416
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,511
The idea of using zucchini
as a topping in noodle soup

417
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:13,579
doesn’t exist in Japan.

418
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:22,755
The broth is delicious.

419
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:26,158
I'm glad.

420
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:39,171
It's amazing.

421
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:45,878
It's delicious.

422
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:50,616
Japanese people tend
to think of fish or seaweed

423
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:51,984
when it comes to

424
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,386
-udon broth.
-Japan has a lot of seafood.

425
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,255
This feels like a meat-based broth.

426
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,023
-It's beef broth.
-Yes.

427
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,293
-That’s how deep the aroma and taste…
-Yes.

428
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,796
…of the broth are.

429
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:06,198
-It warms you up, right?
-Very much so.

430
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:07,733
-I'm glad.
-I love it.

431
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:09,368
But if you come to Korea again,

432
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:11,670
-there are a lot of…
-Yes.

433
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,073
…delicious kal-guksu restaurants.

434
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:17,209
There's clam kal-guksu

435
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:19,445
and jang kal-guksu,

436
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:21,814
which is made with gochujang.

437
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:22,748
HA…

438
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,416
Chicken kal-guksu is also good.

439
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:27,987
Some versions of kal-guksu
have noodles made with mugwort.

440
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:32,124
Others use a milky-white bone broth,
like seolleongtang.

441
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:33,726
This is insane.

442
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,930
-It makes you say that, right?
-It's insane. Yes.

443
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:38,998
-It's amazing.
-It is.

444
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:42,034
-Kal-guksu makes the meal complete.
-I'm glad.

445
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:45,271
I'd like to bring my grandkids here.

446
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:49,408
-Really? I'm so glad.
-I would like my grandkids

447
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,343
to taste the pancakes.

448
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,346
I'd also like to bring my friends
and wife from Japan.

449
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:55,748
Amazing.

450
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:02,354
Please don't.

451
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:03,989
NEXT INSANELY GOOD SPOT

452
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,827
GOPCHANG

00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:09,595
