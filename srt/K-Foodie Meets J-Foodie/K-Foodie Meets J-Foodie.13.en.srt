1
00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:04,505
K-foodie meets J-foodie.

2
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:06,073
This is insane.

3
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,443
This is today's gopchang restaurant.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,410
WOOJEONG TRIPE &amp; GOPCHANG

5
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:12,880
THIS PLACE IS PACKED EVEN LATE AT NIGHT

6
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,882
AN INSANELY GOOD GOPCHANG SPOT

7
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:17,684
This place is really popular.

8
00:00:23,953 --> 00:00:27,194
EPISODE 13
THE LUXURY BRAND OF GOPCHANG

9
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:28,829
-This place has beef gopchang?
-Yes.

10
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:30,931
-Beef gopchang?
-Would you like to try?

11
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:34,301
Sure. I don't think

12
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,703
I've had gopchang before.

13
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,672
People in Japan don’t really eat gopchang.

14
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:41,074
-I wonder why.
-Let's go in and talk.

15
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,476
-Let's do that.
-Okay.

16
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,745
MR. MATJJIGAE'S FIRST BEEF GOPCHANG

17
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:46,113
Excuse me.

18
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,681
-Hello.
-Hello.

19
00:00:48,052 --> 00:00:49,316
-Should we sit here?
-Yes.

20
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,684
Excuse me.

21
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:55,856
Somehow,
I thought gopchang places would be

22
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:58,158
all smoky and greasy,

23
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,515
but this is totally different.

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,396
-So tell me what we're having today.
-Well…

25
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,398
Here, you have to order
the assorted combo.

26
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,466
ASSORTED COMBO
GOPCHANG, DAECHANG, MAKCHANG, HEART

27
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:07,701
MEDIUM 86,000
LARGE 106,000

28
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:11,939
-The assorted combo at the top.
-Yes.

29
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,508
We'll have the assorted combo.

30
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:16,510
I can't stop drooling.

31
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:17,744
It's hideous.

32
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,447
-The problem is…
-There's a problem.

33
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:21,782
Grilled gopchang

34
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:23,383
isn't a side dish.

35
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:27,187
-We don't eat it with rice.
-Is that so?

36
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:32,125
-So without Coke or something to drink…
-So you want to have a drink?

37
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:35,462
-Should we have non-alcoholic beer?
-I'll have the regular one.

38
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:36,797
Then we'll both have beer.

39
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:39,066
I'll have a bottle of beer.

40
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:41,935
-Here is your beer.
-Thank you.

41
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:43,470
Oh, this one.

42
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:47,975
-Thank you.
-Here you go.

43
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,209
-Thank you.
-Sure.

44
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:53,680
-Good work.
-Good work.

45
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:54,982
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

46
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:04,524
Do you remember
how to say "cheers" in Korean?

47
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:07,794
-I knew it.
-Yes.

48
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:12,199
I'm slowly forgetting
everything I learned. What?

49
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:15,535
What was it?

50
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,406
Jjan.

51
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,408
-Jjan.
-Jjan.

52
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,476
-Right.
-Jjan.

53
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:23,577
Okay.

54
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,116
Delicious.

55
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,884
-Here's your cheonyeop.
-Yes, this is…

56
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,953
-Cheonyeop.
-Cheonyeop.

57
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,322
This can only be eaten when it's fresh.

58
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:38,225
CHEONYEOP, BASIC SIDE DISH

59
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,760
-Thank you for the food.
-Enjoy.

60
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,228
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

61
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,632
-Is this sesame oil with salt and pepper?
-Yes.

62
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,506
It's delicious.

63
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,375
It has a nice texture.

64
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,484
I think they use good sesame oil.

65
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:05,952
It smells good.

66
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:07,220
This is green onion kimchi.

67
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,722
-Green onion kimchi.
-Yes.

68
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:09,890
-These are chives…
-Chives.

69
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:10,924
-Chive kimchi.
-Yes.

70
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,360
They don't have regular cabbage kimchi?

71
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:14,394
They don't.

72
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:16,496
Why don't they have cabbage kimchi?

73
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:19,299
The cabbage kimchi doesn't really go well
with our dishes.

74
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,335
Shall I try the green onion kimchi?

75
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,439
-Green onion kimchi.
-Yes.

76
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,475
That's chive kimchi.

77
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,653
-It's here.
-It's here.

78
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:42,322
-Here's your assorted combo, medium size.
-Thank you.

79
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,724
Wow, it smells good.

80
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:49,896
ASSORTED COMBO, MEDIUM
86,000 WON, 8,600 YEN

81
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,065
I've never seen intestines like that.

82
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:53,834
I thought they were sausages.

83
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:58,405
-Is this gopchang?
-Yes, the small intestine.

84
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:03,410
This is daechang, horumon in Japanese.

85
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,380
-Heart.
-Heart.

86
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:08,849
This is makchang, the stomach.

87
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:15,388
This is called "gop."

88
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:19,126
If it's not fresh, it smells.

89
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,197
When it comes to beef gopchang,
the gop is everything.

90
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:29,636
Japanese people probably haven’t tried
gopchang with gop inside.

91
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:34,708
-Just try it with salt at first.
-Salt.

92
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,843
-Which one is salt?
-The one with the oil.

93
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,145
Oh, this.

94
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,761
The insides are quite different
from what I imagined.

95
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:57,330
I thought it would be greasy,

96
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,000
-but it's actually creamy.
-Right.

97
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,802
It's like liver paste.

98
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,038
It's like foie gras.

99
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,642
That makes sense.

100
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,211
I've never had gopchang before.

101
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,046
Really? Then that's great.

102
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,915
If you don’t eat gopchang quickly,

103
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,584
the tasty stuff inside will spill out.

104
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,428
This is an interesting dish.

105
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,032
-It's nutty, isn't it?
-Yes.

106
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,809
-Can I try the makchang too?
-Yes.

107
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,813
This is makchang sauce.

108
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,191
The makchang is good.

109
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:03,129
-It tastes familiar.
-Yes.

110
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,965
-It's makchang.
-Makchang.

111
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:18,511
This is daechang, or horumon in Japanese.

112
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:34,160
You might feel a bit guilty
when you eat daechang, but it's delicious.

113
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,095
Yes.

114
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:38,765
Which one do you like the best?

115
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:43,837
GOPCHANG, MAKCHANG, DAECHANG

116
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:45,772
-Can I be honest?
-Of course.

117
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,841
-This one.
-Makchang.

118
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:48,942
Makchang.

119
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,277
MR. MATJJIGAE'S CHOICE, MAKCHANG

120
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:52,946
I've had makchang before.

121
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:56,116
But gopchang

122
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,551
isn't a side dish.

123
00:06:58,618 --> 00:06:59,586
Exactly.

124
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:03,023
It seems like a dish
that alcohol lovers would really enjoy.

125
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,624
Right.

126
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,192
You need to have soju with gopchang.

127
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,395
You get tired of gopchang
if you keep eating it,

128
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,164
so you cleanse your palate with soju.

129
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:14,701
Then when it feels greasy again,
you wash it down with more soju.

130
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,636
-It’s a vicious cycle.
-A vicious cycle.

131
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,204
-I think I get it.
-Yes.

132
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:19,406
I can't take it anymore.

133
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:22,008
-Can I order soju?
-Sure.

134
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:23,843
One bottle of soju, please.

135
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:27,580
I'm having such a hard time right now.

136
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,950
It feels like I'm taking a bath
with my clothes on.

137
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,187
It's warm, but it feels unsettling.

138
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:37,424
-You want to wash it down with soju.
-It feels weird

139
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,192
without soju.

140
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,695
The flavor feels incomplete.

141
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,433
-Thank you.
-Sure.

142
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:47,801
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

143
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:49,769
Just a little bit.

144
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:51,404
-Thank you.
-Sure.

145
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,207
-Jjan.
-Jjan.

146
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,253
It does go well with it.

147
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,657
There's a famous comedian

148
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,792
-named Shin Dong-yup.
-Yes.

149
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:16,029
He would hold these like this and say,
"Si-kyung,

150
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,298
this is fat and this is alcohol."

151
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,800
"This must be really bad for you."

152
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:24,504
"But why is it so good?"

153
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:27,741
So I think God is…

154
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,043
-Perverse?
-Yes, perverse.

155
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,446
Why does everything
that's bad for you taste so good?

156
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:37,217
I haven't really gained much weight
in my life.

157
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,988
Have you ever gained weight,
Mr. Matjjigae?

158
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,191
Not really, no.

159
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,593
-You don't gain weight easily?
-No.

160
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:50,296
When I was young and wanted to become
a sumo wrestler, I couldn’t gain weight.

161
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,465
I guess I just don't gain weight easily.

162
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,601
What about you? Do you gain weight?

163
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,669
I gain weight just by breathing in air.

164
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,671
-By breathing in air?
-Yes.

165
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,107
So why did you want to become
a sumo wrestler?

166
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,412
I think I was in elementary
or middle school.

167
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,382
Haven't you ever admired
a professional athlete?

168
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:15,221
Back in my day,
baseball was at its peak,

169
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:19,059
so everyone was playing baseball,
which made me hate baseball.

170
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,493
I see.

171
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,496
Baseball rules are complicated

172
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,964
and you need several people to play.

173
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,902
Sumo had simple rules,
so that's why I was into it.

174
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,336
I thought it was cool.

175
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,384
Why is he putting bread in there?

176
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,653
Last time at the pork rib restaurant,

177
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:50,590
you said you felt bad for the radish.

178
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:54,060
It's the same here.
They use bread to absorb the oil.

179
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,029
Wow.

180
00:09:57,564 --> 00:10:00,033
-Bread to absorb the oil?
-Yes.

181
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,769
I wonder if anyone likes that wet bread.

182
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,604
Some people actually do eat it.

183
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,539
-Right?
-They get drunk

184
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,676
and be like, "What's this? It looks good."

185
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,145
-It does look good.
-The oil…

186
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:14,280
But I don't recommend it.

187
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:18,017
-Oh, poor bread.
-Poor bread.

188
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:23,790
But Koreans stir-fry rice
in the oil, and it's really good.

189
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,494
Could we also get
a serving of stir-fried rice?

190
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,631
TRIPE WITH NUTTY BEEF FAT

191
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:40,974
-It's here.
-It's here.

192
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,208
It's here, it's here.

193
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,546
This is stir-fried rice made with tripe.

194
00:10:47,275 --> 00:10:50,617
STIR-FRIED RICE WITH TRIPE
20,000 WON, 2,000 YEN

195
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:53,353
Why use just tripe
to make stir-fried rice?

196
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,121
If you try it,

197
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:59,225
you'll see that the texture
is actually really good.

198
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:02,295
I'll try it, then.

199
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,237
The tripe just jumped into my mouth.

200
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:15,041
The size is perfect.

201
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:15,975
TRIPE

202
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,778
-I see why people like it so much.
-That's good.

203
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,180
The spiciness is perfect.

204
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,384
It uses deeply fermented kimchi,

205
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,153
-so it's quite sour, right?
-Yes.

206
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:33,493
This is something every Korean would love.

207
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,629
Most people might like this.

208
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,269
-It's…
-The problem is…

209
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,173
that this is a great snack for drinking.

210
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:50,243
-Is that so?
-People have soju with this too.

211
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,785
Can I have some beer?

212
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,054
I got it.

213
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:06,125
Oh, did that upset you?

214
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,293
-Very much.
-Really?

215
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:11,034
I've never liked it
when others poured my drink for me.

216
00:12:11,109 --> 00:12:12,065
-Really?
-Yes.

217
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:15,301
I'd be like, "Don't. I'll do it.
I'll drink at my own pace."

218
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,904
I'm not good at pouring drinks.

219
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:20,106
I don't know how to pour them.

220
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,909
That's a really big difference
between Japan and Korea.

221
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,944
We keep wanting to do something for them,

222
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:28,214
but for them, it's…
That can be a burden, right?

223
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:29,816
It could be pressure for both sides.

224
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,118
He's not even listening.

225
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:33,987
-What?
-Nothing.

226
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,456
-Did something happen?
-No.

227
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,758
From the perspective
of someone who doesn't drink,

228
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:44,030
drinking etiquette is complicated,
so we just make the others drink quickly

229
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:46,766
and say, "Get drunk."

230
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,202
You can really hold your liquor.

231
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,842
Surface tension drink.

232
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:04,183
I wouldn't say there's
just one correct way to drink,

233
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,385
but in Korea,

234
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,854
people usually fill about
70 percent of the glass for you.

235
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,491
-Really?
-Koreans usually do a shot,

236
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:14,594
so if the glass is filled to the brim,
drinking it all in one go

237
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:15,795
can be a lot of pressure.

238
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:18,798
-So 70 percent is ideal.
-Yes.

239
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,735
Seventy percent. Seventy percent.

240
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:24,304
Oh, that's perfect.

241
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,040
You're a quick learner.

242
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:30,610
-We fill up the glass in Japan.
-Yes.

243
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,112
-We go, "More, more."
-"More."

244
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,017
-We often have conversations like that.
-I see.

245
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,120
-Jjan.
-Jjan.

246
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:51,798
It's impressive how we went from
gopchang to stir-fried rice.

247
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,900
After holding it in for a while

248
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,536
and you start to think,
"Ah, I want to eat rice,"

249
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,671
it just appears.

250
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,908
So, there's no smooth breaking ball.

251
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,744
It feels like moving from
one river to another.

252
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,046
Now, a more intense dish will come out.

253
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:10,717
Can we also get a stew, please?

254
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,619
It's not on the menu yet,

255
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:17,190
but they made it just for me a few times.

256
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,958
It's really good.

257
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:21,094
-So it's like an ura menu.
-Yes.

258
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,203
One more bottle, please.

259
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,805
-It's here.
-It's here.

260
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,574
This is gopchang stew.

261
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:37,510
GOPCHANG STEW
NOT ON THE MENU YET

262
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:40,680
You have to let it simmer
for 15 to 20 minutes

263
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:43,149
so the vegetables and the broth

264
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,384
can come together.

265
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,354
LET THE VEGETABLE FLAVOR THE BROTH

266
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,693
-Is it done?
-Yes.

267
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,661
-Thank you.
-Sure.

268
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,545
-The broth is good.
-I'm glad.

269
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:13,679
It's very flavorful.

270
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,982
-Where did all the gop…
-Yes?

271
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,217
…in the gopchang go?

272
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,619
It's all in the broth.

273
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,320
-It's in the broth?
-Yes.

274
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:24,190
It goes in the broth,
making the stew that much better.

275
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,525
Oh, I see.

276
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:28,161
So it doesn't stay inside.

277
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:29,295
That's right.

278
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,204
This is good.

279
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:39,372
-Really?
-Yes.

280
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:42,708
The sweetness
of boiled gopchang is charming.

281
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,211
The gopchang stew is good.

282
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:46,446
-Really?
-Yes.

283
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,015
It's similar to motsuni, braised tripe,

284
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,451
so it's a flavor I'm familiar with,

285
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,352
and it's also familiar to Japanese people.

286
00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:58,724
It's good.

287
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:00,793
The udon is good too.

288
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,628
-Really?
-Yes.

289
00:16:03,656 --> 00:16:07,066
A person from the birthplace of udon said,
"The udon is delicious."

290
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,935
Come on. Birthplace, my foot.

291
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:12,872
-It's good.
-The broth… I can't stop eating it.

292
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,479
The gop is in the broth…

293
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:20,246
If you dip
the stir-fried rice in the broth,

294
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,148
you'll get fat.

295
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:30,690
It's insane.

296
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,026
It's insane.

297
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,733
-This is bone broth.
-Yes.

298
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:45,238
-Is it makgeolli?
-It's not makgeolli.

299
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,039
It's additional broth.

300
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,008
People might think it's makgeolli.

301
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:50,710
It's not.

302
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,079
If it comes out at this timing,
a Japanese person

303
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:54,847
would probably think,
"Oh, it's makgeolli."

304
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,216
Should we add the broth?

305
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,952
ADDING MAKGEOLLI(?) BROTH

306
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,025
There we go.

307
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:02,400
The broth became a bit lighter.

308
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,391
I think making it lighter is better.

309
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,773
Can we have a bowl of rice, please?

310
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:23,676
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

311
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:26,012
-A bit…
-Rice?

312
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,813
Yes, it goes really well with the broth.

313
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,115
Rice, please.

314
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:35,388
You dip it in the broth.

315
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:45,231
This is insane.

316
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:53,873
It's insane.

317
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,382
It goes well with rice,
but it is spicy for sure.

318
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,485
This is gopchang stew.

319
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:07,587
But the problem is…

320
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:11,457
It's another problem.
It also goes well with alcohol.

321
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:12,658
Is that so?

322
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:23,502
-Do you enjoy gatherings…
-Yes.

323
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:24,537
…with dinner and drinks?

324
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:26,739
-I do.
-You do?

325
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:30,676
-Yes.
-So you stay until the end?

326
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:31,844
Of course.

327
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:34,780
-Until the end?
-I don't back out in the middle.

328
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,115
I back out in the middle.

329
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,017
I always back out.

330
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:40,486
That's upsetting.

331
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:44,056
-Jjan.
-Jjan.

332
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,500
The udon is good.

333
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:56,823
SIP

334
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,005
Oh, right.

335
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,406
I'm sorry.

336
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,141
I find this really troublesome.

337
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,045
Fill it up to 70 percent.

338
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,514
-Jjan.
-Jjan.

339
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,375
It's a bit spicy. I'm thirsty.

340
00:19:15,491 --> 00:19:16,342
SIP

341
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,458
-Hold on.
-I'm sorry.

342
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,661
If you pick up your pace,

343
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,597
you'll get drunk.
That's going to be annoying.

344
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,000
Now…

345
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:30,803
He's starting to fill it up past 70%.
It's getting troublesome for him.

346
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,171
Get drunk.

347
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:33,439
NEXT INSANELY GOOD SPOT

348
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,840
THE RECONNAISSANCE IS OVER

349
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,308
THE REAL TASTE EXCHANGE BEGINS NOW

350
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,778
-Today's a competition.
-Come on.

351
