1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,473
JJAJANGMYEON, YAKISOBA

2
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:10,644
K-foodie meets J-foodie.

3
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:12,779
This is insane.

4
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:21,021
It feels like a busy downtown area.

5
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:22,823
This place is called Jongno.

6
00:00:24,053 --> 00:00:25,993
JONGNO, THE HEART OF SEOUL

7
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:29,581
WHERE TRADITION MEETS MODERNITY

8
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:32,866
This is nice.

9
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:33,867
-Charming, right?
-It's…

10
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:35,569
-It’s a vibey street with real depth.
-Yes.

11
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,173
This is a seolleongtang restaurant.

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,341
-Seolleongtang?
-Yes.

13
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,444
-Thirty years of tradition.
-Right.

14
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:48,982
-Actually, I used to study for…
-Yes.

15
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,819
…my baking certification
at an academy in this very building.

16
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:53,887
I see.

17
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:56,290
There are a lot of great places
to eat around here,

18
00:00:56,356 --> 00:01:01,328
so I’m planning to take you to one
I discovered back then.

19
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:08,368
So even in winter, people still gather
and drink at street stalls like this.

20
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,037
You can eat inside.

21
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:12,573
-Yes.
-It’s just like the food stalls in Hakata.

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,908
-It has a nice vibe.
-Yes.

23
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:16,677
-Is that takoyaki?
-It's hotteok.

24
00:01:18,874 --> 00:01:19,746
Hotteok?

25
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:21,915
-Yes.
-Hotteok and takoyaki.

26
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:24,184
-These are tteokbokki and fish cakes.
-Tteokbokki and…

27
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,687
And fritters.

28
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:29,756
So they can take it to go.

29
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,291
-Hello.
-Hello.

30
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:32,392
Hello.

31
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,261
Wait. What?

32
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,463
She's my teacher.

33
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,066
-Your baking academy teacher?
-Yes.

34
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,400
From the academy here?

35
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,036
Did you come here on purpose
just to be on TV?

36
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,138
Really? I'm going to be on TV?

37
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:46,907
Si-kyung really owes you one.

38
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:48,942
He said, "Thank you
for treating Si-kyung well."

39
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,444
Does Si-kyung have talent in baking?

40
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,279
He's asking if I have talent in baking.

41
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:54,014
-He's the best.
-Really?

42
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:56,316
He's never baked anything for me before.

43
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:58,652
-I'll bake something for you someday.
-Right?

44
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,888
You invited me over to your place,
but you didn't give me any cake.

45
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,557
-I'm sorry.
-Yes.

46
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,559
-Thanks.
-Can you recommend a restaurant?

47
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,194
Any restaurant recommendations?

48
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,930
-You know them all.
-She said I'll know.

49
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:11,698
-We went to a lot of restaurants.
-We went

50
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:13,200
-to restaurants…
-You went frequently.

51
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,534
-…often.
-Really?

52
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,436
I'll visit your shop later
to have a financier.

53
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,405
-We'll visit your shop for a financier.
-Okay.

54
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:19,442
-Bye.
-Bye.

55
00:02:19,492 --> 00:02:20,461
KOREAN FRIEND +1

56
00:02:20,527 --> 00:02:22,442
Your teacher came.

57
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,245
It's that kind of town.

58
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:28,582
-It's a place you used to go to…
-Yes.

59
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:31,918
-When I was taking baking classes.
-What are we having today?

60
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,255
It may not be the best Chinese restaurant,

61
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:40,560
but they serve classic
old-school jjajangmyeon

62
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:44,031
-and the tangsuyuk’s pretty good too.
-By "old-school,"

63
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:46,566
do you mean the flavor has changed?

64
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,435
It's gotten fancier

65
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,603
-in many ways.
-I see.

66
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,705
-Simple is best.
-Yes. We're here.

67
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:52,873
-It's here.
-Yes.

68
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,808
-How do you read this in Japanese?
-Seikoso?

69
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,309
-Saikoso.
-Saikoso?

70
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:57,277
Yes.

71
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,179
THE ESSENCE OF
KOREAN-STYLE CHINESE CUISINE

72
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:00,981
WITH 60 YEARS OF TRADITION

73
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:04,618
I wanted to introduce a place
that serves old-school jjajangmyeon.

74
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,187
AN OLD-SCHOOL JJAJANGMYEON PLACE
THAT BRINGS BACK MEMORIES

75
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,856
AN INSANELY GOOD SPOT IN JONGNO,
SEOHOJANG

76
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:13,156
When it comes to Korean-Chinese food,
jjajangmyeon’s the classic, right?

77
00:03:13,263 --> 00:03:14,388
EPISODE 18

78
00:03:14,456 --> 00:03:15,991
SIX DECADES OF TRADITION AND TASTE:
KOREAN-STYLE CHINESE CUISINE

79
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,332
Hello. It's tangsuyuk.

80
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:23,036
This place looks like
it’s been around for a long time.

81
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:25,772
They say it’s been here
for about 60 years.

82
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,044
-Sixty years.
-Korea has a long history, too.

83
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:33,080
Such restaurants are run mostly
by Chinese people.

84
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,383
-Let me explain.
-Okay.

85
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,350
So…

86
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:40,020
MEALS, ENTRÉES, ALCOHOL

87
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:43,390
-What’s that in the top left corner?
-It's called japtangbap.

88
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:46,960
It’s like a thick seafood rice bowl.

89
00:03:47,022 --> 00:03:47,928
JAPTANGBAP

90
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,930
-You know palbochae, right?
-I do.

91
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:53,567
It's like palbochae with rice.

92
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:58,171
There's shrimp fried rice, jjamppong,
white jjamppong…

93
00:03:58,805 --> 00:03:59,973
-I have a question.
-Yes?

94
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,112
Korean jjamppong is very different
from the Japanese one, right?

95
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:08,482
Yes. Basic Korean jjamppong is red.

96
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:12,119
In Japan, Chinese restaurants
don’t usually serve jjamppong.

97
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,154
-It's only in Nagasaki?
-Yes, only in Nagasaki.

98
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:18,258
If you order jjamppong
at a Chinese restaurant,

99
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:21,128
they'll tell you to go to
a jjamppong restaurant.

100
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:23,717
-I see.
-Yes.

101
00:04:23,792 --> 00:04:26,633
-And fried dumplings and boiled dumplings.
-They also have fried dumplings.

102
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,436
-They also have fried dumplings?
-Yes, but it's not homemade.

103
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:30,871
-It's not?
-No.

104
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:31,884
Then I won't order them.

105
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,542
They're still pretty good
even if they are not homemade.

106
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,711
In Japan, they're always
expected to be handmade.

107
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,046
-It's a lot of work.
-It is.

108
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,083
I worked part-time

109
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,618
-at a Chinese restaurant before.
-Yes.

110
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:49,089
I think
that’s something worth sticking to.

111
00:04:49,518 --> 00:04:51,258
GOURMET

112
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,827
-Then there's a list of entrées.
-Yes.

113
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:57,130
-Wait, then what's the previous list?
-Meals.

114
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:59,266
MEALS

115
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,035
Meals and entrées are different?

116
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:05,105
Usually, you start with an entrée

117
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:09,242
and finish with a meal like,
“What do you want to wrap up with?”

118
00:05:09,738 --> 00:05:12,512
ENTRÉE FIRST, THEN MEAL

119
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,915
Everything in this list has rice.

120
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,983
-It's like I'm giving a lecture.
-It's a lecture.

121
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,085
Chinese food lecture.

122
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,175
CHINESE FOOD HITS DIFFERENT
WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND IT!

123
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,910
EXPLORING THE LINE BETWEEN
MEALS AND ENTRÉES

124
00:05:22,985 --> 00:05:24,090
INTRODUCTION TO CHINESE FOOD

125
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,893
Bap, bap, bap.

126
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,995
-Jjamppong has noodles.
-What is bap?

127
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,997
-Bap means rice.
-So it's something rice.

128
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,600
They put it on top of the rice.

129
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,769
That's why they are meals.
Entrées don't have rice.

130
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,137
Okay.

131
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:39,005
-And palbochae.
-Palbochae.

132
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:42,809
Yuringi is crispy fried chicken served

133
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:43,743
over cabbage…

134
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,845
GROWL

135
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:47,013
-…with a chilled sweet and tangy sauce.
-Okay.

136
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,181
And kkanpunggi is…

137
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:49,149
GROWL

138
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:50,851
-…a stir-fried dish without broth.
-Yes.

139
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,553
-Sweet and spicy chicken…
-Okay.

140
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,090
-Okay. I understood everything.
-That's all.

141
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,259
-What should we order?
-What?

142
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:00,994
-What should we order?
-You haven't decided?

143
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,495
I haven't.

144
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,265
-Then for entrées…
-Yes.

145
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:06,867
…I'd definitely recommend tangsuyuk.

146
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,168
-Let's have tangsuyuk.
-Okay.

147
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:11,171
Then tangsuyuk, and if there’s
anything else you want to try,

148
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:14,207
-go ahead and order that too.
-Let's get a recommended dish.

149
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:16,276
-Shall we go with palbochae?
-Yes. Palbochae.

150
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:17,477
Then palbochae and…

151
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,847
We'll have palbochae and tangsuyuk.

152
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:26,319
-And dumplings that are not homemade.
-What?

153
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:30,190
PART ONE
ENTRÉES

154
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:32,359
-Hello.
-Hello.

155
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,460
The basic setup is ready.

156
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:34,895
-Dakuang?
-Yes.

157
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,363
-Dakuang?
-Yes.

158
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,797
-Is this dakuang?
-Pardon?

159
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:38,832
-Dakuang?
-Dakuang.

160
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,167
-Dakwa?
-Dakuang?

161
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,403
-Is this dakuang?
-Are you Korean?

162
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,738
-No.
-She's Chinese.

163
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,907
-Oh, you're Chinese?
-Yes.

164
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,377
-It's danmuji in Korean.
-Right.

165
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,513
Why are they serving this as a side dish?

166
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,616
At a Chinese restaurant in Japan,
if it came out like this,

167
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:59,419
-you'd be like, “What is this?”
-Right.

168
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:02,656
It’s no exaggeration to say there isn’t

169
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:05,191
a single Chinese restaurant
in Korea without pickled radish.

170
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,127
This is a must when having jjajangmyeon.

171
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,095
-Really?
-It's basic.

172
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,098
I’m picky about pickled radish.

173
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,634
GOURMET

174
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,703
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

175
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,913
-So what did you do this afternoon?
-Today, I was tired

176
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,283
so I took a nap.

177
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:33,887
Hold on.

178
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,922
-What did you just pour on the radish?
-Vinegar…

179
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,193
-I was like, "What the hell is he doing?"
-I'm sorry.

180
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,063
-Japanese people would never do that.
-Koreans do.

181
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,267
-I'm sorry.
-Why would you pour vinegar on it?

182
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:50,103
Some places keep
their pickled radish fresh,

183
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,940
but others don’t. If it’s a bit dry

184
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:58,345
or not great, adding vinegar
brings back a similar taste.

185
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,348
-Why are you laughing?
-I've never seen someone

186
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,216
add vinegar to pickled radish.

187
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,520
-You guys add it too, right?
-Out of habit.

188
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:10,023
-It's a habit.
-What?

189
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,058
We all add vinegar, right?

190
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,560
-We do.
-We all add vinegar.

191
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:14,661
We all add vinegar.

192
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,763
The difference between

193
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,798
-Korea and Japan is striking.
-Still…

194
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:21,601
It's here.

195
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,303
This is palbochae.

196
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,406
PALBOCHAE
30,000 WON, 3,000 YEN

197
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:30,043
PALBOCHAE: A STIR-FRIED DISH
OF SEAFOOD AND EIGHT KINDS OF VEGETABLES

198
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,845
KNOWN FOR ITS SPICY AND THICK SAUCE

199
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,414
-Here are your fried dumplings.
-This is…

200
00:08:34,476 --> 00:08:36,049
FRIED DUMPLINGS
8,000 WON, 800 YEN

201
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:39,152
KOREAN-STYLE FRIED DUMPLINGS STUFFED
WITH MINCED MEAT AND VEGETABLES

202
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,054
-This is tangsuyuk.
-Yes.

203
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,923
TANGSUYUK
23,000 WON, 2,300 YEN

204
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,360
TANGSUYUK: CRISPY ON THE OUTSIDE,
TENDER ON THE INSIDE, OLD-SCHOOL STYLE

205
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:49,462
A PERFECT COMBO
OF SWEET SAUCE AND CRISPY BATTER

206
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,665
So they add the sauce later.

207
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,734
Yes, that's actually a whole debate.

208
00:08:54,801 --> 00:09:00,173
Originally, tangsuyuk was served hot
straight from the kitchen,

209
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,143
-already mixed with the sauce.
-Yes, it's like that in Japan.

210
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:07,113
-But if it's delivered like that…
-It gets soggy.

211
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:12,052
So they started to deliver
the sauce separately.

212
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,521
Now people are split into two,
those who dip the sauce…

213
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:15,755
DIPPER

214
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:18,591
…and those who pour it on top.

215
00:09:18,653 --> 00:09:19,793
POURER

216
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,162
-So some people like to dip.
-Yes.

217
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,964
-People debate over that.
-They debate.

218
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,833
But like I always say,

219
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,402
to me, real tangsuyuk

220
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:32,138
is the kind that comes

221
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:33,573
already mixed with the sauce.

222
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,541
POURER

223
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:37,343
And this sauce is very sweet.

224
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,279
-So… Yes.
-It's sweet?

225
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,281
-The tangsuyuk is sweet?
-Yes.

226
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:42,715
My heart is racing.

227
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:49,355
-So what's your choice?
-So I can also dip it?

228
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,825
-You can just dip it like this.
-Dip.

229
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:56,696
-Like this.
-I never had

230
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,299
tangsuyuk like this before.

231
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,034
-Try it.
-I'll try it like that.

232
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,871
-This sauce is sweet?
-It is.

233
00:10:12,107 --> 00:10:15,348
FIRST DIPPING IN HIS LIFE

234
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,083
How is it?

235
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,286
It's sweet.

236
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,821
-It's sweet, right?
-It is.

237
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,559
It's good. Their tangsuyuk is good.

238
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,328
Do you want to try pouring?
Maybe just half?

239
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,597
-Sure. Shall we pour it?
-Go ahead.

240
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,068
FROM DIPPING

241
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,471
TO POURING

242
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,718
-Is it okay?
-Yes.

243
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:58,491
I think this is just the right amount

244
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:00,260
-of sauce.
-Yes.

245
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,694
DIPPER, POURER

246
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,696
POURER

247
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:06,099
I like to add vinegar.

248
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,300
-To tangsuyuk?
-Yes.

249
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:11,538
The sauce is pretty sweet,

250
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,873
so it might get a bit overwhelming.

251
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:17,744
Subuta has a much stronger vinegar flavor.

252
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,580
Yes, Japanese tangsuyuk
is a bit more sour.

253
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,450
I think subuta is sour.

254
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,586
SUBUTA, JAPANESE TANGSUYUK

255
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:29,589
SU MEANS VINEGAR AND BUTA MEANS PORK,
PORK DISH WITH VINEGAR

256
00:11:30,051 --> 00:11:33,126
KOREAN, SWEET
JAPANESE, SOUR

257
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:37,697
There are places in Japan that also add
pineapple to their subuta sauce, right?

258
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:38,798
I like it.

259
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,833
-Do you like pineapples in sauces?
-I do.

260
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,869
-Me too.
-Right.

261
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:46,039
-What's that?
-Well…

262
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,608
In Korea, we add chili pepper powder
to vinegar and soy sauce.

263
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:51,611
-Want to try making it Korean-style?
-You dip the dumpling in it?

264
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:54,380
You can dip anything in it.

265
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,718
Vinegar soy sauce
with chili pepper powder.

266
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:10,063
That’s a nice twist to switch up
the flavor of tangsuyuk.

267
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,431
-Yes.
-Yes.

268
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,734
I'm glad you like it.

269
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,540
I like how the meat is fried

270
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,176
-and the size of the meat…
-Yes.

271
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:28,248
…but I think it would be better
if it had more vegetables.

272
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:31,884
The cut of meat used is different
from Japanese subuta too.

273
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,287
-Yes.
-When I went to Japan for the first time,

274
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,322
I really enjoyed subuta.

275
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:39,459
It felt kind of like the first time
I had Japanese tonkatsu.

276
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,694
Japanese-style tonkatsu

277
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,097
-has the fat nicely attached.
-Yes.

278
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:48,601
In Korea, fatty cuts aren’t commonly used.

279
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:49,836
-In dishes like this?
-Yes.

280
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,905
-So it’s mostly lean meat.
-Yes.

281
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:56,276
-It seems like a cultural difference.
-Yes.

282
00:12:56,504 --> 00:12:57,443
PALBOCHAE

283
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,579
This is completely different
from Japan too.

284
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,849
-Shrimp?
-Shrimp and…

285
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,684
I already got some octopus.

286
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:06,686
-Squid.
-Yes.

287
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:08,655
This one has a nice texture.

288
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,800
It's completely different
from what I thought.

289
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:21,968
-Is that so?
-Yes.

290
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,638
It has an interesting flavor.

291
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:37,083
There’s a ton of seafood in this.

292
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,053
-And it's quite spicy.
-Yes.

293
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,058
Japanese palbochae isn't spicy at all.

294
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,327
Oh, it has a mild flavor.

295
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:51,030
I've never had palbochae like this before.

296
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,904
-The pal in palbochae means eight.
-Yes.

297
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:04,243
And in Japan, it usually means
the number of vegetables.

298
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,113
-It means eight treasures.
-It's the same in Korea.

299
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,882
The Japanese version has more vegetables.

300
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,584
-I see.
-Yes.

301
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,921
-This is a totally different dish.
-I see. It's different.

302
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,029
Should we try the fried dumplings?

303
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:26,799
But it's not pan-fried. It's deep-fried.

304
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,735
In Korea, it isn’t pan-fried.

305
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:32,271
For pan-fried dumplings, you cover the pan
and cook just one side,

306
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:35,641
so the bottom’s crispy while the top stays
soft and moist. That’s how they're made.

307
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,076
-Yes.
-But in Korea,

308
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:38,244
we deep-fry it.

309
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,980
KOREAN-STYLE DEEP-FRIED DUMPLINGS

310
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,181
I see.

311
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,622
It's a dumpling.

312
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:53,826
-It's a dumpling.
-Yes.

313
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,094
Yes. That's it.

314
00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:00,233
GOURMET

315
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,769
I'm getting

316
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,072
-really nervous.
-Why?

317
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,341
It seems like you don't like this place.

318
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,810
No, no. It's fun.

319
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:14,247
It’s a gourmet friend’s favorite spot,
so I’ve got to try a bit of everything.

320
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,849
-Your…
-What should I order?

321
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,518
There has to be something.

322
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:22,355
It feels like there will be
something that will make me say,

323
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,357
“I’ve never had this before,
but it’s good.”

324
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,759
I hope that's jjajangmyeon.

325
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:30,263
I brought you here
because I wanted to show you

326
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,831
what old-school jjajangmyeon is like.

327
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:37,670
These days, there are a lot
of trendy spots with things like

328
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:40,173
yuni jjajang, seafood jjajang,
or truffle jjajang,

329
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:43,676
but I wanted to show you
what old-school jjajangmyeon is like.

330
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:48,981
Have you been eating jjajangmyeon
since you were born?

331
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,716
Of course.

332
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,285
Everyone here is like that.

333
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,753
-Soul food?
-Yes.

334
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,689
What I still remember is that
every time we moved,

335
00:15:57,356 --> 00:16:00,092
-we’d eat jjajangmyeon.
-Why?

336
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,562
-You can't cook on moving day.
-Yes.

337
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:06,032
So you have to get delivery food.

338
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:10,169
You have to decide between
jjajangmyeon and jjamppong.

339
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:12,171
-Really?
-So when you're asked what you want,

340
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:15,775
that’s when it feels like
the most agonizing choice ever.

341
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:19,745
So that choice felt like…

342
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,014
-The ultimate…
-…the ultimate decision in life.

343
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,416
Now…

344
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,085
We have to decide on
the main menu for today.

345
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:29,121
Please decide on whether we should eat

346
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:31,390
jjajangmyeon or jjamppong.

347
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:34,994
JJAJANG OR JJAMPPONG…

348
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:38,064
I'll have jjajangmyeon.

349
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,334
-Then I'll have jjamppong.
-Jjajangmyeon.

350
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,538
I’m really looking forward
to the jjajangmyeon.

351
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:47,874
We'll have one jjajangmyeon
and one jjamppong.

352
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,442
PART TWO
MEALS

353
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:53,112
-There was a time when…
-Yes.

354
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,147
-…Korean-style jjajangmyeon made its way…
-Yes.

355
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:58,317
-…into Japan, but it never caught on.
-Really? I wonder why.

356
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:01,821
I was also curious. Why?

357
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,824
Maybe it was the taste or the look,

358
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:08,327
but among Japanese people,
it never got popular enough for

359
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,829
anyone to say, “I’m hooked on this,”

360
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:11,831
-and keep going back for more.
-I see.

361
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:15,535
I think it's the kind of food
that makes you think,

362
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,271
"How do I take this in?"

363
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,440
-Let's figure out that reason.
-Yes.

364
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,976
-Well, this is the home of jjajangmyeon.
-Yes.

365
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,712
The jjajangmyeon is here.

366
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,281
Here you go.

367
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,182
It looks so good.

368
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:33,119
JJAMPPONG
9,000 WON, 900 YEN

369
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:44,363
JJAMPPONG: A SPICY KOREAN-STYLE CHINESE
DISH MADE WITH SEAFOOD AND VEGETABLES.

370
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,769
JJAJANGMYEON
7,000 WON, 700 YEN

371
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,610
BASIC JJAJANGMYEON

372
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:01,480
A KOREAN-STYLE CHINESE DISH MADE BY
STIR-FRYING CHUNJANG, ONIONS, AND MEAT

373
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,783
So teach me how to eat this.

374
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,619
Just mix it well and eat.

375
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:11,290
-Mix it while saying, "Become delicious."
-Become delicious.

376
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,860
Become delicious.

377
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:19,031
Wow, it has a unique smell.

378
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,569
I can smell the sweet smell…

379
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,438
-Yes.
-…of stir-fried onions.

380
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,540
-The onion is the main ingredient.
-Yes.

381
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,008
Wait.

382
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:32,745
It's long.

383
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,686
-Thank you for the food.
-Enjoy.

384
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,725
I hope you like it.

385
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,244
It's good.

386
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,347
Out of everything we ate,
this is the best.

387
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:09,382
I'm glad.

388
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,284
Thank goodness.

389
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:17,757
The noodles are mixed simply
with the sauce and nothing else.

390
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:22,728
Once you get hooked, it feels like
something you could eat for life.

391
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:25,031
They can serve it like that
because they're confident.

392
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:28,300
That's why I chose this restaurant.

393
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:49,221
Even for a Korean,
this would definitely count

394
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:52,658
-as old-school jjajangmyeon, right?
-Yes.

395
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,360
-For sure.
-Right.

396
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:57,196
This is the simplest
and most classic version.

397
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:07,807
I don't know if it's okay to say this…

398
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:08,874
Yes?

399
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:15,014
But it’s like eating the most basic
yakisoba without any vegetables.

400
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:17,483
Right.

401
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,186
You don't need
any other ingredients for yakisoba.

402
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,488
Just the texture of the noodles

403
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:26,826
-with the sauce alone is enough.
-Yes.

404
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,496
When I walk past a street stall
and catch the smell of yakisoba,

405
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,098
my brain tells me to head that way.

406
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:37,236
For most Japanese people,
the yakisoba they had as kids

407
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:40,473
-sticks in their memory.
-Yes.

408
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,775
-They go like, "I want to have yakisoba."
-Yes.

409
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:45,678
It's very similar to what I had back then.

410
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,247
Yakisoba has a nostalgic taste,
and jjajangmyeon is the same.

411
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:53,152
We could probably spend five years
just covering Chinese restaurants.

412
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:56,622
Yes, just covering Japanese dumplings
will take five years.

413
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:57,990
Three years for subuta.

414
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:01,393
Then it'll take ten years
to cover jjajangmyeon.

415
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:06,766
Next time, we'll go to Sakai in Osaka,

416
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:08,667
and I'll take you to an okonomiyaki place

417
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:13,005
where the owner turns

418
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:16,642
everything into a masterpiece.
Not just the okonomiyaki,

419
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:21,547
the yakisoba there is just as amazing,
like this jjajangmyeon.

420
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,415
I want to go there.

421
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:27,319
When that man in Sakai
starts cooking a dish,

422
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:31,724
no matter how simple it is, it transforms
into something truly special.

423
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:34,593
MR. MATJJIGAE

424
00:21:35,022 --> 00:21:36,595
CHALLENGES

425
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,633
KOREAN JJAJANGMYEON HEAD-ON

00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:42,635
IN THE NEXT INSANELY GOOD SPOT

427
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:49,061
WHAT IS THE BEST YAKISOBA IN OSAKA?
