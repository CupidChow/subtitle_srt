it might be nice to try some

I’ve been wanting to come here

52
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,120
Mr. Matjjigae was adamant
about coming here.

53
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,788
He wanted to bring me here.

54
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:36,423

55
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,959

63
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:00,280
In Korea, sweet and salty

-These?

75
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:23,136
-Not the blowfish sashimi?
-No, you win the dolls.

76
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,604
I see.

77
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:25,972
-Do many people win?
-Shall we try?

78
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,341
-No, I'm good.
-Let's keep going then.

79
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,811
-We're both adults.
-Yes.

80
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,114
-Shall we keep walking?
-Yes, let's keep looking around.

You can start purchasing at 9:30.

82
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,452
Oh, they open at 9:30.

83
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,654
They're not open yet?

84
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,823
Not all the stores are open yet.

85
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:43,790
CURRENT TIME
9:10 A.M.

86
00:03:44,503 --> 00:03:46,593

87
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,396
THEY ARE GETTING READY FOR THE EVENT

88
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:50,630
Right now,

89
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:54,234
-let's just look around.
-Let’s see what they have.

90
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:56,336
It's going to be like a war.

91
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,505
-When it's time, people will swarm in.
-Yes.

92
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,841
I don't know how it will begin

93
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,677
and how many people will gather.

94
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:05,746
Mr. Matjjigae,

95
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,914
what is your favorite kind of sushi?

96
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,316
I like

00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:10,784

00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,858
The one with the crab sticks.

101
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,293
What about you?

102
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,329
There are so many that I can't choose.

103
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,564
-I like different types of…
-What do you eat first?

104
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,633
I start with white fish.

105
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,769
-I also like oily fish.
-Hello.

106
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,271

All the sushi…

110
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:39,713
This isn’t conveyor belt sushi.

111
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,782
-It’s display sushi.
-Yes.

112
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,651
You can pick and choose whatever you want.

113
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:47,954
-Want to try some?
-The sushi looks good.

114
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,257
But I've never seen
anything like this before.

115
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:51,458
Not conveyor belt sushi,

116
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,827

117
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:55,462

00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:21,254
-Right.
-I'm hungover right now.

128
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,889
Hungover…

129
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:25,292
-I thought I smelled alcohol on you.
-I'm sorry.

130
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,260
How much did you drink?

131
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,062

-Yes.
-Right.

147
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,056
You should've remembered.

148
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,258
I will memorize it.
You were pretty popular.

149
00:05:58,325 --> 00:05:59,960
I was popular back in the day.

150
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:00,994
-Now…
-You still are.

151
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:01,995
-Yes.
-No, not anymore.

152
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,931
-He's in a TV show.
-It’s just like the countryside in Korea.

153
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,867
Oh, you didn’t know?

154
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,802
Well, you oughta have known.

155
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,206
What should we do until 9:30?

156
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:14,374
-Wait in here.
-Go.

157
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,509
That's okay.
I'd actually like to look around.

158
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,278
-Then go and come back here later.
-Shall I?

159
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:19,846
-Then…
-We'll be back.

00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:24,918
-Matsushige.
-You forgot already.

163
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,753
You don't remember.

164
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,289
-Right?
-When I go to the countryside,

165
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:30,724
people go, "What was your name?"

166
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,592
-"You're famous, aren't you?"
-Right.

167
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,761
They make me introduce myself.

168
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:38,098
The fried octopus is 300 yen. I like that.

169
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,436
There are
so many different kinds of sushi.

170
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,439
They are different from

171
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,141
-the sushi we know.
-They are different.

172
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:51,077
-The size is different, too.
-Yes.

173
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,545
We did a lap.

174
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:53,580
We did.

175
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,584
Oh, they're open now.

176
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:58,518
-It has begun.
-Yes.

177
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,421
Where shall we go first?

178
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,123
We have to hurry and choose.

179
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,425
Hello.

180
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:08,094
Bakangai is now open.

181
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,063
We're now opening. Come on in.

182
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,364
OPEN

183
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,267
A SEAFOOD MARKET

184
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:17,370
TRANSFORMED INTO A SEAFOOD BUFFET

185
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:22,375
It got crowded all of a sudden.

186
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,156
Hello. Excuse me.

187
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,859
Where should we go?

188
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:42,195
We have got to get blowfish.
That's what this place is known for.

189
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,564
Wow, this…

190
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,865
Can we eat it just like this?

191
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,168
Yes, you can.

192
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,103
Most people enjoy it by the ocean.

193
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,639
-We should buy this here.
-Yes.

194
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:53,940
How much is it?

195
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:55,775
BLOWFISH SASHIMI

00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:58,411
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

198
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:01,214
-Can I get your autograph?
-Okay.

199
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:06,186
-Si-kyung.
-Me too?

200
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:07,687
Yes.

201
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:09,756
Si-kyung. Sung Si-kyung.

202
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,460
One, two, three.

203
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,596
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

204
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,031
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

205
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:19,733
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

206
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,670
Can I have a crab cream croquette

207
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,372
-and a bottle of beer?
-Sure.

208
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,413
I really want to try
the crab cream croquette.

209
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,481
Hello.

210
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,983
-Crab cream croquette.
-Yes.

211
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,619
-We would like a crab cream croquette…
-Yes.

212
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:43,256
-…a fried blowfish and a fried rice cake.
-Sure.

213
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:45,291
-That'll be all.
-Okay.

-Thank you.
-Excuse me.

219
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,540
What about this place?

220
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,177
Welcome.

221
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,816
-There are various toppings.
-Yes.

222
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,118
I've never seen that before.

223
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:14,354
It's amazing.

224
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,357
-We'll have the two-topping gunkan.
-This one.

225
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:18,892
-We'd like the fin, please.
-Sure.

226
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:22,562
What else should we get? Is this enough?

227
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:25,398
How about fried octopus?

228
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:27,000
-Shall we get some?
-Let's get some.

229
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,002
Oh, this is fried blowfish.

230
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,858
-Blowfish and octopus.
-We'll have both.

231

00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:38,912
It's 3,100 yen.

235
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,982
It feels like
I'm grocery shopping with my dad.

236
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,819
-Thank you.
-Let's go over there.

237
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:47,821
Let's ask them again

238
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,155
if they remember your name.

239
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,458
I'm sure they won't.

240
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:52,992
They definitely won’t remember.

241
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:57,897
Octopus!

242
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:11,177
-Number one!
-Thank you.

243
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:14,013
-Yes.
-Your name is now "Number One."

244
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,182
Do you sell crab miso soup?

245
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,151
-Yes.
-Broth.

246
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:21,754
One crab miso soup
and one blowfish soup, please.

247
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,223
-Thank you.
-That'll be 1,000 yen.

248
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,058
-We'll take one of these too.
-Sure.

249
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,826
-Yes, thank you.
-Fried cod.

250
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,295
-Yes.
-With tartar sauce.

251
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,231
A lot of sauce, please.

-What was his name?
-Yes.

255
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:36,169
Mr. Matsushige.

256
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:38,138
-She remembered.
-She remembered.

257
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,140
-You're more popular than I thought.
-It's 400 yen.

258
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:41,941
-I am popular these days.
-It's 400 yen.

259
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,576
Welcome.

260
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,211
She's funny.

261
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,981
This one looks really good.

262
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,016
-You came as promised.
-Yes.

263
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,653
-I was set on getting them here.
-You know which shop is good.

264
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,288
-Of course.
-Thank you.

265
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,990
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

266
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:58,391
-Careful.
-Yes.

267
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,692
-Stay healthy.
-You got this!

268
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,094
Thank you.

269
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,796
-We need more hands.
-Nice.

270
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,833
The broth is nice.

271
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,601
-Things are basically sweet…
-It's sweet.

272
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,604
-…in Kyushu.
-The food here tends to be sweet.

273
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,106
Where should we eat this?

274
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,874
This place is nice.

275
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,010
Amazing.

276
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,278
This is so cool.

277
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:23,016
-What a view.
-Amazing.

278
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,019
It's like a movie.
I've never seen water flow so quickly.

279
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,389
-Wouldn’t the strong currents…
-It's so pretty.

280
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,859
…naturally make the fish taste better?

281
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:34,661
-Because they have to swim desperately.
-Yes.

282
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,165
Everyone's just sitting there peacefully.

283
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,834
-With family, with lovers…
-They gather around

284
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:45,939
and enjoy the seafood.

285
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,440
This place is so nice.

286
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,009
-Since it’s crowded down here…
-Yes.

287
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,477
…they have space upstairs.

288
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,779
-There's an upstairs?
-Yes.

289
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:53,846
-Okay.
-Shall we go?

290
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:58,685
In Korea, there are also many places
where the first floor is for wholesale,

291
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:02,422
and the second floor
is where regular customers can eat.

292
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:07,460
Something major
is happening at Karato Market.

293
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:11,731
-It's a fritter festival.
-It's an unexpected fritter festival.

294
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:12,899
It is.

295
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,902
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

296
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,848
From the sweet dessert market to…

297
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,517
-Danjjan danjjan.
-Danjjan danjjan.

298
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,885
-Yes.
-Danjjan danjjan.

299
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,420
-Yes.
-So this is the salty part.

300
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,521
-Jjan.
-Yes. Jjan.

301
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,956
-Jjan.
-Salty. Jjan.

302
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:39,459
-Is it the same pronunciation as "cheers"?
-Yes. It's the same.

303
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:40,426
-Jjan.
-Jjan.

304
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,829
-Danjjan.
-Jjan.

305
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:46,432
-Which one should we start with first?
-Which one should we eat first?

306
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,135
First, this is blowfish.

307
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,071
Blowfish is expensive.

308
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,906
It’s a premium fish.

309
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,776
This is ponzu sauce and this is…

310
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:58,745
-momiji oroshi.
-Momiji oroshi.

311
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,414
What is a momiji oroshi?

312
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:05,685
If you poke holes in a radish,
fill the holes with red chilis,

313
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:08,354
-and grind them together…
-Oh…

314
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:10,623
-It turns pink.
-…it turns pink.

315
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,159
Let's sprinkle this on.

316
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:17,830
I'll try it first.

317
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:36,316
Delicious.

318
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:37,550
Blowfish.

319
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:41,154
You wouldn’t expect to be able to eat
blowfish at a seafood market, right?

320
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:44,624
In Korea too, places like
Noryangjin or Garak Market

321
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,459
don’t really deal with blowfish.

322
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:48,528
You have to go to
a specialty blowfish restaurant.

323
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,763
So it's interesting that
they sell blowfish

324
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,831
in Karato Market.

325
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,733
Right? Blowfish soup.

326
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:57,070
BLOWFISH SOUP

327
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:58,471
-Crab miso soup.
-Yes.

328
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:00,440
CRAB MISO SOUP

329
00:14:00,827 --> 00:14:03,810
It's interesting that they added
miso to blowfish soup.

330
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,846
-Blowfish soup in Korea…
-Yes.

331
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,247
…has a clear broth.

332
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,916
We don't add soybean paste.

333
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,220
Japanese crab broth
almost always includes miso.

334
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,989
Oh, it's sweet.

335
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,395
This sweetness… Is miso normally sweet?

336
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:26,265
There are different types of miso,
not just rice miso.

337
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:30,036
Like barley miso, for example.

338
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,238
This region specifically uses
only sweet barley miso.

339
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,241
So to this day,

340
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,110
I only eat barley miso soup.

341
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,947
Usually in Tokyo,

342
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:44,150
the miso soup that comes with set meals

343
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,153
uses standard salty miso,

344
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,122
-not rice or barley miso.
-Right.

345
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,791
I like sweet flavors,
so I eat it like this.

346
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:54,994
I even buy the miso separately.

347
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,696
It is an acquired taste.

348
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,297
I see.

349
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,466
-Shall we try the sushi?
-Yes.

350
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,702
Oh, they gave us soy sauce.

351
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:05,738
As I said before,
Kyushu soy sauce is sweet.

352
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,508
-Kyushu soy sauce?
-Because it's Kyushu soy sauce.

353
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:12,879
I dip sashimi in really sweet soy sauce.

354
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:16,215
Here.

355
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,451
I want to start with the shrimp.

356
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,387
-Can I try it?
-Go ahead.

357
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,809
The producers probably want to include

358
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:45,278
-tips on the right way to eat sushi…
-Yes.

359
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,814
…how to dip it in soy sauce
with your hands,

360
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:51,050
and other etiquette tips like that.

361
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:53,953
But it doesn’t seem like
he's a sushi expert.

362
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,354
You put too much sauce on it.

363
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:58,791
I’ve never seen anyone dip
only the sashimi in the sauce.

364
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:00,159
You don't do that?

365
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,595
I don't think
I have ever done that before.

366
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:06,566
See, if you dip the rice in soy sauce,

367
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:10,436
-the grains start falling apart.
-Right.

368
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:11,671
I don’t like that.

369
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:16,309
So in those cases,
I pull the sashimi off and dip it.

370
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:20,379
It feels like the seasoning
turns out just right that way.

371
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,815
That's how Mr. Matjjigae does it.

372
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:24,884
It's just my personal opinion.

373
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,953
-Shall I try it?
-Go ahead.

374
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:31,557
Yes. That's perfect.

375
00:16:35,964 --> 00:16:37,530
-Right?
-Yes.

376
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:38,898
It's delicious.

377
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:42,502
It’s market sushi, so it doesn’t
really matter how you eat it.

378
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,036
-Is this belly meat?
-Yes.

379
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,807
It's expensive, but it's that good.

380
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:49,208
Was this expensive?

381
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,211
-It was over 500 yen per piece.
-Right, 500 yen per piece.

382
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,088
This is blackthroat seaperch.

383
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,826
Delicious.

384
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,464
It's so good. This is…

385
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,232
It's blackthroat seaperch.

386
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:15,301
-It is blackthroat seaperch.
-It's good.

387
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:18,204
Blackthroat seaperch is
better grilled than raw.

388
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:20,773
This is slightly grilled.

389
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,817
I'm going to try the blowfish.

390
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,559
It feels like there's too much rice.

391
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:41,360
One third of it is rice.

392
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:44,797
I'll try the milt.

393
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,333
The milt one is quite big, isn't it?

394
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,035
There is a lot of rice.

395
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,304
They are like rice balls.

396
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,540
-You're right.
-It's heavy, right?

397
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,046
Good job.

398
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:03,883
Using your upper jaw like that?
Now that’s a true master move.

399
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:09,755
That gunkan sushi really lives up to
its name. The portion’s like a battleship.

400
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:13,159
This isn’t a battleship.
It’s an aircraft carrier.

401
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:20,566
Let me try too.

402
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:28,007
This place is so fun, though.

403
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:29,008
It's fun.

404
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,143
-It is delicious, but…
-Yes.

405
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,779
This isn’t the kind of place

406
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,215
where you’ll find
the very best sushi in Japan.

407
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,651
It's a tourist spot and has a nice view.

408
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:41,420
It's fun and charming.

409
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:42,521
-The vibe?
-Yes.

410
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:45,658
When the starting bell rings
at the market,

411
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:48,427
everyone shops with such excitement.

412
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,499
-And there’s a fun vibe to eating sushi…
-Yes.

413
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,301
…while watching the strait.

414
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:59,505
I'm going to try
the crab cream croquette now.

415
00:19:00,401 --> 00:19:03,309
CRAB CREAM CROQUETTE

416
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:05,911
FRIED BLOWFISH

417
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,248
FRIED COD

418
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,184
Crab cream croquette.

419
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:18,691
Was it freshly fried?

420
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,494
-It's not cold yet.
-It's not cold yet, but…

421
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,629
-No, it's good.
-Really?

422
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:26,632
It would’ve been really good
if I’d eaten it fresh out of the fryer.

423
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:28,501
What do you think?

424
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,503
-Not bad, right?
-Yes.

425
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,506
Yes, you can taste the crab.

426
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:42,481
It’s not like a “Wow, delicious!” moment
the second you bite into it, but…

427
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,183
-The name fits after all.
-Yes.

428
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,085
"It's crab cream croquette."

429
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,757
Next is this tartar.

430
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:54,060
-You like tartar sauce, right?
-I do.

431
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,528
-Goro likes tartar.
-Yes.

432
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:56,696
-I…
-What about you?

433
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,831
-I like salad maki
-Yes.

434
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:00,232
and tartar sauce.

435
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,437
-You seem to like down-to-earth things.
-Yes.

436
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:11,343
-How is it?
-Oh!

437
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,213
-This one gets an "Oh!"?
-It's good.

438
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,948
The tartar is just…

439
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:18,684
This tastes like McDonald’s Filet-O-Fish.

440
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:21,554
That's my favorite thing in the world.

441
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,290
This tastes like McDonald’s Filet-O-Fish.

442
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:27,860
Right?

443
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,895
-With cheese and bread…
-Yes.

444
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,197
Cheese, bread,

445
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:34,100
-and minced pickles…
-That’s basically McDonald’s.

446
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,801
That's right.

447
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:38,104
In Korea, they got rid of

448
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,473
-the Filet-O-Fish without warning.
-Why?

449
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,975
I went to get one,
but it was already gone.

450
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,343
-Filet-O-Fish?
-Yes.

451
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,212
They got rid of it from the world?

452
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,080
When it was taken off the menu in Korea,

453
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:50,649
I even thought about protesting alone.

454
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:52,885
So every time I come to Japan,

455
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:56,355
I go to McDonald's
before starting my schedule.

456
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,857
Did they bring it back?

457
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,292
They didn't, right?

458
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:03,129
I don't think it was that popular.

459
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,864
There is no way.

460
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,665
-But it's so good.
-I don't know.

461
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,901
-It's so good.
-I'm not sure why.

462
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,471
We forgot to try
the most important fried blowfish.

463
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:16,175
You can only have this here.

464
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,416
It's hard.

465
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:30,823
-What was this again?
-Blowfish.

466
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,358
This is the boneless one.

467
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:34,493
Not bad.

468
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,195
-This is it.
-This is good.

469
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,230
So I recommend

470
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,367
buying your favorite fritters, beer,

471
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:44,804
and sushi with your favorite sashimi.

472
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,939
And miso soup is a must.

473
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:49,441
And the crab cream croquette
is really good.

474
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:51,076
-And Filet-O-Fish.
-And Filet-O-Fish.

475
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,912
The tuna belly
I had earlier was delicious.

476
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,747
-Yes.
-And the blackthroat seaperch.

477
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,550
So you can choose whatever fish you like.

478
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:04,056
Who you spend time with is
more important than what you eat.

479
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:06,892
I'm sure anything
will be delicious if I eat it with you,

480
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:09,128
but their crab cream croquette
was delicious.

481
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:11,497
I wish they would fry the fritters

482
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:15,267
right before we eat them.

483
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,036
They all make it in advance.

484
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:18,470
-It gets cold.
-It gets cold.

485
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:20,873
Mr. Matjjigae.

486
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,909
If I keep doing this program,
I might open a restaurant someday.

487
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:25,277
It's giving me all kinds of ideas.

488
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:28,047
What are we going to do about
the chapssal donuts?

489
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,481
-Shall we?
-Shall we open a shop?

490
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:31,016
-Yes.
-Now that I think about it,

491
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,952
a lot of offers have been
coming in from Korea.

492
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,053
-Really?
-Commercials.

493
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,955
-Let's do it.
-Let's do it together.

494
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:36,889
Let's do it together.

495
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:39,091
We could do a banana milk commercial.

496
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:41,760
Banana milk? "This is delicious!"

497
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:43,963
-"It's the best."
-"Danjjan danjjan. It's delicious."

498
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,932
"Danjjan danjjan banana milk!"

499
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,134
-We can do anything.
-We'll do anything.

500
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,438
-I've done everything I was told to do.
-Right?

501
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:55,307
I've done everything
from zombies to aliens.

502
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,109
I'm fine with anything.

503
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,279
Let's do some research.

504
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:01,747
What would be good?

505
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:03,015
THE NEXT INSANELY GOOD SPOT

506
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:06,852
UDON

507
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:08,621
THE UDON FROM
MATSUSHIGE'S BOYHOOD MEMORIES

508
00:23:23,371 --> 00:23:25,371
