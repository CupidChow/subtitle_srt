1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,269
THE RECONNAISSANCE IS OVER

2
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:03,737
THE REAL TASTE EXCHANGE BEGINS NOW

3
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:04,771
Today's a competition.

4
00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:07,407
-We're at war. Come on!
-I'll show him what we got.

5
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:10,577
-I don't like losing.
-I'm sorry, but I won.

6
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:12,479
FLAVOR OF KOREA VS FLAVOR OF JAPAN

7
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:13,614
OCTOPUS VS SQUID

8
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,648
DUCK VS CHICKEN

9
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:16,517
SUNDAE-GUKBAP VS TONKOTSU RAMEN

10
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:23,223
I mean, there's a subtle kind of tension.

11
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,224
Like a power struggle.

12
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:27,861
And now, the Korean dish
that'll go up against it…

13
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:29,997
-There is one.
-I don't know…

14
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:32,666
-Like a hidden menu?
-Yes.

15
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:35,802
Oh, Chicken Pop!

16
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:36,904
HIS FAVORITE SNACK

17
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,272
Chicken Pop!

18
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:40,307
INSANE FLAVOR EXCHANGE

19
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,347
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

20
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:49,182
-It's good.
-Yes!

21
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:50,350
INSANE FOOD TOUR

22
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:54,821
Smells like the countryside out here.
Fresh and clean.

23
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:56,390
We should head outside of Seoul.

24
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,825
-This is insane.
-It's insane.

25
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:00,661
-Matjjigae budaejjigae.
-It is insane.

26
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,463
-This is insane. I'm going to cry.
-Delicious. This is insane.

27
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:05,465
This is delicious.

28
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:06,667
This is insane.

29
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,035
THIS IS INSANE

30
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:12,539
FIRST ROUND

31
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:19,146
CHARCOAL-GRILLED DUCK

EPISODE 14
WILD INSTINCTS, NATIVE CHICKEN ON CHARCOAL

33
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:29,623
K-foodie meets J-foodie.

34
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,791
This is insane.

35
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:36,830
TIME TO OFFICIALLY SWAP FLAVORS

36
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:38,932
FUKUOKA, JAPAN

37
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,969
FUKUOKA

38
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,070
KUMAMOTO

39
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,772
2 HOUR AND 30 MINUTE DRIVE
THE LONGEST DISTANCE EVER

40
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,342
LEAVING THE CITY BEHIND

41
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:50,944
THEY DRIVE THROUGH THE QUIET COUNTRYSIDE

42
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,680
DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE MOUNTAINS

43
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:57,851
THEY ARRIVE AT
MR. MATJJIGAE'S INSANELY GOOD SPOT

44
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,786
-Okay…
-Where are we?

45
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:00,887
-Mount Aso.
-Mount Aso.

46
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,923
It's called Kusasenri,
located in the Aso Highlands,

47
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:06,259
and it has absolutely stunning scenery.

48
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:13,700
MOUNT ASO, A MASSIVE ACTIVE VOLCANO
IN KUMAMOTO PREFECTURE

49
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,405
This is one of Kyushu's
famous scenic drive routes.

50
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,574
We drove all the way here.

51
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:25,545
Actually, I worked part-time
at some lodgings nearby

52
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:28,882
when I was a student.

53
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:32,152
I happened to be working nearby
not long ago, and I remembered

54
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:35,355
that this place was here,
so I decided to come.

55
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:38,258
I hadn't had it in 20 years,
but it was so good

56
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:42,529
and I thought this place
was perfect for the show.

57
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:46,233
-You were very adamant.
-Yes.

58
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,101
-I was adamant.
-That we had to come here.

59
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:52,105
It's a place where you can enjoy
a different kind of view

60
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,107
-and try something…
-Yes.

61
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,543
-…you've never had before.
-Right.

62
00:02:56,877 --> 00:03:00,981
Do Japanese students work part-time
during summer break?

63
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:05,218
Yes, I worked part-time
at some lodgings back then.

64
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:09,356
-After that…
-My wife was working there too.

65
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:12,592
-Back then…
-She was my girlfriend.

66
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,227
We had just started dating.

67
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:17,898
I'm assuming you were the one
who asked her out?

68
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,399
I honestly don't remember.

69
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,868
-You don't?
-It's been over 40 years.

70
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,371
It just happened naturally.

71
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:26,239
-Naturally?
-Yes.

72
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,507
Yes.

73
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,510
They say
they're in the middle of a war.

74
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:34,147
CURRENTLY IN THE MIDDLE
OF A FIERCE SHOWDOWN

75
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:35,949
Normally…

76
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:38,218
-They're in the middle of a war.
-Yes.

77
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:41,455
-A war with meat, right?
-Yes. They're in the middle of a showdown.

78
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,591
Is Mr. Matjjigae going to go crazy again?

79
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:47,027
-When he had yakiniku…
-Grrr.

80
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:50,497
I'm going to become a beast for real.

81
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,165
Don't abandon me.

82
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,600
-Follow me.
-Not like before.

83
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:54,601
Okay.

84
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,169
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

85
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:59,039
-It smells good.
-Smells good.

86
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,508
So this is the vibe.

87
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,543
I like it.

88
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,514
They're grilling it.

89
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,316
They're grilling it.

90
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,719
They serve native chicken.

91
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:18,592
It's grilled over an irori
and it tastes amazing.

92
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:23,897
IRORI, A TRADITIONAL JAPANESE SUNKEN
HEARTH USED FOR BOTH COOKING AND HEATING

93
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,467
A MOUNTAIN CABIN
WITH CHARCOAL-GRILLED NATIVE CHICKEN

94
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,836
Grrr.

95
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:32,439
It's warm.

96
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:34,641
It's nice and warm.

97
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:39,880
This place is nice.
The vibe has already won me over.

98
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,314
This place is nice.

99
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,217
It already smells so good.

100
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:49,823
The smell of charcoal, smoke,
fresh wood from nature,

101
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,592
-and a hint of burnt oil.
-Right?

102
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:56,196
And this building soaks it all up.

103
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,365
That's what's interesting to me. In Korea,

104
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:03,069
they would install ventilators everywhere.

105
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,105
But in Japan, they just let it…

106
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:06,273
You get covered in smoke.

107
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,774
-Right?
-Yes.

108
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,910
I love places like this.

109
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:10,877
-It's nice, right?
-Yes.

110
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,014
It takes a while to grill…

111
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,348
-So let's order quickly.
-Yes.

112
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,150
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

113
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,753
-Excuse me.
-Hello. Thank you.

114
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,054
-Thank you.
-No problem.

115
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,158
I'll take the mother hen,
with tougher meat.

116
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:27,527
GRILLED MOTHER HEN

117
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,362
-Is there a more tender one?
-Here.

118
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,630
That's the young one.

119
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,099
I want to order them both and compare.

120
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,434
GRILLED YOUNG CHICKEN

121
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,770
-I'll have the homemade sausage too.
-Sausages too.

122
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,405
-I heard it's good.
-Yes.

123
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,140
HOMEMADE SAUSAGES

124
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:45,145
This is also interesting.
We don't eat mother hen in Korea.

125
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:47,614
-We usually use it for broth.
-Yes.

126
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:51,351
The mother hen has worked hard
and laid a lot of eggs,

127
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:55,255
so we like to give her a proper send-off.

128
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,224
She worked hard.

129
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,560
Mother hens have long
been eaten in Kyushu.

130
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:04,464
People used to raise them,
have them fight in cockfights,

131
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,533
-and then cook them afterward.
-I see.

132
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:10,370
They'd eat the losing hens,
thinking they were bad luck.

133
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,407
-They don't do that now, right?
-They just buy them now.

134
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:15,909
We won a gold medal.

135
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,211
You're going to have beer, right?

136
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,181
-Yes.
-Why did you say it like that?

137
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,817
-I just love the vibe--
-Okay. Just be quiet.

138
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,719
-We'll have a beer.
-One draft beer, please.

139
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:28,088
-Thank you.
-Sure.

140
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:32,259
A Korean coming all the way from Fukuoka,
driving two and a half hours,

141
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,861
to a hidden gem like this in Kumamoto

142
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:37,163
-and not having a beer…
-That is true.

143
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:38,598
That is a crime.

144
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,168
I want to grill the chicken right now.

145
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:44,671
-It's here.
-Excuse me.

146
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,473
-This is the mother hen.
-Mother hen.

147
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,874
-It's the mother hen.
-Mother hen.

148
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:49,576
The mother hen.

149
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,508
-This is one serving? Amazing.
-That's right.

150
00:06:51,586 --> 00:06:52,454

Skin side down.

171
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,267
-Can I try?
-Sure.

172
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:48,601
-Skin side down?
-Yes.

173
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:57,010
When you can cut it with
a pair of scissors, it's perfectly cooked.

174
00:07:58,812 --> 00:07:59,913
It looks delicious.

175
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:08,088
Last time, a dozen or so of us
sat around the irori,

176
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:10,023
and the amount of meat was insane.

177
00:08:13,121 --> 00:08:16,550
THEY CAME AS A GROUP

178
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:21,134
AND TOOK OVER THREE IRORI

179
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:24,104
It looked amazing

180
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,874
covered with meat back then,

181
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,343
but with just the two of us,
it feels a little empty.

182
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:33,847
-Let's do our best and grill away.
-We'll just have to give it our all.

183
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:39,753
I think this one
is already cooked through.

184
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,521
-It's not cooked yet.
-Not yet?

185
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,025
It takes a while, right?

186
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,528
Mr. Matjjiage is in a hurry to eat.

187
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,096
Can we eat it now?

188
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,166
-It's not…
-Oh, it's hot! My hand!

189
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,538
I can tell you're eager to dig in.

190
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,573
Is it done?

191
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,511
I'll be able to tell if I taste it.

192
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,514
-Thank you for the food.
-Go ahead.

193
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:10,950
The mother hen.

194
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,493
How is it?

195
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,566
This is insane.

196
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,802
It's delicious.

197
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:30,236
-Really?
-Yes.

198
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:35,508
It's a bit tough and hard to eat,

199
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,844
so it could be an acquired taste.

200
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:41,247
If anything, the chewy texture

201
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:48,054
gives it that satisfying feel,
like you're really eating something.

202
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:54,861
You know, normally

203
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:59,632
when you take a foreigner
to your favorite restaurant,

204
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,535
you wait for them to eat first
to see their reaction.

205
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,775
But Mr. Matjjigae tastes it first
to see if it's good or not.

206
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,645
Well, you want to be a little wild
when you come to places like this.

207
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,348
The mother hen.

208
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:36,136
This is insane.

209
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,006
This is very charming.

210
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:43,376
It's tough,
so you have to chew it thoroughly.

211
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:47,413
But the more you chew,
the more flavorful it becomes.

212
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,384
The fat tastes a bit different.

213
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:57,323
You think you'll be able
to find this in Korea, but you can't.

214
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:01,761
-Is that so?
-When you have native chicken in Korea,

215
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:06,065
we usually make it as tender as possible

216
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:12,305
by pressure cooking
or simmering it for a long time.

217
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,440
But this chewy texture is charming

218
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:16,442
and it really feels like
you're eating meat.

219
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:18,378
It feels like you're eating it
the primitive way.

220
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:22,582
I bet a lot of Japanese people
would be like, "What is this?"

221
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,118
"What is this chewy texture?"

222
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:29,756
-The seasoning is spot on, too.
-Right?

223
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:33,826
It makes me crave beer and rice.

224
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:36,129
You want to have rice and beer?

225
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:38,531
It's not just basic seasoning.

226
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,533
It's got a complex, layered flavor.

227
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,903
-I think it's soy sauce and ginger…
-Soy sauce…

228
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,172
It has a strong ginger flavor.
I taste sansho too.

229
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,774
Sansho and…

230
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:52,378
-The rich aroma and savory depth…
-Yes.

231
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,414
…from the chicken's natural fat…

232
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:10,964
What?

233
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:12,799
It's already gone?

234
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,201
I barely got to eat.

235
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,073
I don't want to go
to a yakiniku place with him.

236
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:25,211
When we're grilling food,
it's like he's not even here.

237
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,946
Try it.

238
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,764
Can I take one of yours?

239
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,635
I could eat this forever.

240
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,807
-This is the war.
-Yes.

241
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:58,645
CURRENTLY IN THE MIDDLE
OF A FIERCE SHOWDOWN

242
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,414
This is the mother hen, right?

243
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:02,782
-Yes, the mother hen.
-Yes.

244
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:04,083
This is the young chicken?

245
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,890
-Is it the young chicken?
-Yes.

246
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,660
Oh, I get it!

247
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:17,563
It's different. It's completely different.

248
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,998
-It's totally different.
-It is.

249
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,368
MOTHER HEN, OYADORI

250
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:25,405
YOUNG CHICKEN, WAKADORI

251
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:29,342
MOTHER HEN VS YOUNG CHICKEN

252
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:32,779
FIRM AND SPRINGY MEAT WITH A CHEWY TEXTURE

253
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,682
TENDER AND JUICY MEAT WITH A SOFT TEXTURE

254
00:13:36,169 --> 00:13:38,918
COARSE, FIRM MOTHER HEN

255
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:44,257
TENDER YOUNG CHICKEN

256
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,671
YOUNG CHICKEN

257
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:50,763
What do you think?

258
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:58,204
I'm used to the flavor of young chicken.

259
00:13:58,271 --> 00:13:59,539
The texture, I mean.

260
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,774
-The mother hen…
-You've never had it before, right?

261
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,977
What was that thing
I asked about at Toritaka again?

262
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,045
IN EPISODE 4

263
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:07,580
Was it misaki?

264
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,550
It had a texture I'd never tasted before.
This is pretty similar to that.

265
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:14,153
MISAKI, THE MOTHER HEN'S TAIL
KNOWN FOR ITS CHEWY, SPRINGY TEXTURE

266
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,357
-I prefer the mother hen.
-I see.

267
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,828
I suggest Koreans get half and half.

268
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:26,299
They should experience the difference.
Or they could regret missing out.

269
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,433
Right.

270
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,269
Let me try the young chicken again.

271
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,071
Okay.

272
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,441
What do you think?

273
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,145
Never mind. I take it back.
The young chicken is good too.

274
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,783
Young chicken with rice is the best.

275
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,253
Is this good with rice too?

276
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,727
And if you do come here,
make sure to order yuzu pepper.

277
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:56,262
It's only 1,100 won.

278
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:57,864
It's delicious.

279
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:58,831
YUZU PEPPER

280
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,200
A SPICY, TANGY SEASONING
MADE FROM FERMENTED YUZU PEEL

281
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,072
Thank you.

282
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:07,940
-It's good, right?
-It is.

283
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,711
I've never had their sausage before.

284
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:14,147
Ddeugeowo!

285
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,015
What? Ddeugeowo?

286
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,617
-It means hot.
-Ddeugeowo.

287
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:18,951
Ddeugeowo means hot.

288
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,887
-Ddeugeowo!
-Ddeugeowo!

289
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,388
-Perfect.
-Ddeugeowo.

290
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,959
-Okay, this one is done.
-It's done?

291
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,300
It's hot!

292
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,506
Homemade sausages are good too.

293
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,276
The juice just gushes out.

294
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,146
This sausage is really good.

295
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,283
They are good at making things like these.

296
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,389
How should we eat the egg?

297
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:58,391
We should mix it into the rice.

298
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,731
Just add the yolk…

299
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:07,633
MR. MATJJIGAE'S EGG RICE

300
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,204
1. ADD THE YOLK TO THE RICE

301
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:15,475
When you make egg rice,
do you normally only add the yolk?

302
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,276
It's a personal preference of mine.

303
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,513
-I just want to enjoy the rice on its own…
-I see.

304
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:23,549
…so I'm only adding the yolk.

305
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:25,551
-Because it gets mushy?
-Yes.

306
00:16:27,682 --> 00:16:32,024
2. ADD SOY SAUCE TO THE RICE AND MIX

307
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:40,199
The part that has
a lot of yolk is the best.

308
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:43,903
Should I try it too?

309
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,071
SI-KYUNG'S OYAKODON

310
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:48,641
1. CUT THE CHICKEN INTO PIECES
AND ADD THEM TO THE RICE

311
00:16:50,513 --> 00:16:53,112
2. ADD THE EGG WHITE AND YOLK

312
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,413
Here I go.

313
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,151
-Looks good, right?
-It does.

314
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:01,621
You added the whole egg.

315
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:11,998
Wow, it's delicious.

316
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:17,537
Oyakodon is
the most brutal dish in the world.

317
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,639
OYAKODON

318
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,573
PARENT

319
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,507
CHILD

320
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,476
RICE WITH TOPPINGS

321
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,777
CHICKEN (PARENT)

322
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:27,847
EGG (CHILD)

323
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:29,048
It's delicious.

324
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,370
Wow, I was so absorbed in eating.

325
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,106
I can still eat more.

326
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,710
Excuse me.

327
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:03,616
Can you change the grill and bring us
three servings of meat, please?

328
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,251
-Mother hen.
-Okay.

329
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:11,557
-You know, being in front of a fire…
-Yes?

330
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:16,329
-…it makes people honest.
-Yes.

331
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,497
Since we're in front of a fire,

332
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:21,767
be honest with me, Si-kyung.

333
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,304
What's on your mind right now?

334
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,472
Your love life?

335
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,741
-No, I'm thinking about working in Japan.
-No?

336
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,743
You're thinking about working in Japan?

337
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:35,348
I'm having a concert in Japan in October.

338
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,716
I see.

339
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:39,485
For a singer like me, who is not an idol,

340
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:42,722
there aren't many chances
to perform in such big venues.

341
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,791
I want to show my juniors
that even a singer

342
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:49,895
who's not an idol can succeed in Japan.

343
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:55,034
I want to show my best side,

344
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:58,738
and be on music shows and do interviews,

345
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:02,108
-but I'm not sure if things will go well.
-I see.

346
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,745
Even though you get flustered

347
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:09,582
dealing with this old Japanese man…

348
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,050
-No…
-…on this show,

349
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,920
I think you've grown quite popular

350
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,256
showing how smoothly you bantered
with me in fluent Japanese.

351
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:19,659
-Is that so?
-It'd be great if you could…

352
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:22,261
-Yes.
-…highlight that part

353
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:23,763
-to the audience.
-Yes.

354
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:26,599
I'll do my best
to try lots of things from now on.

355
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:27,833
Hang in there.

356
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:30,002
It's here.

357
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,739
-Wow, three servings.
-Three servings.

358
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:34,940
Nice.

359
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:36,609
I'll start grilling them.

360
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,479
It's not because I want to eat it.

361
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:43,916
I want all the staff to taste it.

362
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,218
Isn't it because
you want to eat it yourself?

363
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:47,486
I do want to eat it.

364
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:56,829
-I think you put too much on the grill.
-This is the perfect amount.

365
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:02,635
It feels way more wild and untamed,
you know?

366
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:05,538
It looks better this way, right?

367
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:07,106
This…

368
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,342
-In the cabin…
-Yes?

369
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:12,545
The cameraman also nodded.

370
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:17,416
-Once it cooks, things will get hectic.
-Right.

371
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:19,251
-Cut it quickly.
-Okay.

372
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,686
-Here I go.
-Let's go!

373
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:22,354
We're at war!

374
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:26,225
Now's not the time to relax.

375
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:28,561
Now…

376
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:32,064
I can't even sit down. It has become war.

377
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,866
I think you were being too greedy.

378
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,501
-It's fine.
-It's fine?

379
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:37,336
Oh, my leg.

380
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:39,972
I'm so tired.

381
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:48,013
It's hot.

382
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:54,453
-Ddeugeowo.
-Ddeugeowo.

383
00:20:56,355 --> 00:21:00,292
The fire got bigger

384
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,428
because of the juice and fat of the meat.

385
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:04,163
It's hot!

386
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,164
REFER TO EPISODE 7

387
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:08,567
-Should we get radish to control the fire?
-We don't have that in Japan.

388
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:12,438
Koreans think differently.

389
00:21:14,035 --> 00:21:16,442
USING CABBAGE INSTEAD OF RADISH
TO CONTROL THE FIRE

390
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:19,745
-The fire subsided.
-Amazing.

391
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,080
-Not bad, right?
-Yes.

392
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,350
The meat is still too tough.
We can't cut it yet.

393
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,987
If you swap the meat on the outside with
the meat at the center, it'll cook evenly.

394
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:30,923
You are a pro. A fire pro.

395
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:34,326
It's so hot
that it could actually burn my hand.

396
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,364
Move it to the plate and then cut it.
Otherwise, it'll be too hot.

397
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,266
You're smart.

398
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:44,603
I can't believe you studied
for three years for university.

399
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,577
Does everyone have chopsticks?

400
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:56,949
Eat.

401
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:59,752
Everyone, dig in.

402
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:01,320
What do you think?

403
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:02,688
-It's delicious.
-Right?

404
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,861
Eating it like this is the best.

405
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:10,996
Yes, it's as if we're camping.

406
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:14,333
-Is everyone eating?
-Eat. Dig in.

407
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,869
-The rice is so good.
-It's so good.

408
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:21,173
It's not a texture you come across
every day, right?

409
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,641
-It's delicious.
-It's delicious?

410
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:24,310
It's the best.

411
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:30,115
When it's really good, somehow
Mr. Matjjigae starts to look adorable.

412
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,819
I should take him
to a place like this in Korea.

413
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:36,455
We've got ssam, kimchi, and stew.

414
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,526
We should head outside of Seoul.

415
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:43,162
Duck or chicken… Yes…

416
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:44,430
NEXT INSANELY GOOD SPOT

417
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:47,800
CHARCOAL-GRILLED DUCK
VS CHARCOAL-GRILLED CHICKEN

418
00:22:48,296 --> 00:22:51,023
CHARCOAL-GRILLED DUCK

419
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,560
