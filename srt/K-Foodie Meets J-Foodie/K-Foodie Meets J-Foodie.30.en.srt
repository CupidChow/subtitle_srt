EATING NOTES

2
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:06,540
AN ESSAY ABOUT FOOD, CAPTURING MEMORIES
TIED TO MATSUSHIGE'S SOUL FOOD

3
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:13,146
Once filming began,

4
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:17,918
I would head from Tokyo to Kyoto and
stay there for several days at a time.

5
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:24,057
One day, while wandering around
looking for something to eat,

6
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,393
a small sign caught my eye.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,130
It read "Simmered Mackerel Kazuki."

8
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:34,835
It was a tiny place
with only five counter seats.

9
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,471
And there wasn't a single customer inside.

10
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:38,672
HAPPINESS

11
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:41,742
I'm going to need courage
if I'm going to go inside.

12
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:47,047
I peeked into the empty shop,

13
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:51,752
and my eyes met those of the lady
behind the counter.

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,290
I carefully opened the door
and stepped inside.

15
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:00,093
The petite lady greeted me
with a warm smile.

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,164
"Welcome.
I saw you hesitating outside for a while."

17
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,434
She seemed like the kind of person

18
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:12,039
who always wanted to share
the food she enjoyed with others.

19
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:17,578
The mackerel,
simmered in a sweet soy sauce,

20
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:21,648
was perfectly rich, making each bite
of the rice go down effortlessly.

21
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,954
The simmered mackerel I had there
was nothing short of astonishing.

22
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:32,693
After that day, I went there every day.

23
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:40,367
EPISODE 29
A KYOTO MOTHER'S SIMMERED MACKEREL

24
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:43,570
-We are…
-Where are we?

25
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,372
-Kyoto…
-Yes.

26
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,707
ON-THE-ROAD FOOD BATTLE, KYOTO

27
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,179
The truth is,
the shop we're going to today

28
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:55,616
was run by the current owner's mother,

29
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,684
someone I was really close to.

30
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:00,120
-It's in your book, right?
-It is.

31
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,521
-Eating Notes.
-The mackerel shop.

32
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,156
-It was in Eating Notes.
-I read it.

33
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,626
To me, it truly

34
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:10,197
felt like home in Kyoto. So much so that
I came to call her my Kyoto mother.

35
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,733
-Did her son take over?
-He did.

36
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,168
I went there really often.

37
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,303
-Shall we go in?
-Yes.

38
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,038
-Okay.
-Let's go.

39
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:22,376
RYOSEN

40
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,411
It looks strangely cleaner than before.

41
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:26,346
Hello!

42
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,181
-It's been a while.
-It's been a while.

43
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,583
-Excuse me.
-Hello.

44
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,784
It's been a while.

45
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:33,620
-You're back.
-I'm back.

46
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:35,422
-Hello. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

47
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,859
TODAY'S INSANELY GOOD SPOT
IZAKAYA, RYOSEN

48
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:43,196
IZAKAYA, A JAPANESE-STYLE BAR WHERE
PEOPLE ENJOY DRINKS AND SIDE DISHES

49
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:45,599
It's been a while.

50
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,134
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

51
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,702
It seems cleaner.

52
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:51,772
-I got a haircut for today's shoot.
-Just your hair?

53
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,274
-I lost some weight.
-I can tell.

54
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,209
It's been a while.

55
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,944
Hello.

56
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,480
She's hiding. She's my wife.

57
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,917
-So, he's the son?
-Yes.

58
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,520
He's like a son to me.

59
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:09,956
Since his mother was always like
a mother to me.

60
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:14,294
Her shop was at another station,

61
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,397
and it was called "Kazuki,"
but it was torn down.

62
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:22,235
That's when her son opened
Ryosen right here.

63
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,603
How long ago was that?

64
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,473
-Was it ten…
-It was 22 years ago.

65
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,874
-What?
-What?

66
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,910
It's been 20 years already.

67
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,012
I am an old man!

68
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,347
-Really? 22 years?
-It's been 20 years already.

69
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:37,217
-I made my debut 25 years ago.
-Sir…

70
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:38,185
Really?

71
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,353
-You were talking about it…
-No, it's not that.

72
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,189
…as if it were 3 or 4 years ago.

73
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:43,790
It feels like it was just yesterday.

74
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:46,393
She used to run the place
at lunchtime here.

75
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:50,030
-It was ten years ago.
-It's already been 10 years?

76
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:53,433
Her lunch business did so well,
the line often stretched out the door.

77
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,803
But unfortunately, his mother

78
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,339
passed away two years ago.

79
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:02,209
Yes, you came to her funeral.

80
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:05,912
So that's the kind of connection you had.

81
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,782
I think of this place
when I think of Kyoto.

82
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,884
-It's your favorite place.
-Yes.

83
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:14,221
Back then… When you were still active?

84
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,289
He knows everything about alcohol.

85
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,958
-An alcohol master.
-I'm excited.

86
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:18,925
I'm happy to serve.

87
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,862
-He's crazy about alcohol.
-I'm looking forward to this.

88
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,632
I launched a makgeolli brand in Korea
under my own name.

89
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,400
-Amazing.
-Yes.

90
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:30,103
Try adding ice

91
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,672
-and melting it while you drink it.
-Thank you.

92
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,942
It goes well with meat like yakiniku.

93
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,811
Can I try it now?

94
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:38,979
-Try it.
-Just a little.

95
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,514
-It's good.
-Drink it with ice.

96
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,448
-Ice.
-Yes.

97
00:04:41,965 --> 00:04:43,817
-Do you want non-alcoholic beer?
-You have some?

98
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:45,085
-I do.
-I'd like some.

99
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:47,821
-What kind of beer do you have?
-Beer?

100
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:48,755
We have draft beer.

101
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,557
-Draft beer, please.
-Okay.

102
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,692
This is so nice.

103
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,928
Drink up today.

104
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,698
It's good to have a drink here.

105
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:02,936
I get kind of jealous
when we come to shops like this.

106
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,438
There aren't many seats,

107
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,742
so you get to know the owner
and chat with them,

108
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,011
and there are plenty of regulars too.

109
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,213
Each place has its own charm,

110
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,783
like izakayas that make you stop outside

111
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:20,287
and peer in, wondering
what that shop is like.

112
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:23,490
-This shop is exactly like that.
-Yes.

113
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,059
-So…
-What kind of beer is that?

114
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,395
It's a Kyoto craft beer
called "Bread in a Past Life."

115
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,897
-Bread in a Life?
-Bread in a Past Life.

116
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:33,767
Simply put, it means
you were a bread in your past life.

117
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,268
You mean wheat, right?

118
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,937
Correct.

119
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,372
-Let's have a toast.
-Let's have a toast.

120
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:40,774
-Cheers.
-Thank you. Jjan.

121
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:41,708
-Thank you.
-Jjan.

122
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:42,876
-Jjan.
-Jjan.

123
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:43,844
-Jjan.
-Jjan.

124
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,146
It's been a while.

125
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,281
-He's really excited.
-Have you been well? Jjan.

126
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,317
-Oh, me too.
-Excuse me. Thank you.

127
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,685
Nice to meet you.

128
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,321
I didn't introduce him. This is Si-kyung.

129
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,990
-He's already so famous.
-No.

130
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,960
You're a great singer.

131
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,262
Singing is just a hobby.

132
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,899
He sings too well for it to be a hobby.

133
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,568
Believe it or not, singing
is actually my main profession.

134
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,447
-What do you think?
-It's good.

135
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,816
-These are appetizers.
-What's this?

136
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:27,153
Vegetables boiled in onion and kelp broth.

137
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:31,024
APPETIZER

138
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:38,999
A SOUP ENRICHED WITH THE SWEETNESS
OF ONIONS AND THE UMAMI OF KELP

139
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,103
Thank you for the food.

140
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,042
Delicious.

141
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:56,950
What is this?

142
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,519
Smells like Western food, doesn't it?

143
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,187
-It's onions.
-Onions?

144
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,322
Yes.

145
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:05,325
-When boiled, it gives off a sweet aroma.
-You're right.

146
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:09,229
It's like a really delicious onion soup.

147
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:11,298
From Shimane prefecture…

148
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,068
-You've gotten better.
-Thank you.

149
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:17,203
Amazing.

150
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,777
-This is amazing.
-It's delicious.

151
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,412
It's a bundle of pure umami.

152
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,480
This is good.

153
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:30,050
This is what you'd call vegan.

154
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,285
It's made only with vegetables and kelp.

155
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:33,820
-Animal products?
-None.

156
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,121
-None at all?
-None.

157
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,457
-Not even sugar.
-You're lying.

158
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:39,626
-No sugar?
-No.

159
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,194
But it's so sweet.

160
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,330
Consommé soup is usually made with meat.

161
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:46,032
But I wanted to capture that flavor
using only vegetables.

162
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:49,669
You said Japan doesn't really have
a culture of drinking up the broth,

163
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,171
but this one's different.

164
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,740
The broth here is really good.

165
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,608
The broth is everything.

166
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:58,445
Is this place kind of like an omakase?

167
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:01,414
Sort of. They always just made
something for me.

168
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,284
I even let them pick my drinks.

169
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,153
I just ate whatever she served,

170
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,155
so when I left, I barely
remembered what I'd had.

171
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,458
That's the privilege of being a regular.

172
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:14,761
Having simmered mackerel here
is a good memory for me.

173
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,205
Other than that,
I think it's be nice to just have

174
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,031
the owner's dishes served omakase-style,
as in, their recommendations.

175
00:08:20,131 --> 00:08:21,001
Right.

176
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:24,070
-We'll leave it to you.
-Okay.

177
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:25,672
Please pair it with alcohol.

178
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:26,906
Got it.

179
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:30,210
-He'll have to show off his skills today.
-Wow.

180
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,445
I will prepare the mackerel, then.

181
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:36,750
You learned how to cook it
a long time ago, right?

182
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:41,087
I did learn, but after
my mother passed away,

183
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:44,257
I had to go through
a lot of trial and error,

184
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:46,860
working really hard
to recreate a similar taste.

185
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,262
It's the first time I'm serving him.

186
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,432
-The first time?
-Yes.

187
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,834
Then you should… How should I put this?

188
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:55,969
-I should…
-Judge?

189
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:56,903
Of course.

190
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,705
Today, we'll see
if he has truly inherited…

191
00:08:58,772 --> 00:08:59,873
-Yes.
-…his mother's flavor.

192
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,641
I'm excited.

193
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,909
It's a good time to check.

194
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:04,711
That is a lot of pressure.

195
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,624
-Excuse me.
-Thank you.

196
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,393
Thank you.

197
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,595
Oh, I'm getting something.

198
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:28,635
SIMMERED MACKEREL 9,500 WON, 950 YEN

199
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,704
SOY SAUCE ADDED TO MOTHER'S SEASONING
AND SIMMERED FOR THREE DAYS

200
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,640
FOR A DEEP, SWEET-AND-SALTY FLAVOR

201
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,575
It's called Jukkoku.

202
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:36,676
JUKKOKU

203
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,012
CARRIES A GENTLE FRUIT AROMA
OF GREEN APPLES OR PEARS,

204
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,314
WITH SWEETNESS, ACIDITY, UMAMI,
AND ASTRINGENCY

205
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,850
COURSE 1, SIMMERED MACKEREL

206
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:47,187
THE UMAMI AND SALTINESS OF
THE BRAISED MACKEREL

207
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,390
ARE NEATLY AND ELEGANTLY
ROUNDED OUT BY THE DRINK

208
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:54,527
-Like God's tears.
-That is a good expression.

209
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,669
This is just so good.

210
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,304
Amazing.

211
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,608
Even just looking at it,
I can tell it's good.

212
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:11,311
I think it'll go well with sake.

213
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,615
-Try it.
-You go ahead.

214
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,283
-Then I'll have some.
-This…

215
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,688
This is like a trial…
Or rather, an evaluation, isn't it?

216
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:22,922
Yes.

217
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:38,271
It tastes the same.

218
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:40,206
-Thank you.
-It's exactly the same.

219
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,544
This is what Mr. Matsushige had
all the time, all those years.

220
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,779
It's good.

221
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:49,015
It's good.

222
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,785
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

223
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:55,889
I'm glad I got to have
the simmered mackerel again.

224
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,824
It's like your mother is alive.

225
00:10:57,891 --> 00:10:58,958
I'm glad.

226
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,260
Good job.

227
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,195
Nice.

228
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:05,131
The taste of the shop
you've cherished for so long.

229
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:07,233
Losing her was hard enough,

230
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,303
but never being able to
eat that mackerel again…

231
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:15,275
-That's a loss in life, too.
-It is sad.

232
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,168
How is it with the sake?

233
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:43,770
It is insane.

234
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,638
-It's insane.
-It is?

235
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,573
-It's insane.
-I see.

236
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,108
It's fine if you get drunk today.
You can lie down over there.

237
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:54,080
This is like Korean dried yellow croaker.

238
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,949
This salty flavor…

239
00:11:56,015 --> 00:12:00,687
I don't think it comes just from salt.

240
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,191
Because of the umami,

241
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:09,195
even after finishing it all,
my mouth keeps watering.

242
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:13,132
So you have to eat rice or drink sake.

243
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,635
But it's a pleasant intensity.

244
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:20,039
Even after drinking, the umami lingers,

245
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:23,610
and while chatting, you can still savor
the sweetness and depth.

246
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:28,648
You can even savor your own breath
as if it were a side dish to the drink.

247
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:34,687
You should try
Korean simmered mackerel next time.

248
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,789
-Korean simmered mackerel is famous too.
-I see.

249
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,524
-This…
-What's the sauce?

250
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,159
It feels like this

251
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:44,097
but with a bit of Cheongyang chili.

252
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,932
Maybe some chili powder, too.

253
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,934
There's radish served with it as well,

254
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:51,271
but this one's more strongly seasoned.

255
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,773
But this…

256
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:58,645
Maybe it's because I heard
the whole story before eating,

257
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,813
-but it tastes incredible.
-It is good.

258
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,349
I have never met his mother before,

259
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,052
but it's like she's here.

260
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:10,156
It's like she's at the counter.

261
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,562
It's good.

262
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,997
I'm craving rice.

263
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,833
-Would you like a little rice?
-Yes.

264
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:22,935
Rice…

265
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:24,437
Well…

266
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,507
This is little?

267
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,309
Thank you.

268
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,777
It comes with it.

269
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:39,652
I don't want to take a big bite.
I want to savor it.

270
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:45,024
This is totally off topic,

271
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:47,794
but this non-alcoholic beer
is really good.

272
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,129
Maybe it's just in your head.

273
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:53,266
-This is just non-alcoholic beer, right?
-Yes, it's what we normally sell.

274
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,668
Maybe they mixed some regular beer.

275
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:58,404
-Really?
-No, I wouldn't.

276
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:01,174
-It's good.
-Am I just imagining that it tastes good?

277
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:10,149
-Without rice…
-This is good. One more, please.

278
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,617
You're drinking too much.

279
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,986
I'm going to get drunk.

280
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:18,157
I'm going to sleep here.

281
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,426
I just remembered.

282
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:25,031
I quit drinking about seven years ago.

283
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:26,933
The last drink I had was at this place.

284
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,534
Seven years ago?

285
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,172
Yes, now that I think about it.

286
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,108
How much did you drink?

287
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,343
How much did you drink
at your retirement match?

288
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,780
I only remember drinking sake.

289
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:45,618
I remember it was then
when I decided to stop drinking.

290
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:47,787
Because you drank too much?

291
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:50,690
I started to get hangovers.

292
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:53,226
-Sake does cause hangovers.
-Yes.

293
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,995
But isn't that amazing, too?

294
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:59,098
To just say one day, "I'm quitting,"
and actually quit.

295
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:02,034
That takes strong willpower.
Something not everyone can do.

296
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,670
Maybe that day will come for you, too.

297
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,472
I don't want to quit.

298
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:08,107
You never know.

299
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:11,177
You don't know when it'll happen to you.

300
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,379
Please don't make me quit.

301
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:15,047
-I'm still young.
-I mean…

302
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,917
You can drink all you want now
so hurry up and have some Jukkoku.

303
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:22,155
Let's move onto the next dish and drink.

304
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,358
This is a beef tendon mapo dish.

305
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:33,299
MAPO-STYLE BRAISED BEEF TENDON
AND CAMEMBERT CHEESE

306
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:34,867
19,800 WON, 1,980 YEN

307
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,738
I simmered the beef tendon
in the vegetable soup you had earlier,

308
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,139
then added cheese to it.

309
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:43,075
I simmered it down with bonito broth.

310
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:46,012
-It looks good.
-Bonito…

311
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,283
A BROTH MADE WITH BONITO STOCK
AND VEGETABLE JUICE,

312
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:53,252
WITH MAPO-STYLE SPICES
GIVING IT A GENTLE, MELLOW SPICINESS

313
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:56,722
JAPANESE WINE

314
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,159
A SMOOTH FLAVOR THAT BLENDS
DELICATE FRUIT NOTES WITH

315
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:02,128
JUST THE RIGHT TOUCH OF ACIDITY

316
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,997
COURSE 2, BRAISED BEEF TENDON
AND CAMEMBERT CHEESE

317
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,333
WITH ITS SUBTLE FRUIT AROMA,
AND GRACEFUL ACIDITY,

318
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,469
THE WINE ENVELOPS
THE DISTINCTIVE INGREDIENTS

319
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,705
-Amazing.
-Did he invent this?

320
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:14,974
-It's a dish I'm working on.
-Can you eat it all?

321
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:24,350
It's good.

322
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,352
-It's that good?
-Yes.

323
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:29,322
Beef tendon…

324
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:38,731
-It's good.
-It's really good.

325
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:42,201
I get why you said their broth is good.

326
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,371
It tastes like galbijjim.

327
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,040
Korean braised short ribs.

328
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,543
If you made galbijjim a bit lighter

329
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,778
and added camembert cheese,
I think it would taste great.

330
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,647
This is a wonderful idea.

331
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:06,759
The cheese goes really well with this.

332
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:11,030
I never expected camembert
and braised beef tendon

333
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:13,866
-to go together so well.
-What was your inspiration for this?

334
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:17,436
I tried to make it so that it would
go well with wine or sake.

335
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:18,571
I see.

336
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:20,573
-Japanese wine?
-Yes.

337
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,677
What do you think?

338
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:29,749
-It goes well with the dish.
-I see.

339
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:32,919
-Oh, dear.
-What is it?

340
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:36,455
-What time do we start shooting tomorrow?
-Forget it. Don't think about that.

341
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:37,557
Should we skip it?

342
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:40,860
Today at the Kamo River…

343
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:42,862
I had Chinese food by myself
at the beginning, too.

344
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,864
It's fine. I'll film by myself tomorrow.

345
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,546
-This is insane.
-The umami?

346
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:02,715
I love drinking while I eat rice.

347
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:06,519
I love drinking with rice.

348
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:09,455
But it's the worst.
It makes you get really fat.

349
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,792
It's a party of carbs.

350
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:15,261
-This is dangerous.
-Pardon…

351
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,797
I'm adding rice to it.

352
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,439
It's really good.

353
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,178
-It's really good.
-It's really good.

354
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,680
Thank you.

355
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,219
This is really good.

356
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,721
-Right?
-Yes.

357
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,825
I think I'm going to end up
ordering more rice.

358
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,728
Once you order the full course of drinks
and even get a rice refill…

359
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,163
-I can't…
-…there's no turning back.

360
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,932
I'd be a pig.

361
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:56,636
As I thought, a thin body

362
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,538
just doesn't seem to suit me.

363
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:05,011
Normally, when I eat lunch like this,

364
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,278
I work out afterward.

365
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,214
You were born this way.

366
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,250
-Mr. Matjjigae doesn't gain weight easily.
-No wonder.

367
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:14,387
I gain weight just by breathing.

368
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,722
I have to work out.

369
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,624
It seems like you have lost some weight

370
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:19,925
-while we were apart.
-Yes.

371
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,562
I think you've already gained
more weight since this morning.

372
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,131
Oh, my.

373
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:27,900
Your cheeks are puffy.

374
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,805
It's dangerous.
Your cheeks are puffy already.

375
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:33,939
Puffy…

376
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,544
But it doesn't matter today.

377
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,081
It's so good.

378
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,116
This place is so good.

379
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,086
I should make a lighter galbijjim
and add camembert to it.

380
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:49,488
The cheese goes really well with this.

381
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,160
Amazing.

382
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:55,895
It would go really well with a baguette.

383
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,029
That's a good choice.

384
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,870
I'm not finished yet.

385
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,772
Please don't touch it.

386
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,307
I will protect it with my life.

387
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,875
You are.

388
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,080
It's good.

389
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,883
It seems like Kyoto is a place
where everything you eat

390
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,019
is above average quality.

391
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:21,987
This is a place where even by
Japanese standards,

392
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,223
-the average level is very high.
-Right.

393
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,860
-It is expensive.
-There are many Michelin-starred places.

394
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:31,564
Since there are people
making fair judgments about it,

395
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,400
places that don't taste good
end up fading away.

396
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:38,938
A restaurant can’t survive
unless it’s truly delicious.

397
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,072
Right.

398
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:42,441
As long as the flavor is solid,

399
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,844
-that alone is enough to keep it going.
-Yes.

400
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,046
The shop will keep going.

401
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:57,857
You know, I like it
during the winter here.

402
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:02,228
When filming a period drama,

403
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,196
you can't wear warm clothes
even in winter.

404
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,032
After a full day of shooting,
when my body was completely frozen,

405
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:11,070
-and I couldn't…
-Endure it?

406
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:15,040
I'd take off my wig, jump in a taxi,
and rush here.

407
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,143
I'd say, "Something warm, please,"

408
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:20,146
and she'd bring out the simmered mackerel.

409
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,881
And there's steam?

410
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,949
That's how I'd warm myself up.

411
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:26,819
It's that kind of place.

412
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:30,389
This place is the best.

413
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,657
Thank you.

414
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:34,794
It made me feel happy
the moment I stepped in here.

415
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,264
There's still more food left, right?

416
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,765
Next is sashimi.

417
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,836
-Sashimi from now on?
-Sashimi at this point in the meal…

418
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:48,374
-How confident is he?
-I don't know what sashimi it'll be.

419
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,044
It might not be an ordinary sashimi.

420
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,780
-Oh, I'm in trouble.
-What is this?

421
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:56,749
There are two kinds.

422
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:03,656
TWO KINDS OF SASHIMI ASSORTMENT
11,250 WON, 1,125 YEN

423
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:06,859
This is greater amberjack
and sweet sea bream

424
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:08,460
from Setouchi, aged for five days.

425
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,296
GREATER AMBERJACK, SWEET SEA BREAM

426
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:14,433
USING RYOSEN'S UNIQUE AGING METHOD,
THE UMAMI IS SLOWLY DRAWN OUT,

427
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,136
CHARACTERIZED BY A NATURAL SWEETNESS
AND DELICATE AROMA

428
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,839
SOKU
A SWEET AND SMOOTH FINISH

429
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:22,308
BALANCED WITH A RICH, ELEGANT AROMA

430
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,377
COURSE 3, TWO KINDS OF SASHIMI ASSORTMENT

431
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:30,082
THE FISH'S NATURAL SWEETNESS BLENDS
WITH THE REFRESHING CRISPNESS OF THE SAKE

432
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:32,117
Which one should we eat first?

433
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:33,452
The sweet sea bream.

434
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:36,021
-Sweet sea bream.
-Yes.

435
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,804
-It's…
-It hit the spot.

436
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:29,408
Even the smallest drop of that,
0.0001ml is enough

437
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:32,211
Have this and try at least a single drop.

438
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:34,647
This completes it.

439
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:51,897
The amberjack is delicious, too.

440
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:54,833
How can the richness of the oil

441
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:59,438
and the sweetness of the fish
be spread throughout the flesh like that?

442
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:01,941
-It doesn't separate.
-Right.

443
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:04,176
It's well-blended.

444
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:08,914
By aging it,
the hidden oils are drawn out.

445
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:13,052
It's all about timing and the result
of the 20 years this shop has built up.

446
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,353
It's amazing.

447
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,088
And the more you chew,

448
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:20,893
the umami spreads wide,
filling your whole mouth.

449
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,996
And the flavor shifts
from the first bite to the last.

450
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:27,666
-This is a dangerous shop.
-It is.

451
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,636
Is this tamari soy sauce?

452
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:32,671
It looks like oyster.

453
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:35,207
It's sticky.

454
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:38,243
It was aged for a year with root kelp.

455
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,578
-In the soy sauce?
-Yes.

456
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,814
Then we simmered it down.

457
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:43,282
It's good.

458
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:47,252
My grandmother lived in Nagasaki, Kyushu,

459
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,288
and whenever I visited her house,

460
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:53,659
there was always a light soy sauce
with kelp on the table.

461
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:55,461
-Sounds delicious.
-Well…

462
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:59,031
Whatever you ate with that soy sauce,
it always brought out the umami.

463
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:02,534
-Kelp is full of umami.
-I love umami.

464
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,036
I love umami.

465
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,811
An adult's version of Calpis.

466
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:16,015
This feels like the sweetness
has been intensely amplified.

467
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:17,716
That's why it tastes so clean.

468
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:20,686
The fish oil isn't fishy,
but it feels like

469
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:23,355
it all gets completely burned off.

470
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,692
-It suits them well.
-It does.

471
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:30,629
I'm already looking forward
to getting tipsy at the end,

472
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:34,500
adding some rice,
and mixing it all in here to eat.

473
00:25:35,234 --> 00:25:36,969
-After letting it soak.
-Yes.

474
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,071
I'm going to stop you.

475
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:40,773
Tomorrow morning, I'll…

476
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,408
-Will you be okay?
-Yes.

477
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:45,911
It's so good. So delicious.

478
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:47,212
Thank you, Mr. Matjjigae.

479
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,581
There's no need to thank me.

480
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:52,718
For introducing me to such a precious…

481
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:53,919
-It is precious.
-Yes.

482
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:55,854
I didn't want to tell anyone.

483
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:59,391
In the past, when we actors
came to Kyoto for filming,

484
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:02,261
we had to book our own accomodation.

485
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,163
-Back then--
-They didn't pay for accomodation?

486
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,198
Not all of it, no.

487
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:10,436
So the longer the shoot went on, the more
we had to cover the costs ourselves.

488
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:13,138
Things might've changed now.

489
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:15,340
But it was like that not too long ago.

490
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:19,478
So whenever I came to Kyoto,
I was already mentally exhausted.

491
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:23,882
In the end, I even had to make do
with convenience store meals.

492
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:28,320
-That's when you came here.
-Yes, to his mother's shop.

493
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:32,291
I had lunch and dinner
at his mother's place.

494
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:36,562
We would chat while I had dinner
and then I'd go back.

495
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:40,132
That was my only happiness back then.

496
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,801
I see.

497
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:44,603
It's really good.

498
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:48,140
Can we order one more? Does he have any…

499
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:49,475
-Do you have something?
-I do.

500
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:50,509
-You do?
-A special menu.

501
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:52,111
-Special?
-We have to try it.

502
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:54,346
Special to me? What is it?

503
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:55,414
What could it be?

504
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:57,516
Homemade cheese.

505
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:59,818
-Homemade cheese?
-You make cheese?

506
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:05,324
It's rather small.

507
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,725
How cute.

508
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:13,499
RYOSEN CHEESE 11,000 WON, 1,100 YEN
(ONLY WHEN YOU ORDER A COURSE MENU)

509
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:16,668
MIXING FERMENTED FISH WITH CREAM CHEESE

510
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:19,605
CREATES A DEEP FLAVOR AND RICH UMAMI

511
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:21,840
ISHIKAWA PREFECTURE'S SOGEN

512
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:25,043
IT CARRIES THE PROFOUND UMAMI
OF RICE WITH A SUBTLE SWEETNESS

513
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:26,979
SPECIAL COURSE, RYOSEN CHEESE

514
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:29,381
THE CHEESE AND THE AROMA
OF THE SAKE SPREAD TOGETHER,

515
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:30,749
CREATING AN ENTIRELY NEW TASTE

516
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:35,487
-I ferment the leftover parts of the fish…
-Leftover parts?

517
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:38,590
I salted the bones and innards,

518
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:42,661
kneaded them into a paste, and aged it
in the fridge for half a year.

519
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:46,298
-He's quite the culinary researcher.
-It is insane.

520
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:47,866
Hold on.

521
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:51,003
It doesn't even smell like fish.

522
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:53,038
And to make it into a cheese…

523
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:54,973
-I mix cream cheese.
-You mix it.

524
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:59,545
-At the same temperature.
-If someone asks where the umami's from…

525
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:01,246
It's the fish.

526
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:09,321
What do you think? Would you like a drink?

527
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,597
It calls for a drink, right?

528
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,660
Hurry up and order it.

529
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:16,161
-Alcohol…
-"Hurry up and order it."

530
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:18,330
-Order it.
-Next is alcohol.

531
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:33,178
Do you know shutō, made from bonito?

532
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:34,947
I do. I love it.

533
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:35,914
-It's intestines.
-Yes.

534
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:37,816
-And mascarpone cheese.
-Perfect with drinks.

535
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,852
-It goes well with drinks.
-It's really good.

536
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,554
This is like

537
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:47,326
the perfect Caesar salad dressing
to pair with alcohol.

538
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,995
The fishiness is hidden,

539
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:54,199
and the umami
is concentrated in the cheese.

540
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,302
This would be great with bread.

541
00:28:57,369 --> 00:29:01,440
-Bread would be good.
-Baguette toasted with butter.

542
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:04,142
-A crunchy bread would be nice.
-Yes.

543
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:06,812
And drinking white wine like this.

544
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,581
I think it'll be good like this, too.

545
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:12,150
Put it on rice, and…

546
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:18,690
It's good.

547
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,059
-Right?
-It's the best.

548
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:24,997
With rice, it's like a cold risotto.

549
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:28,700
You have that as a side
while drinking sake.

550
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:35,741
-It goes well with rice.
-It's so good.

551
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,142
It goes well with rice.

552
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:46,151
I'll try it like this.

553
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:48,520
Put some on top of the amberjack…

554
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:50,589
That looks so good.

555
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,266
The amberjack turned
into a different fish.

556
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:07,539
When things flow like this,

557
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:09,975
you usually end up wanting
to go for a second round.

558
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:12,978
Can I eat and drink a little more?

559
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:15,080
-Of course.
-This place is the best.

560
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:16,448
Have you had a lot already?

561
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:20,118
No. I can drink at least ten times more.

562
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,219
Amazing.

563
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:23,789
You are a great son.

564
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:27,726
-You are an amazing chef.
-You've become an amazing chef.

565
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,499
AFTER THE SHOOT

566
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:39,371
On three. One, two, three.

567
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:49,348
MOTHER, OWNER

568
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:50,649
KYOTO MOTHER'S SIMMERED MACKEREL

569
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:55,087
A STORY ABOUT THE LADY
WHO KNEW BETTER THAN ANYONE

570
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:57,689
HOW MUCH I LOVED THAT DISH

571
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:00,325
NEXT INSANELY GOOD SPOT

572
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:02,894
KYOTO IZAKAYA VS BUSAN HANGOVER SOUP

573
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,996
DRINKING IN KYOTO

574
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:06,732
SHAKING OFF A HANGOVER IN BUSAN

575
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,201
BUSAN HANGOVER SOUP
FRESHWATER MARSH CLAM SOUP

576
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,203
This soup works wonders.

577
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:14,873
I feel healed.

578
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:20,812
They serve simmered mackerel
as a side dish.

579
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,948
This is amazing.

580
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:39,197
