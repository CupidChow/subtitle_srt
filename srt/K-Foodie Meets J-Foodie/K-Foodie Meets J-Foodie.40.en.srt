1
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:05,271
K-foodie meets J-foodie.

2
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:06,840
This is insane.

3
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:08,942
SAPPORO TO ASAHIKAWA
2 HOURS AWAY

4
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:12,112
ASAHIKAWA
A SMALL CITY IN HOKKAIDO

5
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:14,881
-40°C
IN JAPAN'S COLDEST CITY

6
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:18,284
A STEAMING BOWL OF GINGER RAMEN

7
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:23,823
What are we having today?

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,093
Since visiting Hokkaido,
I've had all kinds of great food,

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,699
but among them,
this ramen shop in Asahikawa

10
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:35,802
is nothing special…

11
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,572
-Is it good?
-…but it draws you in.

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,107
I'm curious.

13
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:43,510
I keep craving it. Ginger on my mind.

14
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:45,045
-That much?
-Ginger on my mind.

15
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:46,279
I have ginger on my mind.

16
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:49,015
Cut it out. It's ginger ramen.

17
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,050
Ginger ramen!

18
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:51,451
-So that's why.
-Ginger on my mind.

19
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:53,887
-Ginger ramen.
-Ginger ramen.

20
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:56,289
-I love ginger.
-I see.

21
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:57,524
Do Koreans eat a lot of ginger?

22
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,861
Koreans tend to favor garlic.
Japanese are more into ginger.

23
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:04,030
Koreans do eat ginger,

24
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:06,533
but garlic is the main ingredient.

25
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:10,837
I can't forget the ginger ramen

26
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,639
here in Asahikawa.

27
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:13,740
-Really?
-Yes.

28
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,342
Mr. Matjjigae's spot.

29
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,078
-Mizuno.
-Mizuno.

30
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,914
I checked a bit.

31
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,184
Looks like they don't serve alcohol.

32
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,985
-That's a shame.
-I'll head back then.

33
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,221
Didn't you drink a lot yesterday?

34
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:29,422
Yes, but I'm fine.

35
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,858
In the morning,
when your stomach feels rough,

36
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,195
you should warm it back up with ginger.

37
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,496
True.

38
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,131
-Then let's go in.
-Let's.

39
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,367
-Excuse us.
-Excuse us.

40
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:48,241
GINGER RAMEN INSANELY GOOD SPOT
MIZUNO

41
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,779
COZY SPACE

42
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:56,249
WALLS FULL OF AUTOGRAPHS

43
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,084
MR. MATJJIGAE'S AUTOGRAPH

44
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,119
Welcome.

45
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:00,820
-Nice vibe.
-Long time no see.

46
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:01,888
Thanks for having us.

47
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,456
-Welcome.
-Thanks for having us.

48
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:09,462
GINGER RAMEN ON THE MIND

49
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,568
Amazing.

50
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,103
Ginger ramen.

51
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,806
Ginger Ramen. That sign doesn't lie.

52
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,508
It doesn't lie.

53
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:23,042
GINGER RAMEN

54
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:26,079
If you think about it, Mr. Matjjigae,

55
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:31,050
you've got Kyushu tonkotsu in your veins.

56
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:32,018
Right.

57
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:35,655
As a kid I mostly ate tonkotsu ramen.

58
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:39,225
After I moved to Tokyo,

59
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,661
lots of good regional ramen started

60
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,796
-showing up in Tokyo.
-Gathering there.

61
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:47,400
Now I can pick whatever I want.
It's a golden age.

62
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,670
There's shio ramen and miso ramen,

63
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,539
-and iekei ramen.
-Right.

64
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,807
There are lots of lineages,

65
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:57,544
such as jiro-kei ramen and more.

66
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,413
You can eat whichever you like.

67
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,782
But among them,

68
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,418
the one that made me think, "This is new,"

69
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,453
was this ginger ramen.

70
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,454
So,

71
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:12,559
even a ramen fanatic

72
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:17,797
will think, "Why didn't
a place like this exist before?"

73
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:21,234
Pros come to this ramen shop.

74
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,236
-Now I'm excited.
-Exactly.

75
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:24,771
Shall we order?

76
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,206
Excuse me, may we order?

77
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,640
What should I get?

78
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,676
Ginger ramen is number one for me.

79
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,111
Hello, long time no see.

80
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,280
How have you been?

81
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,315
Thanks for having us.

82
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:40,520
I've been well, thanks to you.
I'm here for ginger ramen.

83
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,255
Thank you.

84
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,923
How long have you been open?

85
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,658
About 50 years.

86
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,327
-About 50 years.
-Yes.

87
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,662
Was the previous owner
your husband's father?

88
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,831
Yes, he was my father-in-law.

89
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:57,237
Ginger ramen back then. Great idea.

90
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:03,309
When my father-in-law ate sashimi,

91
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:07,146
he preferred ginger over wasabi…

92
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:10,550
-Even on sashimi?
-…and that was the reason.

93
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:11,784
So I heard.

94
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:14,954
Ginger ramen is a must.

95
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:18,057
GINGER RAMEN, 700 YEN

96
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,093
You can add chashu.

97
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:22,395
CHASHU + GINGER RAMEN

98
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,597
I'll have ginger ramen with chashu.

99
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:25,965
Very well.

100
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,735
-I'll have the regular ginger ramen.
-Regular ginger ramen.

101
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,737
-Thank you.
-I'll get started.

102
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,941
Even for someone who's tried

103
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:39,312
a lot of various ramen,

104
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,982
the ramen here feels special.

105
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,984
I didn't expect that much praise.

106
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,221
-If it's bad, I'll say so.
-Of course.

107
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,590
The day after drinking,

108
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,992
a bowl of ginger ramen from here

109
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:56,462
really settles me.

110
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:57,897
So that's ten years ago.

111
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,300
-Back when I drank.
-Back then, yes.

112
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:05,872
When I came to Asahikawa ten years ago

113
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,907
to shoot The Solitary Gourmet,

114
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,978
although this place wasn't on the show,

115
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:17,116
I was hooked once I was brought here.

116
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,621
Didn't you say Koreans
don't eat much ginger?

117
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,656
We do,

118
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,893
but it's not the main character.

119
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,729
Japan has shogayaki, don't they?

120
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:33,866
SHOGAYAKI (GINGER STIR-FRY)
HOME-STYLE PORK IN GINGER-SOY

121
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:36,169
Pork shogayaki…

122
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,970
-That's a Japanese staple.
-…is something my mother makes often.

123
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:41,307
In Korea, instead of ginger,
garlic is the main character.

124
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:46,145
If we add ginger,
it's a third or a quarter of the garlic

125
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:48,314
mostly to neutralize off-odors.

126
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,416
It's not the protagonist.

127
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:54,020
But this ginger ramen flips that idea.

128
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:55,922
I wonder.

129
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:02,195
It's kind of…

130
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,298
cool, I guess?

131
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,466
Solo dining?

132
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,836
Time for yourself, by yourself.

133
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:13,172
You spend it entirely on you.

134
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,476
You come for the food
with no interruptions.

135
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,477
True.

136
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,313
Enjoying food
without worrying about others…

137
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,617
Thank you.

138
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,854
Are you from around here, sir?

139
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:29,989
-From Fukuoka.
-Fukuoka?

140
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,057
He's from Fukuoka too.

141
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,358
Did you come just for this?

142
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,459
Yes.

143
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,695
-It's been 30 years.
-30 years?

144
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:40,099
Did you just happen to stop by
30 years ago?

145
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,267
I looked it up and came.

146
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,303
There was no internet back then.

147
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,972
-Right.
-I came by magazine.

148
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,642
-Fukuoka has tons of ramen.
-There are all kinds.

149
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:53,780
It's the home of Kurume ramen.

150
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,350
This ginger ramen stands out, doesn't it?

151
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:01,487
I've eaten a lot of ramen in Fukuoka too,

152
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:06,559
but this has a distinctive soy-sauce note.

153
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:07,527
Right.

154
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,396
-It's clean.
-Clean, you say?

155
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:14,434
Unlike tonkotsu, it's quite clean.

156
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,304
-Even so, it hooks you.
-And it has umami.

157
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,542
All set?

158
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,443
Here you are.

159
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,778
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you so much.

160
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:27,880
Regular ginger ramen.

161
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,115
Thank you.

162
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,651
I'm happy.

163
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:36,589
GINGER RAMEN
700 YEN / 7,000 WON

164
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:38,858
-Chashu ginger ramen.
-Thank you.

165
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,127
Lots of chashu.

166
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:46,666
CHASHU GINGER RAMEN
1,000 YEN / 10,000 WON

167
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,935
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

168
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:49,836
Have a good trip.

169
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,604
Give me a happy face.

170
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:53,973
Okay.

171
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:55,475
Thank you.

172
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,577
Thank you for the food.

173
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:01,047
Thank you.

174
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:17,864
Tasty.

175
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,534
-Already?
-It's so good.

176
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,102
I got it already.

177
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,237
You got it?

178
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:28,741
Soy sauce and ginger are a classic pair.

179
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:29,642
They are.

180
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:34,180
Anyone ever have soy sauce, ginger,
miso stir-fry before? Shogayaki?

181
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,481
It feels similar.

182
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:36,616
Soy sauce,

183
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:38,451
pork fat,

184
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:40,653
and ginger.

185
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,155
BROTH WITH THE REFRESHING AROMA OF GINGER

186
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:45,691
It has a bright, fresh feel.

187
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,663
It's a good broth.

188
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,536
Almost like a concentrated ginger extract.

189
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,504
There's quite a lot of ginger in it.

190
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:06,979
Honestly, ginger might be
more versatile than garlic.

191
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:14,153
It's pretty spicy when eaten raw,

192
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,455
but the heat makes it mild.

193
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,098
It's so good.

194
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,975
Truly, it's a legit,

195
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:39,478
delicious soy-sauce ramen

196
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:44,150
with ginger waiting underneath.

197
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,724
Another thing I really like is

198
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,392
the finely chopped menma.

199
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,429
So that was menma.

200
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:00,967
MENMA
FERMENTED BAMBOO SHOOTS, DRIED OR SALTED

201
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:06,272
Ginger doesn't push forward
and it doesn't have a strong presence.

202
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:10,042
So something soft like menma
fits as a topping.

203
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:15,581
The noodles are thin, so it isn't heavy.

204
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,997
I want to recommend ginger ramen

205
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,533
to Koreans diners

206
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,671
and to people new to Japanese ramen.

207
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:40,973
What's a good catchphrase?

208
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,377
When you first try Japanese ramen,

209
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:47,713
you think it's tasty, then go,
"Wow, it's salty," or "Wow, it's rich."

210
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,917
But Koreans tend to drink the broth.

211
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,153
Since we're a broth culture.

212
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:58,624
But ginger ramen has a broth
that's healthy for you.

213
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:01,761
-It's light.
-You can drink it as much as you want.

214
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,265
You end up finishing it.

215
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:10,302
Now I get why you called it clean.

216
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:13,773
It goes down easy.

217
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:17,643
Tonkotsu is great,

218
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,112
but you feel guilty
if you drink the broth.

219
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,982
"It's good, but what will
happen tomorrow?"

220
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:28,187
So you eat the noodles
and leave the broth.

221
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,823
But with ginger ramen,
I could eat it with rice.

222
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:31,757
Right.

223
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:37,697
We're drawn to broth

224
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,499
all around the world.

225
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,402
Both in the West and Korea.

226
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,139
Since people want to finish the broth,

227
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,809
some intentionally make it mild.

228
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:54,580
For Japanese diners,
noodle is first in ramen.

229
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:59,185
-Many leave the broth.
-So the seasoning is strong.

230
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:01,487
With ginger ramen,

231
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,856
I tell people to drink even the broth.

232
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:07,993
The world of ramen really is deep.

233
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,165
For Japanese people,

234
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,468
ramen is practically a national dish.

235
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:20,840
In Japan, there is no town
without a ramen shop.

236
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:25,144
Among local ramen, this ginger ramen

237
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,747
feels one of a kind.

238
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,615
-Is it in Tokyo?
-No.

239
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:36,756
I've seen a similar katsuo ramen.

240
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:38,124
I've tried it too.

241
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:43,529
But it can't match the refinement here.

242
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:53,906
The ginger's role here feels excellent.

243
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,908
Just right.

244
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,278
Neither too much nor too little.

245
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:02,882
It's been a while
since I had guilt-free ramen.

246
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:07,219
It actually feels good for my health.

247
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,321
One of the actresses even carries

248
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,792
a tube of minced ginger all the time

249
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,095
and sprinkles it on everything.

250
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,464
-Really?
-I knew someone who did.

251
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,299
Because ginger is good for you.

252
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,868
-On bentos, anywhere.
-A magic sauce.

253
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,604
She'd sprinkle minced ginger
on Hamburg steaks or whatnot.

254
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,107
You might think, "Why?"

255
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:31,710
Still, it's good for you.

256
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,748
In summer, ginger helps your body
cool down moderately.

257
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,716
In winter, it helps you warm you up.

258
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,486
GINGER PROMOTES DIGESTION,
IMPROVES CIRCULATION, BOOSTS IMMUNITY

259
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,321
CARDIOVASCULAR & ORAL HEALTH,
AND RELIEVES MUSCLE PAIN

260
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:45,791
A hot ginger broth is perfect in winter.

261
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,827
Here in winter, it's full of snow.

262
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:52,498
WINTER IN ASAHIKAWA

263
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:55,568
To get here,
it's a bit far from the station.

264
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,671
So you have to take a taxi,
or walk through the snow.

265
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:04,577
Then you have ginger ramen

266
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:07,213
and warm up from the inside.

267
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:41,280
The noodle thickness
and texture are just right,

268
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:45,551
and before you know it, it is finished.

269
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:52,791
Delicious.

270
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,061
It's really nice.

271
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:57,763
This ginger ramen is excellent.

272
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:03,068
Only if I had a properly ice-cold…

273
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:05,871
draft beer.

274
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,840
A bottled beer would do too.

275
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:12,344
Drink the warm broth,

276
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:17,182
then have a cold beer.
It's like a beer after a bath.

277
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,250
Like a post-bath beer.

278
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:22,454
Maybe that's the only flaw?

279
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:23,455
A flaw?

280
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,259
Why don't you sell beer?

281
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,394
None at all?

282
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,429
Beer, you say…

283
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,533
People bring kids,

284
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,669
and there are students.

285
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:41,006
So the founder told me
not to sell alcohol.

286
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:43,943
Fair enough.

287
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,044
Huh?

288
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,046
You're open from morning?

289
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,847
-From 11 a.m.
-I see.

290
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,215
What are your hours?

291
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,817
Until lunch at 2 p.m.

292
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,386
-Until 2 p.m.?
-So three hours.

293
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,122
Well, that's unfortunate.

294
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,192
-It's unbelievably good.
-Thank you.

295
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,393
I'm Korean,

296
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,596
and this is my first ginger ramen.

297
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:08,067
On TV, they often say Koreans
have good skin

298
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:11,170
because they eat spicy food…

299
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:13,005
I've heard of that before.

300
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:18,177
So I thought it might be under-seasoned.
Was it okay?

301
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:21,280
Korean food is milder than you think.

302
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:22,581
I see.

303
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,184
So this will suit Korean tastes better.

304
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,218
Is that so?

305
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,556
Rather than having heavy seasoning,

306
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:34,860
Korean dishes often
let the ginger come through.

307
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,696
But this one isn't polarizing.

308
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,199
It's a flavor everyone likes.

309
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,401
Thank you.

310
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,771
Have you decided who'll take over?

311
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,375
We'll likely close with our generation.

312
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,243
-Is this the end?
-Really?

313
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,312
Because there's no successor.

314
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:56,081
With this ginger ramen,

315
00:16:57,082 --> 00:17:00,152
haven't many asked to be your apprentice?

316
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,688
No one yet.

317
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:03,589
Really?

318
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:08,560
So leaving gracefully is best.

319
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,463
You mean…

320
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,600
It's better to stop
while people still miss it.

321
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:20,506
For anyone who's had it,
the taste will linger in their memory.

322
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:21,540
Do you think so?

323
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:28,414
If someone in Fukuoka
still wants it after 30 years,

324
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,582
I don't think that's a lie.

325
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,052
Mizuno.

326
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:34,319
Ginger Ramen, Mizuno.

327
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:38,357
Now I suddenly feel sad.

328
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,994
I just found it,
and I'll never eat it again.

329
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,798
I said you'd want to come back.

330
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:48,567
It's impossible,
but I want to make it at home.

331
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,703
Right, I want to copy it at home.

332
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,139
Could you give us even one hint?

333
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,442
Even for Mr. Matsushige,
I'm afraid I can't.

334
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,077
All right.

335
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:00,279
-Worth a try.
-Nice try.

336
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:01,180
Right?

337
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,081
Total failure.

338
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,315
A big failure.

339
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,951
Then we'll have to become apprentices.

340
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,353
How many years would that take?

341
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:12,257
If we worked really hard?

342
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:16,028
With our ramen, me included,

343
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:21,366
we'd be learning
right up until the day we shut the doors.

344
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,137
Right up to my last day.

345
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,073
That's wonderful.

346
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:33,245
But you look like you'll live very long.

347
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:34,980
We'd be in trouble if you didn't.

348
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,548
I think you'll live a long time.

349
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,851
I've lived long enough already.

350
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:39,785
No, no, no, no.

351
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,487
Could you live about 40 more years?

352
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,222
Please, I'm asking you.

353
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:45,224
I'd make the Guinness book.

354
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,795
-This ginger ramen is delicious.
-It was great.

355
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,563
Thank you for the meal!

356
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,799
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

357
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,968
-I'll do my best.
-Thank you.

358
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:58,403
-We'll come again.
-Please come as apprentices.

359
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,106
