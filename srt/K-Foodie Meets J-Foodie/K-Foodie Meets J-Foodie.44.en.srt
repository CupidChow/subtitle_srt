00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,238
I'm getting hungry.

BUSAN

00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,676
Let's find a good spot.

4
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:13,880
Please share
your secret neighborhood spots with us.

5
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:14,814
Is that really so?

FROM ASKING LOCALS

7
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:18,885
We heard it was good,
so we wanted to go. But we can't?

BUSAN TAXI DRIVERS' MUST-EAT SPOT

16
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:49,182
So, for today…

17
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:54,120
Remember how we went around Kyoto
looking for good spots to eat?

18
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:57,157
-Asking your friends is great, but…
-Right.

19
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:02,095
How is it in Japan? When you go
to a new area and hop in a cab,

20
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:08,301
do you ask the driver,
"Are there any good spots to eat nearby?"

21
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:09,402
We do sometimes.

22
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:14,240
Any place a taxi driver recommends
is usually a hidden gem

23
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:17,811
and a valuable tip in Japan too.

24
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:21,147
That's why I honestly
didn't look anything up.

25
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:22,749
There's a taxi rest stop here.

26
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:26,586
Let's go meet some taxi drivers
we never met before.

27
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,421
-Okay, I'm counting on you.
-Sure.

28
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,290
-Is this the rest stop?
-Yes.

29
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:32,125
-Hello!
-Hello.

30
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,060
Wow! Nice to meet you.

31
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:37,297
-Yes, hello.
-It's nice to meet you.

32
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,700
TAXI DRIVERS' REST AREA

33
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:46,840
A SPACE WHERE TAXI DRIVERS CAN TAKE
A SHORT BREAK OR USE THE RESTROOM

34
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:50,510
Thank you very much
for helping us out today.

35
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,178
Thank you for your help today.

36
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,746
My name is Sung Si-kyung.

37
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,915
Nice to meet you.

38
00:01:55,982 --> 00:02:00,453
I'm Yutaka Matsushige
from The Solitary Gourmet.

39
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,088
He's on the show, The Solitary Gourmet--

40
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,022
I saw him on TV.

41
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,357
He says he saw you on TV.

42
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:05,859
Thank you.

43
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:08,027
We're hungry.

44
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:09,562
We're hungry.

45
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:14,767
Please share
your secret neighborhood spots with us.

46
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:16,736
He wants to know
where the locals go to eat,

47
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:20,273
not the spots that Japanese tourists go.

48
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,543
And the local taxi drivers
usually know the best, right?

49
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,546
So we wanted to ask you for tips,
which is why we're here.

50
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,047
We have a fun idea.

51
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:30,517
Once we hear everyone's and pick a spot,

52
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,419
we'll ride the taxi
of the person who recommended it.

53
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,787
That's right.

54
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,055
Please take us there.

55
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,892
Please begin, sir.

56
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,029
I would say hairtail.

57
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,130
-Hairtail.
-Hairtail?

58
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,733
Grilled or braised.

59
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,067
He eats it grilled or braised.

60
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,738
Done in a way
so there's no strong fishy smell.

61
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:53,206
What is that place like?

62
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,175
Could you describe the place?

63
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,143
It opened a year and a half ago.

64
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,645
So it's a new place.

65
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:02,115
-Everything's very clean inside.
-It's very clean.

66
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,551
How many times have you been there?

67
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,052
I go there often.

68
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,721
-He goes there often.
-Because the food is delicious?

69
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,223
Yes.

70
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,759
-That's our first option.
-Personally, that's tempting.

71
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:14,827
It's tempting? Is it?

72
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,896
Busan has great hairtail.

73
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,031
Is that so?

74
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,933
Thank you very much. Next, please.

75
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,734
Kalguksu.

76
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,469
-Kalguksu!
-Kalguksu.

77
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,005
A place that makes kalguksu with seafood.

78
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,273
Sounds delicious.

79
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,342
They also have dolsot bibimbap
and many others.

80
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,511
-Dolsot bibimbap.
-Like in a hot stone pot?

81
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,279
Yes, they have hot stone pot bibimbap.

82
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,148
Do you go there often?

83
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,182
Yes.

84
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,584
-I see.
-Yes.

85
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,685
Thank you.

86
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,788
-Mine is chueotang.
-Ah, chueotang.

87
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:42,789
Chueotang? What's that?

88
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,857
-It's loach soup.
-Loach?

89
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:47,627
They only have one menu,
and it's chueotang.

90
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:48,795
They don't do fried loach?

91
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,597
Only chueotang.

92
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:52,165
They grind the loach, right?

93
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,666
Yes, completely ground up.

94
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,268
So it's not Namwon style.

95
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:58,104
In Korea, we grind the whole loach

96
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,773
with the bones and make it into a broth.

97
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,775
We also add Sichuan pepper.

98
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,477
So there's no loach meat in there?

99
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:08,281
All the meat is blended into the broth.

100
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:11,718
-It's good for your health.
-That's interesting.

101
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:16,322
-Just these three are making my head spin.
-His head is spinning with just three.

102
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:19,726
Can we hear the next one? Please, sir.

103
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,295
-I recommend samgyetang.
-Samgyetang.

104
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:25,064
It's considered a summer health food,

105
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:29,168
because it's made
with medicinal ingredients like angelica.

106
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:33,273
When you've been sweating and worn out,

107
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:37,176
having this brings your energy back.

108
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:40,346
That's why I eat it very often.

109
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,215
-I see. Thank you.
-Thank you.

110
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,385
My stomach is in bad shape
because of stomach cancer,

111
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,287
so I mostly eat at home.

112
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:50,890
He says his stomach isn't in great shape

113
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,159
-so he tends to eat at home.
-Okay.

114
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:57,297
But when I'm out with people,
I go for chueotang like that driver.

115
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:58,464
That really calms my stomach.

116
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,166
Are you talking about the same place?

117
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,335
He says it's the same spot
we heard just then,

118
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,938
and that he usually has chueotang
when he's out meeting people.

119
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,274
So that's two votes for chueotang.

120
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:09,842
-I see.
-All right. Thank you.

121
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,110
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

122
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,612
TAXI DRIVERS' RECOMMENDED MENUS

123
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,480
1. GRILLED & BRAISED HAIRTAIL
2. SEAFOOD KALGUKSU

124
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:19,319
3. CHUEOTANG
4. SAMGYETANG

125
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,690
This is tough.

126
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,091
Should we tour around?

127
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,127
Let's tour around like two places.

128
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,630
First, we have hairtail for a light meal,

129
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:34,634
then second, we go have kalguksu.

130
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,135
Very quickly.

131
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,738
So you're not picking samgyetang
this time?

132
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,106
Oh, samgyetang.

133
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,776
What does the chueotang look like?

134
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:46,746
It's like this.

135
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:54,053
They give you dolsot rice, chueotang,
and a lot of side dishes.

136
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,090
-Let's go for chueotang.
-Chueotang?

137
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:57,990
Chueotang.

138
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,293
-Let's go.
-Have you ever tried it?

139
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,427
No.

140
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,764
Let's go for chueotang.

141
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,566
I'll check if we can film there.

142
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,012
Hello, this is…

143
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:25,151
A premium taxi driver here
recommended me to your place.

144
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:30,189
You know that TV show
with the Japanese guy, right?

145
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,992
The one where Sung Si-kyung and the guy
go around restaurants?

146
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,228
Sorry?

147
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:36,462
I'm…

148
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:38,664
I'm the singer, Sung Si-kyung.

149
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:44,170
A taxi driver who's a regular there
introduced your place to us.

150
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,239
We heard it was good, so we wanted to go…

151
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,410
-We don't want to be featured like that.
-Is that so?

152
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,414
What is it?

153
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,550
They said they don't want to be filmed.

154
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:58,918
Refused to be filmed.

155
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:00,953
That's a shame.

156
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,289
-This happens a lot, actually.
-Right,

157
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:04,690
then let's go for hairtail.

158
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,627
-What?
-Wait, this is a fishing store.

159
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,429
So this place used to

160
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:12,365
run a fishing equipment store
on the first floor,

161
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,066
then they moved it to the second floor

162
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,769
and they're now running
a very clean hairtail restaurant.

163
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:23,075
I only saw a fishing equipment store there
so I asked about it.

164
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:24,877
He says they moved the store
to the second floor

165
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:30,183
and opened up a new restaurant
on the first floor.

166
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:32,452
-I'm a little scared.
-You're scared?

167
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:33,486
Would you be okay?

168
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:34,687
Let's go for hairtail.

169
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:35,988
You're taking the fall, right?

170
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,257
I'll own it. It's fine!

171
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,573
-Hello?
-Hello?

172
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,107
-Yes.
-Hello.

173
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:58,277
My name is Sung Si-kyung,
and I'm a singer.

174
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:03,616
I'm on a show with a Japanese guy
where we introduce Korean eateries.

175
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:05,218
Okay.

176
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:09,388
We tried this thing where we got
recommendations from taxi drivers,

177
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:10,723
and your place was mentioned.

178
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:12,191
Okay.

179
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,392
Are you open today?

180
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,194
Yes.

181
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,864
We have to film, though.
So if you're okay with it,

182
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,067
we'll have to bring
around 15 members of our crew.

183
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:24,837
We have enough space. When is the shoot?

184
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,939
If we go now,
we'll be there in 10 minutes.

185
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:34,113
-We can do that.
-Great! We'll be there.

186
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,983
-All right.
-Yes, thank you.

187
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,587
-Okay?
-Yes, we're okay.

188
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,222
Hairtail it is!

189
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,293
-Thank you.
-Yes.

190
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,729
We'll go to the chueotang place
another time.

191
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:50,763
Thank you.

192
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,032
We're counting on you, sir.

193
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,967
We appreciate your help.

194
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,670
Yes, thank you for the ride.

195
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,607
Sir, do you like fishing?

196
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,509
You must really like fishing.

197
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:06,512
I have my fishing rod
in the trunk right now.

198
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,614
He always has a fishing rod in the trunk.

199
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:11,217
-I'm jealous.
-He's jealous.

200
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,085
Do you fish at all, Mr. Matjjigae?

201
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,754
I used to. I loved it.

202
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,123
He says he used to go fishing
all the time.

203
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:18,658
Is that so?

204
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,227
I used to go fishing in Fukuoka
when I was a kid.

205
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,229
He's from Fukuoka,

206
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,631
so he fished since he was a kid
in Fukuoka.

207
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:29,702
I went after barley-patter mullet
at the beach.

208
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,471
He went after easy stuff
like barley-pattern mullet.

209
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,874
Barley-pattern mullet is fancy,

210
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,510
-and it's very good when you fry it.
-It's delicious.

211
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,380
How did you find this new restaurant?

212
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:43,282
You know how they sell fishing equipment?

213
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,419
-I went there to buy some.
-He went to buy equipment.

214
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:51,290
He knows the place very well because
it began as a fishing tackle shop.

215
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:52,625
Oh, I see.

216
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,126
Brought together by fishing.

217
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,995
-You were connected through fishing.
-Yes.

218
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,297
-That one?
-"Daeshin Fishing."

219
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,299
-"Galchi Hoegwan."
-Yes.

220
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,168
A fish restaurant that started out

221
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:07,673
-as a tackle shop.
-It sounds credible.

222
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,443
-Wow, it really is a tackle shop.
-We're here.

223
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,512
This place might turn out to be a jackpot.

224
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:15,581
I told you so.

225
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:18,284
-You never know what's going to happen.
-We're lucky today.

226
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,752
This is what makes it fun.

227
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,687
We had to come to this place
because we got

228
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:24,557
-rejected by the chueotang place.
-Yes, we did.

229
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,325
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

230
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,862
THE SPOT RECOMMENDED
BY A BUSAN TAXI DRIVER OF 32 YEARS

231
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,432
FRESH-CAUGHT HAIRTAIL SPECIALIST
GALCHI HOEGWAN

232
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,201
I'm already…

233
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,136
-This is hairtail.
-This?

234
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:40,139
I've never tried fresh-caught hairtail.

235
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:41,440
This is yellowtail.

236
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:44,510
-Amberjack or yellowtail.
-One or the other.

237
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:46,479
Is that a shark?

238
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:47,413
That's a shark.

239
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,383
Is that the tackle shop?

240
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:53,019
They moved the tackle shop
to the second floor

241
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,121
and opened the restaurant
on the first floor.

242
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:58,024
-Hello.
-Hello.

243
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,058
Hello.

244
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,126
Nice to meet you.

245
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,995
This is Yutaka Matsushige.

246
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,997
-Thank you for having us.
-He's a Japanese actor.

247
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,199
Thank you for having us
on such short notice.

248
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:08,167
It's my honor.

249
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,436
-You're too kind. We're counting on you.
-Great to have you.

250
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,873
I was in the fishing industry
for over 30 years.

251
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,475
-Fishing industry?
-He was in it for 30 years.

252
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,544
I've always wanted
to try a restaurant business.

253
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,846
-He wanted to open a restaurant.
-Is that so?

254
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,782
Should we look at the menu, then?

255
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,117
What does it say on the menu?

256
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,186
That's the hairtail meal.

257
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:31,223
So the hairtail meal
is 28,000 won per person.

258
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,360
It's 25,000 won each for two people,
with grilled and braised hairtail.

259
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:40,466
The meal comes with grilled
and braised hairtail, 25,000 per person.

260
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,634
That's a good deal.

261
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,803
I think I'll go with the meal.

262
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,504
-I'll go with the meal too.
-Yes.

263
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,440
We look forward to it, thank you.

264
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,108
ORDERS

265
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:53,045
HAIRTAIL MEAL - 2 SERVINGS

266
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,814
All crew members, come in!

267
00:11:56,315 --> 00:12:00,352
RACING TO SET UP THE SHOOT

268
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,291
-Here's your food.
-Thank you.

269
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:08,394
-This one's on the house.
-He says it's a freebie.

270
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:11,063
-It's bass.
-He say it's bass.

271
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,065
I caught it myself.

272
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:15,367
-He caught it himself.
-Wow, thank you.

273
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,970
-This is sea cucumber.
-It's sea cucumber.

274
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:21,607
I sliced it really thin in case anyone
has trouble with their teeth.

275
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,275
He sliced it really thin.

276
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,247
Koreans use wooden chopsticks for this too
because it's so slippery.

277
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:29,849
You use wooden chopsticks too.

278
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,585
-Thank you
-Thank you for the food.

279
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,587
I love sea cucumber.

280
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:35,654
-Do you?
-Yes.

281
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:37,423
I'll go in first.

282
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:42,328
-You dip it in chogochujang?
-We do in Korea.

283
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,396
In Japan, it's vinegar.

284
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:45,865
That's right.

285
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,500
It's pretty tangy.

286
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:50,035
-Is that so?
-It's not just gochujang, it's chojang.

287
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,238
So you make gochujang tangy.

288
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:53,305
"Cho" means vinegar.

289
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:00,112
-This is very fresh.
-It is, right?

290
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,348
The texture is phenomenal.

291
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:06,619
It's not a crunchy bite,
it's actually very firm.

292
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,555
I haven't had this in a while,
and it's really good.

293
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,857
The chef's knife work is like artistry.

294
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,760
I love that it's in very thin slices.

295
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:15,995
It's delicious.

296
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:17,263
The bass.

297
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:27,072
How is the fish
freshly caught by the chef?

298
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,441
Delicious.

299
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:33,546
This is delicious.

300
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:34,613
You like it?

301
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:40,853
It's very good.

302
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:42,621
It's good.

303
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:46,358
Bass doesn't usually
have such a bouncy texture.

304
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:49,495
Is it extra fresh or what? What is this?

305
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:50,830
-It's sweet.
-It's very sweet.

306
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,699
This is definitely high-quality bass.

307
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,101
-Is this the freebie we got?
-Yes.

308
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,170
-We might've hit the jackpot.
-Didn't I tell you?

309
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,905
I'm just lucky like that.

310
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:03,108
Everywhere I go,
I get served delicious food.

311
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,512
Wow, that's huge!

312
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,585
-Here's the hairtail meal.
-What is that?

313
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:14,587
What is this? Is this the meal?

314
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,355
Yes, this is the meal set.

315
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:17,857
An entire hairtail?

316
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:19,892
It's here.

317
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,361
This is the braised hairtail.

318
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:32,204
HAIRTAIL MEAL (2 SERVINGS)
50,000 WON / 5,000 YEN

319
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:34,807
Is there any special way to cut this?

320
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,110
You use your spoon and go like this.

321
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,112
-Like that?
-This is too luxurious.

322
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,714
I've never seen anything like this.

323
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,552
Look how oily it is!

324
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:49,889
There's some roe too.

325
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,024
There's roe in here.

326
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,329
Try it.

327
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,266
-Can I have it?
-Of course.

328
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:01,467
Thank you.

329
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:10,476
This is really good.

330
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,651
The umami just keeps on coming.

331
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,653
The oil in this is incredible.

332
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:25,257
How did the oil and sweetness get infused

333
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,559
into every bit of the fish?

334
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,728
It's rich and delicious.

335
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,664
-It's the hairtail oil.
-It's all oil from the fish.

336
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,732
-The hairtail oil.
-Yes, hairtail oil.

337
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,335
This hairtail was frozen, right?

338
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,404
And it's still this delicious.

339
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,772
This was frozen, right?

340
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:42,007
The hairtail? No, just refrigerated.

341
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,543
I caught it myself a few days ago.

342
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,545
He says it was caught recently.

343
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,646
-Delicious.
-It wasn't frozen.

344
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,682
-Very delicious.
-He says it's very delicious.

345
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:56,288
I sprinkled some of our restaurant's
special seasoning to make it delicious.

346
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,756
What kind of seasoning?

347
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:01,427
I wonder if you could figure it out
without me telling you.

348
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,529
-You want us to guess? Like a quiz?
-Yes.

349
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:06,465
He sprinkled some magical seasoning
on the grilled hairtail,

350
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,300
and wants us to guess what it is.

351
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,036
What the seasoning on the hairtail is.

352
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,038
It's something you eat a lot.

353
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,641
Young people
would be more familiar with it.

354
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,444
It's something young people know better.

355
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,579
Take a guess what it might be.

356
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,283
What do you think?

357
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,520
Is it cheese?

358
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:38,430
Is it ramyeon seasoning?

359
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,433
-It's cheese powder.
-Cheese powder?

360
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,235
-Oh, like parmesan.
-Yes, parmesan.

361
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,203
It's cheese.

362
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,105
I got it right.

363
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,341
I concede.

364
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:54,146
-It's good.
-The reason I began sprinkling parmesan

365
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,547
is because I had a dream…

366
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:58,484
-He says he developed menus in his dreams.
-Seriously.

367
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,719
-Parmesan cheese appeared in his dream?
-Yes.

368
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,856
THE FLAVOR TRICK INSPIRED BY A DREAM

369
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:05,891
In any case, this is really delicious.

370
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:09,561
I've never seen a hairtail
with this much roe inside.

371
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,338
Wow.

372
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:20,973
"Wow" is right.

373
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:29,081
-I've never had it like this.
-Hairtail bones are usually annoying,

374
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,383
but there's no problem
if you eat it like this.

375
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,085
This is the way to eat it luxuriously.

376
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:41,593
I'm going in.

377
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:45,531
Hairtail sushi.

378
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:55,107
-This place is good.
-Seriously.

379
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:56,041
I like it.

380
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:11,457
I lost that.

381
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,464
This grilled hairtail is good.

382
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,899
I've never had hairtail like this.

383
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,836
This place is getting me excited.

384
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,006
Braised hairtail.

385
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:34,279
-It's insane.
-What is it?

386
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:35,647
-It's insane.
-It's insane?

387
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:36,682
Is it that good?

388
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:38,050
Delicious.

389
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,390
This aroma is amazing.

390
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:55,467
It's delicious.

391
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:57,803
Delicious!

392
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,821
The braised hairtail is really good.

393
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,226
It's so good.

394
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,595
It's super tender

395
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:25,964
and sweet.

396
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:33,839
Honestly, braised hairtail usually
has a pretty predictable flavor.

397
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:38,610
The seasoning is so heavy that people
mainly look to see if the fish is fresh.

398
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:43,649
But fresh fish
is usually grilled or eaten raw,

399
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:46,818
you don't normally braise it.
But this place?

400
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:50,956
You can really tell
from the taste and smell of the oil.

401
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,925
-It's fresh.
-This fish is fresh.

402
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:57,963
Look how the vegetables
absorbed the broth like this.

403
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,932
That's the top part of a radish.

404
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,034
It's called mucheong shiraegi.

405
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:12,711
It's spicier than I expected,

406
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,147
but the shiraegi is delicious.

407
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:20,252
I can't stop smiling.

408
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,224
This shiraegi is no joke.

409
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:27,626
This really is "insane."

410
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,561
It's insane, it's insane.

411
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:45,677
All in all, I feel like the food in Busan

412
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,413
tends to have bold seasoning.

413
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,548
That's right.

414
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:53,118
This is definitely
thanks to the hairtail broth.

415
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,854
It's not saltiness or sweetness
or anything like that.

416
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,992
-The hairtail itself has this great broth.
-Exactly.

417
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:05,464
So the hairtail broth is powerful,
and the vegetables are packed with umami.

418
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:08,867
Oh, there's a radish!

419
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,102
-A radish.
-Please, go for it.

420
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,050
It's so delicious.

421
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,319
So delicious.

422
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:30,455
And because the radish
is also oily and full of juice,

423
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:35,160
it doesn't take a back seat
and actually complements the hairtail.

424
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,496
The radish is incredibly delicious.

425
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,398
And of course, in Korea…

426
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,134
you do this.

427
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:46,905
You have to do this.

428
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:52,044
MIXING RICE WITH BRAISED SAUCE IS A MUST

429
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:56,615
A piece of fish on top.

430
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:22,974
When the person next to me does that,
I want to have it too.

431
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:23,875
Of course.

432
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,180
Insane.

433
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:53,972
I don't usually order extra bowls of rice
now that I'm older,

434
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,440
but I could eat three bowls here.

435
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,576
Man, my diet. Gosh.

436
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,445
Could I get another bowl of rice?

437
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,715
The braised hairtail is insane.

438
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:10,655
Amazing.

439
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:14,259
If you visit Busan again,

440
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:15,627
you'll come here, right?

441
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,362
-Probably.
-It's so good.

442
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:18,563
Sir!

443
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,998
He'll come here whenever he's in Busan.

444
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,769
-How did you find the food?
-It was so good.

445
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,805
-The mucheong is exquisite.
-Very delicious.

446
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:30,041
This is food I feel totally confident
introducing to Japanese people.

447
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:31,109
It was so good.

448
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,811
-Thank you.
-It was the best.

449
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,846
-It was top-notch.
-He says it was top-notch.

450
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,381
I'll keep working harder.

451
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:38,784
He says he's still not good enough.

452
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,685
That's impossible.

453
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,421
I'll come back when I'm in Busan again.

454
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,322
Let's wrap up.

455
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:46,391
Forget that, this food is too good.

456
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:48,527
We want to eat too.

457
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,530
It's hard to find
braised hairtail like this even in Korea.

458
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,766
Do you know how much braised hairtail
I've had in my life?

459
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:55,934
-This one is…
-One, two, three.

460
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:56,835
The best?

461
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,338
-This is top-tier even among the best.
-You know,

462
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:04,342
it feels a little weird
to say this myself,

463
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,045
but isn't this episode
the jackpot of jackpots?

464
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,513
It is.

465
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:13,585
This kind of impromptu episode
is fun too, isn't it?

466
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:17,255
When you hit a good spot this way,
you feel about five times more joy.

467
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,591
This place is really good for Koreans too.

468
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:38,276
I'm not kidding. Seriously.

469
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:39,444
THE NEXT INSANELY GOOD SPOT

470
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:44,549
THE HANDS

471
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:49,387
AWAKEN CARNIVOROUS INSTINCTS

472
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:52,023
No matter where I suck on,
I can't get enough.

473
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:56,294
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT TEAR INTO IT, GAMJATANG

474
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:13,011
