THE HIGHEST PEAK IN THE ALPS

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,118
THE PINNACLE OF DESSERTS

00:00:18,247 --> 00:00:20,621
MONT BLANC (DESSERT)

4
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:24,658
A DESSERT SHAPED LIKE MONT BLANC
MADE MAINLY WITH CHESTNUTS

00:00:25,087 --> 00:00:28,629
TODAY'S INSANELY GOOD SPOT
LUXURY SILK-THREAD MONT BLANC

00:00:29,658 --> 00:00:33,367
EPISODE 21
THE MOST EXPENSIVE MONT BLANC IN KYOTO

7
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:36,970
K-foodie meets J-foodie.

8
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,405
This is insane.

9
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,309
KYOTO

10
00:00:42,938 --> 00:00:45,245
THE CAPITAL OF ANCIENT JAPAN

11
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:46,747
IT HAS BECOME A CULTURAL CENTER

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,273
ABOUT 56 MILLION TOURISTS VISITED IN 2024

13
00:00:53,115 --> 00:00:55,889
A WORLD-RENOWNED
TOURIST DESTINATION, KYOTO

14
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,527
A few years ago, I did a magazine shoot

15
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:02,729
-in Kyoto.
-Yes.

16
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:05,399
I asked, "What's delicious in Kyoto?"

17
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,235
And they said this Mont Blanc place

18
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:11,705
was all the rage at the time.

19
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,674
-Mont Blanc?
-Mont Blanc.

20
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,310
-Another dessert?
-Yes, another dessert.

21
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,146
I guess we're in Kyoto for desserts.

22
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:21,515
-Kyoto has great desserts.
-Their bread is good too.

23
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,650
-Their bread, their coffee.
-And the Western food.

24
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:26,186
-Their pizza is great.
-Right.

25
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:27,955
And dessert, dessert, dessert.

26
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:31,858
-If you're recommending it, we'll go.
-Well, it's…

27
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,560
It's on the pricey side.

28
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:35,729
-Is it expensive?
-Yes, it is.

29
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:38,899
-Is this the place?
-A premium Japanese chestnut dessert shop.

30
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:44,871
KYOTO'S INSANELY GOOD DESSERT SPOT

31
00:01:45,668 --> 00:01:49,610
MONT BLANC SPECIALTY SHOP
SAORI

32
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,678
-Hello.
-Hi.

33
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:54,514
Is that a shaved ice machine?

34
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,883
-No, it's a paste extruder.
-Paste?

35
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,752
-Yes.
-What do you squeeze through it?

36
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,454
Chestnut paste.

37
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,256
-I see.
-We put the paste in and squeeze it out.

38
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,527
-We're going in.
-It smells nice.

39
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,796
It smells incredible.

40
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,332
I want some delicious chestnuts!

41
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,006
It's a sophisticated place.

42
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:21,375
I agree. It seems like a trendy spot.

43
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,679
This is another date spot.

44
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:28,915
When I see you,

45
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,586
you usually eat meals
at hole-in-the-wall spots

46
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:36,356
but enjoy desserts at refined places.

47
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:40,394
It's hard not to pay attention

48
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:41,361
to what's trending.

49
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:43,764
Mont Blanc used to be

50
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:47,267
all the rage until recently.

51
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:52,172
Do you know when they started selling
Mont Blanc in Korea?

52
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,074
Well…

53
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:55,976
I'm not sure.

54
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:58,879
We had chestnut Mont Blanc in Japan

55
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,214
for quite a while.

56
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,950
As for Korea… I don't know.

57
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,921
People who are into desserts
probably know,

58
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:10,757
but I don't think
it was ever really a trend.

59
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:11,725
I see.

60
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,894
Most would think of
the fountain pen brand…

61
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:17,764
In Japan, when you say "Mont Blanc,"

62
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:22,803
we usually think of
the chestnut cake, not the fountain pen.

63
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,118
-In Korea, we have roasted chestnuts.
-Okay.

64
00:03:25,193 --> 00:03:26,423
It's a classic winter snack.

65
00:03:26,518 --> 00:03:29,876
They smell amazing when roasted.

66
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,279
-From autumn to winter.
-Right.

67
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,915
When chestnut season comes,

68
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:38,385
-you want some chestnut rice.
-Excuse me.

69
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:39,352
Hello.

70
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,089
-Let me explain the menu for you.
-Yes, please.

71
00:03:45,187 --> 00:03:46,727
SILK-THREAD MONT BLANC
TSUMUGI, RO, SHA

72
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,195
First, the "Sha" Mont Blanc

73
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:51,298
uses chestnuts grown
in Tamba, near Kyoto City.

74
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:52,232
Okay.

75
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:53,366
SHA
30,800 WON

76
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:54,634
"Ro" and "Tsumugi" Mont Blancs

77
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:58,705
use chestnuts from Ebino,
Miyazaki Prefecture.

78
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,474
TSUMUGI AND RO
EBINO CHESTNUTS

79
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,175
19,800 WON AND 24,200 WON EACH

80
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,578
Are chestnuts grown near Kyoto expensive?

81
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:07,047
Tamba and Sasayama

82
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:10,083
are known for delicious
and expensive produce.

83
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:13,353
The chestnuts are especially tasty
and considered premium.

84
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,089
Exactly. Our signature dish

85
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:18,024
is the silk-thread Mont Blanc, Sha.

86
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,192
Sha. I see.

87
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,495
-We only sell 40 a day.
-Only 40?

88
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:22,763
That's right.

89
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:25,732
We'll have the premium Sha
with Tamba chestnuts.

90
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,667
Let's get something else too.

91
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:32,372
The summer menu, shaved ice,
is available from June.

92
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,474
Isn't that your favorite?

93
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:37,144
-Patbingsu.
-Right.

94
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,112
What do you recommend?

95
00:04:39,508 --> 00:04:40,700
STRAWBERRY, MATCHA, BLUEBERRY

96
00:04:40,809 --> 00:04:44,184
-The signature is strawberry.
-The strawberry is popular, I see.

97
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:48,622
You can enjoy the combination
of Japanese strawberries and chestnuts.

98
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,123
JAPANESE STRAWBERRY
17,600 WON

99
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,559
-Shall we go with strawberry?
-Sounds good.

100
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,061
And drinks are complimentary.

101
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,898
You can each choose one drink
from the menu,

102
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,100
ranging from tea to apple juice.

103
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,302
This guy here

104
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:04,204
really wants to drink alcohol.

105
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:07,107
What kind of alcohol pairs well with this?

106
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,843
We have sparkling wine
from Tamba in Kyoto Prefecture.

107
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:10,911
EXTRA CHARGE APPLIES

108
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,345
I'll try that, then.

109
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:13,947
I'll have a hot coffee.

110
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:14,915
-One hot coffee.
-Yes.

111
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,316
-Okay.
-All right.

112
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,257
We'll prepare your Mont Blanc now.

113
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,259
He's making it right in front of us.

114
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,263
Do you always make it
in front of the customer?

115
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,266
Yes, we prepare it
in front of each customer.

116
00:05:39,535 --> 00:05:44,798
AFTER STACKING THE INGREDIENTS

117
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:47,447
TAMBA CHESTNUT PASTE

118
00:05:48,343 --> 00:05:52,172
HE PUTS THE CHESTNUT PASTE
INTO THE MONT BLANC MACHINE

119
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:56,056
-I'll begin making your Mont Blanc.
-Thank you.

120
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,057
It's finally starting.

121
00:05:58,225 --> 00:05:59,159
Here we go.

122
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,883
That makes me crave cold noodles.

123
00:06:24,313 --> 00:06:27,774
MONT BLANC WITH 1MM-THICK SILK THREADS

124
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,400
I can already smell it.

125
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,937
-You're right.
-Such a nice smell.

126
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:46,940
-And then…
-We put chestnut slices on top.

127
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,541
-Chestnut slices.
-I see.

128
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:55,282
Were those soaked in syrup or something?

129
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,750
They were boiled with the shells on.

130
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,818
-Boiled with the shells on.
-Yes.

131
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,592
-That's gold!
-Gold.

132
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:06,993
Literal gold.

133
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,395
It's expensive these days.

134
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,932
This is the silk-thread Mont Blanc,

135
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,533
-Sha.
-That's a hefty portion.

136
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,601
It's Impressive.

137
00:07:17,266 --> 00:07:19,973
SILK-THREAD MONT BLANC, SHA
30,800 WON, 3,080 YEN

138
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,209
It's built from the bottom up
with freshly baked crispy meringue…

139
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,411
Meringue.

140
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,413
EGG WHITES AND SUGAR, BAKED UNTIL CRISP

141
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,481
-Then sponge cake…
-Sponge cake.

142
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,450
…chestnut cream, and fresh cream.

143
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,885
Fresh cream.

144
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:36,323
And finished with our signature
silk-thread Mont Blanc chestnut cream.

145
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:44,431
The chestnuts used
are from Tamba, near Kyoto.

146
00:07:45,727 --> 00:07:48,301
CHESTNUT CREAM, CHESTNUT SILK THREADS,
CHESTNUT BOILED WITH SHELLS

147
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:50,203
TRIPLE CHESTNUT GOODNESS

148
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,538
My heart's pounding.

149
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:52,973
I need to cut it nicely.

150
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,274
You can't mess it up.

151
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:57,477
Please. You're the expert.

152
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,212
This seems tricky.

153
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:03,717
Have faith in yourself.

154
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,518
-I did it!
-I knew you could do it.

155
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:15,662
-Ta-da.
-Ta-da.

156
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,186
This totally is a date.

157
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,036
Now, this…

158
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:26,840
Don't worry about making mine look pretty.

159
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:30,810
Just make sure yours looks good.

160
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,312
That's fine.

161
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:33,480
It's okay.

162
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:35,415
It's okay.

163
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,983
Slide it onto the plate.

164
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,086
It's perfect.

165
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:41,654
-You didn't spill any.
-Yes.

166
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:44,991
You can eat from there.

167
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,197
Did you just use your fingers?

168
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,101
-You did, didn't you?
-No one saw it.

169
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:56,169
They won't know.

170
00:08:56,765 --> 00:08:58,905
FINGERPRINT DETECTED

171
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,446
-Let's dig in.
-Bon appétit.

172
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:18,558
This tastes more intense than I thought.

173
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,633
This is insanely good.

174
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,401
It's truly delicious.

175
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:30,837
No, really… It's kind of…

176
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:42,749
So good.

177
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:46,319
It's pleasantly sweet
without being cloying.

178
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:48,421
The sweetness isn't bad at all.

179
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,156
It tastes natural.

180
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,559
It's so silky.

181
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,760
It is smooth.

182
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:58,731
When you look at
a chestnut in its burr,

183
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,333
-it looks really fierce.
-Right.

184
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,038
You can sense that wildness in the aroma.

185
00:10:05,767 --> 00:10:08,108
THE HARMONY OF WILD AROMA

186
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,910
AND SOFT TEXTURE

187
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:18,017
You can find plenty
of Mont Blanc places in Tokyo too.

188
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,486
Sure.

189
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,055
But Tamba is so close to Kyoto.

190
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,724
Using Tamba chestnuts
makes it much more delicious.

191
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:26,960
I think I have a taste for desserts.

192
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:27,927
Really?

193
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:30,363
Why does this taste so good?

194
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,098
It's so delicious.

195
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,236
Is it because I've gotten older?

196
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:38,705
I've grown to like chestnuts.

197
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:41,407
-It's an old man thing.
-I guess.

198
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,309
-It can't be helped.
-Usually…

199
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,646
when people bring cake for everyone,

200
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:51,618
it's mostly the old men
who pick Mont Blanc.

201
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,953
Chestnuts are popular with older folks.

202
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,555
Old guys love it.

203
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,927
I hear something crunchy.

204
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:01,861
You're right.

205
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,250
MERINGUE

206
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,769
The meringue part

207
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,138
-has such an interesting texture.
-It does.

208
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,440
But it disappears
as soon as you bite into it.

209
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,844
Meringue is surprisingly airy
and just melts away.

210
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:20,246
So much puff for nothing.

211
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:21,748
It's gone in a heartbeat.

212
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,218
This is so good.

213
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:28,521
Not that I'm trying to pretend
that I'm a great son or anything…

214
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:30,990
but this really reminds me of my mom.

215
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,726
I really want my mom to try this.

216
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,296
Excuse me.

217
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,064
-Here are your drinks.
-Okay.

218
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:42,101
Here's your sparkling wine.

219
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,871
Here's your hot coffee

220
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:46,940
in a Japanese-style cup.

221
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:47,974
What is this?

222
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,109
That's broth.

223
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:51,811
-Broth?
-Yes.

224
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:54,814
The savory broth
is for cleansing your palate.

225
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,750
Kyoto really is a city of broth.

226
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,158
I like this.

227
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,794
-So thoughtful.
-Does it reset your palate?

228
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,230
Drinking the broth balances things out

229
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:13,499
after all that sweetness.

230
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,534
It is good.

231
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,306
The broth makes you
want more alcohol, right?

232
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,441
You know it.

233
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:22,775
Jjan.

234
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,477
Jjan.

235
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,251
It's good.

236
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,587
-Can I try that coffee?
-Sure.

237
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:45,598
-The coffee's nice too.
-Mont Blanc goes well with coffee.

238
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:48,034
Coffee gives it a sense of balance.

239
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:51,638
For a date, I'd recommend
the sparkling wine.

240
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:55,475
You'd want to liven things up
with some sparkling wine.

241
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:59,412
"How about some Mont Blanc
before we say goodbye?"

242
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,514
"With sparkling wine, of course."

243
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,449
Right, but I don't have anyone.

244
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:04,450
You've got me!

245
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:08,855
Sweetie, this place is so nice, right?

246
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,795
I really wanted to come here with you.

247
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:17,797
I just said I wanted
to come here together.

248
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,165
-With your girlfriend?
-Yes.

249
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,636
You mention wanting a girlfriend a lot,

250
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:26,105
but you're not that experienced, are you?

251
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,341
Other than with a gray-haired old man.

252
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,510
Should we do
a "matchmaking special" next time?

253
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,378
It'd be nice if you could set me up.

254
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:36,316
I don't have any female friends, though.

255
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:40,520
There's a saying in Korea.

256
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:43,756
"If you have money,
buy bread on your way home."

257
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:48,227
"If you have money,
buy bread on your way home."

258
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,430
It's like when you're nagging

259
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,965
without being helpful at all.

260
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,836
-Excuse me.
-It's here.

261
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,338
Here's your strawberry shaved ice.

262
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,873
I'll place it in the middle.

263
00:14:02,604 --> 00:14:05,165
STRAWBERRY SHAVED ICE
17,600 WON, 1,760 YEN

264
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:10,516
This fluffy shaved ice
is made with natural spring water

265
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,985
from the Suzuka Mountains
in Mie Prefecture.

266
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:16,356
On top, there's house-made
chestnut whipped cream

267
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:20,126
and strawberry syrup.
Please enjoy them together.

268
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,561
Is there chestnut in this too?

269
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,197
-The cream on top.
-This?

270
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:29,102
It's made with Japanese chestnuts
from Miyazaki Prefecture.

271
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:31,838
Here are some small bowls for you to use.

272
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:33,740
I'm not sure if we can split this.

273
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:37,610
Let's just eat this like a couple,
with our heads together.

274
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,278
Pretend this is a date.

275
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,614
Maybe we should put two straws in here

276
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:43,750
and drink it together.

277
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,219
Go ahead.

278
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,187
I want you to try it first, honey.

279
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:21,921
I like this.

280
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:23,990
That's good to hear.

281
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,431
It's packed with strawberry flavor.

282
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:35,067
It's like a super-premium version
of Screw Bar.

283
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:40,406
There's a strawberry-flavored ice pop
called Screw Bar.

284
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:41,607
-Screw Bar?
-Yes.

285
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,910
It's a classic Korean ice pop.

286
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,746
-Screw Bar.
-It feels like the luxury version of that.

287
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,148
This is creamy with that strawberry tang,

288
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:50,883
so it's sweet and tart.

289
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:56,189
But the sweetness tastes so natural.

290
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:59,091
The cream is so silky.

291
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,928
The cream is a bit different.

292
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,042
It's delicious.

293
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,512
What is this chunk here?

294
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:23,015
Strawberry… Wait, what's this?

295
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,317
What could it be?

296
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:26,319
There's something in here.

297
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,988
-What could it be?
-What is it?

298
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,091
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

299
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:36,362
What is this? It doesn't seem
like strawberry chunks.

300
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:39,332
Those are chestnut pieces.

301
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:40,533
Chestnut chunks?

302
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,868
We add Japanese chestnuts

303
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,240
-in the shaved ice too.
-I see.

304
00:16:43,915 --> 00:16:47,607
You can also enjoy the fluffy texture
of Japanese chestnuts with this dessert.

305
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,276
It's rare to see chestnuts
and strawberries paired in a dish.

306
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:53,012
It's an unexpected combo,
but they go well together.

307
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,780
-They do?
-They pair nicely.

308
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,184
It's the first time I've had
strawberry shaved ice with chestnuts.

309
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:00,353
Surprisingly, they're a good match.

310
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:03,456
It's sour, sweet, and cold,
so there's a lot going on,

311
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:07,293
but the dense texture
of the chestnuts lingers at the end.

312
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,896
It leaves you wanting more
after each bite.

313
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,264
If it weren't for the chestnut,

314
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:15,201
it would've been too sour
and cold to keep eating.

315
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,884
I really like this place.

316
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:33,185
You do?

317
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:37,823
If I ever get married someday,
I want to bring my wife here.

318
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,494
It feels like every time we go somewhere,

319
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:45,097
you're always thinking about

320
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,333
coming back with a girlfriend.

321
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,603
You don't seem to be able to enjoy
a meal or dessert

322
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,205
purely for what it is.

323
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:55,775
But you already have a full life.

324
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,176
No, I don't.

325
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,111
-I mean…
-Things are over for me!

326
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:02,648
-I'm in the second half of my life.
-You have a wife, kids,

327
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,983
even a grandkid.

328
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,018
And your career is perfect.

329
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,688
-Now you've even started directing movies.
-You're exaggerating.

330
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,856
I haven't even gotten married yet.

331
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,492
I think I've had more desserts with you

332
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,495
than I ever had in my whole life.

333
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,998
That's why you don't have
much luck with women.

334
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:22,568
Believe it or not,
I used to be popular back in the day.

335
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:26,372
Then that's why you're not now.

336
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,408
"I don't really want a dessert,

337
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:32,178
but if you want it, I'll have some…"

338
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,646
That kind of attitude doesn't work.

339
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:35,014
When I like someone,

340
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:38,384
-I'd do whatever they want.
-You should say something like this.

341
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,988
"The combination
of strawberries and chestnuts…

342
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:46,892
I didn't think it'd work,
but it's actually really good."

343
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,428
However,

344
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:54,100
sharing one dessert with someone else…

345
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:59,605
It's been a while.
It feels kind of strange.

346
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,941
It's a little awkward, honestly.

347
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:07,146
It reminds me of when
I used to share earphones.

348
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:11,150
I'd think, "This is nice,"
and turn my head.

349
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:13,319
And there you are, with gray hair.

350
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:20,259
-"This isn't quite what I had in mind…"
-This is nice.

351
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,929
It's not that I don't like this moment.

352
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,766
I like you and look up to you,

353
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,402
but when it's just two guys…

354
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,737
I can't help but think, "Is this okay?"

355
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:33,773
What do you mean, "Is this okay"?

356
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,641
In Korea, this counts as an indirect kiss!

357
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:37,910
THE NEXT INSANELY GOOD SPOT

358
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:40,212
-Octopus.
-Live squid.

359
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,851
CEPHALOPOD ROUND

360
00:19:41,943 --> 00:19:43,349
DOUBLE HIT
LIVE SQUID

361
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,684
SLICED RAW

362
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,818
I'm sorry.

363
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,223
This is actually insane.

364
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,458
DEEP-FRIED

365
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,329
Crispy.

366
00:19:54,404 --> 00:19:56,562
-You can't get this anywhere else.
-Fukuoka's the best!

367
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:58,798
Every Korean needs to try this. Seriously.

368
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,533
SQUID IS DELICIOUS IN EVERY FORM

369
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,281
