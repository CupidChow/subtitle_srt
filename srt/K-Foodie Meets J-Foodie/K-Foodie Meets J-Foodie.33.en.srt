1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,205
K-foodie meets J-foodie.

2
00:00:05,272 --> 00:00:06,540
This is insane.

00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:09,276

LEE DAE-HO'S INSANELY GOOD SPOT IN BUSAN

15
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:40,340
EPISODE 32
HOME RUN! THE FLAVORS OF BUSAN

16
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,484
You look happy today.

17
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,786
That song is called
"Take Me Out to the Ball Game."

18
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:56,223
I see. We are at Sajik Stadium now.

19
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,791
This is the heart of Busan.

20
00:00:57,858 --> 00:01:00,060
Home of the Lotte Giants.

21
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:01,361
SAJIK BASEBALL STADIUM

22
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,530
I heard people in Busan
are obsessed with baseball.

23
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:06,099
-They are absolutely crazy about it.
-Okay.

24
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:09,703
Since we're visitors today

25
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,605
and are unfamiliar with the area,

26
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:15,375
it's best to get tips from a local

27
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:16,743
who knows all the info.

28
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,114
Do we have someone like that?

29
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:19,664
The best player from the Lotte Giants.

30
00:01:19,764 --> 00:01:21,982
-A legendary star.
-He already is a legend.

31
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,585
Korea's representative

32
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,720
cleanup hitter.

33
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:28,455
He even played in Fukuoka.

34
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:30,757
-With SoftBank?
-Yes.

35
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,960
-He was the MVP.
-MVP.

36
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,895
So he was the MVP of the Japan Series.

37
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:36,063
Yes.

38
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,331
And he's here today.

39
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:39,066
I see someone big coming.

40
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:41,969
Welcome!

41
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,337
-Hello.
-Hello.

42
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:44,471
This is Lee Dae-ho.

43
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,440
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

44
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:47,941
Hello, I am Matjjigae.

45
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:49,776
Your Japanese sounds so good.

46
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:51,278
Welcome.

47
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:52,946
He's a big guy.

48
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:54,848
-How have you been?
-It's been a while.

49
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,117
The interpreter will cover the Japanese,

50
00:01:57,184 --> 00:02:01,989
-and I'll be your interpreter.
-Okay.

51
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,684
Ask him something you're curious about.

52
00:02:03,809 --> 00:02:05,459
You're in great shape.

53
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,995
-Are you still in shape?
-He lost quite a bit of weight.

54
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,263
This is me after a diet.

55
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,300
He said this is him after being on a diet.

56
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,103
-I lost 15 kilograms.
-He dropped 15 kilograms.

57
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,804
-Fifteen?
-Yes.

58
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,607
During his prime,

59
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,376
he was around 145 kilograms.

60
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:26,079
It's a secret.

61
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:27,114
He was 145 kilograms?

62
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,383
But he was amazingly flexible

63
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,885
and strong.

64
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,187
But he was slower on his feet.

65
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:36,823
That's just a fact.

66
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,291
-So he didn't run.
-Right.

67
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,393
Never.

68
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:43,897
Were you born and raised in Busan, Dae-ho?

69
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:47,300
-Yes, I was born in Busan…
-He was born in Busan…

70
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,935
-…played ball here…
-…played ball here…

71
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,771
-…and still live here.
-…and still lives here.

72
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,874
He's basically Busan's mascot.

73
00:02:54,103 --> 00:02:55,442
BUSAN'S MASCOT

74
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:59,546
So you must know Busan really well.

75
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,848
-Yes.
-Of course. Naturally.

76
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:04,584
-What are we having today?
-For today…

77
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,220
A homestyle meal in the city.

78
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:10,090
-Nice.
-Food that tastes like mom's cooking.

79
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:12,292
And the "mom" here

80
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,661
-is my friend's mom.
-It's his friend's mom's place.

81
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,063
-Friend's mom?
-Yes.

82
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,832
Is the friend also a baseball player?

83
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,638
-Is your friend also a player?
-He was.

84
00:03:20,688 --> 00:03:22,569
-Lee Seung-ha.
-A Giant for more than ten years.

85
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:24,404
He played for the Giants
for over a decade.

86
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:27,507
He and I have been friends
since elementary school.

87
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:28,775
-I see.
-Yes.

88
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,777
-Shall we go?
-Let's go.

89
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:32,412
After you.

90
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,681
So across the street,
there's a McDonald's.

91
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:37,250
-Been there for a long time.
-There's a McDonald's.

92
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,285
-McDonald's?
-Yes.

93
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:41,021
-It's been there for more than 20 years.
-It's over 20 years.

94
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,522
So it's been there for a while.

95
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:47,427
This area must get packed with people

96
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:49,463
on the Giants' game days.

97
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,565
-When the Giants play…
-People start gathering

98
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,967
-after two o'clock.
-After two o'clock,

99
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,570
-people start gathering.
-The game starts at 6:30 p.m.

100
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:59,673
If the Giants win,
people must go wild afterwards.

101
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,174
Same when they lose.

102
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,577
Even when they lose, they'd still…

103
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:06,980
Were the Lotte Giants already around

104
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:09,149
when you wanted to be a baseball player?

105
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:10,484
Yes, I've been a fan

106
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,153
-since I was a kid.
-He's been a fan since he was young.

107
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,187
I see.

108
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,790
Wasn't there a draft system?

109
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:19,292
I was a first-round pick.

110
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,428
You must have been thrilled.

111
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:23,897
My final dream was to win
the Korean Series with the Giants.

112
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:25,732
But they haven't won since 1992.

113
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:29,002
DAE-HO RETIRED IN 2022
WITHOUT EVER WINNING THE KOREAN SERIES

114
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,704
-Oh, that's…
-He never did.

115
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,073
This beef short rib place is nice, too.

116
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,042
-He said this one's not bad, either.
-My picture's here.

117
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,912
-There's my photo.
-A celebrity indeed.

118
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:41,410
This makguksu spot
used to be a shabby little place.

119
00:04:41,485 --> 00:04:43,283
Jumunjin Makguksu.
They sell buckwheat noodles.

120
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,012
-That's a stir-fried nakji place.
-Octopus?

121
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:46,122
-Long-arm octopus.
-Nakji.

122
00:04:46,212 --> 00:04:47,687
There's a variety of restaurants here.

123
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:48,889
I like this neighborhood.

124
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,223
It's nice.

125
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,692
So where are we headed today?

126
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,528
This one right here.

127
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,663
-Here?
-Yes.

128
00:04:57,898 --> 00:04:59,566
-Eomeoni.
-Yes, "mother" is eomeoni.

129
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,269
When addressing someone else's mom,
you say eomeonim.

130
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,603
-Eomeonim?
-Eomeonim.

131
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,671
Eomeonim.

132
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:05,772
-Hello.
-Hello.

133
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,873
-Welcome.
-Eomeonim?

134
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,642
Come on in.

135
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,076
Thank you for having us.

136
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,344
Dae-ho, you look wonderful.

137
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,913
Pleasure to meet you all.

138
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,781
I've seen her so many times, so she…

139
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:16,616
SEUNGHAJIB

140
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,351
LEE DAE-HO'S INSANELY GOOD SPOT

141
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,421
A FIVE-MINUTE WALK FROM SAJIK STADIUM

142
00:05:21,817 --> 00:05:24,090
RUN BY FORMER BASEBALL PLAYER
LEE SEUNG-HA'S MOM

143
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,094
FILLED WITH MEMORIES
OF DAE-HO AND SEUNG-HA

144
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,197
DAE-HO
SEUNG-HA

145
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,499
SEUNG-HA

146
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,935
DAE-HO

147
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,304
SEUNG-HA'S MOTHER'S COOKING
THAT NURTURED THEM

148
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,873
FROM CHILDHOOD TO ADULTHOOD

149
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,044
This is interesting.
Most restaurants in Korea

150
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,680
specialize in a single dish,

151
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,716
but this place offers a wide variety.

152
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:51,184
There's a lot to choose from.

153
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:53,653
-It has a homey vibe.
-They have homestyle food.

154
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,489
This place has a homey feel,

155
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,124
but also a bit of a street stall vibe.

156
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,026
-You know…
-It's a bit like a street stall.

157
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,162
-Street stall.
-You can order whatever you want.

158
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:05,365
If there's something you want,
she'll make it for you.

159
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:10,971
Ma'am, I know everything here
is delicious,

160
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,939
but can we get Dae-ho's usual?

161
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:15,375
Whenever I'm here, I always go for

162
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,344
-suyuk, boiled pork belly.
-Suyuk.

163
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,513
It is served with various kinds of kimchi.

164
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:24,451
-And a whole octopus.
-That's the same as Japanese tako.

165
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,753
-Tako.
-And as a side, char-grilled bulgogi.

166
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,622
-That's just a side for you?
-Yes.

167
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:32,792
DAE-HO'S PICK:
SUYUK, WHOLE OCTOPUS, CHAR-GRILLED BULGOGI

168
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:34,661
Thank you

169
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,931
for making time for us today.

170
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:39,499
Thanks for having me.

171
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,334
Thank you.

172
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,107
-Jjan!
-Jjan! It's great to be here together.

173
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:03,023
When you came back to Busan,

174
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,393
what was the first thing
you craved the most?

175
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,694
For me,

176
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,596
just home-cooked food.

177
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,865
Things like fish cakes stir-fried
with gochujang.

178
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,134
Just simple side dishes and rice.

179
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,902
Ordinary side dishes?

180
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,773
Do they taste different
from Seoul or other regions?

181
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,174
Can you tell you're back in Busan?

182
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:22,676
-They are different.
-You can tell.

183
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,878
Food in Busan
and Jeolla Province has bolder flavors.

184
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:29,316
Busan and Jeolla Province in the south
use heavier seasonings than the north.

185
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,485
How did meals work

186
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:35,088
during your playing days?

187
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:37,924
Usually, lunch was served
at the hotel around noon.

188
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:41,127
They had lunch at noon at the hotel.

189
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,396
And we'd practice after lunch.

190
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,232
They'd prepare snacks for us
an hour before the game,

191
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,968
but the ones playing skipped them.

192
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,870
They have snacks out
at 5:00 p.m. before the game,

193
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:53,573
but those in the lineup
usually don't eat them.

194
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,843
Is that the same in Japan

195
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,044
or in the States?

196
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,879
-Exactly the same.
-Really? Even MLB?

197
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,247
Yes, it's the same.

198
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,882
In MLB,

199
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:06,286
they'd serve steak or Western dishes.
We'd get Korean food in Korea.

200
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:09,923
In the U.S., they'd serve steak
or Western meals.

201
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,257
-Meat.
-Something heavy.

202
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,659
Exactly.

203
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,594
When I was with the Seattle Mariners,

204
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,396
there were Japanese players.

205
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:17,731
Ichiro was there,

206
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:21,167
and Iwakuma and Aoki
were also with the Mariners.

207
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,136
So sushi was always on the snack menu.

208
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,938
I see.

209
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,042
Without them around,
he'd have had steak every day.

210
00:08:27,142 --> 00:08:28,333
That would be rough.

211
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:32,479
-True.
-Let's hear about the side dishes.

212
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,514
It's geonbbang, hardtack! That's unusual.

213
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:35,982
Geonbbang?

214
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,018
-Geonbbang. Yes.
-Geonbbang?

215
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,286
-Geonbbang.
-Geonbbang.

216
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,255
I know this one.

217
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:44,057
We keep these for earthquakes.

218
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,925
-They're long-lasting…
-In Japan? I see.

219
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,427
They're emergency rations.

220
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:48,828
Is this seasoned?

221
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,098
Probably deep-fried
and sprinkled with sugar.

222
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,666
I've never seen this before.

223
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,101
It's pretty good.

224
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:56,736
Let me try this.

225
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,477
It's a snack.

226
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,513
I knew you'd like it.

227
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:11,551
But what on earth is this?

228
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:13,219
A bug? A larva?

229
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:15,522
-This…
-This is beondegi.

230
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,524
-Is it called beondegi?
-Beondegi.

231
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,195
BEONDEGI
SILKWORM PUPAE THAT PRODUCE SILK

232
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,564
IN KOREA, IT IS EATEN BOILED OR BRAISED
AS A STREET SNACK

233
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,232
Feels a bit off, doesn't it?

234
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,835
I'm fine with bugs, though.

235
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,503
I'm not scared of them or anything.

236
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:35,475
In Japan, people in Nagano Prefecture

237
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,278
eat bee larvae,

238
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:41,681
but in Kyushu, where I lived,
the most we ever had were grasshoppers.

239
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:42,615
Grasshoppers.

240
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,087
Between grasshoppers and pupae,
I'd choose pupae.

241
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,389
I'd take grasshoppers.

242
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:52,025
When I was in elementary school,

243
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,527
you could buy
a paper cup of beondegi for 100 won.

244
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,929
Like…

245
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,731
We'd walk around
eating them with toothpicks.

246
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,468
-Come on. Really?
-I actually love this.

247
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,837
-Dae-ho, do you like them too?
-I do.

248
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,171
Not a fan?

249
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,773
-I do like them.
-Really?

250
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,675
Anyone here who doesn't like beondegi?

251
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,076
Anyone?

252
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,045
Someone over there!

253
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,379
What do they taste like?

254
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,148
They're really creamy.

255
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,350
-He said it's creamy.
-Creamy?

256
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,959
-I'll give it a try.
-Seriously?

257
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,570
For a moment,

258
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,771
it tasted like an almond.

259
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:42,408
It has that nutty flavor.

260
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,277
-Nuts.
-Nuts.

261
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,652
It bursts when you bite it,
and you can taste the creaminess a bit.

262
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:56,990
-Like almond cream.
-Exactly.

263
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,527
If you grew up eating this,
you might like it,

264
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:04,430
but the first time you try it,
you'd wonder why anyone would eat it.

265
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,433
But he actually had two.

266
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,102
I didn't expect him to.

267
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,509
Here it comes.

268
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,479
We use fresh pork belly for this.

269
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,047
Amazing.

270
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,326
-Oh, you lightly seared the skin.
-Yes.

271
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:34,961
We use a blowtorch.

272
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,833
The leafy greens are so fresh.

273
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,771
KOREAN MINT, NAPA CABBAGE, WATER PARSLEY,
LETTUCE, PERILLA LEAVES

274
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,707
The kimchi looks incredible.

275
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:54,647
BABY NAPA CABBAGE, MUSTARD LEAF,
NAPA CABBAGE, GREEN ONION KIMCHI

276
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,115
Is this mustard leaf kimchi?

277
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:58,585
-You really love that one.
-That's my favorite.

278
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,086
It's really delicious.

279
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,223
SUYUK (LARGE)
WITH LEAFY GREENS AND 4 TYPES OF KIMCHI

280
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,290
55,000 WON, 5,500 YEN

281
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:06,392
Please go ahead.

282
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,360
Thank you.

283
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:10,663
You can eat it as is,
or with some ssamjang.

284
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,366
-First, I'll try it as is.
-Okay.

285
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:26,813
This…

286
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,950
That seared fat at the top layer

287
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:34,654
-gives it such a rich flavor.
-Right.

288
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:39,459
It really does.

289
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:40,693
This is delicious.

290
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:44,397
I've never had anything like this before.

291
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,232
Is this how it's usually eaten in Busan?

292
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,500
No.

293
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,502
-Only here.
-Only this place does it like this.

294
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:53,206
-Mom's special recipe.
-That's just how she does it?

295
00:12:59,024 --> 00:13:01,447
-You can't cut it like that.
-Should I have cut it vertically?

296
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:02,982
Like this. That's how it's done.

297
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,353
-You know that. Just cut the top.
-You cut it wrong.

298
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:10,857
That was an earful.

299
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,692
It's fine. Let's just eat it as is.

300
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:13,793
-Stop.
-Okay.

301
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:16,062
If you tear the kimchi vertically,

302
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,831
wrap some suyuk in it, and take a bite,
it's amazing.

303
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,466
-Vertically?
-Yes.

304
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,935
-I got scolded by a junior.
-You did.

305
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,771
Vertically?

306
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:28,708
Like this?

307
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:30,677
-There.
-Okay.

308
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,612
I like this.

309
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:49,929
Thank you.

310
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:53,633
It's good.

311
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,034
So tasty.

312
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:59,372
This kimchi is amazing.

313
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:03,776
I get that kimchi
is fermented and full of probiotics,

314
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,646
but it really has that probiotic taste.

315
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,581
There's this creamy note to it.

316
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,850
-Like yogurt.
-Yes, just like yogurt.

317
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:13,404
I can actually smell
that fermented yogurt-like aroma.

318
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,422
-That's because probiotics are alive.
-Exactly.

319
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:19,892
So the kimchi's flavor changes over time.

320
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,195
And it tastes different
depending on who makes it.

321
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,664
That's what makes kimchi so fascinating.

322
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,007
This green onion kimchi is insane.

323
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,143
All the kimchi here is seriously good.

324
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,887
This mustard leaf kimchi
is amazing, too.

325
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,722
He really loves mustard leaf kimchi.

326
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:25,258
-I see.
-They eat mustard leaves in Fukuoka.

327
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,794
He loves it so much,
so I get him some whenever he's in Korea.

328
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,832
-Delicious.
-It's so good.

329
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:34,333
After a game,

330
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,602
I came here and drank soju with these.

331
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,023
These are the kind of dishes
that make you drink soju nonstop.

332
00:15:39,123 --> 00:15:40,006
I see.

333
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,742
I even brought the Giants players here
for team dinners.

334
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:47,713
He often had team dinners here
with all the Giants players.

335
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,682
This place is a landmark.

336
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:53,352
This neighborhood
is basically Lee Dae-ho's territory.

337
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,323
Is this perilla leaf? No?

338
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,724
That's Korean mint.

339
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,892
-Korean mint.
-Korean mint.

340
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,228
KOREAN MINT
SLIGHTLY BITTER AND REFRESHING HERB

341
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,631
Adding these to a ssam
gives it a great aroma.

342
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,733
It has a wonderful aroma.

343
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,637
Take a leaf or two
and add them to your ssam.

344
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,574
The aroma really pops.

345
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,576
I always add two pieces of meat.

346
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:30,022
He really hates it
when others make a ssam for him.

347
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,290
So my current goal

348
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:34,660
is to have him eat a ssam I make one day.

349
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,696
But I always fail.

350
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,166
I should give it to Dae-ho.

351
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,201
Long time no see.

352
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,146
That must feel nice.

353
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,915
I grumbled to him a bit

354
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:58,885
that I've tried to make you a ssam,
but you've refused so many times

355
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,920
that I've lost the courage to.

356
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:11,197
I got all excited.

357
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:14,033
-He was hoping for it.
-I got my hopes up for nothing.

358
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,444
A whole octopus came out.

359
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:35,388
BOILED WHOLE OCTOPUS

360
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:44,163
SESAME OIL SAUCE
AND CHOJANG, VINEGARED GOCHUJANG

361
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:48,601
WHOLE OCTOPUS
MARKET PRICE

362
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:51,938
Do you always serve the octopus like this?

363
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,773
Do you always serve the octopus whole?

364
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,608
-Yes, always.
-They always serve it whole.

365
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,110
-"Whole Octopus."
-That's why it's called "Whole."

366
00:17:58,177 --> 00:17:59,278
-Whole.
-Whole.

367
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:01,480
It goes for market price.

368
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,149
They charge market price for it.

369
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:05,952
Market price… That must cost quite a bit.

370
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,760
This part is oishi.

371
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,696
-The very tip.
-He said this part's the best.

372
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,030
It's the softest.

373
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,466
-For you.
-Thank you.

374
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,301
It looks so good.

375
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:23,636
Sesame oil.

376
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,905
Mix it well.

377
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:29,609
Dunk a piece of octopus in it.

378
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,677
Thank you.

379
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,256
It's a simple, clean flavor.

380
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,326
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

381
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:48,628
Cheers.

382
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:51,764
Wow, it's so tender.

383
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,567
It really is.

384
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:57,336
This is chojang.

385
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,338
You can change the flavor with it.

386
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:12,652
How is it?

387
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:16,022
It's really tangy.

388
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:17,690
That's because she made it.

389
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:19,191
-It's homemade?
-Yes.

390
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,227
This is not the tube chojang
from the supermarket.

391
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:22,495
-I can tell.
-This whole thing.

392
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:23,863
It's quite unique.

393
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,569
Why do Koreans love octopus so much?

394
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,405
Don't Japanese people like it too?

395
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:36,075
-Japanese people eat it as takoyaki.
-Takoyaki.

396
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:39,545
We rarely eat octopus as a main dish.

397
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,550
The "mun" in muneo, octopus, is the same
as the "mun" in munhag, literature.

398
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:47,653
It was a prized seafood.

399
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,188
Octopus was high-end,

400
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:51,090
-favored by the upper class.
-True.

401
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:53,893
-Shouldn't we eat this as samhap?
-You're right.

402
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,662
"Sam" means three,
and "hap" means to combine.

403
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,164
Together, it's called samhap.

404
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,100
Pork, octopus, and kimchi.

405
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:02,868
Shall we try a samhap?

406
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,503
All three together?

407
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,239
Meat.

408
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,041
PORK

409
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:10,376
Octopus.

410
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:11,677
PORK + OCTOPUS

411
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:14,413
Kimchi.

412
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,649
PORK + OCTOPUS + KIMCHI

413
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,384
Like this…

414
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,530
I'll wrap it in kimchi instead.

415
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:42,208
The octopus probably never imagined
ending up in a combo like this.

416
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:43,509
It's so good.

417
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:48,814
I'll give it a try.

418
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,886
Pork, kimchi, and octopus.

419
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:21,113
I've learned
that you could eat it like this.

420
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,348
I mean…

421
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:25,017
A lot was going on in my mouth just now.

422
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:27,419
-The more I chewed…
-Different textures come through.

423
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:31,323
…the more I wondered,
"What is this delicious thing

424
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,194
that's neither pork nor octopus?"
It was such a curious sensation.

425
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:37,463
Koreans love ssam.

426
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:39,865
We enjoy the way flavors unfold

427
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,269
in our mouths from different combinations.

428
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:45,638
Japanese people, on the other hand,

429
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:49,441
enjoy analyzing and savoring

430
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:52,978
the subtle taste
of each individual ingredient.

431
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:56,482
Koreans mix everything wildly

432
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:59,518
and find the charm in the combination.

433
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:02,555
I've learned a lot doing this show.

434
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,790
In Japan, something like this

435
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:06,292
would be considered unconventional.

436
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,661
Right. Interesting.

437
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:12,331
Dae-ho, what food surprised you the most

438
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:15,768
-when you were in Japan?
-Yes, let's ask that.

439
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,304
When you eat a salmon roe rice bowl,

440
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,973
the way the roe burst in your mouth
and release that smell…

441
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,742
-Really?
-But Japanese people love it.

442
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,078
When salmon roe pops in your mouth…

443
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:27,546
-When it pops?
-Yes.

444
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:30,516
He thought it was too much.
He couldn't eat it.

445
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,753
-He can't eat salmon roe?
-I love it, though.

446
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:36,789
You don't eat salmon roe in Korea?

447
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,591
It's sold, but it's not commonly eaten.

448
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,026
In Hokkaido, salmon roe rice bowls

449
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,232
often come piled high,

450
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:47,700
-which many people love.
-I like it.

451
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,736
-Do you like it?
-I'm absolutely crazy about it.

452
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:52,504
He's really into food.

453
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,974
-Still…
-That's interesting. You have a cute side.

454
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,910
-I never had it in four years.
-He didn't eat it once in four years.

455
00:22:57,977 --> 00:22:59,178
Really?

456
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:01,780
-I had yakiniku. Just meat.
-He likes yakiniku.

457
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,851
What else do you like?

458
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:07,720
-Japanese draft beer.
-Draft beer.

459
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:10,556
Draft beer is amazing.

460
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:12,491
-Draft beer?
-Draft beer tastes amazing.

461
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:15,094
You should check out Nampo-dong next time.

462
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,395
-In Nampo-dong…
-Nampo-dong.

463
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:17,730
…you can get hagfish,

464
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:20,232
-and even whale meat.
-We can eat whale meat there.

465
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:21,667
Whale meat?

466
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,836
Yes, they have whale meat in Busan.

467
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:27,806
Outside Busan or Ulsan,
Koreans don't really eat whale meat.

468
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,241
People in Seoul don't eat it.

469
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:31,510
How do you eat it?

470
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,445
-As sashimi.
-As sashimi.

471
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:36,248
WHALE SASHIMI

472
00:23:36,315 --> 00:23:39,752
I grew up eating whale meat
in school lunches,

473
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:42,888
so I never thought of it
as a luxury or special dish.

474
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:44,823
He had it in school lunches as a kid.

475
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,860
-Whale meat?
-Yes, protein was scarce.

476
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,828
Back then, Japan also had bacon.

477
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,463
-Whale bacon was a thing.
-Whale bacon.

478
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,465
Today, it's a super high-end delicacy,

479
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:55,634
but back then, it was everyday food.

480
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:57,836
They had it as a side dish.

481
00:23:58,337 --> 00:24:00,105
-Finally.
-Finally!

482
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:02,975
Char-grilled bulgogi.

483
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:07,880
SEARED WITH A BLOWTORCH FOR A SMOKY FLAVOR

484
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:13,886
CHAR-GRILLED BULGOGI
20,000 WON, 2,000 YEN

485
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:16,588
-Do I eat it as is?
-With some green onions.

486
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:17,656
-Got it.
-Yes.

487
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,639
-This is delicious.
-It's really good.

488
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:35,607
I know, right?

489
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:43,916
That smoky flavor.

490
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,252
This is insanely good. What the heck?

491
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,721
It's really tasty.

492
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:50,255
It makes you eat through the sweat.

493
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,391
-Isn't it spicy?
-Yes.

494
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:55,828
-Looks like it's too spicy for him.
-It's pretty hot.

495
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:58,897
-The spice lingers.
-The spiciness hits at the end.

496
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:02,568
Is this Busan-style,
or is it just this restaurant's style?

497
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,136
This is this restaurant's style.

498
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:07,206
-Their original style.
-Not every place in Busan

499
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:10,609
makes char-grilled pork bulgogi this good.

500
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:11,710
Really?

501
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:14,413
This sauce would make
killer stir-fried cartilage.

502
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,514
Cartilage with soju.

503
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:17,483
We have to come back here next time.

504
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:19,018
It'll be intense.

505
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:20,486
This is pretty spicy.

506
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:21,987
Yes, seriously.

507
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:23,922
This makes me want to eat rice.

508
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:26,525
-Earlier…
-Can we have some rice?

509
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:30,195
MOM'S FLUFFY, PERFECTLY COOKED RICE

510
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,765
Perfect timing.

511
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,100
Thank you.

512
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,270
The color of the bowls is interesting.

513
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:40,439
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

514
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:42,374
I need to make a ssam myself.

515
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:50,382
-Take a big scoop of rice like this.
-Here.

516
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:53,185
Place the rice on top.

517
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:54,720
Rice.

518
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:02,294
Always add two pieces of meat.

519
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:10,469
Wrap this up and eat it.
It's the taste of heaven.

520
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:15,340
-Heaven in your mouth.
-Heaven in your mouth.

521
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:18,911
Wrap it up like this…

522
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:28,587
When it comes to eating ssam…

523
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:30,389
You should put it all in.

524
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:31,757
All in one bite.

525
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,294
-It's not meant to be bitten.
-This is not gimbap.

526
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,296
-You don't bite ssam.
-This is not gimbap.

527
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:38,664
-For ssam…
-All in one bite.

528
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:39,665
There you go.

529
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:43,302
It's tricky.

530
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,742
It tastes even better with rice.

531
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,078
As a Japanese person,

532
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:56,348
I'd want to put it on rice
and make a rice bowl.

533
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:12,131
Pile the meat on rice like this.

534
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,832
That's it.

535
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:16,502
-He suggested it, so…
-There you go.

536
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,103
I think that's the best way.

537
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:48,567
It's good.

538
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:49,668
The best.

539
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:51,503
Heavenly.

540
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:54,239
The taste of the Giants
winning the Series.

541
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:56,041
We never won the Series,
so I wouldn't know.

542
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:57,145
THE NEXT INSANELY GOOD SPOT

543
00:27:57,743 --> 00:28:00,712
There must be a reason
we came all this way.

544
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:03,115
ASAHIKAWA
A SMALL CITY IN JAPAN

545
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,086
THE JAPANESE VERSION OF MOM'S COOKING

546
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,692
That's what I'm talking about!

547
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,894
If this place were near my home,
I'd come every day.

548
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:18,463
She's really good.

549
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:35,180
