1
00:00:01,702 --> 00:00:04,771
K-foodie meets J-foodie.

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,406
This is insane.

3
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:07,908
SEOUL, KOREA

4
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:12,679
We are at Eulji-ro.

5
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,781
-What? Eulji-ro?
-Eulji-ro.

6
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:18,252
Eulji-ro has long been known
for its old print shops.

7
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:20,587
-I see. No wonder…
-You can see them behind us.

8
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:22,556
Printing, editing, design…

9
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:25,058
I can smell the ink around here.

10
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,327
You recognize the smell of ink?

11
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:29,263
-Yes, I can smell the ink.
-Right.

12
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:32,165
Eulji-ro wasn't a place
young people used to go to.

13
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,769
It used to be an area for middle-aged men,

14
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:38,405
but recently it's become
a hot trend on social media.

15
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:39,606
INSANELY GOOD SPOT
HIPJI-RO

16
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,643
A lot of youngsters are gathering here.

17
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,077
Young people have been discovering

18
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:48,181
and visiting long-established shops.

19
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:51,919
So the middle-aged men of Eulji-ro
are like, "What? What's going on?"

20
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,387
It feels like

21
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:56,557
we're seeing young people here
for the first time in decades.

22
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,191
-Is this the place?
-Yes.

23
00:00:58,258 --> 00:00:59,293
It's here?

24
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,496
I actually brought my parents here once.

25
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,998
The entrance is not easy to find.

26
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,000
You really can't tell from just a glance.

27
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:12,105
It's not a shop you can easily find
just walking around.

28
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,408
For Japanese people, yes.
Shall we go in?

29
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:15,976
-Let's go inside.
-Let's go.

30
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:20,080
INSANELY GOOD HANDMADE DUMPLING KAL-GUKSU
EULJI KAL-GUKSU

31
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,152
Hello.

32
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:29,122
Hello.

33
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,558
-Have a seat.
-It's big inside.

34
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,327
-Hello. Excuse me.
-Hello.

35
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:38,565
EPISODE 37
TO MELT INTO THE KAL-GUKSU

36
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,870
They say it's been 33 years
since they opened.

37
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:49,610
It's run by a mother and her son.

38
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,411
-So a family business.
-A family business.

39
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,716
So I actually ended up liking kal-guksu.

40
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:56,883
Nice.

41
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,120
Kal-guksu with clean broth
is the basic option.

42
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:03,790
These days, kal-guksu
with pork broth is trending.

43
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,059
-But they use bone broth here.
-Bone broth.

44
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,427
And mugwort noodles.

45
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:10,430
-Mugwort?
-Yes.

46
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:12,232
It's green.

47
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:16,470
You have to taste it to know.

48
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,005
It's a unique kal-guksu.

49
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,940
So they have kal-guksu.

50
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:20,974
HANDMADE KAL-GUKSU

51
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,042
Dumpling kal-guksu.

52
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:23,176
HANDMADE DUMPLING KAL-GUKSU

53
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,244
And dumpling soup.

54
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,046
DUMPLING TTEOK-GUK

55
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:28,782
-Sounds interesting.
-How about dumpling kal-guksu?

56
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,518
It has three dumplings in it.

57
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:32,953
No, I just want the noodles.

58
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,589
-Just the noodles?
-I'll go with plain kal-guksu.

59
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:39,459
Then I'll order dumpling kal-guksu
and give you one dumpling.

60
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,428
Are we ordering the dumplings separately?

61
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,763
We could…

62
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:44,865
but their portions are huge.

63
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,266
Then it's a bit…

64
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:50,537
I'm Korean
and it's a bit much for me, too.

65
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:51,805
They're big, then?

66
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,774
-They are. Right.
-Like fist-sized?

67
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,442
Then let's order that.

68
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,545
We'll have one kal-guksu
and one dumpling kal-guksu.

69
00:02:58,612 --> 00:02:59,780
Okay.

70
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,315
Thank you.

71
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,451
She's great.

72
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,119
-Three dumplings, right?
-Right.

73
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,388
-There's no need to give us a lot.
-Okay.

74
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:09,756
Thank you.

75
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,894
Some places serve kal-guksu

76
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,863
boiling hot in a pot…

77
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,965
-There's something like that.
-And some places

78
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,501
serve them in individual bowls.

79
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:22,803
Some restaurants do that.

80
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,771
This one serves them separately.

81
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:27,708
Then it'd be okay to come here alone.

82
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:33,814
During the day, it's mostly
office workers coming in for lunch.

83
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,284
But at night, they sell pork belly.

84
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,419
-You can smell it.
-Yes.

85
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,323
-This must be the grill for pork belly.
-Exactly.

86
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,192
They light the fire here

87
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,661
and set it at an angle like this

88
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,163
-to let the oil drain.
-Right.

89
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,470
It's 17,000 won per serving.

90
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:57,871
-It's cheap.
-The pork belly.

91
00:03:57,938 --> 00:03:59,906
Meals are about 1,100 yen.

92
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:04,277
They actually raised the price recently.

93
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:07,347
Office workers eat lunch here,
so they're very sensitive about prices.

94
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:12,819
So in Korea too,

95
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,723
is 10,000 won
the standard limit for lunch?

96
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,525
Yes, it's kind of the threshold now.

97
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:21,261
Prices have gone up quite a bit.

98
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:25,732
For ordinary people, whether lunch costs

99
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,236
over 1,000 yen or not
feels like a big deal.

100
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,105
In Japan, there used
to be "500-yen lunches,"

101
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,974
but now you can't eat anywhere
for that price.

102
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,408
Right.

103
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,379
-Should we try the kimchi?
-Shall we?

104
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,181
-Thank you for the food.
-Go ahead.

105
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:43,483
-The kimchi is really good here.
-Kimchi?

106
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,153
They make it fresh every morning.

107
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,454
So it's fresh kimchi.

108
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,758
So it's salty and pretty spicy,

109
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:55,462
but when you put it in the broth,
it tastes amazing.

110
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,399
Fresh kimchi.

111
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:20,687
It's spicy.

112
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:21,955
It's so spicy.

113
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:23,557
But the broth

114
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:26,459
kind of balances out the spiciness.

115
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:31,364
The kimchi's great,

116
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,567
but it's quite spicy.

117
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:37,637
That's not something you see often.
You handle spice well.

118
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:38,605
And these…

119
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:42,042
-are their homemade chili pickles.
-Looks spicy.

120
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,643
It's pickled green chili.

121
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,179
People sometimes add it
to the noodles or the soup.

122
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:47,547
PICKLED GREEN CHILI

123
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:50,150
This one's not too spicy, actually.

124
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:56,756
It's really fragrant.

125
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,992
It goes great with the broth.

126
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:02,062
You can add a little at a time
to change the flavor.

127
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,167
And this is minced garlic seasoning.

128
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,903
MINCED GARLIC SEASONING

129
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,708
-It's got a strong garlic aroma.
-You'll have to brace yourself.

130
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,610
The garlic smell's going
to stick with you.

131
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,111
It's here.

132
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,113
-Who ordered dumplings?
-I did.

133
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,882
Wow, it's big.

134
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,250
Dumplings.

135
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,094
THREE HANDMADE DUMPLINGS INCLUDED

136
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:38,798
HANDMADE DUMPLING KAL-GUKSU
11,000 WON, 1,100 YEN

137
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,701
Thank you.

138
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,036
Enjoy.

139
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,872
HANDMADE KAL-GUKSU
11,000 WON, 1,100 YEN

140
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,341
What's the topping?

141
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,943
-Zucchini.
-Zucchini.

142
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,544
Zucchini?

143
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:52,646
And potatoes.

144
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,547
-And green onions.
-Yes.

145
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,852
SHARING A DUMPLING

146
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:03,256
Sorry, I'm not really used
to these chopsticks,

147
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:05,825
-so I'll use wooden chopsticks.
-Eat however you want.

148
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:08,728
Thank you for the food.

149
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:16,803
Okay.

150
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:21,641
It looks like pork broth.

151
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:22,943
It's actually beef bone broth.

152
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,423
The broth is good.

153
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,868
The broth is good.

154
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:52,973
It's great even just like this.

155
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,479
It feels like pork broth,

156
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:01,181
-but it's actually beef?
-Beef bone.

157
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:03,883
It was simmered for a long time.

158
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,721
And here's another thing.

159
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:11,191
-You can get unlimited broth refills.
-Oh, really?

160
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,193
"Could we have some more, please?"

161
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:18,131
-And these are mugwort noodles, right?
-Noodles.

162
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:33,013
It's probably a flavor
you haven't tried before.

163
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:36,783
It's kind of like udon, right?

164
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:46,559
But later, that mugwort aroma
hits your nose.

165
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,128
Right at the end.

166
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,330
It doesn't have any of that

167
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,465
grassy or raw taste at all.

168
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,633
It doesn't.

169
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:28,601
It might not be what you'd typically call
Korean kal-guksu,

170
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:33,673
but it's still a type of kal-guksu.

171
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,108
It's not common, though.

172
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:38,678
Noodles and broth like this are rare.

173
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,980
It's unique.

174
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:43,683
I get the charm of this.

175
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,752
-I might fall in love with this.
-I'm glad.

176
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,489
-Should I try the dumpling?
-Go ahead.

177
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,795
It's huge.

178
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:57,464
It's fist-sized.

179
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:14,781
This is good.

180
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,886
It's big, but the wrapper is thin.

181
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,355
So I think I'd be able to eat three.

182
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:28,962
The reason why I like their dumplings

183
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:30,730
is because they're honest. Simple.

184
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,667
These days, a lot of dumplings are greasy

185
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,236
or loaded with seasoning,

186
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,872
made to suit kids' tastes.

187
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,541
But real dumplings
are supposed to be light,

188
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:46,412
filled with good, clean ingredients

189
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,981
like tofu.

190
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,717
There's meat in this,
and these are chives, right?

191
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,018
Chives. Yes.

192
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,255
Maybe I'll tweak the flavor a bit.

193
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,323
Feel free to make it your own.

194
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:01,027
I usually add garlic.

195
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,831
I add garlic and pepper.

196
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:11,437
Try it. When you add garlic,
it changes like this.

197
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,113
Should I not add kimchi?

198
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,381
It's fine either way.

199
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:22,382
It's up to you.

200
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,717
Kimchi.

201
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,555
This changes the flavor drastically.

202
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,057
MINCED GARLIC SEASONING

203
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:36,162
PICKLED CHILI

204
00:11:56,316 --> 00:12:00,620
Beef bone broth
is more delicate than pork broth,

205
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:04,490
so even a small change in flavor
affects it a lot.

206
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,961
It's like being given a blank canvas.

207
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:11,431
You can freely paint whatever you'd like.

208
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,500
In the end, you get to improvise

209
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:18,504
and express your taste in your own bowl.

210
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,740
-That's what makes it fun.
-Right.

211
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:25,745
Exactly. Whether you eat it plain
or add things is all up to you.

212
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,747
Black pepper. Nice.

213
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,851
People often sprinkle pepper
on seolleongtang too.

214
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,754
It goes really well with bone broth.

215
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:38,858
It goes surprisingly well, actually.

216
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:54,140
Whenever I come here,
I just can't control myself.

217
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,445
-Could I have more broth?
-Sure.

218
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,349
-Does he like it?
-Yes. He loves it.

219
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,418
The broth is really good.

220
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:06,653
-He likes it.
-It's good.

221
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:07,754
Thank you.

222
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:13,559
Maybe I'll have some more broth, too.

223
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,439
This is…

224
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:28,274
This is just…

225
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,444
This broth really is perfect.

226
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,179
I'm glad to hear that.

227
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,049
When I first started studying Japanese,

228
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,551
I came across a beautiful expression.

229
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,086
When having things like miso soup,

230
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,821
you say, "It seeps in."

231
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:44,624
-"It seeps in."
-It seeps into your body,

232
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,225
little by little.

233
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,861
Let's see.

234
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:58,237
It seeps in.

235
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:01,974
If there was an IV fluid like this…

236
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,114
-It'd raise your blood pressure.
-Well…

237
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:10,416
Well… Yes.

238
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,820
Do places like this serve rice?

239
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,222
They do.

240
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:17,890
It's free.

241
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,292
Making something

242
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,395
like porridge out of this
would be great, too.

243
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,263
That sounds good.

244
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,805
The dumplings are good, too.

245
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,207
Want to split one?

246
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:36,309
No, I'm good.

247
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:38,044
Make your decision.

248
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,384
I'll cut it up for now.

249
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:51,657
A trick Korean people often use

250
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,360
is putting the dumplings in the soup
and breaking them apart.

251
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:57,797
Once you mash them a bit,
the broth changes flavor again.

252
00:14:57,864 --> 00:15:01,667
Then you add rice, mix it up,
and turn it into a kind of porridge.

253
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:05,738
STEP 1
ADD DUMPLINGS TO THE KAL-GUKSU

254
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,374
You mash them.

255
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:12,311
STEP 2
MASH THE DUMPLINGS

256
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:14,714
You add the rice.

257
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:17,617
STEP 3
ADD RICE

258
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:18,918
You turn it into a gukbap.

259
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:20,753
Got it.

260
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,922
That broth would be perfect

261
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,992
for gukbap, too.

262
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:29,562
Even the dumpling wrapper tastes different

263
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:33,966
when you have it steamed
and when it's softened

264
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,301
in the broth.

265
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:38,237
Can I eat this?

266
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:39,639
Go ahead.

267
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:41,841
I knew you'd eat it.

268
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:43,109
DUMPLING

269
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:45,144
RICE

270
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,648
I hope this isn't rude.

271
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:49,782
No, it's fine.

272
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:51,584
I do feel a bit guilty.

273
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,920
If someone did this in Japan,

274
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,255
they'd probably get scolded
for bad manners.

275
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,491
DONBURI: SCOOP UP AND EAT
SOBA: DIP AND EAT

276
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:01,594
IN JAPAN, MIXING FOOD
ISN'T REALLY PART OF THE CULTURE

277
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,796
BIBIMBAP: MIX
GUKBAP: PUT RICE INTO THE SOUP

278
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:06,933
IN KOREA, MIXING IS COMMON

279
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,368
In Korea, the mixing culture
is normal, right?

280
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:10,536
Yes. It's allowed.

281
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:16,209
MMM

282
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,579
MMM

283
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,354
It's good.

284
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:31,424
This is good.

285
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,360
MMM

286
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:38,431
So…

287
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,267
Adding dumplings

288
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,002
to regular mugwort kal-guksu,

289
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,504
mashing them, adding rice,

290
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,907
and mixing them all together
is really good.

291
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,978
Trying it definitely changed my mind.

292
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,145
That's good to hear.

293
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:55,314
This isn't on the menu.

294
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:58,251
-No. You make it yourself.
-Dumplings…

295
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,586
You order dumplings…

296
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,790
and have it with rice and broth.

297
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:11,264
That way, the dumpling skin becomes
a bit like wonton wrappers.

298
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,331
Right.

299
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,940
The broth just keeps getting
better and better.

300
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,476
Yes.

301
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:27,380
It keeps evolving,
even after it's on the table.

302
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,115
The broth.

303
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,017
-This is Korean culture.
-Yes.

304
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,631
It's good.

305
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:49,902
Eating it with rice is good.

306
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,064
You drank all the broth.

307
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:23,736
When you live alone,

308
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:27,974
you rarely get the chance to eat broth

309
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,308
made with this much care.

310
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,445
Broth made with such care

311
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,013
-is hard to get at home, too.
-Yes.

312
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,449
But my mom always loved cooking, so…

313
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,918
-Did she make broth, too?
-Everything.

314
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:40,686
I see.

315
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:44,023
That kind of care is a part of you now.

316
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,725
That's what it means to seep in.

317
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,260
-I see.
-Your mom's broth has seeped into you.

318
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,630
Her flavor, her care.

319
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:54,300
So when you crave something
that warms you up,

320
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:58,270
or when you want a good broth,

321
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,673
that broth fills your body and heart

322
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,476
thanks to your mother's cooking.

323
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:04,910
So it's all thanks to her.

324
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,814
Coming here is dangerous.

325
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:13,986
You can't stop.

326
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,125
Next time,

327
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:23,996
we should try the gukbap style.
Dumplings mashed into the broth with rice.

328
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:28,367
And if you add rice cakes to that,
it's basically a carb party.

329
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,369
No need to throw a party like that!

330
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:32,204
Rice cakes are good, too.

331
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,441
-Is that so?
-Should I order some?

332
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,442
NEXT INSANELY GOOD SPOT

333
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,410
