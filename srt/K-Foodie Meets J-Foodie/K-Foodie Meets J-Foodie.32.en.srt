AN ALL-ENCOMPASSING NAME FOR GRILLED LAMB

EPISODE 31
THE MASTER'S JINGISUKAN

4
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,809
K-foodie meets J-foodie.

5
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,511
This is insane.

6
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:47,881
TODAY'S FOODIE DESTINATION
SAPPORO, HOKKAIDO

7
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:51,552
HOKKAIDO
THE NORTHERNMOST REGION OF JAPAN

8
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,121
SAPPORO, HOKKAIDO

9
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:56,623
A CITY WHERE DIVERSE
INGREDIENTS COME TOGETHER

10
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,961
-Hokkaido.
-Sapporo, Hokkaido.

11
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:03,997
We've ended up at the far end of Japan.

12
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,868
Many Japanese films are…

13
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:11,772
-Hokkaido appears frequently.
-…set in Hokkaido.

14
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:15,342
So I came here at least once a year.

15
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:18,478
Hokkaido has a lot of delicious foods.

16
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:22,082
-Seafoods in the winter.
-And in summer…

17
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:27,554
If someone asks me what I'd want
to eat first when I come to Hokkaido,

18
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:29,856
I would say Jingisukan.

19
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:32,459
-I'm in.
-Lamb.

20
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:33,393
Let's go.

21
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,165
I've had different lamb dishes
in different places,

22
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:41,335
-but their lamb dish is really good.
-Is it here? Quequere?

23
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,570
Lamb House Quequere.

24
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:50,544
LAMB SPECIALTY RESTAURANT,
LAMB HOUSE QUEQUERE

25
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:52,813
Excuse me.

26
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,014
Welcome.

27
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,115
-Hello.
-Hello.

28
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:56,483
Hello. It's been a while.

29
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,285
-I remember you sat there…
-Yes.

30
00:01:58,352 --> 00:01:59,987
…with your family before.

31
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,321
-Excuse me.
-Thank you.

32
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:03,991
-Thank you.
-Come on in.

33
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,627
-He cooks it as a whole?
-As a whole.

34
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:09,463
I'll carve it for you.

35
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:11,365
-You carve it?
-Yes.

36
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,334
-Is that the thigh?
-Yes.

37
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:15,435
Please have a seat.

38
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:19,740
-I've been looking forward to seeing you.
-Thank you. Same here.

39
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,310
-I came here two years ago.
-Yes.

40
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:24,277
Two years ago.

41
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:29,016
It feels like I'm on a movie set.

42
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,818
This old carpet really sets the mood.

43
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,153
-Yes.
-These chairs, too.

44
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:46,600
REAL LAMB LEATHER

45
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:50,904
My father used to live in Hokkaido.

46
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:55,208
So I got to have a lot of lamb.

47
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,577
Whenever we had grilled meat
when I was younger,

48
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,846
it was mostly lamb.

49
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:03,350
I've had lamb in many places,

50
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:08,155
but I wanted to try
a more high-end version.

51
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,425
-How long have you been doing this?
-Thirty years.

52
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:12,993
-Thirty years?
-Yes.

53
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,996
Thirty years ago, Jingisukan wasn't

54
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:18,198
-all that famous in Japan either.
-Yes.

55
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:20,300
They all used mutton instead of lamb.

56
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,069
-Mutton.
-I see.

57
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:25,972
They started to switch to lamb
little by little 30 years ago.

58
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:30,343
LAMB: LESS THAN A YEAR OLD
BARELY HAS ANY ODOR

59
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,678
THE MEAT IS TENDER

60
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:34,915
MUTTON: OVER ONE YEAR AND SEVEN MONTHS OLD
HAS AN ODOR, MEAT IS TOUGH

61
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:39,486
-In the past, the smell was quite strong.
-It was strong?

62
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,689
-We ate it with soy sauce and garlic.
-Yes.

63
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,024
But not my family.

64
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,793
We had it with herbs and salt.

65
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,995
Was there a particular reason

66
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,165
you tried to do it that way 30 years ago?

67
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,968
In Europe,
I came across this kind of lamb,

68
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:57,871
and when I saw it, I thought,

69
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:01,208
"I want to go back to Japan
and cook something with this."

70
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,176
Europe is big.

71
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,512
Germany, Switzerland, and Sweden.

72
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:09,282
I worked at
a cheese fondue place in Switzerland.

73
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,887
After that, I was
in a place called Malmö in Sweden.

74
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:17,524
Since it had both mountains and the sea,
I cooked seafood dishes,

75
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:21,027
-and in winter, I made venison.
-You did everything.

76
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,763
I see.

77
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,733
-You lived quite a life.
-It's nothing, really.

78
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,603
-Do you eat lamb in Korea?
-Lamb.

79
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:33,507
These days, lamb skewers are popular.

80
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:34,975
Oh, you eat them as skewers.

81
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,477
It's Chinese style.

82
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,312
And lamb steak

83
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:44,017
has long been on the menus
of upscale hotel restaurants,

84
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:46,019
but it never really caught on.

85
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:49,489
The Sapporo-style Jingisukan trend
only started

86
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:53,193
-less than ten years ago.
-It's quite recent.

87
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,564
I don't mind it, but people have a hard
time with lamb that has a strong odor.

88
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,468
-Shall we order something?
-Let's.

89
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:03,870
I think he just started cooking
on his own.

90
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:05,405
-Yes.
-All of it.

91
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,407
What is lamb sashimi?

92
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,408
LAMB SASHIMI

93
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,377
Leave it to me. I'll carve this area up.

94
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,212
-You're carving up that area?
-Yes.

95
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,747
-Okay. We'll have the sashimi.
-Okay.

96
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,949
Right. And we have to order
the assorted vegetables.

97
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,484
ASSORTED VEGETABLES FOR GRILLING

98
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:21,321
-Would you like the veggies stir-fried?
-Yes.

99
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:23,657
There's a meat cut
from the same part, and you grill it…

100
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,425
-Yes.
-…for 20 seconds on each side.

101
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,693
-Twenty seconds?
-Twenty each.

102
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,161
-Twenty seconds.
-Yes.

103
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:30,330
-We'll have that first.
-Okay.

104
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:31,464
SASHIMI + LAMB FOR GRILLING

105
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,034
They even have thymus meat here.

106
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,236
-We had thymus at the yakiniku place.
-We did.

107
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:38,438
You haven't had cow thymus before, right?

108
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:42,142
They have lamb thymus, lamb liver,

109
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:45,178
lamb tongue, and spare rib.

110
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:47,581
-I want to try them.
-Okay!

111
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,648
MENU ORDER

112
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,817
LAMB SASHIMI
ASSORTED VEGETABLES

113
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,953
MEAT: LAMB THIGH, SPARE RIB

114
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,955
OFFAL CUTS: TONGUE, LAMB LIVER,
LAMB THYMUS

115
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:59,159
According to the supplier,
we're the only ones in Japan

116
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:03,330
who butcher Icelandic lamb
directly ourselves.

117
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:04,497
-I see.
-Yes.

118
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,266
That's how we can also serve sashimi.

119
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,703
Elsewhere, the distribution time
allows bacteria to develop.

120
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:13,106
But here, I butcher
the whole lamb myself on-site.

121
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:16,009
I never had lamb sashimi before.

122
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,345
REQUESTED HIS COOPERATION
TO FILM THE PROCESS

123
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,880
USUALLY DONE IN A SEPARATE AREA

124
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:30,657
Is there a specific cut used for sashimi?

125
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,992
Usually the loin cut.

126
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,527
-Loin cut.
-Loin cut,

127
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:39,165
or in our case, we use the thigh meat.

128
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:40,700
The thigh meat.

129
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:02,222
THIGH

130
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:05,358
LAMB SASHIMI, 12,900 WON, 1,290 YEN

131
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:08,828
-It's my first time trying this.
-I see.

132
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,563
Then I'll try first.

133
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,798
Please taste it first.

134
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,845
The meat itself is really good.

135
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:29,983
-The meat really doesn't have…
-You can't tell.

136
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,384
…any smell at all.

137
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,619
-Right?
-Yes.

138
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:35,922
Lamb doesn't have a strong smell at all,

139
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:39,592
-so I kept it simple and just used salt.
-I see.

140
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:43,563
So it's not off-putting at all,

141
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,599
and it even feels like it melts
in your mouth. It's wonderful.

142
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,437
I've never tasted anything like this.

143
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,372
It's salty,

144
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:56,076
but soft and sticky.

145
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,411
It feels very nice.

146
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,648
It feels like it's saying, "This
is what lamb is supposed to be like."

147
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:04,651
-This is good.
-It's good.

148
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:07,520
I could eat a lot of this.

149
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,289
Japanese people eat

150
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:11,891
-horse sashimi quite a lot.
-Yes.

151
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:15,261
It's better than horse.

152
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,298
It really doesn't smell.

153
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,266
It doesn't smell at all.

154
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,936
Because this Icelandic lamb
is a primitive breed

155
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:26,339
-brought over by the Vikings.
-Yes.

156
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:31,077
It hasn't been crossbred,
so it's the same as 200 to 300 years ago.

157
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:33,046
-So it's pure.
-Yes.

158
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,482
Like Japanese wagyu.

159
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,217
No cross-breeding.

160
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:43,223
So the breed is completely
different from Japan's Suffolk lamb.

161
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,225
It's different.

162
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,560
It's good.

163
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,530
This is what they call

164
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:52,799
-a Jingisukan grill pan.
-Right.

165
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,869
Do you have it in Korea?

166
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,904
We've been getting more of them recently.

167
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,172
-Really?
-In Korea, too.

168
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:02,242
People often misunderstand
what Jingisukan is

169
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,178
and think they'll find it
if they go to Mongolia.

170
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:07,113
-It's not in Mongolia.
-No.

171
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,649
-It started in Sapporo.
-Yes.

172
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:14,054
They say it was modeled after the helmet

173
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,089
-worn by Genghis Khan.
-It's similar, right?

174
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:19,526
THE JINGISUKAN GRILL PAN
ITS SHAPE RESEMBLES A MONGOLIAN HELMET

175
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:22,929
AND THE PREVAILING THEORY IS
THAT'S HOW IT GOT ITS NAME

176
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:32,806
There's Mount Fuji lava
embedded underneath.

177
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,941
-This?
-Yes.

178
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,177
There are holes in this,

179
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,246
and from those holes

180
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:43,983
far infrared rays come out,
so the meat cooks quickly.

181
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,819
-Mount Fuji lava.
-Lava.

182
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,187
-Lava, yes.
-It's a rock

183
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:48,221
of the lava.

184
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:50,256
Far infrared rays
come out of it, apparently.

185
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,426
Far infrared rays.

186
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:55,628
-So…
-These are the vegetables.

187
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:59,332
There's an opening
in the middle for grilling meat and…

188
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,134
-Yes.
-…you place the veggies around it.

189
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,636
-The vegetables look good.
-Right!

190
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:07,373
The raw vegetables take time to cook,
so there are always leftovers.

191
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,942
-I see.
-You can eat them right away.

192
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,176
-Now…
-Now?

193
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:12,612
Yes, you can eat the vegetables first.

194
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:16,950
This is the same thigh meat as before.

195
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,251
THIGH MEAT

196
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,820
THIGH MEAT, 12,900 WON, 1,290 YEN

197
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,288
Use the tongs

198
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,023
to spread the fat here,

199
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:28,061
-then grill each side for 20 seconds.
-Okay.

200
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,696
Then…

201
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:33,600
-One, two, three, four,
-Two, three, four,

202
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,368
-five, six…
-five, six,

203
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:36,936
-Twenty seconds, right?
-seven,

204
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,538
-eight, nine,
-Twenty seconds per side.

205
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,106
ten.

206
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,075
-One, two,
-One, two,

207
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,943
-three, four,
-three, four,

208
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,312
-I'll add one more to confuse him.
-five, six,

209
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,580
seven,

210
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,550
-One, two, three,
-eight, nine, ten.

211
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:52,986
One, two,

212
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,854
-three, four,
-three, four,

213
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,523
-five, six…
-five, six,

214
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,525
-One, two, three…
-seven…

215
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,393
Stop doing that!

216
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,896
Eight, nine, ten.

217
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,063
-All done.
-Done.

218
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,632
-Do we eat it just as is?
-Yes.

219
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:06,699
-Try the sauce.
-The sauce.

220
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,309
It's good.

221
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,482
-The sauce…
-It's good.

222
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,250
I…

223
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,386
I have never had
anything like this before.

224
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:29,923
This tastes completely different from
regular Jingisukan.

225
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,759
The more you chew,
the more the juices come out

226
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:36,863
with a really strong presence.

227
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,965
It's not the usual taste.

228
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,869
It's a deeper level of lamb flavor.

229
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:44,571
-This.
-Yes.

230
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:49,042
Unlike sashimi, grilling it
brings out more sweetness.

231
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:54,847
Sashimi is good, but this just
melts in your mouth.

232
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:59,886
-This has more meat than fat.
-Yes.

233
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,288
But the meat

234
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,958
isn't tough at all.

235
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,567
-Sir.
-Yes?

236
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:17,270
This sauce is really good.

237
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:21,541
It's a secret recipe

238
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:24,944
containing 30 different spices and herbs.

239
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:28,715
-It's a sauce.
-30 kinds of herbs.

240
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:45,098
We didn't wait 20 seconds
for the second one.

241
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,868
-The 20 seconds is the key.
-Right?

242
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,703
You can't grill it for too long.

243
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,175
I'm craving something fatty.

244
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,243
Right?

245
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,546
I wonder what cut that is.

246
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:05,318
Sir, which cut is next?

247
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:08,821
Next is the spare rib, where
the fat is especially delicious.

248
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,424
So that's what it looks like.

249
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:12,825
SPARE RIB

250
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,295
SPARE RIB, 14,100 WON, 1,410 YEN

251
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,963
-Sauce.
-I marinated the meat,

252
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,431
so you don't need any sauce.

253
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:20,767
-Just wrap it with tissue and eat it.
-Okay.

254
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,235
How long does it need to grill?

255
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,469
Three minutes on each side

256
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:26,939
-on the strongest heat.
-Okay.

257
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,575
-You do the spare rib, I'll do the rest.
-Okay.

258
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,478
Three minutes on each side.

259
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,783
Come to think of it, lamb is eaten a lot

260
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:40,887
-especially in northeastern China.
-Yes.

261
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,589
How come it never became popular in Korea?

262
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:47,827
Well, I guess it still feels
a bit unfamiliar.

263
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:51,597
Everyone knows that
lamb is good for the body

264
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:55,134
and even gives you
a sense of feeling healthier.

265
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:58,504
Lamb is my favorite kind of meat.

266
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:03,042
It's good for you and gives you energy,

267
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:06,212
especially since it doesn't leave you
feeling heavy.

268
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,381
The fat is different.

269
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:11,417
Beef fat can feel heavy.

270
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:12,852
-Yes.
-You feel like

271
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,955
you don't want any more,
even after just one serving.

272
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,391
But I can eat lamb forever.

273
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,228
This is…

274
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,598
It looks insane.

275
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:34,640
We have to dig into the ribs.

276
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:37,143
Don't dip it in anything.

277
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,811
It smells good.

278
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,601
It's either rice or beer.

279
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,270
-Right? With this?
-Yes.

280
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,072
-This…
-The fat is

281
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:09,175
really light and clean.

282
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:12,111
And it is salted very well.

283
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:18,451
Maybe it's because lamb fat
is so rich in umami,

284
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:21,020
-but it makes you want to have more.
-Yes.

285
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,170
The spare rib is good.

286
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,806
This is lamb tongue.

287
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:41,607
Lamb tongue?

288
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,342
Grill it for one minute on each side.

289
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:44,610
-One minute each?
-Yes.

290
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:46,345
Next is liver.

291
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,782
For liver, you can grill it
as long as you want.

292
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:53,252
It doesn't matter
if it's well done, medium, or rare.

293
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:56,355
Lastly, this is a cut

294
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,591
you only get a few milligrams of.

295
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,760
It's thymus meat.

296
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,962
-Thymus.
-Thymus. This is…

297
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:05,698
You'll have to cook
the thymus well, like the spare rib.

298
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:08,801
Grill it in the middle
for 2.5 minutes until it's well done.

299
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:12,004
-Well done?
-Make sure the moisture is all gone.

300
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,674
TONGUE, THYMUS, LIVER

301
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,711
OFFAL CUTS (PER AREA)
12,900 WON, 1,290 YEN

302
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,582
This is interesting.

303
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,851
We can't grill it all at once.

304
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:28,821
Tongue for 30 seconds.

305
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:32,024
-Grill the liver however we want.
-However we want. Let's put it on there.

306
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,530
-Here.
-Yes.

307
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,742
-I'll try this.
-I think you can go ahead.

308
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,878
-Liver.
-Liver.

309
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,357
-It's good, right?
-It's good.

310
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:05,591
The liver is good.

311
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,702
The tongue is good.

312
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:21,207
It's like I'm kissing a lamb.

313
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,883
I've never had tongue before.

314
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:31,884
-Really?
-Yes.

315
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:34,287
The tongue is good.

316
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:39,091
The balance between the fat
and the texture is excellent.

317
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,494
I'm not really sure

318
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:45,798
how to tell when the thymus

319
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,033
-is fully cooked.
-Right.

320
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,635
It should shrink to about
a third of its current size.

321
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:51,270
-A third? Okay.
-Yes.

322
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:54,707
-The longer you grill, the better.
-I see.

323
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,876
I will grill it as best as I can.

324
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:58,544
It's a lamb festival.

325
00:17:58,611 --> 00:17:59,512
You're right.

326
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,348
You get to taste different cuts.

327
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,622
The flavor is strong.

328
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,429
The liver is great.

329
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,010
It's hot in here.

330
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:33,279
-It's hot.
-It is.

331
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:36,315
-If I take this off…
-I should've taken this off.

332
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:38,818
We'd be like the white shirt brothers.

333
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:42,688
Will it be funny?

334
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:49,261
We're like a yakiniku team.

335
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:51,130
White lovers.

336
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:58,704
-The fat is good.
-It's good.

337
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:04,710
The more I eat it,
the more my appetite grows.

338
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,350
-The liver looks good.
-Liver.

339
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:14,754
I'll just grill one side

340
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:16,989
and eat it like this.

341
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,833
I'm going to need a nap after this.

342
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:30,069
-If you eat this?
-Yes.

343
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,937
Why?

344
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,407
Because I'm tired.

345
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:38,978
This requires a lot of stamina.

346
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,312
Just grilling it…

347
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,214
And it's hot.

348
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:45,217
Should I try the thymus?

349
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,519
-Sir?
-Yes?

350
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:47,720
Can we eat the thymus now?

351
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:48,721
Which one?

352
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:52,658
-Thymus.
-Yes, you can eat it.

353
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,927
Think of it like fish milt.

354
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:56,962
-Milt.
-It's like milt.

355
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,798
That's also a very rare cut.

356
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:05,337
Women love it.

357
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,141
-It's tender.
-Really?

358
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,576
It's tender.

359
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:12,344
We grilled it for so long,

360
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:13,913
but it's so tender.

361
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:17,717
You shouted that it's tender three times.

362
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:21,053
I can keep saying it
until I chew and swallow it.

363
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,788
It's tender.

364
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:25,891
-It's…
-I've never had this before.

365
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,932
-It's tender.
-Tender.

366
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:34,900
It's soft.

367
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:39,138
When you bite into it, the fat and juices

368
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:42,174
spread all through your mouth.

369
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,076
It's for intermediate levels.

370
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:45,544
It's not for beginners.

371
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,847
Honestly, like he said earlier,

372
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:51,083
it's for people who want
to explore lamb meat more deeply.

373
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,819
I wouldn't recommend it for beginners.

374
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:56,889
-Beginners can enjoy it too.
-Well…

375
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:58,657
Anyway,

376
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:01,160
in Korea, there aren't any places

377
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:04,263
where you can try
this many different cuts.

378
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:06,599
-Not yet.
-For lamb, right?

379
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:10,503
Cuts like these aren't sold
at Tokyo meat restaurants,

380
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:15,574
and eating lamb itself there feels like
something for a special occasion.

381
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:20,479
So if you've come all the way
to Sapporo in Hokkaido,

382
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:23,816
I think it's best to experience something

383
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:26,952
you could never have in Tokyo.

384
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,821
So you should come to places like this.

385
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:30,923
Since it's not easy
to come all the way here.

386
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,625
We can't have this in Tokyo.

387
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:37,029
Because the owner is only here.

388
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:41,200
MEANWHILE, THE OWNER IS BUSY
COOKING UP ANOTHER DISH

389
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,102
I think he's already done.

390
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:45,371
We can really see his Western-style…

391
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:46,639
-Yes.
-…cooking skills here.

392
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:50,276
Refined through experience
in three European countries.

393
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,711
TEN MINUTES AGO

394
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,849
-Sir.
-Yes.

395
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,919
I want to try the lamb hamburg steak

396
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,087
since it made such an impression
on me last time.

397
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,491
It's good, right?
After butchering the whole lamb,

398
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:08,394
I mince the leftover meat to make it.

399
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,428
I see.

400
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,964
-I'll grill it for you.
-Really? It's one of my favorites.

401
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:13,566
I'll grill it for you now.

402
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:15,201
Should we order rice, too?

403
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:18,070
They have lamb meat tomato risotto.

404
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:20,673
-I want to try it.
-Okay.

405
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,092
-Thank you.
-This is the finishing touch.

406
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,228
It's too elegant to be
the finishing touch.

407
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:47,600
RISOTTO + LAMB HAMBURG STEAK
13,800 WON, 1,380 YEN

408
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:51,237
-The finishing touch.
-The hamburg steak looks so good.

409
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:54,874
I used the leftover meat
of what you just had to make them.

410
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:57,109
It's pure lamb itself.

411
00:22:58,577 --> 00:22:59,511
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

412
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:00,512
Okay.

413
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,415
It's hot.

414
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,719
Look over here.

415
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:14,093
It's soft.

416
00:23:26,205 --> 00:23:30,509
-It's good.
-I really wanted to have this.

417
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:34,413
I might come to Sapporo just for this.

418
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,817
-This is good.
-It's good.

419
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:42,421
-It's good.
-I don't know how to describe the flavor.

420
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:44,456
Wow. This is killer.

421
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,025
-It's good.
-It's good!

422
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,426
So good, right?

423
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:51,563
It's really good.

424
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,004
It's good.

425
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,040
Good, right?

426
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:04,977
There's a hint of cheese,

427
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:07,780
and then the lamb flavor hits you later.

428
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,648
It's exquisite.

429
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:11,550
Wow, it's really good.

430
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:13,619
How much is it?

431
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:15,754
The hamburg steak is 850 yen.

432
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:18,824
THREE LAMB HAMBURG STEAKS (150G)
8,500 WON, 850 YEN

433
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:21,293
The risotto is 530 yen.

434
00:24:21,694 --> 00:24:23,896
LAMB MEAT TOMATO RISOTTO
5,300 WON, 530 YEN

435
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,931
Isn't it too cheap?

436
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:28,634
It's a brutal price.

437
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:31,236
-It's insane.
-You'll regret it

438
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,239
-if you don't have this before leaving.
-Right.

439
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,241
You have to eat it at the end.

440
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,445
-Don't come if you won't eat this.
-Don't come?

441
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:42,781
You make this all by yourself
in one kitchen.

442
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:44,450
-Unbelievable.
-Amazing. Unbelievable.

443
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:47,286
-You have to make a reservation.
-It's a must.

444
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:48,587
A reservation is a must.

445
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,522
How many tables do you take?

446
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:54,960
I can handle three tables
and these three seats here.

447
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:57,329
-So six tables.
-Yes.

448
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:59,865
Taking more than that
would inconvenience the customers,

449
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:01,633
so I turn them all down.

450
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:05,437
I want to stay here

451
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,874
and try the other dishes as well.

452
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:12,845
It would be amazing
if I can just find out this recipe

453
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:16,749
and make it myself.

454
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:21,120
Let's say my girlfriend

455
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,888
cooked lamb at home.

456
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:27,593
If she made
this hamburg steak and risotto,

457
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,765
I'd marry her.

458
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:35,601
I would fall for her right away.

459
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,436
-Really?
-Yes.

460
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,806
If she cooks this for me every day…

461
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,742
I feel like I need a glass
of red wine right now.

462
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:46,478
It feels like it turned
into a luxurious date.

463
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,714
Would you like a glass of wine?

464
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:50,983
-Red wine, please.
-Okay.

465
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,885
-I have to have a drink.
-Yes.

466
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,458
-Thank you.
-It is red wine

467
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:01,593
that goes well with the lamb.

468
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,296
What is this thing that looks like a bell?

469
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:06,598
I bought it at a flea market in Paris.

470
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,935
-Cute.
-Cute, right?

471
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,276
This is really good.

472
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:23,048
This is insane.

473
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:30,656
Does it go well with the lamb?

474
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:33,025
-Very well.
-That's good.

475
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:36,662
This is amazing,
and the wine is so good, too.

476
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:39,531
I don't know much about Japan,

477
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,000
and being Korean, I try to be modest.

478
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,471
But this is something
not only Korean viewers

479
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:49,975
but also Japanese viewers who love lamb

480
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:52,845
really should come and try.
Come try the lamb risotto.

481
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:57,249
Even people who don't like lamb

482
00:26:57,683 --> 00:26:59,585
would probably enjoy it,

483
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:03,222
mistaking it for a regular,
delicious hamburg steak.

484
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:05,958
Even if you tell them it's lamb,

485
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:09,428
they'd definitely go,
"Lamb can taste this good?"

486
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:13,165
I think if I were stuck
on a deserted island

487
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:17,469
and was forced to eat this
for three years, I could do it.

488
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:19,905
Me too. I think I could do five years.

489
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:23,108
With wine, I could do seven years.

490
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:24,643
NEXT INSANELY GOOD SPOT

491
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,245
Wow, it's been a while, Dae-ho.

492
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:35,220
K-foodie meets J-foodie meets K-foodie.

493
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:36,622
This is insane.
