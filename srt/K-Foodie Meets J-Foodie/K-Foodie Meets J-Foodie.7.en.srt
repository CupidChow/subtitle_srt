1
00:00:01,969 --> 00:00:05,038
LAST TIME IN TOKYO

2
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:07,908
I come here all the time.
I want you to start first.

3
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:08,842
Sure.

4
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,615
MATJJIGAE INTRODUCED
TOKYO'S INSANELY GOOD SPOTS

5
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:16,783
Korea has great restaurants,
but where should we go?

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,285
Korea-Japan taste exchange project.

7
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:19,319
PART TWO

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,955
FROM JAPAN TO KOREA

9
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:23,524
MATJJIGAE HAS ARRIVED!

10
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:27,060
SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA

11
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:32,933
Let's begin the South Korea segment.

12
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,334
We're finally in Seoul.

13
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,870
-Thanks for coming.
-I'm looking forward to it.

14
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:38,705
We are at Yeongdeungpo Station.

15
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,107
-Yeongdeungpo?
-Right.

16
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:43,176
-It's where business, transportation…
-Okay.

17
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:45,612
-…and culture come together.
-I see.

18
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,016
It's a hub where it all blends together.

19
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:49,983
Exactly.

20
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:53,921
-There's even a stylish department store.
-That's right.

21
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:56,557
-You've got a tourist guidebook.
-I mean…

22
00:00:56,623 --> 00:01:00,260
I don't know where to find good food.

23
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:02,462
-Let me handle it.
-I brought it just in case.

24
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,264
-I'll leave it to you.
-Okay, but…

25
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,233
everything we had in Japan was fantastic.

26
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,168
-Don't flatter me too much.
-It's true.

27
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:11,905
I know Korea has so many
amazing dishes. It's truly surprising.

28
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:12,973
You're already smiling.

29
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,442
-That's right.
-I was the same in Japan.

30
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,644
-I couldn't help but smile.
-Right?

31
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:20,447
-I've put together a list of restaurants.
-All right.

32
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:23,296
-I did some research and ate a ton.
-Great.

33
00:01:23,796 --> 00:01:27,521
SI-KYUNG PERSONALLY SCOUTED OUT

34
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:30,190
AND ARRANGED SIX AMAZING RESTAURANTS

35
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,225
-Korean barbecue is mostly pork?
-Marinated pork ribs.

36
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,393
AUTHENTIC PORK RIBS

37
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:34,628
I never had cold noodles

38
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:36,163
-that wowed me.
-Leave it to me.

39
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,264
SI-KYUNG'S GO-TO COLD NOODLES

40
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,832
I love walnut balls.

41
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,535
-There's one near Yaksu station.
-Where?

42
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:42,636
TRADITIONAL MARKET SWEETS

43
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,414
K-foodie meets J-foodie.

44
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:55,916
It's insane.

45
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:00,287
What's trending in Korea?

46
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:03,023
-Trends in Korea…
-Yes?

47
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,292
-Rise and fall quickly?
-Yes.

48
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:08,195
-There's so much to eat now.
-I see.

49
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,931
-So many options.
-Right, it wasn't like that before.

50
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:13,100
Interesting. What's this?

51
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,335
-What?
-They're not cooking rabbits, are they?

52
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,604
-No, not at all.
-Right?

53
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:20,073
-I hope not.
-It's just their mascot.

54
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,708
-A mascot?
-It's an izakaya.

55
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,411
-I was born in the year of the rabbit.
-Right.

56
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,413
So don't make me eat rabbits.

57
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,615
-We don't eat rabbits here.
-I really can't.

58
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,551
-There are little pigs on the sign.
-It's a gamja-tang place.

59
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,920
-Gamja-tang?
-Yes, pork back-bone stew.

60
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,122
Oh.

61
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:37,157
-It looks good.
-There is a lot of variety here.

62
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:38,792
And they're open 24 hours.

63
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:39,726
OPEN 24 HOURS

64
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,161
-What?
-Yes, 24 hours.

65
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,996
-Even at midnight?
-Right.

66
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,264
Wow.

67
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,100
-What about here?
-It's a pork barbecue place.

68
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,035
Is it?

69
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,037
A Hong Kong-style pub.

70
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,339
-So they sell Chinese food?
-Yes.

71
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:53,573
-What's this?
-It's dak-kalbi.

72
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,608
SPICY STIR-FRIED CHICKEN

73
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,943
It's probably too early for them to open.

74
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,079
-Is this a beef place?
-It seems like…

75
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:00,480
-Well…
-Is that common?

76
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,382
I feel like I'm taking

77
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,017
-a little boy around.
-Exactly.

78
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:08,088
How many times would Koreans
eat samgyeopsal, pork belly, in a month?

79
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,189
Take a look around.

80
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:12,526
-Samgyeopsal here, samgyeopsal there.
-Yes, I see.

81
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:16,363
Koreans eat samgyeopsal pretty often.

82
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,531
I see.

83
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:19,466
-Not today, though.
-Okay.

84
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:23,103
-We're having dwaeji-kalbi, pork ribs.
-Sounds great.

85
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,838
-It's an established place…
-Okay.

86
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,973
-…that I've known for a long time.
-Really?

87
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,542
-Yes.
-Since when?

88
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:31,812
Quite a while.
It's a long-standing restaurant.

89
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:34,448
-I smell something delicious.
-Should we go in?

90
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:35,849
-Is it nearby?
-It's right here.

91
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,185
That looks amazing.

92
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:39,820
BU-IL CHARCOAL GRILLED RIBS

93
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,588
IN BUSINESS FOR 30 YEARS

94
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,057
-I love old restaurants.
-I do too.

95
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:45,325
BU-IL KALBI

96
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,160
It has a good vibe.

97
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,629
-I can see something already.
-It's too cold.

98
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,498
-That's charcoal.
-I see.

99
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,334
-They're preparing it over there.
-That is impressive.

100
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:58,672
-They're making charcoal.
-It smells great.

101
00:03:58,772 --> 00:03:59,973
Oh, my.

102
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,877
Just by the vibe here,

103
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:05,445
I can tell it'll be great.

104
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:06,513
EPISODE 7

105
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,948
THE DIGNITY OF A 30-YEAR-OLD
LEGENDARY RESTAURANT

106
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,082
BU-IL CHARCOAL GRILLED RIBS

107
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:10,884
-Let's go inside.
-All right.

108
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:16,990
It smells amazing!

109
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:20,060
-Right?
-It smells incredible.

110
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,629
This place must be good.

111
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,664
What an amazing smell.

112
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:29,136
The smell of the meat
has seeped into the walls.

113
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,904
-Welcome.
-Hello.

114
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:33,840
-It looks tasty.
-Thank you.

115
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,509
Thanks for letting us film here.

116
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,844
STARING

117
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:40,447
Please take a seat here.

118
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:41,982
It looks so good!

119
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:45,585
-Hello.
-Hello.

120
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:49,756
Would you like to order?

121
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:53,860
-Can we get two orders of dwaeji-kalbi?
-Coming right up.

122
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,862
Two dwaeji-kalbi for this table!

123
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,330
-Okay.
-And two seasoned leafy greens.

124
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:58,532
The thing is,

125
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:03,236
there are a lot of fancy
grilled pork ribs places these days, but…

126
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:05,071
I feel like it isn't something

127
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,606
you eat at a fancy place.

128
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,275
-Is it?
-I don't think so.

129
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:09,743
It should be eaten

130
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,345
-in a place that smells like meat.
-Right.

131
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,048
-It's just better.
-It's the same with yakiniku.

132
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:18,151
If the smell is ingrained in the place…

133
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:20,453
-I agree.
-…the meat tastes better.

134
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,624
Yakiniku places in Japan serve
different kinds of meats, right?

135
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:27,894
-Yeah. Beef, pork…
-Intestines, chicken, even sausages,

136
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,130
beef, and lamb.

137
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:32,365
-Here, the menu is… Where is it?
-Yes?

138
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,767
-Over there.
-That's all they have.

139
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,069
-Just 300 grams of dwaeji-kalbi.
-Right.

140
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:37,170
LOCALLY SOURCED

141
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:39,539
-It's 19,000 won for 300 grams.
-Right.

142
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:40,941
-That's cheap.
-About 1,900 yen.

143
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,210
-Only 1,900 yen for 300 grams?
-Yes.

144
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,011
-Wow.
-Also,

145
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:49,449
dwaeji kkeopdegi, pork rinds,
comes at no extra charge.

146
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:50,450
-It's free?
-Yes.

147
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,053
-The stew is complimentary too.
-No kidding.

148
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:55,522
-All of this is free, refills are free.
-Okay.

149
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:58,925
-No way.
-There's a side dish corner.

150
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,795
-What?
-You can take as much as you like.

151
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,065
-It's a steal.
-Even spicy marinated crab

152
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,634
-is unlimited.
-That's generous.

153
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,469
Can they break even?

154
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:13,039
-They've been doing it this way for years.
-That's amazing.

155
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,774
What are pork rinds like?

156
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,343
-Haven't you ever tried them?
-No.

157
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,478
Good, they're really tasty.

158
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:21,081
-I see.
-So…

159
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,316
-We checked with the store…
-Okay.

160
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,353
-…and got you a non-alcoholic beer.
-Yes! I'm so happy.

161
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,256
-There you go.
-Thanks.

162
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:32,759
-I'll drink some regular, adult beer.
-Please, go ahead.

163
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,794
-Can we get a bottle of beer?
-Sure.

164
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:36,496
"Sure."

165
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,733
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

166
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,803
-Welcome to Korea.
-I'm so glad I'm here.

167
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:45,405
This is great for our first spot.

168
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,510
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

169
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:54,180
-Thank you.
-My first meal here in Korea.

170
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,382
-Cheers.
-I can't wait.

171
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,254
It's good.

172
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:06,726
-Wow.
-Delicious.

173
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:07,827
CHARCOAL ARRIVES

174
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:10,130
-The charcoal's here. It's warm.
-That's good.

175
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,532
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

176
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:15,735
-It's warm.
-Meat tastes best

177
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,304
-when grilled over charcoal.
-I agree.

178
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:19,372
-I'll put the grill on first.
-Thank you.

179
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:20,674
-So that it'll heat up.
-Okay.

180
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,808
HERE COMES THE GRILL

181
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,743
FOLLOWED BY THE RIBS

182
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,912
TWO SERVINGS OF DWAEJI-KALBI,
MARINATED PORK RIBS

183
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,747
38,000 WON, AROUND 3,800 YEN

184
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:28,815
That's big!

185
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,085
He really loves it.

186
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:34,054
-Let me grill this for you…
-Okay.

187
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,357
…so the meat won't burn,
and the juices will stay in.

188
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:38,491
-Okay.
-Yes.

189
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,594
I'll grill it the way
I always do for my guests.

190
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,229
-Thank you.
-Okay.

191
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:45,899
-You sounded so serious.
-No, I didn't mean to be.

192
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,067
-It's…
-I thought you were

193
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,002
-talking about a diplomatic issue.
-Not at all.

194
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:55,809
-Is this the rib cut?
-Which part is it?

195
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:56,743
INTERPRETING

196
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,511
-This is ribs.
-She said ribs.

197
00:07:58,578 --> 00:07:59,546
-Right here.
-Yes.

198
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:03,283
You grill the whole thing like this.

199
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,217
Oh…

200
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:06,920
In Japan, meat is usually served
in small pieces.

201
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:10,023
-I've never seen a piece this big.
-That's probably true.

202
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:15,595
IN JAPAN, MEAT IS SERVED PRE-CUT
INTO BITE-SIZED PIECES

203
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:20,133
IN KOREA, MEAT IS GRILLED WHOLE, THEN CUT

204
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,102
In most dwaeji-kalbi places,

205
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:25,138
-they grill first, cut, then grill again.
-We grill first…

206
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,474
The grilling method is totally different.

207
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,211
-Also, the fire's a bit strong right now…
-Is that radish?

208
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:32,345
-So I'll…
-It's radish.

209
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:35,648
…stick this right here
to keep the meat from burning.

210
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,884
-Just like this.
-Are you using it as a cushion?

211
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:42,122
-It's used to temper the heat.
-Okay, I get it.

212
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,590
I feel sorry for the radish.

213
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,429
WHEN THE MEAT IS COOKED ENOUGH

214
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,966
IT'S CUT INTO BITE-SIZED PIECES

215
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:58,471
AND ROLLED ON THE GRILL
TO BE COOKED THROUGH

216
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,711
-Here, try some.
-It's done!

217
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:05,845
-Thanks.
-Dip it first.

218
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,614
-Can I eat it now?
-Please try it.

219
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,783
-I'll dig in.
-Just with the sauce at first.

220
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,104
Is this…

221
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,607
-really pork?
-Yeah, it is.

222
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,976
This is better than beef.

223
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,846
It's amazing. Seriously.

224
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,816
-This is incredible.
-Yes!

225
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,353
I like pork fat.

226
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:52,759
The pork fat, charcoal,
and this slightly sweet sauce…

227
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:58,698
I've never had a sauce
that goes so perfectly with pork before.

228
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,333
-I'm glad to hear that.
-I mean it.

229
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,236
This sauce surprised me.

230
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,672
-Is it okay? Is it delicious?
-Amazing.

231
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,273
-I mean…
-It's so good.

232
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,875
-Is it?
-Yes, it is.

233
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,877
Oh, thank you.

234
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,113
She said "thank you" in a dialect.

235
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:15,315
-Go-map-seubnidei?
-It's not "go-map-seubnida."

236
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,283
-Go-map-seubnidei.
-Go-map-seubnidei.

237
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,489
-It's delicious.
-Try more meat.

238
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:27,393
I can't stop. I could eat this forever.

239
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,429
See? No burnt spots.

240
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:30,797
Mmm!

241
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:39,038
Try it with some lettuce salad.

242
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,281
Mmm!

243
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:50,984
The salad is also good.

244
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,152
-Isn't it delicious?
-It is!

245
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,354
-It's fresh too.
-Right.

246
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:06,032
-Mmm!
-It's really good.

247
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,201
It's clear.

248
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,637
-You've got skills.
-Of course, I'm experienced.

249
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:14,174
I've been doing this for a long time.

250
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,442
I always get compliments from customers.

251
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,377
STARING

252
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,512
-This…
-Her badge is cute, the smiley face.

253
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,381
He says your name tag is cute.

254
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:22,916
-Oh, this?
-Yes.

255
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,185
-It's cute.
-I'm wearing this for a reason.

256
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,586
-I…
-She's telling us the reason.

257
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:27,520
INTERPRETING

258
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:29,622
We didn't have name tags before.

259
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,992
-She didn't wear it before.
-I say hi to customers all the time.

260
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,328
-When she greeted customers…
-But when I don't wear it,

261
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,764
people think I'm a peddler selling gum

262
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,233
-and tell me to go away.
-They thought she was selling gum.

263
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,002
-That's why I had this made.
-I see.

264
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,804
-So she had it made.
-No way.

265
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,839
-What about that one?
-What's this badge?

266
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,274
-The red one.
-This? A smile.

267
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:50,310
-Yes.
-It's nice to smile.

268
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,045
-"It's nice to smile."
-That's right.

269
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,347
-It doesn't mean much.
-Smile, smile.

270
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:56,883
-What's that down there, a charm?
-The…

271
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,917
WHAT'S THE RED POUCH?

272
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:59,385
-This?
-Is this a charm?

273
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,254
No, it's not a charm.

274
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:02,422
Look.

275
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,557
DING-DONG

276
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:05,491
Yes?

277
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,329
When I press the button,
it sends an alarm.

278
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:12,232
So it rings.

279
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:17,303
-It's not a charm.
-I thought it was.

280
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,404
That's her number?

281
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:19,372
THE OWNER'S NUMBER

282
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,941
I could move around quickly,

283
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,876
but that's when I was young.
Now I'm older.

284
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,346
-My legs hurt.
-When she was young…

285
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,280
INTERPRETING

286
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,449
…she was able to move quickly.

287
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,751
-I can't anymore.
-But she's slower now.

288
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:33,753
-Yeah.
-So she rings it when she needs something.

289
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,222
That was unexpected.

290
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:39,692
I think this will go well with rice.

291
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:42,028
Is there rice here?

292
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:43,263
There is.

293
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,232
-One rice, please.
-Okay.

294
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,638
-Thank you.
-Hello.

295
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,307
-Thank you.
-Sure thing.

296
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,009
-Be careful, it's hot.
-Enjoy.

297
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,878
-Dip the meat in the sauce.
-Rice!

298
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,381
-And?
-Try it with some rice.

299
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,450
Try it. It'll taste good.

300
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,387
-Eat it with rice.
-Japswobwa.

301
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,656
-It means, "Try it."
-Japswobwa.

302
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,724
Ah, it's delicious!

303
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:16,863
-Is it?
-Yes, it's really good.

304
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:20,033
-That's a relief.
-This rice though!

305
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,100
Mmm!

306
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,338
-The good thing about dwaeji-kalbi…
-Yes.

307
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:29,342
As you said at the yakitori place,
yakitori goes well with alcohol,

308
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,711
-but not with rice.
-Yakitori is different.

309
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,780
This goes well with both.

310
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,483
-Right, I see.
-You can order rice for the kids…

311
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,585
-I can see that.
-…and for adults…

312
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,655
-It's for all ages.
-Exactly.

313
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,824
-It's Korea's signature dish.
-Korean soul food.

314
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,993
Something's coming.

315
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,629
The doenjang-jjigae is on the house.

316
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:52,365
CHADOL DOENJANG-JJIGAE:
BRISKET SOYBEAN PASTE STEW (0 WON, 0 YEN)

317
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,367
What kind of jjigae is this?

318
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:59,972
It's a soybean paste stew
with chadol, a cut of beef.

319
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:04,110
It has various ingredients, like zucchini.

320
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,150
How is it?

321
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,553
-It's delicious, no kidding.
-I'm glad.

322
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,122
I'm not familiar with this cut.

323
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,859
It's called chadol,
a specific part of the brisket.

324
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:22,128
You don't eat this cut
as much in Japan, right?

325
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,430
I don't recall having it.

326
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:26,799
Next time, let's visit
a chadol specialty place.

327
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,836
-There's a specialty place?
-Yes, it's delicious.

328
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,405
-Mr. Matjjigae.
-Yes?

329
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:34,974
-I've been calling you Mr. Matjjigae.
-Yes.

330
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:39,345
I referred to you
as Big Bro Matjjigae on my Instagram

331
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:40,913
-without asking.
-It's fine.

332
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,949
-Can I call you that?
-Big Bro is good.

333
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,484
-It's okay.
-Big Bro Matjjigae.

334
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,252
-Also, for Matjjigae…
-Yes.

335
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:47,487
-…Mat means taste.
-Okay.

336
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,489
-Jjigae means stew in Korean.
-Jjigae.

337
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:53,526
-So it works perfectly.
-Big Bro Matjjigae, I like that.

338
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,329
-You can call me Si-kyung.
-Si-kyung chan?

339
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,930
-Si-kyung.
-Si-kyung chan.

340
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,298
In Korean, it's just Si-kyung.

341
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,101
-Si-kyung…
-Si-kyung-a, or Si-kyung-i.

342
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,203
-Si-kyung-i?
-Yes.

343
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,505
It's Si-kyung-i.

344
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:06,973
-Si-kyung-i.
-That's it.

345
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,908
Can I remember this? Was it Si-kyung-i?

346
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,643
Actually, it's Si-kyung-a.

347
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:12,578
-Si-kyung-a.
-It means "Hey, Si-kyung."

348
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,915
When you address someone,
and their name ends with a consonant…

349
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:17,383
It's hard. It's a grammar issue.

350
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,218
Can't I just call you Si-kyung chan?

351
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,853
Let's just go with Si-kyung chan.

352
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,956
It's easier for me.

353
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,426
I can't control Big Bro Matjjigae.

354
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,235
-That's nice, with perilla leaves.
-Yes.

355
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,839
MAKING A SSAM LIKE SI-KYUNG DOES

356
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,916
-You can add onions if you like.
-Onions.

357
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,786
You should wrap your ssam tightly.

358
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,888
Nice and tight like this…

359
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,528
-Do I make it round?
-Yes.

360
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,730
-And I eat the whole thing?
-Yes, in one go.

361
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:16,576
It's delicious.

362
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,546
-We've been eating ssam for centuries.
-Okay.

363
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:23,683
-Since the Three Kingdoms period…
-Yeah.

364
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:26,786
…Koreans have enjoyed wrapping
various foods in vegetables.

365
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,889
-Even with kelp, seaweed, and dried laver.
-As wrappers.

366
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:32,725
-Since there are so many kinds of veggies…
-Right.

367
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,862
…there are various types of wraps too.

368
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:38,064
-I see.
-It's also good for your health.

369
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,467
-When you get close to someone in Korea…
-Yes?

370
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:44,804
…you make a wrap and feed each other.

371
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,906
Oh… I'll pass on that.

372
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,644
-Do you mean it?
-Yes.

373
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,578
That's disappointing.

374
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:56,249
Everyone has preferences.

375
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:59,085
-You leave it up to the other person.
-I'm not sure about that…

376
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,789
-You wrap it well like this…
-Okay.

377
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,526
-…and say, "Ah."
-"Ah"? There's no way I'm doing that.

378
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,701
Fine. Si-kyung, have a bite.

379
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,842
I guess we're not that close yet.

380
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,444
I want to try this one.

381
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,147
-The spare ribs.
-It's not done.

382
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,081
Is it not done?

383
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,685
-Can I eat the bony part?
-It's not fully cooked.

384
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:33,619
-Still?
-Yes.

385
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,820
What about this?

386
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,389
-Give it more time.
-Okay.

387
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:38,491
What about this one?

388
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:41,561
-You're a bit impatient.
-What?

389
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,398
Is this still not ready?

390
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,533
-It's quite raw.
-All right.

391
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,101
-Please wait.
-How do you know?

392
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,836
Most Koreans know how to grill meat.

393
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,373
Since Korean barbecue
is usually a DIY experience,

394
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,375
everyone develops their own technique.

395
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,044
-Okay.
-In Korea,

396
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,479
the juniors usually
take charge of the grill

397
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,682
-rather than the seniors.
-Okay.

398
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,383
WAITING WITH CHOPSTICKS IN HAND

399
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,385
Him waiting with chopsticks is too…

400
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:10,790
Can I eat it now?

401
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,391
Let it cool off a little.

402
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,859
-It's hot.
-Okay.

403
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,128
I wanted to bite into this.

404
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,971
-How is it?
-It's nice.

405
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:26,138
This is good stuff.

406
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:35,181
Didn't you have dwaeji-kalbi
in the Korea episode of Solitary Gourmet?

407
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:36,849
-I did.
-In that episode,

408
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,385
-you said, "I am a lone black panther."
-That's right.

409
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,428
The meat around the bone is the best.

410
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:58,170
Right now, I'm a black panther in Seoul.

411
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,206
Grrr!

412
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,709
A BLACK PANTHER

413
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:04,977
Grrr!

414
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,413
Grrr!

415
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:09,949
Grrr!

416
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:15,087
Right now, I'm a black panther in Seoul.

417
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,296
I'm turning into a beast.

418
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:26,766
Grrr!

419
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:29,168
I'm glad you like it.

420
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:35,141
Is the owner preparing pork rinds?

421
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:36,609
Yes.

422
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,911
-Can I go and see it for a moment?
-Of course.

423
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:41,681
Are these the rinds?

424
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,183
-The rinds.
-They're pork rinds.

425
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,786
-Wow.
-This is on the house.

426
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,488
It looks interesting.
I've never seen it before.

427
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,991
-This is for your table.
-Do we grill it over there?

428
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:54,326
-Do you want it now?
-Yes, please.

429
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,029
-Let's go.
-Okay.

430
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:58,831
This is my first time…

431
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,867
seeing pork rinds.

432
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,703
-One bottle of soju, please.
-Sure.

433
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,571
It's here.

434
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,244
-This is thicker than I expected.
-Cook them well before you eat.

435
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,747
PORK RINDS (0 WON, 0 YEN)

436
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:17,817
Not all places that serve pork ribs
give this for free, right?

437
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:22,555
Most do serve pork rinds,
but they don't offer it for free nowadays.

438
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,023
-I have a question.
-Okay.

439
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,024
What is this?

440
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:29,028
This is ground soybean.

441
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:30,129
Soybean powder.

442
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,765
-What do you do with it?
-You coat the pork rinds with it.

443
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,734
-Coat the rinds with it?
-Yes.

444
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,036
-No way.
-It softens them and adds a savory flavor.

445
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:38,504
Interesting.

446
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:40,272
Coating pork rinds with soybean powder…

447
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:43,542
-That's the good stuff.
-I can't imagine how it'll taste.

448
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:46,445
-Good.
-In the meantime…

449
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,716
-It looks like squid.
-It does.

450
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,518
Is it done yet?

451
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:55,354
-Let me see if it's safe.
-Safe?

452
00:20:58,891 --> 00:20:59,792
Is it good?

453
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:03,295
-I'm not telling you.
-Don't be silly. I'll taste it myself.

454
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,602
-The soybean powder.
-Yes.

455
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:14,039
I can't imagine what it tastes like
to eat grilled pork rinds

456
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,574
-with soybean powder.
-Right.

457
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,314
Aha.

458
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,785
This is a drinking snack.

459
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:27,419
-Isn't it?
-Yes.

460
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,622
-Does it go well with alcohol?
-Yes, it does.

461
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,390
This is not for rice.

462
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,959
The more you chew, the tastier it gets.

463
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,995
And as you chew it, you drink soju.

464
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:38,364
This is very unique
even as a drinking snack.

465
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:41,967
At the yakitori place,

466
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:45,471
-you licked the sake there, didn't you?
-I did.

467
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:46,605
This is kind of similar.

468
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:51,443
-Soju acts like a palate cleanser.
-I see.

469
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:57,917
Ah.

470
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:04,890
Ah.

471
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:10,563
Do you want some?

472
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:13,866
That's enough.

473
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:21,207
Wow. It's refreshing.

474
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,387
-These two go well together.
-I know.

475
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:38,657
-Korean food tends to be strong in flavor.
-Right.

476
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:41,126
So you alternate between
cleansing your palate and eating.

477
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,996
If soju had a bold flavor,

478
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:45,331
-it wouldn't pair well.
-I agree.

479
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:48,500
-It's not overpowering.
-It doesn't clash with the food.

480
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:52,438
-This pork stays delicious throughout.
-It does.

481
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:53,873
What are you doing?

482
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,178
-Are you reheating it?
-Yes.

483
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,380
I'm going to make a dessert.

484
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:02,948
-A dessert?
-A dessert.

485
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:05,117
Korean style, K-dessert.

486
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:06,252
-One rice, please.
-Sure.

487
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,653
FIRST INGREDIENT: RICE

488
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,355
SECOND INGREDIENT: A CLEAN SPOON

489
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:13,192
The ultimate, unbeatable K-dessert.

490
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:14,693
-I'll make it for you.
-All right.

491
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,629
FOR MATJJIGAE, A DESSERT LOVER

492
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:20,733
K-DESSERT, DIY SOYBEAN PASTE STEW AND RICE

493
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:26,038
That looks good.

494
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,810
It already contains meat,

495
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:33,712
but if you have any leftovers,

496
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,548
-you can cut them up and add them in.
-I see.

497
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:38,284
-Adjust it to your liking.
-Cut it finely.

498
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,819
-You can add garlic…
-Okay.

499
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,922
…or chili peppers to adjust the flavor.

500
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:51,764
Mmm.

501
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,467
Koreans often finish their meal like this.

502
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:59,505
It's in an earthenware pot,
so it stays warm for a long time.

503
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,211
Wow!

504
00:24:06,345 --> 00:24:09,381
This rounds off our meal nicely.

505
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,217
Wow!

506
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:15,621
-Delicious.
-It's warming me up.

507
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:19,491
I had rice with meat, and now
I'm finishing with this porridge.

508
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,033
-Wow.
-You end up eating quite a lot of rice.

509
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,603
It'd be nice to have a place in Japan

510
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:34,673
where you could eat dwaeji-kalbi like this

511
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,409
without spending too much money

512
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,279
-and as often as you want.
-Right…

513
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:41,547
-True.
-Yeah.

514
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,449
It's only 1,900 yen per person,

515
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:46,852
and they give you all of this!

516
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:50,422
Two portions of dwaeji-kalbi,
one soju, and one beer for 48,000 won,

517
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,523
and two bowls of rice.

518
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,026
TOTAL: 50,000 WON

519
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:55,527
-So 50,000 won in total.
-Right.

520
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,296
-It's about 5,000 yen.
-Seriously?

521
00:24:57,363 --> 00:25:00,299
-For the whole thing.
-It's amazing!

522
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:01,900
-I'm so glad you enjoyed it.
-Yeah.

523
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:05,404
The staff from Japan should try this.

524
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:07,906
-Really?
-It's that good.

525
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:11,510
You'll be shocked.
This was a huge success. The best.

526
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,346
-I'm so glad to hear that.
-Let's end things here.

527
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,414
Great work today!

528
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:16,348
THAT'S A WRAP

529
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:17,416
-Yes.
-Okay.

530
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:18,817
One, two, three.

531
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:21,653
You'll switch into meat mode.

532
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,022
"Switch into meat mode," he said.

533
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:24,957
POST-FILMING STAFF LUNCH

534
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,558
One for here, one for there.

535
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:30,062
Wow, he's still at it!

536
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:32,264
He's holding the bone and everything.

537
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:33,799

538
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,768
