-Hi, it's been a while!
-It's so nice to see you.

20
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,366
Wait, have you gotten a bit bigger?

21
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:09,069
I’m always around this size.

22
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:11,438
Thanks for waiting.

00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:29,323
HE LED THE SOLO DINING TREND IN KOREA

30
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:32,492
I should have come to Japan
to discuss this in person.

31
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:33,560
No, it's fine.

32
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:38,131
THE MOVIE VERSION WAS RELEASED
IN JAPAN, KOREA, TAIWAN, AND SINGAPORE

33
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:40,000
Thank you.

34
00:01:40,095 --> 00:01:43,170
THE PERSON BEHIND THE SOLO DINING TREND

35
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,172
-Long time no see.
-It's been a while.

36
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:48,442
I was a bit nervous.

37
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:49,910
You were?

38
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,547
How have you been?

39
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:57,017
It's been quite some time
since we filmed Solitary Gourmet in Korea.

40
00:01:57,351 --> 00:02:00,487
-It was 2016 or 2017.
-That's a long time ago.

41
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:03,824
Back then, you used to visit us on set,

42
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,026
bringing snacks and everything.

43
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,095
-You came all the way to Jeonju.
-I did.

44
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,464
-It was such a fun time.
-It really was.

45
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,799
SI-KYUNG MADE A SPECIAL APPEARANCE
IN THE KOREA EPISODE

46
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,869
I really loved the series.

47
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,504
-I see.
-I still do.

48
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,406
It was the first TV series
I ever studied with

49
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,776
when I started learning Japanese.

50
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:25,112
I watched almost
all the episodes back then.

51
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,448
In Korea, we use the term sungdeok.

52
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,217
-Sungdeok?
-Sungdeok.

53
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,453
-A super fan who made it.
-I see.

54
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:35,956
It's a shortened term
for a successful otaku, or super fan.

55
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:36,990
-Sungdeok.
-Sungdeok.

56
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,892
Oh…

57
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,127
So you are an otaku.

58
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,262
Not to that extent.

59
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,831
-I am a sungdeok, though.
-Okay.

60
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,633
I'm so happy.

61
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,770
HOW KOREA'S NO.1 BALLAD VOCALIST
BECAME A SUNGDEOK

62
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,638
You know I love Solitary Gourmet.

63
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:53,140
Solitary Gourmet fans know…

64
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,341
In Solitary Gourmet…

65
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:55,308
STEP 1: FAN REVEAL

66
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,310
Mr. Solitary Gourmet would…

67
00:02:57,406 --> 00:02:59,346
STEP 2: OBSESSING OVER HIM

68
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:01,014
Goro in Solitary Gourmet…

69
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,220
I want to take Mr. Solitary Gourmet here.

70
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,523
I’d love to be
the coordinator for the show.

71
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:10,891
I know great restaurants.

72
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:13,860
I would love to meet Yutaka Matsushige

73
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:14,895
from Solitary Gourmet.

74
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,196
STEP 3: MAKING A PUBLIC INVITE

75
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,065
It’d be great to have him on my channel.

76
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,067
We could talk about food and life.

77
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,501
Wouldn't it be fun?

78
00:03:22,681 --> 00:03:25,439
The show is titled

79
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,007
"Insanely Good Spots" in Korea.

80
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:28,308
In Japan…

81
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:30,844
-"Foodie friends from nearby countries."
-Right.

82
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,146
-And you named it.
-Yes, I mean…

83
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:38,318
Although Korea and Japan are
neighboring countries,

84
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,054
we have quite different food cultures.

85
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:43,890
I wanted to learn about the differences.

86
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:44,891
I see.

87
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,928
We both eat mackerel,

88
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:51,765
-but prepare it in different ways.
-Right.

89
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:56,103
And Japanese subuta and Korean tangsuyuk
are similar dishes with different styles.

90
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,106
-I'd love to try both and compare.
-I agree.

91
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,408
TWO FOODIES FROM NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES

92
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,110
-Hello.
-Hi.

93
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,144
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

94
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,080
BOND OVER THEIR LOVE FOR FOOD

95
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:08,882
AND SHARE INSANELY GOOD SPOTS

96
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,617
This is good. This is the best.

97
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:13,453
This chicken skewer is amazing.

98
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,989
-They all look tasty.
-This is amazing.

99
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:17,691
This is so delicious!

100
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,092
KOREA-JAPAN TASTE EXCHANGE PROJECT

101
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:20,360
This place is amazing.

102
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,561
This is insane.

103
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:22,929
BEGINS IN TOKYO, JAPAN

104
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,390
EPISODE 1

105
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,533
MATSUSHIGE'S 13-YEAR-LONG
FAVORITE RESTAURANT

106
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,936
IKEBUKURO

107
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,139
-We're in Ikebukuro, right?
-Yes, we are.

108
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,375
The Tokyo Metropolitan Theatre
is here in Ikebukuro.

109
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,711
There's the Sunshine Theater as well.

110
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,012
So it's known for its theaters.

111
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:43,183
You can see
a lot of people involved in theater.

112
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,018
And for a long time,

113
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:46,286
a lot of Asians,

114
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,688
particularly of Chinese descent,

115
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,924
have lived in Ikebukuro.

116
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,126
So there are many Chinese restaurants.

117
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,594
Chinese?

118
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,096
Where are we going today?

119
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:01,368
This one was featured in the third episode
of Solitary Gourmet Season One.

120
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:04,171
I've been coming here ever since.

121
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,772
How many years ago was season one?

122
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,973
It was 13 years ago.

123
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,875
There's a photo of Mama.

124
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,547
Hello.

125
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:14,915
Come on in.

126
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,250
-I've seen the movie.
-Really?

127
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,586
-I loved it.
-Thank you.

128
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,588
Thanks for lending me this before.

129
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,056
-That was a gift.
-Really?

130
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:26,693
SOLITARY GOURMET SEASON ONE
FILMING LOCATION

131
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,030
AND MATSUSHIGE'S
FAVOURITE SPOT FOR 13 YEARS, YANG

132
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:32,966
-So we're here in Yang.
-Yes, Yang.

133
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,801
This is where

134
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,704
Solitary Gourmet really started.

135
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,105
I’ve been coming here a lot.

136
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,242
We’d rent this place

137
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:43,877
for our post-shoot gatherings.

138
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,212
I see.

139
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:46,613
It's just so delicious.

140
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:51,718
And how well do Koreans handle

141
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,119
spicy food?

142
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,889
We can handle spicy food very well.

143
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:59,059
-Mala is Yang's specialty.
-I like it.

144
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,027
MA: A TONGUE-NUMBING SENSATION

145
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,762
Spiciness from Sichuan peppercorns.

146
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,465
I'm addicted
to the spiciness of this place,

147
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:09,269
-especially the numbing sensation.
-You are?

148
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:11,905
-Can you handle spices?
-I love them.

149
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,307
-Mama.
-I'm coming.

150
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:16,943
I love her.

151
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,779
-I'm Mama Yang. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

152
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:21,681
What should I have today?

153
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:24,017
Order what you like first.

154
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:26,820
-I'll take care of the rest.
-Are you sure?

155
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:29,489
REGULAR NOODLES
FRESH NOODLES

156
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,658
TRADITIONAL SOUPLESS TANTANMEN
FROM CHINA

157
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,593
MIX WELL WITH
THE SPICY SAUCE AT THE BOTTOM

158
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,695
Do they sell soupless tantanmen

159
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,230
in Korea?

160
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:39,933
There are many places
that sell tantanmen,

161
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,003
but the soupless version isn't as common.

162
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:47,007
Then we should definitely try
the soupless tantanmen.

163
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,375
-And…
-Your all-time favorite…

164
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,576
Bansans.

165
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:52,646
BANSANS: A TANGY COLD DISH
MADE WITH TOFU SHEETS

166
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:56,116
I could eat this all day.

167
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:58,418
It's made with thinly sliced tofu.

168
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,053
And dumplings are a must.

169
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,088
Which would be better?

170
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,291
-Well…
-Fried, pan-fried, or boiled?

171
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:09,229
Try boiled and pan-fried dumplings first.

172
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:13,533
I can whip up my ura menu today.

173
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,035
-Ura menu?
-Really?

174
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,970
It's insanely good.

175
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,940
She made it for
the filming team's dinner in winter.

176
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:20,874
Wow.

177
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:24,678
URA MENU: A SECRET DISH SERVED
ONLY TO REGULARS, NOT ON THE MENU

178
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:27,147
-I'll go make them.
-Thank you.

179
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:30,116
Who is that on the poster behind you?

180
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:35,956
This old guy's movie…

181
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,158
has been released in Japan.

182
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,093
The Solitary Gourmet.

183
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,264
It will be released
in Korea on March 19th.

184
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,167
LEAD ACTOR: YUTAKA MATSUSHIGE

185
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,302
SCREENPLAY: YUTAKA MATSUSHIGE

186
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,438
DIRECTOR: YUTAKA MATSUSHIGE

187
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,406
In Korea, directors are blunt

188
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,142
about the minimum audience needed
to avoid a financial loss.

189
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,378
-Do you have a certain number in mind?
-Yes.

190
00:07:58,445 --> 00:07:59,379
We had a target,

191
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,114
and we managed to reach it

192
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:03,116
over the past three days.

193
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,020
So with that,

194
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,623
we've hit our initial goal.

195
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,492
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

196
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:13,827
Does that mean…

197
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:14,961
you're buying today?

198
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,763
-Of course!
-I'm kidding.

199
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,733
Isn't "Matsushige" hard to pronounce?

200
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,002
It seems like it.

201
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,937
-Even Japanese broadcasters…
-Mr. Matsushige.

202
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,472
…stumble when they say my name.

203
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,907
-Mr. Matsushige.
-I can tell when it happens.

204
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:29,542
I see.

205
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,211
You can call me "Matjjigae."

206
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:32,178
No, it's fine.

207
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,413
I like it better.

208
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,748
-It's easier for me too.
-"Matjjigae."

209
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:35,982
Mr. Matjjigae.

210
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,484
-Mr. Matjjigae.
-Mr. Matjjigae.

211
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,418
Isn't that easier?

212
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,820
-I'll call you Matjjigae.
-Please do.

213
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,789
-You can call me…
-Si-kyung chan.

214
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:44,924
Hmm…

215
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:46,893
We can always change that.

216
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:48,695
-Si-kyung chan is fine.
-All right.

217
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,130
Let's move on.

218
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,498
In Korea,

219
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:55,535
people don't normally make dumplings
at home, right?

220
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,670
-Yes, we do.
-You do?

221
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:58,805
On Lunar New Year.

222
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,140
-Really?
-Yes.

223
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,409
And we make dumpling soup

224
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,477
called mandu-guk.

225
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,779
Do you eat the soup too?

226
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,048
-Yes, we do.
-Really?

227
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,250
Soup plays a big part in Korean cuisine.

228
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,252
Gukbap, soup with rice.

229
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,953
Naeng-myun, noodles in cold soup.

230
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:17,924
So Koreans often gain weight
when they first come to Japan.

231
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:20,060
They'd get rich pork-bone ramen

232
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,895
and finish all the broth.

233
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:24,297
-In Japan, that's…
-I know.

234
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,033
We feel guilty.

235
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,401
-Some drink it,
-I see.

236
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:29,669
but those around them

237
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,739
give them cold stares,
thinking "Did they just drink the broth?"

238
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,675
Have you had naeng-myun?

239
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:39,979
Well, speaking frankly,

240
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,916
I've never had naeng-myun
that made me say "Wow."

241
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,584
Please leave it to me.

242
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,353
There's a place
all my Japanese friends loved.

243
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,422
They say
"So this is what real naeng-myun is!"

244
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,925
-Really?
-And that they might get addicted to it.

245
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:55,428
Does that mean it's hard to find
a good naeng-myun place in Japan?

246
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,464
Honestly, yes.

247
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,265
-Is that so?
-Even in Korea.

248
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,267
That's crucial information.

249
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:03,937
-Well, it isn’t easy.
-I see.

250
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,873
They add too much seasoning.
It happens in Korea too, but…

251
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:08,708
It's a little different.

252
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,710
Let's try it together sometime.

253
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,978
I'm sure you'll like it.

254
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,313
Here you go.

255
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,881
-The dishes are here.
-Thank you.

256
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:16,783
-This is bansans.
-Bansans.

257
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,952
BANSANS: COLD TOFU DISH
(800 YEN, AROUND 7,500 WON)

258
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:23,556
SOUPLESS TANTANMEN
(1,000 YEN, AROUND 9,500 WON)

259
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,931
I was the first to serve this.

260
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,834
-In Japan?
-Yes. The soupless version.

261
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:46,479
THE HARMONY OF
MALA SAUCE AND FRESH NOODLES

262
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:48,481
Is this like…

263
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,986
-Thank you. Please, go ahead.
-She dishes out the food for you.

264
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:54,787
Thank you.

265
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,723
Feel free to use this.

266
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,160
-Go ahead. You haven't had it before.
-I'm curious.

267
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,828
Please have the first bite.

268
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,631
I come here all the time.

269
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,399
I want you to start first.

270
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:07,767
But in Korea,

271
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,169
the elder starts…

272
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,937
Really? Got it.

273
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,472
-Enjoy the meal.
-Bon appétit.

274
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,647
-Is it good?
-It's delicious.

275
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,822
Is this the medium spicy level?

276
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,091
-Yes, the average level.
-I thought so.

277
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,662
-The Sichuan peppercorns…
-Yes.

278
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:36,763
My throat is…

279
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,498
THE PEPPERCORNS BURN

280
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:39,899
…on fire.

281
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:43,670
How is it, Si-kyung?

282
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:45,705
I…

283
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,943
I love this kind of flavor.

284
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:52,845
It's delicious.

285
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:53,813
BEST MALA IN A WHILE

286
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:56,549
This soupless tantanmen is amazing.

287
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,651
It's so spicy!

288
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,722
Is it spicier than
typical Japanese mala dishes?

289
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:03,890
It is.

290
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:08,061
-Where in China are you from?
-I'm from Sichuan.

291
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,128
SICHUAN, THE HOMELAND OF SPICE

292
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,063
-Sichuan?
-Yes.

293
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,865
-Sichuan has a lot of spicy dishes, right?
-That's right.

294
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:17,070
There are a lot of mountains in Sichuan,
so work can be tough there.

295
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,605
Usually, roads aren't flat.

296
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:23,142
You need to carry loads
and climb up the mountains.

297
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,511
Tan means to carry.

298
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:27,280
That's why it’s called tantanmen.

299
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,349
-Tan means shouldering?
-That's right.

300
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:31,251
-That's what it meant.
-Yes.

301
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:35,922
TANTANMEN: NOODLES CARRIED ON A POLE

302
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:38,358
Are there Korean dishes
that use Sichuan peppercorns?

303
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,525
It's not as common.

304
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,595
But with the recent trend of mala,

305
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,331
Sichuan peppercorns are also trending.

306
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:46,266
I see.

307
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,669
Ma in mala means a numbing sensation.

308
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:52,338
It's a bit addictive.

309
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:55,308
It feels way too spicy at first,

310
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,977
but you find yourself
craving it again the next day.

311
00:12:58,044 --> 00:12:59,178
I see what you mean.

312
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,780
You get hooked.

313
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:03,549
FROM SOLITARY GOURMET

314
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,485
It's packing a punch!

315
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:08,521
Hasn't she put too many
Sichuan peppercorns in this?

316
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:10,757
But somehow,

317
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,626
I can't put my chopsticks down.

318
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,329
Have the peppercorns made me feel high?

319
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,400
Turns out, I was craving
the spicy Sichuan flavor today!

320
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:23,369
Sichuan was the right choice!

321
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:24,804
It's delicious.

322
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:29,409
-Try the bansans after the tantanmen.
-Right.

323
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,443
It cleanses the palate.

324
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,778
BANSANS: TANGY, COLD TOFU SHEETS

325
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,320
I'm not sure how to describe

326
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,522
the texture of tofu sheets.

327
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:46,492
It's like the Korean jellyfish cold dish.

328
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,762
The tanginess of bansans goes well
with the spiciness of tantanmen.

329
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,898
They make a great pair.

330
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,534
-Do you need something to drink?
-Drinks?

331
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,502
-Draft beer, please.
-Sure.

332
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:59,005
-Same for you?
-I don't drink draft beer.

333
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:01,941
-Non-alcoholic beer for me.
-Okay.

334
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,177
When did you quit drinking?

335
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,079
Six or seven years ago.

336
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:07,914
What made you quit?

337
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,717
I drive myself to set.

338
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:14,554
If I still had alcohol in my system,

339
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,623
-that would be quite risky.
-Right.

340
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:21,427
I was never a heavy drinker,
so I figured I'd be okay.

341
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:22,528
It was easy to quit.

342
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,731
But you drank quite a bit
in Jeonju, right?

343
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,599
-That makgeolli was good.
-Korean rice wine.

344
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,434
Especially the fresh makgeolli.

345
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,770
You can't drink that in Japan.

346
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:34,507
Having the chance to try that was great.

347
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:37,009
Why isn't there fresh makgeolli in Japan?

348
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:39,379
It only really stays fresh
for around 10 days.

349
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:43,383
And if there's a lot of movement
during transport,

350
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,951
-makgeolli may fizz over.
-I see.

351
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:49,322
He has a pretty strict work ethic,

352
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,625
but makgeolli made him
arrive a bit late to set.

353
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,527
-That's right.
-He drank too much.

354
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:55,728
He made me drink it.

355
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,497
No, I didn't.

356
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:01,634
You can lead a horse to water,

357
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,936
but you can't make it drink.

358
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:05,271
HAHA

359
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:06,906
These are a good combo.

360
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:08,608
-Wait.
-Which is which?

361
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,812
-Which is which?
-This is non-alcohol.

362
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,147
Are you sure?

363
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,149
It's so hard to tell apart.

364
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,718
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

365
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,195
I'm drinking it cautiously.

366
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:31,998
-It's here.
-There you go.

367
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,800
-Boiled dumplings.
-Boiled dumplings.

368
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,436
BOILED DUMPLINGS
(800 YEN, AROUND 7,500 WON)

369
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,671
-Let's dig in.
-Bon appétit.

370
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:40,273
Try the whole thing in one bite.

371
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:43,242
That's a bit dangerous. It's too hot.

372
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:44,911
It'll burn my mouth.

373
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,714
He did it.

374
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,091
It's amazing.

375
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,463
-This is good.
-Good?

376
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,765
-It's delicious.
-Thank you.

377
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,668
They're amazing Chinese-style dumplings.

378
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,102
-Mama.
-Yes.

379
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,204
What's inside?

380
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,439
Garlic chives and pork.

381
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:14,807
-Just that?
-That's all?

382
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:15,775
Yes.

383
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:17,577
Just pork and garlic chives?

384
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,111
-That's it.
-Impressive.

385
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:26,152
-They’re definitely handmade.
-You can tell, right?

386
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,788
-What about the wrappers?
-All handmade.

387
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:32,124
Do you use the same wrappers
for pan-fried and boiled dumplings?

388
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,894
Yes, but they taste different
once you pan-fry them.

389
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:40,066
WHITE DUMPLING WRAPPERS
TURNED GOLDEN BROWN

390
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,937
PAN-FRIED DUMPLINGS
(800 YEN, AROUND 7,500 WON)

391
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,141
This is the fun part.

392
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,011
Done.

393
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,314
We use the same fillings,
but they taste different.

394
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,216
-Right.
-The taste of the skin changes.

395
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,054
Did you see that?

396
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:04,123
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

397
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:06,526
-The juice burst across the table.
-Onto him?

398
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,131
It'll be a bit different.

399
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:18,738
This is insane.

400
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:20,740
It's so yummy.

401
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:24,911
How can I describe this…

402
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,579
It smells so flavorful.

403
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,748
Japanese people grew up

404
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:31,784
eating pan-fried dumplings.

405
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:34,520
This smell of the oil

406
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:37,557
mixed with that slightly charred scent,

407
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:40,192
makes you think,
"I just had a pan-fried dumplings."

408
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,595
This part is delicious.

409
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:43,963
The crispy skirt is great.

410
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:48,034
Even the skirt is great.

411
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:55,007
It's like the crispy edge of
a Korean green onion pancake.

412
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:58,711
I was surprised
when I visited Korea recently.

413
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:01,480
-There are places specializing in jeon.
-There are some.

414
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,716
They only serve jeon, Korean pancakes.

415
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,217
They have every type of jeon.

416
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,586
That's amazing.

417
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,154
When it rains, Koreans say,

418
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,089
"I'm in the mood for jeon today."

419
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:15,328
Some say it's because the sound of rain
and pan-frying jeon are similar.

420
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,229
I didn't know that.

421
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,432
-"It's jeon and makgeolli day!"
-That's interesting.

422
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,801
-And there's makgeolli served in a jug.
-Exactly.

423
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,237
This is homemade chili oil.

424
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:29,675
FAMOUS MALA RESTAURANT'S CHILI OIL

425
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,010
I am so happy.

426
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:32,945
All great Chinese restaurants

427
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,848
-serve homemade chili oil.
-I made it myself.

428
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:41,220
-In a couple of days after it's made…
-Just in a few days?

429
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,490
-…it hits the right flavor.
-The taste gets richer.

430
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,527
It's mouthwatering.

431
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:52,198
I could just drizzle it
on plain white rice.

432
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:53,666
-It would taste amazing.
-Right.

433
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,835
You could add it to instant noodles,

434
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,771
-like Shin Ramyun.
-It would be delicious.

435
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,439
-It would be totally different.
-Exactly.

436
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:03,576
You really know what tastes good!
Try adding it to miso ramen.

437
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,478
Should we open a restaurant in Korea?

438
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:09,148
There are already so many great places
to eat in Korea,

439
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:11,651
so that would be quite difficult.

440
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,786
URA MENU: SECRET DISH

441
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:16,088
FERMENTED MALA CABBAGE SOUP
(2,000 YEN, AROUND 18,000 WON)

442
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,959
A PERFECT MATCH OF SICHUAN MALA FLAVOR
AND TANGY, FERMENTED NAPA CABBAGE

443
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,363
It's fermented mala cabbage soup.

444
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,498
It's here!

445
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,967
So this is it.

446
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:29,568
This is one of my favorites.

447
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:33,406
I came to love the dish
after having it here.

448
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,876
-Is it glass noodles?
-Yes, and…

449
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,945
-Cabbage?
-Fermented cabbage.

450
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,515
It looks especially spicy today.

451
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,684
-I'm curious.
-It looks like it'll warm me up.

452
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,464
It warms you up, right?

453
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,835
The tanginess is the key, isn't it?

454
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,041
This is so good.

455
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,179
Koreans would love this.

456
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,481
I think everyone would love it.

457
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,149
It has an elegant, layered taste.

458
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:19,318
It's like a mala pork kimchi stew
with glass noodles.

459
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,020
It’s like a slightly refined

460
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:24,690
kimchi stew with mala chili oil.

461
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,426
This would go great with alcohol.

462
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,261
It's a flavor I've never had before.

463
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:30,199
Let me try some.

464
00:20:30,249 --> 00:20:31,179
NEW FLAVOR EVEN TO THE K-FOODIE

465
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:46,712
This is so good.

466
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:47,947
Amazing.

467
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:49,315
This is…

468
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,717
light yet rich,

469
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:54,253
tangy yet spicy.

470
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,821
How do you say "insane" in Korean?

471
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:57,623
YABAI IS AN EXCLAMATION USED IN JAPANESE

472
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,458
-That would be michyeotda.
-Michyeotda.

473
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:00,793
Michyeotda.

474
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,361
This is michyeotda.

475
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,731
-Michyeotda.
-Michyeotda.

476
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:06,932
Remember it, everyone!

477
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,768
This makes me crave Chinese grain liquor.

478
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:09,869
Do you want some baijiu?

479
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,704
Baijiu can be brutal.

480
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,139
It hits hard.

481
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,607
Look, she has some.

482
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:17,042
Could you pour me a little?

483
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,677
Things are taking a risky turn.

484
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:21,514
Thank you.

485
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:28,154
Then let's just clink glasses.

486
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:30,623
Thank you.

487
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:40,666
-Does it go well with the dish?
-It really does.

488
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,403
There are probiotics in it,
so it's good for you.

489
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,740
It's fermented,
so there are probiotics in it.

490
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,375
You'll be surprised tomorrow.

491
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:50,976
You'll feel better.

492
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,913
I’m from the country of
makgeolli and kimchi.

493
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:56,582
You could use some more probiotics.

494
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,652
-Are you really that low on probiotics?
-Japanese eat fermented soybeans.

495
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:00,920
Right.

496
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,589
Makgeolli contains

497
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,691
far more probiotics than yogurt.

498
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:07,960
So when you drink makgeolli,

499
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:10,930
-you'll feel like a baby the next morning.
-A baby?

500
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,065
Like a baby. I see.

501
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:15,067
Does every restaurant in Japan

502
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,303
have a secret dish?

503
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:20,472
I mean there's a word for it, ura menu.

504
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:24,109
Most of the time, ura menu is a dish

505
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,278
-that the staff eat.
-It's a staff meal.

506
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:29,048
If you ask for the ura menu
at a new place,

507
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,250
-they’ll say they don’t have it.
-It’d seem odd.

508
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,953
You’ll only be able to order it

509
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,722
after visiting a few times.

510
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:37,823
Right?

511
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,225
You need to be a regular.

512
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,560
-If you're not…
-You can't have it.

513
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:44,296
If you really want to have it,

514
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,865
please make a reservation.

515
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,499
A RESERVATION IS A MUST

516
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,134
Please try this.

517
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:53,138
I know this is the secret dish, but…

518
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,573
The chili oil is good.

519
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,308
The boiled dumplings are great.

520
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,477
The soupless tantanmen is amazing.

521
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,045
The tantanmen is michyeotda.

522
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:01,480
It is insane.

523
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:02,648
Crazy good.

524
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:06,685
I want to dip the tantanmen into the soup.

525
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:11,257
ENJOYING THE TANTANMEN WITH
FERMENTED MALA CABBAGE SOUP

526
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:20,299
How is it?

527
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:23,702
