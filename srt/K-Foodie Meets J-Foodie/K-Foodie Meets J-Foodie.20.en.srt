1
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:04,738
K-foodie meets J-foodie.

2
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:06,340
This is insane.

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,180
-We are at the Hangang River.
-Hangang River.

4
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:16,750
It's one of the most popular spots
for Seoul residents to hang out and relax.

5
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:18,785
-So it's like a place to rest.
-Yes.

6
00:00:19,648 --> 00:00:22,322
THERE ARE 11 PARKS BY THE HANGANG RIVER

7
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:23,891
BANPO BRIDGE
BANPO HANGANG PARK

8
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:25,759
LOCATED NEAR BANPO BRIDGE

9
00:00:26,355 --> 00:00:28,929
BANPO HANGANG PARK

10
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,965
A ROMANTIC SPOT WHERE YOU CAN WATCH

11
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,434
THE RAINBOW FOUNTAIN DAILY
FROM APRIL TO OCTOBER

12
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:38,972
People have picnics, ride their bikes,

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,607
or go jogging here.

14
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:43,844
It's well-equipped
with various facilities,

15
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:46,747
so there's no one in Seoul
who hasn't been to the Hangang River.

16
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:47,881
Sounds fun.

17
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:49,970
YAY!

18
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:51,952
He's excited.

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,789
-It seems like everyone's having fun.
-Yes.

20
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:58,992
-Hello. Sung Si-kyung is here.
-Please don't.

21
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,828
He is Sung Si-kyung,
the man with an angelic voice.

22
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,185
SCREAMING

23
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,268
-Hello.
-Hello.

24
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:11,538
Look at those two together. I'm jealous.

25
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:13,407
-I'm here with you…
-We're here together too.

26
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:16,577
-Wow, two grown men!
-It's upsetting.

27
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,545
This is really upsetting.

28
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:20,514
It's embarrassing.

29
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:23,483
-Let's park over there.
-This?

30
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:25,719
You did great.

31
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:28,088
-Thank you.
-We're here.

32
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,557
We're here because

33
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:34,661
this time of year, you’ve got to stop by
a Hangang River convenience store.

34
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:36,063
-A convenience store?
-Yes.

35
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,632
It's actually because
of the instant ramyeon.

36
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,400
-What?
-Instant ramyeon.

37
00:01:42,698 --> 00:01:45,372
A MUST-DO AT THE HANGANG RIVER

38
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,210
Eating ramyeon from the convenience store
is part of the culture here?

39
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,012
Yes. We call it "Hangang River Ramyeon."

40
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,480
Hangang River Ramyeon.

41
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,082
EPISODE 20

42
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,117
GO TO THE HANGANG RIVER,
GET YOUR RAMYEON ON

43
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:59,219
-Shall we go inside?
-Shall we order?

44
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,323
They even sell
little toys like these here?

45
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,726
-You can play catch with this.
-Yes.

46
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:07,728
Mats.

47
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,298
These are mats for picnics.

48
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:13,667
-Like plastic tarps?
-Yes.

49
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:16,970
This is a blanket.

50
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:19,272
-Let's sleep here tonight.
-No, no.

51
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,042
-We'll get bitten by mosquitoes.
-That’s true.

52
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:23,977
He sees everything because he's tall.

53
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,381
What is instant ramyeon, exactly?

54
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:28,615
You’ll see inside.

55
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:31,418
They also have ice creams.

56
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,854
What a neat convenience store.

57
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,723
Korean convenience stores
are generally seen as small.

58
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,225
They vary in size,

59
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,694
but unlike in Japan,
you won’t find any really large ones.

60
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:43,296
Hello.

61
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:47,067
I don't know.

62
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,103
-I can just choose what I want?
-Yes.

63
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,606
You haven't tried this one, right?

64
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:53,840
-I haven't.
-It's good.

65
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,156
-This one's good?
-Yes.

66
00:02:55,206 --> 00:02:56,481
-This one then.
-I recommend this.

67
00:02:56,581 --> 00:02:58,779
HOW TO ENJOY HANGANG RIVER RAMYEON
STEP 1. PICK A RAMYEON

68
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,180
Pick something to drink, too.

69
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,282
-Beer.
-None for me today.

70
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,216
How come?

71
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,652
-You're not feeling well?
-I'm playing tennis afterward.

72
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:07,854
What?

73
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:08,889
Aren't you proud of me?

74
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:11,591
Since someone isn't drinking,

75
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,927
I feel like I should at least get
a non-alcoholic drink.

76
00:03:14,123 --> 00:03:16,596
STEP 2. PICK A DRINK
TO GO WITH THE RAMYEON

77
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,198
This one is good. Stir-fried kimchi.

78
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:19,700
-Stir-fried kimchi.
-It's stir-fried.

79
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,435
-Stir-fried kimchi.
-It's good.

80
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:22,903
Do you want eggs in your ramyeon?

81
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,337
-Let's add one.
-Okay.

82
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,806
-I'd like an egg.
-Okay.

83
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,607
STEP 3. CHOOSE TOPPINGS
(KIMCHI, EGGS, ETC)

84
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:31,478
STEP 4. GET A CONTAINER FOR THE RAMYEON

85
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,747
-Shall we go?
-Let's go.

86
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:35,315
Isn't it interesting?

87
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:39,019
-This is the ramyeon cooker?
-Yes, this is where you cook your ramyeon.

88
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,054
So that's how you make it.

89
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,190
HANGANG RIVER RAMYEON COOKER

90
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,158
COOK YOUR OWN RAMYEON
JUST BY PRESSING A BUTTON

91
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,060
Let's add the noodles.

92
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:50,063
I like to break mine apart like this.

93
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,598
-Really?
-Yes.

94
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,267
-Like this.
-That much?

95
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,702
It should be this small.

96
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:59,473
-Should I add the seasoning too?
-Yes, go ahead.

97
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:06,179
-So this takes four minutes.
-Four minutes.

98
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,482
Press the start button.

99
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,350
-Start.
-Yes.

100
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,962
This is a unique setup.

101
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,165
Add the egg after three minutes.

102
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:27,534
-It was a raw egg?
-Yes.

103
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,603
It was a raw egg.

104
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,938
I think instant cup ramyeon
would also be good.

105
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:35,942
But the noodles taste completely different
from instant cup ramyeon.

106
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,979
Instant cup ramyeon feels
more like a snack.

107
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,415
Boiling it like this

108
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,018
-makes it feel like a proper meal.
-Right.

109
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:47,888
Can I add the egg now?

110
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,923
I think so.

111
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,396
What a unique way to eat it.

112
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,430
Ten seconds!

113
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,567
I have a good feeling about this.

114
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,637
-Three, two, one.
-Done!

115
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,109
-It's done.
-Let's go.

116
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:15,115
It’s perfect for a family getaway.

117
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,553
-They seem happy.
-Yes.

118
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:24,925
I used to come here every day to jog.

119
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,426
Yeouido…

120
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,329
-You see those tall buildings over there?
-Yes.

121
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:30,397
That's Yeouido.

122
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:33,500
Back in the day, all the radio stations
used to be located there.

123
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,335
So I would jog all the way there.

124
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:38,238
-When you were on the radio?
-Yes, when I was a radio DJ.

125
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:39,339
I see.

126
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,041
We're here.

127
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,009
We're here.

128
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:45,779
Gosh.

129
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,982
-Let's eat before it gets mushy.
-Okay.

130
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:51,852
I'm already so excited.

131
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,423
The wind is so refreshing.

132
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:01,127
It's been so long
since I had instant ramyeon.

133
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,463
Let's start eating.

134
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:12,505
It's good.

135
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,114
It's spicier than I thought.

136
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,283
-It's a bit spicy, right?
-Yes.

137
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:29,189
-It's good, right?
-It is.

138
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:33,093
The egg is perfectly cooked.

139
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:37,330
It's good.

140
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:38,698
I'm glad.

141
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,601
-The kimchi is stir-fried.
-Yes.

142
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,937
It looks good.

143
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:57,083
Can we cook ramyeon

144
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,419
at Japanese convenience stores?

145
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:01,288
Do you want to try one?

146
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:03,189
No?

147
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,893
Koreans consider boiled ramyeon

148
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,363
a proper meal.

149
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,467
So you can make them with the machines
at the Hangang River to eat as a meal.

150
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:18,672
Is the cooking fee included in the price?

151
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:19,839
You get the bowl

152
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:23,276
and use the machine
for any type of ramyeon

153
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:26,246
-for 3,000 won.
-It's all included in 3,000 won.

154
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:27,213
VARIES BY LOCATION

155
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,715
-It's cheap.
-Yes.

156
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,319
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

157
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,937
I heard it's not good
to drink all the broth,

158
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,773
but why is unhealthy food
always the tastiest?

159
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,076
Food actually does taste better

160
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,045
when there’s that little thrill of guilt

161
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,917
as you think,
“Would it be okay to eat this?"

162
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:07,887
This kind of food really is addictive.

163
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,335
He's really enjoying it.

164
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:24,738
It's good.

165
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,709
And I made this at home.

166
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,182
How cute!

167
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:38,351
Cute, right?

168
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,023
A cute gimbap made by a grown man.

169
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,391
For a grown man.

170
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:47,560
A gimbap made by a grown man
for a grown man.

171
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,896
This turned into something
the size of a futomaki.

172
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:53,266
What’s that wrapped around the outside?

173
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,236
It’s aged kimchi. Fermented napa cabbage.

AGED KIMCHI GIMBAP, SMILE GIMBAP

178
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,148
I'm going to pack some smile gimbap
and aged kimchi gimbap

179
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,817
for our outing at the Hangang River.

180
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,553
Mix it with the sauce
that comes out of the kimchi.

181
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,555
HE EVEN REVEALED THE RECIPE
ON HIS YOUTUBE CHANNEL

182
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,390
Then you roll it like this.

183
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,528
It's so good.

184
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,030
-Amazing.
-Have some.

185
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:27,734
Oh, I see how you rolled it.
Thank you for the food.

186
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:29,202
-Try it.
-The inside…

187
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,804
-It's tuna mayo.
-Tuna mayo.

188
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,251
Aged kimchi gimbap

189
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,054
made for a grown man by a grown man.

190
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:49,289
It's good.

191
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,390
Really?

192
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,760
It has that deep, fermented flavor.

193
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:55,528
-I can taste it.
-I washed

194
00:09:55,628 --> 00:10:00,166
the aged kimchi
and seasoned it with sesame oil.

195
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:01,188
It's actually good.

196
00:10:01,263 --> 00:10:02,133
-Really?
-Yes.

197
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,375
It's surprisingly good.

198
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,881
But it's a bit annoying
that it looks so cute.

199
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:21,788
Is this what it'd feel like?

200
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,858
If I had a girlfriend

201
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:30,130
and she enjoyed the food I packed for her,
I'd feel so happy.

202
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:33,333
It's really good and I'm so happy.

203
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,667
-Really?
-Yes.

204
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:37,770
-Yes.
-I didn’t think that would be

205
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:38,938
possible for me.

206
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:42,108
Two grown men having fun together? No way.

207
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:45,612
I thought this place was a must.

208
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:49,816
I knew I had to bring you here
at least once.

209
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:53,786
I used to see the Hangang River
while passing by,

210
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:57,423
-but it always looked…
-Yes.

211
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,525
…kind of bleak.

212
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:04,030
I never thought of it
as a relaxing spot like this.

213
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:07,901
This place is truly a relaxing spot
for Seoul citizens,

214
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:11,404
so I hope you can feel
that atmosphere too.

215
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,275
It's a good date spot
and has amazing night views.

216
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,976
Date spot?

217
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:20,346
It gets hot during June and July,

218
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:23,583
so everyone wants to
come hang outside at night.

219
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:26,853
But it's hard for us celebrities

220
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,956
to sit outside in the open.

221
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,225
So we drive here often for a date.

222
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:35,728
We would park here,
put on some music, and just talk.

223
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,200
When you're sitting like this and talking,

224
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,302
saying things like "I love you,"

225
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,205
you tend to turn your body like this

226
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,740
and mess up your posture,

227
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,409
so your spine's twisted to the right.

228
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,011
And the other person
probably ends up like this.

229
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,447
So you can kind of tell.

230
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:57,750
"That person's body seems
twisted to one side these days."

231
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,519
-That’s how you know they're dating?
-Yes.

232
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,688
-It's a date spot.
-And you

233
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,057
hung out here alone?

234
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,191
Or with my manager.

235
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:08,094
With your manager?

236
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:14,601
Just by bringing things like these,

237
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,402
this place could become
a pizza restaurant

238
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:17,870
or a sushi restaurant.

239
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,906
You can have any food you want delivered.

240
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,509
You can get bingsu delivered too.

241
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,744
That's one of your favorites.

242
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:27,847
-They deliver bingsu all the way here?
-Yes.

243
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,750
-There’s a designated spot for it.
-So you have to go get it.

244
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,153
-Sulbing.
-Yes.

245
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,656
-Yes.
-I haven’t had it yet this time.

246
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:38,925
THEY'RE NOT A SPONSOR
HE JUST LOVES SULBING

247
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:39,859
Would you like some?

248
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,327
-Shall we have Sulbing?
-Yes.

249
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,897
-They deliver it?
-Yes.

250
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,902
Since you can't read Korean…

251
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,572
There's one with rice cakes, bean powder,

252
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,307
and condensed milk.

253
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,977
-Apple mango cheese…
-No, it's not that.

254
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:00,079
-Zanmang Loopy…
-No, not that.

255
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,048
Oh, it must be injeolmi Sulbing.

256
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,752
The one with rice cakes,
bean powder, and condensed milk.

257
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,222
-That one.
-Okay.

258
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,024
-Yes.
-Okay. What toppings do you want?

259
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,792
Double the condensed milk.

260
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:13,860
Double?

261
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,362
Should we also order coffee?

262
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:18,364
-Coffee. Okay.
-Coffee.

263
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:20,967
It's like I'm ordering for my girlfriend.

264
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,403
It's like I'm ordering for my girlfriend.

265
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,306
-I'll go with decaf.
-You sure you're okay with that?

266
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,708
-Decaf. Hot.
-Decaf.

267
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:29,876
Decaf, hot?

268
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,110
Okay.

269
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,048
Wow, it really feels like I went on a date

270
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,749
for the first time in a while.

271
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,651
It really feels like

272
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:42,088
I went on a date
for the first time in a while.

273
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,456
You and me? On a date?

274
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:47,493
I wondered, "Why do I feel so excited?"

275
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,628
but when I turned…

276
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:51,931
-A grown man…
-And I do like you,

277
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:55,134
-but instead of a cute girl…
-An old man.

278
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,170
…you were sitting there, smiling.

279
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,271
Old man.

280
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,773
An old man waiting for patbingsu.

281
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:06,179
It feels like he's my actual girlfriend.
I want to take photos of him.

282
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,616
What is it?

283
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,586
Hold on. Just stay right there.

284
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:15,355
Should I go buy that blanket

285
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:16,923
from before?

286
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,524
Oh, Chicken Pop!

287
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:19,492
Chicken Pop!

288
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,862
That was the loudest he's spoken.
"Chicken Pop!"

289
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,932
-Chicken Pop.
-You're so into it.

290
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:35,375
-I'm happy.
-We're on a date.

291
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,313
Love is in the air.

292
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,392
Is it good?

293
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,695
It's the most delicious snack in Korea.

294
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:58,664
-It's that good?
-Yes.

295
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,300
King of the snacks.

296
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,272
It's good.

297
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:11,110
-You didn't know?
-I keep reaching for more.

298
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:15,782
It's like how you can't
stop eating instant ramyeon.

299
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:19,385
Chicken Pop is just as addictive.

300
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,120
Is it also trending in Japan?

301
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,055
They don't sell it in Japan.

302
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:26,426
So I tried to buy it in bulk
to promote it widely in Japan,

303
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:29,061
but they don’t sell it that way.

304
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,299
Have this while you wait
for the bingsu.

305
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:40,706
Look at the vibe.

306
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,210
The sunset is beautiful.

307
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:49,482
There's no specific time limit for
entering the Hangang River parks, right?

308
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:50,883
-Right.
-It's open 24/7?

309
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:55,054
It's not really a business.
It's more like a space for the people.

310
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:58,291
-You could come here at night…
-Yes.

311
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,960
…let out a big scream

312
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:03,496
to shake off the day’s frustrations,
have a bowl of ramyeon…

313
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:05,131
-Yes.
-…and just let it all go.

314
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:06,599
There's also soju.

315
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,868
So how come you didn't drink today?

316
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:11,571
-I wanted to show you.
-Show me what?

317
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,340
That I don't always drink.

318
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:15,942
I wanted to play tennis at night.

319
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,345
I even have blisters.

320
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:23,082
You do.

321
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,351
-Tennis.
-Yes, I love playing tennis.

322
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:27,587
Did you play since you were young?

323
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:31,224
-It's been over ten years now.
-It's not as long as I thought.

324
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,092
I love sports.

325
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,094
I've boxed for a while as well.

326
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:38,664
I ran a lot and I loved to hike.

327
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,366
You're active.

328
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,134
Because if I don't work out,

329
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,136
my lifestyle

330
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:47,073
tends to get a bit unhealthy.

331
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,307
I also like to drink, so…

332
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,142
But no matter how hard I try,

333
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,345
your body’s probably
in better shape than mine.

334
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:54,580
You think so?

335
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:56,716
I ate instant ramyeon,

336
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,451
Chicken Pop,

337
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,520
and I'm going to eat bingsu.

338
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,655
But you're having a great time.

339
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:05,324
It's here.

340
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,030
It's finally here.

341
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,100
So they deliver it like this.

342
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,569
I ordered extra condensed milk.

343
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,172
Extra condensed milk.

344
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,778
INJEOLMI BINGSU
9,500 WON, 950 YEN

345
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,682
Look at how happy he is.

346
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,319
It's here.
I'm going to pour the condensed milk.

347
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,093
-Nice.
-Here you go.

348
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,228
Wasn't there one more?

349
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:44,330
-Should I pour this too?
-Yes.

350
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,634
DOUBLE CONDENSED MILK

351
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,310
Perfect.

352
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,613
You're the best
at pouring condensed milk in Korea.

353
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,720
Gosh, the look on his face is so…

354
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,755
It's been a while since I had Sulbing.

355
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:17,363
Delicious.

356
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:20,399
Sometimes he's like my son.

357
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:23,803
It’d be nice to have a grandpa
who doesn't feel that much older than me.

358
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:27,173
A grandpa who has a sweet tooth
and is fun to chat with.

359
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:29,875
Please check it later,
when this episode airs.

360
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,978
-Check what later?
-What I said just now.

361
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:55,301
He hasn't looked at me once
since this came.

362
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,372
You haven't looked at me once
since the bingsu came.

363
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,374
-I have to focus.
-That is true.

364
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,510
He's really enjoying it.

365
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:16,922
It's sweet.

366
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,160
Grandpa, you added
too much condensed milk.

367
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:22,662
I added too much.

368
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,098
Is there milk in this?

369
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,434
-It's frozen milk.
-Frozen milk?

370
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,602
That's the base.

371
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,705
This is really good.

372
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:34,573
You don't eat this often?

373
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,975
No.

374
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:39,745
I never thought I’d be introduced to
injeolmi patbingsu by a Japanese person.

375
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:42,114
-What was this again?
-Bean powder.

376
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,717
-Japan has bean powder too, right?
-Yes.

377
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:47,987
But sprinkling bean powder
over ice isn’t something

378
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:49,455
Japanese people usually think of.

379
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,323
Koreans love bean powder.

380
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:56,729
It's amazing we live in a time where
you can eat ramyeon by the river

381
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,832
and then have bingsu right after.

382
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:01,767
-Right.
-Amazing times.

383
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:04,670
-It was unthinkable back then.
-Unthinkable.

384
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,808
This is a nice change of pace.

385
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:11,610
Relaxing without drinking.

386
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,547
People who drink often

387
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:17,049
normally eat salty food first…

388
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:18,317
-Yes.
-…and then drink soju.

389
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:20,219
For us,

390
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:22,121
we eat something cold

391
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:23,622
and sweet

392
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,558
then drink hot coffee

393
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,662
and be like,
"How warm. I feel refreshed."

394
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:34,066
That’s the best kind of positive cycle.

395
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,502
It's nice.

396
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,838
I could fall in love while eating this.

397
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,474
Sugary stuff like this

398
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,343
just makes you feel good.

399
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:50,316
Then shout your decision
about marriage out loud

400
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:53,452
here at the Hangang River.

401
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,055
There's no way I can do
something like that.

402
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:57,857
I’m starting to feel more and more open.

403
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,126
It makes me want to say things
I shouldn’t.

404
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,393
-That's it.
-Yes.

405
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,030
No matter how great a place is,
you can't get this kind of vibe

406
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,032
-when you're surrounded by buildings.
-Yes.

407
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,002
Might as well lay it all out here.

408
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,241
I almost said it.

409
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:16,675
NEXT INSANELY GOOD SPOT

410
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,011
Sweetie, this place is so nice.

411
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,317
It's nice.

412
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,653
Come on. This is just wrong.

413
00:21:29,117 --> 00:21:31,290
THE MOST EXPENSIVE MONT BLANC IN KYOTO

414
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,038
