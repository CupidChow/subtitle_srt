00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:05,972
This is insane.

JANGDAN SOYBEANS GROW IN WELL-DRAINED SOIL

00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:25,258

is inside the Civilian Control Zone.

15
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,954
Yes.

16
00:00:55,021 --> 00:01:01,461
Jangdan Soybean Village is
only about 10 km from North Korea.

17
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:02,996
10 km isn't far.

18
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,466
It's about an hour on foot
and under 10 minutes by car.

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,369
You need proper ID,

20
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,871
then you can enter after verification.

1.5 KM AHEAD: CIVILIAN CONTROL ZONE
UNAUTHORIZED VEHICLES TURN BACK

33
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:55,849
-People do live in the village, right?
-Not many, but yes.

34
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:58,351
I looked into it.

35
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:03,156
Villagers received
military training until the '70s

36
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,290
to prepare for emergencies.

37
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:05,959
-Villagers did?
-Yes.

38
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:09,128
They say it was for emergencies.

39
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:12,165
That's how it used to be, I hear.

40
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:18,805
But I've actually been there
a few times for shoots.

41
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:21,441
It's really clean.

42
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:24,777
The water and air are so fresh.

43
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:26,613
Because for tofu, water is key.

44
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:29,215
-It sure is for tofu.
-Beans, water, salt.

45
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:32,118
So I'm excited to see how good it tastes.

46
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:42,695
Is this a checkpoint?

47
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,164
Yes.

48
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,035

00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,140
We're in Paju.

ARRIVED AT CHECKPOINT

55
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:06,953
For years--

56
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,188
-Please open the window.
-Okay.

57
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:09,289
Hello.

58
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,459
-Thanks for cooperating. Two people?
-Yes.

59
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,529
The Japanese guest's name, please?

60
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:22,001
It's Matsushige. Matsushige.

61
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,406
-Please open the rear window.
-Yes.

62
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,815
-Do I leave my passport here?
-Yes.

63
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,619
They're pretty strict.

64
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,120
As they should be.

65
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:42,255
Then this is…

66
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,157
This isn't a place

67
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:49,662
you just drop by for a bite.
It's not an easy stop.

68
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,630
No.

69
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,765
Still,

70
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:55,902
it feels like entering
a place we've never known.

71
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,036
Of course.

72
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,438
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

73
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,140
-Permit?
-Yes.

74
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,811
Keep up the good work.

75
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,280
They're saluting.

76
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,983
Serious security.

77
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:11,851
We're going in.

78
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,688

CIVILIAN CONTROL ZONE
DOES NOT EVEN SHOW ON THE MAP

81
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:25,064
This place feels like a massive film set.

82
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:26,699
For real.

83
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,667
Look.

84
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,138
It really feels like
Joint Security Area or Shiri.

85
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,206
Yes, Shiri.

86
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,141
It feels like we're in that world.

87
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:42,348
Are those mountains
over there in North Korea?

88
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:43,716
Could be.

89
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,286
Maybe.

90
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,056
I've actually been to North Korea.

91
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,258
-What for?
-A concert.

92
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,226
Not a solo concert.

93
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,628
Maybe radio? Or was it TV?

94
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,430
It was scary.

95
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:58,965
-Scary?
-It was.

96
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,566
-That's scary.
-It is.

97
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,569
But we don't go that deep in.

98
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:06,439
The spot is nearby.

99
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,276
Tong-ilchon Soybean Village, Mame-mura.

100
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,712
Even the decor is soldiers.

TONG-ILCHON JANGDAN SOYBEAN VILLAGE

102
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:19,619

103
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:23,056
BY 40 DISPLACED FAMILIES
AND 40 VETERAN FAMILIES

104
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,261
Here we are. Jangdan Soybean Village.

105
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,429
Amazing.

106
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,699
-We crossed a heavily guarded bridge.
-We did.

107
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,934
Look over there. That's a jangdokdae.

108
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:40,239
Inside are gochujang,
doenjang, and ganjang.

109
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:41,441
All of these?

110
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,408
Yes.

111
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,611
They keep adding jang over time,

112
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,947
so these aren't
just one or two years old.

113
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:56,789
VARIOUS JANG-BASED CONDIMENTS

114
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,462
Shall we open one?

115
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,364
FILMING THE JANGDOKDAE WAS PRE-APPROVED

116
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,932
It's fermenting.

117
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,767
Amazing. The aroma's coming up.

118
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,636
-Looks like doenjang.
-Doenjang, for sure.

119
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,939
-Can you see it?
-Yes, looks like nukamiso.

120
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,244
What do you call miso?
What kind of jang is that?

121
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:21,347
-Doenjang.
-Right. Doenjang jjigae! Doenjang jjigae.

122
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,850
-Shoyu is ganjang.
-Ganjang.

123
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:24,851
Doenjang. Ganjang.

124
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,053
-Gochujang is just gochujang.
-Gochujang.

125
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,287
Shall we go in?

126
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:29,255
Let's go in.

127
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,323
Hello.

128
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,891
-Hello.
-Hello.

129
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,693
-Good afternoon.
-Excuse us.

130
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,027
Mr. Matsushige?

131
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,329
-Yes.
-Nice to meet you.

132
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,831
-She says she's happy to meet you.
-Hello, thank you.

133
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,066
Our daughter is a huge fan.

134
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,901
-Her daughter likes you a lot.
-Thank you.

135
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,871
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Please come in.

136
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:45,972
She's inviting us in.

137
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,007
Excuse us.

We're at Jangdan Soybean Village today.

143
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:21,974
Let's enjoy dishes
made with the local jangdan soybeans.

144
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,143
Dishes made with soybeans?

145
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,344
Tofu.

146
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:26,746
-Tofu dishes.
-Tofu, yes.

147
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,449
-Japan has many kinds of tofu.
-Many.

148
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:33,786
Korea also has regular tofu,
yeondubu, sundubu, and cheonggukjang.

149
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,088
-It varies by how it's made.
-I see.

150
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:39,926
They also pan-fry tofu here.

151
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,895
-In perilla oil, like a steak.
-Like a steak?

152
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,465
They also have soup dishes too.

153
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,467
You can try a range of dishes.

154
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:49,602
They have photos.

155
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,238
-This is the set meal.
-Set meal.

156
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,241
-Even tofu dishes are in the set?
-They're all included.

157
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,676
This is tofu jijim.

158
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,345
Tofu kimchi.

159
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:02,548
"Son" means handmade.
Handmade tofu kimchi.

160
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:05,151
As I mentioned,
bossam is boiled pork with kimchi.

161
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,619
Koreans wrap and eat it.

162
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:07,820
-We eat it as ssam.
-Indeed.

163
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,121
-This is jeongol.
-Jeongol.

164
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:10,556
This is jeyuk-bokkeum.

165
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,059
Korea's version of ginger pork.

166
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:15,895
Shall we order the set?

167
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,464
Ma'am, what comes with the set?

168
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:21,234
It comes with sundubu,
doenjang stew, and cheonggukjang stew.

169
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,502
Three ttukbaegi stews.

170
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:23,503
Cheonggukjang?

171
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:25,271
-Yes.
-A natto-style stew?

172
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,572
Yes, they have that.

173
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,941
With the set,
we recommend perilla oil tofu jijim.

174
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,310
It's great alongside the set.

175
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,880
ORDER
2 SET MEALS + PERILLA OIL TOFU JIJIM

176
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,815
PERILLA OIL TOFU JIJIM? LOVE IT!

00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:39,452
They also have dongdongju,
makgeolli, soju, beer, and soft drinks.

178
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,087
You have to drive today.

179
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,122
I'm not driving.

180
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,324
-Is someone else driving us back?
-Yes.

181
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:46,726
-You can drink then.
-Just one glass.

182
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:47,693
Sure.

183
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,897
ORDER: JANGDAN SOYBEAN SET,

184
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:53,366
PERILLA OIL TOFU JIJIM, MAKGEOLLI

185
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,468
Nice weather today.

186
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,636
It's perfect.

187
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:01,274
We managed to get outside Seoul.

188
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,310
Weather can totally change your mood.

189
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,046
Right. It's a really good season now.

190
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,814
-Korean autumn.
-Autumn.

191
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,416
It's getting shorter, though.

192
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,055
-Hello.
-Hello.

193
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,924
This is kimchi jeon.

194
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,825
-It's jangtteok.
-Jangtteok?

195
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:23,963
Jangtteok is a jeon made with gochujang.

196
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,031
So it's jeon.

197
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:29,335
Mixing jang into the batter isn't typical.

198
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,636
It's a unique dish.

199
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,572
What's this?

200
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:33,773
Thinned radish seedlings.

201
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,508
-So radish greens?
-Right.

202
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,842
This is from the radish…

203
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,544
It's the leaves.

204
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,314
-Is this pumpkin?
-Pumpkin with pulchi.

205
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,116
Pulchi is juvenile cutlassfish.

206
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:45,217
Oh, it's fish.

207
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:46,819
When cutlassfish are at their smallest.

208
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,154
PULCHI (JUVENILE CUTLASSFISH)

209
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,658
RADISH MUCHIM, PUMPKIN PULCHI BOKKEUM,
FISH CAKE BOKKEUM, KKAKDUGI

210
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,060
CABBAGE KIMCHI
BEAN SPROUT MUCHIM

211
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,261
YANGNYEOM GANJANG

212
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,296
JANGTTEOK

213
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,799
What's this one? This?

214
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,734
These are beans. It's kongjang.

215
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,470
Kongjang used to be a staple side dish.

216
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,607
-You know…
-In Japan, there's moromi.

217
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:11,978
It's neither miso nor soy sauce,

218
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:15,081
but a bean mash
just before it becomes soy sauce.

219
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:17,750
Just before?

220
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,752
I thought it looked close to moromi.

221
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:21,520
MOROMI

222
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:26,592
FERMENTED MASH OF SOYBEANS, BARLEY, RICE
USED AS A BASE FOR SOY SAUCE, MISO, MIRIM

223
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,027
Please, try it.

224
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,030
-Thank you for the food.
-Please enjoy.

225
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:40,072
-It's similar to moromi.
-Similar?

226
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,142
It's slightly fermented.

227
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,979
Japanese people often put it on cucumber.

228
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:49,315
-Yes! I know.
-Moromi cucumber.

229
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,684
-It's a bit softer.

230
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:57,423
Kimchi from near North Korea.

231
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:04,430
Delicious.

232
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:06,799
How's the jangtteok?

233
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,205
It's great, as expected.

234
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,549
-It's good.
-Delicious.

235
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,820
Do you shake this?

236
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,155
You do.

237
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,256
Like this?

238
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,092
Shake it with confidence like a bartender.

239
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:35,761
That's good.

240
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,734
That's right.

241
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,070
Don't shake carbonated water.

242
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,037
No.

243
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,240
Thank you.

244
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,746
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

245
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:02,822
I haven't eaten anything today.

246
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:03,889
Really?

247
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:04,957
I'm hungry.

248
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:08,794
When I'm hungry,

249
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:12,131
I usually crave animal protein.

250
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,666
True. It's here!

251
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,301
But this one's plant protein.

252
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,875
JANGDAN SOYBEANS
FIRST DISH

253
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:27,413
PERILLA OIL TOFU JIJIM
1,500 YEN / 15,000 WON

254
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,482
This is perilla oil tofu jijim.

255
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,884
It's made with perilla grown here.
Oil pressed in-house.

256
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:32,952
It must be delicious.

257
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,023
The perilla oil is from here.

258
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:42,394
They press perilla grown on-site.

259
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,063
-Try it.
-Perilla oil.

260
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,132
We call it deulgireum.

261
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,669
I'll go for the seasoned side.

262
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:57,710
Is it simply tofu
pan-fried in perilla oil?

263
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,677
Yes, that's right.

264
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:04,784
Tasty.

265
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:12,258
Delicious.

266
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:14,126
So good.

267
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,964
Dip it in that ganjang sauce.

268
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,618
It's like a tender steak.

269
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:45,191
The perilla oil is soaked in. Great aroma.

270
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,092
The umami of the oil really bursts.

271
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:55,835
Delicious.

272
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:05,945
Do most Korean homes keep perilla oil?

273
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,280
Sesame oil is the main one. Chamgireum.

274
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,515
I see.

275
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,984
Some people favor perilla oil.

276
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,987
-I see.
-You use them differently.

277
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:18,557
They say perilla oil is healthier.

278
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,726
The aroma's richer too.

279
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,329
-At this hour…
-Excuse me.

280
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:24,730
What's this?

281
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,600
-Sundubu.
-Sundubu.

282
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,602
"Sun" means mild. Sundubu.

283
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,136
Doenjang.

284
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,204
Doenjang jjigae.

285
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,741
Cheonggukjang.

286
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:39,044
JANGDAN SOYBEANS
SECOND DISH

287
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:43,215
JANGDAN-SOYBEAN SET (FOR 2)
2,600 YEN / 26,000 WON

288
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:47,820
Is this the sundubu jjigae
that the Japanese know?

289
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,521
-It's the base.
-I see, the base.

290
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:54,126
Make this red and spicy,
and you get sundubu jjigae.

291
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,395
This isn't sundubu jjigae.
It's just sundubu.

292
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:57,329
Sundubu.

293
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,867
First, try the sundubu as is.

294
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:03,836
Thanks.

295
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,473
Then add the ganjang sauce.

296
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:15,714
Delicious.

297
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:29,962
Sundubu is delicious.

298
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,304
You can smell the soybeans.

299
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,007
-It's the "sun" in sundubu, right?
-Yes.

300
00:15:58,657 --> 00:15:59,658
It's like milk.

301
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:01,493
Nutty.

302
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,162
It's bound to be good for you.

303
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:04,663
Excellent.

304
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,474
What was this again?

305
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,576
Doenjang jjigae.

306
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:19,278
So it isn't cheonggukjang.

307
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,246
I'll do the gimi.

308
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,950
Gimi is checking for poison
before the king eats.

309
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:29,254
Gimi. A royal taste test.

310
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,595
How is it? Good?

311
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,430
-Spicy, spicy.
-Spicy?

312
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,265
It's a pleasant heat.

313
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,901
It doesn't look spicy though.

314
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:50,576
Delicious.

315
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,215
Pretty spicy.

316
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,451
This doenjang jjigae
might be spicy for Japanese.

317
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:06,525
Cheongyang chilies
from the country are really spicy.

318
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:07,659
-Spicy?
-Yes, spicy.

319
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,261
Spicy even for you, Si-kyung?

320
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,629
Yes, it is spicy.

321
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:12,965
I'll do the gimi for the cheonggukjang.

322
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:27,913
Delicious.

323
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,915
This cheonggukjang jjigae is great.

324
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:31,617
It's Korean natto.

325
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,459
-This cheonggukjang jjigae is great.
-Right?

326
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,594
Cheonggukjang jjigae is delicious.

327
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,534
The taste is deep.

328
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,472
Cheonggukjang jjigae is the best.

329
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:30,943
For a Japanese, cheonggukjang jjigae
is an unfamiliar taste.

330
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,479
It's new and delicious.

331
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:47,326
Each dish uses the same tofu,

332
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:48,694
the same jangdan soybeans,

333
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,230
yet the flavors cover a wide range.

334
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,899
Same ingredients--

335
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,534
Yet you don't get tired of them.

336
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:56,668
Exactly.

337
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,871
Jangdan soybeans are like a blank canvas.

338
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:02,207
They transform
depending on how you cook them.

339
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:06,778
Even for people from Seoul,
the food tastes different

340
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,747
when they come
all the way out to the CCZ, right?

341
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,748
It does.

342
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,584
What's different? The jang?

343
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,052
It has a homemade feel.

344
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:17,055
It's rich. It's good.

345
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,424
Still…

346
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,928
I haven't eaten since last night,

347
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,197
so I'm craving some meat.

348
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,901
Sorry. What should we do?

349
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,471
It's okay, it's okay.

350
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:33,605
Should we order jeyuk?

351
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,842
It's fine, we've got dinner later.

352
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:40,712
Tofu is healthy.

353
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,781
Still not quite hitting the spot, is it?

354
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,318
Do you have any pork already boiled?

355
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,986
-We have bossam.
-You do? Already boiled?

356
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:48,887
Of course.

357
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,723
We'll pay. Could we get just the meat?

358
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,661
We have a meat-only add-on.
We'll prepare that for you.

359
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,663
Perfect. I should've ordered sooner.

360
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:01,099
This place would've been nice
even at 10 a.m. in the morning.

361
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,068
Yes. For breakfast.

362
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,204
It feels like a breakfast meal.

363
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,807
-Grilled mackerel would make it breakfast.
-It feels like a breakfast set.

364
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:09,875
Here it is.

365
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,544
Excuse me.

366
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,113
The pork is here!

367
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:20,185
Since you said you wanted animal protein.

368
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:23,589
-Pork's here.
-You were mumbling it, remember?

369
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:26,592
There's a bossam meat add-on, apparently.

370
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:27,626
So there is.

371
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,597
You ordered just the meat.

372
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:35,167
A meat-only add-on usually
comes with just meat and sauce.

373
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,735
-Usually?
-Right.

374
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:40,372
But since you're special guests,
this is on the house.

375
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,608
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

2,000 YEN / 20,000 WON

378
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:53,785
This is it.

379
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,156
Now that I see it, I want some.

380
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:11,470
Si-kyung's choice.

381
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:12,738
-Si-kyung's choice.
-Si-kyung's choice.

382
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:19,578
Is this aged kimchi?

383
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:20,746
Stir-fried kimchi.

384
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:22,814
Oh, stir-fried kimchi.

385
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:36,361
Mr. Matjjigae is in a better mood
now that the bossam's out.

386
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:40,032
Earlier, no matter how much you ate,

387
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,501
you still looked low on energy.

388
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:45,771
You know, pork in Korea is really good.

389
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:47,773
-Totally.
-I feel it deep in my bones.

390
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,008
I was thinking,
"There must be pork somewhere."

391
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,977
Going "Pig-chan, Pig-chan,"

392
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,478
I'm always calling for it.

393
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:56,682
Bossam goes well with anything.

394
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:59,151
It even goes well
with doenjang and cheonggukjang.

395
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:02,321
Bossam works with all the jang sauces

396
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:04,222
and makes the other dishes shine.

397
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,224
Yes, it's delicious.

398
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:54,206
-Cheonggukjang jjigae is the best.
-Please, help yourself.

399
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:00,679
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

400
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,347
Another cheonggukjang, please.

401
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,716
He liked it so much, he took mine.

402
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,052
Sure. Please wait a moment.

403
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,720
Another order of cheonggukjang!

404
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:10,689
