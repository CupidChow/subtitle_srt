00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,143
This is insane.

00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,649
TODAY'S FOODIE DESTINATION
BUSAN

7
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:57,457
Mr. Matjjigae, are you a morning person?

8
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,359
-Yes, I am.
-I knew it.

9
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:03,530
I usually get up around 5:00 a.m.

10
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:06,099
-I see. And you go for a walk?
-Right.

11
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,068
-And make breakfast.
-Yes.

12
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:10,103
-He's a decent human being.
-A decent human being.

13
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,572
I don't know about that.

14
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:12,873
It's pretty early for me.

15
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,041
CURRENT TIME: 8 A.M.

16
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,676
Is 8:00 a.m. still part of last night?

17
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,411
I've stayed out drinking until this hour

18
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:19,246
-more times than I can count.
-Okay.

19
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:21,448
I think it's been like 30 years

20
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:25,385
since I actually got up and got ready
to have breakfast this early.

21
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:26,553
Are we having breakfast?

22
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,422
-Yes, it's breakfast time.
-I see.

23
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,824
This area is called Donggwang-dong.

24
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:33,293
I'm no expert on Busan either,

25
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,630
-but there's Busan Port.
-Right, the port.

26
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:40,467
So there used to be
a lot of Japanese visitors.

27
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:42,669
There's a hotel called "Busan Hotel" here,

28
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:47,007
and apparently, lots of Japanese people
used to stay at that hotel.

29
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:51,144
So you'll see Japanese signs
in the neighborhood,

30
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:56,583
and there are quite a few spots
that are popular with Japanese visitors.

31
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,787
One of them is a freshwater marsh clam,
jaecheop, specialty place.

32
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:03,290
A freshwater marsh clam specialty place?

33
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:06,793
What's the general image
of the freshwater marsh clam in Japan?

34
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,032
Mainly, it's something people have
in soups for breakfast.

35
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,935
In clear soups or miso soup.

36
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,971
That's basically
the only way they're eaten.

37
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:21,875
Anyway, lots of dads who drink

38
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:24,578
have freshwater marsh clam soup

39
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:30,017
because they figure, "If I don't eat this,
my liver's going to get worse."

40
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,618
A life-giving broth.

41
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,120
Exactly.

42
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,455
-Is this it?
-This is it.

43
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,823
-"Jaecheop-guk restaurant."
-Yes.

44
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:37,891
SEOMJINGANG JAECHEOP-GUK

45
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,326
They have Japanese on the sign!

46
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:42,429
-Is this your first time here?
-It is.

47
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,297
-Hello.
-Hi.

48
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,832
Come on in.

49
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,139
A freshwater marsh clam specialty place.

50
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:56,009
For the record, back when I drank,

51
00:02:56,076 --> 00:03:00,480
there were so many mornings
when I really craved these clams.

52
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:04,785
What's "jaecheop-guk set meal"?

53
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,086
JAECHEOP-GUK SET MEAL

54
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:08,055
A set meal comes with
a lot of side dishes.

55
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,022
That's amazing.

56
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:12,392
-Here, when you order the set meal…
-Jaecheop.

57
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,428
-…as a banchan or side dish…
-Banchan.

58
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:18,131
…you get braised mackerel.

59
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:22,002
But the real star is the clam.

60
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:24,404
Right. It's interesting.

61
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:27,207
I've never thought
of the freshwater marsh clam as the star.

62
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,443
-I can see that.
-At least in Japan.

63
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,445
It's new for me.

64
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,847
-Should we order?
-Let's do that.

65
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,215
Excuse me.

66
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:37,284
-Over here.
-Yes.

67
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,486
I think I'll get the set meal.

68
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,121
-Me too.
-Let's get set meals.

69
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:44,057
-Two set meals, please.
-Okay.

70
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:46,960
You must get a lot of Japanese visitors.
You understand most of it.

71
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,428
Only roughly.

72
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:51,498
-Thank you.
-Two set meals coming right up.

73
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,902
I think they're from Japan.

74
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,271
Are you from Japan?

75
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,506
-Yes.
-Really?

76
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:02,042
What brought you here?

77
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:05,579
We came here several times.

78
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:06,513
The food's delicious.

79
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,115
How did you find this place?

80
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,016
We stumbled upon this place
a few years ago.

81
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,651
Mind if we sit together?

82
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,654
-Sorry, excuse us.
-You found it by chance?

83
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:18,458
-When did you first come here?
-How many years has it been?

84
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,961
-I think it's been over ten years.
-Thank you.

85
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,797
You've been coming here
for ten years already.

86
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,066
-Sorry. Make that 20.
-Twenty years?

87
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:29,302
What got you so hooked?

88
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,871
-The clams.
-Really?

89
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:35,242
We also eat these clams often in soup.

90
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,209
What's different?

91
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,844
They're delicious.

92
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:40,781
You come all the way here
just to eat this.

93
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,048
You could say that.

94
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,583
That's really something.

95
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,685
-Where in Japan are you from?
-Fukuoka.

96
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,387
That's close.

97
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,422
-I'm from Fukuoka.
-Quick question.

98
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,325
Is Mr. Matjjigae a hero in Fukuoka?

99
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:55,128
-Of course!
-A superstar from Fukuoka.

100
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:57,097
It's not like that.

101
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,600
All right. Thank you.

102
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,803
Enjoy your meal. Thanks for your time.

103
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:03,970
Excuse us. Thank you.

104
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:07,340
Enjoy your trip. Thank you.

105
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,342
That's amazing.

106
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,947
By the way, the side dishes here
are incredible.

107
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,616
-Very Korean-style.
-Yes.

108
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:20,220
-They're here.
-Indeed.

109
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:23,857
-Looks amazing.
-Japchae and bean sprout salad.

110
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:26,193
-Fruit salad.
-Apple salad.

111
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,395
And that's… Is it squid?

112
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,429
4. SALTED SQUID

113
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:33,033
Salted squid. And that's seaweed salad.

114
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,067
6. YEOLMU KIMCHI

115
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:35,836
-And this is radish?
-We call it yeolmu.

116
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:37,537
-Young radish greens.
-The tops.

117
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:39,940
7. NAPA CABBAGE KIMCHI
8. AGAR JELLY

118
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,875
-Please try some.
-Bon appétit.

119
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:45,745
-Bon appétit.
-These side dishes are something else.

120
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:47,948
It's a massive spread.

121
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,698
It's good!

122
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,742
It's freshly made.

123
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,377
-It's good.
-Delicious.

124
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:20,113
I figured most side dishes like these

125
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,482
would be prepped ahead,

126
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,451
but some of these are freshly made.

127
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:27,254
Japchae, stir-fried glass noodles,
is the best when it's freshly made.

128
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,790
What's this?

129
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,526
-Umutgasari or agar jelly.
-Umutgasari.

130
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:37,030
UMUTGASARI
A TYPE OF RED SEAWEED

131
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:40,934
THE BOILED LIQUID OF UMUTGASARI
IS SET AND EATEN IN A JELLY FORM

132
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:51,444
Okay, I'll try the umutgasari.

133
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,316
Metal chopsticks are hard to handle.

134
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,153
Since these are metal,
it's hard for Japanese people.

135
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,855
I'll use a spoon.

136
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,233
I like this.

137
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,835
Each side dish

138
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:18,438
-is made with so much care.
-It's properly made.

139
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:21,875
And you can even get refills.

140
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,209
-This?
-Everything.

141
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,380
The owner said

142
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:31,518
Japanese people often look
like they want refills

143
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,787
but hardly ever ask

144
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,289
because they worry it might be rude.

145
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:38,792
-It's hard for us.
-In Korea, it's fine to ask for more.

146
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:41,928
It's here!

147
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,131
-Careful. It's hot.
-Thanks.

148
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,902
It's a little hot.

149
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,605
A soup like this makes me want
to bathe in it.

150
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,179
Try the radish in this.

151
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:02,215
We simmered it for a long time,
about four hours.

152
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:06,853
It was simmered for over four hours,
so the radish is really flavorful.

153
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,223
I definitely want to try the radish.

154
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:15,895
JAECHEOP-GUK SET MEAL (PER PERSON)
13,000 WON, 1,300 YEN

155
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,632
No one asks for more of this, right?

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,401
-They do.
-Do they?

157
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,804
Looks like some people
actually ask for refills of this, too.

158
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:25,972
This too?

159
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:29,909
-Do you give more if people ask?
-Yes, we offer refills for everything.

160
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,378
You can get refills on this, too.

161
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:42,088
They've picked all the shells out for us.

162
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,923
In Japan, they leave the shells in, right?

163
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,891
That's right.

164
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,895
I've always thought, "Wouldn't it be nice
to pull the meat out of the shell

165
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,597
and just add that?"

166
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,899
All right, let me try it.

167
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:02,842
This is good.

168
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,283
The soup seeps into your core.

169
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:15,388
The broth is not overpowering.

170
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:18,792
It's mild.

171
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,770
It's light and not heavy.

172
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:31,971
It's gentle.

173
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,049
-It's packed with the clam flavor.
-This soup works wonders.

174
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:51,558
I get why someone
would fly in from Fukuoka

175
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:55,128
just to eat this for breakfast.

176
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:58,865
If this were served every morning,

177
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,101
I could stay here for a month.

178
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,469
That's the best.

179
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:13,780
We don't normally have
this much jaecheop broth in Japan.

180
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:16,916
-Yes, the portion is small.
-Very small.

181
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:19,085
-This feels luxurious.
-I know.

182
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,330
This place is good.

183
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,580
Let me get some water.

184
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,385
It's only morning.

185
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,354
They don't have water, so…

186
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:59,325
You know, your liver

187
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:03,630
has just started getting some love,
thanks to the jaecheop effect.

188
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:08,835
This is a trick that daytime drinkers use

189
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:11,104
to avoid being noticed by others.

190
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,273
You pour some into your water cup.

191
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,211
This barley tea is great.

192
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,281
This is it, right?

193
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,652
It smells like a dad in the morning.

194
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:28,922
That savory smell.

195
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:33,193
It's that "morning dad breath" smell.

196
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,397
It feels like taking off makeup
while putting on makeup.

197
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,499
This is exactly what I wanted.

198
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:42,268
Switching between booze
and a healing soup.

199
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,007
I feel healed.

200
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,381
I just got stabbed.

201
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,187
I'm all better now.

202
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:02,722
I don't even know what you're saying.

203
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,334
I go to Japan so often
that I catch myself lifting my bowl.

204
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:16,436
Isn't that so funny?

205
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,471
I never used to do it.

206
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:22,041
If you eat like this over there,
people stare.

207
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,644
So you end up lifting the bowl.

208
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:30,316
I go to Japan so often that I find myself
lifting the bowl without realizing.

209
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,452
-In Korea…
-I saw you lift it just now.

210
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:33,453
Right.

211
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,723
Meanwhile, Mr. Matjjigae
keeps his bowl on the table.

212
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,227
That's funny.

213
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,931
Let me try the mackerel.

214
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,485
This is tender.

215
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:08,121
The doneness of the mackerel…

216
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,524
is just right.

217
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:13,192
It stole the show.

218
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,169
Man, the mackerel
is amazing and so soft.

219
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:29,842
Ryosen's mackerel
had a deep, intense umami.

220
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:30,943
Right.

221
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,649
But this one's got a stronger flavor.

222
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:40,553
I think they added
a bit of Cheongyang chili.

223
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:45,024
And extra chili powder.
There's radish in here, too.

224
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:49,495
It's very buttery and tender.

225
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,504
You know…

226
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:04,444
I want to pack this in a lunchbox
and eat it for lunch.

227
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:11,017
They don't do takeout or delivery here.

228
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:14,120
You can only eat this
here at the restaurant.

229
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:17,290
You can't take this to-go?

230
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,491
-No.
-For real?

231
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:21,561
My father would love this.

232
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,697
My father isn't into red meat.

233
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:29,669
He always had grilled salted fish
or braised mackerel.

234
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,071
He liked…

235
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:34,941
wrapping the mackerel in lettuce

236
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,609
and eating it as a ssam.

237
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,544
Isn't that interesting?

238
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,414
People usually make ssam with pork belly.

239
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:43,049
But he makes ssam with fish.

240
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,518
With various side dishes inside.

241
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:57,163
-Is it good?
-This is great, too.

242
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,299
What's this?

243
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:11,177
-Are these two different?
-This is ssamjang, and this is…

244
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,445
SSAMJANG

245
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,480
What's this? Some salted seafood?

246
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,550
That one's for the ssam.

247
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:21,120
There's kelp and two other things

248
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:22,388
to make ssam with.

249
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,257
KELP SSAM SAUCE

250
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,426
Kelp…

251
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,394
This is interesting. How do you eat kelp?

252
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:31,964
You can dip the kelp straight in here,

253
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,699
or Koreans put some rice on it

254
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:35,968
and make a ssam.

255
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,271
Sounds interesting. What's this one?

256
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,106
Steamed cabbage.

257
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:42,508
There you go.

258
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:45,278
I see. You put this in here.

259
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,420
All right.

260
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:55,822
-Enjoy.
-Thanks.

261
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:13,773
It's delicious.

262
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,712
I think the simmered sauce is amazing.

263
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,829
The radish is insane.

264
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,601
The radish is unbelievable.

265
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,236
-It makes you smile.
-True.

266
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:44,971
You can't help but smile.

267
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,539
It's delicious.

268
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:50,610
It is so well-braised.

269
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,744
Totally.

270
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,117
The radish is amazing.

271
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:03,689
I think it's the best radish I've had
in braised mackerel in Korea.

272
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:07,927
The real star of this dish is the radish.

273
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:11,097
-I can't argue with that.
-This is outstanding.

274
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,832
This radish is something else.

275
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,301
This really is insane.

276
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:41,127
I'm going to finish all of this.

277
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:50,937
-It's so tasty.
-This one's great, too.

278
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,055
I'm so glad.

279
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,524
-Delicious.
-I didn't expect it…

280
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:13,960
to be this good.

281
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:18,531
As a Korean, I'd give this place

282
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,901
a ten out of ten.

283
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:23,269
-A ten?
-It's perfect.

284
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,872
Japanese folks will like this, too.

285
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:34,647
There's nothing here
that wouldn't suit the Japanese palate.

286
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,817
Everything's good.

287
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:41,320
But at the end of the day,
the real star here is the clam.

288
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:46,759
It's quietly showing its presence.

289
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:47,927
Humbly.

290
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,230
This one is the top dog.

291
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,567
In the end, I feel like
the jaecheop-guk is the king.

292
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,304
The braised mackerel feels like a general
who's great at winning battles.

293
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,741
And the supporting cast is great as well.

294
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:06,012
-They're doing their job.
-True.

295
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,280
This meal was like your stage.

296
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,249
-What?
-Wasn't it?

297
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,051
-My stage?
-You are the star,

298
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:15,955
but you have a full band and a team

299
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,957
-supporting you.
-That's right.

300
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:20,660
You're doing concerts in Japan soon.

301
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,229
Sung Si-kyung's stage

302
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:24,630
at Pacifico Yokohama.

303
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:27,199
-You don't have to say that.
-October 5th?

304
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,401
Let's double-check.

305
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,403
Yokohama and Osaka.

306
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:34,340
YOKOHAMA: OCTOBER 5TH

-This is so good.
-Insanely good.

313
