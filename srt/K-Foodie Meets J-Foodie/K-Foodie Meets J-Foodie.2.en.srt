1
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:06,106
K-foodie meets J-foodie.

2
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:07,207
It's insane.

3
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:11,011
Where are we?

4
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:13,580
-It's a place called Kamakura.
-I see.

5
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:15,749
KAMAKURAKŌKŌ-MAE STATION

6
00:00:16,078 --> 00:00:19,152
A ROMANTIC MEETING
BETWEEN THE SEA AND A TRAIN

7
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:22,322
FAMOUS AS THE SETTING FOR SLAM DUNK

8
00:00:23,018 --> 00:00:24,825
KAMAKURAKŌKŌ-MAE STATION

9
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:26,627
A RESTAURANT 10 MINUTES AWAY BY CAR

10
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:33,867
-I've never been to Kamakura.
-It's your first time here.

11
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:39,072
In the past, many famous figures

12
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:43,510
and novelists lived here.

13
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:47,047
-So they all lived here.
-It's a luxury residential area.

14
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,783
Living in Kamakura

15
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,754
would be a dream come true
for many famous Japanese figures.

16
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,257
-Amazing.
-The scenery is quite beautiful, right?

17
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:58,392
Right.

18
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,494
This is a café

19
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,931
in the residential area.

20
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:05,999
It looks like a leaf.

21
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,834
How did you find this place?

22
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:10,537
My former makeup artist told me

23
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:14,041
that their cheesecake is delicious,

24
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:17,711
but it's quite expensive
and you need to make a reservation.

25
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:20,480
-I see.
-But it's really good.

26
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,349
It's so good

27
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,718
that she can finish a whole cake
on her own.

28
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:26,420
-Shall we go inside?
-Shall we go inside?

29
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:30,343
This is nice. It's like fall here.

30
00:01:30,468 --> 00:01:31,758
INSANELY GOOD DESSERT SPOT

31
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,461
-Welcome.
-Hello.

32
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:38,932
Are these all the tables?

33
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:40,867
They only have four tables

34
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,070
so you're lucky if there's an empty seat.

35
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,773
You can make a reservation,
but I hear it's difficult to get one.

36
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,676
At this time of day,

37
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,145
you can see the sunset here.

38
00:01:53,676 --> 00:01:56,002
FROM THE GREEN TREES

39
00:01:56,127 --> 00:01:58,619
TO THE RED SUNSET

40
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,887
-This is a good date spot.
-This would be the best.

41
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,756
I don't think it's a spot for two men.

42
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:05,359
Their cheesecake is good.

43
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,395
-It's really good.
-I see.

44
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,697
Is this today's menu?

45
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:13,133
They are today's line-up.

46
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:18,672
All of their cookies
are delicious as well.

47
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:19,873
"Snowball."

48
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,309
-And this is chocolate cake?
-Yes.

49
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:25,646
-And this is the famous cheesecake.
-The famous cake.

50
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,081
WHAT HAVE I BEEN EATING UNTIL NOW?

51
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,916
THE CHEESECAKE OF MY DREAMS

52
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,885
WHY IS IT SO EXPENSIVE?
TRY IT AND YOU'LL KNOW

53
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:33,520
UNBEATABLE IN BOTH TASTE AND PRICE

54
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:37,090
Is that really the price?

55
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,794
The big one is 16,000 yen.

56
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:43,030
The small one is 7,000 yen.

57
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,132
It's the price of a whole cake.

58
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,634
My friend who recommended this place to me

59
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:52,039
would buy a whole small cake
just for herself.

60
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,408
Come to think of it,
there is a hotel called Shilla Hotel,

61
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:57,110
one of the most luxurious hotels in Korea.

62
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,179
And their mango bingsu

63
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:02,049
was trendy for a while.

64
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,384
-How much was it? How much?
-About 80,000 won?

65
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:05,986
Eight thousand yen?

66
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:09,189
People went to the hotel
to have mango bingsu.

67
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:13,260
This place is truly incomparable
to any other.

68
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,461
Thank you.

69
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,096
If you try their cake,

70
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:19,866
it's so good that you can instantly tell

71
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:24,037
whether a cheesecake
is from this place or not.

72
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:29,209
Doesn't it look pretty as well?
It's like a painting.

73
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:30,444
It is.

74
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:32,245
-Where should we sit?
-Here.

75
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,213
Here?

76
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,317
Has this place
been around for a long time?

77
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,786
-We opened 30 years ago.
-Thirty years?

78
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:42,322
We just had our 30th anniversary.

79
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,658
When did you start coming here?

80
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,093
Not that long ago.

81
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,928
About a year or two ago?

82
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:51,698
-Yes, you've visited before. Thank you.
-I came with my wife.

83
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:58,538
Enjoying this beautiful scenery
and eating delicious cheesecake,

84
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,409
wouldn't that be
the best moment of your life?

85
00:04:00,484 --> 00:04:03,409
I would happily pay around 3,000 yen
for scenery like this.

86
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:05,612
-Right?
-So the cheesecake would be 4,000 yen.

87
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:08,048
Not 7,000 yen.

88
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,817
It's located at Mount Kamakura,

89
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:15,355
so it feels different from Tokyo.

90
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,491
So, is this the kind of place

91
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,892
where you say to your wife,

92
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,862
"Don't you crave cheesecake today?
Should we go there?"

93
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,464
-Do you do that?
-I do that quite often.

94
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:28,668
When I want to have a slow afternoon,

95
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:32,439
sometimes there will be
empty seats if I'm lucky,

96
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:36,409
so if they say three o'clock is good,
I say, "Perfect," and head over.

97
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:39,713
On the menu today,
you can get the cheesecake with a drink.

98
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,081
Yes, we'll have that.

99
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:44,785
You can choose between coffee, black tea,

100
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:48,121
or two kinds of noble rot wine

101
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,357
that go well with the cheesecake.

102
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,626
-It's a dessert wine?
-That's right.

103
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:53,660
-It's sweet.
-Yes.

104
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:56,596
To ensure a wine
will go well with cheesecake,

105
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,633
we taste each one
before we serve it to you.

106
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,169
Should we try it then?

107
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,004
We should. We came all the way here.

108
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,006
Black tea wouldn't be enough.

109
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:08,241
-I'll have coffee.
-That's a cheap move.

110
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,410
I don't drink.

111
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,079
-I'll go and get your food ready.
-Thank you.

112
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:18,351
I've never heard of cheesecake
being paired with wine.

113
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,921
It's going to be pretty sweet.

114
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,223
How often do you have something sweet?

115
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,225
There's a saying in Korea

116
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:28,094
that heavy drinkers
don't really like sweet things.

117
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,964
I was like that.

118
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,266
I do have delicious desserts sometimes,

119
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,570
but I don't go out of my way
to go to a dessert shop.

120
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,605
Since I don't drink,

121
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:42,242
I like to finish off a meal
with something sweet.

122
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,744
But cafés in Japan tend to close early.

123
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:50,317
On the other hand, Korea
has a well-developed café culture.

124
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,185
There are cafés everywhere.

125
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,788
When I went to Korea,
I had so many sweet desserts.

126
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:58,158
-I got to have desserts at night.
-Really?

127
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:01,228
-You're serious about dessert.
-I am.

128
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:05,799
Having a sweet dessert every day

129
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,435
is the biggest treat I can give myself.

130
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:12,405
When I went to Korea recently,

131
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:16,843
I got into eating these walnut balls
at highway rest stops.

132
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,445
Walnut balls.

133
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,081
I love walnut balls.

134
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,583
Freshly made walnut balls.

135
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,886
-Once you start eating…
-I can't stop.

136
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:29,756
I end up eating them nonstop.

137
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,224
They're good even when they're cold.

138
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:33,793
I'm really happy you discovered that.

139
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,897
Walnut! Walnut balls.

140
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,398
They're awesome.

141
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:41,735
-The balance of red beans and walnuts.
-Right.

142
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:43,670
I envy Koreans

143
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,573
for being able to have them every day.

144
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:52,345
Anyway, if I visit a rest stop now,
the owner remembers me.

145
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,614
"Hey, Walnut Balls!"

146
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:57,584
There's a really good walnut ball place
near Yaksu station.

147
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:00,754
-Where?
-I'll take you next time.

148
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:02,722
Really? It doesn't have to be high-class.

149
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,658
It's not high-class at all.

150
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:05,825
Is that so?

151
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,062
-It's here.
-Yes.

152
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:10,797
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

153
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,065
Here you go.

154
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,971
Is this it?

155
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:22,676
This cheesecake was praised
as the most expensive and delicious

156
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:28,214
by a famous Japanese culinary researcher.

157
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:34,487
This cake is made
by skilled professionals using a recipe

158
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:38,591
carefully crafted
by its inventor, Fusako Holthaus.

159
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:41,494
-What's this?
-This is "Justice" from 2019.

160
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:42,862
It's not olive oil?

161
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,098
-It's a noble rot wine.
-Right.

162
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,299
Excuse me.

163
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,171
Noble rot…

164
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,840
What is a noble rot wine?

165
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,241
"Noble rot wine."

166
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,176
SEARCHING

167
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,044
Hold on. Noble rot wine…

168
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:01,982
It's a wine that is sweetened

169
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,883
by heavily fermenting grapes.

170
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,151
NOBLE ROT WINE

171
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:08,108
MADE FROM GRAPES AFFECTED BY
THE BENEFICIAL NOBLE ROT FUNGUS

172
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,728
Our cheesecake
may look like a rare cheesecake,

173
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,297
but it is baked at a low temperature
for a short time.

174
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,334
Was the cheesecake cooked
sous-vide at a low temperature?

175
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:24,471
It's baked at a low temperature
for a short time,

176
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:27,907
so it still has a fresh flavor to it.

177
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:32,645
Is there a special way to eat
such an expensive cheesecake?

178
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,117
Yes. The white part on top is sour cream
and the middle is cream cheese.

179
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,819
-The bottom is graham crackers.
-Graham crackers?

180
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,922
-You should try all three layers at once.
-I see.

181
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:46,659
So not just the top or the middle,

182
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:47,961
but cut it vertically.

183
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,195
Well… Yes.

184
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:52,365
-You can tell if you just look at it.
-I'm sorry.

185
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:55,635
Do we drink the wine first
or after the cake?

186
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,771
-Just eat however you want.
-I'm sorry.

187
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:01,341
-Thank you for the food.
-Enjoy.

188
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,210
Go ahead.

189
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,847
Look at how soft it is.

190
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:20,693
It's good.

191
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:29,269
What you just ate is worth 400 yen.

192
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,570
Just eat.

193
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,876
Oh, this is cheese.

194
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:52,292
The more you chew, the more
you'll be able to smell the cheese.

195
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,594
What do you think?

196
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:09,375
This is really good.

197
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,311
It's good, right?

198
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,313
-It is.
-That's good.

199
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,416
This crispy,

200
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:21,921
-cinnamon-flavored crust is exquisite.
-The graham crackers?

201
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,724
-It's crunchy.
-When the cheese flavor feels too strong,

202
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,593
I think, "It's not just cheese."

203
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,561
But when it doesn't taste
like cheesecake, then…

204
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,598
There are sweet granules

205
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:36,035
within the graham cracker,

206
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,938
that burst gently in your mouth
alongside the tangy cheese.

207
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:42,642
-Right.
-There's a smooth yet vibrant sensation.

208
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:46,646
And the salt seasoning
is perfectly balanced.

209
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:51,184
The rich cheese aroma
and the sweet scent of cinnamon

210
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:54,287
are perfectly complemented
by the salty flavor.

211
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,658
It is really well-balanced. My apologies.

212
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,529
-Saying this in front of Goro…
-It's fine. Really.

213
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:07,500
Simply put, cakes like this
aren't about logic.

214
00:11:08,396 --> 00:11:11,358
TRYING THE DRINK PAIRED WITH THE CAKE

215
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,943
-Not bad.
-Really?

216
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,545
It tastes sophisticated.

217
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:19,579
NOBLE ROT WINE

218
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,527
It tastes good with the cheesecake.

219
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,253
It's refreshing.

220
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,757
Is it different from what you imagined?

221
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,493
There's a slightly bitter
and tangy flavor.

222
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:34,861
It's not just sweet.

223
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,341
It's extravagant.

224
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,044
It's insane.

225
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,335
If I have this with coffee…

226
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,718
-I'd keep eating.
-You'd keep eating.

227
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,386
You can never have enough.

228
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:17,837
I'm so happy right now.

229
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,608
-It's the perfect time to come here.
-It is.

230
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,481
This is my favorite time of day.

231
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:30,183
What do you normally do at this time?

232
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:33,152
Do you always think about

233
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:36,055
music or writing songs?

234
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:39,225
Well, I'm not the kind of writer
who, like you,

235
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:42,662
focuses intensely
in the moment and thinks,

236
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,131
"I'll go home, gather my thoughts,
and reflect."

237
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,833
I'm always thinking,

238
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:49,369
sitting down to work, then thinking again.

239
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,104
-It must be tiring.
-Yes.

240
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:54,374
You hardly ever decide
to take a full day off, right?

241
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:57,043
I'm not sure how to take a day off.

242
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,312
Oh, my… Are you okay?

243
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,014
You're going to die young at this rate.

244
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:04,550
-You shouldn't work too hard.
-I'm going to live long.

245
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,119
Really?

246
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,955
I never expected to hear
that I'd die young.

247
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:14,294
-"You're going to die young."
-Your life has just started.

248
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:17,096
-I'm 16 years younger than you.
-Then…

249
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,966
-Well, 16 years ago, I--
-But I'm still single.

250
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:22,101
-You have grandchildren, right?
-I do.

251
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,904
It's not something to cry about.

252
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,206
It really isn't.

253
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,742
But…

254
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:35,181
I don't feel offended
even after hearing such a sad story

255
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,849
-because I'm eating this.
-Right.

256
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,121
It's not that I can't marry.

257
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,656
Do you want to get married?

258
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:47,960
I have no one to marry,
and I don't mind being single.

259
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,963
As long as there's delicious cake.

260
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:54,767
Right. It's different for everyone.

261
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,804
-It's quite rich.
-Our conversation?

262
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:00,807
No, the cake.

263
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,409
It tastes rich.

264
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:06,546
Since it's quite pricey,

265
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:09,048
the baker wants you to fully enjoy it.

266
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:12,151
You can't have
such a luxurious cake at home.

267
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,686
That is enough.

268
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:18,157
If you have a girlfriend
who likes cheesecake,

269
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,293
I think it'd be nice to bring her here.

270
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:23,429
It would be nice
to bring your girlfriend here.

271
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,665
-Yes.
-And give her a ring.

272
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:28,901
It would be nice to do that here.

273
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:31,504
You could hide it in the cake.

274
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:33,706
"What is this?"

275
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,276
"I chipped my tooth."

276
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:42,215
I guess old-fashioned jokes like this
are funny in Japan as well.

277
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,183
I enjoy making such jokes.

278
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:48,855
Anyway, I'm Korean,

279
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:54,460
so I would normally just ask
if you'd like to exchange LINE IDs.

280
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:56,362
But I was worried it might be rude here.

281
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,831
-I was worried you'd say no.
-You want to exchange LINE IDs?

282
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:01,734
-Would you be okay with that?
-Of course. I'm fine with it.

283
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:04,370
-I don't want to sound rude.
-Not at all.

284
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:06,339
But I might ignore your messages.

285
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,274
That's a bit harsh.

286
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:10,510
-I found you.
-Yes.

287
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,378
"Add friend."

288
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,080
-Did you find me?
-Yes.

289
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:16,115
Can you send me a message?

290
00:15:16,778 --> 00:15:18,885
IT'S SUNG SI-KYUNG. NICE TO MEET YOU.

291
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,887
NICE TO MEET YOU TOO.

292
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:23,356
TWO HOURS SINCE THEY PARTED
AFTER HAVING DESSERT

293
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,558
I'M GETTING HUNGRY!

294
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,561
CAN YOU RECOMMEND A RESTAURANT?

295
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:31,397
YOU SHOULD GO HERE.

296
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:35,101
AOYAMA SHAN WEI
TOKYO, SHIBUYA, SENDAGAYA

297
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,235
ON MY WAY

298
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,805
THE MAO ZEDONG SPARE RIBS ARE A MUST!
I'LL WAIT FOR YOUR REVIEW!

299
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,573
OKAY

300
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:45,545
MATSUSHIGE'S RECOMMENDATION
AOYAMA SHAN WEI

301
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:50,716
It's a Chinese restaurant named
Shan Wei in Sendagaya, Shibuya.

302
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,151
It was on Solitary Gourmet.

303
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:55,688
Mr. Matsushige
recommended this place to me.

304
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,157
He asked me to give him
a review afterward.

305
00:15:58,224 --> 00:15:59,592
-Let's go inside.
-Let's go.

306
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,835
-Welcome.
-Hello.

307
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:06,232
Please sit over here.

308
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:07,870
Thank you.

309
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:12,438
I woke up at 5:30 a.m. today

310
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:14,674
and flew to Japan.

311
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:16,909
I think I'm going
to eat and sleep well tonight.

312
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,545
Then I'll get what he told me to.

313
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,848
I'm not sure what to call him.

314
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:24,417
I can't just call him by his name.

315
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,886
But Mr. Matsushige seems too formal.

316
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:29,989
I'll call him Mr. Matjjigae.

317
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:32,358
-Jjigae, as in stew.
-Matjjigae?

318
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:38,064
I'll have the Mao Zedong spare ribs
which Mr. Matjjigae recommended.

319
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,633
And the Yawaraka Mushidori.

320
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,201
That's probably a braised chicken.

321
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,804
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

322
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:46,839
-One spare ribs please.
-Yes.

323
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,307
-And the braised chicken.
-Sure.

324
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,176
-Thank you.
-I will make sure it's delicious.

325
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:52,612
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Excuse me, sir.

326
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:55,882
Mr. Matjjigae told me
to report back to him,

327
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,850
so I'll send him photos of everything.

328
00:17:00,582 --> 00:17:03,723
STARTING WITH BEER!

329
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,129
I'm so excited.

330
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:15,334
-Green onion oil?
-Wow.

331
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:18,137
Here you go.

332
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,773
Braised chicken
with green onion soy sauce, regular size.

333
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:24,310
Mr. Matjjigae.

334
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,912
BRAISED CHICKEN
1,980 YEN / 18,000 WON

335
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,250
BRAISED CHICKEN WITH GREEN ONION SOY SAUCE
IT SMELLS GOOD!

336
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:35,354
They use green onion oil
in a lot of fish dishes.

337
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:38,558
But this isn't a sea bream
or braised fish.

338
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:39,659
It's chicken.

339
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:40,893
I'm so curious.

340
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,351
SNIFF

341
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,300
It's good.

342
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:49,569
I can just tell.

343
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:58,511
-Welcome!
-Welcome!

344
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,379
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

345
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:11,958
Thank you, Mr. Matjjigae

346
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:15,361
It's delicious and fragrant.
It doesn't taste like braised chicken,

347
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:18,864
but Chinese braised fish.
But it's chicken.

348
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:20,900
I've never tasted anything
like this before.

349
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,637
I think I should have this with rice.

350
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,417
PERFECT WITH RICE

351
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:34,380
What? The bone just…

352
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,721
Chicken bones are really thick.

353
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:46,559
But it breaks easily…

354
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,262
like a biscuit.

355
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,265
It's as if I'm eating a biscuit.

356
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:56,902
This is amazing. How interesting.

357
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,505
How can a chicken bone
just break like this?

358
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:02,041
It was braised for a long time.

359
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:04,770
This texture is so good
it should be illegal.

360
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,713
Your Mao Zedong spare ribs are here.

361
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:10,316
-Please wear gloves when you eat it.
-Okay.

362
00:19:10,445 --> 00:19:12,103
MAO ZEDONG SPARE RIBS
1,580 YEN / 15,000 WON

363
00:19:12,253 --> 00:19:13,819
-Thank you.
-Mr. Matjjigae.

364
00:19:14,382 --> 00:19:18,858
THE MAO ZEDONG SPARE RIBS LOOK SO GOOD!

365
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:22,328
How do you eat this?
Does anyone eat it as is?

366
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,530
Then I will…

367
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,910
Spare ribs are usually…

368
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,080
-thin and small.
-Yes.

369
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:43,783
Our restaurant works with a butcher's shop

370
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:47,753
to source jumbo-sized spare ribs in bulk,

371
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,489
so they are larger
than regular spare ribs.

372
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:53,759
Pork cutlets with bones
were trendy in Korea too.

373
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,662
I'm sure you had it before.
It's called tomahawk pork chop.

374
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,698
This fatty part is really good.

375
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:07,606
-Excuse me, do you have rice?
-We do.

376
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:09,508
I'll have this with rice.

377
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:26,225
The fat is so good.

378
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:30,896
Yes.

379
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:39,305
It feels like
a completely different way of eating.

380
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:50,349
Wow, this is so good too.

381
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,560
Going back and forth is amazing.

382
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,936
In Solitary Gourmet,

383
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,405
when Mr. Matjjigae
eats something like this,

384
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:14,673
he makes these sad eyes

385
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,209
and stares into space while eating.

386
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,021
You know what I mean, right?

387
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:31,390
Narration will be added
saying something like,

388
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,392
"I am a lone wolf."

389
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:40,232
Thank you, Mr. Matjjigae.
The more we meet, the more I like you.

390
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,434
I think he'll like a photo.

391
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,958
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

392
00:21:47,401 --> 00:21:50,543
IT WAS INSANE

393
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:52,578
INSANE!

394
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:53,879
Insane!

395
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:55,047
THE NEXT INSANELY GOOD SPOT

396
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:58,551
A TEAR-JERKING RESTAURANT

397
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,641
THE LEGENDARY YAKINIKU

398
00:22:19,594 --> 00:22:21,594
