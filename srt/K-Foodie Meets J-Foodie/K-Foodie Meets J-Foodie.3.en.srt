YAKINIKU TSURUYA

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,448
K-foodie meets J-foodie.

3
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,817
It's insane.

4
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:19,486
This is the Holy Land of yakiniku.

5
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:21,288
I wanted to come here so badly.

6
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,590
USUALLY PACKED WITH WAITING CUSTOMERS

7
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,492
RESERVED PART OF THE RESTAURANT

8
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,694
-Welcome.
-Excuse us.

9
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:30,297
Hello, come on in.

10
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,699
TODAY'S INSANELY GOOD SPOT
IS RUN BY A KOREAN-JAPANESE OWNER

11
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:35,002
-Come on in!
-Hello.

12
00:00:35,197 --> 00:00:38,438
LEGENDARY YAKINIKU RESTAURANT
FEATURED IN SOLITARY GOURMET

13
00:00:38,767 --> 00:00:42,676
THE PLACE THAT CREATED AN ICONIC SCENE

14
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,276
I am pretty much
a human thermal power plant.

15
00:00:46,675 --> 00:00:50,083
VENTILATION FANS
HAVE BEEN RUNNING FOR 54 YEARS

16
00:00:50,412 --> 00:00:52,798
THE ORIGIN OF THE THICK SMOKE

17
00:00:53,991 --> 00:00:55,856
YAKINIKU: GRILLED MEAT

18
00:00:56,151 --> 00:00:59,693
A DINING CULTURE OF GRILLING VARIOUS MEATS

19
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:01,261
THE RESTAURANT'S SPECIAL DISH

20
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:03,163
I've never tried it.
It's probably not in Korea.

21
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,799
SPECIAL CUT
SHIBIRE

22
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,000
LET'S GO TRY IT

23
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:11,972
EPISODE 3
TEAR-INDUCING TASTE, LEGENDARY YAKINIKU

24
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:15,142
This place has a wild vibe.

25
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,710
I can see that.

26
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:20,080
This kind of yakiniku joint…

27
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:22,382
How should I put it?

28
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,585
When the room is filled with smoke,

29
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,353
-it's a sign…
-Right.

30
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,722
…that the food must be good.

31
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:29,723
I agree.

32
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:33,360
When Koreans visit Japan,

33
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:36,463
do they go to yakiniku places?

34
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:37,598
Yes, many do.

35
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:39,533
-Really?
-We all love it.

36
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,903
Because there's a variety of options,

37
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,606
and the portion sizes
are great for eating alone.

38
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:50,110
It's hard to find a restaurant in Korea
where you can enjoy barbeque alone.

39
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:53,046
I see. Look at the grill we use.

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,982
-It's quite small.
-Right.

41
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:57,884
-Hello.
-Hi.

42
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,519
-It's been a while.
-I know.

43
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,355
-I'd like the same as last time.
-Okay.

44
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,725
-Shibire.
-I've never had it before.

45
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,826
SHIBIRE: CALF THYMUS

46
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,761
-Genghis Khan.
-I like it.

47
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:08,929
GENGHIS KHAN: LAMB MEAT

48
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:10,063
What else did I have?

49
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,633
Last time you came,
you had kalbi and gopchang.

50
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,501
KALBI: SHORT RIBS
GOPCHANG: SMALL INTESTINES

51
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:15,969
-We'll start with that.
-Okay.

52
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:17,871
-And premium cut shimofuri.
-Great.

53
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:18,805
SHIMOFURI: RIB EYE

54
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:21,341
-Does that sound good?
-I like all of them.

55
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,076
Would that be too much for two?

56
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,612
-No, you'll be fine.
-Really?

57
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,781
-He finished them by himself last time.
-I did.

58
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:28,949
Are you serious?

59
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:30,484
MEAT LOVER

60
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,453
Would you like your meat spicy?

61
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,388
-Yes.
-Great.

62
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,189
-I am Korean, so…
-Okay, then.

63
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,992
What about garlic and chili powder
in the dipping sauce?

64
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:40,227
-Please add them in.
-You sure?

65
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:41,528
Yes, both of them.

66
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,865
-Could we get the cabbage too?
-Sure, one cabbage.

67
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:47,934
-Must be tough with cabbage prices rising.
-It is.

68
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,302
-I can imagine.
-Yes.

69
00:02:49,398 --> 00:02:50,370
BOW

70
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:52,472
-There's nothing we can do.
-It must be hard.

71
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,741
-What about drinks?
-Draft beer?

72
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:56,476
-Yes, please.
-One draft beer.

73
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,145
Large or medium?

74
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:00,113
You have the mega size, right?

75
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,214
We do.

76
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,550
-Then I'll try that one.
-Then one mega size,

77
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:05,318
and I'll have a non-alcoholic beer.

78
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,753
Okay.

79
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:08,889
-That will be all.
-Okay.

80
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,925
Korean barbeque
is centered around pork, right?

81
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,127
Pork is more accessible price-wise.

82
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,296
Samgyeopsal or pork ribs.

83
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:19,612
-Samgyeopsal?
-Pork belly.

84
00:03:20,037 --> 00:03:23,437
Do they sell boiled pork belly

85
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,010
at Korean barbeque places?

86
00:03:26,335 --> 00:03:29,042
-Boiled?
-Isn't samgyeopsal boiled?

87
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,644
-That's bossam, boiled pork.
-I see.

88
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,480
It's grilled fresh for barbeque.

89
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,649
Is that so?

90
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,819
Samgyeopsal means three-layer meat.

91
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,055
Fat, meat, and fat again.

92
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:43,857
-That's what it is.
-So three layers.

93
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:46,126
Have you never had grilled samgyeopsal?

94
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,096
I think I have,

95
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:52,332
but I've never been to a restaurant
specializing in samgyeopsal.

96
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,702
There are so many in Korea.

97
00:03:56,236 --> 00:04:02,209
In Japan, samgyeopsal
is more of a side option.

98
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:03,243
No way.

99
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:08,048
-Right?
-It is the soul of Koreans.

100
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:09,850
-Soul?
-Our comfort food.

101
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,251
Comfort food, huh?

102
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:14,254
I feel like Japanese yakiniku places

103
00:04:14,707 --> 00:04:17,090
are missing the soul of samgyeopsal.

104
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:21,261
Unless they specialize in pork belly,

105
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:25,332
most meat-grilling restaurants
wouldn't have it on the menu.

106
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,033
Look, it's not here either.

107
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,468
You're right.

108
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,937
Thank you for your patience.
Here are your drinks.

109
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,339
-Thank you.
-A mega draft beer,

110
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,609
-and a regular non-alcoholic beer.
-They are here.

111
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,344
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

112
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,813
Cheers.

113
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,548
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

114
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,017
How do you say it in Korean?

115
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:45,552
-Gunbae.
-Gunbae.

116
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,853
It's a bit formal.

117
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,421
-Jjan!
-Jjang?

118
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,090
-It's jjan.
-Jjan!

119
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:51,792
-Jjan!
-Jjan!

120
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:53,393
That was perfect.

121
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,929
Many Japanese people struggle
to say jjan properly.

122
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:58,398
-Many say jjang instead of jjan.
-Jjan.

123
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,734
-Jjan.
-That was great.

124
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,317
He already drank a third of it.

125
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:19,186
Excuse me.

126
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,688
This is the most popular cut, shibire.

127
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:22,722
-Shibire.
-Yes.

128
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,124
SHIBIRE
(890 YEN, AROUND 8,500 WON)

129
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:26,526
THYMUS, A RARE NECK AND CHEST CUT
CREAMY IN TEXTURE

130
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,994
Here's Genghis Khan.

131
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,330
-So this is Genghis Khan.
-It's our signature dish.

132
00:05:30,425 --> 00:05:32,165
GENGHIS KHAN
(1,550 YEN, AROUND 14,500 WON)

133
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:33,767
THINLY SLICED LAMB WITH A SPICY SAUCE

134
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:36,436
This is the tare for beef and lamb.

135
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,504
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

136
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:38,505
TARE: SAUCE

137
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,807
MIX OF SPICY, SWEET, AND SAVORY
THE RECIPE IS A SECRET

138
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,843
-Let's dig in.
-Go ahead.

139
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,978
-I'll start first.
-Please enjoy.

140
00:05:47,943 --> 00:05:51,184
GENGHIS KHAN

141
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,798
When you go to a yakiniku place,

142
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,566
who grills the meat in Japan?

143
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,268
Everyone grills their own.

144
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:10,103
With their chopsticks?

145
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,306
In Korea, things have changed,
but back in the day,

146
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,776
unless someone volunteers
or a senior says, "I'll do it,"

147
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,279
it's usually the junior's job
to grill the meat.

148
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:20,513
Leave the grilling to me.

149
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:21,815
I…

150
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,317
I like grilling it myself.

151
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,386
I enjoy it.

152
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,257
-We have ssam culture in Korea.
-What is that?

153
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:31,825
-Ssam.
-Ssam.

154
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,693
You wrap the meat…

155
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,862
-Ah, I know.
-…with leafy greens.

156
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,698
For friends or family,

157
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:43,536
you could say, "This is so good, try it,"

158
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:46,206
and feed them the ssam you made.

159
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,475
That's our way of showing affection.

160
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:50,710
This is fantastic!

161
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,179
The lamb is amazing.

162
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:54,648
Okay.

163
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:55,949
He's not listening.

164
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,755
-Mmm!
-You're totally absorbed.

165
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:06,626
There's a famous saying in Japan.

166
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:09,863
"I am pretty much
a human thermal power plant."

167
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:11,331
Wait a second.

168
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:12,811
THIS "SAYING" IS…

169
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,136
AN ICONIC LINE FROM SOLITARY GOURMET
GORO'S YAKINIKU SCENE

170
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:21,174
I am pretty much
a human thermal power plant.

171
00:07:21,812 --> 00:07:25,078
THERMAL POWER PLANT MODE

172
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:38,158
I am pretty much
a human thermal power plant.

173
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:39,859
This is so good.

174
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:41,962
Mmm!

175
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,164
It's amazing.

176
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:46,466
This hits the spot.

177
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,169
I've made it as a fan.

178
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,437
Seeing him eating live.

179
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:54,107
HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANT MODE

180
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,280
Is this the sauce?

181
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:04,751
You don't need much.
It's already seasoned.

182
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,858
-This is incredible!
-Right?

183
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,293
I told you.

184
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,563
This is so good.

185
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:19,165
It's been a while since I came here,

186
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:22,102
but the meat here packs a punch.

187
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,939
That's cool. "The meat packs a punch."

188
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,575
I should learn expressions like that.

189
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:32,112
This tare here is amazing.

190
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:33,880
The sauce is insane.

191
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:36,049
I've been to a lot of yakiniku places,

192
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,884
but this tare is special.

193
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,987
When you think of yakiniku tare,

194
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:45,291
it doesn't typically have things
like chili powder or sesame

195
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,894
in the base sauce.

196
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:50,830
But here, they're already in it.

197
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,233
I think they let it mature.

198
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,035
The sauce base is sweet.

199
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,303
This would go well with rice.

200
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,805
You're right. Should we order some?

201
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:00,807
Do you want some?

202
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,942
-Excuse me.
-I shouldn't, but…

203
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,077
Yes?

204
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:05,412
-Can we get some rice?
-Sure.

205
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,314
What size do you want?

206
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,916
Half a bowl for me.

207
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,451
-Me too.
-Two half bowls of rice.

208
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:13,386
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

209
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,889
-I'm going to try the shibire.
-Okay.

210
00:09:16,918 --> 00:09:18,625
SHIBIRE

211
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,393
Which part is this?

212
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,996
It's thymus, so probably around here.

213
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:25,098
AN IMMUNE SYSTEM ORGAN IN A CALF'S CHEST

214
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,067
A SPECIAL PART THAT DEGENERATES IN ADULTS

215
00:09:27,229 --> 00:09:28,368
STARE

216
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:31,738
Why aren't you grilling?

217
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,207
I thought he was doing it for me.

218
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:36,076
Are they both yours?

219
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,977
-Yes, all mine.
-Okay.

220
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,750
The thymus could be tricky to grill.

221
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,418
It's going to burn.

222
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,854
Tell me how long to cook it.

223
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,089
I don't know either.

224
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,758
It should be cooked well enough.

225
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,194
-It'll be fine.
-I've never had it before.

226
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:55,995
It's done enough.

227
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:01,935
Mmm.

228
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,104
Mmm!

229
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:05,905
It's good.

230
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,874
Should I eat this? It looks undercooked.

231
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,576
You're being overly careful.

232
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:11,144
It's fine.

233
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:18,418
Mmm!

234
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,889
-It's delicious.
-He's totally into it.

235
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:25,925
Si-kyung,

236
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,094
you seem to like your meat well-done.

237
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:31,264
I had two while you
were still grilling your first.

238
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,466
The inside isn't fully cooked yet.

239
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,235
You're too cautious.

240
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:40,039
I should have the lamb now.
It cooks quickly.

241
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,575
SAME GRILL, DIFFERENT SPEED

242
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,178
For the first time,

243
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,647
Mr. Matjjigae seems distant
because of the yakiniku.

244
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:49,115
That's not true.

245
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,784
He's gone off on his own
and I can't follow.

246
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,387
He doesn't tell me anything,
and just says, "It looks fine."

247
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:55,788
"I don't know either."

248
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:01,060
He doesn't even look at me.

249
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,495
I was looking at the meat!

250
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:05,465
You know I am Mr. Solitary Gourmet.

251
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,634
Must be the yakiniku effect.

252
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,335
He hasn't looked at me once.

253
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,670
THERMAL POWER PLANT MODE

254
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:11,938
He's not even listening.

255
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,573
I'll try the thymus.

256
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,607
FULLY COOKED

257
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,648
How is it?

258
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:22,815
Is it done well?

259
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:30,223
For meat like that,
isn't it hard to tell if it's cooked?

260
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,726
What is this?

261
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:34,961
He said, "What is this?"

262
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,063
What do you mean by that?

263
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,170
-I think I like this.
-Oh, good.

264
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,408
What?

265
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,245
This is insane.

266
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:53,279
It's heavenly.

267
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,415
I've never tasted anything
like this before.

268
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,616
Shibire?

269
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:57,584
SHIBIRE

270
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,520
The fat here tastes different
from large intestine fat.

271
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:02,222
-This is kind of sweet.
-Exactly.

272
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,357
You noticed the difference in fat.

273
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:05,792
-Was I right?
-Yes.

274
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,126
Awesome.

275
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:08,995
-I won his approval.
-You got it right.

276
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,699
I wish all Koreans would try this.

277
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,102
I'm not sure if I should say it's chewy…

278
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,272
A Japanese person would say it's squishy.

279
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:20,607
It's squishy.

280
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:23,810
When you chew this, the fat and juice

281
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,347
just spread throughout your mouth.

282
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,716
It's light and sweet.

283
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,252
This is so fascinating.

284
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,522
Excuse me.

285
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,891
-Medium cabbage for you.
-Thank you.

286
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,928
-If you need more dressing, let me know.
-Thank you.

287
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:43,196
Enjoy it with your meat.

288
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,498
CABBAGE (M) (490 YEN, AROUND 4,500 WON)
TOPPED WITH TANGY DRESSING

289
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:48,935
Here's the kalbi and gopchang.

290
00:12:49,064 --> 00:12:52,338
GOPCHANG: BEEF SMALL INTESTINE
(890 YEN, AROUND 8,500 WON)

291
00:12:54,436 --> 00:12:58,144
KALBI: BEEF SHORT RIBS
(1,250 YEN, AROUND 12,000 WON)

292
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,046
Should we change the grill plate?

293
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:02,448
-Okay, I'll change it.
-Thank you.

294
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,350
That was very Japanese of you.

295
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,486
Koreans would say,
"Please change the grill,"

296
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:10,356
but Japanese say, "Should we change it?"

297
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,358
I feel bad asking.

298
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,527
I think…

299
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:16,996
Japanese people prefer
indirect expressions.

300
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:17,930
We do.

301
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:22,101
Instead of, "It's hot,"
they say, "It feels a little warm."

302
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:25,872
If someone offers to open the window,
they'll say, "Would that be okay?"

303
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:28,941
In Korea, we simply ask,
"Can I open the window?"

304
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,477
And respond, "Yes, go ahead,"
or, "No, please don't."

305
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,815
Excuse me, let me change the grill plate.

306
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,551
-Sorry about that.
-I'm sorry.

307
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:42,155
Do we have to apologize
every time you change the grill?

308
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,990
-In Japan, yes.
-Right?

309
00:13:44,211 --> 00:13:45,692
-That's the Japanese way.
-Apologies first.

310
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,927
And here's your rice.

311
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,929
-Pardon? Oh, thank you.
-Be careful, it's hot.

312
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,398
-This is so Korean!
-It really is.

313
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:56,069
KOREAN-JAPANESE OWNER
SERVES RICE IN KOREAN-STYLE STEEL BOWL

314
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,904
This is so cool.

315
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,039
I've never seen this in Japan before.

316
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:02,041
With this type of bowl,

317
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:04,577
I feel like I shouldn't lift it
as we usually would.

318
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:05,745
Because that's the Korean way.

319
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,782
What would Koreans think if I did?

320
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:11,784
"Why is he holding up the bowl?"

321
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,753
Bowls stay on the table in Korea.

322
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,022
-I thought so.
-It's heavy and hot.

323
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,791
That's a big difference.

324
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:19,759
Right.

325
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,695
While it depends on the person,

326
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:24,597
Koreans mainly eat rice with a spoon.

327
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,267
-Is that so?
-We end up using a spoon.

328
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:31,003
But Japanese people use chopsticks
from start to finish.

329
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,995
You have to lift the bowl
for a clean finish.

330
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,577
Do you have
these wooden chopsticks in Korea?

331
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,812
-Yes, we do.
-I see.

332
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,047
I haven't seen them.

333
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,238
Disposable ones come with delivery food.

334
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,620
KALBI

335
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,123
Korean chopsticks are made of steel.

336
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,659
Many Japanese people
find them uncomfortable,

337
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,861
saying they're heavy.

338
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:58,231
The sensation of metal touching the mouth

339
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,600
feels a bit strange.

340
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,734
I see.

341
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,340
I love the sound.

342
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,977
Kalbi is the crown jewel of yakiniku.

343
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:14,213
You can't eat much of it,

344
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:17,283
but the richness of the fat is just…

345
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,052
When you're young,

346
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,555
you want to eat tons and you can,

347
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:24,023
but you don't have the money.

348
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,826
When you get older, you have the money

349
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,195
-but you can't eat much.
-Right.

350
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,229
It's hard to digest.

351
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,065
-That's life, they say.
-Indeed.

352
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,601
But I can still eat it all.

353
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,806
Mr. Matjjigae is different.

354
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,209
Mmm!

355
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,125
This kalbi is amazing.

356
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,264
Mmm!

357
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:12,605
Mmm.

358
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,078
Mmm.

359
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:25,485
I'm really torn about
where to take you in Korea.

360
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:28,421
Where to take Mr. Matjjigae…

361
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,555
WANT TO TREAT HIM RIGHT

362
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,290
-This grill--
-Delicious!

363
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,462
The kalbi is so good.

364
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:40,666
I'm serious.

365
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,370
-I feel lonely.
-Are you having fun?

366
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:46,205
-I said I'm lonely.
-Lonely?

367
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,576
I have so much to talk about,

368
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:53,446
but he is going at his own pace.

369
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:55,882
We can talk all we want

370
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:58,384
when we're having dessert or something.

371
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:02,355
Yakiniku places aren't
for leisurely conversation.

372
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,891
-We could grill slowly.
-No way.

373
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:07,760
These are meant to be wolfed down.

374
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:09,762
-Really?
-Yes.

375
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,899
Even when filming Solitary Gourmet,
I go all in on yakiniku.

376
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:15,101
Once I start, I don't hold back.

377
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,536
And when you're not filming?

378
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,838
It's the same. I eat quickly and go.

379
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,239
-Is that so?
-Yes.

380
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,008
I don't waste time with yakiniku.

381
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:25,278
Let's devour the meat, then…

382
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,579
head to a café.

383
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,181
WE CAN TALK OVER DESSERT

384
00:17:29,752 --> 00:17:32,518
COMING SOON
MR. MATJJIGAE'S GO-TO DESSERT PLACE

385
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,520
We can chat there.

386
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:37,123
Then I'll pick up the pace.

387
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,158
I am going to focus on eating now.

388
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:42,194
When it's time to eat, just eat.

389
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,363
I'll do my best.

390
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,004
-How's the cabbage?
-Nice.

391
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,573
You're right. It's good.

392
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,277
I'm grilling all by myself in the end.

393
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,415
As a true Solitary Gourmet fan,

394
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:07,019
I was thrilled to see
Mr. Matjjigae's grilling technique.

395
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,288
But seeing him completely tune me out

396
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,892
to focus on meat made me realize
what yakiniku is all about.

397
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,027
It's a race against time.

398
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,663
-A race against time, he said.
-Wow.

399
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:22,034
-It's not that profound…
-Stop grilling, it looks done.

400
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,569
It's charring.

401
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:26,772
-I'm finally going for the gopchang.
-Eat it already!

402
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,909
Let me dip it in the sauce one more time.

403
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:33,846
-Let the rice soak in all the extra sauce.
-Exactly.

404
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,319
The rich, fatty taste
fills your entire mouth.

405
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:42,955
Mmm.

406
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,092
So this is gopchang.

407
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:49,195
Wow.

408
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:53,966
The delicious cabbage follows.

409
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,203
Mmm.

410
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,138
This is nice.

411
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:01,574
How was that?

412
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,343
NO WORDS NEEDED

413
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:06,145
That was awesome.

414
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:09,548
The most distinctive feature of this place

415
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,617
-is this sauce.
-Yes, the tare.

416
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:14,987
This tare is well-infused with flavor,

417
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,623
so the sweetness and depth of flavor

418
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,026
make you want more.

419
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,094
When you keep dipping in the sauce,

420
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,097
all the meat juices and fat get mixed in.

421
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,866
All the savoriness of the meat…

422
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,634
-Exactly.
-…is in here too.

423
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,438
This sauce keeps you
going back for more rice.

424
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,320
THE SAVORY TARE STIMULATES YOUR APPETITE

425
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,587
Amazing.

426
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,956
-Mmm.
-So good.

427
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,124
I feel so happy.

428
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:53,325
Delicious.

429
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,029
What?

430
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,601
Excuse me.

431
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:07,640
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

432
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,709
-Can I get a sparkling water?
-Sure.

433
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:14,413
-Mr. Hama is eating out there.
-Who?

434
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,749
Our driver, Mr. Hama,
is having some yakiniku.

435
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,350
I'm glad.

436
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,987
If you come here and don't have some,

437
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:24,156
-that's just sad.
-It is.

438
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:27,426
-Everyone will eat later, right?
-Yes, after the shoot.

439
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,161
Excuse me.

440
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:32,298
Here's your premium shimofuri rib eye.

441
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,700
-That looks premium.
-Doesn't it?

442
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36,602
-Thank you.
-Excuse me.

443
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,239
-How much is this?
-It's 1,650 yen.

444
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:41,907
It's 4,000 won per slice.

445
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:45,244
PREMIUM SHIMOFURI RIB EYE
(1,650 YEN, AROUND 16,000 WON)

446
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:47,012
SHIMOFURI: FROST-LIKE MARBLING

447
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,214
KNOWN FOR RICH MARBLING

448
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,493
-Premium! So luxurious.
-I know.

449
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:02,707
PEEK

450
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:04,497
I can't help but check.

451
00:21:04,892 --> 00:21:05,750
PEEK

452
00:21:05,835 --> 00:21:06,710
It's okay to look.

453
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,069
It's true to its name,
frost-like marbling.

454
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:12,605
All right!

455
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:15,941
-Go ahead.
-Perfect.

456
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,110
Look at this.

457
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,287
Mmm!

458
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:33,192
Incredible.

459
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,094
This is delicious.

460
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:39,732
Mmm!

461
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:44,370
It melted away.

462
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:47,439
He wrapped the rice in the meat.

463
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,684
-It's gone already.
-Already?

464
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:00,519
That was amazing.

465
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,588
It's so good. It just melts in your mouth.

466
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,891
It makes you sad, disappearing so fast.

467
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:09,128
-It was gone in a flash.
-In a fleeting moment.

468
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:10,963
Just like youth.

469
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:13,799
Your twenties…

470
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:15,668
Ah!

471
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:17,536
This is insane.

472
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:18,637
