00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,438
K-foodie meets J-foodie.

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:05,906
This is insane.

3
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:11,078
-We're in Busan.
-Busan.

4
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:12,613
TODAY'S FOODIE DESTINATION
BUSAN

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,648
THE SECOND LARGEST CITY IN KOREA

00:00:15,377 --> 00:00:16,884
A CULINARY PARADISE

00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:23,257
A RICE CAKE SHOP
WITH 44 YEARS OF TRADITION

00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,328
A TTEOKBOKKI PLACE
WITH 45 YEARS OF TRADITION

00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:32,599
EPISODE 27
NO CRIME IN TTEOK'S TWIST

10
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:36,670
-Do you hear the airplane?
-Where is it coming from?

11
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:39,106
-Gimhae Airport, which is Busan's airport.
-Yes.

12
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:40,707
It's close by.

13
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,910
-It means "sea of gold," right?
-Right.

14
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:43,977
-Gimhae.
-Okay.

15
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,812
We had mame daifuku in Kyoto.

16
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,916
In Korean, we call rice cake tteok.

17
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:50,884
-Tteok.
-Tteok.

18
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:54,121
Apparently, there's a famous
rice cake shop

19
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:57,724
-here in Busan that makes them by hand.
-Is that so?

20
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,826
So you can try

21
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,695
-all sorts of tteok there.
-Tteok.

22
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,830
And after tasting those,
we'll have tteokbokki,

23
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,833
one of Korea's most iconic dishes,
made with rice cakes.

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,970
-Does the name tteokbokki come from tteok?
-Yes.

25
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,740
Do they make it here? Are we close?

26
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,509
Don't you smell rice cooking?

27
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:18,712
-I think they're steaming it.
-They are.

28
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:21,348
-Hello.
-Hello.

29
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:22,983
Here comes our drinker!

30
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,318
Nice to meet you.

31
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,320
Nice to meet you. Gosh, "our drinker"?

32
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:27,988
-She called me a drinker.
-Drinker!

33
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:29,790
-You're right about him.
-Nice to meet you.

34
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,459
-Mr. Matjjigae, nice to meet you.
-Hello.

35
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:33,560
You look great.

36
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:35,228
Your skin is amazing.

37
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,430
Really?

38
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,166
All thanks to the rice steam.

39
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,102
I spend a lot of time near the steam.

40
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:44,738
She's around steam every day.

41
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:46,840
The rice nutrients
must be in the steam too.

42
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,242
She's got a thick accent.

43
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,044
Accent? Really?

44
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:53,313
-Is she using Busan dialect?
-Yes.

45
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,351
In Busan, they can't really pronounce
ssal, rice, properly.

46
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,820
It sounds like sal.

47
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,858
The first thing we'll show you
is garaetteok.

48
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,693
-Garaetteok.
-You can put it

49
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:10,430
in tteok-guk, sliced rice cake soup,
or just eat it as is.

50
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:14,434
Back in the day,
it was a beloved snack nationwide.

51
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,203
So she's going to show us

52
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,251
-how it's made?
-Exactly.

53
00:02:18,376 --> 00:02:19,740
-Normally, we make it…
-Yes.

54
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,775
-…early in the morning.
-Right.

55
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:24,544
But since you two were visiting,

56
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,713
I prepared some to demonstrate.

57
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,115
-Thank you.
-Sure thing.

58
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,217
Do you cook the rice?

59
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:32,019
Or steam the rice?

60
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,787
-They steam the rice.
-Okay.

61
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,355
We grind the rice first.

62
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:38,158
We pound the rice
to make it into rice flour.

63
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:39,693
-Grind the rice first?
-Yes.

64
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,961
We steam ground rice.

65
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,600
HOW TO MAKE GARAETTEOK
1. PUT GROUND RICE IN THE STEAMER

66
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:51,271
2. STEAM FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES

67
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,743
3. CUT INTO APPROPRIATE-SIZED PIECES

68
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,845
What do you do after that?

69
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,293
It'll come out as tteok now.

70
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,615
Garaetteok.

71
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,316
-I'll make it tasty.
-Okay.

72
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,752
-"I'll make it tasty," she says.
-Please do!

73
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,489
It's in the machine.

74
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,491
-It's coming out!
-Yes.

75
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,527
What?

76
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,645
That's impressive.

77
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:33,980
This is really delicious.

78
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,916
-Freshly made ones?
-Yes.

79
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,651
They're putting it back in.

80
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,456
So they repeat this process a few times.

81
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,624
How many times
do you repeat this process?

82
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:45,559
Three times.

83
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,793
-Three times.
-Three?

84
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,428
For extra chewiness.

85
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:50,530
-Very chewy.
-To make it extra chewy.

86
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,699
I see. For chewiness.

87
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,436
-So do you only use rice for this?
-Yes. Regular rice.

88
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:57,671
-Plain rice.
-Plain white rice.

89
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,006
-Non-glutinous rice and salt.
-It's made with regular rice.

90
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,942
-White rice.
-Rice and…

91
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:05,011
-Just rice and salt?
-Yes.

92
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,414
-Right. They add salt.
-And water.

93
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:11,818
-Si-kyung.
-Yes?

94
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,153
-Looks good, right?
-Yes.

95
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,821
-Right.
-He has never seen this before.

96
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,957
-Mr. Jjigae, it's your first time?
-First time?

97
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,025
-Yes.
-You can

98
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,995
take a good look
and put it in your belly before you go.

99
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:24,598
Take a good look,
and go back home with a full belly.

100
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:25,665
Okay. I bet it's good.

101
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,634
-I can tell already.
-He said it looks good.

102
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,770
Mr. Jjigae.

103
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,438
You've suddenly become Mr. Jjigae.

104
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:32,706
-Jjigae?
-Yes.

105
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,441
-Jjigae.
-Mr. Jjigae.

106
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:35,976
-Jjigae works for me.
-Here.

107
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,410
-Put these on.
-Mr. Jjigae.

108
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:40,113
-Mr. Jjigae.
-Doesn't it sound cute?

109
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,048
-I don't mind at all.
-Mr. Jjigae.

110
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,751
I was called "Chige" back in Fukuoka,

111
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,686
so "Jjigae" is okay.

112
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,522
-Here.
-Freshly made ones.

113
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,557
Thanks. I can't wait to try it.

114
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,259
It's warm.

115
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:55,228
It's freshly made, so it's quite hot.

116
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,930
Let's try it as is.

117
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,174
Clearly not glutinous rice.

118
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,276
It's rice.

119
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,911
-Can you tell?
-Of course.

120
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,013
He said it's different
from glutinous rice cakes.

121
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,881
-It has that plain rice feel.
-Right.

122
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,583
This is what Korean people love.

123
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,552
What should we dip this in?

124
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:22,222
In my house,
we dipped it in soy sauce and sesame oil.

125
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,757
SUGAR, HONEY, SESAME OIL, SOY SAUCE

126
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,659
SI-KYUNG'S RECOMMENDATION
SESAME OIL + SOY SAUCE

127
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,227
What's the usual dip in Busan?

128
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:29,296
Honey.

129
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:33,900
-My father's from Busan.
-Really?

130
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:35,635
But in my house,

131
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,571
it's always sesame oil and soy sauce.

132
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,873
-We eat it like that too.
-Really?

133
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,741
Si-kyung, go ahead and enjoy.

134
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,579
Wait, soy sauce and sesame oil?

135
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,147
Try it.

136
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:49,983
This is tasty.

137
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:57,557
Have as many as you like.

138
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:58,692
It's delicious.

139
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,227
I feel like

140
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,630
this could evolve
into something delicious.

141
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,831
It can be a proper dish.

142
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,299
It's pure white.

143
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,035
Like a blank canvas
waiting to be drawn on.

144
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,905
And you can color it red.

145
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,640
Then it becomes tteokbokki.

146
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,242
You can also deep-fry it.

147
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,343
-Deep fry it?
-Yes.

148
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,644
Fried rice cake.

149
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,614
I bet the inside will be chewy
and the outside crispy.

150
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,682
-Exactly as you said.
-Sounds delicious.

151
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:26,386
-How do you eat it when it cools down?
-What do you do when it cools down?

152
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,989
When it cools and hardens…

153
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,625
-With a knife?
-…you slice it like this,

154
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,545
-and make tteok-guk.
-Cut into oval shapes.

155
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,162
-Sliced rice cake soup.
-You can boil it in broth.

156
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,530
It's delicious.

157
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,267
-We eat tteok-guk on the Lunar New Year.
-Like dumpling soup.

158
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:44,104
Is this the same rice cake
they use in Korean cooking classes

159
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,240
-that's added to hot pot dishes?
-Yes.

160
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:48,341
So this is it!

161
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,877
This is the one sliced into round shapes.

162
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,814
These are a must
for the Lunar New Year in Korea.

163
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,216
It holds the same place in Korea

164
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:58,285
-as mochi does in Japan.
-Exactly.

165
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,620
But this isn't the only rice cake we have.

166
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,956
There are many other delicious kinds.

167
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,291
-Shall I introduce them?
-Please.

168
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,425
-That would be great.
-Okay.

169
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:06,426
Then please go that way.

170
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:09,329
-She said there are other kinds.
-Let's go see.

171
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:10,797
-This way.
-This way?

172
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,565
-Yes.
-Okay.

173
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:17,404
-It was delicious.
-I've never had freshly-made rice cake.

174
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:23,343
What vibrant colors!

175
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,345
-There are so many kinds.
-That's right.

176
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:26,746
I see one coated with bean powder.

177
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,316
-Mugwort mochi.
-Daifuku made with mugwort.

178
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,419
-Mugwort glutinous rice cake.
-I know this one.

179
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,554
This is famous in Japan.

180
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,623
-Daifuku.
-This is Korean-style mochi.

181
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,724
-Yes.
-And this is--

182
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,059
Isn't this minazuki?

183
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,161
It looks similar but tastes different.

184
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,629
Japan also has something like this.

185
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:45,999
This one has red bean, honey, and peas.

186
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,735
When Japanese tourists come here,

187
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:52,472
I deliver these a lot to the airport.

188
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,407
They're extremely popular
among Japanese people.

189
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,677
Yes, Japanese people love this one.

190
00:07:57,744 --> 00:08:01,014
-This one has mugwort in it.
-This one?

191
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,717
It's jeolpyeon,
made with regular rice and mugwort.

192
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,285
This is also delicious.

193
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:09,255
Would you like to try it?
How much is this one?

194
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:10,290
It's 3,000 won.

195
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:11,691
-It's 300 yen per pack.
-Yes.

196
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,860
-That's cheap.
-I know.

197
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,162
If you buy four,
it's 1,000 yen, 10,000 won, right?

198
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,365
It's written here.

199
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,066
-It's 10,000 won for four?
-Yes.

200
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:21,267
You're right. You're quick.

201
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,902
-I mean…
-You catch these things fast.

202
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,938
The first thing I want to know
is the price.

203
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,139
ONE 3,000 WON
FOUR 10,000 WON

204
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,141
-What should we get?
-Let's choose.

205
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,910
We have to get the daifuku.

206
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:34,347
-I want to try it.
-I bet it's good.

207
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:36,483
And the one that looks like minazuki.

208
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,918
Should I try this mugwort one?

209
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,587
-This one--
-Mugwort mochi.

210
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,023
-Let's go with the mugwort ones.
-Sounds good.

211
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,891
-Then we'll take these.
-That's all.

212
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,426
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

213
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:47,360
Thank you.

214
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:48,661
FOUR PACKS
10,000 WON, 1,000 YEN

215
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,364
-Would you like to eat some inside?
-We'd love that.

216
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,033
-It's so hot outside.
-Please come in.

217
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,402
-Can we eat inside?
-Yes, let's head inside.

218
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,871
Let's go.

219
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,040
-You have misutgaru.
-Yes, we do.

220
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,041
BUSAN RICE CAKE MILL

221
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,275
There's a traditional drink

222
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:04,978
-called misutgaru.
-"Misogaru"?

223
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,279
-Misutgaru.
-Misutgaru.

224
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,714
-Garu means powder.
-Okay.

225
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:08,882
-Rice…
-Rice.

226
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:13,286
…brown rice, and other grains
are lightly roasted

227
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:17,490
and ground to a fine powder
and added to water to drink.

228
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:19,859
It's nutty and tasty.

229
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:22,695
-Nutty? I can't imagine.
-There's misutgaru.

230
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:24,731
What do you use to make misutgaru?

231
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:25,865
For misutgaru,

232
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:29,035
we use 11 kinds of Korean grains.

233
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,504
-For summer…
-She uses 11 kinds of grains.

234
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,740
…this is better than a meal when it's hot.

235
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,775
This is better for your body than rice.

236
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,144
This is really…

237
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:42,148
It looks like milk coffee.

238
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:44,284
He said it looks like milk coffee.

239
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,385
-Let's try it.
-Thank you.

240
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:47,320
-Thank you.
-Sure thing. Please enjoy.

241
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:50,190
If it tastes good, say "jwigine,"
meaning "This is killer!"

242
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,158
Jwigine?

243
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,998
Jwigine!

244
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:03,536
-This is nice. And nutty.
-I'm glad.

245
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:06,639
This is the real deal.

246
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,675
Back in the day, in summer,

247
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,677
we'd cool off after a shower

248
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:15,415
by sitting in front of a fan
and drinking iced misutgaru together.

249
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:16,983
Nice. With ice.

250
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:18,952
So, what should we eat first?

251
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,020
-First…
-I knew it.

252
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,523
…let's start with the one
with nothing added first.

253
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,659
I noticed that in Korea, people often

254
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,695
-cut different foods with scissors.
-That's fun.

255
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,396
I like it.

256
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,733
-There.
-Good.

257
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,736
-There.
-Good.

258
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,238
All done.

259
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,573
-There you go.
-Thank you.

260
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,543
-This is plain mugwort rice cake.
-Right.

261
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,586
It's good.

262
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,422
The aroma hits you as you chew.

263
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,459
Mugwort rice cakes in Japan

264
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:03,029
feel more like a snack.

265
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:06,733
-They're sweet and sugary.
-That's right.

266
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,168
This is not like that at all.

267
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,136
It's seasoned with salt,
not with soy sauce.

268
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,271
Right. Salt.

269
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:15,808
I can imagine using it
in different recipes.

270
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,612
But I don't think I've seen dishes
that use mugwort rice cake.

271
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,182
For one thing,
the mugwort flavor is strong.

272
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,850
-So you just eat it as is?
-Yes.

273
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:26,619
-That's interesting.
-Right?

274
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:29,522
Shall we split it?

275
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,292
I'll take a bite and leave you half.

276
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,395
But then it'll be an indirect kiss.

277
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,099
-Do you want an indirect kiss?
-No.

278
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,501
I didn't mean that I want one.

279
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:44,971
Do people say things like,
"That counts as an indirect kiss"?

280
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,407
-Everyone's laughing.
-We used to say that back in the day.

281
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:03,556
This is

282
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:05,325
properly salted.

283
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,262
-The seasoning's there.
-Yes.

284
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:11,097
But no beans.

285
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:13,066
-Japanese mame daifuku…
-Beans--

286
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:15,535
…has whole peas stuck inside.

287
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,270
Whole peas are embedded in the mochi,

288
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:21,074
hence the name, mame daifuku,
bean-studded rice cake.

289
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,910
I guess this is basic daifuku.

290
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,812
Yes, so we call it chapssaltteok.

291
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,714
Chapssal is glutinous rice.
Tteok is rice cake.

292
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,019
But on the other hand,

293
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:37,257
the red bean paste here
is ground rather coarsely,

294
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:38,791
so there's texture.

295
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,995
The red bean paste still has
whole beans in it, which I like.

296
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,429
This is good.

297
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,833
It's definitely better

298
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:50,670
to hear from someone older
rather than young people

299
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,272
when it comes to rice cakes.

300
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:53,606
-Tteok master.
-Come on.

301
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:55,270
-Young people eat these, too.
-I am

302
00:12:55,345 --> 00:12:57,343
-the squid master. He's the tteok master.
-Okay.

303
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,545
Young people these days
are all about bread.

304
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,614
-But in my family…
-What's it like in Japan?

305
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:05,084
My grandkid loves red bean paste.

306
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:10,023
Surprisingly, my wife hates it.

307
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,724
She's an anti-red bean paste person.

308
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,060
-An anti-red bean paste person?
-But apart from her,

309
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:18,731
everyone in the family loves it,
even the kids.

310
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,802
What's this called?

311
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:24,137
Patwandu-baegi.

312
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,505
Let's drop it. It's too hard.

313
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:26,673
I could never pronounce it.

314
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,841
"Patdagumbari?"

315
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,083
It's not all that sweet.

316
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,017
That's why it's nice.

317
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:39,419
Other ones were sweet,

318
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:42,255
-so this is a nice change.
-It's not sweet.

319
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:45,758
It's just the natural sweetness
of the red beans.

320
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,328
When you chew it,
you get a more refined kind of sweetness.

321
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,663
It's not the kind of sweetness
everyone notices right away.

322
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,299
It has an elegant sweetness.

323
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,234
If I had to compare,

324
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,836
it's close to Japanese sekihan.

325
00:13:57,537 --> 00:14:00,206
SEKIHAN, STICKY RICE WITH RED BEANS
SIMILAR TO KOREA'S PAT-CHALBAP

326
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:01,774
EATEN ON CELEBRATORY OCCASIONS

327
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,943
You know what?

328
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,446
-I think I could eat one more.
-Since it's not sweet,

329
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,382
it tastes great even on its own.

330
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,223
I like this so much.

331
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,459
But even if I want one,
I can't ask for it.

332
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,094
Patwandu-baegi.

333
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,363
-Patwandu-baegi.
-Yes.

334
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:24,864
How much is "batwandu-baegi"?

335
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:27,133
-No, it's pat.
-Pat.

336
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,601
Batwandu-baegi. Pat!

337
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:29,969
Patwandu…

338
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:31,504
That was right.

339
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:34,140
I forget right away.

340
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,309
This goes well with tteok.

341
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:37,677
And you can feel it in your mouth

342
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,713
-that it'll be good for you.
-Right.

343
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:44,484
But you know how
anything good for you tastes bad.

344
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,386
If it tastes good,
it's definitely bad for you.

345
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,321
Because you only eat stuff
that's bad for you.

346
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,257
Even here, the lady called you a drinker.

347
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:52,859
-A drunkard…
-She called me that

348
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,395
out of love, on purpose.

349
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,530
Like, "I watch you on TV."

350
00:14:57,597 --> 00:15:00,366
"I know what you like."

351
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,702
"Are you okay, always drinking like that?"

352
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,339
-"Drink something like this instead."
-Now that you mention it…

353
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,008
Didn't you use to drink quite a lot?

354
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,044
-Come on, you did too.
-Right.

355
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,413
-Quite a lot.
-Quite a bit.

356
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,014
I didn't like people who didn't drink.

357
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,149
Right?

358
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,384
Please think of me

359
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:19,852
-as your past self.
-But

360
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,755
now that I quit
both smoking and drinking,

361
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:24,791
I've parted with my past self.

362
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:31,097
So you've had tteokbokki many times
on Solitary Gourmet

363
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,633
and also at street stalls, right?

364
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:38,438
This is pretty spicy.

365
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,941
It's already
quite a popular dish in Japan.

366
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:44,444
Right, we're going to eat tteokbokki now.

367
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,679
There are two types of tteokbokki.

368
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:50,316
It's either made with wheat tteok
made from wheat flour,

369
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:55,455
or rice tteok made from rice flour,
like the one we ate today.

370
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,256
There's a wheat flour version?

371
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,058
I'm actually on Team Wheat Tteok.

372
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,359
Really?

373
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,662
Wait, then what is the tteokbokki

374
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,531
we usually have made with?

375
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,400
Was the tteok thinner

376
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,901
-than what we just had?
-Yes.

377
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,102
That's made with wheat flour.

378
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,671
-Is that so?
-Yes.

379
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,239
What about where we're going next?

380
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,542
-They use the rice version. Garaetteok.
-Let's go.

381
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:25,151
TTEOKBOKKI PLACE WITH 45 YEARS OF MEMORIES

382
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,726
This is the place.

383
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,261
Red Tteokbokki.

384
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,662
-Hello.
-Hello.

385
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,898
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

386
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:41,033
-The color…
-Red!

387
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,002
Is this the legendary red tteokbokki?

388
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,770
So this is the famous red tteokbokki?

389
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,807
Wow, the color is intense. Bright red.

390
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:49,442
This place has been around for 44 years?

391
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,078
About 45 years.

392
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:56,349
Is it mostly students who eat tteokbokki?

393
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,084
Students eat it a lot, yes.

394
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,454
Back in the day, they'd pick up the tteok
and eat straight from the pan.

395
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,122
but now you can't do that.

396
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,324
-It's served on plates.
-We serve it on plates.

397
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,793
In the past, you paid a certain amount

398
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,929
-and were told to eat about ten pieces…
-From the pan?

399
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:11,130
Really?

400
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:12,532
This is…

401
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:13,699
Do they have sundae, too?

402
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,368
Sundae, tteokbokki, fish cake.

403
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,904
-Let's order everything.
-Sounds good.

404
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,106
-One of each, please.
-One of each.

405
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,307
-One serving each?
-Yes.

406
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:22,875
Take a look.

407
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,777
FILMED WITH PERMISSION FROM THE STORE

408
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,279
That is really red.

409
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:28,481
How do you make it so red?

410
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,116
We make our own gochujang.

411
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:33,119
The store-bought kind
is too salty and spicy, and no good.

412
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,921
Store-bought gochujang

413
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:38,524
is too sweet and salty,
so it doesn't go well with tteokbokki.

414
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:41,394
So this sauce is unique to this place.

415
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,662
That's right.

416
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,200
Thank you.

417
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,736
Thank you.

418
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:54,106
-How much is it?
-It's 350 yen per serving.

419
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,709
TTEOKBOKKI (ONE SERVING)
3,500 WON, 350 YEN

420
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:00,580
SUNDAE (ONE SERVING)
4,500 WON, 450 YEN

421
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:04,016
FISH CAKE (PER SKEWER)
1,000 WON, 100 YEN

422
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,319
That's affordable.

423
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:10,623
-Students mainly come to eat this.
-I see. No wonder it's cheap.

424
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,093
You know,

425
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,597
-student uniforms are white.
-Yes.

426
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,999
Tteokbokki must be tricky to eat.

427
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:21,667
-Not everyone…
-Right?

428
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,636
…is a fashionista like you.

429
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,371
Even if you're not a fashionista--

430
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,840
They'll just say,
"Oh, it got dirty. I have to wash it."

431
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:30,843
You'll definitely hear,
"You've been eating tteokbokki, right?"

432
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:31,811
For sure.

433
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:34,914
If you talk while eating,
it would spill everywhere.

434
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:37,283
I might be so shocked
that I can't recover.

435
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,752
I don't know how it would make you feel,

436
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:44,023
but when you're young,
you don't spill much while eating, right?

437
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,693
-Why is that?
-It's a mystery to me.

438
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,196
-When you get older…
-Do you spill food?

439
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:51,797
-I do.
-Right?

440
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,132
You know, right?

441
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:55,201
-At this age, I spill every day.
-Yes, every day.

442
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:58,404
I don't think I ever spilled food
in my twenties.

443
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,672
Same here.

444
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,077
How do you eat this tteokbokki?

445
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,445
-Teach me how.
-However you want.

446
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,047
Just poke the middle.

447
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:09,649
-In the middle?
-Yes.

448
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:16,455
How is it? Does it suit your taste?

449
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:20,826
You said you were a wheat tteok person.

450
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,428
It's a little sweeter.

451
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,629
-Sweet?
-Yes.

452
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,398
-I think you'll like this.
-But look.

453
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,199
Look at the color. It's sweet?

454
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,801
Yes. It's not that spicy.

455
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,603
-Are you sure?
-And

456
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,104
rice tteok

457
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,373
don't soak up seasoning well,

458
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,444
So the sauce for rice tteok tteokbokki
is made stronger.

459
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,213
Let me try it.

460
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:50,056
It's not spicy at all.

461
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,757
Yes, it's sweet.

462
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:53,893
This sauce

463
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,662
has a sort of chili pepper aroma

464
00:19:57,096 --> 00:20:01,000
that hits your nose
with a unique fragrance,

465
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,502
making it feel a bit fresher

466
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:06,572
-than the usual tteokbokki.
-Right.

467
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:10,810
Rather than being fully absorbed
into the sauce,

468
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,479
the chili pepper aroma
comes through separately.

469
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:17,349
The tteok and sauce
aren't fully melded together.

470
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,317
Rice tteok tteokbokki

471
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:21,387
features pure white rice cakes

472
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:25,391
drenched in a rich, bold sauce.

473
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,894
-We just had tteok earlier.
-Yes.

474
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:33,165
So knowing how the tteok is made,

475
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:37,870
I get that tteokbokki is meant to be
enjoyed with the sauce coating the tteok.

476
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:41,874
Yes. Rice tteok tossed in sauce.

477
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:47,179
I'd say a third of students' blood
is made of tteokbokki.

478
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,948
That much?

479
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,449
What would be the other two-thirds?

480
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:52,151
Curiosity.

481
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:54,787
That's very vivid.

482
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,757
-I mean, they're young.
-That's true.

483
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,626
You're still young, Si-kyung.

484
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:03,395
-Barely hanging on to it.
-Right?

485
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,204
I'll try some of this.

486
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:14,440
Sundae.

487
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:18,611
In Seoul,

488
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,346
you dip sundae in salt.

489
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:24,183
In Busan, you dip it in this ssamjang.

490
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,357
I like how people from Kyushu

491
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:34,360
don't mind offal dishes.

492
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:36,495
You eat them without hesitation.

493
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,064
This sundae

494
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,666
doesn't feel very meaty.

495
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:44,003
-It's like konjac.
-Right.

496
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,071
It doesn't taste like intestines either.

497
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:50,576
It's made with glass noodles,
some vegetables, and blood.

498
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:51,877
-Pig's blood?
-Yes.

499
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:56,148
This kind of sundae
runs in Koreans' veins.

500
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:58,083
-It's in all of you.
-Some can't eat it.

501
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,953
About two or three in a hundred

502
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,087
can't eat sundae.

503
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,489
-Really?
-Yes.

504
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:08,427
I guess it's about the same ratio
as Japanese people who don't like natto.

505
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:12,064
Both students and adults
love to dip this into this sauce

506
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:13,599
-like this.
-You dipped it.

507
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,868
It's an all-purpose sauce.

508
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:20,940
So you dip the sundae in the sauce?

509
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:30,182
Can students finish one serving alone?

510
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:31,884
Thinking back 30 years,

511
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:33,819
I don't think I ever felt full.

512
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:35,487
-You didn't feel full?
-No.

513
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:36,722
No matter how much I ate,

514
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:41,026
after about two hours of sleep,

515
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,062
I'd feel hungry again.

516
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:47,733
I'd eat a whole okonomiyaki as a snack.

517
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,370
Compared to that,
I guess you could eat this by yourself.

518
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:54,273
And next time, I want to try
different kinds of sundae.

519
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,275
And different types of tteokbokki too.

520
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:57,476
There's a kind

521
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:01,480
where you cook it yourself
in a pot at your table.

522
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:04,550
There's also a no-soup tteokbokki

523
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:06,585
called gireum tteokbokki,
meaning oil tteokbokki.

524
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:07,586
Oil.

525
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:10,756
There's also royal tteokbokki,
which is more like a stew.

526
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:12,491
The world of tteokbokki is wide.

527
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,760
But tteokbokki used to be

528
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:17,029
all the rage in Japan.

529
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:18,530
Was it?

530
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,099
Was there a reason for that?

531
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,434
-Maybe K-dramas?
-Probably.

532
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:26,505
If you compared tteokbokki
to Japanese food, what would it be?

533
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,942
What is a typical student snack?

534
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:32,878
In Tokyo, monjayaki,
a type of pan-fried batter.

535
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:35,014
I see. Monjayaki.

536
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,716
In western Japan,
okonomiyaki and takoyaki.

537
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:40,019
Takoyaki. I forgot about that.

538
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,656
Students buy those with their allowance
after club activities on the way home.

539
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:46,292
Back in my student days,
it was okonomiyaki.

540
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:51,664
By the way,
before we came into this place,

541
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,065
I heard a good song

542
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:55,000
playing in the waiting area.

543
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:57,002
At the café.

544
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:59,171
I thought, "This is nice."

545
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:03,542
"Hearing this kind of song
at this time of the year

546
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,911
is very refreshing."

547
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:07,212
Okay.

548
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,082
They kept playing my songs
at the café we were waiting at.

549
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:12,351
I was already humming along.

550
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:17,823
I'm sure Japanese people are waiting

551
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,693
to hear that kind of voice as well.

552
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,528
-Wait, come to think of it…
-Yes.

553
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:24,596
-I'm doing a concert.
-What?

554
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,565
-If you have time…
-And if I do?

555
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:29,201
-…can you come to the concert?
-I'll be there.

556
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:30,836
-Really?
-Of course. Where?

557
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,306
It's at Pacifico Yokohama, on October 5th.

558
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:35,541
At Pacifico Yokohama.

559
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:38,744
And Grand Cube Osaka on the 7th.

560
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,245
Nice.

561
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,780
It's close to my home ground,

562
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,282
-FM Yokohama.
-Right.

563
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:45,985
-Is the 5th okay for you?
-I'll check my schedule.

564
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:50,889
You're cold.

565
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:52,591
I'll check.

566
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:53,993
No, I'll come.

567
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:57,563
"I'll come" and "I'll check my schedule"

568
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:00,966
-are the complete opposite.
-You know, people say they'll check first.

569
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:05,170
-I want to go, but…
-Just you saying that makes me happy.
