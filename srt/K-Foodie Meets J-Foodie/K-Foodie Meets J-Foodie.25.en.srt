25
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,323
I just watched your show two days ago!

28
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,328
-Oh, my!
-That's duck meat.

29
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:02,296
Duck!

30
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,465
Oh, my!

31
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:06,867

-Are you a celebrity?
-Yes.

38
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,211
-You are?
-Yes.

39
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:20,681
She just asked, "Are you a celebrity?"

40
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,015
He is.

41
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,450
It's Sung Si-kyung.

UIJEONGBU JEIL MARKET
FAMOUS FOOD SPOT

45
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,995
IT'S LIKE A DEPARTMENT STORE TO ME

46
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:36,363
LOL

47
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,966
WE NEED TO TAKE
BIG BRO MATJJIGAE SOME TIME

48
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:42,102
I told you before
that I'm not into fashion.

49
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:44,237
So department stores

50
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,340
don't excite me at all.

51
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:48,809
-Right.
-But traditional markets like this

52
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,177
make me so excited.

53
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:53,313
Great. I love markets.

54
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,548
Let's go in.

55
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:58,952
What is this?

56
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:00,754
It's tteok. Rice cakes.

57
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:04,691
-You can make tteokbokki with it.
-Really?

58
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:05,726
Yes.

59
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:06,960
What's that?

60
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,296
This is called dakgangjeong.

61
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:11,131
It's similar to fried chicken

62
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,532
but coated in sauce.

63
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,700
Like this.

64
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,904
-What about this one?
-Largehead hairtail.

65
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,106
There are a lot of them.

66
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,307
Right.

67
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,376
These are cuttlefish.

68
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,378
STARING

69
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:27,914
Are you picking up some stuff for dinner?

70
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:30,250
-Are you shopping for dinner?
-Yes.

71
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,184
-She said yes.
-Then…

72
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:34,154
-What looks good today?
-What looks good today?

73
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:36,289
The squid looks nice.

74
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,624
-Squid, maybe?
-Squid.

75
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:38,725
-Largehead hairtail.
-Yes.

76
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:41,028
-I'm still looking.
-She's still looking.

77
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:43,997
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

78
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:44,965
-Thank you.
-Sure.

79
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:46,133
Thank you.

80
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:47,934
-What is that?
-Corn.

81
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,870
-What?
-Corn.

82
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,906
Let's get some. Which one tastes better?

83
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:54,841
-Which one's better?
-Are they different?

84
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:55,909
These ones are chewy.

85
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,511
-These are the chewiest ones.
-Chewy.

86
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:58,712
Right.

87
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,147
GLUTINOUS CORN
CHEWY TEXTURE

88
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,715
-And these are soft.
-Soft.

89
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:03,183
SWEET CORN
SOFT TEXTURE

90
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,818
I can't even imagine.

91
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:06,720
I've never had chewy corn before.

92
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:08,455
-Do you want the chewy one?
-Yes.

93
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,323
Can we get two of these?

94
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:12,659
Thank you.

95
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,228
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

96
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,030
-Bye.
-Thank you.

97
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:19,266
-Can we eat them here?
-Sure.

98
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,568
It's hot!

99
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,806
This is interesting.
I've never seen this before.

100
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,841
The colors are so pretty.

101
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,145
Okay.

102
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,847
Let's dig in.

103
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,588
This is nothing like
what I thought it'd be.

104
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,524
There's no juicy burst.

105
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,393
It's more like a rice cake.

106
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,763
What's this big bag?

107
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,032
This is called ppeongtwigi.

108
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,100
Puffed grain snacks.

109
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,534
Ppeongtwigi.

110
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,037
You put this corn
in a cannon-shaped machine

111
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,940
and use high pressure
to heat and pop it.

112
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,575
-You have it in Japan too, right?
-Yes.

113
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,112
Ppeongtwigi.

114
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,013
-Ppeongtwigi.
-She wants you to try some.

115
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,316
-Really?
-Thank you.

116
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:10,751
Thank you.

117
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:14,755
So this is ppeongtwigi?

118
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,123
-Yes.
-Ppeongtwigi.

119
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,157
Tastes good.

120
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:19,159
-He said it's good.
-Have some more.

121
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:21,895
-Have some more.
-Are you sure? Thanks.

122
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,530
I like it.

123
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:28,368
In Korea, offering something just once
feels a little cold.

124
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,737
-So you offer again?
-Yes, twice.

125
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:33,573
-Just once feels cold.
-That's so kind.

126
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,811
This kind of kindness
still remains in traditional markets.

127
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:41,081
-Not in department stores.
-Of course not.

128
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:43,884
I can't say no to such kindness.

129
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,918
TAP TAP

130
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,053
-Are you sure?
-Yes, take it.

131
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,022
Oh, no. I ended up taking it!

132
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,257
Oh, man.

133
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:51,491
Thank you.

134
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:53,693
PROOF OF KINDNESS IN MARKETS
PPEONGTWIGI

135
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,562
Hello.

136
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,763
Hi.

137
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,232
The market's huge.

138
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:00,734
It is.

139
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:04,638
Water parsley is in season now.

140
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:06,907
I know you like water parsley.

141
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,575
Look, it's marinated crab.

142
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,244
Gejang.

143
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:13,346
What's this one?

144
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,049
That's also gejang,
marinated in soy sauce.

145
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:17,450
What about that one?

146
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,920
They're pickled chili peppers.

147
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,454
-That must be spicy.
-Yes.

148
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:22,856
This is gopchang.

149
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:26,660
He loves everything. We're barely moving.

150
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:30,297
-I'm glad you like this place.
-There is so much delicious food.

151
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,098
-What are these?
-Jeon, Korean pancakes.

152
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,733
-Jeon specialty shop?
-Yes.

153
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,368
Ginseng shop?

154
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,237
-What are these?
-Anchovies.

155
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:38,772
Should I buy some quail eggs?

156
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,640
-What's this?
-It's bellflower root.

157
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:41,641
You should try some.

158
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,809
We'll take this one.

159
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:46,046
-What's that?
-It's tteokgalbi, short rib patties.

160
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,114
-Let's try some.
-Can we get two?

161
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,854
It's delicious.

162
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,957
-Pork rinds?
-Yes.

163
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,593
-Pork rinds.
-Could we try a sample?

164
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,595
-Sure.
-Thank you.

165
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:02,896
He's giving you a sample.

166
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,866
Thank you.

167
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,738
It's a perfect drinking snack.

168
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,640
-Right?
-Yes.

169
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,209
Alcohol lovers would enjoy this.

170
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:18,478
That's best when it's grilled.

171
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,713
Your Japanese is really good.

172
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:23,250
I'm from Japan, near Funabashi.

173
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,618
-Funabashi?
-Yes.

174
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,554
-Wow.
-I lived in Japan for 35 years.

175
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,089
I see.

176
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,825
-I watch you on TV often.
-Thank you.

177
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:36,029
Nothing beats
grilling fresh pork rinds at a BBQ place.

178
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,731
-We had some.
-We had it.

179
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:38,999
It was great.

180
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,600
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

181
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:41,568
Keep it up.

182
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,036
-We will.
-Of course.

183
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:45,639
Tteokbokki and fish cake.

184
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,774
Is this a fish cake stall?

185
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:50,043
-It's a tteokbokki stall.
-I see.

186
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,914
FOOD STALL ALLEY INSIDE JEIL MARKET

187
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,682
They even have jjajang tteokbokki!

188
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,518
-Jjajang tteokbokki?
-With black bean sauce for jjajangmyeon.

189
00:06:58,585 --> 00:06:59,819
Let's try it.

190
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:02,622
-Have a seat.
-Please sit.

191
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:05,091
What brings you all the way here?

192
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:08,094
Hello. We're here
to look around Jeil Market.

193
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,796
I'm glad you came.

194
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,666
Can we get half jjajang tteokbokki
and half sundae?

195
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:15,302
-Half-and-half?
-Yes. Jjajang and sundae.

196
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,673
This is true Korean comfort food.

197
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,643
-Thank you.
-The portion is huge.

198
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,847
-Let's dig in.
-Enjoy.

199
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,658
-It's tasty.
-I'm glad you like it.

200
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:40,527
It's quite interesting.

201
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:42,662
It really is.

202
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:45,365
What is this?

203
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,301
-Fish cake soup broth.
-The broth.

204
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:49,836
It's fish cake soup broth.

205
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:52,038
It's free in Korea.

206
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:53,940
On the house?

207
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,714
The broth is good too.

208
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,969
The broth is amazing.

209
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,104
I'm glad.

210
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,872
On the way to our destination,

211
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,208
there's a place that sells
a dessert called hotteok.

212
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,743
-Hotteok.
-It's super good.

213
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,111
-Let's go.
-How much is it?

214
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,446
-On the house.
-No way, I have to pay.

215
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,415
Ma'am, it was delicious.

216
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:37,017
-Thank you.
-It really was.

217
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,051
-Thank you.
-Sure.

218
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:39,052
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

219
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,320
-Thank you.
-Okay.

220
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:44,357
Hotteok, a syrup-filled pancake,
is something every Korean loves.

221
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,292
-I see.
-If someone offers hotteok,

222
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,395
-nobody ever says no.
-Nobody?

223
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,662
Nobody.

224
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:52,298
There's the hotteok stand.

225
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,167
-Hello.
-Hi.

226
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,368
One hotteok, please.

227
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,171
-Okay.
-Is it 1,500 won?

228
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,172
That's right.

229
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:01,341
-You can put the money right there.
-Then make it two.

230
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:03,343
It's an honor system.

231
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,310
3,000 WON FOR TWO

232
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,179
Is this a snack?

233
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:10,250
Yes, it's a classic winter snack.

234
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:14,421
Is it an after-school snack for kids?

235
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:19,159
There used to be a grandma
sitting alone in front of the school,

236
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,927
making them by hand

237
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:23,196
and collecting money
with those same hands…

238
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:25,165
-Those were the best.
-I bet.

239
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,000
It was like 150 won each.

240
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,270
-That's how they used to sell them.
-Yes, back then.

241
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:33,406
The smell of sizzling oil

242
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,175
-is amazing.
-No doubt it tastes great.

243
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,377
-It must.
-It's fried in oil, after all.

244
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,316
-Do you eat it out of a cup?
-Yes.

245
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:46,886
It's hot, so don't squeeze the cup.

246
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,322
Thank you.

247
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:50,623
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

248
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,026
It's hot, so be careful.

249
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,329
This…

250
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,933
The cinnamon scent is amazing.

251
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,474
Delicious.

252
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,143
I'm glad you like it. This is…

253
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,145
This is the kind of flavor
every human loves.

254
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:13,513
No matter your age

255
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,748
-or nationality.
-Even Westerners would love it.

256
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:19,319
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

257
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:22,455
And finally, today's last stop

258
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,491
-is here.
-Okay.

259
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:28,461
Yes. The comfort food of Korea.
Fried chicken!

260
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:33,133
Traditional markets
sell tongdak, whole fried chicken.

261
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:38,471
FRIED CHICKEN ALLEY NEXT TO JEIL MARKET

262
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,676
Tongdak is the root
of Korean fried chicken.

263
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,645
They keep it authentic here.

264
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,747
So fried chicken is your soul food.

265
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,516
And ice-cold beer!

266
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:50,884
-Cold beer? Let's go.
-All right.

267
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,152
Let's head inside.

268
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,320
That's big!

269
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,256
Do they fry the whole chicken?

270
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,458
-Yes, usually the whole chicken.
-The whole chicken?

271
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,026
At the markets, yes.

272
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,395
What is this?

273
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:03,763
What could that be?

274
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,866
-Isn't it tofu? What is it?
-Can you eat it?

275
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,102
-Laundry soap.
-What?

276
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,270
It’s laundry soap.

277
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,805
She said this is soap.

278
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,207
Soap?

279
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,843
Do they make it here?

280
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,612
Yes, with the leftover grease
from frying chicken.

281
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,681
-It's upcycled soap.
-It's upcycled.

282
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,316
That's wild.

283
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:25,618
-Is this for sale? How much?
-Yes.

284
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,287
I never thought they'd make soap here.

285
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,556
-Me neither.
-Impressive.

286
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:30,690
-Shall we go in?
-Yes.

287
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,425
-After you.
-Welcome.

288
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:33,927
-Hello.
-Hello.

289
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:35,361
-Hi there.
-Thanks for having us.

290
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,629
Come on in.

291
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,532
-Hello.
-Hello.

292
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,167
-Lots of people are eating already.
-Hi.

293
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:42,969
Hello.

294
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:46,339
Are we having a fried chicken feast?

295
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:49,008
Are you already enjoying
a fried chicken feast?

296
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,677
Yes, we are.

297
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:53,112
Fried chicken and beer
really are a perfect match.

298
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,080
-Soju.
-Soju.

299
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,481
She's a real pro.

300
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,650
It's only lunchtime
and you're drinking already.

301
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,252
You started early today.

302
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,288
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

303
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,591
-Nice to meet you.
-Same here.

304
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,627
What should we order here?

305
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,929
-Walk me through the menu.
-Sure.

306
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,666
There's seasoned fried chicken with sauce.

307
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,901
-Sauce?
-Yes.

308
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:16,669
Is that the first one on the left?

309
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,072
Right, but the most popular
is the plain fried chicken.

310
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:21,541
-Fried chicken. The second one?
-Yes.

311
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:23,309
And that one is chicken gizzards.

312
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:24,410
-Gizzards?
-Yes.

313
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,446
-The one next to it is hearts.
-Okay.

314
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,548
-And neck.
-Neck.

315
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:32,552
That one is an assorted platter.

316
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:36,489
Neck, gizzards, and hearts.

317
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:37,624
-Hello.
-Hello.

318
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,625
-Hello.
-Yes.

319
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,893
-Fried chicken is the best one, right?
-That's right.

320
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,796
We'll have one.
Do you serve sauce on the side?

321
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,065
-Of course.
-And we'll add some garlic.

322
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:49,302
Fried chicken comes with
garlic and gizzards, on the house.

323
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:52,905
-Still, we'll add more. It's good for you.
-Add more?

324
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,874
Sorry for ordering things my way.

325
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,745
-And drinks?
-One draft beer, please.

326
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,113
One draft beer.

327
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:03,416
He brought non-alcoholic beer

328
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:05,451
-since he doesn't drink.
-Got it.

329
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,220
Please make it good.
And beer first, please.

330
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,688
-All right.
-I'm about to faint.

331
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:09,822
Okay.

332
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:14,494
I've never had fried chicken
served by parts before.

333
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,728
Really?

334
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,798
That’s the charm of market fried chicken.

335
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:20,633
You get to taste all the different cuts.

336
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,934
I see.

337
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:26,272
Neck, breast, thigh, wings, everything.

338
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,275
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

339
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,045
-Jjan!
-Jjan!

340
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:36,249
Jjan! Us too.

341
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,122
This is nice.

342
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:44,524
I feel so happy.

343
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,837
Beer tastes the best
after sweating it out in the market.

344
00:13:57,904 --> 00:13:59,772
Beer after a bath

345
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,741
and beer after a market stroll…

346
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:03,242
You really worked up a sweat.

347
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,845
At the hotteok stand…

348
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,348
-You got splattered with oil.
-Suddenly… Yes.

349
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:13,486
And draft beer at a market chicken place

350
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:17,323
is always fresh.
The kegs have a high turnover rate.

351
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,524
That's why it's so good.

352
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,693
There's a turnover rate for beer?

353
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,531
They clean the taps
and hook up a fresh keg every day.

354
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:29,001
Because it's always fresh,
the taste is guaranteed.

355
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:33,406
That's a drinker's logic.

356
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,974
-This is…
-A basic side dish?

357
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,476
Yes, we call the sauce "keyonnaise."

358
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,644
-It's ketchup mixed with mayo.
-Ketchup and mayo.

359
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,679
Right.

360
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,418
-Is it good?
-Yes.

361
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,287
Depending on who you ask,

362
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,056
some call it "Aurora sauce" in Japan.

363
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,457
Aurora sauce?

364
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,160
AURORA SAUCE

365
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,130
A SAUCE MADE BY MIXING
MAYONNAISE AND KETCHUP

366
00:14:57,196 --> 00:15:00,533
NAMED FOR ITS COLOR
WHICH RESEMBLES THE NORTHERN LIGHTS

367
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,569
This is pickled radish,
called chicken mu.

368
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,071
Chicken mu!

369
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,672
It's sweet and tangy.

370
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:11,978
With all that fried chicken,

371
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:15,481
the radish cuts through the grease

372
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:16,916
and keeps you going.

373
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:19,452
So it's like namasu.

374
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,655
It's pickled radish eaten
on New Year's in Japan.

375
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:26,459
Is the chicken already seasoned?

376
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:29,629
Yes, but the flavor
is lighter than karaage.

377
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:33,566
-Japanese chicken is stronger in flavor.
-True.

378
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:37,136
The batter for Korean fried chicken
isn't as strongly flavored

379
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:38,704
as karaage, Japanese fried chicken.

380
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,773
So you dip it in salt

381
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,742
or sauce.

382
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:45,445
With a drink, you can…

383
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:46,746
Keep going?

384
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,749
You eat some radish,
then go back for more chicken.

385
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,717
No matter how you look at it,

386
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:56,255
they don't look like
they're eating karaage.

387
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,693
-He's right. To a Japanese person…
-Amazing.

388
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,329
…it must look like
they've stacked up karaage.

389
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:06,232
It's like a mountain of karaage…

390
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:07,733
Here it comes!

391
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,204
-That's ours?
-Yes.

392
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:14,941
-Are you sure?
-Positive.

393
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,078
It's here.

394
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:22,181
-Here you go.
-It's amazing.

395
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:25,651
-Here.
-I thought it was one big chunk.

396
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,453
It's got some serious presence.

397
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,755
It sure does.

398
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,306
FRIED CHICKEN
21,000 WON, 2,100 YEN

399
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,409
COMES WITH FRIED GIZZARDS AND GARLIC
EXTRA GARLIC 5,000 WON

400
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,679
I've never been faced with such
a huge amount of fried chicken before.

401
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,650
This is…

402
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:59,085
You can use this plastic…

403
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,086
Plastic gloves?

404
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,822
-You can use it to eat with your hands.
-Okay.

405
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,290
-With my hands?
-Yes.

406
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,893
-Is this garlic?
-Yes.

407
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,128
That's insane.

408
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,631
-They fried the garlic, too.
-Yes.

409
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:16,402
Since it's fried, it doesn’t smell.
And it's sweet. Try some.

410
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,638
-Let me taste it for poison.
-Don't mind if I do.

411
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,540
It's good for you.

412
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,508
The garlic.

413
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,812
This will keep me up all night.

414
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,214
Right?

415
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:30,616
It gets you all fired up.

416
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,420
All right. Pick a piece.

417
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:35,755
Is this the drumette?

418
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,290
This is…

419
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,492
I can't tell what size this chicken is.

420
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,261
This is the upper part of the wing, right?

421
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:43,529
The upper wing part.

422
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:44,497
This is…

423
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,366
Is this the leg?

424
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:48,301
-Is this the leg?
-Yes.

425
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,436
-It's this part of the chicken?
-This is the leg.

426
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,204
This is the wing.

427
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,473
No, this is the upper wing part.

428
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:56,042
No, this is the wing.

429
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,511
-Oh, I mixed it up.
-That's the wing.

430
00:17:58,778 --> 00:17:59,845
-Here is the wing.
-Okay.

431
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,581
-I meant this part right here.
-Right.

432
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:04,984
-And this is the leg?
-Yes.

433
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,219
Koreans love drumsticks the most.

434
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:08,487
-All right.
-Go on.

435
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:09,722
Let me try this.

436
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,158
It's hot!

437
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,798
How is it?

438
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:23,436
It barely tastes seasoned.

439
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:24,804
In a good way,

440
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,073
it tastes like nothing.

441
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:31,677
It's just the pure flavor of chicken.

442
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:35,648
It’s so mild,
I can't even tell if it’s been seasoned.

443
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,550
That's why you dip it in salt.

444
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,886
His explanation was on point.

445
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,456
If I had to exaggerate,
it almost tastes like nothing at all.

446
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,724
Just a subtle richness.

447
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,526
They probably salted it beforehand.

448
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,830
Before frying,

449
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,865
the chicken is brined,

450
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:54,867
which means it's left to rest

451
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:58,070
so the meat is gently seasoned with salt.

452
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,911
You get the pure taste
of the chicken and the oil.

453
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:06,979
Just the savory flavor.

454
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:09,181
I could keep eating just this.

455
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,884
They're not using strong seasoning

456
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:15,955
-to make you drink more.
-I get what you mean.

457
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,556
I think the light seasoning

458
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,126
actually allows us to drink more.

459
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,194
If the seasoning is too strong,

460
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,997
you can't drink as much.

461
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,333
-Because you get too full.
-Right.

462
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,771
When the chicken flavor
starts to feel plain,

463
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,340
-the sauce helps.
-It changes up the taste.

464
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:35,307
-Tastes great.
-I agree.

465
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:49,155
And there are chicken wings too.

466
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:53,192
They're the part
the chicken uses the most.

467
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,327
-Yes.
-So they're tasty.

468
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,106
Honestly, dipping it
in salt is the best way.

469
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:14,547
Because there's nothing extra

470
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:17,049
added to it,

471
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:20,720
it feels like I’m enjoying
the true flavor of the chicken.

472
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:23,556
I brought you here to show you

473
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:27,626
that this kind of fried chicken
was a thing back then.

474
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:31,630
Fried chicken these days
is a whole different story.

475
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,100
-Flavor-wise?
-The flavor, the batter,

476
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,168
and the way it's made.

477
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,338
-Is this the OG Korean fried chicken?
-Yes.

478
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,073
I'm pretty certain that it is.

479
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,208
The OG.

480
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:46,412
Are there many places like this in Korea?

481
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:49,949
You can always find one
at traditional markets.

482
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:54,019
Can you get this to-go?

483
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,154
-Of course.
-I see.

484
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,255
To-go.

485
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,657
That was how it was back then.

486
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:01,594
Fathers would bring home
a whole fried chicken

487
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:03,796
on payday

488
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:06,332
or when something good happened,

489
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,735
or when a company dinner ran late,
and they felt bad for the family.

490
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:11,036
-They'd bring it home.
-So

491
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,339
the kids weren't actually excited
to see their father.

492
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:17,109
They'd rush to the door
as soon as they smelled chicken.

493
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:19,645
-It totally lifted the mood.
-And they'd say, "Dad, I love you."

494
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:21,947
The fried chicken

495
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:25,951
brought home by your dad around midnight

496
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:29,221
-was special.
-Even if he reeked of booze.

497
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,357
And to eat it,

498
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,693
you had to put up with
your dad’s drunken kisses.

499
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,429
You had to stay awake.

500
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:44,470
There's this word, chimaek,

501
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,739
which means chicken and beer.

502
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,241
-I know. The perfect combo.
-Right.

503
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,944
It's even in
the Oxford English Dictionary now

504
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,346
as a proper noun.

505
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:08,527
This is nice.

506
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:10,563
The fact that chimaek,
fried chicken and beer,

507
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,832
is in the Oxford English Dictionary…

508
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:14,633
Chances are, it was Koreans who put it in.

509
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,669
Yes. Probably.

510
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,039
-Whoever added it deserves respect.
-Thank you.

511
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:23,175
You just had your first taste of chimaek.

512
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:24,210
I got into chimaek.

513
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,845
Chimaek.

514
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,181
-Is this chicken gizzard?
-Yes.

515
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:31,750
I’ve never seen fried gizzards before.

516
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:39,592
The seasoning is really light.

517
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:44,263
If you eat it as is,
you can barely taste the salt.

518
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:54,740
Can I have the neck?

519
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:56,141
Yes, go ahead.

520
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,476
I love neck meat.

521
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,045
Maybe that's because I'm a singer.

522
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,081
Do you like the neck?

523
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:03,215
Yes, I do.

524
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,253
-The neck meat?
-Yes.

525
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:12,458
I eat it like I'm playing the harmonica.

526
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:20,733
Excuse me.

527
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,069
-What set has chicken neck?
-We do one that's just neck.

528
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:27,306
That sounds amazing. At least for me.

529
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:28,507
What's going on?

530
00:23:28,757 --> 00:23:29,792
One chicken neck set,

531
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,344
-and one more beer, please.
-Didn't we get everything?

532
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,546
-What did you get?
-Neck.

533
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:37,249
You can get a plate of just necks.

534
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:39,551
I love chicken neck so much.

535
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,187
I ordered it.

536
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,290
There was only one neck in here, right?

537
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:45,624
Yes, since it's a whole chicken.

538
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:50,896
Surprisingly, I like the gizzards.

539
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:55,401
We don't have fried gizzards in Japan.

540
00:23:57,503 --> 00:24:00,172
At fried chicken places in Korean markets,

541
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:03,108
you'll always find fried gizzards.

542
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:05,077
-Really?
-It's called dakttongjip-twigim.

543
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,613
I've never seen fried chicken

544
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:11,917
sold in its different parts
like this before.

545
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:12,985
-Really?
-Yes.

546
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:14,853
This is common in Korea.

547
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,257
At karaage shops in Japan,

548
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:22,027
it's just thigh and breast,

549
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:25,664
with wings sold separately,

550
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:30,803
but neck is never offered
as a separate dish.

551
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,638
And definitely no gizzards.

552
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,874
I never thought to fry them.

553
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:40,579
But at yakitori places like Toritaka,

554
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,915
you can eat various parts.

555
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:46,885
Yakitori is a whole different culture.

556
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:49,088
Just like at yakitori restaurants,

557
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,856
you get to see all the various parts

558
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:52,658
in fried chicken places like this.

559
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:55,027
Here you go.

560
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:56,428
-This is…
-Neck.

561
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:58,530
That looks completely different.

562
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:04,036
CHICKEN NECK
11,000 WON, 1,100 YEN

563
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:07,139
I've never had fried neck meat.

564
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:09,475
-These have bones.
-Okay.

565
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,477
-So you eat…
-This…

566
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:12,745
-…around the bone?
-Yes.

567
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:21,153
-Is it this part of the chicken?
-Yes.

568
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:27,960
It's amazing.

569
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:30,062
-Is it?
-Yes.

570
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:31,463
This…

571
00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:34,066
really changed up the flavor.

572
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:36,201
-I'm glad you like it.
-It's delicious.

573
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,942
They probably throw this away in Japan.

574
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:47,479
They might debone the neck

575
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:50,482
and use it for yakitori.

576
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:53,652
I think I've seen neck meat
at yakitori places,

577
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,188
but never as karaage.

578
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,761
So do singers really like the neck?

579
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:07,299
Not really…

580
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:10,903
You said earlier that singers love it.

581
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:14,473
-That's just a silly rumor.
-All right.

582
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:18,210
Like how if you have a headache,
you eat the brain,

583
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:19,611
and if your throat hurts,

584
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:21,113
you eat neck meat.

585
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,515
What do you eat before a big concert?

586
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,717
Or drink?

587
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:28,720
I fast.

588
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:29,855
What?

589
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,256
-I don't really eat.
-You don't?

590
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:32,291
Not before concerts.

591
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:34,326
If I get nervous,
my stomach gets unsettled.

592
00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:35,494
Really?

593
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:45,704
-The neck is delicious.
-That makes me happy.

594
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:50,175
I was surprised

595
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:53,312
Koreans have been eating like this

596
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,114
all along.

597
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,516
When there are fried gizzards,
everyone loves them.

598
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:59,551
"Gizzards! Let’s get fried gizzards!"

599
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:00,819
People get excited.

600
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:02,888
And people who favor the neck?
Are they freaks?

601
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:05,624
Neck fans are rare.

602
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:07,226
-So they're freaks.
-Freaks.

603
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,995
If you see someone who orders
just a plate of neck meat…

604
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:12,131
-Yeah.
-…that's a freaky singer.

605
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:13,999
THE NEXT INSANELY GOOD SPOT

606
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:16,268
Season three has begun.

607
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:17,936
We're on the road.

608
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,671
SEASON THREE
ON-THE-ROAD FOOD BATTLE

609
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:22,908
We're not on our home turf.

610
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,277
A first-time experience for both of us.

611
00:27:25,598 --> 00:27:28,313
TWO FOODIES ON A CULINARY ROAD TRIP

612
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,352
This is killer!

613
00:27:35,316 --> 00:27:36,655
KILLER LOCAL SPOTS ON THE ROAD

614
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:40,492
Japan has tons of
charming little places, right?

615
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,227
Now it feels like I'm back in Korea.

616
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:44,096
Busan is all about pork gukbap.

617
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,531
AND LEE DAE-HO

618
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:47,065
LOCAL FOODIE'S INSANELY GOOD SPOT

619
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:48,267
Let's trust him.

620
00:27:48,804 --> 00:27:50,329
A FRIEND WITH A BIG APPETITE

621
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:53,105
This is killer.

622
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,107
HIDDEN GEMS ON THE ROAD

623
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:56,308
We're starving.

624
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:59,378
Take us to an insanely good spot.

625
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,446
You never know what will happen.

626
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:03,248
Excuse me.

627
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:05,284
It's not open yet.

628
00:28:05,918 --> 00:28:07,319
This episode is getting wild.

629
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,421
-This is killer.
-This is killer.
