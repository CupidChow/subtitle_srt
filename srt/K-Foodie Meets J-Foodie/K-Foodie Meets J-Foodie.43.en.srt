K-foodie meets J-foodie.

7
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:33,233
This is insane.

8
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:39,005
Sungnyemun.

9
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:40,473
Right. It's Sungnyemun.

10
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:44,744
SUNGNYEMUN
KOREA'S NATIONAL TREASURE NO. 1

11
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:46,346
"Sung" is "to elevate,"
"rye" is "propriety," "mun" is "gate."

12
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,314
"Sung" as in "sublime"?

13
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,849
It's the "sung" as in "revere."

14
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,718
And "rye" is the character for propriety.

15
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:54,320
Together it means "to revere propriety."

16
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,361
It stands guard over central Seoul.

17
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:05,765
So, was a Joseon palace nearby?

18
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:08,201
-The palaces are a bit farther.
-Farther in?

19
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:11,938
This is central Seoul,
so lots of foreign visitors come.

20
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,073
I've been here before.

21
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:14,607
You took photos last time, right?

22
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:16,276
I came when it was cold.

23
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,278
I think it was snowing.

24
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:21,915
Today's restaurant is pretty new.

25
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:25,285
It's only about a year old.

26
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,754
Is this a spot you know?

27
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,989
I introduced it on YouTube.

28
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:33,626
Wow…

29
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:35,495
Get a taste of what the King felt.

30
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,531
I should really explain…

31
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:42,535
Oh, man.

32
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,005
Should I bring Mr. Goro here?

33
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,008
Yes, we have to bring him here.

34
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:50,777
He needs to taste this.

35
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,579
SINSEOLLO

36
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:55,215
Some viewers have said,

37
00:01:55,915 --> 00:02:01,955
"We know Si-kyung and
Mr. Matjjigae love old spots,

38
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:06,993
but why don't you show
more refined places in Korea?"

39
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,563
So we picked this place
to show that side of Korea as well.

40
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,067
Huh?

41
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,768
Interesting. We're going in here?

42
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:16,669
Yes.

43
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,939
So far, most of the restaurants
were along the street.

44
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:20,874
Right.

45
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,877
This is insane.

46
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:24,878
An office building?

47
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:27,947
This isn't a restaurant strip.

48
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,150
Hello.

49
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:32,819
Do we need to check in at the reception?

50
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,154
-This way.
-So not here.

51
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,289
What is this place?

52
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,425
It doesn't even smell like food.

53
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,426
Let's just head in.

54
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:46,065
At Pildong Myeonok,
the noodles had a springy bite,

55
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,433
because of the starch.

56
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,169
Here it's 100% buckwheat.

57
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:50,436
-Is this it?
-Yes.

58
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,106
-It popped up out of nowhere.
-Yes.

59
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,073
What's it called?

60
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,842
-Seoryeong.
-Seoryeong.

61
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,311
Very upscale.

NATIONAL-TREASURE KOREAN CUISINE

67
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,235
Hold on.

68
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,304
It says "state banquet."

69
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,207
"State banquet."

70
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,475
If it's for state banquets,

71
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,178
does that mean formal dishes?

72
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,580
Yes.

73
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:35,481
They obsess over ingredients.

74
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,417
Everything's fresh and top-tier.

75
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:38,885
The moment I tasted it,

76
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,121
it made me think of my parents
or senior peers.

77
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,924
-I see.
-So today we're having sinseollo.

78
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:50,663
-Sinseollo?
-Sinseollo is the name of the pot,

79
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,432
and it's a royal court dish.

80
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,334
What's royal court cuisine?

81
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,070
Even in Japan, if you say "royal cuisine,"

82
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:58,638
people don't really know what that is.

83
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:02,308
Even if you said,
"Please take me to a royal cuisine place,"

84
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:06,112
no Japanese person
would know where to take you.

85
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:09,849
I don't know every single detail either,

86
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,353
but sinseollo has been known
since long ago,

87
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,855
and people know
that it's royal court cuisine.

88
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:17,890
Here's the menu.

89
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,193
SEORYEONG TRADITIONAL SINSEOLLO

90
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,661
One sinseollo, please.

91
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:23,863
And?

92
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,032
-Bulgogi.
-Bulgogi!

93
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,533
Two orders of bulgogi, please.

94
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,868
Certainly.

95
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:32,272
-Buckwheat noodles to finish?
-Right.

96
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,507
Until then, we could visit a palace

97
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:39,078
or try some Seoul-style bulgogi.

98
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,447
What would you like to drink?

99
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,516
What about you? Beer?

100
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,452
They have something interesting here.

101
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,022
-It's called jjabaegi.
-Jjabaegi.

102
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:52,191
They fill a glass to the brim with soju.

103
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:54,093
-It's 2,000 won.
-That's cheap.

104
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,762
So it's just one glass, then.

105
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,664
I'll have that.

106
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,564
ORDER

107
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,600

109
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,339
Excuse me.

110
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,807
-It's here.
-Here it comes.

111
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,109
I've never seen sinseollo before.

112
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:13,279
A pot with this kind of shape
is called a sinseollo.

113
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:19,018
SINSEOLLO
120,000 WON / 12,000 YEN

114
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:20,920

LATE JOSEON TEXT

121
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:46,913
They serve beef even in royal cuisine.

122
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,581
Korea is remarkable.

123
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,020
-Would you like to try just the broth?
-Yes.

124
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,222
I'll have a taste first.

125
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:06,399
This is it.

126
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,167
This is insane.

127
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,044
The aroma is complex.

128
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,446
The broth is excellent.

129
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,517
You know,

130
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:30,823
I don't usually like beef-based broth.

131
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,525
-You don't?
-Not really.

132
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:37,196
But there's no off smell
from the beef at all.

133
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,598
That's a relief.

134
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:42,468
This is… refined.

135
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:43,770
-This is classy.
-It is.

136
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,271
Royal court cuisine.

137
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,408
Should I have dressed up?

138
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,209
No, not at all.

139
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,779
I'm not exactly someone
who gets into palaces.

140
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,447
What do you mean?

141
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:58,885
As an actor,
I've never played high-status roles.

142
00:06:58,951 --> 00:06:59,786
Never.

143
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:02,622
I've always played the lowest of the low.

144
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,891
Have you never played a noble?

145
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:08,661
Just samurai, yakuza, or cops.

146
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:09,962
Right.

147
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,899
You'd look the part of a king.

148
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,134
Sorry, I don't have that noble look.

149
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,404
It's starting to boil.

150
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:38,524
Will you serve us,
or do we help ourselves?

151
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,760
-We'll serve.
-That'd be great.

152
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,528
Feels like a true treat today.

153
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:45,598
-It really does feel that way.
-It does.

154
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:50,036
A fully hosted Insanely Good Spot.

155
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,103
Please enjoy.

156
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,907
First off, sinseollo includes jeon.

157
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,477
-Eh, jeon?
-We call it yukjeon.

158
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:02,315
Beef lightly coated in egg,
then pan-fried.

159
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,785
-What's this?
-Fish jeon.

160
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,987
-It's cod jeon.
-Cod jeon.

161
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:12,992
I don't really get the idea
of simmering jeon in a hot pot.

162
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:16,429
Putting jeon in the pot
and letting it go soft…

163
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:20,399
It feels nothing like
classic royal court cuisine.

164
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,470
It even feels very homey.

165
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,072
So unpretentious.

166
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:29,609
You can picture kids
eating it in modest homes.

167
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,943
That's Korea.

168
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,144
We do eat like that sometimes.

169
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,447
After memorial rites,
leftover jeon goes in kimchi jjigae.

170
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,448
Really?

171
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,650
Shank.

172
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,820
Beef brisket, called yangji.

173
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,522
-Briskey?
-Brisket.

174
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:43,789
This cut here.

175
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:47,126
It makes a really rich broth.

176
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,694
-What's this?
-Beef tendon.

177
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:50,696
Beef tendon.

178
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:55,701
We grind beef and shrimp
to make the meatballs.

179
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:57,103
This one's a sirloin roll.

180
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,504
Beef and scallion roll.

181
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,341
Do we dip this?

182
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:03,442
Do we dip this one?

183
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,279
Stir in some mustard,
then dip in the sauce.

184
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:09,081
Mix the mustard, then dip in the sauce.

185
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,786
-Thank you.
-Thank you for the food.

186
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:14,854
Thank you.

187
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,424
The sirloin roll first, right?

188
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,473
Delicious.

189
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:39,679
It's so good.

190
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:44,150
Ah, scallion rolls.

191
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,892
Even the seasoning and ingredients
in sinseollo feel new.

192
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,128
This really is my first time.

193
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,732
The idea of putting jeon into the pot

194
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,367
is honestly hard to grasp.

195
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,869
You don't really get it until you try it.

196
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,747
The yukjeon is great.

197
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:15,915
I'm glad to hear that.

198
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,021
For example, tempura udon?

199
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:26,592
Why drop crispy tempura in,
just to eat it soggy?

200
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:27,960
It feels similar to that.

201
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,095
Got it.

202
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:33,399
If you add tempura
to doenjang soup a day later,

203
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,502
-it becomes a whole new taste.
-Exactly.

204
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,672
Next up, the cod jeon?

205
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:44,677
Delicious.

206
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:54,520
I like this jijimi.

207
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:55,755
Yukjeon.

208
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,690
We call it yukjeon.

209
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:01,327
"Jijimi" is actually Busan dialect.

210
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:04,096
-Really?
-They call jeon "jijimi."

211
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,099
Maybe because it's close to Japan?

212
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,135
In Japan,
people tend to say "jijimi" for jeon.

213
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:12,438
-Right.
-But it's really jeon.

214
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,941
So meat jeon is yukjeon,

215
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,011
scallion jeon is pajeon,

216
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,380
and fish jeon is saengseon jeon.

217
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:22,882
Jeon.

218
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,120
The cod jeon was good too.

219
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,191
That's already my third yukjeon.

220
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:44,136
Call it broth or sauce, it's really tasty.

221
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:48,507
These meatballs
have shrimp ground in, right?

222
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:06,726
And this beef tendon.

223
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,403
What's great about sinseollo is

224
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,573
how many different ingredients it holds.

225
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,942
There's so much variety in the flavors.

226
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:26,879
Of course,
the broth gives it overall unity.

227
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,225
So good.

228
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,260
Try some broth too.

229
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,032
-Is it okay if I drink from the bowl?
-Yes.

230
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,770
The broth keeps getting better.

231
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,779
Different from the first sip, right?

232
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:03,382
A soft sweetness
comes from the vegetables.

233
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:10,456
And there's no off smell
from the beef at all.

234
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:16,695
When it's boiled this long,
you'd expect a beefy off smell.

235
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:19,398
They must have prepped it with real care.

236
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,067
They must take great care with the broth.

237
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,638
-Makes sense.
-They simmer it 24 hours a day.

238
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,110
This is done right.

239
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:37,082
A broth made with real care.

240
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:41,687
I think this is my first time
liking beef broth this much.

241
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,055
Wow, really?

242
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,690
Sinseollo is incredible.

243
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:47,459
That's why I wanted to bring you.

244
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:51,030
-The sinseollo comes in a big portion.
-It is.

245
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:54,667
Some might say it's pricey,

246
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:58,938
but it's better than ordering
four portions at a regular beef spot.

247
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,775
Sinseollo is healthy and you can
get unlimited refills of broth.

248
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,844
I think it's really great.

249
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,713
If I have Japanese friends,

250
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,316
I'd want to bring them here.

251
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:13,552
Say this place is full,

252
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:17,456
you probably couldn't find
a comparable spot.

253
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,125
I could try,
but I don't know anywhere else.

254
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,193
Really?

255
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,132
-This place is it.
-This is it?

256
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,200
Everyone, please come.

257
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:31,637
If old-school spots
are a bit much, come here.

258
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,505
This is also Korea.

259
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,407
If you want to eat

260
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,978
the way you imagined you would in Korea,

261
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,146
it's better to look around first

262
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,215
and come here last.

263
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,217
It's close to Myeong-dong.

264
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:46,418
It's a 5-minute walk.

265
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,993
Shall we move on
from sinseollo to bulgogi?

266
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,227
Let's do that.

267
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:56,595
Shall we set the broth aside?

268
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,098
-We'll set some broth aside.
-Okay.

269
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,299
The broth is delicious.

270
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,102
I'll end up wanting the broth later.

271
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:04,737
Just the broth, please.

272
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:06,305
Just the broth.

273
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,441
That's fine. It's good.

274
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,849
This is the bulgogi griddle.

275
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,052
Here it is.

276
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,288
Is this the bulgogi beef?

277
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:28,560
BULGOGI (2 SERVINGS)
78,000 WON / 7,800 YEN

278
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,195
Is this Seoul-style bulgogi?

279
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,797
This is Seoul-style bulgogi.

280
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:32,898
We use outstanding beef.

281
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,267
We use sirloin with a BMS grade of 9.

282
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:39,338
QUALITY GRADES (1++, 1+, 1, 2, 3)
+ BEEF MARBLING SCORE (BMS)

283
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:44,376
= FINAL KOREAN BEEF GRADE

284
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,579
BEEF MARBLING SCORE (BMS)

285
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:52,284
SCORED 1 TO 9
NO. 9 IS TOP

286
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,220
1++ NO. 9

287
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:59,224
HIGHEST GRADE POSSIBLE
FOR KOREAN BEEF

288
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:00,859
Wow, that's dope.

289
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:05,531
He said, "That's dope."

290
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,199
That's a first.

291
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,233
Wow, that's dope.

292
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,235
He basically said, "That's sick."

293
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:11,804
For the first time.

294
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,649
Speaking of bulgogi,

295
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:30,823
it comes partly cooked
in Japanese restaurants.

296
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:34,460
So what is real bulgogi here?

297
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:37,062
In Korea, there are three major styles.

298
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,530
Three major bulgogi styles.

299
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:42,468
Seoul, Eonyang, or Gwangyang.

300
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,070
Eonyang-style is not marinated.

301
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,840
It's seasoned when the order comes in

302
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:49,475
and grilled right away.

303
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:55,614
GWANGYANG BULGOGI
THIN, WIDE SLICES, CHARCOAL GRILLED

304
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,785
Seoul-style is marinated so much,

305
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,453
that there's a broth.

306
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:06,925
All of the juices and umami
drip into the broth.

307
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,929
You can add noodles to it

308
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:13,532
or mix all the broth into rice.

309
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,667
In Korea, we don't leave broth behind.

310
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:30,516
Not yet?

311
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,551
Is it not ready yet?

312
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,053
Almost there. One moment.

313
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,727
So this is Seoul-style bulgogi.

314
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,064
It's my first time.

315
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,966
This is also a type of bulgogi.

316
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:50,069
But this is top-grade bulgogi.

317
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:03,849
How is it?

318
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:09,822
I don't think there is
any flaw to point out here.

319
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:14,793
Even as a banchan, this combo is great.

320
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:20,332
Awesome.

321
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,979
By the way, how much is this bulgogi?

322
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:34,913
It's 38,000 won.

323
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,716
-It's cheap.
-Per person.

324
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,418
-Is this for two?
-Yes.

325
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,987
For this quality, it's a bargain.

326
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:45,457
Since it's not a place
you visit every week.

327
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,559
-Even for Koreans, right?
-Of course.

328
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,395
I didn't really get what bulgogi was,

329
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,964
but this bulgogi really…

330
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,000
Comparing it to sukiyaki
would be an insult.

331
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,436
They're completely different dishes.

332
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,805
This is refined.

333
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:03,275
It may look similar,
but it tastes nothing like sukiyaki.

334
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:06,278
Different, yes.

335
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:07,346
SUKIYAKI

336
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:10,449
MEAT AND VEGETABLES
SIMMERED IN A SWEET SOY BROTH

337
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,185
Sukiyaki tends to have a stronger flavor.

338
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:16,321
-Beat a raw egg.
-Dip the meat into it.

339
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,957
It's a unique way
to tone down the seasoning.

340
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:21,660
And Japanese sukiyaki doesn't use garlic.

341
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,462
Right. Bulgogi uses garlic.

342
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,696
It's in the sauce.

343
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,605
This is really good.

344
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,478
Seriously, so good.

345
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:41,446
The broth is awesome.

346
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:47,553
Don't you eat bulgogi with rice?

347
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,722
Usually, we eat it with rice.

348
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,224
Mix this sauce in and stir…

349
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,026
Could I get just half a bowl of rice?

350
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,161
-Can we get a little bit of rice…
-Okay.

351
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,429
Rice, please.

352
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:00,732
Here you go.

353
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:01,867
Thank you.

354
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,438
Let me try this once.

355
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:07,439
Go ahead.

356
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,175
As much as you like.

357
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,277
This part is great.

358
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:13,812
-Right.
-That's tteokssim.

359
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,448
It's the chewy part.

360
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,917
In Japan, there are gyudon shops.

361
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:20,352
This is kind of like gyudon.

362
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:24,690
Gyudon is an everyday dish in Japan.

363
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:28,293
It's the most common and cheap.

364
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,762
Even when I crave gyudon,

365
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:34,299
if I go eat it at a shop,

366
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:37,436
-it can get a little noisy.
-Right.

367
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:38,804
They say, "Mr. Matjjigae's here!"

368
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,372
So I can hardly eat it.

369
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:45,043
This is drenched
in top-grade bulgogi broth.

370
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,311
That's right.

371
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:48,113
Sorry. I'm going to lift the bowl.

372
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,016
Of course. It's fine in Korea too.

373
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,162
Suddenly he's in Inogashira mode.

374
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:12,437
It suddenly feels like
The Solitary Gourmet.

375
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:23,482
Awesome.

376
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,785
This bulgogi rice bowl is insane.

377
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,588
-Want to try some? Bulgogi rice bowl.
-Sure.

378
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,230
Add scallions on top too.

379
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:48,440
Good, right?

380
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,879
This bulgogi rice bowl is great.

381
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,921
Why is this rice so good?

382
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,624
This sauce makes the rice even better.

383
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:06,692
Amazing.

384
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,862
This place will be a great memory.

385
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,566
It's not a spot you can visit easily.

386
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:15,567
Nice.

387
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,704
If we get another chance,

388
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:22,607
there's a cheaper place than this.

389
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:26,411
A down-to-earth butcher's
bulgogi joint I can show you.

390
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:30,315
Then let's order naengmyeon
before we're too full.

391
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:31,383
Shall we?

392
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,118
There are three kinds.

393
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,720
Spicy bibim naengmyeon.

394
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:38,156
Naengmyeon served in this broth.

395
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:40,826
Deulgireum mixed noodles.

396
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:42,027
What do you recommend?

397
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:46,264
The deulgireum noodles
and a clear Pyongyang-style naengmyeon.

398
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:51,002
One deulgireum makguksu and
one Pyongyang-style naengmyeon, please.

399
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,137
Certainly.

400
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:55,474
-This place is special.
-Is it?

401
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,144
They've devoted their life
to buckwheat noodles,

402
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,413
and it's different from
Pyongyang naengmyeon too.

403
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,516
It's Pyongyang-style,

404
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,651
but at heart it's makguksu.

405
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:07,786
-Makguksu.
-Makguksu?

406
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:13,358
In Korean, "mak" can mean
"roughly" or "right away,"

407
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:14,760
and "guksu" means noodles.

408
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:17,195
Here, they've been…

409
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:18,930
Wow, that was fast.

410
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:20,732
Here it is.

411
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:25,604
SEORYEONG SUNMYEON
17,000 WON / 1,700 YEN

412
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:32,778
DEULGIREUM SUNMYEON
17,000 WON / 1,700 YEN

413
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:35,380
It looks exactly like soba.

414
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:36,882
They're both buckwheat noodles.

415
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:38,417
Like soba.

416
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:45,223
SEORYEONG SUNMYEON

417
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,202
This is new to me.

418
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,409
Delicious.

419
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,490
From a Japanese point of view,

420
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:23,595
it doesn't really feel like naengmyeon.

421
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:26,097
At famous naengmyeon places in Korea,

422
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:31,269
the noodles aren't this soft,
or this easy to snap.

423
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:33,038
They have a bit of springiness.

424
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:34,639
They're not 100% buckwheat.

425
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:38,543
Naengmyeon isn't just the noodles.

426
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:42,113
It's a dish of cold broth clean and clear,

427
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:46,017
that also includes the noodles.
That's naengmyeon.

428
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:47,586
Let's taste the broth.

429
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:02,634
It's clean,

430
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:06,571
but it's still proper beef stock.

431
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,608
That umami punch really hits your nose.

432
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,962
This is great. So tasty.

433
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:34,633
I'm not from an area
where soba is heavily prevalent.

434
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,936
-I'm more of an udon person.
-Kyushu.

435
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:41,139
Even in Tokyo, I'm no soba expert.

436
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:47,412
So for me, tasting buckwheat noodles

437
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:50,081
in these two ways is a real surprise.

438
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:51,416
I'm glad to hear it.

439
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:01,393
As for this one…

440
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:03,428
Which do you prefer?

441
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:06,064
Score-wise, they're exactly tied.

442
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,332
-Really?
-Yes.

443
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,407
Delicious.

444
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:19,177
If I can, I'd alternate between the two.

445
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,647
And the soju too.

446
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,583
I'd go back and forth
between broth and soju.

447
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,786
Liquor and medicine.

448
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:30,655
Cheers.

449
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:35,360
Cheers.

450
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,262
Tasty.

451
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:38,496
So good.

452
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:41,333
I really wanted
to bring Mr. Matjjigae here.

453
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,902
-It's really good, right?
-Yes.

454
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:48,206
I keep going back and forth like we said.

455
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,774
My chopsticks won't stop.

456
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,843
THE NEXT INSANELY GOOD SPOT

457
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:55,113
Take us to Busan's insanely good spots.

458
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,283
You never know what's going to happen.

459
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,019
FOOD EXPERT ON THE ROAD
TAXI DRIVERS

460
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:03,288
IN SEARCH OF BUSAN'S BEST SPOT

461
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:04,823
Isn't this a mega episode?

462
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:06,558
I'm not kidding. Seriously.

463
